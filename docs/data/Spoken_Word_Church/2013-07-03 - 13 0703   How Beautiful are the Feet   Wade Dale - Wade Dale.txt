Bible up and he's reading first Peter and he's reading the way you you can't see the people in the in the seats and they're going stop whoa no that's not it stop right there whoa whoa stop and I mean they're all going stop stop he was in First Peter and should have been in second Peter so they're a pretty rough crowd down there now they'll they'll stay on you so so he got uh I told them out in uh brother dut Scott that uh probably you hadn't done that in about 35 or 40 years so that was uh that was a uh a treat to say the least and it was just absolute needed Sunday school class and uh I know everybody enjoyed brother Bob Sunday morning did a wonderful job just keep him in your prayers all right if you got your Bibles let's turn to the Book of Ruth and I told you a while back that I was studying on feet kind of funny but Claude and I were talking the other day and he said you know on Wednesday night he said you need to just kind of be just a little bit easy on the people and not be so hard because they're thinking about work and what they did at work and what they're going to do tomorrow at work he said so just give them something easy I said okay we're going to talk about feet today so and the title is how beautiful are the feet because the Bible completely talks about the feet and we're going to go go through you need to keep your Bible or you can keep watch up here because we're going to read about 14 or 15 different scriptures all the way through the Bible so let's bow our heads and speak to the author before we begin dear heavenly father we pray tonight that you would be here Lord as the active participant in this service you be the one that does the speaking father and you be the ones that do the do the hearing and the seeing and all the things Lord that we need for this service because without you lord it's just a meeting of of human beings and truly we do have a lot of things we are thinking about and work and stress and family and all these things but Lord let us lay that aside just for a little time and let us listen to you father we come here Lord for uh what we save some refueling in the middle of the week Lord to get carry us through to the weekend uh father we thank you Lord for this July the 4th coming up tomorrow truly Lord our independence day is individual as far as Christians but there is an Independence Day of a Nation Lord and we

tonight whatever the need may be Lord may you just meet that tonight father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes as we Endeavor to talk about you tonight in Jesus name we pray amen Ruth now in the Book of Ruth we see that she is come up here to chapter 3 and Naomi is telling her what to do and we see the type and what but watch the type because I just kind of want to show you where the start of of U of looking at Redemption because feet actually shows Redemption and we'll go back even Into the Book of Genesis Where Feet shows Redemption and this is by far uh put in feet footstep walk um soul of your all those things and you'll get probably 200 scriptures so we're just kind of gleaning the ones that we need right now and this is kind of a lengthy reading so I tell you what let's read let's read the first verse and then you can be seated and we'll just all read it together I know I know it's TI where everybody's tired and and uh and weary so let's read the first part and it shall be when he lith down now Naomi is telling her this because remember Ruth is a gentile right she does not know the customs of the Jews because her husband died at very young age so they didn't have time to to maybe Converse about what needed to be done actually while he was alive they didn't need the right of redemption he owned the land and Naomi and her husband and the sons they had the property but they all died and they all died to give us an example to show us that Israel has the right but when they lost that it went to Ruth but watch how it happens and it shall be when he lieth down verse four that thou shalt Mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do now you may be seated and let's just read the rest of it now watch how positive she is showing what she said and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do she's got an idea she knows that in the right of redemption in Israel that to claim what she had lost she had to find a nearer Kinsman amen all right so she found a near Kinsman she knew Boaz and actually here she's going to know she's going to know how he acts because she and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do now it's not Boaz telling Naomi which is telling Ruth right right it's Boaz is going to talk straight to Ruth amen all right so watch this and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me I will do look how obedient that's where you start The Obedience and she went down unto the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her and when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the Heap of corn now remember he was on the threshing floor and he came softly and and she came softly and uncovered his feet that's a safe place to lay down yeah come on she didn't lay down beside his body she laid down beside his feet amen all right submission all right and and and covered her feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered I am Ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman and he said blessed be thou the Lord my daughter for thou H has showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning Gentile in the latter end all right in as much as thou Fest not young men where the poor Rich and now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou thou request huh she hadn't said a word to him yet she hadn't said a word to him yet all right or required for all the city of my people doth know that thou are a virtuous woman that's what I was telling I was giving them a challenge when I was speaking in the past two churches the past two weekends I challenged the pastors I want you I want the uh we've been kind of passionate around between Brother Richard Roberts and myself and brother Anderson and brother Joe and brother Bob and uh there's a YouTube video of a Baptist Minister and I I'd like to show it he walks down where somebody's asleep he walks down and pushes their head up and he says wake up and he said oh you think he's going to leave the church and not come back he's not here to begin with then he walks about two floors back and he points at two people and he said I'm fixing to marry you to he said you two ain't been Church in 6 months said you ain't worth 15 cents then he points back at the video room and he says brother Cox he said me and you going to have a talk you need an attitude adjustment you're building a kingdom to yourself and me and you are going to have a talk about it and he said you know what if y'all want to vote me out I'll go find somebody that'll listen to this in other words he was saying I'm about finished it with these people anyway but anyway but you watch and see I I was telling the the pastors and the and the group and even being in our Sunday school class there with the Statue of a perfect man I kind of stayed on that with the U with the Sunday school class and over into brother dutches and brother claud's and I I challenged them I said look we have got it's a requirement that we have these virtues it's a requirement that we have these virtues but it's a requirement to get the people born again first if they're not born again it's about time to point at them and say you're not born again you're not acting right right amen come on if a Baptist preacher can walk out and tell the people ain't worth 15 cents and the big boy stood up and he went over and shook his hand and hugged his neck he said you know I love you and that's what he said to the people he said you know I love you he said I love your soul he said I'm that's what I'm here for I ain't worried about your body he said I'm here to save your soul and you know what I I he got a lot of amens but he he got a lot of Silence in some of the other but I've challenged the the ministers to to maybe focus more on the Statue of a perfect man because that's a requirement and that's a that's a stumbling block to others but it should be a a powerful thing that we use in our services in our daily life in our daily walk and when we come to church we don't have to worry about getting rid of all that stuff there's enough to get rid of anyway but that's what we're talking about today though Redemption how beautiful are the feet but let's continue and now is it true that I am thy near Kinsman cuz see right here watch the report in 311 watch the report for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman her walk compared with her talk amen all right and now is it true that I am thy near Kinsman how be it there's a Kinsman nearer than I now we knew who that was but what tarry or wait this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a Kinsman well let him do the Kinsman part but if he will not do the part of a Kinsman to thee then will I do the part of a Kinsman to thee as the Lord liveth lie down until the morning he didn't have a problem he didn't have a problem with a beautiful woman laying at his feet you know why she was a virtuous woman right she didn't have a a bad reputation when she walked in the church door right that's what I'm telling you about this feet feet walk our walk we're going to get into that and she'd lay at his feet until the morning she didn't have to get up right then and leave she laid there until the morning and she rose up before one could know another and said let it not be known that a woman came and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor also he said bring the veil that thou has upon thee and hold it he's not going to let let her go with nothing right he's going to give her something to sustain her until he does this right of redemption amen all right he's not going to leave her hungry he's going to feed her bring the veil that thou has upon the and hold it and when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the city all right we know what that was that was a sustainable amount that was the seal that was the six seals that that God has laid on us why cuz give it to a virtuous woman right right come on people I'm going to stay on this until y'all hate me or love me one of the two we have got to get our life straight amen and if not maybe we need to leave for a while just the way it is if a Baptist preacher can say it so can I cuz these virtues when they begin to work it weed out a lot right Peter James John yeah all those people sure Paul had a problem with a witch but one day God just nodded at him and he got rid of that witch right not calling anybody witch but God God will God will do just a little bit he's longsuffering but he'll cut it off when it's time to cut it off Paul turned around and rebuked her all right got it sorry and when she came to her mother-in-law said who art thou my daughter and she told her that the man had what the man had done to her and she said these six measures of barley gave he me for he said to me go not empty unto thy motherinlaw then said she sit still my daughter Ruth resting all right until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest right it's all laid on him now it's all laid on him there is nothing she can do it's all all laid on this man until he have finished until he have finished remember Jesus said on the cross he said it's finished amen the right of redemption he's finished all right it until he have finished a thing this day now let's go to Ruth 4 verse 7 because this is going to explain what he's going to do now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeem and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man plucked off his shoe right off his feet right and give it to his neighbor and this was a testimony in Israel other words they came out before the whole crowd neighbors and all therefore the Kinsman sent un to Boaz buy it for thee so he drew off his shoe and Boaz said unto the elders and to all the people ye are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was imich and all that was chalion and Marion melons of the hand of Naomi so here he comes and he shows the right of redemption he takes a shoe off of his foot and says I claim what is Naomi's all right to restore or to redeem back so there's your right of redemption so now in Genesis 3:15 let's show the first thing that God's going to do this is what he's going to show he said I'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel right at Calvary Satan bruised Jesus heel right there was the right of redemption God said I'm going to redeem from this you may bruise my heel but I'm going to crush your head right all right you can hit somebody in the foot and it won't kill them right hit somebody in the head it'll kill them so we see the Promise there but watch how we unfold this and see in Psalms 99 like I said we're going to just read a lot of scriptures tonight and the reason I'm hot I still got my cat on okay now look now we're going to look up this word because I have been looking at this and I know that we've read it many times but watch Psalms 995 says exalt thee Lord Our God and worship at his foot stol for he is Holy now I want you to watch how this is going to unfold and watch how this comes about this foot stol and watch where it came from all right exalt the Lord Our God and worship at his foot stool for he is Holy a Psalm of David the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol all right there's the foot he talking about the feet again now let's go to Isaiah 66 verse one thus sayith the Lord the heaven is my throne and the Earth is my foot stol so where is the right of redemption going to happen not in heaven amen it's going to happen on Earth there's got to be something of a possession on Earth not in heaven amen actually it's in Earth yeah not on Earth thus sayith the Lord the heaven is my throne and the Earth is my foot stol where is the house that you build unto me now what house is he talking about huh talking about brick and mortar you talking about a tabernacle he said a body thou has prepared me all right so here's you and I it's going to come down to where it's going to be our feet cuz Jesus's feet does not we read in Jeremiah not until the Millennium does his feet touch this Earth so where's the right of redemption going to come from Boaz if your feet are not standing on this earth right oh Boaz where are you Christ in you the hope of glory amen where is the house that you build me and where is the place of my rest for all those things hath mine hand made and all those things have made have been sayith the Lord but to this man will I look even to him that is poor and of a spirit and trembleth at my words brother Claude and I were talking the other day about uh repentance you know the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and that's our problem um you know we we say forgive me Lord or forgive me Lord forgive me Lord after about 45 times he quits listening yeah because the Bible said Godly sorrow leadth a man to repentance right Godly sorrow you you got to really be sorry for it you got to really be sorry for it amen then God will forgive you but just say to forgive me Lord that's just vain jangling right all right now let's go to Hebrews 10 cuz I wanted to see how this evolved brother dick always enjoyed Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot foot stool and and I always wanted to know where that foot stool came from well I kind of see it as a metaphor being down here and God putting his feet on the earth Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol but really with with looking at Footprints and looking at feet being talking about Redemption we see that that foot St I want you to watch what happens here because they explain it in the Greek Lexicon but then it gives you a scripture for it cuz it goes all the way back into the Old Testament Hebrews 10: 12 says but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sin forever sat down on the right hand of God now who's he talking about Jesus Christ the man that does the right of redemption right from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot stol for by one offering he ha perfected forever them that are Sanctified now let's go to the Greek Lexicon and look up that word foot stool the word foot stool is hod but watch what it says to make one a foot stol of one's feet I.E the subject to reduce under one's power a metaphor taken from the practice of conquerors who plac their feet on the necks of their conquered enemies yeah what did David do jumps up on Goliath's neck right takes his sword out steps on his neck cuts his head off but watch here it happened in Joshua also in the Book of Joshua 10: 24 and it came to pass when they brought out the Kings those kings under Joshua that Joshua called for all the men of Israel and said unto the captains of the men of War which went with him come near put your feet put your feet right exactly not Joshua's feet Joshua type of the Holy Ghost he said you put your feet right you put your feet upon the necks of these Kings in other words you're the one that fought the Battle right cuz it was the captains of the men of war and they came near and put their feet upon the necks of them right and Joshua said fear not nor be dismayed be strong and of good courage for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies against whom you fight right there's your foot stol putting your foot on the enemy what's The Last Enemy to be destroyed death all right but you know what it doesn't differentiate and make death something more than this no says you stay there until you make the enemies your foot stol you stay right there and then The Last Enemy to be destroyed is death all right let's go right here for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies against whom ye fight so Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol you say well what's that got to do with it there's your right of redemption because you got to redeem the land what happened Joshua went in to what possess the land that was supposed to been his it was supposed to been Israel's to start with right he told them to go get it 40 something years before then right 40 something years he said this is your land right go in and possess it but it took the Holy Ghost Joshua to step up and say hey this is what you're going to do to your enemy and not one of them going to be able to stand against you what a mighty God we serve yes Lord now let's look at at a few scriptures here CU I want to set something up to get into Isaiah but Psalms 26:12 says my foot standeth in an even place in the congregation will I bless the Lord Jeremiah 12:10 says listen to this many pastors have destroyed my Vineyards that says pastors right not pastures pastors right so many pastors have destroyed my Vineyard they have tried my portion Under Foot what their foot not the right of redemption not the foot of redemption but under their foot they have made my Pleasant portion a desolate Wilderness all right now look in the Book of Revelations we're going to carry it through and then step back CU I want to make a point here in the book of Isaiah Revelations 1:13 says in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like un to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot all the way down it didn't come to the knees he went all the way to the foot full Redemption when he was standing in the Book of Revelations 13 there was full Redemption all right and G about the PS with a golden girdle so that's you and I right that's bride form right so it's garment down to the down to the foot amen this garment's got to cover all the way to the foot all right cuz you got to get down to the feet to get the Redemption amen kind of easy kind of simple but you know what maybe if you'll think about feet cuz when we get to the end of this thing something we do all the time and Jesus was telling them what he was going to do and they didn't have a clue they didn't have a clue all right so watch but look in Revelations 10:2 and he had in his hand a little book open and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth what's he coming back to do right Redemption that's not in heaven right he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth he's down here this is where Redemption is going to take place we know it was 2,000 years ago in the mind of God we know that but it's got to come physical here all right because what it was lost down here and this is where it's got to be redeemed all right so now let's look at Isaiah because look Isaiah 52:7 ver8 7 and 8 we know that comes to maybe to preachers or because we're going to read two in Romans 10 cuz it it kind of expounds on that but in Isaiah 52:7 it's like I've always said this is not just to the preachers how beautiful are your feet how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him the feet why is it why is it keep talking about the feet feet and Mountain you know what all Caleb wanted he didn't have no inheritance the tribe of Judah got something else Caleb was standing there and Joshua said what do you want there's nothing else to give he said I've had my eye on that mountain right there I've had my eye on that mountain cuz remember Caleb tipes the Gentile do you know actually the word Caleb means dog the word Caleb means dog when Jesus was sitting there and that saraph phenician woman said Lord remember he said I not going to give this to the dogs what the Gentiles so we see Caleb means dog but that dog got a mountain yeah that dog got a mountain that dog didn't it wasn't left alone he got a mountain but look how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publish peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publish salvation that saith unto Z thy God reth that's your part also it's not just Mountains for preachers it's Mountain for leoty this is your statue of a perfect man this is your inheritance you can either accept it or reject it the man that was in the prison he rejected it right right he rejected it so you have what I was trying to tell him brother Brown said the Holy Ghost was very timid a gentleman so he's not going to make you have these virtues you're not going to sit here and just say God you're going to have to give them to me now you know what happened Caleb said give me that mountain but if you'll keep reading the scripture Caleb had to fight the IES to get that mountain it wasn't a Cate walk he had to go and drive three different kind of people off that mountain but you know what he did it and he stayed on that mountain cuz you know what that's what he wanted and you know what God Said God said because Caleb holy w h o l l y holy didn't miss a virtue amen holy followed me I'll give him what he wants that's what our problem is why we not getting what we want because we don't wholly possess a mountain w h o l l y the whole Mountain all right it is a Holy Mountain but we got to possess it thy Watchmen shall lift up the voice with the voice together shall they sing for they shall see eye to eye right that's kind of hard for preachers to do well you know I've heard it said that you know we never come to a conclusion at the ministers meeting I I think the Bible says pretty plain we supposed to see eye to eye and that's not one eye this way and one out of that way or one going in this direction or crossed we've seen a few crossed but for they shall see eye to eye what when the Lord shall bring again Zion which is who the bride when he shall bring us in we will see this right of redemption it's a challenge how beautiful on the mountain are the feet we're going to read a quote in just a few minutes where brother Brown says Footprints means possession you can't just say Caleb just didn't say give me that mountain and he went to Florida that's just an area you know he didn't say give me my mountain and go to Egypt he went and got the mountain okay so that's what you that's my challenge to all of us that mountain is ours and we're letting it sit there empty or we're letting it sit there with all these IES in it I ain't going to do this told him last Sunday the Bible said I'll give you a new heart and it'll be a heart of Flesh I'll take out the Stony heart because you can't use a Stony heart a Stony heart is not pliable right a Stony heart if you put a heart in you that's made with stone you'll die but you put in a heart of Flesh that's what it's supposed to be something that's pliable something that God can work with all right and that's my goal is to get some you know hate me if you want to I don't care I'm like the old man I'm after your soul right and if you think you're something and you're not somebody ought to tell you may just be me Romans 10:14 cuz watch now Paul is going to remember Paul gets everything from the Old Testament right right exactly Paul goes and studies the Old Testament gets gleans out of the Old Testament and writes the New Testament okay so now Romans 10:14 how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard right and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach preach except they be sent he continues on here amen as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace Paul goes right back to the book of Isaiah we just read how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things so we come and we see that Paul has brought us away pastors right apostles prophets pastors teachers evangelists that's the only way you're going to get perfected not this is not one man show right you're going to get perfected by five folds all right and those five folds if they're true they will help you if not they're going to be just like that was over there where it says my pastors many pastors have destroyed my Vineyard they have trotten my portion underfoot in other words under the wrong foot not going to say anymore we may speak on that later on let's go to Matthew and let's see how let's see how bad it is to turn a preacher down now I've heard many of you I sorry we're going to get personal tonight I've heard many of you say oh that was just brother Wade you know you could be blasphemed in the Holy Ghost you know if a deacon tells you something you say well I'm going to go do this just get get the deacons off my back you know that's almost blaspheming the Holy Ghost could be cuz what is blaspheming the Holy Ghost contributing something to be of the devil when it's of God is that right y'all about as quiet as that Baptist Church the other night but think about it if somebody tells you and it's in the word of God I don't care if he's mad or not but if he tells you the word of God and you're doing it wrong and you won't take correction and you say oh that's just brother so and so how many times have we said that I've heard some of you say I'm going going to do this just to get the deacons off my back that's almost blaspheming the Holy Ghost you say I can't do that you ain't born again you can and if you're not born that's probably why why you saying it cuz you're not born again let's just be honest let's just be honest with each other now look and if the house be worthy now what happens let's back up what happens is Jesus has got his disciples right he's going to take them two by two and send them out into the into the community okay all right let's set a stage here he's going to send them out into the community look how serious this is now God sends these people now they don't have the Holy Ghost yet but they're preaching what God tells them to preach because the Holy Ghost has not come but watch he sends them out two by two he says if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it if your look at me house he ain't talking about bricks and Stone House if your house be worthy if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you and whosoever shall not receive you look how serious this is nor hear your words when you depart out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feet they have stopped the right of redemption amen if we're talking about feet means Redemption right why did Jesus say why' he say something about feet why is feet always coming up here whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your word when ye depart out of that house or city or church shake off the dust of your feet verily I say unto you it shall be more tolerable I'm not saying this this is a actually this is red letter Jesus is saying this it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that person right or that City whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words when you depart shake off the dust of your feet because you they turn the right of redemption down you turn the right of redemption down there's nothing left but destruction all right pretty serious business but you turn down What God Says and look what happens right okay now talking about Redemption what happened in the book Book of Daniel just for a little thought here cuz I've only got a few more left that I want to use tonight I may want to continue with part two later on but in the Book of Daniel where does the image get struck not in the head from what the stone right not made by hands amen which was who Jesus Christ to do the right of redemption he goes right to the feet and he destroys that Kingdom that turns him down that image cuz you make an image other than God and you you've turned God down all right listen let's read Daniel now Daniel 2 and verse 33 through 35 his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay now look how weak that foot is right if that foot would have been all Iron been hard to bust if it would have been all gold but remember man puts the finery up here gold was the head right and then it goes down brass and all that when you get down to the feet it's so weak iron and Clay don't even you can't even put it together hardly right so the feet of the enemy is so weak that stone is going to come and watch what happens that thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smoke the image upon his feet Christ coming doing the right of redemption strikes Satan watch that were of iron and clay and break them to Pieces didn't just break them to Pieces brother Chris didn't just leave them on the side of the road watch what happened then was the iron the clay he took the whole image cuz when he struck it in the feet it fell right all right he didn't just take the iron and Clay the brass the silver and the gold broke into pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floor he ground that image so into the ground till it was just like sand probably was less than sand and that's what he's going to do to the devil but look the wind carried them away that no place was found for them right Naomi had had to have had a piece of land she had to have a piece of land before Boaz could redeem it right amen she possessed that property but she lost it she lost it but Boaz come to redeem it back right now let's go well let's read the rest of this and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the SM stone that smoked the image became a what amen we go right back to a mountain again it's like I told him before did you ever think of this when I was preaching that the other day on on um what was I preaching on the other day J um but anyway oh glorify it again Jesus started on a river and ended on a mountain your experience starts at a river and ends at a mountain amen you do the same thing Jesus did when he was on the River Jordan he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell and he goes to a mountain at the end of his journey and God makes him before man he says you're going to hear this guy right here right why because he was obedient his walk was obedient if you're disobedient remember probably not a son but now let's go to Zechariah 14 and this is is where he's going to stand then we're going to read a couple of quotes I think here in just a minute that brother brandham talks about here but Zechariah 144 and his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives this is when it's done for us remember all right which is before Jerusalem on the East and the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the East and toward the west and there shall be a very great valley and half of the mountain shall remove toward the North and half of it toward the South that's when Jesus is coming back Zechariah showing that his feet shall stand where upon the Earth the only way Jesus's feet is going to be on the earth at that time is is the right of redemption has been claimed in a group of people one more time amen one more time right the only reason he's standing in on the earth at that moment of time is that somebody has come to full Redemption somebody has let Boaz right remember Ruth didn't have anything to do right amen she let Boaz do the work for him like brother Dale said that's what kind of struck this with me the other day when he said when he gave the quote where said God let it die yeah you know what if you kill somebody You're a murderer right but God says I put in Kings and take out Kings All Souls are mine he said don't he said don't worry about the one that can kill the body he should worry about the one that can kill the soul God's the only one that can make one and take one away so we have to let God kill that thing we have to let God let it die as the prophet said all right if God lets it die the the old man ain't going to resurrect no more all right so his feet shall stand that day on the Mount of Olives now watch let's go back to Deuteronomy and let's look at possession because what's going to happen here in the book of Deuteronomy we're going to go back to the walk because your walk is going to determine what you get one more time your walk is going to determine what you get all right now what's he talking he's talking to who Moses right he's talking to Moses here in Deuteronomy all right then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you and you shall possess greater Nations and mightier than yourself every place where on the souls of your feet shall tread shall be yours right from the Wilderness and Lebanon from the river the river Euphrates even un the uttermost sea shall your Coast be so everywhere they went that was a possession there shall no man be able to stand before you stand right feet right but it's the other guy's feet yeah no man will be able to stand before you why you going to knock them all down for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you if you have these virtues in place can I read the love letter is that okay brother Dean can I read the love letter I know you love to do that read that love letter God's talking to us right that's the Love Letter sure it's Israel and sure it's Moses but let's take it out of the Old Testament and put it right here tonight amen God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread walk upon as he hath said unto you but your walk being something cuz put up 15a and let's read this one I didn't have this one in CU it it kind of says a little bit different but go back to 15a I think I missed that one but that look watch in Psalms 37 now brother brandom quotes this scripture and he don't quoted anything close to that brother brandom quotes the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord now that's not exactly what that says but that's exactly what that says right because you pull up the quote footsteps of the righteous you hear Brother Ram quoted about 80 something times in the sermon well there's no scripture that says to the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord but I looked up ordered by the or ordered of the Lord and I just put ordered in and this is what comes up and that's the only scripture he's talking about but the steps of a good man right a good man see the problem is that good part the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way so now there shall no man be able to stand before you get the steps of a good man ordered by the Lord Glory all right now let's read this great warrior Joshua 1955 119 all right let's read on down where down here for the the dark part is he told Joshua he said as I was with Moses so I will be with thee only be good be good only be good courage courageous do not be discourage just keep moving on I'll be with you every place you set the souls of your feet is a possession for you right right Glory now look he didn't stop there Footprints means possession brother what the church needs tonight is some more Footprints over here on this land don't hang around Jordan too long let's get out of here and see what we got all right every time that he made a footprint every time he footprinted on it was a possession I can see Joshua after he had the vision he said now gather all Israel together I'll show you the glory of God is amen he had a vision God told him in his word Glory he's talking to us God told him in his word the word says I've give you the land it's yours it's your possession all right now sir we will see Jesus 1957 Brothers Footprints is possession ministering Brethren don't be afraid to put print Footprints where God has told you to go right not where Mama sent you or where you think you ought to go but where God Amen told you to go amen it's possession he told Joshua everywhere The Souls of your feet set that's yours amen we don't back up we take what God Said and that's the truth no matter what the opposition is how great it seems how difficult it seems if God said so it's yours when he gave it to Joshua he never said I'll take all the high fight and Philistines and give it to you Joshua had to fight for every inch of ground but God was with him and every inch of ground you'll cover brother to make Footprints you'll fight your way through right but take the sword of the spirit brother and move right on Footprints is possession so what did he tell let's go back to the father of our faith let's go back to Abraham that's why Abraham was a Sojourner that's why Abraham went into Canaan he even went into Egypt he went he walked all over that property why Genesis 13:16 and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise walk right Footprints walk through the land in the length of it and the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee amen all right you see where this is all coming to but now watch there's something that we do and we'll be finished in just a minute won't be long tonight just kind of wanted to give you a few scriptures tonight and then maybe we'll do something a little bit later on for more on Footprints and possession but let's turn to John 134 you ever wonder why Jesus instituted footwash question oh because they had Dirty Feet no you ever really listen to what it says or is it just become a ritual that we do at the end of the communion if Footprints means possession and feet has a part of redemption let's read and see what he says he rises from sumper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel and GED him self and after that he pth water into a bason and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel where with he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know here after in other words when he the Holy Ghost has come he'll tell you why when you you're washing the brother's feet you're showing the right of redemption amen listen what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet watch what Jesus said Jesus answered him if I wash thee not don't tell me that's not important I know a lot of you don't take communion but don't take footb foot washing you're losing your right of redemption right sorry guys he don't Institute this and then you you can do it if you want to now if you got a problem with your feet that's okay you need to tell somebody though but if you take communion I wouldn't take communion if I didn't foot wash knowing now what I know about this right here about this foot washing showing the right of redemption that Jesus is saying what I do thou knowest not now but you'll know Hereafter if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me amen now I didn't say that it's not a rule that I put in the book Jesus said if I don't wash your feet you have no part with me in other words what the right of redemption if you refuse you refuse that part of redemption hey that's Jesus left us three things to do right communion water baptism washing feet that's all not a list of 80 or 70 or 50 three three things to do and he said if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me now Simon Peter was a pretty dumb guy as far as ignorant and unlearned but he was smart when it come to this right Simon Peter said' Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my and my head but now remember the hands and the head ain't got anything to do with the right of redemption Jesus was showing them the right of redemption he's coming to redeem them body because he didn't wash their theophany right he washed their feet they were human feet and those same feet that Peter he washed Peter's feet the same reason that Peter let him do it and got a revelation of it the same reason that Peter's going to stand back on this Earth again cuz he's going to accept the right of redemption right all right same way with you and I all right if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said to him he that is washed he's talking about natural he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean ever with but ye are not all clean for he knew who should betray him therefore he said ye are not all clean you know I was brother Claud and I were talking about something the other day and he said you know what he said Jesus didn't refuse Judas in anything let him take communion even let him take foot washing but you know what that was his condemnation cuz when he finished washing judas's feet Judas left he stayed until he come to that right of redemption Jesus washed his feet as a symbol but he turned it down he went out he didn't stay with him he went out so after he had washed their feet and had taken His Garment and was set down he said unto them know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet right for I have given you an example an example that you should do as I have have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you the very thing that we walk on this Earth with called feet everywhere you go you're possession the land amen Footprints means possession right now apply that to your children apply that to your home right apply that to your car apply that to your job I think the problem is is we just don't believe we don't believe if you're born again those feet you're walking on Are Holy feet but I now the Lord never said but I the Lord told Moses go in and possess the told Joshua go in and possess the land wherever The Souls of your feet stand I'll give it to you so you know what if Joshua walked out to the east God give him everything to the East and then God has give us the Holy Ghost now Joshua and a type of the Holy Ghost and not just to guide us outside but inside brother Brown said these are God these are God's hand right so these are God's feet but remember where you walk I like what Claud says if you live a hound dog life that means you're a hound dog and the seal show on the back side and the front side that means coming and going out there and out here right how many of us I want I'd like for Daddy to ride with us sometime just to just to kind of enjoy um me and Jacob kidding each other a lot but and talking about his daddy but um I'm sorry his mama talking about his mama that's right talking about his mama now Jacob's a good kid I enjoy working with him but can you do that could you let your pastor go with you all day at work and not be ashamed and not be ashamed of one thing not one not a slip up oh oh sorry no one thing could you how about two or three days three or four days but you know what God's with you 24/7 right the one that you say is your father right cuz you're walking brother BR said you're a walking living breathing instrumentality of God I read that to the people in Oklahoma and then I also read the one in invisible Union where you The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ that's what he said that's what he said but you got to come under that Jesus has got to wash your feet and then you got to wash the others feet that was judas's problem Judas never made it to another foot washing I didn't finish my story Judas didn't make it to another foot washing he hung himself but the disciples after Jesus came back and the baptism of the Holy Ghost they continued to wash feet they would gather together they would wash feet why they was doing exactly what Jesus said wash wash the disciples feet wash the feet of the ones that possess the land but you and I have a possession right and it's not in cars and homes and all that's fine but it's in you it's in flesh that's why this how beautiful are the feet now God said that how beautiful are the feet of them that carry the gospel not just a preacher you're supposed to carry the gospel it's not just our it's not the burden is not all on us it say study to show yourself approved don't study to show your pastor approved right study to show yourself approved right a Workman what does a Workman do sit down no he works he's on his feet he's walking he's possessing the land that's our problem people we need to start putting our feet to the neck of that enemy ain't that what David said Joshua said and then David did it with with Goliath but Joshua said hey you come in here you put your feet on those kings you know there was a man named Samuel one time let's stand there was a man named Samuel not going to be here long tonight I just want to let you just every time you read the Bible now you're going to look at feet and foot foot stool Footprints walk heal uh all kind of things but remember there is your right of redemption so watch that and look for it in the scripture but you know how beautiful are the feet God said beautiful right are the feet of them that bring great Tidings amen of Joy to the people we you know we need missionaries and we need things like that but Claud and I were talking the other day you know brother Bram said first and foremost that the United States of America is where we need to be missionary first right first and foremost missionary here have you talked to your neighbor or does you life speak louder than your testimony and it drowns out your neighbor's thoughts of you daddy said many times and I don't y'all don't listen I don't either sometimes he says maybe your kids don't want this because they don't see it in you well who's he talking to that church over under who's he talking about who's he talking to me too brother but we just don't admit it our problem is repent that's our whole problem we say sorry Lord no the Bible says Godly sorrow leadeth you to repentance you got to be sorrow for for what you're doing then repent and then God said he'd do what he'd do there's a step in a process for all this but remember feet everywhere you go everywhere the soul of your feet and you know what my kids's feet are mine right they come from me my kids's feet are mine that's where they come from they come from me same way with yours your kids didn't come from somebody else they came from your feet Footprints means possession right so walk everywhere you walk make sure that your testimony fits with your walk let's bow our heads then we'll sing a song dear heavenly father we pray that what we've said tonight would go to the heart of the people and they would see Lord that we have a lot of work to do we see the apostles and see how they walked in there in the book of Acts and how the actions of the Holy Ghost in the Believers just makes us ashamed of oursel Lord but Lord if we could just see that it's not us doing it but Lord we do have to press into a place you said the Kingdom of Heaven is taken by force so Lord let us Force our way take these feet that you've given us Lord your feet Shaw with the preparation of the Gospel we didn't get to that one but Lord there's many others that will take at a later time if you'll permit Lord but our feet are shod with the preparation of the Gospel so we must prepare before we walk we must prepare before we fight cuz we can't fight this enemy by oursel we have to have a Joshua who will go out and possess every where the soul of his feet was you gave it to him and Lord I pray that you would take us as you took Gideon who was hiding behind a well and you look down at Gideon said Gideon thy Mighty Man of Valor he'd never fought a fight he was afraid of where he was he was afraid of the enemy he had let him beat him down but you said Gideon thy Mighty Man of Valor Lord you knew what he was made out of but he didn't but now we see that Gideon through a revelation saw that you were the one that was doing the work and that you were using that vessel Lord we pray that you'd use all these vessels but we must empty oursel up first so that you can possess this vessel father we ask that You' just be with us now in the rest of this service Lord May our thoughts and ideas be thrown out the window Lord and we'll have the mind of Christ and that that mind that's formed in US Lord will take out all that old man that old nature and kill that thing out Lord if we have a door as the prophet said IND doors IND doors we may have a door of Pride we may have a door of selfishness we may have a door of of being dilatory or or being slothful or or not be wanting to to do the things that we're supposed to do Lord may we open that door Lord you're a gentleman you won't come crashing through the door you'll ask if you can come in and we can tell you yes or no father we pray that we open all doors all of our life would be an open book to you father that we will truly Lord as we spoke last weekend on the book of books that we would absolutely be that book that people will be judged from that you Lord will be happy and pleased to dwell in this vessel Lord for those that do not have the Holy Ghost I pray Lord that you'd give it to them right now that they would not settle their self day or night that they wouldn't eat Lord just stir their water father go after our children go after our husbands and wives that are not here Lord go after brothers and sisters and the ones Lord that are downstairs on that list Lord we pray that you would just be with them that you would tug at their heart Lord and that they would accept you father the ones that have left the church Lord many many times we see them drifting back in and drifting back out Lord we pray that you would bring them in the F father it's getting late it's getting a time to where we don't need to be playing anymore Lord we need to show that when we wash our brother's feet we're not just washing just for some kind of a um a ritual but it's lord it's showing that you did the right of redemption in that person and that you're having that foot washing and communion to show Lord that you've cleansed Us by the washing of the water of the word that you've took all of our sin and our shame and put it on your back and went to Calvary with it Lord and they nailed those beautiful feet to the cross for my sins Lord and when you came up on Resurrection morning you didn't have sore feet but you still had those nail prints but Lord those feet possess the gates of the enemy and they tore hell they tore death and sent them back to where they supposed to be Lord we've got to understand that we've got to see that and it's got to start somewhere so Lord start it right here start it in me Lord start it in Lord each one in this building tonight that we would be Lord not so so much as as take a drink of water without asking you Lord as as Stonewall Jackson Lord would wouldn't even put a water to his mouth without saying Thank You Lord we thank you for all things father maybe this little sermon has been something that'll that'll help somebody that'll that'll show them that that Lord you're not doing it in heaven that you came down and put your foot on one on land and one on sea and that you had that Mighty book in your hand you are that Mighty Angel and that book is me Lord so you come down lord to possess this property Satan you have just but a few moments left to be a squatter on this piece of property but God made this Earth to be inhabited by his children and his children are the only on that's going to inhabit this land the only one that's going to possess this land Lord we pray that you would just help us to realize that and to have our foot at the throat of the enemy Lord and take that sword of the word and cut him yes Lord and get rid of all these old things that we've got hanging on us Lord Lord you had a Church in the book of Ephesus there was all of 12 people father with as many as we have in this building we are to be a mightier church more than 12 sometimes 8 times 12 but Lord we got to be a moving breathing instrumentality for you first we got to get oursel lined up with the word and father I pray that you'd start right here tonight that you give us a blessing that we can't contain Lord we don't have to ask you to come Among Us you're already here father we pray now that you would just touch us lead us and guide us by the Holy Spirit be with all of us tomorrow as we take a little time off there to to celebrate Independence Day Lord to let our independence start tonight Lord let it start this evening Lord let it start a day early that we see that our feet were put on this Earth to possess this land and I pray Lord that you would Quicken it to the people's hearts we love you we praise you we adore you in Jesus name amen what we got sing a song I bless your name 48 in the black book 148 in the black book Let's sing in prison chain with bleeding stri Paul and let's pray that night they had a power behind their prayer you know why they were desperate they were in a jail you ever been in jail well if you ever been in jail I've never been in jail either but I bet it's tough they were free I bless your name I bless your name how many love him tonight let's give him honor and praise I give you praise you are the the truth the way I bless your name I bless your name listen to this some Midnight Hour if you should find you're in a PR in your mind reach out and pray just reach out sometime he's right there and they will fall use that name Jesus name I bless your name I bless your name I give you all give you praise you are the light the truth the way I bless your name I bless your name we bless your name PR for Jonathan Ashley they know where they you are give you give you praise you are you you are you are alive I give you you are out you praise you are the light the truth the way I bless your name I bless your name you know what if Joshua would have looked and listen remember the sermon I preached about 10 lion preachers 10 lion preachers come back with an ill report right they were preachers they were sent to do a job and come back and bring a report who has believed our report and who has the arm of the Lord been revealed well Joshua and Caleb they didn't see they didn't see all that how tall they were and how many they were and they said we can take the land just like Abraham Abraham how you going to have that baby he said I don't have a clue in other words what he was saying was it's not my job to do it God want it promised it that's what we got to look at you look look at the promise you forget about the journey you'll go crazy worrying about your kids and your wife and your people and you'll go crazy and that's what the devil wants you to do go crazy that's right Abraham didn't go crazy he was 99 years old he physically knew in his body he could not do that but yet he sat down I believe every night and said God you promised God you promised I'd have a child and I believe he just looked at God and said you're the only one that can do it you're the only one that can perform it now how we going to change our body somebody tell me somebody give me a formula tell me what somebody just kind of figured out go Google it Google change of the body take something yeah exactly you can't do it by I always thought you had to be strong and you know great big muscles and all this Jesus said what man can add one inch to his stature but God told us promises and if Footprints means possession you walk in front of your kids you walk in front of your wife or your or your spouse that's not here and that's all you can do but now you make sure it reflects with this if it don't reflect with this that's probably the reason that why they're not here here's the mirror right look in this mirror this mirror right here tell you how to act right you look in a regular mirror see Abraham looked in a regular mirror and he knew he couldn't perform Hey listen Abraham knew what it took to have a kid he wasn't a dummy he was not 99 years old and been living with Sarah since she was 16 so he knew all the mechanics we sometimes know all the mechanics but where's the Dynamics one day the Dynamics came and changed Abraham's body cuz there's no way Abraham could do that so let's don't sit here and try to figure out how this thing's going to end let's don't figure out try to figure out this and that and the other well brother brandham what's this change of the body or this translation he said just a change he never expounded much more on it he say just a change you know why cuz it wasn't for him to figure out right it wasn't for him to figure it out it ain't for us to figure out we set down and figure out try to figure out what God wants this is what he wants he got say no more this is it right here the mirror the reflection look in and see but Footprints means possession how beautiful are the feet that's what God said about you when he come to the River Jordan and he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell God was pleased to dwell in that vessel right no other stipulation sure he had flesh he probably needed a bath but God was pleased to dwell in that vessel and he took that vessel and it died for me and you those precious beautiful feet do you know we're going to walk on streets of gold with feet with no scars and it's going to feel just like good soft grass man I love to walk on Daddy's yard I take my shoes off and just walk cuz it's just be but now what about 10 million times more than that over there cuz you might step in something his in his yard Thorns or briers or I'm talking about thorns and briers y'all quit talking about other stuff thorns and briers and rocks but over there it's just streets to go but you know what when Jesus walks up you're going to look down at those feet and they're going to be the most beautiful feet in the world and they going to have holes down through the top of them for me and you brother Ry for an eternity he's going to have a body that's going to walk on those feet because he possessed you you were lost you were doomed and on your way to hell and he came and died we're going to get back one day to start believing that Jesus Christ died for us and then we'll start worrying about what the message said okay let's get let's get them let's get them to Christ the prophet said and I'll promise you you get them to Christ they'll come to the message I promise you you get them to Christ get them to Christ they'll come to the message but you got to you you know you know what they're watching your feet right everywhere you go they're watching somebody's watching you know they got cameras everywhere Now everywhere even where you don't even think there's cameras we were doing a house today and Jacob said look up and I looked up in a tree and there was a camera never seen it before it's a camera sticking up in a tree surveillance camera but you know what God's watching you but people around you are watching in you too amen whether you realize it or not they're watching and you know what God said he's going to possess this land and I'm talking about this land this land right here by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he has possessed the gates of the enemy I remember Brother Dean lik to uh really likes to preach on possessing the gates of the enemy CU you know what it is this is the enemies this right here is the enemies it was born in sin shapen in iniquity spouse of Mother's wom a liar doomed and on his way to hell but Jesus Christ possessed this right here you'll think about foot washing a little bit different I hope even you sisters also you'll think about foot washing cuz you're washing the feet showing that the right of redemption has been fulfilled eat my flesh drink my blood wash your feet that's what he said to do till he come right so maybe maybe we'll understand it a little bit more when we wash our brother's feet are you washing your sister's feet you're washing their feet showing hey you can be redeemed this is the right of redemption cuz Jesus said you'll understand it let me paraphrase he said you'll understand it when I come back you're not going to understand it now right but you'll understand it so I believe the first time they took foot washing after they received the Holy Ghost I believe they had a good time they probably didn't stay sit down long they probably them feet was up jumping aisles and all these other things cuz they had realized what Jesus was trying to tell them I am doing the right of redemption and now I'm telling you to go do the same thing right the same thing not something different the only way people are going to be redeemed on this Earth is to hear the gospel through us and I don't mean us I mean the bride right that's the right of redemption how beautiful are the feet let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we pray Lord that you'd give us a safe trip back home Lord that you forgive us of our sins Lord and our many mistakes that we make Lord we look to Calvary Lord we look to the blood and you hear our Voice through the blood and you don't see all the little stupid things that we do Lord but I pray Lord that as we walk in our daily life that you would be the total possessor of these vessels that you would show people through our lives that they can be redeemed and we look to you at Calvary Lord knowing that you did that right but you
