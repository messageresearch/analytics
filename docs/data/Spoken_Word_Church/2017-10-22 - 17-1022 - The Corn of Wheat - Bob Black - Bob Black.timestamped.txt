[0:08] all right so I'm gonna look at this
[0:10] little topic of the corner of week and I
[0:13] I just pray the Lord help me cuz I've
[0:15] got a list of slides to go through the
[0:20] week 3 well I want to slow down and take
[0:27] my time I think everybody can get a good
[0:40] handle on what you talking uh so anyway
[0:42] I want to talk about this little topic
[0:45] and the reason this is this you don't
[0:47] have enough is nothing you don't have
[0:50] you microphone oh well this table some
[0:56] errors no you're fine no there's no no
[1:02] there no you just lucky over there but
[1:15] you got to put the microphone on you
[1:16] don't have the microphone oh that right
[1:20] there right over here
[1:29] meet this on video I got the very first
[1:40] look when this man this thing is
[1:58] everything all right
[2:33] let me tell let me get my mind back on
[2:34] what we talked
[2:35] the corner we and and am I able to do it
[2:45] take out that first little section these
[2:49] good is that and now so the reason the
[2:55] corner wind is important is because you
[2:57] know
[2:59] [Music]
[3:03] there's a there's an alpha L Omega word
[3:06] and what's what is that in the last day
[3:09] without eyes grow in the church - yes
[3:11] he's growing us back to what was planted
[3:14] in the beginning and so that's why it's
[3:17] important to have an understanding of
[3:18] what that original corn of wheat looked
[3:21] like what its attributes and what is
[3:23] makeup and all the things about it word
[3:26] because the bride is I believe is now
[3:28] coming to a revelation of who she is and
[3:31] what has been taken place all down to
[3:33] the cemetery and the process of maturing
[3:37] so that the original word is made
[3:40] manifest back in the bride free back
[3:43] into the wheat land again so that it
[3:46] looks exactly like it did in the
[3:48] beginning
[3:48] not one word off that's kind of a big a
[3:52] big statement not one word off and I
[3:54] because because you know that's really
[3:56] what what started the whole problem in
[3:58] the beginning was Satan injected esteem
[4:00] you know to keep God's plan and purpose
[4:03] from being made manifest
[4:04] he injected it to one just one word off
[4:07] and all it took to stop the plaintiff to
[4:10] come block up the flus and unsafe Tetra
[4:12] to block up the flus and that's what's
[4:14] keeping God's Word from being made
[4:17] manifest in our life today he is a Satan
[4:20] wore injectable scheme to keep you from
[4:24] believing the full Word of God
[4:26] he'll inject doctrines you and Jake
[4:29] ideas in your head so that you say well
[4:32] I know I believe it but it
[4:34] it's not for me it's not this this is
[4:35] not something that I can take ahold of
[4:39] and he'll inject all these things to
[4:41] keep his word from being made manifest
[4:43] in your life and what's really
[4:47] interesting is even even when that juror
[4:50] maybe you can see that this is something
[4:52] I got off of like a nature website where
[4:55] they're talking about the developmental
[4:56] stages of a week early even when that
[4:58] week kernel begins to grow only in the
[5:00] shook their stages of maturity that has
[5:03] to come through look at look at what
[5:05] these things are the water stays the
[5:07] milk stage milk to ripen from milk and
[5:12] desire the sincere milk of the word all
[5:15] the way to where it's right and it's
[5:17] dead to itself it's ready to produce
[5:20] something you know when this isn't just
[5:22] like like we'll say let's let's go to
[5:24] the Bible types not just the letter on
[5:27] the page the letter of the just just
[5:29] like a unclick and word this is
[5:32] something that if you put it in the
[5:33] ground it will produce again it's got
[5:37] life in it so that's kind of what I'm
[5:41] gonna be talking about today is that
[5:42] when when God annoys the word it will
[5:46] produce something it's gotta be the
[5:50] words gotta be preached it has got to be
[5:53] delivered you gotta have the truth but
[5:55] then you also have to have the spirit
[5:57] with it because you can have you can
[5:59] have one without the other you can have
[6:01] the letter the intellectual letter yeah
[6:03] and not quick and then you just have it
[6:05] in your head and you just start thinking
[6:07] your biggest shot and you become
[6:09] somebody big and everything you can also
[6:11] have just the spirit without the letter
[6:14] and it's fall in it there's nothing
[6:16] there for it to quicken and so you have
[6:17] you know you can maybe cast out Devils
[6:20] and things and and and speak in tongues
[6:22] but the word is not there but if you get
[6:25] them both together then the anointed
[6:28] word will produce exactly what it's
[6:31] supposed to do Amen so I
[6:36] I kind of just been meditating on how
[6:39] important it is to get the word out
[6:42] there to preach the word and you know
[6:45] sometimes like I start you know thinking
[6:48] about things people that I've talked to
[6:50] things that I've heard and you know it
[6:53] you know brother out there's a quote
[6:55] where he said ministers are critical
[6:59] because that's the way that they are
[7:02] they're looking at the situation and it
[7:04] almost makes them more critical than
[7:06] other people because you see things in
[7:09] the church and the people and around and
[7:12] so I you know the Bible says confess
[7:15] your faults one to another and I pray
[7:17] that I'm not getting too critical
[7:18] because I now I want you want to have
[7:20] the right attitude to her but on the
[7:23] other hand you know I somebody was
[7:25] telling me that they heard a minister is
[7:27] saying behind the closed doors that that
[7:29] he believed that the correct way of this
[7:32] the seals and so forth but yet he
[7:34] wouldn't preach it he would just get out
[7:37] from behind the pulpit and just say well
[7:38] and another one in another situation
[7:40] that the minister would get out and
[7:42] saying I can't explain it as well as
[7:45] brother branham so I'll just play a tape
[7:46] now come on now we got ya don't work
[7:49] it's got a man freeze to get out that if
[7:51] somebody's gotta deliver it and so up
[7:56] just looking at some of these quotes
[7:58] like we're program said the father the
[8:00] father the hour has come what you say
[8:02] and knowing that we're standing your
[8:04] presence some day to give an account for
[8:07] our words even to our thoughts because
[8:10] that's how important it is to not just
[8:12] just come up and and say our own
[8:15] thoughts and our ideas but to lay the
[8:17] word out there so that somebody can grab
[8:19] a hold together because one day we're
[8:22] gonna have to give an account for the
[8:24] words that we speak in the life that we
[8:26] live that's that's how strongly I
[8:29] believe in the correct preaching of the
[8:31] gospel because every Minister I believe
[8:34] is gonna have to give an account did you
[8:35] preach what the messenger for your age
[8:38] Christ and he's gonna have to
[8:41] they count did you preach what Paul
[8:43] preached because they all goes back to
[8:46] the original and if you don't preach the
[8:50] gospel world see how you know James and
[8:54] and James chapter 3 he said it don't be
[8:56] many masters because it's it's kind of
[9:00] hard and then James the next verse he
[9:02] says it he's kind of hard for us to even
[9:05] in normal conversation to get on your
[9:07] word string it's easy to kind of miss
[9:10] things up so don't be desiring to to
[9:13] just give it up behind the pulpit and
[9:14] preach make sure that you got everything
[9:17] in order because it's a it's a dangerous
[9:21] place to get up and lay the word out to
[9:24] the people I mean I think I think of all
[9:27] the times that I looked at back in my
[9:29] life and it heard the word preached in a
[9:31] way that became a stumbling block to me
[9:33] and ministers actually put a stop up
[9:37] your food when they're supposed to be
[9:39] lifting the veil from your eyes but yet
[9:41] they put something obstacle in your way
[9:43] that prevents you from from really
[9:46] taking a hold of the word
[9:47] and grasping and you have to work around
[9:52] this brother I believe in the message
[9:55] presuming he said July July 8th he's
[9:58] talking about how when he thinks about
[10:00] when he's preaching he says did I like
[10:03] our favorite thing I'm just as clear as
[10:04] I've known how to lay it the Lord and I
[10:07] follow your instructions did I say one
[10:09] thing contrary to your word that I keep
[10:11] did i keep every word right on your word
[10:14] because these same people will stand
[10:15] with me in the judgment and I'll have to
[10:18] give an account for what I was saying
[10:19] while I was at this certain place where
[10:22] it is and there's that quote from James
[10:25] where he said be not many masters
[10:27] knowing that we shall receive the
[10:29] greater condemnation because if you get
[10:31] up but you got to live it
[10:32] not just speak it but it's got to be
[10:34] quicker to you also and for me and many
[10:37] things we offend all if me if any man
[10:40] offend not in words
[10:42] was the perfect man and they've also to
[10:43] bridle the whole body and I've said that
[10:51] not to be nothing to be critical but to
[10:53] lay out how important it is the
[10:55] preaching of the gospel unity and then
[10:56] here to the word because the word is
[10:58] what has to be sold so that it can come
[11:02] so that it can mimic begin to grow it's
[11:05] got to be sold it's got to be mixed with
[11:07] the anointing of the Spirit and then it
[11:09] will produce and maybe that will some of
[11:13] these labor slides up you know you look
[11:15] on Facebook and some of the things that
[11:16] people posting it and it begins to look
[11:18] like you know they believers almost
[11:21] question whether the word God can be
[11:23] fulfilled in their life and so that's
[11:26] kind of what I'm getting at is when the
[11:28] word is quickened it will bring forth
[11:32] the problem is our flus are stopped up
[11:35] we can't grasp grab ahold of the word
[11:38] because of all the stuff that's been
[11:39] sold and I you know you for all the
[11:42] things that you've heard all the things
[11:43] that you've got confused about yeah but
[11:46] what the spirit does when it quickens
[11:48] the word is that it removes all
[11:50] confusion and aligns everything up it
[11:53] moves everything right into its correct
[11:56] alignment so that you can see what
[11:59] you're really supposed to be seeing is
[12:00] your own personal Redemption no I'm not
[12:03] a great big old theological book of
[12:05] things that are hard to grasp but
[12:06] anything but you're supposed to see God
[12:08] working in your life to take you out of
[12:11] the things of the world and what are you
[12:12] doing he's got that sharp two-edged
[12:14] sword and it's separating you from the
[12:17] world and lifting you up taking you from
[12:20] the world by the word because that's
[12:23] that's what the word does and it starts
[12:26] off at justification and sanctification
[12:28] the baptism the Holy Ghost virtue Oh
[12:32] always until we are finally completely
[12:36] removed from world
[12:37] we go to meet him in the air and what
[12:39] does that mean your work okay so we're
[12:43] talking about the corn of wheat because
[12:45] that's what we're becoming right and to
[12:47] understand what we are we first have to
[12:50] know who he is right and that's what you
[12:55] know I kind of get a little bit critical
[12:57] when it's presented room who Jesus is
[13:00] because you gotta that's who our faith
[13:03] is based on this food who that maybe is
[13:05] lazily who is because if you don't know
[13:09] who he is then you don't know who died
[13:11] for you and you can have no faith in who
[13:13] you are to become that you're part of
[13:15] him last night look back in the word of
[13:17] the signature you're part of you so in
[13:21] first Corinthians 12:3 says it says
[13:22] wherefore I give you to understand that
[13:24] no man speaking by the Spirit of God
[13:26] call us Jesus accursed and then no man
[13:30] can say that jesus is the lord of I the
[13:32] only ghost but will say no man called
[13:35] Jesus the Christ he said by the Holy
[13:37] Ghost no man can say that jesus is the
[13:39] Anointed One what does that mean then
[13:42] knowing beside except by the Holy Ghost
[13:45] you know but you can't you can't see
[13:47] Jesus in the correct way you can't place
[13:49] him correctly and see who he is and what
[13:53] he is except by the Holy Ghost and that
[13:56] is that is the new birth isn't it the
[13:59] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[14:01] you you think that the threefold mystery
[14:04] because then oh the whole Bible unfolds
[14:06] because all the Bible is the revelation
[14:08] of Jesus Christ that's so high when
[14:11] program said that when he went believe
[14:13] was born again when the ceiling and
[14:15] he'll and the book became a new book
[14:17] beginning because the Holy Spirit began
[14:19] to put all the scripture in exactly the
[14:21] right place and the picture of who Jesus
[14:24] was to begin to unfold him and Jesus
[14:28] said to them in John 12 23 24 then the
[14:31] hour has come that the shuk son of man
[14:33] should be glorified
[14:34] I say to you accept the coin week fall
[14:36] in the ground and die it abideth alone
[14:39] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[14:41] fruit well what kind of fruit is it
[14:43] going to bring if the corn wheat goes in
[14:45] the ground it's going to bring forth
[14:47] another corn wheat right that's the
[14:50] principle of life what goes in the
[14:51] ground is gonna bring forth what goes in
[14:55] the ground it's gonna come up now if you
[14:57] so if you so corruptible seed it's not
[15:01] gonna bring up incorruptible seed that's
[15:03] that's the principle of life and that's
[15:05] why it's so important to preach the the
[15:08] incorruptible Word of God to have it so
[15:12] it can be sown in our life because what
[15:17] you hear false teachers to bring the
[15:19] false births
[15:24] now it was programmed said now it was a
[15:26] paradox when God caused a woman to
[15:28] conceive it was a paradox that how God
[15:30] the eternal that feels all time and
[15:32] eternity could come down become one to a
[15:35] baby crying in a manger
[15:37] now what am I talking about you who was
[15:40] that corner with you it was God in flesh
[15:43] it was God Tabernacle himself in flesh
[15:47] now the corner we in this day's gonna
[15:49] have to be the same thing right
[15:51] oh my goodness that's such a hard thing
[15:54] to almost come over here because you
[15:56] can't comprehend that unless you have a
[15:58] revelation of God's Redemption working
[16:01] in your life otherwise it's just letters
[16:03] on the page this I want to tell you
[16:04] about you I mean you can't say if you're
[16:08] just repeating it like what what blood
[16:09] daily for the way that said about the
[16:11] seals and brother day or whatever then
[16:12] it's just repeating words but it would
[16:14] when the word quickens that and you see
[16:17] it coming to pass in your own life then
[16:19] you're speaking from an experience of
[16:21] not just from a theological
[16:23] interpretation but an experience of his
[16:25] word working in your life and performing
[16:28] what is saying it would do Jehovah a
[16:33] baby Jehovah God a baby crying in a
[16:36] manger over a pile of manure in the
[16:39] manger
[16:40] now who what who was did that baby
[16:43] Jehovah I'm a Jehovah was in that baby
[16:46] it ought to have been striking Jehovah a
[16:49] teenage boy playing Jehovah driving
[16:52] nails as a carpenter no I wasn't Jehovah
[16:56] until the River Jordan no now then
[16:59] you've got quotes fight because he said
[17:02] Jehovah was in that baby crying the main
[17:05] kind of thing you're you're a whole
[17:08] religious experience you're a whole new
[17:11] birth is based on knowing who that man
[17:13] was
[17:14] that man was God in flesh the corn of
[17:19] wheat and that corn wheat with God in
[17:23] flesh planets so that you could come
[17:26] into his image in a paradox he said how
[17:31] that heaven can't hold him earth is his
[17:33] first Oh hip that foot still heaven this
[17:35] is throwing it could bring the fullness
[17:37] of the Godhead bodily and embody it into
[17:40] a man oh and you can measure for
[17:43] hundreds and listen to this this is a
[17:45] strong quote when you can measure for
[17:47] hundreds of billions of miles into eons
[17:50] of time and never measure God
[17:54] get a little baby lying in a manger and
[17:56] contain the fullness of his Guardian
[17:59] bottling right
[18:00] oh that you you can't even fully
[18:02] comprehend no man can see the father
[18:04] only begotten son has declared him you
[18:06] can't you can't measure that without a
[18:08] little puny little minds you can't
[18:10] understand but yet all that was
[18:12] distilled down in that little baby the
[18:14] man who am i but yet will say well that
[18:17] was a quite God yeah until the River
[18:20] Jordan Jehovah a paradox that great God
[18:28] who sits back younger to control a
[18:30] hundred million Suns shining on planets
[18:34] who never began and never ended and
[18:36] would embody himself in a manured state
[18:40] that's a powerful for didn't and that
[18:42] don't say uh we believe the message and
[18:44] we believe all the prophets but
[18:45] everything that we do we really believe
[18:47] it do they understand that now that's
[18:51] what the corner wheat is now we either
[18:53] win the Bible we've got all these
[18:55] different tires shadows everything to
[18:57] help us understand and when when you get
[18:59] the patters begin to lay out then you
[19:02] see that everything's kind of repeated
[19:04] through scripture hmm and listen this is
[19:07] what that Genesis 1:26 man was this is
[19:11] what that Genesis 3 man was that that
[19:14] was promised today he would bruise the
[19:15] head of the serpent this is that man
[19:17] that came down that was then we could
[19:19] not understand but it was put off into
[19:23] that little baby lying in a manger
[19:24] a perfect man and what why this is what
[19:29] God is bringing us truth to through the
[19:32] three-stage process of redemption where
[19:34] first he redeems he fulfills the
[19:37] redemption of your soul and then he
[19:40] blasts out all the flus by the opening
[19:43] of the word so that to get your spirit
[19:45] lined up so that the soul can work at
[19:47] work correctly so the word can be
[19:49] released
[19:50] in your life and you could be a benefit
[19:52] to others and the blessing to others and
[19:54] you can believe God correctly and then
[19:57] he caps it all off with a with a message
[20:00] of redemption that came in this last day
[20:02] you know to redeem your body that's
[20:04] right and that's full redemption that
[20:06] takes you back to it to exactly the way
[20:09] that corn of wheat that was planted in
[20:11] the beginning thing that's it that's a
[20:13] lot of stuff in it that's a lot of her
[20:15] tonight that's what the message is the
[20:19] message is all about the message was
[20:21] they get brother Brown of the cake that
[20:23] God sent program to deliver was not so
[20:25] much to teach us how to be born again
[20:26] yeah because that wasn't all through the
[20:30] seven churches people were being born
[20:32] again right sure and they're being born
[20:33] again by the opening of the word his
[20:35] name that the word was open to them in
[20:38] their day and they believed it and it
[20:40] was their birth to them but in this day
[20:43] something extra had to be given to give
[20:45] us a condition where we can escape the
[20:49] bonds of this earth completely entirely
[20:52] and going to meet him in the air and
[20:54] that's what this is the coral reef is a
[20:57] perfect maintenance so so we talked
[21:03] about that three-stage process that God
[21:06] redeems your your soul he gives you the
[21:08] new birth but then he starts unstopping
[21:11] your fluids and you know what the flu is
[21:13] is is what you think about Christ and
[21:15] what you do is if we just do it like
[21:17] that
[21:17] is what your your your memories and
[21:20] consciousness affection imagination all
[21:22] those five things are what you think
[21:24] about Christ because you think when when
[21:27] you get the number of God puts his faith
[21:29] Galatians 2:20 in your soul and I knew
[21:31] billions believe me or do you beget
[21:33] you've got all this stuff stuff on
[21:36] everything up from the world from your
[21:39] daily walk people saying stuff to you I
[21:41] don't know I'm good enough always good
[21:43] and I
[21:44] got a blast out and so you come to
[21:46] church and a minister preaches something
[21:48] that just knocks you right there and and
[21:50] you go home when you get the you know
[21:52] get to calling out to God or whatever
[21:54] and and and God because you receive the
[21:57] word and God keeps quicker than the word
[21:58] and the more rewards you eat the more it
[22:01] just keeps blasting out and opening up
[22:03] the flus you know I put some pictures
[22:06] here of chimney flues because if you
[22:08] don't if you don't have your flue
[22:10] stopped up then the house will get all
[22:12] smoky and it won't work right you got
[22:14] smoke everywhere in the house and it's
[22:15] just the fire doesn't have a way of
[22:18] escape a way of release because of it
[22:20] know what the new birth is a new birth
[22:22] is the Holy Ghost and firing you that
[22:24] begins to Kindle something inside and to
[22:27] really let it work correctly to let it
[22:30] work right like a locomotive you got to
[22:33] get them flus on the stop the only thing
[22:35] that'll get the flus and stuff though is
[22:37] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[22:39] to receive the word to eat the word and
[22:42] let that word become an Onan in your
[22:44] life and it will bring to pass exactly
[22:46] what the word says it will and that's
[22:52] how you walk with your Christian life
[22:54] you you take the word and you lay it
[22:57] before God and say like David did the
[22:59] second samuel 7:25 i love that scripture
[23:02] where God came and told him the he laid
[23:06] out for David what he was gonna do with
[23:08] the tabernacle I'm gonna I'm gonna come
[23:10] and Tabernacle myself in this in this
[23:12] temple that you built for me and then
[23:14] after God had got the promise in all
[23:17] these things that David David lay down
[23:18] on his face and he said to God you
[23:21] promised these things to Israel and now
[23:23] let it come to pass so I believe that's
[23:26] how our approach to God should be based
[23:28] upon his word you bring him the word and
[23:31] say now let it come to pass in my life
[23:34] first you gotta have the word do you
[23:37] gotta have the word first you gotta have
[23:39] the truth first and then you also gotta
[23:42] have the spirit right let the spirit
[23:44] know that that's right and the spirit
[23:46] woman know what the word unless you
[23:48] you gotta open the door right now doors
[23:52] in the door you gotta open the door and
[23:54] let him come in and and it's really easy
[23:57] I want to show you a quarter million
[23:59] worth look what God said that or what I
[24:02] said that that God wants to heal you a
[24:05] thousand times and the same thing
[24:10] forgiven getting a new birth same thing
[24:11] for all these virtues he wants to see
[24:14] you molded in His image the problem is
[24:17] up that's not God the problem is us
[24:19] making ourselves available not letting
[24:21] the devil suck up all our time giving
[24:24] ourselves to him to read and study and
[24:27] and so his work can be made manifest in
[24:31] us so talking about flus things that
[24:36] people tell you that stop things up and
[24:39] this isn't this is one of them and
[24:42] somebody mentioned after I acted that
[24:43] last sermon I preached where I was
[24:45] talking about how honker burger can be
[24:46] turn into a week ranks in my city can I
[24:49] see that quote because if that's true
[24:50] then anybody can be saved sure you see
[24:54] how we get our flu stocked up
[24:57] somebody said something and then you
[25:00] begin to get in your mind well there's
[25:01] some people that can't be saved but
[25:04] that's not scriptural is it now we know
[25:07] that God had that he knew that we would
[25:09] want it and you saw what would happen
[25:11] and so he had us in his mind for
[25:12] beginning of the world to me always knew
[25:14] you would accept him and that's how he
[25:16] can predestinate we know all that but
[25:19] yet it's open its open if you have a
[25:21] free world sources accept it and here's
[25:23] the quote I had a long list of these
[25:25] places where brother Mel talks about a
[25:27] cop overture being turned into a week
[25:29] earlier and I was a cobbler but all
[25:32] sudden I become weak right now in God's
[25:35] mind we talked about a predestinated
[25:37] seed everything in God's mind he always
[25:39] knew you weren't so that that's that CD
[25:41] yeah way did that attribute that was
[25:43] waiting for you to receive that it can
[25:44] be paid on you and he knew you would
[25:46] receive it yes but you had to come
[25:48] down when you were born on this sort of
[25:49] door because you were born a sinner and
[25:51] lost everything and you had to come to
[25:53] that but the way is open to everybody
[25:56] right now see this we get all these blue
[26:00] that it's uh bothers me so much when
[26:03] people say I don't know if my kids can
[26:05] be saved no I don't know if there's
[26:08] anybody here that this believes that but
[26:10] hey you gotta get that flu blown out if
[26:14] you either there's something keeping
[26:16] your kids from being saved you lay that
[26:19] word God that and acts 2 chapter 2 work
[26:21] they said that promise is under you and
[26:23] all your children if as many as the Lord
[26:25] our God
[26:26] so like lay mad at Jesus feet I tried
[26:28] man and say you promised it now they're
[26:33] coming back in and we gotta get our
[26:38] fluids blown out so many things that
[26:41] keep us from really taking God either
[26:43] the word you know I don't care if you
[26:47] look around and say well I don't see
[26:48] nothing else happened to nobody else's
[26:50] life well I see you moving in my life
[26:54] and I and that's not like here about you
[26:56] know you can look at everybody else's
[26:58] life you can look at you know ministers
[27:00] you look at ministers or say well I
[27:02] don't see nothing happy to his life but
[27:04] that's not the point
[27:05] the word is supposed to make something
[27:07] happen in your home you got to see it
[27:11] from your friend yourself
[27:12] there might be something evident other
[27:14] people's lives that you're not aware of
[27:15] that's right but it's your own life
[27:17] point all the goods in word I want to be
[27:20] made in his rice it's not about
[27:23] everybody else it's not about pointing
[27:25] fingers so much it's about us being made
[27:27] in His image and I was a carver he made
[27:31] a weed out of me
[27:35] take a cover and turn it to week but no
[27:40] end of thought he
[27:41] you always were we sure you always were
[27:43] we to this drink of them sure but down
[27:45] in this life a man you had to come
[27:47] through a process see and of course if
[27:51] you get that straightened out and give
[27:52] you great faith in God always ever that
[27:56] I was gonna come I always predestinate
[27:58] and that that that does kind of make you
[28:00] special it makes you a special person
[28:03] because you're always wearing God's tall
[28:05] because he knew you wanted anything so
[28:06] he always had you in his thinking Emma
[28:09] and that doesn't make you special it is
[28:11] preached in the right way you're not
[28:14] special because God said these people
[28:16] are gonna be saving these people gonna
[28:17] be lost but you're special because God
[28:20] always knew that you would want and then
[28:25] now this is what this is what I saw on
[28:28] Facebook we talked about Facebook for a
[28:30] second I know that's some dangerous
[28:31] topic
[28:32] somebody somebody talking about
[28:34] something in their life going on and
[28:36] they said we won't so sort of be healed
[28:40] now the Lord's will is for you to be
[28:43] here or no want you to be walking around
[28:46] with things that impede your personal
[28:48] walk in life anybody the Lord the Lord
[28:53] wants you to be healed but the problem
[28:54] is our flus are stopped up that's right
[28:56] we started thinking oh maybe it would
[28:59] glorify the Lord more if if I was
[29:02] walking around in this sick condition
[29:04] that that's almost the same line of
[29:07] thought that it would be if if you would
[29:08] say well it would glorify the Lord it
[29:11] for me to be in seeing walking around
[29:13] and then he continually sang me over and
[29:15] over what he wants you to be human my
[29:20] problem is we don't believe that we know
[29:22] in the Bible where it says that
[29:23] everybody that came to him as he walked
[29:25] ashore Galilee but thank God in his
[29:26] presence
[29:28] here that no death could stand in his
[29:30] presence wherever he went if somebody
[29:33] was there he raised him up we know all
[29:35] the things that he said I'm the LORD thy
[29:36] God may he love thee but yet we got our
[29:39] flu stopped up well we can't quite grab
[29:41] ahold of that because we believe it's
[29:43] not that we don't believe that is for us
[29:45] now look at this quote he said he wants
[29:48] to heal you tonight a thousand times
[29:50] more than you want to be healed but
[29:52] you're afraid you go by how you feel
[29:55] because you've regarded that you've
[29:58] lived by your feelings that's your whole
[30:00] life has been wrapped in that how about
[30:02] that how many of us our whole life has
[30:04] been wrapped up and how do we feel
[30:06] we get up in that morning we don't feel
[30:08] good so we think while we're asleep if
[30:10] you move more we get up and it's hard to
[30:12] go to church because of the way we feel
[30:15] and our whole life is wrapped up in
[30:18] feelings how your relationships with
[30:20] people that person doesn't make me feel
[30:22] good this person doesn't make me feel
[30:23] good so I like being around about
[30:25] sometimes our minister will say
[30:27] something to you they won't make you
[30:28] feel good but that don't mean it's not
[30:30] good for you take that medicine that's
[30:36] your whole life has been wrapped in that
[30:38] but you must get away from that and act
[30:40] on God's Word not what you feel not what
[30:43] you see what God said and act on that
[30:45] and make a confession of that confess
[30:48] means to say the same thing like like
[30:51] David did in his prayer and second
[30:53] samuel 7:25 you promised it now let it
[30:56] come to pass because God wants to see
[31:00] his word may manifest in you now here's
[31:06] the here's the flu lung blocker right
[31:07] here can we really quote the scripture
[31:10] in the right way jesus said unto him if
[31:12] thou canst believe some of the some
[31:14] things are possible a little bit of
[31:17] things are possible all things are
[31:19] possible to him that believeth
[31:21] now that take us all into a body change
[31:23] and if you believe if you believe in the
[31:26] word
[31:26] quickly then all things are possible in
[31:29] the belief but then then there's that
[31:32] Court of the the man that Jesus came to
[31:34] to take for healing and he came to Jesus
[31:37] from healing and he said the father of
[31:40] that little child and he said lord I
[31:41] believe help thou mine unbelief now put
[31:46] that put that with the patterns that
[31:47] we've been studying you get born again
[31:49] and you begin really believing but yet
[31:52] there are some things that you quite
[31:54] paint quite grasp onto Lord I believe
[31:57] but help my unbelief that's why this
[32:01] chance your perfect man it says pray for
[32:03] a revelation it's because you believe
[32:06] you're a believer but yet there's still
[32:10] some blockage going on yes that God's
[32:12] got to unblock when all the flows are
[32:15] unblocked then you're you're getting
[32:18] close to a perfect man you're you're
[32:20] getting close to where the headstone can
[32:22] come down and if you're getting shaked
[32:24] up to where you're in the right
[32:26] condition to be to have that anointing
[32:29] fall upon your life so that you're
[32:31] moving in just just the same way as that
[32:35] corn of wheat did now not not that you
[32:39] are the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[32:40] but you are coming to a place where the
[32:43] word is molded and manifested in your
[32:46] life that you know where your place is
[32:48] and you understand what God is doing and
[32:50] you fit perfectly into the into the the
[32:54] whole body of Christ for your age that's
[33:00] where the statue of a perfect man is
[33:02] unstopping the flues the 2nd Peter 1:4
[33:04] dang whereby are given unto us exceeding
[33:06] great and precious promises and we know
[33:09] this scripture very well because it's
[33:10] already been told but it's good to kind
[33:12] of rehash things in it because you know
[33:15] there's there's always let's be honest
[33:17] there's always language behind
[33:19] so mothers need a little bit hey I'm the
[33:23] slowest one here and took me hey I need
[33:26] things to be rehashed over and over
[33:28] before I finally get it
[33:30] yeah just being honest now III need to
[33:36] move it extra he'll sometimes partakers
[33:39] of the divine nature and there's where
[33:41] you begin to believe but yet yeah
[33:43] there's there's more to come right let
[33:45] the word keep unfolding to block out
[33:47] unlock those flus because you believe
[33:50] but yeah there's something blocking it
[33:53] out so you can't let it out and then you
[33:55] hear more word and then you can give out
[33:57] virtue you got something to give to
[33:59] other people
[34:00] virtue and then you keep hearing the
[34:02] word and and and your understanding
[34:06] begins to your understanding of what
[34:08] take a lot under concepts understanding
[34:10] of who Jesus is and your place in his
[34:13] body that's knowledge real knowledge is
[34:15] knowledge above Jesus Christ answers an
[34:17] old up until until you're the flues are
[34:20] so unblocked that you can give up
[34:22] brother come to somebody hate your goods
[34:25] and yet you still can put your arms
[34:27] around them and love them and not just
[34:29] put your arms around the love but pray
[34:31] for that brother and call out to God on
[34:33] that brothers half because you so the
[34:50] who go back to the corner we who that
[34:53] corner baby is and the corner we is the
[34:56] unknown inferred and the anointed word
[34:59] is gonna bring to pass what it's
[35:02] supposed to be kids got to be anointed
[35:03] either go back to that that sermon this
[35:05] is one of my favorite sons be certain of
[35:08] God if you ever get a look down and get
[35:11] like brother Jules said while he was
[35:13] gonna listen to be certain of God
[35:14] because I
[35:15] that's one of the most unknown at
[35:17] sermons that brother Brenner priest when
[35:19] he lays out with that that the logic
[35:23] going down to the low the woman's air
[35:26] path and she made him that cake and
[35:28] ingredients of it tell you in very
[35:31] simple terms exactly how to be boring in
[35:33] the truck there's another reason for a
[35:36] preaching of the gospel so I I heard
[35:38] somebody from another church say I wish
[35:40] it my pastor would lay down exactly how
[35:44] to be born again I I don't know how to
[35:46] be boarded either and that that grieves
[35:49] me so bad and you know will maybe get it
[35:52] get all high and mighty in ourselves but
[35:54] I wonder if if we went around the room
[35:56] tonight tonight what everybody in this
[35:59] room would be able to explain how to be
[36:01] born yet and would you be able to do it
[36:03] sure yeah but not don't give up and
[36:06] teach you know how to be and if you
[36:10] don't you maybe start off with this
[36:12] sermon because this sermon will explain
[36:14] in very simple terms how to be born
[36:17] again you gotta take the ole and this
[36:20] and the spirit and truth like that don't
[36:23] let the well came to Jesus you said back
[36:25] well some worship over here somewhere
[36:26] sheep over there
[36:27] we don't know where quite where to
[36:28] worship and do you said whether and how
[36:30] it is it is now gonna come that they're
[36:33] worshippers gonna worship in spirit and
[36:35] in truth he later that spirit and truth
[36:39] you gotta have the truth and then you
[36:43] also gotta have the spirit right if you
[36:45] don't have the spirit then you just
[36:46] state election and the intellectual be
[36:48] like st. Augustine that just argued over
[36:51] the word and and thinks they understand
[36:53] the word and then starts like saying
[36:54] always they did killing the Christians
[36:56] because they didn't agree with his
[36:57] doctrine that's just intellectual but
[37:00] this a spirit-filled just an unadorned
[37:04] in one will have just the spirit on
[37:06] their life on their spirit but at the
[37:08] end their soul the word is not
[37:10] there's no word that they've received
[37:12] there's no word they've failed to
[37:14] quicken it but if you can get both
[37:16] together then they will produce
[37:17] something you know we talked about
[37:19] annoying ones that everything there's
[37:21] nothing wrong with we have been anointed
[37:22] I won't be anointed because program
[37:25] explain the difference between an
[37:26] anointing one is not the sign is a
[37:29] wonders both have the signs of wonders
[37:32] the only difference is the word and the
[37:36] word is one of the differences so I want
[37:39] an anointing in my life let's look look
[37:41] what my mom says here and the spirit mix
[37:43] with the truth has got to bring
[37:45] something ever put it together it makes
[37:48] a cake you see that's the recipe for
[37:51] being born you put those two together
[37:53] and it makes the cake and then you can
[37:55] live off that you can live off that cake
[37:57] we're not talking about a natural cake
[37:59] game we're talking about spiritual cake
[38:01] a supernatural cake the keeps keeps on
[38:03] moving and out of the letter by the
[38:09] spirit and if the word abides in you
[38:14] then you're anointed person with the
[38:16] word they talking about how Christ is
[38:18] the anointed work that's Christ and you
[38:21] and Nonie the word for this age whatever
[38:23] age they lived in a god a noise somebody
[38:25] sends it down and makes that word act
[38:28] just exactly the way he said it didn't
[38:32] to prove that Jesus Christ is the same
[38:35] yesterday today and forever then where
[38:40] are you going with this go along well
[38:43] where I want is
[38:47] I'm about to run out of time where I'm
[38:52] going is back to that corner week who
[38:55] isn't that Gordon week and I because you
[38:59] know the word Christ he was we call him
[39:01] Jesus Christ because Christ the Messiah
[39:03] is that known at one he was the anointed
[39:06] quarter it was annoying to you know the
[39:08] word for his day where when did he get
[39:10] an owner we know I kind of know when
[39:12] you're on the River Jordan but Christ
[39:13] means The Anointed that's right that
[39:15] logos that came out of God from
[39:16] beginning to the world came out from the
[39:18] Father what was already annoying
[39:20] didn't that Jehovah that little baby
[39:22] interlining he cradle that soul that was
[39:24] in him was already a known enemy but
[39:27] something happened at the River Jordan
[39:29] an anointing to push him to get him to
[39:32] quicken his life into the minister I
[39:34] happened at the river Joey but before
[39:36] then he already was anointed and that's
[39:40] how when you get the new birth the the
[39:42] word is anointed in your life to bring
[39:44] you into a birth begin to begin then you
[39:48] begin you keep eating the word and the
[39:49] word is anointed and it keeps pushing
[39:51] you all up into a higher place the word
[39:55] anointing the word and it will prove it
[39:58] will it will make manifest what the word
[40:01] says on letter form the Spirit is what
[40:06] makes it a little bit go back in Genesis
[40:07] when the Spirit of God began to woo over
[40:10] the earth and wooed over the word that
[40:12] was already soul in the earth the Spirit
[40:14] is what made that word come to life and
[40:17] just went to the earth was without form
[40:19] and void and darkness was upon the face
[40:21] of the deep and the spirit not bad let
[40:24] me get my tongue untangled here and the
[40:26] Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[40:28] waters and I got just like a little
[40:30] graphic here like a Leica and that great
[40:32] eagle spirit moving over the waters to
[40:34] bring the earth back into his right
[40:37] condition to get everything lined up
[40:39] again and that's that's what Christ the
[40:41] mystery God revealed is that's God is
[40:43] bringing the earth back into its evening
[40:46] light condition bringing the bride back
[40:49] into the condition of the groom and
[40:51] bringing everything
[40:52] into harmony with him guess what the
[40:54] spirit does the word has been spoken for
[40:57] the spirit will make it live and how
[40:59] does the spirit the spirit comes the
[41:01] journal of life is sold through the body
[41:03] it's got to come through the body by the
[41:06] preaching of the gospel by from your
[41:07] attitude of the word in it and that's
[41:10] what brings it oh I'm just gonna stop
[41:13] looky-looky going on I've got uh I got
[41:17] seen I got eighty slides and we're only
[41:19] able slide twin
