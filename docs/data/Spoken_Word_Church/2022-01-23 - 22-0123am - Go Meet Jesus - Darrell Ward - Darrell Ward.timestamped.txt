[5:16] thank you
[5:17] we just have one service today so we're
[5:19] just going to take our time and just
[5:21] enjoy the presence of the lord here and
[5:23] the testimony and the singing so
[5:26] we'll appreciate it come over here
[5:34] next time i get the microphone
[5:36] um
[5:37] i just want to give a testimony um
[5:40] and
[5:42] two years ago memorial day on memorial
[5:45] day of
[5:46] what when 2000 right so
[5:48] memorial day of 2020
[5:52] i got here memorial day
[5:54] and the lord opened up a way for me to
[5:56] get out of the sin i was living in and
[5:58] um i thought that wasn't going to happen
[6:00] because i was i was deep gone
[6:02] i was so far gone i didn't think god was
[6:04] gonna forgive me anymore i thought that
[6:06] was it because i knew better
[6:08] and you know in the word it says when
[6:10] god tells you not to sin anymore or
[6:12] worse the thing will come upon you he
[6:13] means that and a worship thing did come
[6:16] up on me the last situation i was in and
[6:18] i just thought it that was it
[6:20] i was looking up testimonies from
[6:23] different people to see if god actually
[6:25] forgave them when they went so far
[6:27] but he did open up a way and i just want
[6:29] to um
[6:30] i thought i was a i was a vessel of
[6:32] dishonor i was really a vessel of
[6:35] dishonor and i was thinking when i was
[6:38] deep in my sin that
[6:40] lord i don't want to die being a vessel
[6:41] of dishonor because you're either going
[6:42] to be a vessel of honor or dishonor when
[6:44] you leave this earth
[6:45] and so i was like god please help me i
[6:47] do not want to die with that title on my
[6:50] name on my soul in my life a vessel of
[6:53] dishonor
[6:54] so when he got me out of everything
[6:57] it took a minute it took a minute for
[6:58] the fear and all these different things
[7:00] that was on me to actually leave the
[7:02] situation i was in
[7:03] and i felt this was the right time to
[7:05] share this because
[7:07] it's a lot of young people here and you
[7:08] guys are going to go through things
[7:10] hopefully you don't go through some
[7:11] things i went through but i've been
[7:12] through a lot
[7:13] but um the last situation i was in i was
[7:16] involved with a
[7:17] a very handsome guy very nice guy
[7:20] but behind the scene of that was satan
[7:23] so satan will give you things
[7:25] that will be very enticing
[7:28] sin is always not going to be ugly satan
[7:30] knows what you like
[7:32] but god also gives god also give
[7:34] permission to satan
[7:36] to try you to test you
[7:38] so you can go through things as well so
[7:41] he sent this this handsome man my way
[7:45] and it was everything i wanted in the
[7:46] flesh it was
[7:48] everything i wanted in the flesh i mean
[7:51] i had the house
[7:53] the the gifts the flattering the cars
[7:56] everything looked good on the outside
[7:57] everything looked so good if you was
[7:59] outside looking in you would want what i
[8:01] thought i had okay but
[8:03] the bottom line was it was a trap it was
[8:06] a trap with my soul
[8:07] it was also not only a trap it was a
[8:11] a trap in a way that you i couldn't get
[8:13] out unless god took me out of that
[8:15] in the midst of that we also have a baby
[8:17] my baby is still there and i'm fighting
[8:19] going through custody battle right now
[8:21] so um
[8:25] i was praying when i was in the midst it
[8:26] was together for 13 years on and off so
[8:29] it was a real
[8:31] i was very wrapped up in it very wrapped
[8:33] up in it
[8:34] um but there was red flags all over the
[8:36] place it was all type of red flags i
[8:38] knew i wasn't living right i knew it but
[8:41] i couldn't get out of it for him he
[8:43] didn't really know it because he's he's
[8:45] living in the world he's
[8:46] when you don't have god in your soul or
[8:48] whatever just like adam and eve adam
[8:50] knew when he
[8:52] when he gave in to eve eve was deceived
[8:54] so in this situation i knew i wasn't
[8:56] deceive i knew what i was doing but i
[8:58] was miserable i was so miserable that
[9:01] oh lord you know you got to get me out
[9:03] of this because i can't get out of it on
[9:05] my own i couldn't
[9:06] anyway he made a way long story short he
[9:08] made a way out
[9:09] um i'm going to hurry up i just want to
[9:12] share some of the things that i've
[9:15] been going through that god delivered me
[9:16] from um
[9:18] okay so this was a situation
[9:20] um i work i do cleaning so i got to go
[9:22] to customers houses okay
[9:25] so
[9:26] it's this guy that i work for not
[9:28] anymore um
[9:30] but he was
[9:31] coming in with a lot of flattery
[9:33] okay a lot of things i've dealt with a
[9:35] lot of things in my life so this this
[9:37] man was coming in with a lot of flattery
[9:38] this just happened probably a week ago
[9:41] uh he came in with a lot of flattery
[9:42] giving me stuff very nice um i went to
[9:45] his baptism he got baptized and
[9:47] everything i wasn't attracted to him at
[9:49] all not like that because i know what
[9:50] god just got me out of so i wasn't
[9:52] looking for that at all but he was
[9:53] really nice he invited me to his baptism
[9:55] he got baptized in the name of jesus
[9:57] christ he wasn't a message believer or
[9:58] anything like that but i went just to
[10:00] support that he was getting better i was
[10:01] like wow that's good
[10:02] so anyway um he's a single guy but he
[10:05] was always
[10:06] really really nice and really really
[10:10] offering me things and and saying little
[10:12] things like wow you look good in my
[10:13] house and um you you know just saying
[10:16] little things you know and sometimes you
[10:17] kind of hear it but you're not paying
[10:18] attention to it so anyway the lord kind
[10:20] of started opening my eyes and making me
[10:22] aware that you know be careful this is
[10:24] the same guy told you that was calling
[10:26] me beautiful and stuff and god change
[10:27] him
[10:28] put it on his heart and stop calling me
[10:29] that and using my name this is the same
[10:31] guy
[10:32] so um
[10:35] the other day you know he was saying
[10:37] little stuff you know you look you look
[10:38] really good in my house you know and
[10:40] um just different little things
[10:42] so i started just to kind of feel a
[10:44] little bit uncomfortable so what i did i
[10:46] left
[10:47] and um you know before i left he was
[10:49] like you know i'll take you know if you
[10:50] ever want to go out just let me know now
[10:51] i already corrected him before about
[10:53] asking me out i'm not there for that i'm
[10:55] here to do a service and that's it
[10:56] so this time when he asked me before i
[10:58] left um he was like you know if you ever
[11:00] want to go out again just let me know
[11:02] so i got in my car i got home and i
[11:04] started thinking about it like man i
[11:05] just told this guy i'm not interested in
[11:07] going out i'm not you know i'm gonna
[11:08] have to just let him know a little bit
[11:10] harder now because i was kind of nice
[11:11] about it at first
[11:13] um one thing i want to add is be careful
[11:15] of flattery be careful because what
[11:18] it'll do it'll kind of break you down
[11:19] when they're really really nice it'll
[11:21] kind of break you down where you almost
[11:23] don't want to be mean to them or you
[11:24] don't want to be you don't want to stand
[11:25] up because they're so nice you know so
[11:27] be careful of flattery and when they're
[11:29] kind of giving giving you too much you
[11:30] know giving you too much attention or
[11:32] you know unnecessary attention and stuff
[11:34] like that i think that's a that's a trap
[11:36] be careful
[11:37] unless that's your husband and you
[11:38] courting you know it's different it's a
[11:40] different different level um so anyway i
[11:43] caught him up i'm going to hurry up
[11:44] sorry i called him up and um
[11:47] i left him a message this time and i
[11:48] said i'm look
[11:50] i told you before
[11:52] i won't be asking you out i don't need
[11:53] you to ask me out i am not interested i
[11:56] don't even date customers because it's
[11:58] sloppy and just some things i said to
[11:59] them and i said i mentioned this to you
[12:01] before and i feel disrespected and i
[12:03] won't be coming back if you can't
[12:05] respect where i'm coming from
[12:07] all right so anyway he sent me another
[12:08] message back and apologizing oh i just
[12:10] want to be friends and you know i won't
[12:11] do that anymore so anyway
[12:13] uh what happened with that is the lord
[12:15] just put it on my heart like you know
[12:16] don't even go back at all
[12:17] because this will happen again because
[12:20] this this guy's living in darkness to
[12:22] them it's kind of crazy that you're even
[12:24] coming off like that because he's just a
[12:25] man you know but the spirit behind that
[12:29] they don't understand why are you being
[12:31] like that i'm being nice to you i'm
[12:33] offering you stuff well you know what's
[12:34] wrong with you in other words you're
[12:35] kind of crazy to them you know when you
[12:37] come off like that in a way
[12:39] so um i was like no this is dangerous
[12:41] and the stuff i just came out of i know
[12:43] to be way more careful um to not just
[12:46] give into that kind of flattery
[12:48] um i'm no match for satan and i don't
[12:50] know what he got up the sleeve but i
[12:52] know enough to know from my experience
[12:54] to be careful of that
[12:55] um so that was that was that situation
[12:58] that happened one more thing is
[13:00] i just want to add while you guys are on
[13:01] your walk or whatever
[13:04] you're going to get tested sometimes in
[13:06] different ways when you're not expecting
[13:08] it it's going to come out the blue
[13:09] sometimes you're going to get tested for
[13:10] example it was a situation i was i was
[13:12] at a grocery store
[13:14] and i picked up some items or whatever
[13:16] and um it was a young guy there the
[13:17] cashier the cash you know the cashier
[13:20] and uh
[13:21] he was wringing out my items and he
[13:23] wasn't sure how much a certain thing
[13:24] cost so he was just kind of like go
[13:26] ahead with it don't worry about it i'm
[13:28] like oh here we go i got to correct this
[13:29] now here we go okay
[13:31] so um i said no no no i want i want you
[13:34] to ring that up he said well i'm trying
[13:35] to hook you up
[13:38] i said well are you the manager he was
[13:39] like well no i said well i don't i don't
[13:41] want you to hook me hook me up to what
[13:42] what you want to hook me up to some so
[13:44] i'm not getting hooked up in those
[13:45] saving traps
[13:46] so um i said no no just bring it up for
[13:48] what it is
[13:49] and um he's like i'm just trying to hook
[13:50] you up
[13:51] i said like i understand you know young
[13:53] i understand i said when before god got
[13:55] ahold of my life i would have loved your
[13:56] hook up i want to be ex you when you're
[13:58] coming back to work again so i can get
[13:59] some more hooks up you know so but this
[14:01] time when god starts strengthening you
[14:03] you start being more aware of little
[14:04] traps and stuff you know don't hook me
[14:06] up to none of your devices nope
[14:08] so um
[14:10] he was like wow okay um it's kind of
[14:12] like god put the light in you and you
[14:14] start putting you giving them the light
[14:15] i don't know what it should be is you
[14:16] should do it this way because you can
[14:17] lose your job and everything you know
[14:19] so anyway god start giving you that
[14:21] strength you need him he'll give you
[14:23] that strength you need to keep going to
[14:25] be bold to be honest with people instead
[14:28] of flattery and okay yeah sure yeah you
[14:30] don't want to be that way that that
[14:32] thing will trap you up so um
[14:34] you want to be able to be bold and
[14:36] honest with people they appreciate that
[14:37] more than just being a yes yes yes
[14:40] person you know they appreciate your
[14:41] honesty it'll save them you know so it
[14:44] was like a light bulb came on in his
[14:45] head he was like wow okay nobody ever
[14:47] confronted me i mean okay
[14:49] so anyway i gave him five dollars
[14:51] i'm gonna pay you to do the right thing
[14:52] next time like for real like yeah for
[14:55] real so um
[14:56] um that was that was one incident the
[14:59] last incident is this all these things
[15:01] just happened not too long ago so i want
[15:02] to share it so i don't forget
[15:04] i was at my job i work at a hotel
[15:06] part-time as well
[15:08] uh sometimes they have snacks there and
[15:10] you can get them
[15:11] but i get them and i pay for them if i
[15:13] don't have the money right away i bring
[15:14] the money in the next day so one of my
[15:16] co-workers um she was there the next day
[15:18] and i gave her a couple dollars for some
[15:20] of the things i i got the day before
[15:23] she was like um
[15:24] yeah i got a paper that you know you
[15:25] don't have to pay for this stuff
[15:27] i said well is it okay for us to just
[15:28] take it or she said well everybody else
[15:30] doing it and i do it so i was like well
[15:32] i don't want to be like everybody else
[15:34] you know and um
[15:35] you right when you correct somebody you
[15:37] can feel that odd feeling like okay all
[15:39] of a sudden you separate from what
[15:41] everybody else is doing so you got to
[15:43] feel those little odd funny feelings
[15:44] like oh i'm different i'm set apart i
[15:46] feel weird all of a sudden but no
[15:48] embrace that because it's actually
[15:50] building you up to become more and more
[15:51] stronger for the lord you want to stand
[15:53] up you know what i'm saying
[15:55] it's every the whole world is full of
[15:57] darkness so whenever you stand out be
[15:59] prepared to feel funny when you're
[16:00] correct and what's wrong okay
[16:03] all right that's it
[16:04] [Applause]
[16:14] that's why it's so important to
[16:17] look for that character of christ in
[16:19] people
[16:20] because character only comes through
[16:22] victory and victory of battles and
[16:24] overcoming amen if the brother could
[16:26] pull up the song in the back before
[16:29] um
[16:30] how great is their god
[16:32] they could pull it up in the back on the
[16:34] screen we'll sing this before our
[16:36] brother comes this morning
[16:38] hallelujah he's great there's none like
[16:41] him a man he works in every facet of our
[16:43] life and testimony was just you know
[16:47] kids there were just singing this little
[16:49] light of mine sister rebecca that's
[16:52] that's a wonderful testimony that you're
[16:54] being a witness and i encourage each of
[16:56] us wherever you are
[16:58] don't be afraid to stand up for what
[17:00] god's doing in your life this world
[17:02] needs
[17:03] that testimony
[17:05] people need to see god in you and it's
[17:07] those little day-to-day things
[17:10] that makes that impression on out here
[17:12] in the world where they say something's
[17:14] real in there
[17:16] she's not like the rest of the world i
[17:17] see something different
[17:19] and eventually they'll see christ amen

[27:53] do you love him
[27:54] amen
[27:57] the bible says this
[28:00] then when jesus came
[28:02] he found that he had lain in the grave
[28:05] four days already
[28:07] now bethany was now unto jerusalem about
[28:10] 15 followings off
[28:12] and many of the jews came to martha and
[28:14] mary to comfort them concerning their
[28:16] brother
[28:17] then martha as soon as she heard that
[28:19] jesus was coming
[28:21] she went out and met him
[28:23] but mary
[28:25] set still
[28:26] in the house
[28:28] then said martha unto jesus lord
[28:31] if thou has been here my brother had not
[28:33] died
[28:34] but i know that even now
[28:37] whatsoever thou will ask of god god will
[28:41] give it thee
[28:43] and jesus saith unto her thy brother
[28:46] shall rise again
[28:48] and martha said unto him i know that he
[28:51] shall rise again in the resurrection at
[28:54] the last day
[28:55] and jesus said unto her i am the
[28:58] resurrection and the life
[29:00] he that believeth in me though he were
[29:02] dead yet shall he live
[29:06] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[29:09] shall never
[29:10] die believe us thou this
[29:14] amen
[29:16] let us bow our heads i want to speak to
[29:17] you this morning on a simple thought of
[29:20] go meet jesus
[29:23] heavenly father
[29:25] thy word is true
[29:27] we commit this congregation and
[29:29] ourselves
[29:30] into your hands for your glory
[29:33] in jesus name
[29:35] god bless you saying she may be seated
[29:36] this morning i want to call your
[29:38] attention back to verse 20.
[29:43] amen
[29:44] i thought he said just lay your coat in
[29:47] the floor
[29:48] he said no put it on the chair
[29:51] amen
[29:53] i lost some of my hearing when i was in
[29:55] the military i was with the airborne
[29:56] artillery up at fort bragg and fired the
[29:58] big guns and so i lost a little bit of
[30:01] my hearing and the the va gave me some
[30:03] hearing aids i guess i need to wear them
[30:07] amen i want to call your attention back
[30:08] to verse 20 where it says this then
[30:10] martha as soon as she heard that jesus
[30:13] was coming
[30:14] she went out and met him
[30:16] but mary sat still
[30:18] in the house
[30:20] now brother sister i i believe this
[30:22] morning that these two sisters
[30:25] represents everyone
[30:27] that is in this building
[30:29] this morning
[30:31] for the way i see it we can do one or
[30:33] two things
[30:34] we can do like martha when she heard
[30:36] that jesus was come she got up and went
[30:39] to meet him
[30:41] or we can be like mary
[30:43] and set still
[30:45] in the house
[30:46] you see you're going to do one or the
[30:48] other jesus said where two or three are
[30:51] gathered in my name i will be in their
[30:53] midst
[30:55] now many people come to church for many
[30:57] different reasons
[30:58] but i want you to know that when he
[31:00] comes
[31:01] he comes in the power of his
[31:03] resurrection
[31:05] he sends healing in the form of his word
[31:08] he comes to pour out the holy ghost he
[31:11] comes to fulfill every promise that he
[31:14] made to the believer he comes to bring
[31:16] deliverance he comes to bring healing he
[31:18] comes to bring forgiveness he comes to
[31:20] bring joy unspeakable and full of glory
[31:24] when jesus comes the temptus power is
[31:27] broken
[31:28] and when he comes we can either get up
[31:31] and go meet him
[31:32] or we can sit still
[31:35] in the house
[31:36] but i say to you this morning let's not
[31:38] sit still
[31:40] he's here his word says he's here then
[31:43] let us get up and possess what belongs
[31:46] to us
[31:47] this is our day this is our hour this is
[31:50] our time to shine in the light amen the
[31:53] promises of god's word for today they
[31:56] are for the believer they belong to us
[32:00] as caleb said give me my mountain amen
[32:04] give me what god has given me it belongs
[32:07] to me
[32:09] amen like that sister that was in the
[32:10] communist country that wasn't allowed to
[32:12] have church and so a baker he was a
[32:15] believer also
[32:18] and so they he would bake a certain kind
[32:20] of bread
[32:22] and the believers knew to ask for this
[32:24] bread
[32:25] and so the sister went down to the
[32:27] bakery and asked for the bread and she
[32:29] broke the bread
[32:31] and inside the open of the bread was the
[32:34] revelation of where the meeting was to
[32:36] take place
[32:38] and on the way to the meeting she was
[32:40] met by a communist soldier
[32:42] and he stuck his rifle with a bayonet
[32:44] right up under her chin he said where
[32:46] are you going
[32:48] she said my brother died
[32:50] and i'm going for the reading of the
[32:52] wheel
[32:53] she goes to church and they sing songs
[32:56] and they rejoice
[32:57] somebody repents
[32:59] somebody gets the holy ghost somebody
[33:01] got saved someone spoke in tongues and a
[33:04] prophecy and interpretation went forth
[33:06] they had foot washers and they had
[33:07] communion and oh my i like services like
[33:10] that don't you
[33:11] and so on the way home she was singing
[33:13] the holy ghost is mine joyous mind
[33:16] healing his mind all mine and she ran
[33:19] into the same
[33:20] soldier
[33:22] and he said what did your brother leave
[33:24] you
[33:26] she said oh
[33:27] he left me everything.
[33:33] every redemptive blessing belongs to the
[33:36] believer then i say to you this morning
[33:39] let's not let the devil rob us of none
[33:41] of them amen
[33:42] i say let's get up and go meet jesus you
[33:45] see jesus is the answer to every problem
[33:49] you have
[33:51] you say i'm sick well then get up and
[33:53] let's go meet jesus i'm discouraged and
[33:55] get up and go meet him amen you see all
[33:58] mary knew that death had come to their
[34:00] house sorrow and fear had all come to
[34:03] their house and it's sad to say but
[34:05] that's all that some people ever see
[34:08] is darkness and sadness and depression
[34:10] and negativity nothing ever works out
[34:12] right and nobody cares for me that's all
[34:15] some people ever see
[34:16] but mark the caller revelation
[34:19] hallelujah mark the caller revelation
[34:22] that caused her to get up
[34:24] and go meet jesus
[34:26] you see in our bible study this morning
[34:28] death had struck the home of mary and
[34:31] martha and no doubt they thought how
[34:33] could this happen to us
[34:36] jesus
[34:37] is our friend
[34:39] he
[34:40] slept in our spare room he's he's set at
[34:42] our table
[34:44] we're message believers
[34:47] we've left everything
[34:49] to follow him
[34:51] how could this sorrow come to us how
[34:54] could the doctor's report
[34:56] be so bad
[34:58] we're his people we should never have
[35:00] trials we should never have trouble
[35:03] every day should just be blue skies and
[35:06] smooth sailing every day should just be
[35:08] a picnic
[35:10] those are nice thoughts
[35:12] i like a good picnic
[35:14] but you see the problem of it is
[35:17] jesus never promised us that
[35:20] come on somebody
[35:22] he never said we wouldn't cry
[35:24] he never said we wouldn't have sorrow he
[35:27] never said we wouldn't suffer he never
[35:29] said we wouldn't get sick he never said
[35:31] there wouldn't be pandemics he never
[35:34] promised smooth sailing he never said
[35:36] there wouldn't be storms oh hallelujah
[35:39] but he did say i will never leave you
[35:42] nor would i forsake you then no matter
[35:44] what i face today i do not face it alone
[35:48] amen
[35:50] hallelujah sometimes god allows things
[35:53] to come into our lives like our sister
[35:55] was testified of god will allow things
[35:57] to come into our lives so that he come
[35:59] to us and show us just how great he is
[36:06] amen
[36:07] you may have a great cancer you may have
[36:09] a great trial you may have a great
[36:11] problem i'm not denying that i'm just
[36:13] here to tell you this morning you're
[36:15] god's greater
[36:20] amen
[36:21] i'm not listen to me
[36:23] i'm not taking light of your suffering
[36:26] we have real tears
[36:28] we have real pain
[36:32] i know what it is when your back hurts
[36:34] so bad the fire shooting out the end of
[36:36] your toes and you have to pray to even
[36:38] get out of the car to pump gas because
[36:40] you can't hardly get one leg in front of
[36:42] the other because your back is hurting
[36:43] so bad real tears real pain real
[36:46] problems
[36:48] oh hallelujah but a real god
[36:51] who's bigger than all my problems who's
[36:53] bigger than all my fears come on
[36:55] somebody our god is bigger
[36:58] than anything their enemy could ever put
[37:00] upon us
[37:02] amen
[37:04] hallelujah
[37:05] mary and martha in this great time of
[37:07] sorrow
[37:09] in this great time of need it was
[37:12] their darkest
[37:13] hour
[37:15] think of it mary and martha left alone
[37:18] their mother was gone their father was
[37:19] gone
[37:20] and now lazarus was gone and just them
[37:23] two girls left alone in the world their
[37:26] brother was goldie he was the
[37:27] breadwinner he was their protection he
[37:30] was the one who was going to make sure
[37:31] the rent was paid
[37:34] he was the one they leaned on
[37:36] he was the one that promised mom and
[37:37] daddy he'd take care of him and now he's
[37:40] gone
[37:41] and there they sat in sackcloth and
[37:44] black veils
[37:45] weeping and mourning over their brother
[37:48] it was the darkest hour but i want you
[37:51] to know that's always when jesus shows
[37:53] up
[37:55] amen
[37:56] that's just the way he does it brother
[37:58] sister this may be the darkest hour
[38:00] you've ever faced in your life and if it
[38:02] is i've got good news for you this
[38:04] morning get ready for your visitation
[38:07] hallelujah it was the darkest hour that
[38:10] the woman with the blunted she would
[38:11] ever seen 12 years of bleeding and it
[38:14] would not stop and the doctor said they
[38:16] couldn't help her and the prophet said
[38:18] she sold her farm but in that dark hour
[38:21] when there was no essential oil there
[38:23] was no herb that could help her then
[38:26] jesus came along
[38:28] it was the darkest hour jairus had ever
[38:30] saw his little girl laying dead
[38:33] oh my and the mourners and the whalers
[38:36] in his house but then jesus
[38:38] came along
[38:40] the darkest hour the disciples ever saw
[38:42] when ten thousand demons swore they
[38:45] would drown them that night it was their
[38:47] darkest hour that jesus come walking on
[38:50] the water
[38:52] oh my and it was the darkest hour that
[38:55] martha and mary had ever seen it was
[38:58] that dark hour that martha got word
[39:02] that jesus
[39:04] had come
[39:05] you see martha realized the answer to
[39:08] her sorrow the answer to her darkness
[39:11] the answer to her fear was jesus
[39:17] amen i know you think it's cdc but it
[39:19] ain't
[39:21] she realized
[39:24] god had a way provided
[39:26] and jesus was the answer for everything
[39:30] she was going through he's the answer
[39:32] then he's the answer now and if there is
[39:34] a tomorrow he will be the answer
[39:37] tomorrow
[39:38] jesus is the answer amen
[39:42] when she got word that he had come she
[39:44] got up
[39:45] and went
[39:46] to meet him
[39:48] he reminds me of blind bartimaeus
[39:52] sitting there on the rocks
[39:54] of the walls of jericho
[39:56] and he wore a beggar's robe
[39:59] that identified him as a blind
[40:02] beggar
[40:04] and set it in the sun
[40:07] tried to get a few pennies he got to
[40:10] thinking
[40:12] about his life
[40:14] you know sometimes i think it's good if
[40:15] we just slow down
[40:17] and remember
[40:20] remember what god has done for you
[40:22] remember how he's answered your prayers
[40:24] remember that night he come to you and
[40:27] delivered you from alcohol or delivered
[40:28] you from drugs
[40:30] well hallelujah
[40:33] sitting there in the sun he got to
[40:35] remember it he thought
[40:38] i used to have some doves
[40:41] what happened
[40:42] to those doves
[40:45] oh i remember
[40:47] i remember
[40:49] my little girl got sick
[40:52] i remember
[40:54] and the doctor said she was going to die
[40:57] and i went behind the house
[40:59] and i lifted up my eyes to get over
[41:02] i said father
[41:05] my little girl's sick
[41:09] i need her lord
[41:11] i see the world
[41:14] through her us
[41:15] i hear a bird sing and she tells me what
[41:18] it looks like i smell the fragrance of a
[41:20] flower and she describes it to me
[41:23] she tells me the shapes that the clouds
[41:25] make
[41:26] and the blueness of the sky
[41:29] don't take her from me lord
[41:31] she's my little girl
[41:34] if you let her live
[41:37] i'll give you my dubs
[41:41] and he took
[41:42] she got well and he went
[41:44] he said i gave those doves
[41:47] wasn't long after that
[41:50] and my wife got sick
[41:52] perhaps it was a pandemic
[41:55] perhaps she got what the girl had i we
[41:57] really don't know but
[41:59] so he goes out behind the house again
[42:01] and he lifts up his eyes he said father
[42:05] my little queen
[42:07] he's sick
[42:09] don't take her from me lord
[42:12] i need her
[42:15] she puts my plate exactly the same place
[42:18] every time so i can find it my cup is
[42:20] always at the same place she washes my
[42:23] clothes she cooks for me
[42:25] i need her lord
[42:27] if you let her live
[42:30] i'll give you my lamb
[42:32] you know the prophet you know the story
[42:34] the prophet told us in those days the
[42:35] lamb was a sea and high animal like they
[42:37] used the dog today
[42:39] and so he goes down to the temple
[42:42] and on the way down there he runs it to
[42:44] the priest
[42:45] he said where you going bartimaeus he
[42:47] said i'm going to the temple to give god
[42:49] my lamb
[42:50] he said you can't do that you need that
[42:53] lampshade here take this money go buy
[42:55] you a lamb
[42:57] he said but i never promised god a lamb
[42:59] i promised god this lamb and if i keep
[43:03] my promise to god he will provide a lamb
[43:07] for my eyes
[43:08] and sitting there on the rocks he
[43:10] thought what made me say that oh thank
[43:13] god for inspiration that sometimes
[43:15] strikes us and we will say something we
[43:18] don't even realize that we're saying
[43:21] what made me say that that god would
[43:23] provide a lamb from my eyes
[43:26] and sitting there thinking on the ways
[43:28] of this lamb
[43:30] he begins to hear a noise
[43:32] and all the commotion and being blind he
[43:34] said would someone please tell me what's
[43:36] going on
[43:38] some kind soul said it's jesus of
[43:41] nazareth the lamb of god he's come and
[43:44] when blind bartimaeus heard that the
[43:46] lamb
[43:47] the lamb the provided way he began to
[43:50] cry out to jesus jesus thou son of david
[43:54] have mercy on me
[43:56] and someone said hey hold your peace we
[43:58] don't like none of that shouting around
[44:00] here
[44:01] if we like what's being said we just nod
[44:03] our head and if it's really good we just
[44:05] raise a hand
[44:09] hey there's something every time you
[44:11] hey there's something every time you
[44:13] make a move towards god there's always
[44:14] somebody there to stop you young people
[44:18] someone said hey hold your peace but the
[44:21] bible said he cried the louder
[44:25] and jesus
[44:27] stood still
[44:28] you see it wasn't his voice that stopped
[44:30] jesus there's more than 150 yards away
[44:33] and all the commotion he would have
[44:35] never heard his voice
[44:37] it wasn't blind bartimaeus's voice that
[44:39] stopped jesus it was his faith that
[44:42] stopped jesus and if his faith can stop
[44:44] jesus your faith can stop him this
[44:46] morning
[44:48] [Music]
[44:50] jesus
[44:51] stood still
[44:52] and they said be of good cheer
[44:55] he stopped
[44:56] and he's calling
[44:58] for you
[45:00] now blonde barnabas is left with this
[45:02] decision that every one of you is left
[45:04] with this morning
[45:07] he's left with this decision either sit
[45:09] still on this rock
[45:12] or get up
[45:14] and go meet jesus
[45:18] he was left with the decision jesus had
[45:20] stopped
[45:22] and was calling for him now he has to
[45:25] make the next move
[45:28] so i'm waiting on god maybe he's waiting
[45:30] on you
[45:35] so the bible says in verse 50 that he
[45:38] casting away his garment rose and came
[45:42] to jesus
[45:43] he got up and went to meet jesus
[45:47] casting off that old blind beggar's robe
[45:49] i'm not going to need it anymore
[45:53] notice when did he cast off that blood
[45:55] see in those days that the beggars wore
[45:58] a different robe that identified what
[45:59] they were a paralytic or a blindness or
[46:02] or leprosy or whatever they wore a robe
[46:05] that identified their disease so when
[46:07] you saw the robe you knew this man was
[46:09] blind by the robe that he wore but
[46:11] notice before he ever got to jesus he
[46:14] threw off the blind beggar's robe
[46:16] because he said i don't need it no more
[46:20] i've got a lamb
[46:21] i've got a lamb provided for my husband
[46:28] can you see
[46:29] what he saw
[46:32] he was blind as blind can be and yet he
[46:35] sees more than 99 of people sitting on
[46:38] church views
[46:42] he saw
[46:44] a lamb
[46:45] provided
[46:48] amen
[46:49] and i say to you this morning can you
[46:50] rise up and step towards the promised
[46:52] word for your day
[46:54] cast off the fear cast off the asthma
[46:57] cast off the high blood pressure cast
[46:59] off the back trouble i don't need an
[47:01] arthritis robe i don't need a depression
[47:03] roll i don't need a glaucoma robe
[47:05] hallelujah i've got a love provided for
[47:08] everything
[47:16] god's
[47:17] provided way for us the prophet said
[47:19] that was god's provided way was to go
[47:21] meet jesus that's right you got sorrow
[47:23] in your home
[47:25] go meet jesus
[47:26] got sickness in your home
[47:28] go meet jesus got covered in your home
[47:31] he didn't say that i did go meet jesus
[47:34] got heartache in your home go meet jesus
[47:37] hallelujah if you've got a need for
[47:40] anything
[47:42] go
[47:43] meet
[47:44] jesus
[47:45] go meet him he's got all the remedy and
[47:47] then the prophet says he's got all the
[47:49] remedy everything there is and then he
[47:50] says he ain't got the remedy
[47:53] he's got the cure
[47:57] he's got the cure for anything we have
[48:01] need of this morning
[48:04] then if that's true
[48:05] why are so many people sick
[48:07] why are so many people depressed why are
[48:10] so many people so beaten down they can't
[48:12] even say amen in church
[48:16] is the word wrong
[48:18] or are we wrong
[48:20] are we living beneath our privilege
[48:24] have we let our problems get bigger than
[48:26] our god
[48:28] well glory
[48:31] you see if god provided a way for us to
[48:33] go meet jesus
[48:35] then there has to be a way for us to do
[48:37] that
[48:39] god ain't no indian giver
[48:42] god ain't going to tell you something
[48:43] that he can't produce
[48:45] he would have never told us to get up
[48:46] and go meet jesus through his prophet if
[48:49] there wasn't a way for us to do that
[48:53] so if god anointed his prophet to tell
[48:56] us if you've got a need for anything go
[48:58] meet jesus then there has to be a way
[49:01] for us to do that
[49:03] in this day that we're living in you see
[49:06] in order to meet him
[49:08] you got to know where he's at
[49:11] if i told you meet me tomorrow
[49:15] and i'll buy you the biggest steak in
[49:17] lula georgia
[49:19] what's the next thing you're going to
[49:20] say
[49:22] we're at
[49:25] that is if you want a steak
[49:28] you see what i'm saying so if we've been
[49:30] given instructions to go meet him you've
[49:32] got to know where he's at
[49:35] you see he said in a little while the
[49:37] world will see me no more amen but you
[49:43] but you
[49:45] who's he talking to
[49:46] you
[49:48] but you shall see me
[49:52] how lord
[49:54] how
[49:55] will i see you
[49:57] you see if there's a big biblical
[49:59] question there's got to be a biblical
[50:01] answer and jesus said the world won't
[50:03] see you no more but you shall not could
[50:06] be not hope so not maybe but you shall
[50:09] see
[50:10] me how
[50:14] how will i see you
[50:17] then he answers it for i'll be with you
[50:20] even
[50:22] where
[50:24] in your
[50:26] for i'll be with you even in you yes
[50:30] then where's he at
[50:32] he's right here with us hell
[50:35] oh god open our eyes and let's see he's
[50:38] here it's not somewhere someday some
[50:42] happy day no that day is today amen
[50:46] you say we want to see jesus how many
[50:48] wants to see him
[50:50] then you can only see him in the
[50:52] manifestation of his word that is
[50:55] promised in the hour you're living in
[50:58] you see if that door opened back there
[51:00] and somebody come up this aisle dragging
[51:02] across bleeding everywhere a crown of
[51:04] thorns on his head women would scream
[51:06] men would faint and that wouldn't even
[51:08] be jesus
[51:10] i'm sorry
[51:11] he never promised to come like that in
[51:14] this hour he's already done that
[51:18] come on somebody i'm going to preach for
[51:19] an hour whether you're with me or not
[51:22] that would not be jesus and yet people
[51:25] would rely more on that than the reality
[51:27] of the word that's promised for this
[51:29] hour
[51:30] you've got to see the word for your day
[51:32] if you see the word for your day
[51:34] manifested you have seen jesus for he is
[51:37] the word amen
[51:42] hallelujah
[51:46] hallelujah
[51:47] jesus said i'm the vine
[51:50] you're the branches
[51:52] therefore the only way god could speak
[51:54] this morning would be through my lips
[51:56] your lips
[51:58] my hands your hands my life your life
[52:01] i'm the vine you are the branch yes
[52:04] he doesn't bear fruit anymore he just
[52:07] purges his church and the church bears
[52:10] fruit then what kind of fruit would it
[52:12] bear the life that was in him would be
[52:15] in his church
[52:17] making him the same yesterday today and
[52:20] forever
[52:21] it'll bear the same kind of life that he
[52:23] bore when he was here amen
[52:26] hallelujah
[52:27] hallelujah amen the vine cannot bear the
[52:30] fruit it's the branch that bears the
[52:32] fruit as it's energized from the vine
[52:35] and christ is our energy
[52:38] your lips is his lips when you're
[52:40] energized your hands is his hands
[52:43] when you're energized from the life
[52:46] of the vine
[52:48] your hands
[52:49] it's his hands
[52:51] i was in nicaragua a few years ago place
[52:53] how far i don't know if brother lewis
[52:55] louise was there with us that year or
[52:57] not
[52:59] right at the end of the service it was
[53:00] going to have a prayer line that night
[53:01] but there was just so many people i
[53:03] thought we'd be there for hours and so i
[53:04] said we'll just have one mass prayer for
[53:07] everybody in the building so i told the
[53:08] people just lay hands on one another and
[53:10] the pulpit was the kind a little bit i
[53:12] was elevated off the floor and so just
[53:14] as i told the person lay hands on
[53:15] another we'll just have one mass prayer
[53:17] and just as i started to bow my head to
[53:19] pray i looked back at about halfway back
[53:21] on the end was a sister
[53:24] and something spoke to my heart and said
[53:26] go lay your hands on her so i jumped off
[53:29] the platform and started walking back
[53:30] and when i hadn't started praying people
[53:32] would started peeking you know to see
[53:33] why i hadn't started praying
[53:36] and when i got back to where the sister
[53:37] was she had her hand up in the air i
[53:39] just reached up and grabbed a hold of
[53:40] her hand and we began to pray
[53:42] and when the service was over the sister
[53:44] said can i speak to you and it's through
[53:46] danny torres he he helps me when i go to
[53:48] their interprets for me so brother danny
[53:50] was interpreted and i said yes ma'am
[53:52] and she said tonight when you've told
[53:54] the people to lay hands on one another
[53:56] to pray she said nobody laid hands on me
[54:00] and she said i thought what's wrong with
[54:02] me
[54:04] that nobody
[54:05] would want to pray for me
[54:07] and she said i began to cry i said lord
[54:10] why won't nobody lay their hand on me
[54:13] and she said i no sooner said that then
[54:15] a voice spoke and said i'll lay my hand
[54:18] on you and she said that voice no sooner
[54:21] spoke then you put your hand in my hand
[54:24] now am i jesus of course not
[54:27] but it was my hand he used to touch her
[54:30] and it's your hand he'll use to touch
[54:32] your husband to touch your wife to touch
[54:34] your brother to touch your sister to
[54:36] touch your daughter come on somebody
[54:38] your hand is his head when you're
[54:40] energized your lips is head lips when
[54:42] you're energized from the life of the
[54:45] vine you see his ministry his ministry
[54:48] is in his bride which is his body

[54:59] question answers the seals the bride

[55:06] his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of
[55:09] his spirit then where is he
[55:11] he's right here with us
[55:14] now

[55:34] have to work to go the gas station
[55:38] so i was somewhere preaching and i
[55:39] stopped to get some gas went in to get
[55:41] me some chips that's why i look the way
[55:43] i do cokes and chips
[55:46] and i was standing there by the potato
[55:47] chip rack
[55:50] and this guy comes walking in with a
[55:51] mask and he must have been a local
[55:54] because when he walked in the cashier

[56:02] and when she said that just something
[56:05] struck my how about shouted past the
[56:07] coca-cola

[56:10] that's right remember the prophet of god
[56:12] talked about the play where that one guy
[56:14] had three different parts and he would
[56:15] go back chase and change his costume and
[56:17] come out it was the same guy all the
[56:20] time he just changed his costume and
[56:22] don't you see the god that dwelled
[56:24] behind the mask of jesus that saint god

[56:54] minutes
[56:56] jesus speaking to martha in 11 23 jesus
[56:59] said unto her martha thy brother shall
[57:01] rise again and martha said unto him i
[57:03] know he shall rise again in the
[57:05] resurrection at the last day and jesus
[57:07] said unto her i am the resurrection in
[57:10] the life and he that believeth in me
[57:11] though he were dead yet shall he live
[57:13] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[57:14] shall never die believe us thou this

[57:25] believe
[57:27] i believe that thou art the christ the
[57:30] son of god which should come into the
[57:32] world

[57:37] she went her way
[57:39] and called mary her sister

[58:37] tears sitting there all depressed
[58:39] sitting there all discouraged standing
[58:42] there all tore up her life upside down
[58:44] and martha goes to mary secretly
[58:48] saying the master has come and he's
[58:50] calling
[58:51] for thee
[58:54] and the bible said as soon as mary heard
[58:58] that
[58:59] she arose quickly
[59:01] and came
[59:02] unto him
[59:08] you see martha the church the woman
[59:11] types the church

[1:07:29] don't you i love to sit and listen to
[1:07:31] those things
[1:07:32] herbert say just yesterday i think it
[1:07:34] was that he called a man out that was
[1:07:36] blind and god opened i know the man was
[1:07:38] deaf and god opened the man's deaf ears
[1:07:40] and the man spoke you know he's
[1:07:41] beginning to talk back to brother
[1:07:42] branham and he got ready to leave the
[1:07:44] platform and brother ben said wait a
[1:07:45] minute you got a problem in your life
[1:07:47] it's cigarettes
[1:07:49] and i thought the grace of god
[1:07:51] wouldn't be no good to tell him that if
[1:07:52] he couldn't hear it but god waited till
[1:07:54] he opened his ears and then told him
[1:07:58] i love to hear those things
[1:08:00] don't you i love to listen to the
[1:08:01] discernment you're so and so from a
[1:08:02] certain certain city i looked up the
[1:08:04] other day brother ben called somebody
[1:08:05] out told him the house number of their
[1:08:07] house and the street number and the city
[1:08:09] and you know what i did i googled it
[1:08:12] it's still there matter of fact it's for
[1:08:14] sale if you want to buy it
[1:08:18] and i thought that's the grace of god

[1:08:23] apartment 2 15 and a half

[1:08:31] that's god i love to hear those things
[1:08:33] but i'm so thankful that i don't have to
[1:08:36] go back to 1965
[1:08:38] and see what god done but the same god
[1:08:41] that done that through the prophet is
[1:08:43] doing it today through his bribe
[1:08:47] amen
[1:08:49] he's doing it right now working through
[1:08:51] his body on the earth making saint john
[1:08:53] 14 12 a reality verily verily i say unto
[1:08:56] you the works i do share you do also and
[1:08:59] greater more works than this shall you
[1:09:01] do
[1:09:03] more works

[1:09:06] the works now today it's a mini-membered
[1:09:09] body all around the world
[1:09:12] that christ is manifesting himself
[1:09:14] making himself the same yesterday today
[1:09:17] and forever

[1:09:21] to 1965
[1:09:25] to see what god does
[1:09:27] but that same god
[1:09:29] is doing it today
