[16:32] sorry sorry about that sorry
[16:35] and um good to have them with us and uh
[16:38] you live in Oklahoma I know all about
[16:40] you guys you live in Oklahoma you live
[16:42] in you used to live in the Philippines
[16:46] we have some brothers that uh and sister
[16:49] that's from the Philippines too so good
[16:50] to have them with us today good to make
[16:52] stuff at home and we we love everybody
[16:55] with the love of the Lord
[16:57] and we'll start making announcements
[17:00] um here in just a second but if you want
[17:02] to have your seats brother Ryan come up
[17:04] here
[17:09] he wore red
[17:12] come stand right here
[17:16] several months ago it's been a while you
[17:18] know come over here and get closer to me
[17:22] on camera
[17:24] several months we um we were don't fall
[17:28] several months ago we approached brother
[17:32] Ryan about being a deacon and uh he
[17:36] thought about it and then as brother
[17:37] Terence announced Sunday he said yes and
[17:41] um
[17:42] so according to brother Branham you know
[17:44] we were supposed to announce it and then
[17:46] then you vet him let him see if and you
[17:48] got to see if you want to be of that or
[17:50] not because the Deacon's office is an
[17:52] office that's very it's important
[17:55] it's it's it's solemn we last night if
[17:57] you weren't into Bible study we read the
[18:00] offices of the of the people in the
[18:02] church the pastor assist the pastor
[18:04] deacons and all that and this scriptures
[18:07] we're going to read the trustees and all
[18:09] the different ones we talked about last
[18:10] night so brother Ryan has said yes that
[18:13] he would like to be considered to be a
[18:15] deacon so I'm going to read the offices
[18:17] of the deacon and what they are required
[18:20] to do
[18:21] as we were talking last night the Deacon
[18:23] has a little more requirement than a
[18:25] than a pastor does because the pastor or
[18:28] preacher
[18:29] can can be not married
[18:33] um and be a pastor because hey Apostle
[18:35] Paul was never married right so but now
[18:38] a deacon uh brother random we read last
[18:41] night's they brought somebody's name for
[18:43] it to be a deacon he said he'd make a
[18:45] real good one said but he's not married
[18:47] so that disqualifies him from being a
[18:49] deacon so we've all known brother Ryan
[18:52] as we said before uh he used to ride
[18:54] with us to Fellowship meetings be sick
[18:57] as a dog in the back in the back of that
[18:59] van because we were going around you
[19:00] know mountain roads and and he had to
[19:03] ride up front with us sometimes but you
[19:04] know what he was faithful
[19:06] and then then he disappeared for a
[19:08] little while and he brought Gabby back
[19:10] with him so uh now there have four
[19:13] children
[19:15] girls
[19:19] only girls okay
[19:22] so and there and to me they're just a
[19:25] wonderful household they're a
[19:27] representation of a true family
[19:30] um and and a representation of a father
[19:32] figure in that family and then we now as
[19:36] the Church of of uh Spoken Word Church
[19:39] in Lula Georgia we're going to ordain
[19:42] our brother according to what brother
[19:43] Brown said let me read first Timothy
[19:45] Timothy 3 verse 8. it says likewise must
[19:48] a deacon be grave not double tongue not
[19:51] given to much wine not greedy of filthy
[19:53] looker holding the mystery of the faith
[19:55] and the pure conscience and let these
[19:58] also first be proved then let them use
[20:01] the office of a deacon being found
[20:03] blameless even so must their wives be
[20:06] grave not slander or sober faithful in
[20:09] all things let the Deacon be the husband
[20:11] one wife ruin their children in their
[20:13] house well
[20:14] for they that have used the office of a
[20:17] deacon well purchased to themself a good
[20:20] degree wow
[20:22] and great boldness in the faith
[20:25] which is in Jesus Christ
[20:27] and I'm going to read the office that we
[20:29] have if you ever want to know anything
[20:30] about the officers there's a it's on the
[20:33] wall right there in the in the pastor
[20:35] study that you can read the different
[20:37] qualifications all right the Deacon in
[20:39] this church they must meet the spiritual
[20:41] qualifications according to First
[20:42] Timothy 3 verse 8 and he does meet those
[20:44] qualities their duties should be to
[20:46] assist the pastor in all the ways in
[20:48] which he shall direct such as acting as
[20:50] ushers receiving offering assisting with
[20:52] water baptism communion and praying for
[20:54] the sick and brother Ryan once goes on
[20:57] further and tells us that they are the
[20:58] what the policeman of the church
[21:00] the deacons are the policemen they they
[21:03] are here to number one uphold
[21:07] the ministry of this church
[21:11] right
[21:12] and then police that and make sure that
[21:14] that's carried out in the church in a
[21:17] Godly manner in a Godly manner
[21:20] and and then if there's any problems or
[21:22] issues you're going to have to work out
[21:24] a little bit because you got to get
[21:25] bigger
[21:27] if a big old guy comes through that door
[21:29] right there you got to run up and jump
[21:30] on him
[21:32] you making you hit him with a drum hit
[21:34] him with a drumstick
[21:37] yeah brother round we talked about last
[21:39] night that was a a man came in and shot
[21:41] some shot a minister I shot the preacher
[21:44] and he said if the deacons would have
[21:45] been there and done their job they would
[21:46] have rattled him down before he got the
[21:48] gun out so but that's what you're to do
[21:50] you're to do that you're to go by the
[21:52] book there in Timothy and then uphold
[21:55] the doctrine of this church brother
[21:58] Brown uh they asked him one time said
[21:59] should a deacon uh be in other words one
[22:02] with the doctrine of the church he said
[22:03] if he's not he needs to be voted out
[22:06] because you're the one that you're not
[22:08] you know policemen they don't make the
[22:10] laws
[22:11] they enforce the loss
[22:13] all right so you're you're to enforce
[22:15] the laws of this church and then now is
[22:18] uh if you'll turn around this way
[22:21] there
[22:22] everybody bow your head
[22:24] do not look up
[22:25] does everybody find brother Ryan Bonnet
[22:28] to be worthy
[22:29] and able to do his job as a deacon by
[22:33] the raising of your hand
[22:38] okay all right thank you very much
[22:40] all right you can turn around brother
[22:42] Terence uh brother Bob dad
[22:45] would you come up here we're gonna pray
[22:46] over brother Ryan
[22:48] and welcome him into the into the Deacon
[22:51] ship of the of the church

[23:04] job

[23:09] brother Aaron come on up here too we'll
[23:11] get the ministers involved this is the
[23:13] ministry and the deacons of the church

[24:22] that he is Lord a born-again Christian
[24:25] because of his life Lord

[31:47] just give us Lord something that we can
[31:49] carry on in life with Lord just be with
[31:52] us in the furtherness service in Jesus
[31:54] name we pray amen the Bible says in the
[31:57] beginning was the word the word was with
[31:58] God and the Word was God and the Word
[32:01] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now as
[32:04] we've been speaking and for some of the
[32:05] ones that have been here that was Jesus
[32:08] Christ
[32:09] the first time he did it now it's the
[32:12] word made flesh in me and you
[32:13] all right so and the Word was made flesh
[32:16] and dwelt among us and we behold his
[32:18] glory the glory the only begotten of the
[32:20] father full of grace and truth you may
[32:21] be seated the Lord has blessing to the
[32:23] reading of the word someone asked last
[32:25] night about what is a seed well that's
[32:27] the seed is not just a little seed like
[32:29] this the seed is the word of God
[32:32] so in the beginning was the seed
[32:35] and that seed was made flesh and dwelt
[32:38] among us and what were you you were an
[32:40] old Sinner and God raised you up out of
[32:44] that gave you the seed word of God and
[32:48] now we what we live by that we love it
[32:51] we love Revelation as we're going to
[32:53] talk about here in just a little bit
[32:54] brother Robin talks about Revelation
[32:56] being what there's no greater power
[32:58] there's no prevailing power as a
[33:00] revelation all right so what we thrive
[33:03] on that see yesterday altar in the Bible
[33:06] study I we thrive on Revelation
[33:08] everybody's like oh man this you know
[33:09] we're all back and forth and and we were
[33:12] there was something going on about what
[33:14] was it Aaron so brother Aaron's in the
[33:16] back room and he's nobody knows he's
[33:17] back there
[33:18] and I we said something about angels and
[33:21] we'll read it today talk about judging
[33:23] angels and he be brought the scripture
[33:25] out in Jude about that because somebody
[33:27] had a question is how do we judge Angels
[33:29] if they're perfect well the angels are
[33:31] not perfect the ones that fail anyway
[33:33] because they what they fail
[33:34] all right so they're gonna have to be
[33:36] judged according to Jude so there's an
[33:39] answer for everything
[33:40] there is a Bible question brother Ryan
[33:42] said there's a Bible answer so we have
[33:45] and and brother Brian tells us he says
[33:47] we have Satan's answer because we don't
[33:49] want to go around being confused we
[33:51] don't go around having a bunch of
[33:52] questions in our mind what about this
[33:54] what about that what about this number
[33:55] one you got to establish is is this is
[33:57] right the Bible's right that's the
[34:00] absolute we can read other books
[34:01] self-help and all these other things
[34:02] that's okay but the Bible is our
[34:04] absolute
[34:06] that's what brother Ram said he says
[34:07] faith final resting places where in the
[34:09] word of God
[34:11] all right in the word of God is where we
[34:13] got to go back to
[34:14] John 8 verse 31 says slow down Jesus
[34:19] said to those Jews that believed on him
[34:21] if you continue my word then you are my
[34:23] disciples indeed and what and you shall
[34:25] know
[34:26] the truth
[34:28] not know of it
[34:30] you shall know the truth and that truth
[34:33] will do something in your life it will
[34:36] set you free if you know about the truth
[34:38] that will not set you free but if you
[34:41] know the truth because who is the truth
[34:43] Jesus said I am the what the way the
[34:45] truth and the life all right so we got
[34:48] to put it back into that perspective
[34:49] that Jesus Christ is the one we're
[34:51] looking at because he's the perfect one
[34:52] and then now that perfect one lives in
[34:54] me and you and he gives us officers as
[34:56] we were talking about last night in
[34:57] about just a few minutes ago with other
[34:59] Ryan different ones he gives us officers
[35:01] that he works through he works do a fine
[35:04] fold Ministry not one this is not a
[35:06] one-fold it's not a one-man job
[35:08] amen it was at a time brother Branham
[35:11] was he was the one that would come with
[35:13] a gift with a prophetic gift to bring us
[35:16] prophecy to bring us more clarity to the
[35:19] word of God and now he went off the
[35:20] scene and he gave it to what Ephesians 4
[35:23] 12 Apostles prophets pastors teachers
[35:25] and evangelists for what your perfection
[35:27] in mind for all of our Perfection for
[35:30] the perfecting of the Saints
[35:32] so we believe in that we believe that
[35:34] you can't get perfected you can't go up
[35:36] this stack to a perfect man without
[35:38] somebody teaching you Paul says
[35:41] we need a teacher according to the book
[35:44] of Galatians we need a school Master to
[35:45] bring us to Christ we need somebody to
[35:47] be able to explain the things that's why
[35:50] we Bible study we had seven or eight
[35:51] different questions and they were kind
[35:52] of scattered around in different places
[35:54] and we tried our best to answer all
[35:56] those questions but they were questions
[35:59] someone had a question in their heart
[36:02] that's why I believe that we
[36:05] are stronger by questions as people
[36:09] asking questions
[36:10] II Peter 1 verse 5 says beside this
[36:12] giving all diligence that's where we've
[36:14] been now on the Statue of perfect man
[36:15] act to your faith virtue virtue
[36:18] knowledge your knowledge Temperance and
[36:20] to Temperance patience and patience
[36:22] godliness now we're at knowledge we're
[36:24] going to try to get to Temperance but if
[36:26] you would pull that chart up just for a
[36:28] moment
[36:29] well we can see this is you this is the
[36:31] person this is you that your your daily
[36:34] life what your life is as a Christian
[36:37] what is going to and to me having the
[36:41] knowledge of God tells us how to work
[36:43] these things out like last night if that
[36:46] was a question there's not 17 different
[36:48] answers to a true Bible question there's
[36:50] only one answer
[36:53] and if you have a question on the Bible
[36:55] question go back to the prophet's
[36:56] message and let him clarify what what
[36:59] the the message said in the Bible all
[37:02] right so because remember he said it was
[37:04] the Love Letter it was the in between is
[37:07] what we have to read to get a revelation
[37:09] so uh that's okay if I can't find the
[37:12] chart that's fine but I want to go back
[37:14] just a step
[37:16] the Bible says add to your faith now
[37:19] what is your faith your faith is the new
[37:21] birth
[37:22] add to your new birth
[37:24] virtue now you say well I don't need it
[37:29] why'd the bible say that
[37:32] if you didn't need it if you got
[37:34] everything you needed and you do get
[37:35] everything you need
[37:37] you got every brain cell you need some
[37:39] of us lacking some of us has more that's
[37:41] okay but you have brain cells the same
[37:44] brain cells you have when you're a a
[37:47] kindergartner is the same brain cells
[37:48] you got when you're a 12th grade and you
[37:51] go up into college same brain it's just
[37:53] what develop more you've not added parts
[37:56] to your body to make you stronger or
[37:58] different if you were a baby you had all
[38:00] your parts same way with being born
[38:02] again when you were born again you had
[38:03] all your parts to be able to become an
[38:06] adult they're by with me we can look at
[38:09] nature and see exactly the way
[38:10] Christianity that's why it's so it's so
[38:13] easy for us to see how that God deals
[38:16] with people
[38:17] and as we were talking about last night
[38:19] listen God wrote this Bible so that we
[38:22] can understand it he didn't write this
[38:23] Bible so he could confuse us now he
[38:24] confused them but he wrote this Bible so
[38:27] that you and I could not be confused
[38:30] well I don't know if he he should have
[38:32] wrote it a different well you're not God
[38:35] he's God and he knows everything he
[38:38] knows exactly that 66 books of the Bible
[38:40] and ever how many chapters ever how many
[38:42] verses that's exactly how much men you
[38:44] need to get out of here with
[38:46] then he sent us the message of the hour
[38:48] to fill in all the gaps to answer all
[38:50] the questions so that we can go further
[38:52] so we can what add
[38:54] to your now look add to your new birth
[38:58] add to your faith in other words you
[39:00] have the faith is yours now once you're
[39:03] born again that faith is yours and then
[39:05] you've got to add to that and that word
[39:08] add remember we looked at it several
[39:10] months ago we've been on this for you
[39:11] know eight months
[39:12] but add to your faith that word add in
[39:15] the Greek Lexicon is Minister
[39:18] so minister to your new birth
[39:22] well I got it brother I understand at
[39:23] home yeah you didn't get it
[39:29] can be quiet if you want to
[39:32] you didn't get it
[39:35] add to your new birth
[39:37] as we were talking last night
[39:40] listen you're born again experience
[39:42] somebody asked about you know the
[39:43] characteristics of them you're born
[39:45] again experience is not going to make
[39:46] your life just be some bubble dance no
[39:49] Satan's gonna turn every gun on you and
[39:51] you're going to have troubles and trials
[39:52] but you're gonna know how to do that
[39:54] you're going to know how to get through
[39:56] that it is a testimony what's the first
[39:58] four letters of that t-e-s-t you got to
[40:01] go through a test before you get a
[40:03] testimony all right so your test is if
[40:06] Satan says oh you didn't get it you
[40:07] didn't get it because you're you're
[40:08] thinking wrong well no that ain't got
[40:11] anything to do with it
[40:14] oh I'm sorry y'all don't think wrong am
[40:17] I in the right crowd
[40:19] well I told him pray for me then because
[40:22] I have them if you don't then pray for
[40:24] me
[40:25] so now who else had bad thoughts
[40:28] thank you all right
[40:30] some of you are still thinking about
[40:32] those bad thoughts
[40:34] but that word add means to minister so
[40:36] we get we get born again the word of God
[40:38] is alive in our heart
[40:41] and as mom was saying last night when we
[40:43] say heart you know you've been taught
[40:45] long enough when we say heart that means
[40:46] soul that doesn't mean
[40:48] that thing okay the heart of a man we
[40:51] read that the the definition of that a
[40:54] long long time ago but this is your soul
[40:56] this is your spirit and this is your
[40:57] body so in your soul is what either
[41:00] Faith or doubt you either got the devil
[41:02] inside of you today or you got God
[41:04] inside of you today there is no gray
[41:05] area there is no in between
[41:08] yeah about with me and you know what
[41:09] you're going to express that out because
[41:12] the soul is the nature of the spirit the
[41:15] soul is going to emanate out into your
[41:18] memory reason conscious affection
[41:19] imagination and you are going to do the
[41:22] things that that inside God tells you to
[41:24] do
[41:25] I don't know about you but when I was a
[41:27] Devil's Child I did what the devil did
[41:29] now that I'm a Child of God it's still
[41:32] hard to do what God tells you to do but
[41:34] at least you've got something inside
[41:35] you've got an anchor you got a Rudder
[41:37] you got something to they'll tell you no
[41:39] you don't need to do that anymore or
[41:41] turn your head don't it wasn't it wasn't
[41:43] hard for me to go into a beer store
[41:46] when I was BC before Christ right
[41:50] because that was what was inside of me
[41:51] that's what emanated out it didn't
[41:53] bother me
[41:55] don't go now I don't want to the want to
[41:58] got pulled out of me same thing with all
[42:00] when we look in the Book of Luke the
[42:02] unclean Spirit goes out of a man out
[42:06] there he is out
[42:09] some of them kicking and screaming
[42:15] well what do they do though
[42:18] they go out
[42:20] and then they come back and if you
[42:21] haven't got that thing sealed with the
[42:23] holy ghost seven more demons worse than
[42:26] the one that left you is gonna come back
[42:28] and make you very religious
[42:30] and you're going to sit in a messy
[42:32] church and die
[42:35] brother Brown said that's where the
[42:36] quote comes from Brother Adam said you
[42:37] can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[42:40] every day of your life on your spirit
[42:42] and die and go to hell because your
[42:45] Soul's not redeemed
[42:47] your soul is still the devil until it's
[42:49] redeemed that's why it's called
[42:50] Redemption he purchased that he
[42:54] purchased that whole guy but he had to
[42:56] start on the inside guy because there's
[42:58] the faith or doubt then you go out in
[42:59] the spirit realm the spirit realm has
[43:01] what memory reason conscious infection
[43:03] imagination now if God's inside there
[43:05] he's working his way out if Satan's in
[43:07] there he's working his way out but what
[43:09] Satan is doing though Satan is now
[43:11] bombarding this way to a Christian
[43:13] that's why we still have problems we
[43:15] still have issues that's why the Bible
[43:17] says add
[43:19] our minister to your new birth
[43:22] listen prophet of God tells us you can't
[43:25] wait for these doors to be opened to
[43:28] come to church I don't know why you
[43:29] don't understand that
[43:31] because it's a desire
[43:33] it's something that pulls me here
[43:36] it's not something if it's drudgery you
[43:38] need to head out that door or come to
[43:39] the altar one of the two
[43:41] right because you're going to either
[43:42] come in better or worse now that's what
[43:44] and I can understand that more I used to
[43:45] think about that quote and I thought man
[43:47] I don't know how that is I know what it
[43:49] is now
[43:50] if I come in that door with something
[43:52] and I don't get rid of it and I go out
[43:54] back out that door it makes me worse
[43:57] but if I get rid of it while I'm in here
[44:02] I'm a lot better when I go out that door
[44:05] so are you
[44:07] so add to your new birth
[44:09] virtue
[44:11] add to your new birth knowledge as I
[44:14] said before last Wednesday night that
[44:16] knowledge is not the knowledge of Acts 2
[44:19] 38.
[44:24] it's not the knowledge that the message
[44:26] is right that's down there where it says
[44:28] add to your faith because your new birth
[44:31] is going to take you to the message of
[44:33] the hour eventually you may not you may
[44:36] have got born again out in the world or
[44:37] you may I mean I don't know the world
[44:39] without another denomination but where
[44:40] are you sitting today
[44:42] who are you saying today
[44:44] you're sitting here you're believing no
[44:46] a message of the hour
[44:48] so add or Minister look Minister what
[44:51] nourishment
[44:54] Minister nourishment
[44:56] to supply furnish that's what these
[44:58] virtues are for it's to furnish you
[45:01] it's wonderful to have a house
[45:04] a couple of you have got new houses
[45:08] she never had Furniture in them what
[45:10] kind of house is it
[45:12] well this is my beautiful home Where'd I
[45:14] say it I'll just sit on the floor
[45:16] no you furnish that house
[45:20] you bring in a stove and a refrigerator
[45:23] and a and a uh a chair and a recliner
[45:27] and a real good recliner too
[45:30] well then you mash the button and goes
[45:33] [Music]
[45:35] heater turns on
[45:37] well I'd always be the same way with the
[45:39] word of God you want the best today ask
[45:42] for a real good recliner
[45:44] to furnish your house
[45:46] to be supplied Minister unto or assisted
[45:49] you and I have come to this church to
[45:51] what to be assisted in our new birth
[45:55] to give assistance to what you need
[45:57] because you're not going to get it out
[45:58] there
[45:59] you're going to get it in here this is
[46:01] this is the place where you fill up yes
[46:03] yes this is where you get your fuel for
[46:05] tomorrow or the next day or the next day
[46:07] but the supply
[46:10] so add to your new birth so from now
[46:13] we're going to say add to your new birth
[46:15] instead of adding to your faith add to
[46:17] your new birth or minister to your new
[46:20] birth because today either you got faith
[46:22] or doubt now I am ministering to your
[46:25] faith
[46:26] or I'm ministering to your doubt you're
[46:28] saying I don't have to do that I don't
[46:29] understand this I don't understand that
[46:31] that's okay if you do that don't stay
[46:33] that way though add
[46:35] the new birth
[46:37] then add to that new birth minister to
[46:40] it I love to hear ministers preach
[46:44] come on
[46:46] that's where I get my
[46:51] number not when I'm told to
[46:55] why do we get in this shape
[46:58] because there was a a bug that eat
[47:00] everything down
[47:03] even in the Statue of perfect man
[47:06] they had these virtues in the first
[47:08] church right
[47:10] background a little bit just bear with
[47:12] me they had these virtues in the first
[47:14] church age they were working in their
[47:16] life Silver and Gold Have I None but
[47:18] what I have combined to thee rise up and
[47:20] walk uh by their Shadow Paul had had
[47:24] pieces of his garments laid on people
[47:26] that's why we have prayer cloths that's
[47:28] where we get that from we take prayer
[47:29] cloths we anoint them will you play it
[47:31] on a set we've seen cancer healed we've
[47:33] seen diabetes we've seen all kind of
[47:35] healings just by taking these and giving
[47:38] them to people brother Danny on the back
[47:39] road back there he keeps going around
[47:40] with him all the time and don't worry if
[47:43] he gets frayed don't worry if you wash
[47:44] it you're not gonna wash the anointing
[47:45] off of it I keep them in my Bible I keep
[47:48] them in my billfold we got them over the
[47:49] door you can see there's one right there
[47:51] over that door there's one back there
[47:53] over that door what that's protection
[47:55] that's for us to look at as Paul was We
[47:58] Believe Paul was a messenger remember we
[48:00] believe Paul had the Holy Ghost
[48:02] all right
[48:04] so then the anointing according to the
[48:06] Bible was that they took cloth off of
[48:09] Paul and give them to the to the people
[48:10] all right and then Jesus was touched on
[48:13] the Hem of His Garment
[48:16] all right so that's what we guess not
[48:17] Hocus Pocus and it's not something like
[48:20] Catholicism where you got to light a
[48:22] candle and you got to do it no now it's
[48:24] the word of God
[48:25] and I believe those I believed when
[48:28] those things are placed on you and I
[48:29] don't have to explain to a lot of you
[48:31] what it's for but it is for us to
[48:34] believe what's already been preached to
[48:36] us all right so Joel says I will restore
[48:40] so we're going to have a restoration of
[48:42] as I was reading last night brother
[48:44] Brown talks about the restoration of
[48:45] gifts when the restoration of gifts
[48:47] comes there's a restoration of power
[48:49] that was speaking in tongues it was all
[48:50] these gifts but brother Brown said the
[48:52] problem with them was Pentecost they
[48:54] stayed there
[48:56] they honed in on the gifts and said you
[48:58] got to be speaking in tongues to get the
[49:00] Holy Ghost the prophet of God said no
[49:02] God what God added
[49:05] God added to some people's New Birth and
[49:09] they moved on
[49:11] right that's the same way with me and
[49:12] you
[49:13] we can't stand still we got to either
[49:15] move forward or backwards one of the two
[49:17] but I will restore to you
[49:19] the years that the locusts eat the
[49:21] canker worm caterpillar Palmer worm my
[49:23] great Army which I sent among you and
[49:26] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[49:28] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[49:30] that hath dealt wondrously with you and
[49:32] my people shall never be ashamed now on
[49:35] the restoration of bribetary I kind of
[49:36] picked this up I wanted to read this
[49:38] brother that was kind of covering a
[49:39] little bit last night and um and if
[49:42] you'll understand that that this whole
[49:44] thing's in a loop
[49:46] everybody with me this whole thing's in
[49:48] a loop
[49:50] and if you'll read
[49:51] um an Intervale brother Brown goes to
[49:53] outer Court intercourt holy of holies
[49:55] and then all of a sudden you're back out
[49:57] here under justification again so we
[49:59] believe in this church and preach it
[50:01] that brother REM did too that there's
[50:03] three stages of justification three
[50:04] stages of sanctification and three
[50:05] stages of the new birth all right
[50:07] Now by with me on that all right but
[50:10] what it's the progression of the same
[50:11] justification yes
[50:14] you know you did it
[50:17] and God forgave you of it
[50:19] put it in the sea of God forgetfulness
[50:21] never to be remembered again and we go
[50:23] fishing
[50:24] we go digging them back out
[50:27] leave him alone but there's going to be
[50:28] a time when them do they start to a
[50:30] perfect man to where brother Brown says
[50:33] the real you didn't do it
[50:36] that's powerful
[50:38] the real you in other words that new
[50:39] birth that you have that you have
[50:41] nurtured that you have added to that
[50:43] never did it to begin with if you're
[50:44] born again today inside of your soul is
[50:48] eternal life
[50:49] something that never ever lied cheated
[50:54] come on people that's what you got
[50:56] inside you got the new birth you've got
[50:58] Perfection inside of you you're just
[51:01] gonna have to what let it out
[51:03] and you got to know how to let it out so
[51:06] let brother around me explain this thing
[51:08] got eat by four bucks right we just read
[51:10] them now and if four messages of death
[51:13] killed the tree this is restoration of
[51:14] the broad tree if you need to know four
[51:16] messages of Life restore the tree
[51:22] justification sanitation baptism the
[51:24] Holy Ghost the word justification
[51:26] sanctification baptism logos the word
[51:28] more of
[51:30] more of
[51:32] more of adding what does that do
[51:37] gives you a bigger number
[51:39] add so we're adding something to our
[51:41] faith adding something to our new birth
[51:45] says do you get it amen for God said I
[51:47] will restore because see a lot of people
[51:50] you know brother Brown talks about three
[51:52] being Perfection and four is not a good
[51:54] number if you use it wrong
[51:55] but four is an Earthly number of man you
[51:58] can use it right because there are four
[51:59] death Messengers eat it down there had
[52:01] to be four life Messengers bring it back
[52:04] all right so by four death Messengers he
[52:07] killed it then for Life Messengers will
[52:10] restore it what was the first Martin
[52:12] Luther justification what was the second
[52:15] John Wesley sanctification
[52:18] what was the third Pentecost with the
[52:20] restoration of gifts the Holy Ghost stop
[52:22] right there
[52:24] no
[52:25] add
[52:28] what was the fourth the word
[52:31] and the Word was made flesh in me and
[52:33] you
[52:34] the word what the word there were four
[52:37] great prophets one of them Martin Luther
[52:39] he began to shine a light there was a
[52:41] little light just a very small strength
[52:42] of justification Along Came Wesley
[52:45] stronger sanctification after Wesley
[52:47] comes to stronger than him Pentecostal
[52:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in another
[52:52] great prophet we know it was the Holy
[52:54] Ghost right
[52:56] but in the last day look Malachi 4.
[52:59] Elijah's to come with the very word
[53:03] the word of the Lord come to the
[53:05] prophets in the evening light it is to
[53:07] come forth to restore and bring back
[53:09] what turn the hearts of the children
[53:11] back to the faith of God what was the
[53:13] faith of God those virtues
[53:16] the faith that was once delivered to the
[53:18] Saints here is now there is now here
[53:21] all right four Killers took it four
[53:24] Messengers destroyed it four messages of
[53:26] death took it away in Dogma four
[53:29] messengers of righteousness restore her
[53:31] back again prophesy son of man can these
[53:34] bones live remember the bone thing when
[53:36] you start talking about the bones the
[53:38] bones are fine putting the senior back
[53:39] on putting this up but without the
[53:41] Breath of Life breathe whole Breath of
[53:44] God now breathe whole Breath of God why
[53:48] that's the fourth stage that's bringing
[53:49] the life back right here wish we had
[53:51] time I got to write it down but I have
[53:53] to miss it prophesy can these bones live
[53:56] what's the four stages of that coming
[53:58] forth of that church what's the four
[54:00] stages of Ezekiel Dry Bones coming forth
[54:02] but the life only comes not when the sin
[54:05] your skin was on them but when the wind
[54:07] blowed upon them
[54:09] that's when come back that fourth
[54:11] message of life I will restore saith the
[54:14] Lord hallelujah Glory praise be to God
[54:16] the fourth light is to come that will
[54:18] bring forth the same signs watch
[54:19] justification brought back to Paul
[54:21] sanctification brought back the bar
[54:23] doctrine of Holiness while brought back
[54:25] the leaves Pentecostal leaves amen
[54:28] waving of hands Hallelujah fellowship
[54:31] and that's where the leaves are they're
[54:32] like this right here the leaves in a
[54:35] tree but you know what it takes wind to
[54:38] blow those leaves
[54:39] it takes the Holy Ghost
[54:41] to do that
[54:43] what brought back the leaves Pentecost
[54:45] what is it Pentecostal leaves clap their
[54:47] hands Joy rejoicing Pentecostal what the
[54:51] fourth was the word
[54:52] itself the word made flesh fruits of the
[54:55] proof of the Resurrection sign that
[54:57] Christ has finally after justification
[54:59] been planted sanctification been planted
[55:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations
[55:04] died out and Christ has again centered
[55:07] himself like that cap of the pyramid you
[55:10] look behind my head first line
[55:12] justification sanctification baptism the
[55:14] Holy Ghost then the coming of the cap
[55:15] what is it the Holy Ghost Bunch being
[55:18] honed out that's us
[55:20] hi there I contend it's us
[55:24] the Holy Ghost Bunch being what hold
[55:26] that why do we need to be honed out if
[55:27] we had Holy Ghost
[55:30] add
[55:34] so that what so that it can fit with the
[55:37] same kind of ministry he had now that's
[55:40] the issue we got
[55:42] down through the church ages it was in
[55:44] the first three Church ages
[55:46] but after that one happened
[55:48] dogmas and Creeds father son Holy Ghost
[55:52] denominations up until this time they
[55:54] have eaten that tree down to nothing
[55:57] but they can't kill it
[56:00] he has to restore according to the Book
[56:02] of Joel
[56:03] it will catch the whole thing when he
[56:05] comes back it'll catch the whole thing
[56:07] in the Rapture whether Justified
[56:08] Sanctified the baptism in the Lord goes
[56:10] that pyramid will stand again the house
[56:13] of God will live again the tree of life
[56:16] is growing
[56:18] again
[56:19] that's us
[56:21] no no Jesus is a tree of life we are a
[56:24] tree of life we're part of that tree Now
[56:28] read you in just a few minutes I I made
[56:30] a quote the other day about the The
[56:31] Vines being intertwined I'll read you a
[56:34] quote where brother Adam says that
[56:35] but we're talking about adoption we're
[56:37] talking about coming to a stage to add
[56:39] where you're not just a Christian that
[56:40] just gets beat all the pieces and Satan
[56:43] just absolutely just Rings your neck
[56:44] every service and every day of the week
[56:47] now there's got to come a place that you
[56:48] have Victory and it's not victory in the
[56:51] world or victory in Satan it's victory
[56:53] in Jesus all right I heard an old old
[56:56] story that's not old anymore it's brand
[56:58] new
[56:59] shall we come to adoption where God can
[57:02] use us
[57:03] where he can place us and use us for
[57:05] what he wants what he wants not what you
[57:08] want
[57:10] I was going to um
[57:12] insert here because it talks about
[57:14] adoption so Brother Richard had a
[57:15] question last night that we didn't get
[57:17] to Brother Richard Negron from Ohio so
[57:19] let's let's read the quote and the
[57:22] adoption series says tell me my brother
[57:23] tell me my sister when was the time that
[57:26] the sons of God was ever to be
[57:27] manifested outside look outside of this
[57:30] time right now
[57:32] right now this time
[57:35] when there was ever a time in history
[57:37] that manifested the time of deliver all
[57:40] nature nature the nature itself is
[57:43] groaning waiting for the time of
[57:45] manifestation of what trees rocks
[57:48] churches
[57:50] pews some books
[57:52] tapes oh excuse me
[57:55] people yes
[57:58] the word made flesh
[58:01] in you
[58:03] groaning waiting for the time of
[58:05] manifestation why before the atonement
[58:08] was made before the Holy Ghost was ever
[58:09] poured out all the Old Testament on down
[58:12] there couldn't have been manifestation
[58:13] it had to wait till this time now all
[58:17] things has been brought coming shaping
[58:19] up to a headstone to the manifestation
[58:21] of sons of God coming back now watch and
[58:24] the spirit of God coming into these men
[58:26] that was his question these men I'm
[58:28] talking about Bob black
[58:30] I'm done by Samuel Dale I'm talking
[58:32] about the Luis Durango talking about
[58:34] Aaron Roberts
[58:36] yes come on fill in the blank put your
[58:39] favorite preacher in there
[58:42] if he's a real true preacher
[58:44] so the spirit coming into these men
[58:45] because there's only going to be a
[58:47] certain group
[58:49] and I listen
[58:50] for our visitors and anybody else
[58:55] we're not exclusive
[58:58] God makes us that way though if we if
[59:00] you'll put yourself because remember
[59:01] what happened to the disciples they were
[59:04] so different
[59:07] remember they were called Christians
[59:09] because they acted like Christ in other
[59:11] words they were so different they
[59:13] noticed it now what happened though
[59:14] that's what killed a lot of them
[59:18] that's what killed Jesus because he was
[59:20] different
[59:21] and listen they may not kill you
[59:23] naturally but they'll kill you
[59:25] spiritually
[59:27] so the spirit's going to come back in a
[59:28] group of men I believe I believe that
[59:32] so perfectly until their Ministry
[59:37] their ministry will be so close like
[59:40] Christ till it'll join him and his
[59:43] church together
[59:44] there's been a great division that's
[59:46] been over the word of God why do we do
[59:48] this why don't we do that why you do
[59:49] this why do that why do this why is that
[59:52] what's my old saying lead follow or get
[59:56] out of the way
[59:58] that's what my old football coach said
[59:59] and it stuck with me forever listen lead
[1:00:01] follow get out of the way find out your
[1:00:03] position if you're a follower that's
[1:00:05] fine but the follower has to have a
[1:00:07] leader
[1:00:08] and I don't ever want to be in the way
[1:00:10] and neither do you want to be in the way
[1:00:11] of somebody to get their new birth to
[1:00:13] get their attitude
[1:00:15] we want you to be able to add to in this
[1:00:18] church we want you to be able to not say
[1:00:20] I go to Lulu and I've got a college
[1:00:22] degree in the message of the hour
[1:00:26] let God do that
[1:00:28] let the Headmaster do that let the
[1:00:30] Headmaster
[1:00:33] give you that degree
[1:00:36] if the Headmaster gives you that degree
[1:00:37] then you know who you are
[1:00:39] you know who you are you know where you
[1:00:41] came from not just here geographically
[1:00:43] you know you came from God and you're
[1:00:45] going back to God
[1:00:49] I'd rather
[1:00:50] um want brother Wayne I think was
[1:00:52] preaching under the grave clothes we get
[1:00:54] we got a resurrection folks
[1:00:56] when you got born again it was a
[1:00:58] resurrection
[1:00:59] now we got to get a resurrection Brother
[1:01:01] Robinson out of dead denominationalism
[1:01:03] all that dead stuff we had inside of us
[1:01:05] has got to go
[1:01:07] it's stinking
[1:01:10] they know what they said about Lazarus
[1:01:12] but Lord he's thinking that didn't
[1:01:15] bother Jesus not one bit he didn't have
[1:01:17] that little cortisol we were talking
[1:01:18] about he didn't have a release of of
[1:01:21] fear that didn't bother him he said I am
[1:01:24] the resurrection and the life and it's
[1:01:25] where we're going to come to ourselves
[1:01:27] my friends
[1:01:28] we've got to come to the knowledge that
[1:01:31] knowledge not the knowledge you got born
[1:01:32] again you need to have that knowledge at
[1:01:34] the bottom
[1:01:35] all right you need to have that
[1:01:36] knowledge that you're born again that
[1:01:38] you're a child of God then you need Holy
[1:01:40] Ghost knowledge to add to yes your new
[1:01:44] birth
[1:01:45] that's what we've been talking about
[1:01:47] besides this giving all Dylan just add
[1:01:49] to your faith version to Virtual
[1:01:51] knowledge that word knowledge means no
[1:01:53] sense now watch in the Greek Lexicon
[1:01:55] look knowledge signifies in general
[1:01:58] intelligence understanding the general
[1:02:00] knowledge of Christian religion the
[1:02:01] deeper more perfect and in large
[1:02:03] knowledge of this religion such as
[1:02:05] belongs to the more advanced so what is
[1:02:08] knowledge it's knowing more about
[1:02:09] whatever you're studying
[1:02:11] man
[1:02:13] that's why Jesus said You shall know the
[1:02:15] truth not that it's just going to be
[1:02:17] dumped on you but you got to get what
[1:02:19] you got to get somebody to teach you
[1:02:22] such as belongs to the more advanced
[1:02:25] especially of things lawful and unlawful
[1:02:27] for Christians moral wisdom such as seen
[1:02:30] and right living in other words you're
[1:02:31] going to show you say no bro wait
[1:02:33] knowledge is to be able to do calculus
[1:02:34] and trigonometry and and you know Power
[1:02:37] Square and all this stuff not that kind
[1:02:39] of knowledge
[1:02:40] that's Holy Ghost knowledge
[1:02:44] foreign
[1:02:46] but there were two trees
[1:02:48] in the garden
[1:02:50] and out of the ground made the Lord God
[1:02:51] to grow every tree that's Pleasant to
[1:02:53] the site and good for food the tree of
[1:02:55] life also in the midst of the garden and
[1:02:58] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:02:59] so you've got two trees you've got two
[1:03:01] branches of knowledge
[1:03:04] because Jesus said I am the way the
[1:03:06] truth and the life so there's true the
[1:03:08] true over here then you've got the
[1:03:10] knowledge of Good and Evil the false
[1:03:11] over here on this side all right and the
[1:03:13] Lord God commanded man saying all right
[1:03:16] you eat all the trees you can eat over
[1:03:18] here under this tree of life
[1:03:22] but if you go over here and eat over
[1:03:24] this one you're gonna die
[1:03:26] for in the day that you eat that day you
[1:03:29] shall die now here we go this is the
[1:03:32] quote I was looking for the other day
[1:03:34] in Ephesian Church age brother Adam said
[1:03:36] now to get the real meaning of what
[1:03:37] we're about to go into I must caution
[1:03:39] you to ever keep in mind that religion
[1:03:43] listen folks religion will kill you
[1:03:46] I'm religious so is the Devil he's
[1:03:49] actually more religious than you are
[1:03:51] he comes to church more than most of
[1:03:53] y'all
[1:03:55] spiritual matters if you like is
[1:03:57] composed of two parts that what
[1:03:59] intertwine now what is intertwined
[1:04:03] you think no this tree over here it's
[1:04:05] all niled up in this ugly tree of life I
[1:04:08] mean tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:04:09] it's just all nasty and look so bad and
[1:04:12] uh do you think the devil
[1:04:15] looks like the people portray him he's
[1:04:17] not some guy with a red suit on with a
[1:04:19] long tail Fork your tongue and all that
[1:04:21] stuff no he's a brother Brown called him
[1:04:23] a Slicker he was actually the most
[1:04:26] beautiful angel in heaven
[1:04:28] so don't think he's changed he has not
[1:04:30] changed his tactics one bit right so
[1:04:33] that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:04:34] look if Eve was standing here
[1:04:38] as an allegory if he was standing in the
[1:04:40] garden and she looks at the tree of life
[1:04:42] and then she looked over at the tree of
[1:04:44] knowledge and good and evil which one
[1:04:46] did she pick
[1:04:50] Ed she picked that one because it was
[1:04:52] beautiful I read it last Sunday
[1:04:54] beautiful to the eye and a tree to be
[1:04:56] desired to make one wife desire to make
[1:04:59] one why so she goes over here and takes
[1:05:00] this beautiful tree
[1:05:03] this tree of life over here you know is
[1:05:05] probably all bloody
[1:05:07] come on somebody
[1:05:08] probably got Stripes all over it
[1:05:10] probably got a few you know looks like
[1:05:12] this or looks like this
[1:05:15] so she chose that one because of beauty
[1:05:18] and what does she choose death
[1:05:21] now we've got to be able to turn the
[1:05:23] table and choose life and be the tree of
[1:05:26] life not just eat off of it but be it
[1:05:28] now watch this right here
[1:05:30] the two parts that intertwine border are
[1:05:33] as opposite as black and white
[1:05:36] religion and the spiritual world are
[1:05:39] made of these two trees which had their
[1:05:41] roots in Eden
[1:05:43] in other words they had their Roots they
[1:05:45] started in Eden
[1:05:46] both the tree of life and the tree of
[1:05:48] knowledge of Good and Evil stood in the
[1:05:50] midst of the garden and no doubt their
[1:05:53] very branches intertwined each other
[1:05:56] have you ever tried everybody we're from
[1:05:58] the south we know what Kudzu is our
[1:06:00] sisters from the Philippines may not
[1:06:02] know but in Oklahoma I think the guy in
[1:06:04] Oklahoma too but they brought this weed
[1:06:06] this weed that's supposed to take care
[1:06:08] of erosion they brought it into Georgia
[1:06:10] and South Carolina different places from
[1:06:12] China
[1:06:13] China it was made in China
[1:06:20] control erosion after The Boll Weevil
[1:06:23] came through and people quit putting
[1:06:24] cotton out and and the brains would come
[1:06:27] and it'd be ditches will they give us
[1:06:28] Kudzu
[1:06:30] have you ever there there is somewhere
[1:06:32] in that Kudzu pile that you look out on
[1:06:34] the side of the road and there's like
[1:06:35] Acres of it there's somewhere there it
[1:06:36] came from one route
[1:06:39] one route but it so intertwines you
[1:06:42] can't find it
[1:06:43] unless God tells you where it's at same
[1:06:46] way in your life you're hey your life is
[1:06:49] all tangled up
[1:06:51] but some were in there if you're a child
[1:06:53] of God
[1:06:55] something is growing as we were talking
[1:06:57] about last night it's not a seed it's
[1:06:59] the word of God that you're listening to
[1:07:01] and you're eating it and you're becoming
[1:07:03] it
[1:07:05] and then you know where to cut it down
[1:07:06] you know where that very root of evil is
[1:07:08] because that root of evil was inside of
[1:07:10] you to begin with so you know where it
[1:07:12] originated from
[1:07:14] so now that's what that's what just tear
[1:07:16] that thing apart
[1:07:17] now listen
[1:07:18] that's the Ephesians church is that same
[1:07:20] Paradox the church is made up of good
[1:07:22] and bad now the Ephesians Church age was
[1:07:25] the what First Church age the alpha
[1:07:26] Church age remember Alpha now Omega has
[1:07:29] got to be a shadow of that church age or
[1:07:32] a duplication of that church age Alpha
[1:07:34] and Omega Church all right so that's
[1:07:36] just if it's talking about them it's
[1:07:38] talking about us because we left our
[1:07:39] first love
[1:07:41] right not we maybe but we the world the
[1:07:43] religious World Indian time has lost
[1:07:45] their first love
[1:07:47] they are like the wheat a look two Vines
[1:07:49] make the church
[1:07:53] two Vines no brother brown two my two
[1:07:55] Vines makes the world
[1:08:00] we're gonna read Matthew 24 24 there
[1:08:02] share arrives false Christ false
[1:08:03] prophets false anointed people
[1:08:06] they're like the wheat and tears growing
[1:08:08] up side by side
[1:08:10] but true the
[1:08:16] and he will talk about each one
[1:08:19] he will call them the church
[1:08:23] and only the elect
[1:08:28] the new birth will change your thought
[1:08:31] it will tell you where the root is
[1:08:35] right he will call them the church
[1:08:36] that's why brother Brown said church
[1:08:38] church Pride churches he said but
[1:08:39] there's going to come one he stood up
[1:08:41] one day and he said I don't call you
[1:08:42] church anymore I call you bride because
[1:08:44] there's scripture is talking about the
[1:08:45] bride this scriptures talking about the
[1:08:47] church he pulled out what he pulled that
[1:08:50] thing apart by The Roots
[1:08:53] now what are we doing with it are we
[1:08:55] trying to put it all back together again
[1:08:58] no we're supposed to what shun the very
[1:09:00] he told us what evil was get away from
[1:09:03] it
[1:09:05] he will call them the church and only
[1:09:07] the elect will really know which is the
[1:09:09] true Spirit only the elect will not be
[1:09:12] deceived Matthew 24 24 for that shall
[1:09:14] rise false Christ and false prophets and
[1:09:17] shall show great signs and wonders and
[1:09:18] so much that if it was possible they
[1:09:20] shall deceive the very light so way back
[1:09:23] there in the early church a very short
[1:09:25] period after Pentecost he's talking
[1:09:27] about 80 30.
[1:09:28] the false Vine got so intertwined itself
[1:09:31] around the True Vine and we find these
[1:09:33] D's in the Nicolaitans and that spirit
[1:09:35] is going to be found fighting the True
[1:09:37] Vine what until God destroys it
[1:09:41] how's it going to destroy it by you and
[1:09:43] me
[1:09:45] knowing which one is the true and which
[1:09:48] one is the false and like brother Brown
[1:09:50] said no where the two Spirits are are
[1:09:52] the two
[1:09:53] Spirits working in the framework of this
[1:09:55] church
[1:09:57] and be able to discern
[1:10:00] which one's which and be able to what be
[1:10:03] able to withstand the devil in his
[1:10:06] actions
[1:10:07] by what by having Holy Ghost knowledge
[1:10:09] more than just knowledge of Acts 2 38.
[1:10:14] knowing you got to be adopted knowing
[1:10:18] you've got to be part of the seals they
[1:10:20] were saying your name's in the book
[1:10:24] it's part of us man I'm telling you if
[1:10:27] you realize your names in that book
[1:10:30] Hallelujah
[1:10:32] Satan can't stop it
[1:10:34] false Christ can't stop it
[1:10:37] false teachers can't stop it the Devil
[1:10:40] Himself could walk right in here and he
[1:10:42] cannot do anything to your soul if
[1:10:44] you're a Christian today
[1:10:45] that thing is like a 10 billion vote if
[1:10:48] he tries to touch it he is going to get
[1:10:51] burnt
[1:10:52] because you know what that's God's going
[1:10:54] to put him in the Lake of Fire the Lake
[1:10:55] of Fire is the Holy Ghost Fire right
[1:10:57] it's not fire that it's not fire that
[1:10:59] burns
[1:11:03] Holy Ghost knowledge the factor
[1:11:05] condition of knowing something with what
[1:11:07] familiarity
[1:11:09] you're familiar with it
[1:11:11] it's not strange to hear what we teach
[1:11:14] here
[1:11:15] it may be to some that just started but
[1:11:17] it's not strange for all of us that we
[1:11:19] talked about last night
[1:11:20] as brother Wayne Lawson different ones
[1:11:22] that tell you and and you know to give
[1:11:24] to give a rose I'm going to give it now
[1:11:28] the preachers that come to preach in
[1:11:29] this church
[1:11:31] tell me
[1:11:34] that this is the one of the freest
[1:11:36] churches that they can preach in brother
[1:11:39] Wayne said hey I didn't have to explain
[1:11:40] a bunch of stuff he said your people
[1:11:41] already knew it
[1:11:44] but there's a lot of people scared of it
[1:11:48] there's a lot of people scared of it I
[1:11:49] heard one preacher who's not in the
[1:11:50] message anymore he said I don't like to
[1:11:52] preach in Louisville Georgia they know
[1:11:54] too much
[1:11:55] praise God
[1:11:59] if I got later sorry brother Dale's got
[1:12:02] laity that can now preach the preachers
[1:12:04] praise God
[1:12:09] my brother Tim cross he don't mind me
[1:12:12] saying it he's coming to preach for us
[1:12:13] the end of this month because I got to
[1:12:15] do a wedding in Ohio so he's going to be
[1:12:17] here the weekend I said he said well he
[1:12:19] he was we were kind of just discussing
[1:12:21] that and giggling a little bit but he
[1:12:23] said well he said I'll try my best to
[1:12:25] stay you know on the line I said well
[1:12:27] don't worry I said if you don't a couple
[1:12:29] of my sisters will meet you in the back
[1:12:30] door before you get up
[1:12:33] I ain't worried about nobody else saying
[1:12:35] about it anything about it so
[1:12:37] I'll promise you
[1:12:40] I'll see Trudy McMillan on them
[1:12:44] what do you mean by
[1:12:47] and we and we laugh but you know what I
[1:12:49] don't mind that doesn't make me
[1:12:50] uncomfortable
[1:12:51] does that make you uncomfortable doesn't
[1:12:52] make me uncomfortable
[1:12:55] it's a shame that if our sisters in this
[1:12:57] church cannot preach the preachers the
[1:12:59] message
[1:13:00] but why because we've been taught
[1:13:02] we've stayed here we've listened we've
[1:13:04] learned
[1:13:06] we know what the message of the hour the
[1:13:08] essence of the message we can't quote
[1:13:10] every quote but we know the answers why
[1:13:12] did we need the right interpretation of
[1:13:15] of the statute perfect man brother they
[1:13:17] was talking about last night there's
[1:13:18] nobody sits here and preaches
[1:13:19] 80-something sermons and he preaches
[1:13:21] like 40 several years ago on one subject
[1:13:25] the statue perfect man oh yeah they may
[1:13:28] hit it here back and forth and that's
[1:13:30] fine we all got our different calling
[1:13:32] but listen there's going to be one group
[1:13:34] of people that's going to take a body
[1:13:36] change
[1:13:39] and it's because they know who they are
[1:13:45] they're not going to be foolish versions
[1:13:50] then Jesus said if you continue my word
[1:13:52] then you are my disciples indeed and you
[1:13:54] shall know the truth that word no means
[1:13:57] what perceive or understand get a
[1:13:58] knowledge of
[1:14:00] perceive and then we talked about it a
[1:14:02] little bit last Wednesday it's a Jewish
[1:14:04] idiom for sexual intercourse between a
[1:14:05] man and a woman Adam knew his wife
[1:14:09] hey God knew I
[1:14:13] he said well that sounds bad no read the
[1:14:15] Bible the Bible says I I've cast out
[1:14:18] Devils Lord
[1:14:19] I've done Mighty well he was in Your
[1:14:21] Name Lord he said depart from me I I
[1:14:24] never knew you
[1:14:26] and if you look that word knew up it
[1:14:28] says the same thing you've never had an
[1:14:30] intimate relationship with me so I don't
[1:14:32] know you
[1:14:36] thank God for an intimate relationship
[1:14:38] that we know who our husband is and we
[1:14:40] know what he expects because it's the
[1:14:42] same character
[1:14:45] he was literally pulled out of Adam
[1:14:49] they were one so Adam could understand
[1:14:51] Eve
[1:14:55] that might help in our relationship if
[1:14:57] we were kind of like that wouldn't it
[1:14:59] X and Y Mars and Venus you know
[1:15:03] and the sister said
[1:15:05] amen
[1:15:07] and the Lord God called unto Adam where
[1:15:10] are you he said I was afraid now Adam
[1:15:12] never said that before you and I got to
[1:15:14] get out of that fear
[1:15:16] and what'll take you out of that fear
[1:15:18] good teaching
[1:15:20] not listen shout speaking that's
[1:15:22] fine paralyzed there's a time for all
[1:15:25] that
[1:15:26] like brother Donnie said he said look
[1:15:28] there's a time for special meetings he
[1:15:30] said but where the rubber meets the road
[1:15:32] is every Sunday and every Wednesday and
[1:15:34] every Sunday and every Wednesday you go
[1:15:36] to church you listen to your pastor you
[1:15:38] listen to your preachers it's not all
[1:15:40] bubble dancing all the time you have to
[1:15:43] listen and learn
[1:15:44] and every once in a while somebody might
[1:15:47] say Amen
[1:15:51] be afraid little bride somebody's gonna
[1:15:54] make it
[1:15:55] I'm just dumb enough to what believe
[1:15:57] it's me and you
[1:16:01] Proverbs 3 verse 13 says happy as a man
[1:16:03] that findeth wisdom and the man that
[1:16:05] gives us understanding so wisdom and
[1:16:07] understanding all comes down to
[1:16:08] knowledge for the merchandise is better
[1:16:11] than the merchandise of silver and the
[1:16:13] gain therefore than gold now watch it
[1:16:15] has transformed now into a she
[1:16:18] she is him it's us the bride she is more
[1:16:21] precious than rubies she is what in this
[1:16:24] in this allegory she is wisdom
[1:16:27] but remember brother Ryan said she and
[1:16:29] the woman is in the Bible is what the
[1:16:31] Bride of the church
[1:16:33] and all things thou cast desire are not
[1:16:36] to be compared into her Length of days
[1:16:39] is her right inner right hand her left
[1:16:40] hand riches in honor her ways are ways
[1:16:43] of pleasantness and all her paths are
[1:16:44] peace she is a tree of life
[1:16:48] to them that lay hold upon her and happy
[1:16:52] as everyone that retaineth her
[1:16:55] Philippians 1 9 says in this prayer this
[1:16:58] I pray that your love may abound yet
[1:17:00] more and more in knowledge and in what
[1:17:03] all judgment as we were talking last
[1:17:04] night the Bible here tells us is do you
[1:17:07] know the Saints shall judge the world
[1:17:09] why take why take a brother to court
[1:17:12] settle it right here
[1:17:14] because you should have enough wisdom of
[1:17:16] the Holy Ghost to tell you what to do
[1:17:17] now somebody out there and that's
[1:17:19] different
[1:17:20] okay the people out there they're just
[1:17:22] they're they're heathens they don't
[1:17:24] accept the word of God so they can't use
[1:17:27] the word of God to uh as I was telling
[1:17:29] you before the little girl that's having
[1:17:30] some trouble in our in our post office
[1:17:32] uh she's having trouble but she's not
[1:17:34] she's never been in church in her life
[1:17:37] her husband's ever been churching a lot
[1:17:38] I can't counsel people like that
[1:17:40] give them some good suggestions
[1:17:42] but when you start talking about getting
[1:17:43] them together the first thing the only
[1:17:45] thing I told her even yesterday I said
[1:17:46] Kelly you've got to get in church
[1:17:49] just go somewhere sit down and listen
[1:17:53] take your husband and your two kids if
[1:17:55] not I there's nothing I can do for you
[1:17:59] because see I could tell her to pray
[1:18:01] more read the Bible come together
[1:18:02] counsel how can you counsel somebody
[1:18:04] that don't know a thing about about God
[1:18:07] no you're not that we shall judge Angels
[1:18:09] now that was a question last night about
[1:18:10] judging angels and here in in Jude one
[1:18:14] of the body
[1:18:15] Aaron Brother Aaron Minister put the
[1:18:18] peace together for us
[1:18:19] and the angel which kept not their first
[1:18:21] estate but left their own habitation he
[1:18:24] hath reserved an everlasting change
[1:18:25] under Darkness unto the judgment
[1:18:30] of the great day now who's going to
[1:18:31] stand and be the judge on a great day
[1:18:34] we are
[1:18:35] the Saints so judge the world also the
[1:18:39] Saints are going to judge all those
[1:18:40] angels that turn God down
[1:18:43] right this is it right here
[1:18:45] thank God we got a Bible answer
[1:18:48] now knowledge just for a second we'll
[1:18:50] close right here didn't even get into
[1:18:52] temperance
[1:18:53] y'all just gonna have to be hold your
[1:18:55] temper till next week
[1:18:58] two weeks
[1:19:01] for some of you you'll explode
[1:19:03] then thirdly you add knowledge I didn't
[1:19:06] brother what I did not look at you I did
[1:19:08] not I looked way over here
[1:19:10] back to Amy back that way
[1:19:15] knowledge now that don't mean worldly
[1:19:17] knowledge because that's foolishness to
[1:19:18] God but knowledge to what judge you're
[1:19:20] judging today whether what I'm telling
[1:19:22] you is right or wrong
[1:19:24] you say no I'm just saying you are
[1:19:25] you're not you're judging yes
[1:19:28] you laughing now
[1:19:31] yeah that was judgmental yes well
[1:19:33] judgment comes in the house from the
[1:19:34] house of God we won't keep quoting
[1:19:36] scripture back and forth
[1:19:38] you all know Amy's a sweetheart they'd
[1:19:40] have made a bad spot in her whole psyche
[1:19:43] she's a wonderful girl
[1:19:44] now Jeffrey and we'll talk about him a
[1:19:46] little bit
[1:19:47] because that's foolish where's he at he
[1:19:50] left he left
[1:19:52] he left oh no I'm just kidding he had to
[1:19:54] take care of one of the kids but
[1:19:56] but look knowledge the judge judge right
[1:19:58] from wrong how do you judge it if you've
[1:20:00] got Christian knowledge
[1:20:02] all right with your virtue and New Birth
[1:20:07] you judge whether the word is right or
[1:20:09] wrong but when you can see that the
[1:20:11] scripture is not contradictory when you
[1:20:13] see all these what look you can see by
[1:20:15] Revelation the whole word is wrote In
[1:20:17] what Mysteries
[1:20:19] and only the knowledge of God can reveal
[1:20:22] it
[1:20:24] then when you get and say punctuate
[1:20:26] every word of God with an amen then add
[1:20:28] that
[1:20:29] to your faith 70 weeks to Daniel brother
[1:20:32] around to the spirit of wisdom and I
[1:20:33] believe now that Spirit of wisdom is
[1:20:34] come back into the church
[1:20:37] to make known to the church by the
[1:20:38] revelation of the Holy Ghost bring the
[1:20:40] church in or revealing what day you're
[1:20:42] living in it's all we're living in the
[1:20:43] end time but what day are you really
[1:20:45] living in
[1:20:46] we know they've said end time for years
[1:20:49] you got to know what day and hour you're
[1:20:51] living in you're in the bright age
[1:20:52] you're looking for a resurrection you're
[1:20:54] looking for a body change and then
[1:20:56] you're looking for a rapture
[1:20:58] all right
[1:21:01] same as Gabriel came to Daniel the Holy
[1:21:03] Spirit comes to the church in the last
[1:21:04] day to reveal these great deep secret
[1:21:07] things do you understand now
[1:21:10] Ephesians 1 says give you the spirit of
[1:21:12] wisdom and Revelation and knowledge of
[1:21:14] him
[1:21:15] the Bible says and that you may know
[1:21:18] keep going I need to get to a spot and
[1:21:20] we'll finish
[1:21:22] this is one right this is one we're
[1:21:23] talking about the other day there's
[1:21:25] Jeffrey there's nothing of such
[1:21:27] prevailing power as a revelation of the
[1:21:30] word prevailing power in other words
[1:21:31] overcoming power power that you can take
[1:21:33] and say hey devil I know what God's
[1:21:35] talking about
[1:21:36] I don't know what you're talking about
[1:21:38] but I know what God's talking about
[1:21:42] then we keep going on towards his but
[1:21:44] the prevailing overcoming church is
[1:21:46] built on Revelation so we can expect God
[1:21:49] to reveal his truth to us listen I was
[1:21:52] reading last night brother Ralph said as
[1:21:54] we get closer to the headstone it
[1:21:55] becomes more narrow why it's honing off
[1:21:59] sadly some people are going to be left
[1:22:01] right here because there's a big wide
[1:22:02] bottom to it
[1:22:04] some people are going to go to Virtue
[1:22:05] some knowledge temperate patience
[1:22:07] godliness but it's going to get less and
[1:22:08] less
[1:22:10] as you come to the headstone
[1:22:13] see because look right here brother I'm
[1:22:15] saying however you actually don't need a
[1:22:17] revelation on water baptism it's staring
[1:22:18] you right in the face so you don't need
[1:22:20] that kind of knowledge for water baptism
[1:22:22] you need it down here
[1:22:25] we need to call on God for Revelation
[1:22:27] more than anything else in the world we
[1:22:29] have accepted the Bible I'll finish
[1:22:31] right here come on musician come on now
[1:22:34] we have accepted the Bible amen we have
[1:22:38] accepted the great truths of it but it
[1:22:40] still is not real to most people
[1:22:43] wow
[1:22:45] because the Revelation by the spirit is
[1:22:48] not there
[1:22:49] the word has not been quickened
[1:22:51] the Bible says in second Corinthians 5
[1:22:54] 21 that we have become the righteousness
[1:22:56] of God by what by knowing
[1:23:01] what is a union Adam knew his wife
[1:23:05] Christ's knew his bride knows his bride
[1:23:08] by our Union with Jesus Christ did you
[1:23:10] get it it says that we are the very
[1:23:12] righteousness of God himself by being in
[1:23:15] Christ it says that he Jesus became sin
[1:23:17] for us it does not say he became sinful
[1:23:20] but became sin for us that we by our
[1:23:22] Union with him we might become what the
[1:23:24] righteousness of God the word made flesh
[1:23:28] if we accept the fact and we must
[1:23:31] we must have knowledge on this fact
[1:23:35] that he literally became sin for us by
[1:23:38] his substitution for us then we must
[1:23:40] also accept the fact that we are by
[1:23:42] Union with him have become the very
[1:23:45] righteousness of God Amen
[1:23:48] to reject one
[1:23:49] is to reject the other
[1:23:52] to accept one
[1:23:53] is to accept the other now we know the
[1:23:56] Bible says that it can't be denied but
[1:23:59] the revelation of it is missing my
[1:24:02] brother William said pray for Revelation
[1:24:03] more than anything pray for revelation
[1:24:07] it can't be denied but the revelation of
[1:24:10] it is missing it is not real to the
[1:24:12] majority now look it's not real to the
[1:24:14] majority of Satan's kids
[1:24:16] that's not what that said
[1:24:18] it said it is not real to the majority
[1:24:20] of God's children
[1:24:22] wow it is just a good verse in the Bible
[1:24:25] but we need to have it made alive
[1:24:29] to us that will take
[1:24:32] Revelation let's stand to our feet
[1:24:34] that will take
[1:24:36] revelation
[1:24:40] and talks about being our senses being
[1:24:42] exercised to discern both Good and Evil
[1:24:46] the word discern is to separate make a
[1:24:48] distinction discriminator to prefer if
[1:24:50] you have inside you the Holy Ghost today
[1:24:52] it will discern whether what I told you
[1:24:54] is right or not
[1:24:56] whether whether your body
[1:25:00] and and part you know the spirit part of
[1:25:02] you denies it
[1:25:04] inside your soul you gotta punctuate it
[1:25:06] with an amen if you're born again
[1:25:09] and you can say I don't understand that
[1:25:11] listen because everything's not going to
[1:25:12] be just dropped into your lap
[1:25:14] you got to listen you got to study
[1:25:16] kindergarten versus 12th grade you got
[1:25:19] to start kindergarten to get to 12th
[1:25:21] grade all right
[1:25:23] that's the same way in God that's the
[1:25:25] way I can understand God
[1:25:27] it's just by the natural life that we
[1:25:29] live and that's what the Bible tells us
[1:25:31] so let's sing a song God bless you
