again to do something to win amen and we're more than conquerors if we just continue to hold on to that unchanging hand by the grace of Lord and to pray for one another lifting one another up I believe we live in such a time of this independent spirit that you just are we hardly pray from one another the way we should and that's so important I was reading a story not too long ago about this this man he went to a brother's house and his teenager son picked up the phone and was very rude he was on one line and that was when the phones were attached to the walls and his father's friend picked up the phone and the young man was on the phone he was like who was on the phone get off the phone I'm on the phone was just very rude and that man left and he'd called the dad later on he said oh my heart was broken when I heard your son acting like that and I've been up in the mountains praying and fasting and God gave me the victory and that man was changed that young man was changed and he was sharing his testimony back then and that's how I was so important to pray for one another certainly the young people they certainly need our prayers during this time I mean it's a very dangerous dangerous dangerous time in the enemy he's at war and it almost feels like nothing's wrong which is wrong it feels like nothing's or they're fine they're gonna be okay no we have to pray for one another the Satan is doing everything he can amen and not just for the young ones but for all of us it's no doubt it's a battle amen well let's get ready for the word let's stand you excited amen well let's sing with all of our heart our brother get ready open the eyes of my heart hope in the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart I want to see I want to see open the eyes of my [Music] open the eyes my heart I want to see I want to see to see you high and lifted [Music] shining in the [Applause] [Music] holy hi shining in the light under Maury pour out your power and as we say [Music] only warning [Music] holy holy holy Lord they've lent you want to see him you've you've heard the song song now just turn around and say god bless you to somebody and you'll find him right there good to be in the house of the Lord couldn't have all of you here got a good crowd even when half the crowds gone so remember to pray for brother Dale and Anna they're on their way up too and they're actually going to Vanderbilt University there where brother Dale is and and that's where brother Dale our brother Dale should be up there where he can pray for him and and give him give the family some comfort we're still human beings we still got things that we go through that we we need help with so we pray the Lord will bless them tomorrow whatever they have to go through if there's any left Thomas just give them back the tea and let him I got I ran those off so we don't have to do the chart and you can write your own notes or whatever on it and and keep them with you because we're going to be studying now on the six fold purpose I doubt we're going to get two but maybe one of them today so just give everybody one that should be about 50 of them so I mean little kids probably doesn't need one but unless they want to color on it or draw on it Michael Wow they grow up don't they man they grow up but good to be here like said remember the brothers coming back from North Carolina they had a real good time talk to them yesterday they're having some really good fellowship brother Bob and brother Lewis and brother Zack and brother Joe and brother Anderson and their family or are coming back from North Carolina I think as we speak so just keep them many prayers I also put on your calendar October 26 that will be our church fall annual Fall Festival down it guilty park we got to get all the arrangements done for that but it'll be we'll have hot dogs and all that stuff and little things to do for the kids so that will be October 26th coming up man it's almost an October grief he said he'd make a short work of it which I'm glad he is I don't want this thing to drag out no longer Linda then then then it really is so I wanted to get out of here so um and that's what we're gonna try to do so today if you mind turn your Bibles or I gave you all the copy I didn't know but the brothers in the back I told them a streak young men sitting back then if you add all three of their ages up they probably not even gotten to my age yet so but they've got huge amounts of experience and they're gonna try to put the stuff on the board but if they don't get it all up there then you've got it you should have most of it all therefore you can read it so we're going to go into the six fold purpose this brother Dale was saying this morning we we need to understand dang of seventy weeks maybe there's still people that have different ideas but like I told you before we got to go by what the Bible says because brother Branham did not change the Bible he cannot change the Bible faced final resting place we'll read it in a few minutes if some of y'all ready to read through the quotes I found two of them where brother Branham said face final resting place is in the Word of God so whatever the prophet of God said and whatever any preacher says has to connect back to the Bible can't be contrary or change it because the Bible is unchanging at least we can put our faith in that that the Bible is unchanging amen and then you know the prophet of God told us he told us to look into the Bible and see ourself so as we look at this today we're going to look part of the six fold purpose but we must see our Redemption first so look at this is the plan of redemption for the children of Israel but it's also an allegory are a has an underlying meaning for the Gentile church because the six seals finishes Redemption there's no Redemption in the Seventh Seal that's Christ there six sales finishes Redemption and then the Seventh Seal is Christ himself which we've been talking brother Dale has been talking about which would be the headstone but not Christ coming back here in a corporal body he does not come here in a corporal body until if you look on your chart where it says thousand year millennial reign Christ is not coming back until then it's in a body form so what body does you have you and I where his body where his movement where his actions that's why that's faith virtue knowledge temperance place in college brotherly kindness that's the action of the body of Christ here on earth alright and Israel has fell from that we've been discussing that Israel fell from being bride but they didn't fall so far that God is not gonna redeem them back and bring them in their service because he said he would never ever forget Israel so we can't forget Israel and then so if you turn to Daniel 9 verse 21 I know we all have needs if you lift your hand I know there there's a lot of things on our heart today of healings and salvation and I don't know I'm gonna I'm gonna give you a little a little hint if you write here under this pulpit about right here under down in my Sunday School class is a board full of names some of your names are on there your family's names are on there your husband's wife sisters brothers my all family got all on that that board right there I want to start taking those off I won't start taking those off because that's for that's for salvation that whole thing I want to take them off I want to see them here I don't want to see a picture in here I want to see them here in the building amen I want to see them here we all have them down there so it's all connected to every one of us so as we pray let's remember those that are right here we pray over them and we preach over them every Sunday and every Wednesday so let's just start claiming the ground is as the Israel has a land Israel has a land to claim and a city to claim so do we have a land to claim this land this land you claim your kids came from this land my kids can't my kids came out of this land and then so we're gonna pray that God will bring them in amen because we all have them down there so we're all connected to it so let's bow our heads you have any father thank you for this day that you give us we pray number one that you would be the active participant in the service Lord you'd be the one that does the speaking you'd be the one that does the revealing because without you here Lord it truly is just a meeting of minds father we pray Lord that you'll beaver brothers a land animal as they travel on highways that you'll clear all the traffic back let them give them a good safe trip and when they get up there to to be with the family they're the Robert's family Lord that all would be well that you'll grant them Lord the petition that we all pray that brother Roberts will come out of that thing and be made whole because you're you're the God that can do that we call them the Great Physician not one that's up there we have good doctors on the earth but there's a great physician and that's you Lord I prayed that you'd come on the scene and be there with them and let us have a good report father each one Lord brother Sterling's sitting back there in the in the foyer back there with with a headache and and with his ears ringing a little bit because of the noise and because of the rape but father we pray that you would intervene in that situation right now Lord that you'll touch him father we asked your blessings on each one Lord we all had needs uplifted hands Lord heal the sick save the Lost give us a revelation more than anything because we are supernatural people that need revelation to feed off of Lord to make it through this dark and dreary world father just be with us now and take care of us in Jesus name we pray amen Daniel 921 yeah while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel who might seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation something about that evening time and he informed me and talked to me and said Oh Daniel I am now come forth to give the skill and understanding now he didn't come to give him confusion and misunderstanding he come to give him skill and understanding but the part we're have problem we're having with is when we start reading this and most of the people the message is confusion and misunderstanding God's not a master of confusion Satan is a master of confusion so if you're confused it's not God you men at the beginning of that supplications the commandment came forth and I am come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision seventy weeks are determined upon by people who is that Israel or the Jews and upon thy holy city keep those two things in mind the city is what Jerusalem to do six things and that's what we're going to talk about something today when we get to it to finish the transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in everlasting righteousness to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks and the street shall be built again in the wall even in troublous times and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city in the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with the flood and to the end of the war desolations are determined and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured out upon the desolate you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word so Daniel asked Lord what are we gonna do we're only gonna be in here two more years what are we going to do how are we going to act or what are we gonna do when we get out of this 70 years in captivity the prophet of God said he thought so much God thought so much of Daniel he just told him all the way to the consummation now what is the consummation to Israel the consummation if you look on your chart the concept the consummation of Israel is to get into that 1000 year millennial reign because that is to them not to us everybody got that same am and it is still in time time does not break and quit and leaves time is still going on for that 1000 years until we get to the white throne of judgments everybody got that same am alright you're gonna say a man long enough you won't go to sleep a man a man okay alright so something is going to happen Israel is going to be restored and the city inside that 70 weeks of Daniel it's not gonna go up brother Branstad it won't miss it one way either way it's got a starting time in this kind of stopping time everybody got that and then so if you'll just hang on to your chart make you some notes if you want to but I'll show you where that applies to because we're going to jump forward then we're gonna have to jump backwards but we won't jump backwards today we're going to review a little bit and then we're going to start into the six fold purpose because remember the six fold purpose happens during that 1260 days that the two prophets are preaching to Israel and also that is going to be in the middle of your week there you see the 1260 days then there's 1260 more days they okay with that but see most people in the message if you look at me real good real look at me around here this is what most people in the message see there's only 1260 days left after the rapture there is only 1260 days of preaching but the Bible says he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week okay and we'll explain why that that is that way and you say well I got these quotes the Bible is right face final resting places in the Word of God I don't care what prophet priest our King whatever they say if it's country to the word they're wrong now brother Brown made some statements that you say in your mind now well it sounds like he was wrong he was wrong we're wrong we did not understand what he was talking about because he can't change the Bible one more time he cannot change the Bible he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week who's he the Antichrist do we see that government made no so whatever quotes you God it's got to match the Bible I can't stand it when man starts drawing their own charts and making their own predictions and all these things that are seemingly to fulfill their own agenda I've only got one agenda is to make sure that you understand the Bible the Bible and that is clear what day an hour that we're living in and what God is doing at the present time all right so let's go back here and Jeremiah you've got some of you've got you're already got your sheet out oh they'll pull them up Josiah doing a good job putting that thing together but it let's back up and see because remember the first thing we were speaking on was the history because the history will tell us why they went into captivity now you know one thing's for sure it there's dual meaning in Scripture so if Israel fell because of something then you and I did too because redemptions not replacement it's bringing back that's what fell and we fell all right and we'll see how that connects today in bringing in that wild olive tree now Jeremiah three verse fourteen sister no backsliding children saith the Lord for I am married unto you remember Israel was God's first bride and they went whoring not physically but spiritually they went after other gods and all the things that God told them to do they didn't sound like somebody familiar sounds like me and you alright he said that I am married unto you and I will take you one of the city and two of a family and I will bring your design and I will give you pastors according to my heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding God sent them prophet after prophet after prophet after prophet after prophet one more time after profit and what they do they kill the very messenger that God sent them turn them down poor little Isaiah a young man they cut him in pieces killed him at a young age because of what why because he was prophesying against Israel telling them what they were gonna do Jeremiah 3 verse 20 says surely has a white as a wife treacherously departed from her husband so have you dealt treacherously with meal house of Israel saith the Lord now voice was heard upon the high places weeping and supplication of the children of Israel for they have perverted their way and have forgotten the Lord their God return you backsliding children and I will heal your backsliding see what God is doing he's giving them all the grace in time to come in but what did they do they turned it down and he had to give them a writing or a bill of divorcement divorcing her because she went after other gods she went and committed spiritual fornication and as we read in Jeremiah where Jeremiah says the land was polluted you can't take if your wife goes out and commits adultery you're not supposed to take her back because the land is polluted so his wife went out committed adultery he gave her a writing of divorcement but he couldn't forget Israel because he said I couldn't he said I can't forget Israel so he's not going to just totally dump her and leave her alone but here they are gonna have to go through some hardship here in Jeremiah watch Jeremiah 25 verse 4 through 12 and the Lord had sent unto you all his servants the prophets rising early and sending them but she have not hearkened nor inclines your ear to hear they said turn you again now every one from his evil way and from the evil of your doings and dwell in the land that the Lord hath given unto you and to your father's for ever and ever and go not after other gods to serve them into worship then provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands and I will do you no hurt he's trying to get him to come back same way with you and I he's trying to get us to come back but you know what we didn't hear we didn't hearken I like brother Branham so honest of a prophet he said God tried to save him at 12 years old remember that and he said I turned it now what a what a just he said no he was a yeah he was a prophet but he wasn't born again not at 12 years old he had to go through the same process we did amen yet you have not hearkened unto me saith the Lord that you might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts because you have not heard my words behold I will send and take all the families of the north's at the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant and will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants their own and against all these nations round about and will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and a hissing and perpetual desolation moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth the voice of the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the sound of the Millstone and the light of the candle and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment in these nations shall serve the king of Babel in 70 years and it shall come to pass when 70 years accomplish that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nations that the Lord for their iniquity of the land of the chaldeans then we'll make it a perpetual desolation now we know that happened when the 70 years was over that they were that came back to the homeland but will not get into that today but remember the 70 weeks of Daniel finishes up just like what he says though because there's going to be a battle of Armageddon God's going to destroy the whole all kingdoms of the earth will be destroyed because Israel has come to that 1260 days 144,000 has been saved filled with the Holy Ghost and have been taken in a rapture and then God's going to pour out the wrath of God upon the nation's that has what they hate listen every nation in the world except maybe America hates Israel they want that little place going they stuck a thorn in their side but you know what God's not going to forget that and he's not gonna forget that land either because that's where we're gonna live he thought enough of that he's gonna take his not his bride his Gentile bride we're going over there to live amen never what we read not too long ago where the prophet of God said right same spot that Abraham took communion with Melchizedek it's for the city's gonna push up what a profit that knows exactly where that's gonna happen at but thank God we had a profit they could tell us these things so second chronicles 36 17 through 21 therefore now this is chronicles talking about Israel this is telling of how Israel is going to be destroyed therefore he brought upon them the king of the child Diaz who sleet slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion upon young men are made an old man or him that stooped for age he gave them all into his hand and all the vessels of the house of God great and small the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the King and of his princes now remember Solomon has built this great temple he's built put gold and silver on everything and it was the glory days of Israel everything was wonderful but then what happened was every time God would send a prophet they would get worse because they wouldn't listen to that prophet they would get worse and they would get worse and they will get worse so God told him said I've had enough the grace of my arm has just don't that long okay same way with you and I he come to me in 1997 brother Donnie and he said my arms that long you're at the end of it same way with all of us he come to a time and he said hey that's enough you've run I've let you do whatever you want to do you can do whatever you want to do during life but listen I'm knocking today and you responded thank God we responded the right way because some will not because he has to come to everybody but he did the same thing with Israel he said I'm done I'm finished all the vessels go to the house of God great and small of the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the King and of his Prince all these he brought to Babylon and they burnt the house of God and break down the wall of Jerusalem see you've got to remember this Israel and the city so they break down the walls of Jerusalem and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof so in other words at this point in time Israel is late ruins there's nothing left of Israel are nothing left of the temple and then that escape from the sword carried he away to Babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the king of Persia to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her Sabbath's for as long as she laid desolate she kept sabbath to fulfil threescore and ten years what's threescore it's three times 20 is 60 and 10 is 70 there's your 70 years that they were in captivity alright so the Israel was in captivity for 70 years they had no city they were driven out of their land does that sound familiar because it's going to happen again during this 70 weeks of Daniel because Titus is going to do the same thing Titus is going to draw it destroy the city knock the wall down take all the things of the of the menorah and holy of holies he's going to take all that back to Rome with him and then Israel is gonna what be dispersed all over the all over the into nations but thank God there in nineteen forty something brother Brahma saw him I'll start coming by I knew he had something to do with his message had something to do with the timing now remembers and they're not gonna take they're not going to go over to Israel when we're going and say brother Brian said brother I'm said they're gonna go who is this guy they missed that forthcoming of Elijah that forthcoming is not to the Jews don't kid yourself there's a fifth coming of Elijah promised to the Jews he'll be a spirit of Moses and Elijah sure he'll have the same spirit of Elijah that brother Branham had on him but it won't be the spirit of brother Branham it'll be the spirit of Elijah on a person a Jew to go over to Israel to preach to those two prophets that's telling you before all these people well not all but several people wanting to go overseas and take the message over there that's okay you get them converted but you're not going to save 144,000 they're saved after we're gone leave them alone we need to worry about ourself cuz until we get out of here we're gonna stay here and they're not going to get their fulfillment of the scripture but guess what the Bible says we're gonna leave in a rapture and then there's 2 witnesses is going to go to Israel and going to bring them to what to their Redemption so there's 76 fold purpose as we get along in here because they come to this back room as we get finished with the background we're going to see that this 6 fold purpose happens when those 2 Jews go to Israel so let's go to Genesis 29 and yet this is just for a little bit of backup brother Branham comes in in the daniel 70 week series and he says one week equals seven years now he didn't just pull that out of his hat it's in the Bible alright he had to bring it out of the Bible he couldn't just say okay one week equals seven years well yeah sure it fit but I'm sure the the angel that was with him I'm sure he took him back to Genesis 29 and he looked and he said here you got Jacob working seven years for Rachel amen then he but he got live which was the old Jewish Church because remember they're seven churches in the Old Testament amen and there's seven churches in the New Testament he worked seven years for Leah got Leah and he's got to work seven years to get me in you the Rachel part alright but what is the saying Ginny in Genesis 29 27 2010 is's 2920 says Jacob searched seven years for Rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days free for the love he had for her then Genesis 29 27 says fulfil her week and we will give thee this also for the service which thou has served with me yet seven other years and Jacob did so and fulfilled her week what her seven years so one week equals seven years so now in the seventy weeks of Daniel and we'll get it on the chart a little bit later but this I'm just going to throw this in 70 years our seventy weeks so 70 times seven is 490 years everybody got that same am 70 times 7 so it's 70 week some Daniel it's seventy times seven because one week equals seven years so if you got seventy weeks times seven is 490 years so 490 years is the time that God is going to start and build the temple back like he promised we're going to talk about it maybe later on but not now start the temple and then he's going to finish their Redemption in this six fold purpose in this last week which has got to be 490 years that Alright 490 years and we'll get into that it's gonna require that you study though it's gonna require that you read the book it listen to the tape or go back through the history because you know brother Branham got all this a lot of his dates and stuff from history books alright but I gave you that chart that you can use and then I've got the other chart that brother Branham drew now will give it out next Sunday but it's the chart that brother Branham drew that Becky his daughter member graphed off to give to the people and it was verified by George Smith that I asked him myself me and dad both did he looked at the picture and you can tell it was typed back in the 60s because it's the old typewriter typing alright and the little and a little bitty well it was supposed to bend the King you know they had the head of gold and the brass and and if you if you're reading your if you listen to the three tape somewhere in there brother branham I think it's them the last one he says Becky it looks like a girl and it does it looks like a girl with a dress on so it's the same identical chart that brother Branham drew and then we have another one somewhere I got to find it where brother Branham drew the same chart on a napkin for a brother the next day at a motel or a meeting at a restaurant so you know we don't want to chain what I'm saying is we're not going to change the chart you can't change the chart to match the Bible that chart matches exactly what the Bible says if not then brother Brown is false why do people why is the first thing that people when they get ready to you know say sayonara to the message what are they the first thing you do well brother Brown was wrong in Daniels in two weeks well no he wasn't he was a prophet he didn't waste three services to be wrong you saw well when the seals opened up will show me one time get bring me one quote where brother branham said because I'm gonna tell you in in the seven seals we just went through them every seal he said I was wrong here I was wrong here this was not what I was thinking this was not remember the fifth seal Jew he thought was us the first seal he thought was a wild horse rider he said I was wrong I was wrong I was wrong show me one time he said I was wrong in Daniel 70 weeks and now this will correct it he always goes back and says see we had to get these Daniel 70 weeks out of the way and you said well I got quote I don't care about you quotes quotes will kill you they verbatim quoted Moses to Jesus and he said your of your father they had Moses his quote book they had ever how many sermons Moses preached they had them all we be of Moses we be of Abraham Jesus said you're of your father the devil so be careful what you're what you're talking about and I'm not trying to be hard I'm just going to tell you that we got a this thing's got to be the old saying was we got to put this thing to bed we got to put this thing where there is no fear people fear less dad said this morning people fear Daniel seventy weeks and they fear the seals I don't fear him at all you know why they fear them because it hadn't been talked whatever that brother has said we don't need teaching anymore he's problem is he's just hanging out enough or he'd have never said that and you know what it does get like I said last Sunday I used Michael for an example you know Michael said he did not like getting up go to school every day school is hard you know playing basketball or baseball that's easy and fun but you know what you gotta go school too so we got to go to school here this may be long drawn-out boring process but you know what it will I believe this time will answer your question because we're going to take it by the Bible and the Bible is faced final resting place it's in the Word of God so let's go to Daniel 9 verse 1 and look next on you quotes we read it last Sunday because last Sunday we spoke on Daniels confession brother Branham said Daniels confession is what brought Gabriel on the scene so maybe if we'll start praying we can get Michael here and then we can get we can get Michael because remember Gabriel is to Israel Gabriel is the announcing angel to Israel Michael is our angel a man Michael is our angel which is Christ so Daniel 9 1 in the year first year of Darius the son of a source of the seat in the Mirta Meade's which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans in the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of years where the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem and I set my face into the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting and sack cloth and ashes you see how he got an answer from God maybe if we did the same thing we might get an answer from God but he said his face and he said God what are you talking about well and got two more years I understood by books do you understand by books Daniel 9 verse 19 Oh Lord here o Lord forgive Oh Lord hearken and do defer not for thine own sake o my god for thy City and thy people look how many times he connects him in the city the people in the city because when we get into this Daniel 70 weeks with the dates and the times and where everybody says this is wrong and this is this is not what he's saying and all this all this stuff remember he has to restore the people and the city that city is very important because what are they doing now they're over there now trying their best to establish temple worship because if they can get the red heifer if they can get the holy of holies if they can get that menorah back and set that temple up they they the Jews think that the Messiah can come because of what they're doing okay so but we know one thing's for sure the 144,000 they're gonna get saved and they're gonna go in there and say hey that you don't need this when you understand what's gonna happen they're gonna get mad at him o Lord hear o Lord forgive the Lord hearken and do defer not for their own sake o my god for thy city and thy people are called by thy name and while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sins and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my god yet while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel who might seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation we read that a few minutes ago and he informed me and talked with mr. doe Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding at the beginning of my supplication the commandment came forth and I am come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision now let's start with the quotes and let's read them just for a few minutes and this just get a background the first quote here brother Branham says in the Gables instructions annual now there's our lessons for the next three four or five meetings wherever the Lord will reveal seventy of weeks now I'll ask dr. people tonight to put up my board there so I'll be able to mark it down I don't want you to miss it now you've got to study with me and study deep or you'll miss it and I want to draw it out here on the blackboard and then you bring your pencils and paper and write down these dates these times and all about it now the seventy of weeks begins now get this after the church is taken out now everybody understands that say Amen be careful be careful because you look at this and if you read this just this wife said quote will kill you the 70 weeks begins after the church is taken out now if you take what he said that's not true 70 weeks began at 606 BC and consummates on this chart here but if you'll get this key you will understand every quote that you think in your brain right now that's going through your brain that brother Brown said there's only three and a half years left I know that there is there's only 1260 days left of a Ministry of Jesus Christ but that's not the whole week as 1260 days because the Bible said that there's one week left after the rapture so you got to make everything fit but now what's he doing he's bringing all of the 70 weeks begins after the church is taken out because the first part those 69 weeks Israel is truly not being totally restored only in this last week that you've got in your hand is God going to send two people over there and they're going to be brought back by preaching of 1260 days there's two prophets going to redeem the people of Israel everybody got that same man okay so then you know there's quotes were they people ask him is about the seven years he said no no no nenene no it's the last half well it is the last half is the last half of the of the week of the Messiah ministry he's already had three and a half when he was on earth and he's got three and a half for the Jews but that's not the last week because the Bible says there's one week left after the rapture and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week you can't change that Bible right there and who's he he is the Antichrist because God don't break a covenant man breaks a covenant God does not break a covenant this man shall confirm the covenant for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease so in other words he breaks the covenant so that's what that's the Antichrist and do we see that sign no my prophet of God tells us we do not we will not be here he said if you see that beast sign that treaty with Israel you missed the rapture and the Bible says and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week are seven years we could stop right there cuz they were I guess I'm like you I'm gonna tell y'all like I told those preachers keep bringing me everything you bring me I'm gonna bring you right back to that one Scripture right there explain that scripture to me first and then I'll listen to all this other stuff you got to say but of course they don't anymore and that's okay now 70 weeks begins now get this after the church is taken out because remember God cannot restore Israel while we're still here can't work with both of us at the same time so we've got to be taken out of the way the wild olive branch has got to be taken all the way so God is going to deal with Israel for that last week or seven years that you have here they're okay with that I don't care it doesn't matter to me if you believe it but are you okay with the one I'm saying okay because if you say I don't agree with that I'm gonna go back to Daniel 9:27 and he shall confirm to come out with many for one week there's no half weeks in Daniel 70 weeks find me one they're all full weeks okay so everybody understand that say man so the church is gone because look watch watch this revelation 6:1 - revelations 1921 paragraph 71 it's connected with the 70 of weeks therefore we must stop and explain before we go further we must stop and explain while these 70 of weeks because if you don't you'll miss those seals you'll miss the trumpets what you'll miss the placing of them alright they all happen in this last week to the Jews cuz look do we see the plagues no we're already gone do we get the trumpets no they're to Israel we're already gone the last whoa you better not be here on that last whoa you'll be in the third world war so we're gone from revelation 6:1 to 1921 the bride's not even the earth hello I like key three hello hello somebody hello somebody print scenes are good hello somebody but it's not we get the spiritual application of revelations for one to revelations 1921 because 1921 this is where we come back right here hey buddy look at your chart don't look at me we come back right here when this millennium begins we have come riding back into the millennium according to revelations 1921 but it's not to us we come back here it's what it's why we come back here is the bride we come back here it's not servants we don't come back here to fulfill any time hey when we take a body change here we have time no longer we don't have to have without that thousand years is not to us that last week is not to us okay so maybe you'll understand a little bit more of what we're going through here because brother Brown said we must stop if you don't you'll miss those seals you missed the trumpets you'll miss the vowels you'll miss the plagues these three unclean spirits like frogs the three woes the casting out of the red dragon and the woman in the Sun that's all Israel sure we get a spiritual application of it you'll miss it all if you don't cuz it takes place right here in this 70th week the one you got in your hand that's the last week that this you're looking at revelation I mean Daniel 9:27 what you're holding in your hand is Daniel 9:27 and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week right here got it cuz remember we go in the rapture right here Gentile rapture Church ages are over we go in a rapture because we have to go in a rapture so that God can go deal with the Jews all right we are not here when God deals with the Jews let me say that one more time God will not deal with us in Israel at the same time Israel has to be our homeland and we have to be gone in the rapture before that last week can take place with brother Brett said it all takes place in that 70th week not that half week didn't say the sixty nine and a half one like most people in the message believe and I hate it but if you're just not been talked cuz brother branham I'm not gonna change a quote he's got and I'm not gonna have to change the Bible for what we're talking about here but I have seen and said in ministers meeting where preachers totally change charts bring scripture in that don't have nothing to it just being totally illiterate about what's going on I told somebody I said you know it's it's kind of like you know you're a big prize fighter and and all of a sudden you know you're Muhammad Ali and all of a sudden Michael Bernoulli at 18 years old or whoever Agios walks up to Muhammad Ali and squares him right in the nose and knocks him on the ground Muhammad Ali is ill because some little pipsqueak popped him in the face when he wasn't supposed to right we've all been that way and what the first thing we do we come out fighting we just start flailing and jabbing away but maybe that's what happened now the prophet Daniel meeting paragraph 72 I had been in babbling for 68 years you want to run references back and save yourself some of the time they've had of looking it up sixty-eight years he went into captivity in BC 606 now here's where we're gonna start with the dates just keep that in your mind we'll do the dates a little bit later but there's one of your markers and when the vision came to him it was BC 538 538 from 606 least 68 68 years have been in babbling amongst healings and still had the victory we can't stay an hour he said that I didn't we can't stay an hour number two cables instructions to Daniel the prophet of God said this is the one most important scriptures in the Bible what does it do it tells the closing of the Jewish nation the Jewish people this scripture the seventy of weeks it's discloses and tells exactly from the time that Daniel started there until the end of the consummation of what I tell you the end the consummation is right here this is when Israel is fully restored is when they start this 1000 year millennial reign that's when they've got their people back that's when you've got us back there that's when they've got that Millennial temple built and we're fixing to take a thousand years of millennial reign thereby okay with that all right so maybe he's heard this over and over but some have not so just act like you haven't heard them heard it before it's one of the most important scriptures in the book what does it do it tells the closing of the Jewish nation the Jewish people this scripture the seventy of weeks it discloses and tells exactly from the time that Daniel started there until the end of the consummation is one of the greatest time pizzas how many heard me say if you want to know what day of the week it is look at the calendar if you want to know what time we're living in watch the Jews that's right there's God's calendar taken from right here anything loads in any Bible scholar anyone will tell you that this is the time peace the Jews all right number three Gables instructions to Daniel Israel's returning to her homeland what day that God determines Israel to be a nation no not when the UN decided it because that was 1947-48 sorry they started in 47 and then made it in 48 you're right thank you sister Trudy but not when they decided this is when God determines Israel to be a nation that's the day that they'll never be another Gentile saved I'll prove that by the seventy of weeks if I can only find them days I'm going over to get the astronomy calendar and the Julian and the astronomy and the Roman and all of them there's somewhere somewhere there's something God knows about it and that he is able to reveal it I know the Julian calendar has 365 and a quarter days in the year so all they're all mixed up but there's a truth somewhere alright brother branham debt if you don't know the story behind it he preached Gables instructions to Daniel Sunday morning he preached the six fold purpose Sunday night and then the next Sunday week the next week Sunday he preached the 70th week and put all the dates in the times at this time right now he doesn't have them he's just doing like we're doing he's just sending a foundation to build on all right look at number four Gables instructions to Daniel the Jew that we know that's not the real Jew the real Jews that real Orthodox who has not defiled himself with the things of the world who's not went out and joined of the churches that's the one that's returning you under living on cheese and bread upon the hillsides not allowed in the old city did you know that the Orthodox was not allowed in the old city I had to build them a city on this side in the no-man's land with machine guns pointing both ways but she's beginning to put forth her buds a man and a man the time as a hymn there's Ishmael and Isaac standing there fussing about the land yet but she belongs to Israel if you happen to go over in the New Jerusalem they won't let you come to the old Jerusalem you'll have to go there first and let them explain it all to you the Arabs then take you to over to the other side that's its most children but wait there's coming a time when God's children's gonna take her over that's right he's not talking about us he's talking about Israel we're not gonna take over a city our city we don't have one remember Abraham didn't have one he was looking for one all right Jerusalem will be rebuilt again the daily sacrifice will be set up and the Antichrist will make a covenant for them last seven weeks now he didn't make a mistake there because it's seven years in ain't seven weeks its last seven years everybody got that say man okay I'm not trying to change anything but that's what he's talking about because last seven years that put 49 years after the rapture that don't that's not right okay and in the midst of it he'll break that covenant and turn them all into the Kosta Tallis ISM the abomination will spread over the whole thing like that and then the end shall be watch everybody got that say man all right you okay with that all right let's start now here we'll just for a few minutes with the six full purpose and then we'll if this is enough of a stage to set I believe till we can start in the six fold purpose we'll read one of them today and not be so long six full purpose 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to do these six things so inside of Daniel 70 weeks everybody look at me inside of Daniel 70 weeks these six things have to happen that just that's just plain English read it seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in everlasting righteousness to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy that six things has to happen inside of the seventy weeks of Daniel everybody got that same n now I want to ask you a question if as most people believe look at your chart now most people in dimensions believe there's only three and a half years left after the rapture to fulfil the seventy weeks of Daniel do you hear me what I'm saying that is false let me read Daniel 9:27 again and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week not a half a wait one week because I want to ask you a question if all six of these things brother a if all six of these things have to be finished inside of that 490 years our seventy weeks everybody got that that's what the Bible says these six things has to happen to restore Israel in the city because what happens right here in verse 25 it says know therefore and understand what he's beginning to tell us all the way that it's going to happen but in Daniel 9:24 he tells you the whole thing this is what's going to happen there's 70 weeks determined to do these six things now I want to ask you a question if as most people in the message believe and I say 99% of them that right here for you look at your chart right here is the middle of the week 1260 days is half it's Trina half years according to the to the calendar dr. Julie encounter calendars do okay with that all right now that's all if they say them then what they're saying is is that's the end of the 70 weeks of Daniel now how in the name of the good Lord are you gonna have a battle of Armageddon right here right but if you take all six and put them in the seventy weeks last they say you got to bring in everlasting righteousness before the Tribulation Period I mean before the Battle of Armageddon can't have you can't seal up the vision and prophecy brother Brown says in the North the most holy means we're riding in the Millennium because we are the anointing to the temple that's way over here so they can't be three and a half years left of time they might understand me time there's not three and a half years of time left there's seven years according to Daniel 9:27 I'm gonna keep reading that and you're gonna hate me afterward but I really don't care and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week one week and in the midst of the week he's gonna step in and say I'm done you know what and so is the two prophets they're gonna say alright our 1260 days are done we're going in a rapture but he's gonna bring in everlasting righteousness he's gonna sell the vision and prophecy and who's gonna anoint the most holy that can't happen on this side of the Battle of Armageddon everybody get that can't happen so there's seven years of time left there's only three and a half years of a prophecy of two prophets to Israel that's according to the Bible but according to Daniel 9:27 there's one week left after the rapture brother Brown says it's seven times in the book that there's one week left after the rapture with what they're not getting is they're not getting that that's the time element the time element of the 70 weeks has to bring us to the consummation that the consummation no that's the consummation that's when Ezekiel 43 44 the Millennial temple will be built by the Jews and then we ride into that millenium temple they gotta have a time to build it so bring me whatever quote you want there alright if you'll place it in the right place because the Bible's no we're not gonna change the Bible he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he calls the sacrifice and oblation deceased but there's no way that six fold purpose can be fulfilled only in those 1260 days can happen how can you bring in everlasting righteousness and then destroy everything cuz if you'll welcome we'll give you the other chart that little line right there is when the Battle of Armageddon is going to start that's a nuclear destruction that's going to destroy what this world you know of it's gonna destroy it so how you gonna bring in everlasting righteousness over here and then destroy it how you gonna seal up the vision and prophecy in the people and destroy them how you gonna know what the most totally over here and then destroy him can't happen when I started reading this brother Dale the first thing said he said make sure you get the six fold purpose right he said if you get it right he said you'll get your chart right and you'll get what brother Branham meant you'll get it right because of the six fold purpose and I believe that's what we're we're starting on now so look number five in two men the first thing we wish to draw your attention to is the infallibility of God's Word God keeps his word to the letter and tonight we want to fasten our thought on that let God keeps his word we can rest assure of anything that God has said in his word to be the truth and faith does not rest upon the shifting sands of men's idea or mans theology everybody say amen to that amen but it has its final resting place on the unmovable rock of God's eternal word the word number six God hiding himself in simplicity and remember that's the same spirit from the days of Noah that said there's no rain up there we can shoot the moon with instruments and there's no rain but if God said there would be rain there for faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things that's not seen and faith takes its final resting place on the Word of God that's where it finds its resting place I just want to bring those two quotes in there to tell you that we're gonna base everything we have on the Word of God amen we got to take it back to the Word of God if it doesn't fit then we're wrong we're wrong prophet is not wrong Bible's not wrong we're on all right if we get it wrong somewhere in there's got to be the right brother Branham did not spend three to our services to be wrong he was so confident I'll show you many many quotes he's so confident even says it's that's that the Lord yet the people want to tear it to pieces but if you'll put your faith in the Word of God and read what the Bible says you'll know what that prophet said all right and that's what we're gonna do as we go on through this 70 weeks of Daniel 6 fold purpose number seven seventy weeks are determined upon thy people for what purpose whose people was it determined upon Daniel's people the Jews and what was it determined for upon not only Daniel but upon Daniel's holy city Daniels holy city now class what was Daniel's holy city congregation says Jerusalem alright so now I wrote myself a little note you can read it there's redemption of the Jews and the city so we've got to take both because if you don't take both then you're gonna get the six fold purpose wrong again because how you gonna build a Millennial temple over here during the same time the two witnesses are here which is not which is not which is contrary to the Bible and then the Battle of Armageddon you're gonna destroy it all can't have God's not gonna build a temple and then destroy amen so there's got to be an answer but the brim said there's got to be an answer somewhere six full purpose number eight now I want to know friends that's striking on these things I'm certainly leaving out weeks of teaching but just kind of hitting it so that when the weather cools off oh I wish you would hear two are a little later when we get into those seals vowels trumpets all these things that I can refer back and say do you remember on the seventy weeks of Daniel do you remember the church age when it went up and what taking place and these seven weeks of Daniel 70 weeks of Daniel covers from the going up of the church until the coming back of the church that space is what it covers now not only seventy weeks of Daniel part of it because remember the 70 weeks of Daniel beginning 606 BC to get all the things back together to come up to this time to where the Messiah has to come because it says in Daniel 9 we're just saying Daniel 9:26 and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off you got to bring them a sign in there and you got to have him cut off from the Jews to bring it in to us the Gentiles okay everybody all right now not all 70 weeks of Daniel part of it 70 weeks are determined now there's a six fold purpose to his visit telling him what was going to come to pass now there's a six full purpose of his coming now tonight I think they'll leave off well here in the scriptures of we're weird with that this morning there's a six fold purpose now continuing down 70 weeks are determined he starts reading the scripture upon thy people now remember that is all the journey of Israelites will have on this earth they are determined seventy weeks is just determined that's all that's lauded to the Jews so there's only the 490 years lauded to the Jews everybody got that not no halves no thirds no force 70 weeks right upon thy people and upon thy holy city therefore this 70 weeks this is brother Branham interpolating now don't miss it it will reveal from that time to the end of the Jews and also to the end of Jerusalem until they be a new city built because remember go back to your Bible what happens with the mosque of Omar which is right in the middle of the new city of Jerusalem prophet of God said they'll drop a bomb right in the middle of that thing and blow it to pieces well that's gonna completely destroy the old city because it's got to be destroyed this new millennial temple is new it's a new temple oh you'll get something if you'll just you just gotta just think just think think think and you'll get this therefore there's 70 weeks now don't miss it it will reveal from that time to the end of the Jews and also to the end of Jerusalem until there'll be a new city built so now if Daniel 70 weeks ends right here lightin 99 percent of the people in the message believe where are you gonna build a new city yet gotta have time time time we're talking about time Jews or a time peace you and I are not we're eternal creatures they are a time peace alright cuz look we've had we've had from the time Christ died until today as Gentiles to receive messages right there was no time but now remember Israel when them two prophets start preaching they preach 1260 days that's it this thing ain't going on no further the Bible says we'll read it in a few minutes the Bible says in Revelations where's 11 says I'll give my power to two witnesses and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth and ashes that's all they get they get a time until there's a new city built now I hope we get into it real good and eat tonight or determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to do what number one is finish the transgression so let's read what brother Branham says about that and then we will review it back next Sunday and starting we try to get all the six in real quick here six full purpose the gables visit to Daniel number nine now if we get back into Daniel again we'll find out that in Daniel we find out here the twenty fourth verse to finish the transgression to finish white to finish Israel's transgression what is they transgress it is to go against something what did I just tell you back in in Chronicles and all that God sent all them prophets every time they'd send them a prophet Israel would just be contrary they wouldn't they transgress they did they didn't want it it's to go against something what they go against they didn't go against them prophets remember that one prophet said god they're not listening to me God told the Prophet it's not you they turned down it's me they're turning down can we be doing the same thing today turning down the very thing it's going to change us and get us out of here a transgress against me is to do groan do wrong to me transgress against you is to do a wrong to you so Israel did a wrong to God and in this 70th week not half in this 70th week what's going to happen God is going to finish the transgression of Israel finish the transgression we'll be turning away the ungodliness from Jacob and then all Israel will be born again all of them will receive the Holy Ghost everybody got that finish the transgression will turn away the ungodliness from Jacob that's your first part of the seventh of the six fold purpose because they did they transgress they turned him down they said no we don't want it so through two prophets what's going to happen do two prophets they're going to turn right around and they're going to point them not to Matthew Mark Luke and John at the moment hey Israel can read the New Testament now the literal New Testament Israel can read it now they just don't believe it right but they believe that Old Testament so when you go over in the Old Testament you take two prophets Moses and Elijah and you go over there and they start preaching they're gonna preach Christ out of the Old Testament bring him into the New Testament and say you missed this man because remember they're going to preach Christ so much to the it to Israel - over there and I can't maybe he's not in Ezekiel but it's over there somewhere where he's they say where did you get those scars he said in the house of my friends they preach Christ so much and so real don't you know what Christ is not gonna be there but Christ is not here standing in front of you today but the Spirit of Christ is there's a spirit of Christ that standing here trying to teach you something okay and it's up to you to take you to receive it or fall asleep or do whatever you're doing so but this has nothing to do with us this is Israel our Redemption we have a six fold purpose for our Redemption it's called seal number one number two number three number four number five number six what's the first seal first seal we covered it is a wild horse rider but it also types what justification what's God trying to do what's God trying to do he's trying to justify Israel because you know what he justified you so much whatever you did in the past every how much you turn guard down ever how much happened if you're truly justified God has forgot that and he'll never bring it up again so same way with Israel God's to two prophets are going to save and fill those 144,000 with the Holy Ghost through justification through sanctification and through the baptism of the Holy Ghost they're gonna see that's why I got that right here there's only three processes of grace remember justification sanctification about kissing the Holy Ghost justification did he not finish her transgression the day he justified you didn't can't hold one thing against you if you're truly justified cannot hold one thing those who he has justified he is already glorified but all Israel will be born again all of them will receive the holy spirit now let's read Romans 11 because this brings in the ungodliness from Jacob watch for if God spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee behold therefore the goodness and severity of God on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise they'll also shall be cut off now remember this is the story of the olive tree now who is the olive tree Israel is the olive tree Israel olive tree has branches but there was a wild olive tree you're looking at him and everybody says they meant and they'll same to you and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed in for God is able to graft them in again now what is he saying he's taking the regular olive tree because what happened was if you'll go back in the Old Testament God whacked the branches off of that olive tree which was Israel cut her off divorced her I just read it to you divorced her and put her away but now he's able to graft them in again he's going to right here under 1260 days he's now dealing with this people right here though watch for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and we're graft contrary to nature into a good olive tree that's us how much more show these which be the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree God cut Israel off for tooth for seven Church ages grafted in a wild olive tree me and you the Gentiles grafted in a wild olive tree but God's not going to kill the tree the tree is still an olive tree what are we doing we're living off the life of that olive tree amen but God's not going to kill the tree he's going to take us in a rapture and he's going to graph the right back in that's what he says right here and how much more shall these which be the natural branch be graphed into their own olive tree for I would not brethren that should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in they're blinded right now so they can't you can't finish the transgression somebody's blind God's got to open their eyes but he only opens their eyes when you and I leave through two prophets and so all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins he's starting the process of bringing Israel not back to wife again can't do it he's divorced her she's already went out another man's he can't take her back but he can bring her to a place and restore her to a place that 144,000 can live in that temple within that city with us but they're not bribed their servants and then untold millions and billions of Jews what about the fifth seal Jew they get eternal life and they didn't care whether Jesus was Christ or whatever he was because God blinded them right here blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in he's gonna lift it off of their eyes two prophets are gonna prophesy and they're gonna receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost which will make them servants he justifies them by these three processes of finishing transgression make an end of sin and make reconciliation for their iniquity let's read revelations 11:1 and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying arise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles and the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months what is forty two months I'm gonna wait till somebody says what it is three and a half years thank you okay and I will give power D Anika to figured that one out and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy 1260 days or three scores three times twenty clothed in sackcloth so 1260 days it's three and a half years according to the Jewish calendar thereby got that same man according to 30 days to a month that's where brother Brennan found his date set he went back and found what God's calendar a man not the Jewish I mean not the Julian calendar not the Roman calendar it's always 165 them and or 365 and a quarter and all these different things but God's real calendar is 360 days to a year so we're starting on the six fold purpose I want you to look at that chart just keep it remember one thing's for sure we're not I'm not trying to be a smart aleck by no means I just want us to see it I've had so many people some of them some of the quests most questions you get asked when you go somewhere is about Daniel 70 weeks especially if you make mention of it because it's not being preached I'm it's just not it's not being preached it's being preached more by denominational people in my heavens they've got it all different kind of things they've got an brother branham will covered if you'll read your 6 Pope I mean you're Gabriel instructions to Daniel that the Millerites thought it was 1919 or 1917 somewhere in there and they turned in to be seventh-day Adventist he tells you the whole story but they went up on a mountain and had wanes they thought the rapture was gonna take place because they had figured out that Daniel 70 weeks was gonna end by some date in 1919 brother Brahim said I can tell you something happened in 1919 he said but it wasn't that hey man so we we got a prophet that's gonna tell us exactly what that Bible says he's not gonna deviate one bit from the Bible he cannot deviate from the Bible or he is a false prophet and we know he's not I know he's not what you have to decide whether you know not annoyed let's stand our feet musicians come you just pray about this we've been over this I know we went to it about three or four years ago brother Dale's been going over since 1974 so talk about an old lesson for him that's an old lesson for him but if you'll get it solid you won't be shook cuz I downstairs we're reading in Hebrews the Bible says he'll and I'll only shape the earth again he's going to shake the heaven and the earth and that's what he's gonna do now he's gonna shake everything but you know what a shaking does a shaking gets all the rats out gets all the dust man you see good shaking you'll see the dust falling you'll see all kind of stuff fall well that's what's gonna happen God's gonna shake this thing one last time if you built on a solid rock you can't be shaken you might feel a little tremor every once in a while but you know what if you're standing on a solid rock you're not gonna be shaken face final resting place is where in that word of God rock down let's sing a song keep praying for brother Dale whose long so glad I'm your thank you for all these people that are taking over two brothers and sister their elders [Music] [Music] and set me free so glad and keep him safe [Music] I'm your aren't you go ahead [Music] Oh [Applause] I follow me so glad you find [Applause] [Music] they go so glad I'm your own soul one more time so by mu [Music] I'm you so live hi so all of you Hey so or so go to mind affairs what would a father be if you asked for bread and he give you a rock that's for fish and he give you a scorpion we're children of God living way below our privileges we have a problem or anything in our life take it to the Father like we were talking about this morning you know it I believe brother Dale has has made us good rough Christians what we don't have to cry out for brother Dale to pray for us ever ever five minutes and he's listening now he'll know because they're listening going up the road that he's built a group of people that are rough he's rough on us they ain't no doubt but you know what is on him miss love its correction and if we don't take correction to Bibles plane what we are so if it's sent out of love like it is then we need to take it as love but let's not be sniffling babbling babies anymore grow up grow up in God you in your closet at home you ask for God to give you don't say now if I can get to church and get brothers that's not in the Bible no we're in the Bible of this thing you got to go find a preacher to pray for you the Bible says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover doesn't say you got to pray it just says lay hands how many times your brother Dale done that many times somebody say I got a backache or something he'll go outside and shake your hand and if he'll put that hand on your back or on your shoulder and he's praying for you without nobody ever knowing that said to me that's what it is you know you have all the emotion you want to but I want results and I believe we're getting results because God's doing what he said he would do he's gonna build a group of people that'll be able to stand the pressure of this endtime not a bunch of babbling babies but some real true hardened battle-hardened brother Brown said battle-scarred veterans that's what God wants and that's what we're gonna be we just gotta keep pressing on keep pressing on those who endure to the end shall be saved I'll promise you endure keep enduring pray for us all so I'm leaving in the morning real early and head in Illinois for about four days so I'll be back on Thursday so just keep me in prayers and brother daily then we'll be back tomorrow but let's pray for brother Dale Roberts that God will not just bring him out of what he's in but to bring him out of all that you know he was paralyzed there before he went before he fell so we're just gonna pray that God's gonna restore all that because we're gonna ask we're gonna take that petition to the Heavenly Father we're not gonna have to go through 14 dead Saints we're not Catholics we come boldly to the throne of grace if you can't come boldly to the throne of grace you need to come up here and we sure enough need to pray for you because you got something on you that you need to get off if you can't go bow it to the throne of grace by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then let's don't be weak Christians let's be real strong stout Christians so god bless you let's bow our heads Damle father thank you Lord for this day afraid of what we've said Lord to be meaningful to the people because we tried our best to give them what you've already told us Lord to the 66 books of this wonderful infallible Bible that was written by the Holy Ghost through several different individuals but it all comes out to be the infallible Word of God we also Lord brought in the Prophet that you sent us in the end time to help us to bring clarity to what you've already said father not to confuse us Lord if we're confused father we know us to devil because he's the master of confusion so we pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you would push all that back Lord that will understand in the coming days what's being brought to us that we're being molded and made into an image not of jell-o not of powder but an image of a rock of stone a revelation by the beaver brother Dale Roberts Lord bring him out of
