[19:42] in on that tape that you're making that
[19:45] was that was real good amen right we're
[19:49] going to have a little bit different
[19:50] service this afternoon because we want
[19:52] to have the ordination service so you
[19:54] can go ahead and be seated and uh
[19:58] you know we just going to have an
[20:00] ordination service for brother Bob we
[20:02] have uh done as the scripture says you
[20:06] know and uh many many of you brothers
[20:09] are qualified for for being a deacon and
[20:12] things and but we chose brother Bob to
[20:15] uh put him into a place to to be able to
[20:17] fulfill the office and be with Terrence
[20:20] and uh Wade in the the being of the
[20:22] deacons of the church and it's a it's an
[20:25] honorable position and a you know and so
[20:28] just uh you know we thank God that we
[20:30] can we can depend on people and their
[20:34] doings in the offices of the church and
[20:36] stuff like that and we just we just
[20:38] appreciate brother Bob in his stand and
[20:41] he's been a a good brother for many
[20:43] years with us and you know so he he fits
[20:46] the bill of what we have need of so if
[20:48] brother Bob would come and if Wade and
[20:51] Terrence and Aaron would come on to
[20:54] minister Brethren and we'll just have a
[20:56] a time of ordinate ordination of our
[20:59] brother as a deacon and then you know
[21:03] we'll go on into the Fulfillment of the
[21:05] service I was just going to read the
[21:07] scriptures now actually in a technical
[21:11] sense a bishop and a deacon has the same
[21:14] qualifications but uh when you deal with
[21:16] the the bishop to going into the
[21:18] ministry you got a you know a part that
[21:21] uh you could do so we will just read the
[21:23] part that's related to doing if you
[21:26] remember the story comes in the book of
[21:28] Acts uh chapter 1 they were having uh
[21:31] problems with daily necessities and The
[21:34] Works around there and the handling of
[21:36] everything is as brother randam called
[21:38] him a a deacon said he's a he's a police
[21:40] officer you know to take care of things
[21:43] and and to try to do and help all of
[21:45] them and and they set aside seven men
[21:48] and they laid hands on them and prayed
[21:50] for them you know and ordained them as
[21:52] uh the first deacons you know for the
[21:55] for the job and uh so then let's just
[21:57] read the scripture if we will here in U
[22:00] act I mean excuse me in 1 Timothy 1
[22:04] we'll begin reading at verse
[22:06] 8 you can read back up before like I
[22:09] said the bishop and the Deacon is runs
[22:11] together you know but it we'll just read
[22:13] the part of the deacon likewise must the
[22:15] deacons be
[22:16] grave not double tonged not given to
[22:19] much wine not greedy of filthy lucer
[22:23] hold in the mystery of the faith and a
[22:24] pure conscience let these also first be
[22:28] proved then let them use the office of a
[22:31] deacon being found
[22:32] blameless even so must their wives be
[22:35] grave not slanderous sober faithful in
[22:39] all things let the deacons be the
[22:41] husbands of one wife ruling their
[22:44] children in their own house well for
[22:46] they that have used the office of a
[22:49] deacon will purchase to themselves a
[22:51] good degree and great boldness in the
[22:54] faith which is in Christ Jesus
[22:58] like I say we believe that brother Bob
[23:00] fits in this and all and we we certainly
[23:03] appreciate him and look forward to
[23:05] working with him and the the Lord and
[23:08] and everything you know and so now you
[23:10] know who he is and you know who the
[23:12] deacons are and they are the policeman
[23:15] and that's not just all of their job but
[23:17] they are the policeman of the church and
[23:20] if something goes wrong and they come
[23:21] and correct you well just remember
[23:25] they're correcting you because of their
[23:27] job
[23:28] if your children does something wrong
[23:30] and one of the deacons gets on to them
[23:32] then you get your feelings hurt you'll
[23:33] have to deal with me because I've always
[23:36] stood with the deacons I know
[23:38] maybe some before might have thought I
[23:41] didn't but I've always stood it doesn't
[23:43] matter whether it's my kids my grandkids
[23:46] my great grandkids my you know my family
[23:49] that has nothing to do with if these
[23:51] deacons correct you you line up and then
[23:55] you say well they didn't have a right to
[23:57] do that will they do because it's their
[24:00] job if they see something going wrong
[24:01] out here you know some problem some
[24:04] little something happening they have the
[24:06] full authority to correct you and like I
[24:09] said if you get your feelings hurt
[24:10] you're going to have to deal with me
[24:11] about it because that's that's the
[24:14] offices to help me to where I don't have
[24:16] to be outside and running things and and
[24:19] doing things and then I can just say to
[24:21] them go take care this and let them
[24:23] handle their job so you respect them and
[24:26] you pray for them
[24:28] because that's that's their job and
[24:30] that's the the part that they need to to
[24:32] be and we just we appreciate brother Bob
[24:34] and we'll just just go ahead and the
[24:37] prophet I've read up a good bit on you
[24:38] know over the years of of the ordaining
[24:41] and things and and it's simply just like
[24:43] any other we we lay hands on him to show
[24:48] our part of love one to the other all
[24:51] right and showing that we you know fully
[24:54] respect him for the job and all and
[24:57] believe that he is the one and we just
[25:00] ordain him to be into that
[25:02] position and then to walk there in and
[25:04] that's a great reward you know there's a
[25:07] great reward that goes with it sometimes
[25:08] as I said you may have to
[25:10] correct you know you may have to do
[25:13] something that you wouldn't want to do
[25:15] but just remember you're doing it for
[25:17] the Lord and the work in his church all
[25:20] right father we thank you for our
[25:24] brother we thank you that he has father
[25:27] made what we believe is the
[25:28] qualifications of this office of a
[25:31] deacon and we just agree here with the
[25:34] ministry of the church and the deacons
[25:36] and all and we agree Lord that our
[25:39] brother is Honorable respected and Lord
[25:43] he fits the place that we have a need of
[25:45] we ask you now that you would just be
[25:47] with him Lord and give him the the right
[25:50] attitude and the right Spirit of all
[25:52] things that he Lord may be able to
[25:55] fulfill his job and Lord help us to
[25:58] honor that that no matter if he was to
[26:00] correct me Lord let me stand the
[26:04] correction and let us all line up to
[26:06] walk in you because that's what we're
[26:08] ordaining offices for and and things
[26:11] that we may Lord be right in order of
[26:15] the word and following after what you
[26:17] said we just lay our hands upon our
[26:19] brothers showing the congregation that
[26:21] we agree with him and he set aside for
[26:23] this office and Lord that he's the
[26:26] Deacon of the Lord
[26:28] in Jesus name amen amen amen God bless
[26:32] you brother God
[26:37] bless let's stand
[26:40] together we appreciate our brother and
[26:42] I'm sure he'll do the work amen now what
[26:45] we're going to do we're going to play
[26:47] the message because the other day my
[26:50] wife and I were sitting there and uh
[26:52] listening to this message and uh you
[26:55] know that's what we do we uh we kind of
[26:57] developed you know a thing of where we
[27:00] we have a good bit of time together and
[27:02] I enjoy that cuz you know we do spend a
[27:04] lot of time together we spend all day
[27:06] and then all night and and we'll be
[27:08] sitting there and listening to tapes and
[27:11] and you know doing things together and
[27:14] uh we were just listening to this and on
[27:16] communion and uh because that's what I
[27:19] do a lot of times I'll just I won't
[27:21] decide which to play I just sit in the
[27:23] machine and play and and this was the
[27:25] life service the prophet preached and it
[27:27] tells a lot about the communion all
[27:30] right and it tells a lot about those
[27:33] that are qualified to take communion all
[27:36] right so you listen to him as he
[27:39] explains it to you but then there's a
[27:41] lot said now this will be further into
[27:43] the message that I'm going to be trying
[27:46] to bring on
[27:48] predestination all right and then we
[27:50] will be bringing in trying to see that
[27:52] our thoughts line up with what he says
[27:57] now some of the things he said on this
[27:59] says on this message they're pretty hard
[28:01] to understand and it's going to take a
[28:03] while maybe to you know get in the right
[28:06] attitude and the right things about it
[28:08] and we we you know to the people on the
[28:11] internet maybe some people out there are
[28:13] click on that uh today that uh maybe
[28:16] he's never heard brother brandom you
[28:18] know and maybe they've never do it it
[28:20] but it's wonderful that brother Joe and
[28:22] brother Richard and them came up and
[28:24] fixed it and it's through the life
[28:26] system that we purchase from uh voice of
[28:30] God Recordings to help us you know to do
[28:33] and that way we can play the tape and
[28:35] actually read it on the screen and it'll
[28:37] scroll right on and do and you can read
[28:40] and follow along and read with the
[28:41] prophet it's not very long so we just
[28:44] decided to do it this afternoon and to
[28:47] have the ordination and everything else
[28:49] and you you tell brother Bob that you'll
[28:51] back him up amen you pray for him you
[28:53] pray for these deacons cuz they got
[28:55] their job to do you know so you pray for
[28:58] him and pray the Lord would help them
[28:59] all right so let's just go ahead if you
[29:01] want to let's pray and then we'll be
[29:04] seated and then brother Joe and him
[29:06] Brother Richard and him can get
[29:08] everything to go into where we can can
[29:10] view the whole thing and and listen to
[29:12] it all right father we thank you we love
[29:14] you we ask you now that you would just
[29:16] be with us as we listen to the prophet
[29:19] that he's speaking and may we see the
[29:21] qualifications of what it is to be able
[29:23] to take the communion and Lord and then
[29:26] maybe we can see where we are in you and
[29:28] we thank you for the ability that man
[29:31] has made that we were able to receive
[29:34] these messages and all and we pray you
[29:36] would just bless us now as we read and
[29:39] and listen to your prophet in Jesus name
[29:44] amen you may be
[29:56] seated
[30:35] per gave us this thing from the word of
[30:37] God how true it is that we limit God and
[30:40] time God and he Eternal we can't do that
[30:44] so tonight we're facing something else
[30:47] now is a
[30:50] communion 3 years I waited for a church
[30:53] to come in two son but it's here
[30:57] we're we're here so we thank the Lord he
[31:00] just let us wait you we can appreciate
[31:02] it now I one thing that I want to say
[31:06] just before we start the communion is
[31:09] this that I believe that we have seen
[31:12] enough in our day that we live in that
[31:16] we ought to really give every all of our
[31:20] being to God we we should really serve
[31:24] God I believe that he has blessed us
[31:27] with the direct uh answer to scripture
[31:31] as brother Perry gave it a few moments
[31:33] ago that we we are we're at that time
[31:37] we're not blind we we we see that we're
[31:40] here we we've arrived and we also can
[31:44] look around and see that the way that
[31:46] the human mind is leading the people
[31:50] that we we can't stay too much longer
[31:51] we'd been in a complete insane
[31:54] institution the whole world would be see
[31:56] so we we're at the end time now as
[31:59] brother Perry ended up there seeing
[32:02] these things are true see that they are
[32:05] true they're not myth they're not just
[32:07] something that we imagine there's
[32:09] something that's been directly given to
[32:12] us by the word of God and manifested
[32:15] publicly before us that we know we are
[32:19] here we we don't know how long now
[32:22] because again we come back to a watch
[32:24] you see what time it is but we we know
[32:27] we we here we at the time whether God's
[32:30] time I'd imagine someone give a little
[32:32] analysis one time that said that if God
[32:35] put up with him U according if he was a
[32:39] lot time one 1,000 years is just one day
[32:43] so if a man lived 70 years old it just
[32:46] be a few minutes of God's
[32:48] time well it said to be 40 years that
[32:51] would even meantime hard could bad di
[32:54] see just that's how quick it is the
[32:56] whole whole thing is if it be L time
[32:59] which he doesn't have any time so he
[33:01] just Eternal I believe it was Sarah back
[33:04] know Joseph the other night said to me
[33:06] brother Perry said daddy where when did
[33:10] God come on the scene where did he come
[33:12] from see he had to have a beginning
[33:15] didn't he didn't he have to start I said
[33:16] no anything that has a beginning has an
[33:19] end right but it's that which had not a
[33:21] beginning has no end of course he's 10
[33:24] years old that was kind of a real
[33:25] mouthful for him
[33:27] that how could he receive that knowing
[33:29] that something never did begin not only
[33:32] to him it is to
[33:33] me see it's a great big dose for me how
[33:38] did it ever begin now we're fixing to
[33:41] observe something here that's really
[33:44] sacred I was called on a few days ago to
[33:48] some very fine Christian gentleman that
[33:52] U that's never had this and he
[33:56] understood that we taking communion
[33:58] literally they take it what they call
[34:01] spiritual communion and uh which as far
[34:05] as communion I'd say all right because
[34:08] communicate is to talk to see and the
[34:11] brother again the scripture said brother
[34:12] B don't you think now reason I'm saying
[34:15] this is
[34:16] sorry that reason I'm saying this so
[34:19] that you would understand what you're
[34:21] doing you don't if you're walking in Ain
[34:23] blindly you don't know what you're doing
[34:25] you can't have even in if you don't know
[34:28] what you're doing but you must
[34:31] understand what you are doing and why
[34:34] you're doing it he said now if we take
[34:37] the word of God isn't that God that
[34:41] we're taking I said exactly right sir
[34:44] it's true but we read here that they
[34:46] actually Paul taught taking the literal
[34:50] Lord's Supper this do in remembrance of
[34:53] me said Jesus as often as you take it in
[34:55] remembrance of me you show forth the
[34:57] Lord's death till he come now we are to
[35:00] take it we understand that St Paul who
[35:03] ordained in the church being the prophet
[35:05] of the New Testament Peter James John
[35:09] all of them they wrote Matthew Mark Luke
[35:11] what Jesus did as scribes but Paul set
[35:14] the thing in order he was
[35:16] a he was the prophet of the New
[35:20] Testament just as Moses went into the
[35:22] Wilderness to receive the inspiration to
[35:24] write the the five books of uh of the
[35:28] first five books of the Bible Well Paul
[35:31] also went into the desert and received
[35:34] inspiration from God to set the New
[35:37] Testament Church in order and TI it with
[35:39] the old under there they had a
[35:41] sacrificial lamb and Israel kept that
[35:45] for a memorial it was actually used one
[35:48] time coming out of Egypt but then they
[35:52] kept that as a memorial all down to the
[35:54] age well the law being a shadow of
[35:57] things to come you see now I do believe
[36:01] that communion or what we call communion
[36:03] now is the is the Lord's supper now we
[36:07] only have three physical Divine orders
[36:11] left to us one of them is is
[36:15] communion feet washing water
[36:18] baptism that's the only three things
[36:20] that's the Perfection of the three
[36:22] that's the only three orders we have we
[36:24] realize that that was the issue given by
[36:27] St Paul in the New Testament now if we
[36:30] would say the communion should just be
[36:33] taken the word I don't believe anyone
[36:36] has a right to take the Lord's Supper
[36:38] until he's taken the the word of the
[36:40] Lord into his heart see because I'm I'll
[36:43] read something for you in a few moments
[36:45] and you'll see now notice then why then
[36:50] we we we would on the same basis we
[36:53] could absolutely justify the Salvation
[36:55] Army they do not believe in any form of
[36:58] water baptism that we don't need
[37:01] it now if we don't need water baptism
[37:04] why are we baptized so well water can't
[37:06] save you the blood saves you I'll agree
[37:08] with that amen that's right the blood
[37:10] saves you not the water but we must take
[37:12] the water as an outward emotion that a
[37:15] inward work of Grace has been
[37:18] done so must we own
[37:20] communion when we have taken the Lord
[37:23] our sacrifice into us as a matter of
[37:27] spiritual birth into us and his body we
[37:31] live by him by the word we also should
[37:34] symbolize it because it's a commandment
[37:36] repent every one of you and be baptized
[37:38] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[37:41] remission of your sins Paul said I have
[37:43] received of the Lord that which I also
[37:45] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[37:47] the same night which he betrayed took
[37:49] bread and break it and gave it to the
[37:50] disciples and and said Take and Eat This
[37:53] do uh in remembrance of me for as often
[37:55] as you take this bread you show forth
[37:57] his death till he comes now we find out
[38:00] that in that they had people who come
[38:03] and this precious brother very dear
[38:06] brother he came and he said I never I
[38:08] never did take it brother BR I don't
[38:10] understand what it is I've been taught
[38:11] the other side I said but remember we
[38:14] will admit that St Paul set it in order
[38:17] in the early Christian Church they went
[38:21] from church from house to house broke
[38:22] the bread single to the heart and so
[38:24] forth now I said he did put it in the
[38:27] church Galatians 1:8 he said if an angel
[38:29] from heaven comes and says anything else
[38:32] let it be a curse see amen the same one
[38:35] happens to be rebap tized again from the
[38:38] uh baptism of John to be baptized in the
[38:41] name of Jesus Christ you see there are
[38:43] three things that we must three things
[38:45] that we must do as symbol Lord supper de
[38:49] portion water baptism see there's he
[38:52] said well the now the uh Salvation Army
[38:55] takes it from the point of dying Thief
[38:57] when he died he wasn't baptized yet
[38:59] Jesus said he'd be in heaven that's
[39:02] exactly the truth that's exactly but you
[39:04] see he he he only recognized Jesus right
[39:07] there in the hour he was dying see
[39:10] that's only that's the only opportunity
[39:11] he had he's a Thief His a away he's out
[39:14] and he as soon as he seen that life he
[39:16] recognized it Lord remember me and Jesus
[39:20] that was true but to you and I who know
[39:23] that we should B be baptized and refuse
[39:25] to do it then that'll be between you and
[39:27] God Amen same thing in communion now
[39:31] when we take this communion it isn't
[39:33] just the things that have come up here
[39:34] go to eat some bread and I believe I'm a
[39:37] Christian but if you notice the Bible
[39:39] said he that eateth and drinketh
[39:41] unworthily shall be guilty of the blood
[39:45] and the body of the
[39:46] Lord you've got to live a life that that
[39:51] before the people that and before God
[39:53] and the people that shows that you are
[39:56] you are sincere just a moment
[40:00] longer now in the Old Testament when the
[40:05] sacrifice was made a statue or an
[40:10] ordinance and so is water baptism an
[40:14] ordinance so is feet woring an ordinance
[40:17] amen so is the Lord's Supper an
[40:20] ordinance amen blessed is he does all of
[40:22] his ordinance keeps all of his statutes
[40:24] all of his Commandments that he might
[40:26] have have a right to enter into the tree
[40:28] of life now notice in this now that in
[40:31] that first when it was first an
[40:34] ordinance of God to bring a sacrifice to
[40:36] the church and to the temple and the
[40:39] Altar and offer your gift and uh for
[40:42] your sins the sacrifice of a lamb or I
[40:45] can just imagine seeing some Jewish
[40:48] brother coming down the road knowing he
[40:50] was guilty and he goes to the altar
[40:53] brings his fat Ox a book or or whatever
[40:56] he had a ram lamb something he brought
[41:00] it down the road just as sincere as he
[41:03] could come he walked up there keeping
[41:07] God's ordinance just as sincerely as he
[41:09] could then he laid his hands up on it
[41:12] confessing his sins the priest placing
[41:15] this his sins upon the lamb and the
[41:17] Lamb's throat was cut and U and then
[41:20] died for him he laid there the little
[41:23] lamb kicking and bleeding his hands been
[41:26] full of blood and flying all over him
[41:28] the little lamb blatant dying he would
[41:31] realize that he had sinned and something
[41:34] had to die in his place therefore he was
[41:38] offering this Lamb's death for his death
[41:42] the lamb died in his place then a man
[41:45] done it with sincerity with deepness of
[41:49] his heart finally over and over it went
[41:52] again over and over it kept going until
[41:55] finally
[41:57] it become a
[41:59] tradition the Commandment of God became
[42:02] a tradition to the people and then you
[42:05] come out well let's see this a sword
[42:07] maybe I better go yeah I better offer he
[42:11] went out well Lord here's my B see
[42:13] there's no sincerity in it there's no
[42:17] understanding to it now we don't want to
[42:19] take communion like that that's the same
[42:21] thing as to come to the Lord's table I
[42:25] say uh 35 no I beg your pardon Isaiah
[42:29] 6 let me take that back I I I believe
[42:32] it's Isaiah 28 is where we find this I'm
[42:36] pretty sure that's the right chapter he
[42:38] said precept must be upon precept and
[42:41] line upon line upon line here a little
[42:43] there little hold fast in that what's
[42:45] good for stammer lips other tongues will
[42:47] I speak to this people and this is the
[42:49] rest he said all the tables of the Lord
[42:51] has become full of
[42:53] vomit who can I teach doct who can I
[42:57] make understand see I think that was the
[43:00] right scripture isah TW who can I make
[43:03] understand Doctrine see the tables now
[43:05] we find out today that this great thing
[43:08] that we're fixing to do tonight in
[43:10] commemoration of his death and his body
[43:14] that we believe that we eat daily or
[43:17] just got through eating as our brother
[43:19] preached to us taking the word of God we
[43:21] believe it with all of our heart we see
[43:23] it manifested we see it given us we see
[43:26] it Vindicated we feel it in our lives
[43:29] and we must come to this with a deep
[43:31] conscience of what we're doing not just
[43:34] because it's an order you go into church
[43:36] and many times they get out an old so
[43:39] cracker or some kind of a something
[43:41] bring it up and light bread or something
[43:44] and and break it up and people who smoke
[43:47] drink everything else because they're a
[43:48] member of the church they come and take
[43:51] the Lord's Supper well that's
[43:54] healthiness before God even the
[43:56] sacrifice that your holy days and your
[43:58] sacrifice become a stanum my no yet he
[44:02] ordained them to make that sacrifice but
[44:05] the way they treated it it become a
[44:08] stun stink in his nose his nostril the
[44:12] very sacrifice that he ordained that's
[44:15] right that's the way we take the word of
[44:17] God too many Christians today so call
[44:20] does that we stand up here and teach
[44:22] this word and say Jesus Christ is the
[44:24] same yesterday today and forever
[44:26] and teach the things that he promised us
[44:29] that he would
[44:30] honor and say was for something else our
[44:34] Sodom worships it become a stink in his
[44:37] nose he will not receive it by no means
[44:40] that's Reason by our traditional habits
[44:43] you don't take the Lord's Supper by
[44:46] tradition you take it because it's the
[44:48] love of God in your heart you're keeping
[44:50] the Commandments of God see that's what
[44:52] you take it for so if you don't take it
[44:55] in s
[44:56] just it's a tradition well our church
[44:58] observes communion once every Sunday or
[45:01] once every month or twice a year and you
[45:04] go up say well it's my time take the
[45:07] communion why it's a stink to God see
[45:11] that's just a
[45:13] tradition even like anything else you
[45:17] you've got to be sincere God wants the
[45:20] depths of your heart you remember the
[45:22] very God that brought you here on Earth
[45:24] is the one you're serving
[45:26] you're doing this because he said so
[45:29] because it's his order then we want to
[45:31] give up with deepness
[45:34] sincerity knowing that by God's grace
[45:38] that we have been saved and we we love
[45:40] him and we he his presence and we we sit
[45:44] uh change our lives our our whole being
[45:47] is
[45:48] changed we we we're different people we
[45:50] don't live like we used to we don't
[45:52] think like we used to like in the book
[45:55] here and um a spot there was talk about
[45:58] the the two books being one The Book of
[46:01] Life The First Book of Life coming up
[46:03] was one you were born that was your
[46:05] natural
[46:07] birth but then one time way back down in
[46:10] there there was a little grain of life
[46:12] as I was explained to some of the young
[46:14] sisters at the house this afternoon see
[46:17] there's a little grain of life in there
[46:18] that you'd wonder where did it come from
[46:21] what what these strange things a saying
[46:24] is taken for a like he going to say
[46:27] William Brandon well 40 years ago the
[46:30] William Brandon this is the same one
[46:32] tonight somebody back there say he was a
[46:35] rank
[46:36] Rascal because I was born of Charles and
[46:40] El bran in that nature I was a sinner I
[46:44] came to the world a liar and all the
[46:47] habits of the world laid right in me but
[46:50] down in there je was another nature
[46:54] present
[46:57] predestinated is in there there by God
[47:00] in this same
[47:03] body two Natures in there well I only
[47:07] cater to one is it grow I good as the
[47:09] Baby D ey for thinging or become a liar
[47:13] become everything else that's a sinner
[47:15] because I raised up that way but down in
[47:18] there was a little speck of Life all the
[47:20] time I used to remember as a little
[47:23] boy I hope I'm not holding you too long
[47:26] but going uh sitting out in the on the
[47:29] creek Bank i' sit there and look around
[47:32] at night time Mom they're going on after
[47:35] to their
[47:36] rest and them days they were Sinners
[47:39] there's no Christianity in our homes at
[47:41] all all my drinking and parties and
[47:44] carrying on it made me sick I take my my
[47:48] Rainer and my dog and go up the woods to
[47:51] stay all night in the winter time I'd
[47:53] hunt cuz the party was over maybe
[47:56] daylight in the morning come home with
[47:58] be over i' lay on top of a shed and
[48:00] sleep waiting for daylight to break then
[48:04] i' think of uh how the times then being
[48:07] out there in the summertime get my
[48:11] sticks and put it down for a little wind
[48:13] break or if it rain L I have a pole
[48:16] sticking in the water fishing my old
[48:19] crew dog laying there I said look at
[48:22] here you know last
[48:26] winter I camped right here one night I
[48:29] build a fire right here when I was
[48:30] waiting for my old dog here to tree and
[48:33] uh I had a fire here it was froze 5 in
[48:36] deep in the
[48:38] ground but little fire where did you
[48:41] come
[48:44] from where did you come from Who come
[48:46] out here and planted you and what hot
[48:50] house did they bring you out of or what
[48:52] where'd you come from see that little
[48:55] fire while it was frozen everything and
[48:58] I build a fire on top here besides the
[49:00] freezing element there was a heat
[49:03] element there you're on a big old wild
[49:05] and yet here you are to your
[49:07] Al where' you come from what was it
[49:11] there was another William R okay A
[49:15] little spot of eternal life down there
[49:17] from the the the jeans of God the word
[49:21] of God that was placed in there each one
[49:23] of you can think of similar thing it was
[49:26] working now look up the trees I think
[49:29] Lee I seen you fall off last year and
[49:33] why you back there again where' you come
[49:35] from what brought you here see it was
[49:39] that eternal life working
[49:43] in the
[49:45] body now then one day as I walked on
[49:48] that voice talking don't never smoke
[49:50] drink so forth the young fellas I got
[49:53] older see there was something moving but
[49:56] yet all that once I looked up and I
[50:00] said I'm not the son of Charles and El
[50:04] brand there's something call like no
[50:08] illegal I'm not a chicken there
[50:11] something up y
[50:13] somewhere Jehovah whoever you are open
[50:16] up I want to come home there's something
[50:20] in me calling then I was born again that
[50:24] little life was say there the life of
[50:27] water was poured upon on it and it begin
[50:29] to grow now that old life was forgiven
[50:33] but in the sea of God's forgiveness to
[50:36] Never Be Remembered against me no more
[50:38] amen see now we stand Justified as
[50:41] though we never had sin in the presence
[50:44] of God then when we come to the Lord's
[50:46] table we must come in
[50:48] reverence love and respect of look where
[50:52] we would have been if it hadn't been for
[50:54] him

[51:05] other words just wait a few minutes pray
[51:09] check yourself out and if you know a

[51:13] something that's wrong or something uh
[51:16] and you pray for him too see carry one
[51:20] the other wait just a minute pray
[51:23] there's any feelings between you or
[51:25] something
[51:26] don't don't do don't do it go make that
[51:28] right first see go straighten that up
[51:30] first because you want to come here just
[51:32] as cure as we can be in our thoughts of
[51:36] one another and to God and to each other
[51:40] and then we come in Fellowship around
[51:43] the table of the Lord see and we do this
[51:47] because that we are giving thanks to him
[51:51] and among one another eating of bread
[51:54] between each other drinking the wine
[51:56] between you as his blood and his flesh
[51:59] except you eat the Flesh of the son of
[52:02] man and drink his blood you have no life
[52:05] in you see you see that's what the Bible
[52:09] say except you do it there's no life you
[52:12] see you are then more or less showing
[52:15] you are
[52:17] ashamed to identify yourself as a
[52:21] Christian because of the life that you
[52:24] live and then this is really The
[52:26] Showdown then if you don't do it you
[52:30] have no life if you do do it unworthily
[52:33] you're guilty of the body of the Lord
[52:36] same thing in water baptism if we say we
[52:39] believe on Jesus Christ he saved us from
[52:41] sin and we're baptized in the name of
[52:43] Jesus Christ while we bring we bring
[52:47] disgrace to him we do the things that's
[52:51] wrong and we we have to pay for that and
[52:54] another thing thing when we do that we
[52:57] are trying to profess one thing and do
[53:01] another that's the trouble of us today
[53:03] but I think I'm saying us me and the
[53:07] church that the Lord God has let me
[53:09] speak to in these last
[53:11] hours that we believe we're in the
[53:14] closing time we believe that God has GI
[53:17] us a message amen it's been ordained of
[53:21] God it's been proven of God it's been
[53:23] short of God now we must come to him
[53:27] with
[53:28] reverence and with love and with with
[53:31] purity of heart and mind and
[53:34] soul you know the hour sise when when
[53:38] right Among Us will be the holy spirit
[53:40] will speak out like it did in anth and
[53:42] Sur amen see that hour is arriving am
[53:47] see and we are now you just remember
[53:50] that see the God is going to dwell among
[53:54] his people
[53:55] that's what he wants to do now we can
[53:57] receive the message and saying if I was
[54:01] a young man and hunting for a wife and I
[54:04] could find a wife I said she's just
[54:06] perfect she's a Christian she's a lady
[54:08] she's all this I Got Confidence no
[54:10] matter how much confidence how much I
[54:12] think she's life I've got to receive her
[54:15] she's got to receive me see upon these
[54:18] vows that's the same thing we find is
[54:21] the message we see it's right we see God
[54:24] vindicates it's right is perfectly right
[54:26] year after year year after year
[54:28] continues right continues right
[54:30] everything it says happens just exactly
[54:32] the way he said now we know it's right
[54:34] but see don't do it from an intellectual
[54:37] standpoint if you do you got a
[54:40] second-handed
[54:42] religion we don't want a second-handed
[54:45] religion something that somebody else
[54:47] has experienced and we are living off of
[54:50] of their testimony as I believe it was
[54:53] Jesus said to Pilot
[54:55] uh uh something a word I was thinking he
[54:58] said there just a few moments ago uh who
[55:01] told you that or was it revealed to you
[55:03] how did you know these things in other
[55:05] words I don't know what the word is now
[55:08] it's been a long time since read but how
[55:09] did you how did you know this how who
[55:12] reveal this to you about him being the
[55:14] Son of God who reveal it to you did some
[55:16] man tell you that or as Jesus said is it
[55:21] my Father in Heaven which has revealed
[55:23] it to you see
[55:25] how did you learn it a second hand or is
[55:28] it a perfect Revelation from God is this
[55:32] communion just something I go up for an
[55:34] order say well the rest of take yes I
[55:36] will to it's a
[55:39] revelation that I have part of him and
[55:41] I'm part of you and I love you and I
[55:44] love him and we're taking this together
[55:47] as a symbol of of our love to God and
[55:50] our love and fellowship to one another
[55:54] now I I want to read some from the
[55:56] scripture and then I guess whichever way
[56:00] brother Perry desires today I wish You'
[56:02] read it with me if you got your Bible
[56:04] First Corinthians the U the 11th chapter
[56:07] and begin with the 23rd
[56:10] verse and then also at our Tabernacle
[56:14] we've always observed this and feet
[56:17] washing always because they go hand in
[56:20] hand together I believe the brother
[56:21] announced it Wednesday night because of
[56:23] the crowds and you don't have enough to
[56:25] uh room to get the people in for feet
[56:27] washing go obser observe this Wednesday
[56:29] night now 23rd verse of the 11th chapter
[56:33] of First Corinthians listen to Paul now
[56:36] now remember keep this in mind Galatians
[56:39] 1:8 if we are an angel from heaven
[56:42] preaches any other gospel unto you than
[56:46] this gospel that he preached let him be
[56:48] con
[56:50] curse for I have received of the Lord
[56:53] that which I also delivered unto you
[56:56] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[56:58] which he was betrayed took
[57:00] bread and when you gave thanks he break
[57:03] it said Take and Eat This is my body
[57:06] which is broken for you this do in
[57:09] remembrance of me now let me stop right
[57:12] here to say but taking the body of the
[57:16] Lord Jesus Christ in this communion does
[57:19] not mean that that
[57:21] communion is the literal Body of Christ
[57:24] that's Catholic right I do not believe
[57:28] and that's right I believe it's only an
[57:31] ordinance that God made with that's
[57:32] right it isn't an actual body it's not
[57:36] it's really a little piece of kosher
[57:38] bread that's right it's just an
[57:41] ordinance neither do I believe that the
[57:44] baptism of Jesus Christ in the name of
[57:46] Jesus Christ and water does forgive your
[57:50] sins I do not believe that I believe you
[57:53] can be baptized all day long now I know
[57:56] that there's perhaps people sitting here
[57:58] who come from the apostolic church I
[58:00] mean the United Pentecostal Church which
[58:03] they teach that but you see I I do not
[58:07] believe that the water forgives sins or
[58:10] if it was than Jesus died in vain see I
[58:14] believe it it's only an ordinance of God
[58:17] see to show that you have been forgiven
[58:20] but to be baptized for regeneration no I
[58:23] I I don't believe I don't believe that
[58:25] water forgives sins NE I believe that
[58:27] this bread and and wine has anything to
[58:30] do with you only keeping an ordinance
[58:32] that God has ordained for us to do see
[58:36] after I be water baptism is the same
[58:38] thing I be it's compelling to us to do
[58:40] it that he done it all for our example
[58:42] and he done this for our example and he
[58:44] washed feet for our
[58:46] example now after the same manner also
[58:50] 25th verse after the same manner also he
[58:54] tooked the cup and when he had sin this
[58:58] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[59:02] this do ye as off as you drink it in
[59:05] remembrance of me for as off remember
[59:09] now for as off as you eat this bread and
[59:13] drink this cup you do sh forth the
[59:16] Lord's death till he comes
[59:20] H until he comes amen amen
[59:25] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[59:28] and drink this cup of the Lord
[59:31] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[59:33] and the blood of the Lord let me stop
[59:35] just a minute the reason he said this
[59:37] you notice in another verse here another
[59:39] chapter that he said I understand when
[59:42] you when you come together you're eating
[59:45] even getting drunk at the Lord's table
[59:48] they missunderstood it you see they just
[59:50] fluted in see just like people are doing
[59:53] today just live any kind of life I can
[59:55] take it see he said you got homes to
[59:57] eatting see but this is an ordinance
[1:00:02] that we should keep see now but let a
[1:00:05] man examine himself and so let him eat
[1:00:08] of the right and drink of the cup for he
[1:00:10] that eateth and drinketh
[1:00:12] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:00:15] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:00:20] body what are you you're a Christian
[1:00:23] amen you live before everybody as a
[1:00:26] Christian and if you take that and don't
[1:00:29] live as a Christian you're not
[1:00:30] Discerning the Lord's body you're put
[1:00:32] the stum Rock in somebody else's way see
[1:00:35] as they see you trying to do that and
[1:00:37] they're not living what you're supposed
[1:00:38] to live see you're not Discerning the
[1:00:40] Lord's body now watch what what the
[1:00:42] curse of it is for this caus many are
[1:00:45] weak and sickly among you and many are
[1:00:48] sleep the right translation that word
[1:00:50] brother per is dead
[1:00:52] right many of
[1:00:55] for if we for if we would judge
[1:00:59] ourselves we should not be judged that's
[1:01:03] right we judge ourselves we will be
[1:01:07] judged but when we are judged we're Chas
[1:01:10] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:01:13] condemned with the world see not any
[1:01:16] attached to the world wherefore my
[1:01:18] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:01:21] carry one for the other see and if any
[1:01:25] man hunger let him eat at home that you
[1:01:29] come not together unto
[1:01:32] condemnation and the rest I will set in
[1:01:34] order when I come see now in other words
[1:01:39] don't just come to take it as a as I
[1:01:42] said a while ago about what the Jews
[1:01:43] their sacrifice they it was wonderful
[1:01:46] it's given by God but it got to a place
[1:01:49] where they didn't do it in sincerity and
[1:01:51] reverence and in order then it become
[1:01:53] just a it become a stench in his nose
[1:01:57] now the same thing is but our coming to
[1:01:59] take the Lord's Supper amen that we must
[1:02:03] come knowing what we are doing just like
[1:02:06] when you go into the water to be
[1:02:07] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:02:10] know what you're doing you're putting on
[1:02:13] to the
[1:02:14] church what God has put in you
[1:02:18] Christ when we take this it shows to the
[1:02:21] church that I believe every word of
[1:02:25] God I believe that he is the bread of
[1:02:28] life that come from God out of Heaven I
[1:02:30] believe every word that he says is the
[1:02:33] truth and I'll live by to the best of my
[1:02:36] knowledge God being my
[1:02:38] judge therefore before my brothers
[1:02:41] before my sisters I I do not swear I do
[1:02:44] not curse I do not do these things
[1:02:46] because I love the Lord and the Lord
[1:02:48] knows that bears me record therefore
[1:02:51] before you I take the partial of his
[1:02:53] body to know that I'm not condemned with
[1:02:55] the world see there you are then it's a
[1:02:58] blessing and remember I could give many
[1:03:01] testimonies on this where I've took that
[1:03:03] and explained it in a sick room that's
[1:03:06] right and seen him heal that's right
[1:03:09] remember when Israel taken the type of
[1:03:13] this they journeyed 40 years in the
[1:03:16] wilderness and their clothes never even
[1:03:17] wore out and they come out without one
[1:03:20] feeble among one among them with two
[1:03:22] million people as type of this or what
[1:03:26] would the antitype do if the body of a
[1:03:29] sacrificial animal did that for them
[1:03:31] what would the body of Jesus Christ
[1:03:34] Emmanuel do for
[1:03:37] us let's St be R when we come let us be
[1:03:41] just as rent as we know how to
[1:03:53] come can you say amen
[1:03:56] amen appreciate
[1:04:03] that appreciate hearing what the prophet
[1:04:05] had to say about the the communion and
[1:04:07] things right so let's just stand
[1:04:09] together he read the scriptures all
[1:04:12] we'll do is just the brothers will bring
[1:04:14] it forth and we will just uh pray over
[1:04:18] the the food and you know the bread and
[1:04:23] and just
[1:04:24] bread and the wine and we'll go right on
[1:04:26] into it but take the heart and go and
[1:04:28] listen to the things you know that is
[1:04:33] there and hear what the prophet had to
[1:04:36] say it's over for
[1:04:39] Overcomers not for somebody just out
[1:04:41] living in the world and just doing all
[1:04:43] kind of things doing so you consider
[1:04:45] your own self the Bible says to examine
[1:04:49] yourself to see whether you're in the
[1:04:51] faith or not to examine your
[1:04:54] yourself and then you know consider that
[1:04:57] for your own self all right let's just
[1:05:00] pray and just have a few moments of
[1:05:02] Silent prayer as it says you know
[1:05:04] praying one for the other before we go
[1:05:06] on into the communion
[1:05:21] service in Jesus name
[1:05:27] the Bible said that he took bread and
[1:05:29] blessed Him Father we thank you for this
[1:05:32] bread it's been made for this one
[1:05:35] purpose this afternoon for us to take it
[1:05:38] as
[1:05:39] a memorial unto you for what you've done
[1:05:42] for us and to show as Israel was leaving
[1:05:45] out of Egypt they took these things and
[1:05:48] here we are Lord rejoicing in you and
[1:05:51] knowing that you've made all things well
[1:05:54] we ask you now that you would just Lord
[1:05:58] come down and sanctify this bread and
[1:06:00] sanctify the partakers that we may all
[1:06:02] be one together in you forgive our sins
[1:06:06] and lead us Lord we know this is not
[1:06:08] your
[1:06:09] body but we know that it represents it
[1:06:12] and like the prophet has said even in
[1:06:13] the explaining of these things he said
[1:06:16] he'd seen people healed Lord we thank
[1:06:19] you for your word sanctify the food and
[1:06:22] the partakers in Jesus name
[1:06:32] you know we always think about Israel
[1:06:35] and their journey and things when they
[1:06:38] were coming out they were getting ready
[1:06:40] to
[1:06:41] leave you
[1:06:43] know we were to be getting ready to
[1:06:45] leave out of here it's getting to be a
[1:06:48] pretty bad time we're not people who uh
[1:06:52] run about you know
[1:06:54] getting wings going up on the hill sit
[1:06:56] down and say the Lord's here no we're
[1:06:59] not of that form those people were
[1:07:01] deceived we're not that we are people of
[1:07:04] the light we know that we keep going and
[1:07:07] we don't know how long it'll be like the
[1:07:10] prophet was saying those things there
[1:07:12] that we're ready is here and that was
[1:07:15] 1965 right what about now how much
[1:07:18] closer are we to the finishing up of all
[1:07:22] things we're not going to just throw up
[1:07:24] our hands and go back home and sit down
[1:07:27] and and just say well you know it's all
[1:07:31] over we don't have no hopes no we keep
[1:07:35] going until the Lord com CU that's what
[1:07:37] he said about the communion do this till
[1:07:38] I come father we thank you for this wine
[1:07:41] that's went through this process and now
[1:07:43] Lord it gets greater each day and we
[1:07:45] thank you for your love and your grace
[1:07:47] unto us we know that this wine is not
[1:07:50] your blood no more than the bread being
[1:07:53] your
[1:07:54] body but it's in representation of Thy
[1:07:58] word being the bread of life and now the
[1:08:01] quickening of the wine Lord is to
[1:08:04] stimulation of Revelation into our
[1:08:06] hearts to make that word that we have
[1:08:09] alive in our in our beings because we'll
[1:08:12] eat the little piece of bread we'll
[1:08:13] drink the little bit of wine and Lord
[1:08:16] tomorrow that'll make blood cells in our
[1:08:18] body that we can live thereby so we
[1:08:20] thank you for all things and the truth
[1:08:22] of it we committ it all to you now we
[1:08:24] ask you to sanctify the wine and the
[1:08:26] partakers in Jesus name

[1:13:02] having now put into the heart of Judas
[1:13:03] Hisar Simon son to betray him Jesus
[1:13:07] knowing that the father had given all
[1:13:08] things into his hands that he was come
[1:13:10] from God and went to God he rises from
[1:13:13] supper and laid aside his garments and

[1:13:17] he poured water into a basin and began
[1:13:19] to wash the disciples feet and to wipe
[1:13:21] them with a towel wherewith he was GED
