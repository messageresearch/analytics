TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my [Music] shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we say holy holy amen shining in the light of your glory loving pour out your power in love as we say oh ho [Music] holding your loving Oh Oh I want to see you amen and amen and amen if you can't look around and see him in this day then there's something wrong man good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to Jonah where we've been at 2 and 9 and 10 and we'll go to Genesis 3 remember the announcements and keep up with everything where the the the next announced thing is the Christmas time together here under what the 17th so remember that and just get everything ready for all the things only one service on that day remember that and remember the announcements on through the rest of the year in looking forward to seeing all of these things coming to a close you know and I always look forward to a new year it's not that I try to make a new year's resolution I've never done that because you always just make them anyway and break them then do any good but I always look forward to something new and to me every day is a new day walking with the Lord so I look forward to that don't you amen so let's just pray go right on into this scriptures and the thing father we thank you for your grace and your love and guidance unto us thank you for all things and we just ask you Father to help us and to bless us and keep us in your understanding that our eyes may be opened unto thy word that it would be revealed into each one of our hearts and lives father cuz we know one thing for sure faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word so just got us and let your light shine that we may see you and walk in your love in Jesus name Amen we've been reading this in Genesis in Jonah but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spake and spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land alright let's go over code it's gonna take a little while to come back into this scripture for you to really see the connection but let's read it from Genesis 3 14 and verse 15 and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this dark cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field and upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days with our life here's the main thing go see and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel okay you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now we've been talking about in the Old Testament and talking about salvation alright deliverance the many different things and and the reason that I've chose to use it in the way that we're talking about it I want you to watch something - not very close we can talk about the Covenant that God made with Adam but now what can you say about the covenant with Noah it's going to be surprising in a minute when we come around to a point of trying to drive home something to you because to me it's very valuable to understand the Bible all right now remember this point that we're talking about salvation that it means deliverance you know alright it can have many many things that can be in relation to using the word of deliverance or salvation it doesn't always mean salvation for the Soul you can just mean a deliverance it can mean whatever is needed or a part or a thought for the time that is needed and it's called deliverance or called salvation you remember Moses stand still and see the salvation of the Lord in the Red Sea or the sea opened up you know and they went across and they're clothed back up on the people all right see it's not necessarily a thing of salvation of what we think about of the point of life and eternal life or something like that or whatever now but remember for a certainty they're thought as being all the way through that there was a salvation in the Old Testament right there was a deliverance of salvation in the Old Testament all right and to then it proved that to be true because there was a place for the the people when they died they could go to a place called Paradise and it would show that there was salvation deliverance but remember the point that we've tried to make over and over and I hope this will turn I to kind of drive that down a little to get our thoughts in line that you remember that there's no such thing in the Old Testament as a person receiving eternal life because Jesus Christ had not come and died all right he said well I've heard that and heard that heard that maybe one day it'll don't only that's true because you're still thinking that there is some kind of something that they had back there they could not have eternal life in their soul like that so they have to wait on you and I so Hebrews 11 tells us that the day without us cannot be made perfect all right not meaning they're not saved now not meaning there's not a place farm not meaning there's not a salvation no no way are we talking that but it was for their time in the doing because remember now what our thought will be taken around this point that the natural is a type of the spiritual no see then the Old Testament would be typing the New Testament but remember what you're doing when you're dealing with the top a top is not all the ways exactly to the specific point as your anta type will be right cuz it'll be a type of it it won't be totally in line our broad out exactly it'll type it you know you take a little log and uhyou out a canoe and then you take a big old ship well there's no comparison to what you've got right but it is the thought that it had its beginning or origin into that now remember this and watch our point keep this in mind there is no now watch my point now without watch this go hmmm no there is no form of salvation of eternal life in the Old Testament because Christ had not come yet to release the life that was within him right now but there is no salvation in the New Testament unless the Old Testaments right come on there's no salvation in the New Testament if the Old Testament is not right so we believe in know for sure T how perfect it is that's what I want you to watch tonight something I've studied all week or a few weeks about this message especially because knowing it was coming into view but I want you to think about something to not especially in the covenant with Noah where was there anything talking about salvation and Noah's covenant we're all natural come on do you understand what I'm saying all of that all of half of Adam's was natural all of noise was natural in hi for over hi of Abraham's covenant that we want to talk about unconditional and it's not of the other and think we really understand it's all about natural things but remember now the natural will type the spiritual the natural will type the spiritual our bring out into the open to show you what the spiritual will be so then you can see that truly there was a salvation back there he brought those people to a place and anchored them and gave them a position that they could have life but it would have to wait for a time because it would not be back there in the manifestation at that time so now it's going to require for you to think a little bit tonight and get into your mind what we're talking about and then you'll see the natural types of spiritual you see justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost spoke of back dark coming through the Word of God right now that's that's the point because that's what I want you to see you so what do we need to know we just need to know about justice a way back in Laura what happens to justification what happens is sanctification what happens with the baptism when the Holy Ghost rather than that was very amazed when we wrote out just a little simple point for us here of talking about the new birth into him you could just see that it just it's just you know he'd never thought of it see that the baptism of the holy ghost you can have it every day your life the Prophet said and die and go to hell then we know see that's what I said to us it's things we talk about all the time then we know that the anointing is on your spirit but that was the point I asked the brother or thought I related in relation to him that that that has taken place has to be in the Word of God Jesus planted the word and the word could be made alive darzee Newburg but see we all of our life had it the baptism right what is the new birth some baptism of the Holy Ghost we you know that's right that's right but then it can be wrong according to where the anointing that that's what I say you say do we need to know these things well we're still here for some reason now I'm just gonna be that way with you we're still here 50 something years after the going of the Prophet so there must be some reason we'll all of these hoop laws and and things that they've come up with the new doctrines and ideas and all of these silk you know that was it when we heard that work we're him the great doctor and what Ham had relationship with with even had Cana was that the way it come out or something Noah's why uh yeah that ham had a relationship with his own mother in the brought forth Cana boy would just I mean it's just a for real just you know go ahead yeah give me a piece of ice and I can bring you a 302 you know right not making no joke telling the truth all right now let's get to the thought so then if we can see justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost in the covenants that was made God remember there were three covenants made right remember that the prophet of God said it own the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 1962 it's recoving this one with Adam one wouldn't know well and one with Abraham all right now so if you're going to come to the new birth you're gonna have to come through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost through the Covenant of Adam the covenant of Noah and the covenant of abraham and it's so amazing that is right in the world if you just read and think about it but read it as I said very carefully remember there was two covenants made on condition that was with Adam and Noah would I ask you again would you mind in some way relating to me the covenant with Noah didn't get a little bit with Adam but what about Noah uh-huh he didn't think about it think about what I'm trying to get out we say we know all about this but we can't put it in the word well then I thought if we couldn't put it in word I didn't think we're supposed to have very much to do with it you know I mean all right now think about it Adam's covenant was made and what was the covenant now we've been through this we had to take a little bit with Adam to background to understand what was the covenant with Adam well what's the covenant with Adam you don't partake of the tree of knowledge of good and evil that's all you can read it's not a covenant like a covenant that something is written out that Adam signed and agreed with so we look at it as those type of things and and that's why we're not understanding the Bible Adams covenant was own condition you remember what we brought out his own condition because it was placed too than a free moral agency allowing a person to make a choice and when they made the choice the choice went wrong and that was the only conditions you find you don't find any conditions written to Adam show me the conditions show me something Adam wasn't supposed to do or was supposed what he was to do or what he wasn't supposed to do there's only one thought he wasn't supposed to take that's great now that was where I hope you caught the point what I'm talking about that even till today from that day to where we are today that point our covenant if you want to call it then he made with Adam is still here today because we're still eating of the tree of knowledge and we're still dying the reason we're dying is we're eating of that tree but brother Dale I've got eaten to that tree and we should go back and listen to the messages to save me the time to have to preach do you say but he made a covenant with Adam what was the Covenant just don't eat and do you realize when Adam had now we've been through this right according to blasphemous names your prophet explains that Adam God breathed in this to his nostrils eternal life well I don't know where I believe it or not you just took a bite out for the wrong tree do you understand what I'm trying to illustrate like you and that dog you just took a bite off the tree and you died because you're denying the Prophet and you died that's what we're still Dinah don't know it cuz we're still eating a lot of we don't know the true what it is to take one word contrary to God's Word is the tree of knowledge of good and evil but look what started with Adam now let's get to thought his soul is eternal his body was not it was a creation all right we know his spirit was an eternal okay then we know that what he done was he lost the right to the Tree of Life wage getting the new CEOs bringing out the folks you know so listen very carefully so when Adam / took of the tree of knowledge of good and evil he died and he didn't die physically he'll probably another several hundred years I don't know exactly what the number of years are related to that right and we know he didn't die in his soul because his soul was eternal okay but he lost the prophet said what the right to the Tree of Life the earth and all the physical things you look at Adam as he was there in the garden your prophet said and we know Adams body was in eternal because your prophet was saying what he said the tree of life was in the garden to remind Adam that his youth was being renewed you realize what would happen at Adams stayed in that condition they would have never been no old age that had never been no problems that had never been no troubles right if he stayed in that condition he had eternal life in his soul and his body was just everyday being renewed that's what your profits aDNA but when he lost that right to the tree the book went back his way to be getting to that book was not a king james version or Scofield or Thompson chain or it was the names of the redeemable are they regained let's put it that way coded by stands better all right now but listen to what I'm getting at so in Adam lost the claim Brett around said on the earth now are you listening do you know that when this earth was created your body was in this earth am i right I don't think we call for Mars or Venus you know you know I thought it I thought it was from year am i right now I'm just trying to break it simple so what happened when Adam ate of that tree of knowledge he walked away from the Tree of Life and went with the tree of knowledge he brought death upon all mankind are you with me he died himself physically physically separate over years later he died he died huh and everybody sent sins died the only one of that is Jesus Christ we're gonna wait a long time to get back to him bringing alright but now think about it Adam lost the right of the earth by losing the right of the earth and I just I've wrote this thing three times to try to explain it I'll just forget it and just talk to you Adam lost the right of this earth coming to a full redemption come on seals now it's so hard to stay away from that point because what did brethren talk about in the seals a redemption of all things your body was in the earth waiting to be brought forth but that didn't happen but did it stop the process your body finally came I don't believe you're living in a body today that you wouldn't lived in and did not benefit I kind of believe everything's in relation to that I think you know I don't think I'd have been eight foot tall and you know you know and everything else I I think it's all kind of like it is you know all right but listen to the point Adam don't eat of that tree then you'll remain in a beautiful perfect condition but he didn't so he broke the Covenant remember that covenant now I've emphasized that over and over and over that covenant with Adam is still right here today and we keep eatin of that tree of knowledge which is our own ideas and thoughts of God's Word contrary to his word being true we're still dying and we'll keep on dying until somebody comes to the basis that they can stand on the word by itself while we've been here 50 something years because we've took her own ideas and tried to make our own ways okay now so lock it out in and then hold it right here okay Adam you lost my body go to my body was in that earth okay now watch justification sanctification the baptism with all the ghosts as we go along okay follow her to the line okay maybe that's enough on Adam to hold a point you come to Noah Noah what is your part of Redemption what are you going to type and do what was the Covenant given to Noah what was the Covenant was a contract made a covenant I've got your scriptures laying out here so if you want them just raise your hand and we'll go but you ought to be able to at least go back and read the Bible you can find Noah in Genesis and read a little bit and you'll find out whether or not what I'm saying is true when you come to Noah what was the doozer don't news of Noah if you had to cover their own condition come on did you follow that minute ago what was the do's and don'ts - Adam no do's and don'ts it was just stay away from that tree so what was the do's and don'ts to know what you say brother Dale why do you do the way you do cuz you're just a smart aleck listen folks I may be a smart aleck but I ain't very smart the words are done quit a long time ago and forgot it but I can't what was the covenant with Noah he said no you build an ark there was his covenant you build an ark he said Noah remember it's got to be salvation now he's got to be salvation he's gotta have a deliverer it's form to it right and he said no and I'm quoting brother Branham if you want him he said Noah he said you get in that boat and you said I own that was his words you go get in that boat and you set him what was Noah's covenant what was he to do build an ark what was his don't do you got it it's do you know do's and don'ts you know what I mean a conditional covenant his do's and dont's his do was build an ark he's don't what was it what was he told not to do it was told don't you eat of that tree knowledge because this 2,000 years between Adam and Noah and man had died it's so wonderful my wife asked me the other day why is it that I'm not gonna preach on it I did before a little why is it that between Adam and Noah those people that's where Jesus had to go and preach to them to that group of people there were disobedient in the days of Noah before then why why did it specifically stayed there because there were no prophets there was no prophets he jumped from Adam that's why it's written so fast and it's blunt and iron dumped and forgot it there's no prophets until you come to Noah come on you got to start with Enoch we'll get that guys we got to stop that first because you know what he is but remember he's on the other side of the story there was no prophet Specter he said what does that mean that meant God had to be a judgment somewhere so when he went to hell he didn't go preach to all that were in prison he preached only to those from Adam to Noah to make a judgment to him that they would be condemned now you're back to the story Noah your do is to build the ark your don't is to either the tree of knowledge don't you visualize and see in a world that ISM now is it right the Bible said that it was the data no no it's nothing new Under the Sun what was he is and is that true and and in this world today just like was back then you know that they had a scientific society back tire right and wouldn't it be something you're up on the hillside showing along in the guy comes out he says uh he said how you got to do is just tell me what you want and he said I'll go get you all the material brain tell you and no it just keeps going along taking 120 years all in logs get everything right you're getting the point I hope you listening Noah says that's the tree because God says Noah don't listen to him what's gonna happen what they could build ain't gonna float what they could bill can't float of what's coming said you just build it the way I tell you to build verses do's and don'ts there's is covenant he said this he phone Salling he said when you get it through get all the animals like I told you case you just see the world and making light of him when they could build him anything they wanted to bill I mean that could have building my Titanic's Tim Evans sitting side by side cuz it were a society they were going as to interplanetary travel well I don't know where they're well okay that's one you can argue about but it wouldn't have bothered me I was in a Baptist Church and I remember that it wouldn't have bothered me when they first went to the moon if they'd have found spaceships up there it wouldn't have bothered me because you the Bible said as it was so is it now but you see don't you take none of what they've got you build that art the way I say build it you know what Noah done it was that a Deuce and dogs was that a covenant own condition what was the condition just don't eat of that tree do what I tell you what is justification you're supposed to be remembering that so Noah he builds an ark he gets everything ready he gets in the art and he sets down any weights and God comes forth and great flood comes and all of those things happen all right but when it was finished is really when God made the covenant because when the art and everything was done and it floated and they come back down to earth remember the first thing Noah done offered an offering come from Adam they come down offering offerings right know offered an offering God I'm looking to scripture and God smelled the Lord smelled a sweet savior Genesis 8 and 21 he smelled that sacrifice that was made and he says and I'm paraphrasing right around and he simply says you know I'm sorry that I've destroyed all the world because of mankind and their sin he's not had to destroy it now let's back up to Adam Adam because of what you've done you'll make your living by the sweat of your brow in cursing Eve with all she done and everything put her under the point of a woman never cursed her I'm quoting her to random he said he cursed the earth okay and remember salvation is deliverance okay with Noah can you see what happened God wash the earth he cleansed it of all of the garbage they ain't a thing left all of its down in the holes and underground all in spaceships them big old things they had no down in the earth washed over in the flood and covered oh so far I can't find him he cleanse the earth and he said no more no more will I destroy the earth with water I put a covenant between I listen the covenant was made you said covenant would that wouldn't Noah the Covenant was made with Noah in God yes but you know what the covenant was made from the earth I'm quoting bread around him between God and the earth and he said I won't destroy it no more like that so he said all right start over nor takes up and starts off with all of his doing well I'm because he's delivered the member of the ark was the salvation of Noah are you following me the art was the salvation of Noah the water cleanse the earth read your Bible he said no longer will I do it he said cause my covenant between me and the earth he said no I thought he's coming it was between guarding Adam it was his made both ways I mean Garden Noah it was made both ways it was made between garden Noah that he wouldn't do this that or the other because he delivered knowing by putting him in the ark and brought him out as his salvation right you realize he had done every one of those people back there that wave letter believed it so no the Ark wasn't big enough well we know it wasn't big enough God knew they wasn't gonna do it but they've gotten you one more is gonna do it he'd have made it a foot more Squier right is that simple enough he to put in a few more feet but he knew they would go do it that's his foreknowledge we said Noah come on the ark now your salvation has done this and you're believing me they'll follow me and you're believing me has now placed you as a position taking Adam's covenant you've taken now this covenant and you're walking with it Noah had a covenant he said Noah you and your descendants are gonna be my people don't you see then he justified the earth clean with your body started working on you at that time with Noah in the washing of the world don't eat come into something related to you and me what are you following me Adam loses the earth right are you with me Adam lost the earth Noah redeems Noah it's brought back into a form headed towards total salvation no back in the or dirt or it can be Saint justified cleansed washed off and be used of God he says why I said you can't find things by reading you find things by the Prophet and the way he reads it because there's nothing in relation of Noah's covenant that has anything to do with a form of eternal life I want you to read it to them it's all natural things but remember the natural types the spiritual so he said in motion in the days of Noah is that the way your prophet brought it in future home he justified the world he sanctifies it over with Jesus Christ he justified the world now to prove it I'm going for the home you get over to add a to Abraham now remember Adams covenant was on condition Noah's covenant was on condition Abraham's covenant was unconditional now what does that mean unconditional well they say no conditions you got a wonderful understand him a very little spiritual sense but it's alright he's that hard enough to slap you to make you listen Adam shows you the earth lost Noah shows you the redeeming are the saving are the deliverance of the earth now in the earth you've got the enemy to fight which is your next-door neighbor you've got the people around you you know other nations etc they all want it now what's it show me one thing in Abraham in the natural point of what you read show me one thing that covers any salvation any soul redeeming see they didn't have it back come on I mean I'm open I'm I'm not trying to be sarcastic I'm trying my best to preach my heart out pretty to get you to see brother Branham was a prophet and knew what he was talking about and how he could place it together and make it come out but he'd make it come out according to the Bible read it did it not come to no one he says Noah my covenants with you I brought you through the archive delivered you I've given you salvation to bring you out he said I've cleansed the world and I'm making a way to one day bring your body back out of that earth is not that supposed to be what we're doing now coming up to Abraham and his unconditional covenant we can go through the whole story of the the things that he was showing with the animals and how they were divided and how the Sun was going down and all of the things we'll remember that's only a natural story those things were literally happening to Abram and Abram at the time what was Abraham's unconditional covenant and word of stark you're gonna have to show it to them in Adam first bring it through Noah for me to be able to believe you that you understand that can come to Abraham it's gotta have a natural starting come on Adam you lost the world Noah is going to start the process of a redemptive plan for the world what was the first thing to read your Bible what was the first thing that was promised to Abraham nothing about salvation read it bring it to me just don't jump over to the 15th or 16th and start showing the the points of this you know represents and the birds and all of this that in the other what did he say to Abraham what was the first thing he said did Abraham he didn't say you're my chosen that was later he didn't say this he didn't say that that was later was the first thing he said to a brown or Abram what was the first thing he said I'll give you this land from here to here to here and everything no ain't getting the whole world come on and we ride around the whole world he gave him room here desire named it that's the first part of the Covenant Abraham I'll give you everywhere what I used to love o brother might when we first come in this message he said we didn't we didn't come through Pentecost like the rest of y'all a lot of you know brother Mike he he'd walk around he'd shake at room that old left hand and he'd set that foot down and he'd say said I'll give you every where you put this over your foot well I could just see Abraham walking because that's what happened he started off giving him what portion of the earth that he was going to have for his inheritance he never started talking to him buddy turn a lot number you're typing and I'm running out of time but listen what was the next Abraham Abraham I'm not only gonna give this to you I'm gonna give it to urine seed after you I'm all right first it gives him to land he appears to him as different names in relation he finally gives him and tells him said it's going to be this it's going to be that and said I'm not only going to just give it to you he said I'm gonna give it to your seat after you in other words Abraham look up to the heavens and see the star look he just say end of the season now what wrote around said he said when they say let's see if I can get that quote the sands to the Stars the resurrection it's something that relationship he because he gives him the land he's walking on you know what he was walking on your body no I'm an American born over here glory hallelujah you're smart but stupid spiritually speaking sorry but it's true little run said nothing necessarily the same gases you know you could be as always illustrate a line could grab you over in Africa and won't be down and eat you and they could grab him up real quick and put him on our plane flying to America he gets to America he's and there you come out where do you belong Africa America so the Prophet said not necessarily the same gases but the same elements out of this Abraham as he is walking maybe they'll encourage you to look some of those graphs up that shows you Abraham was walking on your body he said no Widow come on that's about four thousand years ago I don't think you ought to be concerned whether you would hear thy her just get the point the point was he walking on the sand he said that your seed shall be as the sand of the seashore he starts making a promise a promise of redemption of the natural people then in a little bit he says okay you're doing pretty good and he says now hey Abram he said we'll give you a little bit more the Covenant he's come on change your name from Abram Abraham I'm gonna make you the father of Nations because you got to be that you're gonna be their daddy with all this spiritual Kingdom I thought we believed we were the spiritual seed of Abraham by faith I mean we Baptist taught that we're gonna be in well you shouldn't be that way why not we did right around there not to explain Abraham was the father of the faith to me we knew that the Baptist Church so we read the Bible but he says Abraham you got the land you said you got the promise of your seed coming forth and said now just remember when that seed gets here he said you gonna have to take every one of them men you do have circumcised remember Adam Adam if you'd have stayed for that tree Noah just keep staying with that tree you're on the right channel Abraham Abram you're doing right you got the promise of the land you've got the promise of your seed after you now take your children and we'll make another covenant said circumcise them children to make you a different nation from any nation in the world because no nation as a circumcision as a type of shadow what is circumcision atop of the baptism with oligos right a chosen people remember they were chosen out of the land remember they come up out of the earth remember our bodies comes out of the earth remember all of the story that I've tried to tell you it says Abraham just walk around just walk around Abraham and have yourself a good time since because I'm gonna give you every word that had ever come it's under there is gonna be one of your seed they pick up circumcision man drew Noah was brought back to the right of looking at an inheritance of the earth did she follow that through Noah a right to mankind was given to look at to inherit an earth because it was washed and they clean Abraham I'll give you the Land of Israel oh I set NARR today cuz he I don't I don't read I read the funnies in the papers you know I don't read the headlines that much because there's more news in the funnies but you know what I turned over I look today a lot of you procure it with Trump says I'm gonna kill Jerusalem to the Jews for their capital let's see if he gets by with it I pray to God he to us I pray to God that he gives them that Jerusalem as their capital and he says we do we'll put our embassy right there you think what you want to about the man he may be the guy that gets all of this stuff started to because what do you think is gonna happen if he turns around and makes that Jerusalem the capital of Israel oh you gonna have mayhem on the other side you're gonna have death in every corner because Jerusalem was promised to the seed of Abraham so he starts with the land and Abraham and he goes to people to call of his seed he winds up being to the circumcised of people and bringing man back to his country in his land as the top the what started in Jesus Christ Mariah so then justification sanctification baptism when the Holy Ghost has topped in the Old Testament followed to the letter by the reading of the world if you followed what I done I went through Genesis following it to were and what did brother Branham say on who is this Mel charity he said ever seed of the faith and getting it right ever son of the faith will take the same journey and Abraham took you know what Abraham wind up meeting he wound up meeting Almighty God ever born-again believer will meet God and be changed one day because of a covenant that he made with them people he said he'd used to make it with Abraham no he said and I'll make it with his seed after him it's not a Jew that's what you outwardly it's a Jew that's what you Edward Lee a covenant the Covenant had him you lost it Noah is beginning to appear Abraham you're coming back the way it should have been but none of them had eternal life in their soul but they had to promise they had the Covenant now but if I get this wrong you correct me how did he say it he said David said returning to me the joy of thy salvation he said now David never lost his salvation he said he just lost the joint Abraham you're gonna get your covenant made because you never lost your covenant there's never been a Christian entire shatters it ever lost show me one show me one in Tights our shadows even that a true seed did not win the victory a true seed of Abraham will always come out on top what about it come on musicians what about it a covenant but hope you thought of my point not a thing about Adam - talking about right there of eternal life not a thing about Noah and bringing it you got to come to the land you got to get the land right and then the people comes out of the land and the last thing we stopped on or sanctification coming into the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the covenant of circumcision withheld and I will stop here would you remember I invite you to do one thing brother branham's said Israel made the biggest mistake of their life in Exodus 19 when they accepted law for grace I want you to read that I want you to read it and I want you to come and show me where that's at I want you to read it I want to read it to me that they accepted law instead of grace don't come with what they say it because when it was told it was not told the commandments were coming the way it was told the people said everything you say do everything you say will do it reads about everything you say we're gonna do it we're gonna do the tubes and we're gonna do the donors do you see why they thought they got a book of rules they thought they got another covenant with do's and don'ts and Abraham had done pipes that come on them Iraq what do you think about it Mustang just read it read Exodus 19 over and over and over and over and you will see they said Moses you go up and find out what God wants us to do and we'll do every bit of it well don't do the don'ts and we'll do the dues that he says for us to do and God said you're doomed you've accepted law instead of grace we're not through yet why don't we get wings that of number 41 41 the wings of it on the floods in eBay he serves for land in the way what about it do you know what to cut Robles he [Music] where the children are covered God gave him his side on the wings of
