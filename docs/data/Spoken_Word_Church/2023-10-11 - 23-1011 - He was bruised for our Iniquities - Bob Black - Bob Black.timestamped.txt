[7:55] um thank you
[7:57] I I'm just struggling tonight y'all bear
[8:00] with
[8:02] me all right we'll get
[8:04] there so tonight I'm going to read from
[8:07] um 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and just
[8:10] take a little topic of he was bruised
[8:12] for my
[8:14] iniquities and uh as we go to prayer we
[8:17] certainly have a lot to pray for uh
[8:19] we've been watching all the things going
[8:20] on in Israel and uh boy as things come
[8:23] out it's really grieving to see all that
[8:26] they're going through over there so
[8:28] certainly keep them in prayer um
[8:31] somebody sent me a I saw something pop
[8:34] up where somebody they had killed a
[8:36] little mother and father over there that
[8:38] had they were laying on top of their
[8:39] twin babies and um their twins they
[8:41] found them the day later and just all
[8:43] sorts of things like that that just
[8:45] really Grieve Your Heart to see and um I
[8:48] certainly as Believers we uh you know
[8:51] there's just like that special kinship
[8:53] that you know you see the Israelites
[8:55] that are one day there's going to be a
[8:57] selection of them going to they're going
[8:58] to re receive the same message that
[9:00] we're hearing today and certainly
[9:03] there's something within our heart that
[9:04] just reaches out to them and so let's
[9:08] remember them to keep them in our hearts
[9:10] and remember brother Wade as he's up in
[9:12] I guess he's in Illinois and remember us
[9:15] this weekend we'll be traveling to in
[9:17] out that little church outside
[9:18] Indianapolis to minister for them so
[9:20] keep us in your prayers um that we'll
[9:23] just have safe travels and so forth
[9:26] let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God
[9:27] we're so grateful to be able to together
[9:29] around your word tonight Lord Jesus and
[9:31] there's many needs Lord that we're
[9:32] mindful of Lord Jesus even even in this
[9:35] congregation certainly many needs Lord
[9:37] Jesus on our mind constantly are the the
[9:40] ones that we've just mentioned over
[9:41] there in Israel Lord and all the needs
[9:43] here in our little church sister Freda
[9:45] and brother Dale and all the ones that
[9:47] are have needs in their body
[9:49] Lord and we just ask Lord that you'll
[9:51] Lord minister to all the needs tonight
[9:53] Lord Jesus you know the needs of your
[9:55] people Lord God and you Lord set us up
[9:58] that way so that we we'd constantly be
[9:59] needing you Lord Jesus but we've got
[10:01] promises lay there in the word Lord that
[10:03] You' never leave us or forsake us that
[10:05] you always you'd always be with us Lord
[10:07] God that you would always be our comfort
[10:09] and our guide Lord so we're looking to
[10:12] those promises tonight Lord Jesus Lord
[10:15] one one promise that we've got that we
[10:17] were looking at tonight Lord is that you
[10:19] promise that you would forgive us of all
[10:20] our iniquities that you were bruised for
[10:22] that purpose Lord Jesus and as we look
[10:24] into your word I pray God that you'll
[10:26] give us guidance and purpose in our life
[10:28] and understanding Lord Jesus to so that
[10:30] we have so that we are equipped to face
[10:33] the hour that we're living in and to go
[10:35] against the devil no matter what he
[10:37] brings to us Lord we just ask your
[10:39] blessing upon your word now in your name
[10:43] amen now 2 Thessalonians and
[10:48] um I'm I'm going to try to be kind of
[10:50] brief tonight we'll we'll see you know
[10:53] that's kind of dangerous when a minister
[10:54] says that I'm going to be brief and he
[10:57] goes long but we'll see so 2
[10:59] Thessalonians 2: 1-8 says now we beseech
[11:02] you Brethren by the coming of our Lord
[11:05] Jesus Christ and by our gathering
[11:07] together unto him that ye be not soon
[11:09] shaken in mind or be troubled neither by
[11:12] Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from
[11:14] us as that the day of Christ is at hand
[11:17] let no man deceive you by any means for
[11:20] that day shall not come except there
[11:22] come a falling away first and that man
[11:24] of sin be revealed the son of predition
[11:28] now think about those words that he's
[11:29] given unto him that that there's got to
[11:31] be some things happen first so don't be
[11:33] shaken if it takes a while for the
[11:35] things that we're talking to you about
[11:37] come to pass let no man deceive you by
[11:40] any means for that day shall not come
[11:42] except they're coming Falling Away first
[11:44] and certainly we're seeing a lot falling
[11:46] away today uh people all around the
[11:48] message all around the world giving up
[11:50] their faith and saying all the things
[11:52] that they've been preaching for 40 years
[11:53] are are not true but just because they
[11:55] can't find evidence in the library of
[11:58] how how a bridge was built or something
[11:59] like that oh church we got to have a
[12:01] revelation Revelation is what we need
[12:05] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[12:07] of predition who opposeth and exalteth
[12:09] of himself above all that is God or that
[12:11] is worshiped so that he as God sth in
[12:14] the temple of God showing himself that
[12:16] he is God remember you not that when I
[12:20] was yet with you I told you these things
[12:22] and ye now you know what withholdeth
[12:24] that he might be revealed in his time
[12:27] for the mystery of an Equity do already
[12:30] work only he who now leth will let until
[12:33] he be taken out of the way uh isn't that
[12:36] you may be see that the Lord at his
[12:37] Blessing to the reading of the word
[12:38] isn't that interesting the way that Paul
[12:40] speaks he'd say things that like Peter
[12:42] said are hard to be understood that he
[12:44] would say something like that the
[12:45] mystery of iniquity does already work
[12:48] only he who now lth will let until he be
[12:50] taken out of the way what are you
[12:51] talking about Paul I I you know you're
[12:54] thinking about brother Brandon when he
[12:55] preached when he preached that that
[12:57] message the first seal he talked about
[12:58] how that and so many other places he
[13:00] talked about how that that um how that
[13:03] your journey through the gospel is like
[13:06] uh like a man shooting a Target and you
[13:08] know you start you start your journey
[13:10] off and you you you you know you're
[13:12] building one Doctrine on on the other
[13:14] building one Doctrine on the other and
[13:16] you're going somewhere and if you get
[13:18] one little thing off one little thing
[13:21] off that you need to go back and get
[13:23] that right otherwise you'll never get to
[13:25] the finish line now the and the quote
[13:28] that I'm reading from he said we were
[13:30] talking the other day about people who
[13:32] getting off the track it's just like
[13:34] shooting a Target if that gun is
[13:36] perfectly balanced perfectly trained and
[13:39] sighted it's got to hit the target
[13:41] unless that Barrel moves right it's
[13:43] going to hit the target unless there's
[13:46] some external influence unless there's
[13:48] something the w a gust of wind the the
[13:51] barrel moves something happens or he
[13:54] said or twists or vibrations throws it
[13:57] off or wherever or a wind puff wherever
[14:00] it starts off at there's only one way to
[14:03] do is come back to where it left the
[14:05] track and start again if it's going to
[14:08] hit the target if it doesn't why it just
[14:10] doesn't hit the target now I I'm not
[14:13] yall know I'm not a hunter I'm not
[14:16] somebody that goes and shoots bows and
[14:17] arrows but we can certainly look at
[14:19] those examples of somebody that's they
[14:21] pulling that string bow string back and
[14:24] and and and just a little puffle wind
[14:25] will blow that era off and you might be
[14:27] just a little bit off
[14:29] back there when the where the the person
[14:31] with the bow stands but by the time it
[14:33] gets to the Target it's way way off and
[14:36] see that's how we've got to approach the
[14:38] gospel we've got to be we've got to be
[14:39] so careful how we present and how we how
[14:42] we do because I I I think certainly
[14:45] that's really one evidence of the new
[14:47] birth is that promise laying there in
[14:49] the Bible that the spirit of truth will
[14:51] lead and guide you into all truth now
[14:54] you know going through life some some
[14:56] maybe don't have the capacity or the the
[14:58] get kind of off course and they they'll
[15:00] stop before they get to the goal and for
[15:02] those those kind of reasons but if we'll
[15:04] yield ourselves to to the Lord he will
[15:07] take us from the beginning to the end
[15:09] he'll take us to cross that finish line
[15:11] and and and see brother random said
[15:13] that's the way in studying scripture
[15:15] like an Archer standing there shooting
[15:17] at the Target or a a person with a gun
[15:19] shooting at the Target that's the way in
[15:21] studying the scripture I believe you'll
[15:23] never figure it out with your mind it's
[15:27] got to come from God uh I I think maybe
[15:31] if we could just Define what a
[15:32] revelation is tonight you know you've
[15:34] got all these little bits and pieces
[15:35] laying here in the word and you can
[15:37] study out the statute of perfect man and
[15:39] study out adoption and study out Daniel
[15:41] 70 weeks and study out all the
[15:43] components but then the spirit of God
[15:46] will come and put everything together
[15:49] now there's what a revelation is now
[15:51] education you education you say look I'm
[15:53] I'm reading William Shakespeare and I
[15:55] see you read it and you read it and
[15:57] you're like oh that's a good point point
[15:59] now that's education but Revelation is
[16:02] putting things together Revelation is
[16:04] where the picture begins to come
[16:06] together like a puzzle you go to the
[16:08] store and and you you'll get a puzzle
[16:10] with a it's on the box it's got a nice
[16:12] picture of what you're going to put
[16:13] together but you throw out all the
[16:15] pieces on the floor and you don't know
[16:17] where everything goes oh but there's if
[16:19] oh if you had like the author of that
[16:21] puzzle standing next to you and tell you
[16:23] oh that goes over on the right hand
[16:25] corner that goes over on the left then
[16:27] the thing begins to come together and
[16:28] you know where it goes that's why when
[16:31] you look when you read the Bible you've
[16:33] got to have a relationship with God
[16:35] you've got it takes the spirit of God to
[16:37] put together the essence of this puzzle
[16:39] to paint the picture right and just like
[16:42] somebody shooting a Target you if you
[16:44] get off Off the Mark you you got to go
[16:46] back if you want to get to the Finish
[16:47] Line right you got to go back to where
[16:50] you got off off is that interesting that
[16:53] he said somebody like shooting an eror
[16:54] he described it as it it's on a track
[16:57] like a train like a train track and if
[16:59] it gets off the track you go back to
[17:01] where you got you you your your
[17:04] doctrines off and get straightened out
[17:07] if we just make ourselves available to
[17:09] him that's why you know I I I began to
[17:12] meditate on you know it it's really it's
[17:16] you think about when we get up here and
[17:17] preach and and there's a lot that you
[17:19] don't really maybe see we come we come
[17:21] to Wednesday night service and Sunday
[17:23] morning and we we we speak for maybe an
[17:25] hour but you don't see a lot of the
[17:28] effort and the work that goes into that
[17:30] a lot of times it's not really spoken of
[17:32] so much but you know that's really a
[17:33] Minister's gift a gift that the minister
[17:36] has is to study to study and lay in the
[17:39] word and labor and labor and and study
[17:42] these things out so that you can share
[17:44] them with the people because many times
[17:46] you know people you that's not that's
[17:48] not your gift there are many gifts you
[17:50] read Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12
[17:52] about gifts in the church there's Gifts
[17:54] of Mer mercy and Gifts of encouragement
[17:57] and all sorts of gifts that are in the
[17:59] body of Christ but there's a gift the
[18:01] The Minister's gift is to lay in the
[18:03] word and study because maybe maybe a
[18:06] poor little sister that's got a need in
[18:08] her body and she's just you know just
[18:09] sitting there in a home she making some
[18:12] doing some crochet or something cooking
[18:14] some some some some nice biscuits or
[18:16] something in the morning to feed her
[18:17] family but she's not going to have that
[18:19] gift of study oh you think about how God
[18:22] put it together like that so that we
[18:24] would have to come together and see one
[18:27] another during the week and we would
[18:28] have to come together and you'd have to
[18:31] come together and God put it in the
[18:33] church gifts in the church so that
[18:35] there'd be somebody that could study and
[18:37] lay before the Lord and get the will of
[18:39] God so that they could speak the word
[18:42] over the people and that there would be
[18:44] somebody that would they would be
[18:45] predestinated to sit there in the Pew
[18:48] and listen to the word coming forth and
[18:50] say I believe that you see that's what
[18:53] you as a as a minister you you you talk
[18:56] about how we've we've got to we've got
[18:58] we've got to keep the target we've got
[18:59] to keep things focused the right way and
[19:02] that's if that's what a Minister's gift
[19:04] then we are we have got to yield
[19:07] ourselves to study and prayer you know
[19:09] you go back into the into the book of
[19:11] Acts and find out that the reason why
[19:13] deacons were actually put into the
[19:14] church is because the ministers were
[19:17] they wanted to give themselves to study
[19:19] and prayer and that takes a lot of
[19:22] effort when you when you when you're
[19:23] studying I I think really if we were
[19:25] going to put some time to it it probably
[19:27] takes me about 20 30 hours of study to
[19:31] prepare for for one for one little 45
[19:33] minute uh sermon and you'll say I I've
[19:36] heard many people they'll poke and say
[19:37] well you when you get better at it you
[19:39] won't need to study that much and you
[19:41] know used to that used to affect me but
[19:43] listen really really we should study
[19:45] more and more because because that's
[19:48] that's our role and you see you study
[19:50] when you stud when you get to the place
[19:52] where you think well I don't need to
[19:53] study anymore then something begins to
[19:56] something begins to slip and second
[19:58] Timothy Chapter 2 Paul told Timothy
[20:00] Paul's guiding his little his little his
[20:03] little student Timothy there he said of
[20:04] these things put them in remembrance
[20:06] charging them before the Lord that they
[20:08] strive not about words to no profit but
[20:11] to the but to the subverting of the
[20:13] hearers study to show thyself approved
[20:16] unto God a Workman that needeth not be
[20:19] ashamed rightly dividing the word of
[20:21] Truth you got to study to show that
[20:24] you're a Workman that's worthy that
[20:26] you're worthy of your calling study
[20:28] to get in the word and lay in the word
[20:30] so that when you stand behind the pulpit
[20:32] you've got something to say that will
[20:33] help the people you know really a huge
[20:36] responsibility lays in the ministry if
[20:39] if there if the people that are sitting
[20:40] in the congregation don't have the same
[20:42] kind of gift that the minister does to
[20:44] really study and get in the word then it
[20:47] behooves us as ministers that we have to
[20:49] lay in the word because that is our
[20:51] responsibility you read in Ephesians
[20:53] 4:11 and 12 and it says that the
[20:55] ministry is actually given to bring the
[20:57] people the gift of the fivefold ministry
[21:00] to bring the people to the stature of a
[21:02] perfect man so it's up to us to lay in
[21:04] the word and do like they did in the
[21:06] early church give themselves totally to
[21:09] study and prayer study and study and
[21:11] study and prayer I remember when I first
[21:13] started preaching I I I got to to preach
[21:15] at another church and you know sometimes
[21:17] when you go out and preach at other
[21:18] churches the pastors there will they'll
[21:20] say things to kind of nudge you and help
[21:22] you and sometimes when you go up to
[21:23] preach they after you're done they'll
[21:25] say things to kind of correct you even
[21:27] while you're sitting there and and those
[21:28] are things to help us and I remember I
[21:30] remember kind of complaining to the
[21:32] pastor I I was quoting Solomon much
[21:35] study is a weariness to the flesh
[21:37] because in that instant I had felt like
[21:39] IID studied until I was just I could I I
[21:41] studied until I couldn't hardly I was so
[21:43] weak I had lost sleep I I I I'd studied
[21:46] and studied and and I thought I'd get
[21:47] some maybe some Grace from this minute
[21:49] from this pastor and he gave me no Grace
[21:52] he he pretty much told me well that's
[21:54] what you're supposed to be doing because
[21:55] that's you want to be able to preach
[21:57] something
[21:58] I I I think that's our that's our
[22:00] example the example for of a minister
[22:02] should be is you got to do everything
[22:04] you can to bring the gospel to the
[22:06] people cuz that's what you that's what
[22:08] you're there for to lay in the word and
[22:11] pray unceasing and when we we get to get
[22:14] lazy that oh you see what brother Ram
[22:15] said and God keeps his word he said what
[22:18] started any cult it was hungry children
[22:21] trying to find something to eat oh you
[22:23] think about there's people all around
[22:25] the world there's people in South
[22:26] America and all around the world that
[22:28] just wants something to eat and the the
[22:30] field is ripe all they need is somebody
[22:33] to go preach the gospel if somebody will
[22:35] catch the vision and go step out and
[22:37] preach and stop being lazy and do what
[22:40] God called him to do brother R said if
[22:43] you lazy bunch of preachers won't give
[22:45] them the gospel they'll eat out of a
[22:48] garbage can that's right I lay it on to
[22:50] you preachers that's right if you won't
[22:52] give the children the bread of life
[22:53] they'll take some kind of a scum out of
[22:56] a garbage can and eat it
[22:58] and oh oh certainly if you go out and
[23:00] preach anywhere you can see you can see
[23:03] the effect that I'm I'm not trying to be
[23:05] critical but lazy preachers laziness
[23:08] that won't study that won't study the
[23:10] word oh so how grateful should you be
[23:13] tonight if you're sitting in a church
[23:15] that's got preachers that will study and
[23:18] lay before God and study and study and
[23:21] study because Believers want the word
[23:24] Believers want to be fed and Eagles got
[23:27] to have eal food a Believer wants what
[23:30] is in this book this book that we've
[23:32] been talking about that was in the hand
[23:33] of God this book that we want we want
[23:36] revelation of what it means and if
[23:38] somebody can lay before God and study it
[23:41] out until they can preach it and preach
[23:43] it not so it not not like some some
[23:46] boring thing where we're white boring it
[23:48] but actually preach it until we know
[23:50] it's so good until we can run the house
[23:52] and preach it that's what God is calling
[23:55] us to do because we're searching what
[23:57] why do we want what's in that book
[23:59] because we're searching for a way back
[24:02] we're searching for a way back to what
[24:04] Adam lost and the way back is by the
[24:08] word and that's why something within any
[24:10] believer is craving for the
[24:15] word the other night when we were
[24:18] preaching on just to background just a
[24:19] little bit more Adam Forfeit of the book
[24:22] of life for the knowledge of Satan and
[24:26] lost his inheritance lost lost
[24:28] everything and no way for
[24:31] Redemption no way for Redemption that's
[24:33] what was in that book that's that's the
[24:36] importance of that book now the book
[24:37] we're talking about you take Christ is
[24:40] the word he is that book you take Christ
[24:43] the word and put him in letter form so
[24:45] that you could read about him and now
[24:46] you've got that book that Bible laying
[24:48] there in your hands and then if you take
[24:51] that same Christ and put him in your
[24:53] heart so that you can take the page the
[24:55] word and letter form off the page then
[24:58] it brings forth the essence of what's
[25:00] written and puts the puzzle together
[25:03] Adam had completely Supreme control of
[25:06] the earth he was a god of the earth
[25:08] God's the god of the universe everywhere
[25:10] but his son had this Earth under his own
[25:12] control he could speak he could name he
[25:15] could say he could stop nature he could
[25:16] do anything he wanted to see but when he
[25:18] did that he lost his inheritance oh you
[25:21] see why that's the book is so important
[25:24] to a Believer the word the word that's
[25:26] laying here in the pages of this book is
[25:29] so important to a Believer because oh
[25:32] you begin to eat this book and it slowly
[25:34] will take you back it's taking you back
[25:36] to what Adam lost it's restoring to you
[25:39] everything that Adam lost then God made
[25:42] in the likeness of man I'm just reading
[25:44] some things that brother Ram said came
[25:46] down and become a redeemer to us to
[25:48] redeem us and now we find out that in
[25:51] days past by these things which was
[25:53] mysterious is to be opened up to us in
[25:56] the last days why is it going to be open
[25:57] up in the last days because God's going
[26:00] to show you he's going to show you the
[26:02] whole Plan of Redemption to give you
[26:05] rapturing faith rapturing faith to know
[26:07] to see how your Redemption works to see
[26:09] what happened in your Plan of Redemption
[26:11] to see what how God is going to redeem
[26:13] the Earth to see the same way that he
[26:15] redeems you and redeems the Earth he
[26:16] redeemed the 144,000 and you see all the
[26:19] puzzle is being put together brother
[26:22] said a tree never died before Adam an
[26:25] animal life an animal Wouldn't Die for
[26:27] Adam and there's only one thing that
[26:30] cannot die and that's God because he's
[26:32] Eternal and that's the only way we can
[26:34] ever keep from dying we have to have
[26:36] eternal life in us to be Sons and
[26:37] Daughters of God but when we died to sin
[26:40] we sold out our Birthright and crossed
[26:42] this Chasm now we're beyond the reach on
[26:46] this other side of the chasm and in
[26:48] Revelation 5:2 it says I I saw a strong
[26:52] angel proclaiming with a loud voice who
[26:55] is worthy to open the book and to loose
[26:57] the the seals thereof now as we were
[26:59] preaching last time H who is worthy
[27:01] there is nobody but how how's that book
[27:03] going to be open not by our own works
[27:05] not by our own devices not by you you're
[27:08] not going to be able to make that era
[27:09] Hit The Target just by willing it to but
[27:12] it's going to take God to do it God to
[27:14] put the puzzle
[27:17] together he said as soon as John heard
[27:19] this announcement for the kinsman
[27:21] redeemer to come forth and to make his
[27:22] claims there was no man that could do it
[27:25] no man in heaven no man in earth no man
[27:28] beneath the Earth and no one was worthy
[27:30] even to look at the book just think of
[27:32] that no person at all worthy even look
[27:36] at it and John just started
[27:39] weeping now I I I like to repeat things
[27:43] because I think it helps us but look why
[27:45] why was he weeping you you got the whole
[27:47] book of redemption laying there what
[27:49] what if that book couldn't be open that
[27:51] all these people that that were all the
[27:53] ones that were born again on the day of
[27:55] Pentecost are now in the grave they're
[27:57] never coming coming up if that book
[27:58] couldn't be open that the the dead
[28:00] Saints are never going to rise from the
[28:02] grave the pollution of this Earth is
[28:04] just going to go on and on the the the
[28:06] mess of oh you think about over there in
[28:08] in in Israel what's going on the
[28:10] Israelites attack attack the
[28:12] Palestinians they attack Hamas then
[28:14] Hamas gets upset because they kill their
[28:16] children they attack them back and they
[28:18] go back gets upset because they kill
[28:20] their children they attack them back and
[28:21] they go back and forth and back and
[28:23] forth and it'll never get resolved if
[28:25] that book hadn't open you just go back
[28:27] and fourth with that's that's what all
[28:29] that's the the best that Satan has to
[28:30] offer is a lot of people getting upset
[28:32] with one
[28:33] another oh that's why God has called us
[28:36] to love and not not to return not to
[28:38] return hateful words and hateful things
[28:40] with with more hateful actions because
[28:42] that doesn't solve anything God wants us
[28:44] to love some one another when somebody
[28:46] does something wrong to you return love
[28:48] for it and that'll stop the devil in his
[28:50] tracks love is the answer and John was
[28:54] weeping there because who is going to
[28:56] open the book he he wasn't worthy in
[28:58] there in his own self he wasn't worthy
[29:01] nobody's worthy to open up that book and
[29:03] quickly we find his weeping stopped and
[29:05] one of the elders said don't weep John
[29:07] for the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[29:09] prevailed in other words overcome and
[29:12] has concered conquered and John turning
[29:15] he saw a lamb coming out and everything
[29:17] in heaven began to cry worthy oh I think
[29:22] oh certainly that that'll make somebody
[29:24] rejoice when they see what God has done
[29:26] what God has done in your life to look
[29:29] back and remember all the things all the
[29:31] challenges that God has brought you
[29:33] through all the things that's happened
[29:35] aren't you glad this afternoon couldn't
[29:37] we all say that aren't you glad that the
[29:39] price has been paid that we've got
[29:41] somebody to take all our iniquity and
[29:44] cover it over Wash It Away in the bleach
[29:46] of his blood and take care of it aren't
[29:48] you glad that you've got a lamb and
[29:50] we've got a lamb tonight we've got a
[29:52] lamb that can open up this book and
[29:53] reveal it to us and make the things
[29:55] plain I I I I thank God that we've got a
[29:59] revel we should have a revelation of the
[30:01] things as as the book begins to be open
[30:02] you think you think about that it was a
[30:05] lamb the lamb a lamb is the is the the
[30:08] animal that God wanted to represent
[30:11] himself as brother R preached that
[30:13] sermon the lamb and the dove talking
[30:14] about Jesus going out in the water as
[30:16] John the Baptist was standing there to
[30:18] baptize him and a Dove came it looked
[30:20] like a dove the Spirit come and and and
[30:22] landed on went into him and they're
[30:25] symbolizing Christ was symbolized in two
[30:28] of the meekest most mildest humblest
[30:31] creatures a lamb that that a lamb you
[30:34] lead a lamb to the slaughter and it's
[30:35] not going to fight back it's not going
[30:37] to say anything it'll just bite its
[30:39] tongue as Monica growing up she she
[30:42] heard uh her she'd wake up many times
[30:44] and see her her parents had killed a
[30:46] lamb the night before and the little
[30:47] lamb be laying there on the table as
[30:49] they clinged it and it its tongue would
[30:51] be hanging out cuz it would it would
[30:52] bite his tongue as it was killed the the
[30:54] meekest gentlest creature and that
[30:57] that's what Christ is the meekest
[30:59] humblest gentest creature so Meek that
[31:02] it could be led as Christ was led up to
[31:04] be crucified on that cross then oh you
[31:06] think that's what God wants us he's
[31:08] trying to mold us into that same kind of
[31:11] gentle Meek nature where we don't R back
[31:14] we're not constantly biting and
[31:16] devouring one another but that same
[31:18] gentle nature why because God wants us
[31:21] to wants to fill us with his Spirit and
[31:24] the spirit of the Lord is timid it's
[31:26] timid oh you see that's why God before
[31:28] before you first get the Holy Ghost
[31:30] God's got to clean your soul up he's got
[31:32] to get that old nasty Spirit out that
[31:34] unclean Spirit clean the place up
[31:36] because the Holy Ghost is timid and the
[31:38] Holy Ghost is not going to come rest on
[31:40] any unclean thing anything that's any
[31:42] anybody that's that oh what what are you
[31:45] talking about brother Rob I'm talking
[31:46] about why the necessity for the virtues
[31:49] that are on this board behind me to for
[31:52] that super anointing to come in the life
[31:54] of a Believer you got to have brotherly
[31:56] kindness
[31:57] you got to have patience oh if if you
[32:00] God cleaned you up before he filled your
[32:02] soul then what about when he FS you
[32:05] feels when he's going to feel every
[32:07] fiber of your Beating he's got to clean
[32:09] you up to a place where you're just Meek
[32:11] and gentle able to be led by the spirit
[32:14] when the spirit speaks to you and says
[32:16] go over there and go over here talk to
[32:18] this brother or whatever you're just
[32:20] you're just so in tune with the spirit
[32:22] that you listen to what the spirit says
[32:24] meek and humble that's what God wants a
[32:27] Believer to be and that's what John saw
[32:30] he saw a lamb coming forth from the
[32:32] throne and the lamb was worthy and the
[32:34] lamb was worthy we're not worthy but the
[32:36] lamb was worthy and the lamb will make
[32:38] you worthy so that you can read the book
[32:40] not by by your own power but by the
[32:43] power of the Holy Ghost God that's in
[32:45] you that has made you worthy because
[32:47] he's cleaned up your life and Sanctified
[32:49] you and covered you in his blood brother
[32:52] said the dove is the gentlest thing of
[32:53] Heaven and the lamb is the gentlest
[32:55] beast on Earth they had had to be the
[32:57] same if the dove would have flew on a
[32:59] wolf the wolf would have snorted and the
[33:02] dove would have taken his flight and
[33:03] that's the way today that we find
[33:05] ourselves with all our tempers and our
[33:08] fussing oh all our tempers and fussing
[33:11] the holy spirit is gentle it will only
[33:15] dwell in a gentle Place lamb led by a
[33:20] dove oh you think about when we come
[33:22] into the house of the Lord that's why we
[33:23] don't have uh we don't say our greetings
[33:25] and everything in the sanctuary we don't
[33:27] let their kids run up and down the aisle
[33:29] because the Holy Ghost is timid oh you
[33:31] want the holy ghost in your house just
[33:33] greet each other with love and stop all
[33:35] the yelling and screaming and have turn
[33:37] off that TV and turn on it turn on a
[33:40] little message and turn on some good old
[33:42] gospel music and set the atmosphere
[33:44] where the Holy Ghost will feel welcome
[33:46] oh I want the Holy Ghost to feel welcome
[33:49] I want him to be welcome in my life I
[33:50] want him to welcome in my home I want
[33:53] him to welcome in the things that I do
[33:55] even at work I want the I I I don't want
[33:58] to do anything that would displease the
[33:59] Holy Ghost because he's very timid and a
[34:02] testimony on the sea brother R said the
[34:04] holy spirit is very timid very timid it
[34:07] just won't tolerate nothing wrong they
[34:10] identifi Christ of all ages he said the
[34:12] holy spirit is timid very very timid and
[34:15] where you just have one unbeliever or a
[34:18] skeptic sitting around the Holy Spirit
[34:20] just can't work hardly that's why he had
[34:22] to tell everybody in jus' house get out
[34:25] everybody leave because the Holy Ghost
[34:27] has got to go to work and he can't do it
[34:29] in an atmosphere of unbelief somebody
[34:31] somebody at odds with what he's trying
[34:33] to do that's why God has got to he's
[34:35] changing your character to make you
[34:37] Gentle and meek and loving love somebody
[34:41] that hates you love somebody that back
[34:43] bites you love somebody that gossips
[34:45] about you that you can love that's what
[34:47] the Capstone is it's love you say well
[34:49] love is to do the will of the father
[34:51] well I thought the will of the father
[34:53] was to love my neighbor as myself I
[34:55] thought the will of the father was was
[34:57] to love the Lord thy God with all thy
[34:59] heart and all thy soul and then to love
[35:01] your neighbor as yourself and so you see
[35:03] it's all wrapped up in love it's love to
[35:06] love one another and to love God that's
[35:08] why the virtues of the stature of a
[35:10] perfect man are require that God is
[35:12] molding you into his character to be
[35:14] like him and act like him and walk like
[35:17] him and talk like him and react like him
[35:19] and behave like him oh Godly compassion
[35:22] is to do the will of God this this is a
[35:25] quote from brother Brandon Godly
[35:27] compassion is to do the will of God
[35:29] compassion in the Realms of spirit means
[35:31] to do the will of him that sent you oh
[35:33] think about how Paul was bound bound by
[35:36] chain and by feathers of love to do the
[35:39] will of God and that only so you think
[35:42] about think about what that Capstone is
[35:44] so you are so wrapped up in God until
[35:47] you only do the will of the father I do
[35:49] nothing except the father shows me I
[35:51] don't do anything except the father show
[35:53] me when the father reveals himself to
[35:55] you and reveals his word to you you you
[35:57] act upon that and nothing else if it's
[35:59] not in his word why because the
[36:01] Antichrist has been booted out you're
[36:03] it's word and word only you're not
[36:06] listening it's not one word off human
[36:09] love brother BR said would make you
[36:10] shoot a man on account of your wife but
[36:12] the love that comes from above would
[36:14] make you pray for his lost soul and
[36:17] that's the kind of love that God is
[36:18] going to have manifest in his bride but
[36:21] it takes God to produce Divine
[36:25] love you know the seals what what do
[36:28] they reveal they reveal what God has
[36:29] done down through the seven Church ages
[36:33] they reveal how God is going to redeem
[36:35] the Earth and they reveal what God has
[36:38] done in your life from your birth to
[36:41] being molded to be Christlike on up to
[36:44] where God finishes it by revealing the
[36:48] seven Thunders to give you Rapture in
[36:50] faith but there's nothing to reveal if
[36:53] Christ hasn't changed you that's why you
[36:56] go back and listen to how brother Dale
[36:57] used to preach it he say do you do you
[36:59] have a lamb do you have a lamb to reveal
[37:02] it and and he he would lay it down hard
[37:05] what's he what's what's the point he's
[37:07] trying to make it it behooves us to make
[37:10] sure I I like you'd say I I he used to
[37:13] say I'd rather go my whole life seeking
[37:15] to make sure that I really am born again
[37:18] than to find out the End come down come
[37:20] down to the wire and and and to find out
[37:23] maybe on your deathbed or something that
[37:24] you really never surrendered to God and
[37:27] I I I tell you there's many ways that
[37:30] you can examine yourself and see are you
[37:32] are you born again are you being changed
[37:35] is the word being open to you as you
[37:37] read the Bible is it being revealed to
[37:40] you or are you still are you still the
[37:41] same way that you were 20 or 30 years
[37:44] ago are you more in love today with the
[37:46] word as you were 20 or 30 years ago or
[37:49] has it become just some kind of a a
[37:51] boring thing where you're just kind of
[37:53] sitting there and going through the
[37:54] motions oh if you're not in love today
[37:56] today with with a God more than you were
[37:58] 20 or 30 years ago I I urge you to just
[38:01] fall in love fall back in love with him
[38:04] oh you that's why brother Brown when he
[38:05] was preaching the first seal he' he'd
[38:07] start talking about the foolish virgin
[38:09] that laying here in my notes the foolish
[38:11] virgin who were so foolish and and went
[38:13] and started on their Journey without oil
[38:16] and they got to the end and they
[38:18] realized that they heard the bridegroom
[38:20] call and they began to realize what I I
[38:22] should have carried oil with me I should
[38:24] have had some oil with me to keep my
[38:26] fire burning I I can't even trim my lamp
[38:28] now because I don't have o any oil to
[38:30] put into the
[38:31] lamp and the whole creation lays in his
[38:34] hand now on which the whole Plan of
[38:35] Redemption is sealed by seven mysterious
[38:38] seals in this book that he took and he
[38:41] alone can reveal it to whomsoever he
[38:44] will so we're depending on the lamb to
[38:47] give us understanding aren't
[38:49] we what does he do if he's a king he has
[38:53] to have subjects and his subjects is
[38:55] them that he has reded redeemed and they
[38:57] cannot come before him until he takes
[38:59] the rights of redemption and now he
[39:01] walks forth from a mediator where death
[39:03] put us in the grave he comes forth with
[39:06] the rights brother B would say this book
[39:09] actually oh you think about this book
[39:11] lay in there what what book is it it's a
[39:13] book of Christ and that's why that's why
[39:16] you know you have preachers say that the
[39:18] book was you but look look how the
[39:20] pattern is the book is Christ and when
[39:23] Christ is revealed it's it's a byproduct
[39:26] or side effect of that that it also
[39:28] reveals you oh you think about the three
[39:31] what is the three-fold mystery under the
[39:32] seventh seal first the seven Thunders
[39:35] reveal Christ and the second fold is
[39:37] that the bride is revealed see as the
[39:40] Christ is revealed it reveals the bride
[39:43] and that's how you when you when you
[39:44] begin to see Christ in his word unfold
[39:46] it reveals you also and this book Al I I
[39:51] I know y'all getting tired y'all like
[39:52] you preaching on iniquity on the in the
[39:54] on a Wednesday night
[39:57] see y I'm not going to keep you long
[39:59] tonight I I I know how it is I I'm I
[40:02] know I'm empathizing this this book
[40:06] actually was planned and written before
[40:07] the foundation of the world and this
[40:10] book so this book has you as part of it
[40:13] it's your name is in the book how is
[40:15] your name in the book that when you read
[40:17] it and God begins to reveal it to you
[40:19] you can identify yourself with the
[40:21] stories and the events and the things
[40:24] that are happening in this book and You
[40:26] Begin to identify yourself with the
[40:28] things that are taking place and when
[40:30] the seals begin to open up to you you
[40:32] can be you can begin to identify
[40:34] yourself with those things that are
[40:36] revealed from the back to the front of
[40:38] the Bible all through it and it opens up
[40:40] to you really that you you are part of
[40:43] this book that God thought of from
[40:45] before the foundation of the world
[40:47] you're part of it that just as he
[40:49] thought just as he spoke of Christ oh
[40:52] you think about this that everything
[40:54] that he said about Jesus Christ
[40:56] was also prophesied of you all the
[40:59] events of Jesus's life that he went to
[41:02] the water to be baptized that he went to
[41:04] mount Transfiguration to be adopted that
[41:06] he died to himself in the Garden of
[41:08] Gethsemane that he died and yielded up
[41:10] everything on the cross all those things
[41:12] lay a pattern for you that you look at
[41:15] that and identified with it just as you
[41:17] identified with the stories that are
[41:19] laid out in the Old Testament that speak
[41:21] of those things that we can read about
[41:23] when we look at Jesus Christ and Jesus
[41:26] Christ your name your your name your
[41:29] being who you are is all wrapped up in
[41:33] who Jesus Christ is this book actually
[41:36] was planned and written before the
[41:37] foundation of the world this book was
[41:39] really he said this book was really
[41:42] written before the foundation of the
[41:44] world I had that in my notes
[41:47] twice so y'all forgive me he said the
[41:50] lamb in the time of intercessory back
[41:52] here he knew that there were names in
[41:53] there that was put in there from the
[41:55] foundation of of world and as long as
[41:57] them names have never been manifested on
[42:00] Earth as yet he had to stay there as
[42:04] intercessor so what's God doing on the
[42:06] throne he's an intercessor is somebody
[42:09] who acts on behalf who intervenes on
[42:11] behalf of another so as these names are
[42:14] coming forth as these people are coming
[42:16] forth and hearing the word for their day
[42:18] he's intervening to make sure to to
[42:20] bring that body together until the last
[42:23] one is called and then we can all be
[42:25] called home
[42:26] then he can step forth and and open that
[42:29] book and reveal its contents and reveal
[42:32] reveal what
[42:34] happened oh brother Ram say that's
[42:36] perfectly predestination where was thou
[42:39] when I laid the foundation of the earth
[42:41] God asked job where were you you were
[42:43] your name was in a book and you weren't
[42:45] somebody like somewhere like a person
[42:48] but you were in God's thinking and God's
[42:50] thoughts are Eternal so God from
[42:52] eternity always knew that you were
[42:54] coming and he you had to come come and
[42:56] when he when you come with in every age
[42:59] somebody all these different all these
[43:00] different people down Through the Ages
[43:02] were coming and God's on the throne
[43:04] interceding taking care of them
[43:06] therefore as long as there wasn't one
[43:08] name had never yet been declared as long
[43:11] as there was one name hadn't never yet
[43:13] been declared in Earth Christ had to
[43:15] stay there as an intercessor to take
[43:18] care of that
[43:20] name each name being washed in the
[43:23] Clorox bleach of his blood amen right
[43:28] every name being
[43:29] washed until they're all
[43:32] redeemed and he said and then the book
[43:34] is a revelation so a revelation is
[43:37] something that's made known of something
[43:38] that's been revealed it's closed up
[43:40] until the latter time see the whole
[43:42] mystery of it is closed up until the
[43:44] latter time as the seals are broken and
[43:47] released the mysteries of the book are
[43:48] revealed the whole mystery of it's
[43:50] closed up who's in that book how are
[43:53] they redeemed what is the process all
[43:56] all those things are closed up but then
[43:57] it's revealed and when it's revealed oh
[44:00] you can see your name in the book then
[44:02] when it's revealed personally to you if
[44:04] you got a lamb if you've got the baptism
[44:07] of the Holy Ghost there to open up that
[44:10] that book up to you then you can see
[44:13] your name he said it's a scroll and then
[44:16] when the scroll is Unwound that's one
[44:18] then laying right in the scroll is
[44:19] number two and right here it says what
[44:22] it is but it's a mystery oh you think
[44:25] about now we've heard of it explained
[44:26] over and over again that the the book
[44:27] that we're talking about is not a book
[44:29] like what we read but it's a scroll and
[44:31] it's got you you open up you you you
[44:33] take that first seal off and then you
[44:35] read what's under under that first seal
[44:37] and you got to read it in order it's got
[44:40] to be broken in order you can't start on
[44:42] the seventh seal and then go back to the
[44:44] first seal it's got to start in order
[44:46] the first seal opens and then the second
[44:48] seal opens all the way down to the
[44:51] seventh seal and under the seventh seal
[44:54] are seven Thunders and the the seven
[44:56] Thunders is the end of the conclusion of
[44:59] the matter that's something very
[45:00] important to keep in mind what is this
[45:02] book of redemption this title deed
[45:04] Abstract title deed he you say abstract
[45:07] what does an abstract mean means it
[45:08] search all the way back to its beginning
[45:11] like that little drop of ink this
[45:12] morning when it struck that bleach it
[45:14] went all the way back and when sin has
[45:16] been confessed and fallen into the blood
[45:18] of Jesus Christ it gives an abstract
[45:21] right straight back to the Creator again
[45:23] and you become a Son of God the the
[45:26] abstract title deed is held into the
[45:28] hand in the hand of that Almighty of the
[45:30] almighty and that's what the complete
[45:31] revelation of this book is it shows that
[45:34] there's no squatter it shows you the
[45:36] devil got to get off your property
[45:39] because you can trace it all the way
[45:40] back oh oh you you think about what God
[45:43] is doing as you grow in Grace and
[45:45] knowledge and the devil's been telling
[45:47] you all this stuff all the time you
[45:49] ain't worth nothing I you ain't even
[45:52] called to preach the gospel whatever he
[45:53] tells people he's going to tell
[45:55] something different the different ones
[45:57] but you grow to the place where you
[45:58] realize no what what is the what is the
[46:01] antidote to all the stuff that devil can
[46:03] throw to you it's re throw at you it's
[46:05] Revelation Revelation the word a
[46:08] revelation of the word when when the
[46:10] devil came to tempt Jesus and he and he
[46:13] and he kept at turn these stones into
[46:14] bread what what did Jesus do back at him
[46:16] the word the word and that's how you'll
[46:18] defeat the Devil every time when it
[46:20] begins to tell you I don't think you're
[46:22] really a Christian you give him the word
[46:24] back because if you got a Revelation I
[46:26] am a Christian I I because I can
[46:29] identify myself in the word then then
[46:32] what's the devil won't have a leg to
[46:34] stand on oh you see what's revealed in
[46:36] these seals that the devil is a bluff oh
[46:38] when you when you come to the place
[46:39] where you realize the devil the devil
[46:42] this this abstract title deed searches
[46:44] it all the way back and the devil has
[46:46] got to go because he's not an owner he's
[46:49] just a squatter he's got to go an
[46:51] abstract title de searches all the way
[46:53] back to see who if there's any lean
[46:56] problems on the land if any ownership
[46:58] problems any and it it'll you know what
[47:00] another thing an abstract title to eat
[47:02] is it'll give you a detailed description
[47:05] of the property now that's why that's
[47:07] why we've got the seals have got to be
[47:09] open to us so we know what we got access
[47:11] to because it'll give you a detailed
[47:14] description of everything that you've
[47:16] got access to you've got access to full
[47:19] Redemption it's Redemption the
[47:21] Redemption of the of the mean it
[47:24] Redemption means all legal POS
[47:25] possession to all that was lost by Adam
[47:28] and Eve that you possess everything that
[47:31] Adam and Eve lost now Adam and Eve we
[47:33] know Adam and Eve had were in speaking
[47:36] conditions they could if they didn't
[47:37] like the weather they could they could
[47:39] make the breeze blow a little bit better
[47:41] they had that spoken word air
[47:43] conditioning system if they was if it
[47:45] was too hot they could just speak and
[47:46] the wind would blow a little bit oh but
[47:48] think about all the other things that
[47:50] you got access to if you've got a true
[47:53] revelation of this these of this book
[47:55] that you got access to healing in your
[47:57] body because what is the rapture it's
[48:00] that final that final sweep of healing
[48:02] over your body you've got access to a
[48:04] sound mind when the Devil comes to you
[48:07] with all of his lies well I don't think
[48:08] you're this I don't think you that you
[48:10] just tell him what the word says and
[48:12] tell him well listen I got a benefit
[48:14] package y'all know y'all know how I
[48:16] preach I I got a benefit package that I
[48:18] could claim access to it'll give you it
[48:21] searches all the way back to you you
[48:23] you've got deliverance from complexes
[48:26] Oh Glory to God I think we should all
[48:28] praise from that surely we've all got
[48:30] complexes that we've been delivered from
[48:32] of and maybe maybe even right now we've
[48:34] got complexes that we're dealing with
[48:36] what we think we're what what is a
[48:37] complex it's a devil pestering you and
[48:40] hammering you and telling you like a
[48:42] minister nobody cares about your
[48:44] preaching and that'll be a complex and
[48:46] what it is it's the devil the devil
[48:48] telling you that or maybe a young person
[48:50] sitting there and and and and the devil
[48:52] will tell you nobody cares about you
[48:54] nobody in the church cares you're just
[48:56] on your own and it ain't nothing but the
[48:57] devil oh but God when God really comes
[49:00] on the scene and gives you a revelation
[49:02] that he does care then that changes
[49:05] everything you you know sometimes you
[49:07] you look and see some how how people
[49:10] respond to preaching and I think one of
[49:13] the one of the
[49:14] most how to word this you'll see some of
[49:17] the most drastic responses when you're
[49:20] preaching about how much God
[49:23] cares you almost see because people it's
[49:26] the devil has beat on people to so much
[49:29] until they they don't think nobody cares
[49:31] and they just get down in a valley of
[49:34] depression oh but that's what God wants
[49:36] you to know that he does care and when
[49:38] it's preached it begins to create like a
[49:40] confidence in the people something
[49:41] begins to happen CU they they need to
[49:43] hear that oh oh but don't let just a
[49:45] minister tell you that he cares let God
[49:48] speak to you let that voice of God
[49:50] Thunder out in your heart so that you
[49:52] know that he cares and it's not somebody
[49:55] that preacher told you in a prayer line
[49:57] that you're born again or a preacher
[49:59] told you some somewhere that that God
[50:01] cares about you but when God cares when
[50:04] God tells you himself that will change
[50:07] everything oh that's why it's so
[50:09] important for you to be born again it's
[50:11] so important you got to be born again
[50:14] because being born again is when God is
[50:16] speaking to you personally and when you
[50:18] read the letters on the page it's not
[50:21] because somebody educated you into it or
[50:23] told you a bunch of theology but God is
[50:26] actually revealing his word to you and
[50:28] quickening it to you and making it a
[50:30] living reality in you and giving you
[50:32] something to fight the devil
[50:39] with oh you think about all these things
[50:41] that we've got access to a righteous
[50:44] life oh think that we we can live by the
[50:47] power of the Holy Ghost our righteous
[50:50] holy life devoid of a complex where you
[50:54] feel like you got to lash out at
[50:56] somebody in anger because they don't
[50:57] like you or you feel like you got to get
[51:00] back at somebody oh thank God that he
[51:02] give us the power to live a life where
[51:04] we can love one another and forgive one
[51:06] another oh and if you can't do that
[51:09] tonight oh that's what God wants you to
[51:11] do is give it over to God if somebody's
[51:14] wronged you or treated you wrong just
[51:16] put it all on him and say I I want God I
[51:19] want you to take away this old bitter
[51:21] cold heart of mine and change me so that
[51:24] I can love somebody else
[51:26] oh that's the holy ghost power that the
[51:28] opening of the seals is meant to give
[51:30] the church a righteous life and healing
[51:32] and sound mind and back to spoken word
[51:35] conditions where if you don't like that
[51:37] mountain you can speak to it and it'll
[51:40] move out of the way listen there's a
[51:42] prom it might seem outlandish but
[51:44] there's a promise laying in the Bible
[51:45] that somebody's faith is going to grow
[51:48] from a little small dot of Mustard Seed
[51:50] Faith until it is mountains side fa size
[51:53] faith and that mountain size faith is
[51:56] going to tell the mountain get out of
[51:58] the way it's going to tell the Sun and
[52:00] the Moon like Joshua to stop or whatever
[52:02] the need is because you believe what God
[52:06] has spoken and that is what is laying in
[52:09] the seals now Adam could not meet the
[52:11] requirements of redemption I I'm I'm not
[52:13] even going to hard I thought I thought I
[52:15] didn't have enough notes tonight
[52:17] y'all Adam could not meet the
[52:19] requirements of redemption after he lost
[52:21] it he needed Redemption himself so he
[52:24] could not do it
[52:26] and you and I can't do it either by our
[52:28] works oh we need God to come on the
[52:30] scene we need a lamb to open up the book
[52:34] now we got a lamb if you got the new
[52:36] birth we got a lamb the lamb is the only
[52:40] one that can reveal it now this is one
[52:43] of my favorite quotes in the message
[52:46] I've been I've been sitting on this
[52:47] quote for years saying I'm one day I'm
[52:50] going to I'm going to preach
[52:53] this and here it is this is one of the
[52:56] most profound think about this now we've
[52:58] been you think when is the Lamb going to
[53:01] come forth all these kind of things and
[53:03] brother man made this statement as he
[53:04] was preaching the first seal he said and
[53:08] now the lamb is standing now
[53:14] tonight he's got the book in his hand
[53:18] and starting to reveal
[53:21] it
[53:23] now the lamb is standing now
[53:27] tonight he's got the book in his hand
[53:31] and starting to reveal it oh you think
[53:34] about it's not something to look way off
[53:36] in the future put something way way off
[53:38] somewhere but he's stand now back then
[53:40] brother brand preaching that sermon
[53:42] years how many decades ago I don't know
[53:44] I can't do the math now many decades ago
[53:46] standing there preaching a a and the
[53:49] lamb there was standing there o ready to
[53:52] open the book but for years it's been
[53:54] closed to so many it it's been close to
[53:56] me I didn't know what it was but then
[53:58] one day the lamb will come forth and
[54:02] reveal it now wherever you are wherever
[54:06] you are in your journey it's possible to
[54:10] understand what is written in this book
[54:13] maybe maybe you're sitting there and
[54:14] your mind is closed and you're wondering
[54:16] I will I ever understand all these
[54:18] things all these things that are that
[54:20] that seem so what are the four beasts
[54:23] what what is Iniquity what really what
[54:26] what is the thunder what's the seven
[54:27] Thunders all these bits and pieces to go
[54:30] together oh but oh let me just encourage
[54:32] you get that get that fervor like the
[54:35] berans did when they get to went to
[54:37] flipping through the Bible to see if the
[54:38] things that they had heard about were
[54:39] really true because God will reveal it
[54:42] to somebody that really wants it that's
[54:45] right if you want it he will reveal it
[54:48] to
[54:49] you when the seals completely are broken
[54:52] brother R said the time of redemption is
[54:54] over Redemption is over it's complete
[54:56] the process of redemption is over he
[54:58] comes forth he stands he stands up takes
[55:00] the book to show that there's nothing
[55:03] else that has to be done in that process
[55:05] of redemption the time of redemption is
[55:08] over because the lamb left the
[55:10] intercession post to walk out to take
[55:12] his claims when the real Revelation
[55:14] happens on the seals as they begin to
[55:16] break the lamb is coming forth from the
[55:19] sanctuary now doesn't that paint just a
[55:21] beautiful picture that the sanctuary all
[55:24] smoke
[55:25] and the Lamb's coming forth he's coming
[55:29] forth and as he's coming forth to make
[55:31] his presence revealed to make himself
[55:35] known things begin to be
[55:39] understood and brother Ram will say here
[55:41] is the plan of
[55:43] it y'all doing all
[55:46] right here is the plan of it I I really
[55:49] I'm not I'm just a few more minutes five
[55:51] five or 10 minutes and then we'll
[55:54] close
[55:55] the first thing happens there is an
[55:57] announcement in the heavens
[55:59] first what happened a seal is open what
[56:02] is that a mystery is unfolded the Angel
[56:04] of the church catches the mystery of God
[56:06] not fully yet revealed but when he does
[56:08] he catches this mystery of God and then
[56:10] he goes forth to the people just like
[56:12] here come forth in the early ches church
[56:14] ages will get it after a while a do look
[56:16] he's laying forth this pattern he's
[56:18] laying this pattern out that that down
[56:20] through the church ages a little bit
[56:22] would be known known known and then
[56:24] there at the end the seventh Church age
[56:27] messenger would come now look at this
[56:29] pattern he's laying out the seventh
[56:31] Church aged messenger would come and tie
[56:33] up all the Loose Ends and finish it so
[56:35] the seventh Church age messenger is the
[56:37] end right it finishes all the all the
[56:40] ties up all the Loose Ends and all the
[56:42] Mysteries are revealed when that seventh
[56:44] Church age messenger preaches when it
[56:47] preaches his message well in the same
[56:49] way the seals are unfolded in the same
[56:52] manner where the seals open and they
[56:55] open and they open and they open but the
[56:57] seventh seal under the seventh seal
[56:59] seven thunder sound and the seventh seal
[57:01] is the end of all thing and we know this
[57:03] we've heard it preached before the
[57:04] seventh seal is Christ but the seventh
[57:06] seal under those seven Mysteries it's
[57:08] all wrapped up it's all tied up that's
[57:10] why there's silence in heaven for for a
[57:12] half hour because he said it was
[57:15] like every that sitting there between
[57:19] wondering you know wondering something's
[57:21] got to happen something's got to unfold
[57:23] because the seventh Seal's got to finish
[57:25] it brings the conclusion of the whole
[57:27] thing it end it shows the end the end of
[57:30] the devil's work the end the end of the
[57:32] whole matter and at the end brother R
[57:35] said at the end of the Pentecostal age
[57:37] I'm talking about patterns now I think
[57:39] it's so helpful to be able to see these
[57:41] patterns in scripture so that we
[57:43] understand what's happening just like
[57:44] Moses went up on top of the mountain he
[57:46] saw the pattern that God had laid out
[57:47] for him to go back down and build
[57:49] because when we see the pattern laid out
[57:51] it helps us to understand you know
[57:54] sometimes you know if you if you stretch
[57:55] it way out across many many many sermons
[57:57] then you'll forget at the end what was
[57:59] talked about at the end but if we can
[58:00] see the whole pattern to begin with then
[58:02] we kind of have a frame of reference
[58:04] where we see where we're going and
[58:05] brother R would say at the end of the
[58:07] Pentecostal age we are supposed to
[58:09] receive according to the word as God
[58:11] helped me tonight to show you that
[58:12] through here that we are to receive a
[58:14] messenger that will take all those loose
[58:17] ends out there and reveal the whole
[58:19] Secret Of God for the rapturing of the
[58:22] church all down through the 7 Church
[58:25] ages messenger reveal just little bits
[58:27] and pieces Martin Luther saw
[58:29] justification and Luther saw
[58:30] sanctification and on and on but here at
[58:32] the end the end it's all wrapped up
[58:35] together and seven Thunders will be
[58:37] revealed in the last days in order to
[58:39] get the bride together for rapturing
[58:41] Faith because what we got right now we
[58:43] wouldn't be able to do it we've got to
[58:45] step farther we got we got to oh see
[58:48] last time we were talking about the
[58:49] importance of the Seven Seals and I I
[58:52] want to ress that as we're about to
[58:54] close here that we must understand the
[58:57] Seven Seals because the Seven Seals
[58:59] gives us the understanding and the
[59:01] Revelation from God that those it's
[59:03] going to draw those dead Saints out of
[59:05] the Grave so be diligent be sure make
[59:08] sure you really are a genuine
[59:11] believer amen and not as brother Ram
[59:14] preached in the first seal a foolish
[59:16] version not just somebody that thinks
[59:19] they are are are real and true but isn't
[59:21] carrying oil to put in their lamb
[59:27] all right here we get 2 Thessalonians
[59:30] chapter 2:7 for the mystery of iniquity
[59:33] doth already work only he who now lth
[59:36] will let until he be taken out of the
[59:42] way who he that
[59:44] lth see a
[59:47] mystery the mystery of iniquity way back
[59:50] in that very first church age here
[59:53] here's Paul writing saying that the
[59:56] mystery of iniquity what mystery of
[59:59] iniquity
[1:00:01] deceivers deceivers somebody deceiving
[1:00:03] you off the people off into something
[1:00:06] what is it it's a spirit working to
[1:00:10] deceive now you think about as we're as
[1:00:12] we're about ready to close I'm I'm not
[1:00:13] making vain promises we we'll close in
[1:00:15] just a moment as a spirit we are
[1:00:17] influenced by spirits and this mystery
[1:00:20] of iniquity is a spirit that influenced
[1:00:23] people in that first church
[1:00:25] it influences still today because it's
[1:00:28] it's moving on it's this what is it it's
[1:00:30] that it's the devil we're influenced by
[1:00:33] spirits and Satan was that first
[1:00:35] influencer you go back all the way back
[1:00:37] to the very beginning that the the war
[1:00:39] waged in heaven between Michael and and
[1:00:41] the angels and the angels that that left
[1:00:44] and and then those angels were cast down
[1:00:46] to heaven and now those angels the
[1:00:48] fallen angels and the real true loyal
[1:00:51] angels to God are influencing people to
[1:00:54] go one one way or the other now Ezekiel
[1:00:57] chapter 28 it says Thou Art the anointed
[1:00:59] cherub that
[1:01:00] coverthe so thou was upon the holy
[1:01:03] mountain of God speaking of Satan thou
[1:01:05] has walked up and down in the midst of
[1:01:07] the stones of fire thou was perfect in
[1:01:09] thy ways from the days that thou was
[1:01:11] created till iniquity was found in thee
[1:01:15] what what is Iniquity iniquity is
[1:01:18] something that you know you ought not to
[1:01:20] do and you do it anyhow now see there's
[1:01:23] the thing where we start if we really
[1:01:25] examine ourselves if you really examine
[1:01:27] yourselves you you start finding there
[1:01:29] there's iniquity like and and you start
[1:01:32] wonder if you really exam look in the
[1:01:34] mirror when you get home why do I do
[1:01:37] stuff that I know I shouldn't do why you
[1:01:42] know you preach and you preach and you
[1:01:43] preach you that you need to come to
[1:01:45] church you need to read your Bible or
[1:01:47] here's here's something to think about
[1:01:51] that you need to be born again and yet
[1:01:54] people people won't do it you you can
[1:01:56] preach and preach and preach and you
[1:01:58] know you know what the Bible says that
[1:02:00] you need to come and be baptized the
[1:02:02] right way and yet people all around the
[1:02:03] world like think about all those
[1:02:05] ministers that brother Ram would preach
[1:02:07] at them and they said we are going to be
[1:02:09] baptized the right way and they didn't
[1:02:12] do it I I was actually reading this
[1:02:15] sermon the other day where he was
[1:02:16] talking about that and he said they
[1:02:17] promised that they were going to come
[1:02:19] and be baptized the right way and and
[1:02:21] then they never showed up and you think
[1:02:23] about that now think about that tonight
[1:02:25] as we're meditating on these things why
[1:02:27] is that that somebody would know what to
[1:02:31] do but won't do it and we're all guilty
[1:02:35] it all because it's a iniquity is a a
[1:02:38] symptom of the Fall In the Garden and
[1:02:41] we're all products of iniquity we've all
[1:02:44] been born shaping in iniquity and so you
[1:02:46] can you look at yourself and you say why
[1:02:48] am I the way I am because because
[1:02:50] there's iniquity why would anybody do
[1:02:53] something that they know they shouldn't
[1:02:57] do how do I get rid of
[1:03:00] that why would somebody do something
[1:03:02] they don't they know they shouldn't
[1:03:04] do why would eve eat from the tree when
[1:03:07] God told her not to well we know what
[1:03:10] happened the devil see that's what
[1:03:11] that's what that mystery of iniquity is
[1:03:13] it's a deceiver preaching something just
[1:03:16] like the devil come along and was
[1:03:18] preaching something to Eve there's that
[1:03:20] mystery of iniquity what's what's a
[1:03:22] mystery it's a mystery because you're
[1:03:23] like there's something something moving
[1:03:26] here and it's not revealed yet but
[1:03:29] that's what Paul is saying in 2
[1:03:30] Thessalonians sooner or later you keep
[1:03:32] following along and after a while it's
[1:03:34] got a crown on his head after a while
[1:03:36] it's sitting sitting there in the temple
[1:03:38] of God and oh there it is oh I see but
[1:03:42] but there's something behind there all
[1:03:44] that time that it was a m it was a
[1:03:45] mysterious thing that Paul could only
[1:03:47] speak about in vague terms of mystery of
[1:03:50] iniquity but it's that thing that that
[1:03:52] that it's the devil moving and and it
[1:03:55] might not be quite manifest in the early
[1:03:58] stages but you give it enough time and
[1:04:00] you for before long it's G to it's going
[1:04:04] to come out like like it came out with
[1:04:07] Judas hiding in Judas until all of a
[1:04:10] sudden boom what is Iniquity iniquity in
[1:04:15] Hebrew is that word Aon that means to
[1:04:19] bend or twist or distort it's like a
[1:04:23] crooked old man that that's walking his
[1:04:26] back's are crooked and he's walking with
[1:04:28] a cane and and it's all twisted up so
[1:04:30] you take God's word and you twist it and
[1:04:33] there you've got iniquity so it's bent
[1:04:36] and it's not the right thing it's not
[1:04:38] living right it's something that it's
[1:04:40] distorted so iniquities are bending
[1:04:43] twisting or distorting of the law of
[1:04:46] God's word to different
[1:04:49] degrees in Isaiah chapter 53 he said all
[1:04:52] we like sheep have gone astray we have
[1:04:54] turned everyone to his own
[1:04:57] way every one of us everybody is guilty
[1:05:01] and the Lord oh think about this the
[1:05:03] next part of this and the lord has laid
[1:05:06] on him the iniquity of us all now if you
[1:05:10] can think that's really the conclusion
[1:05:12] of my sermon tonight you think you think
[1:05:14] what does this got to do with the first
[1:05:16] seal meditate on these things that God
[1:05:19] has taken all of our
[1:05:22] iniquity all of our iniquity and it's
[1:05:25] all laid on him that he's got the
[1:05:28] problem for our iniquity solved if we'll
[1:05:31] just trust in him amen amen in Psalm
[1:05:35] chapter 66 it says if I regard iniquity
[1:05:37] in my heart the Lord will not hear me
[1:05:40] when you know that you should stay with
[1:05:42] the word of God as brother R said you
[1:05:44] know that you should stay with the word
[1:05:46] of God but for the church's sake or
[1:05:48] somebody else's sake or something else
[1:05:51] you'll stray from the word of God and do
[1:05:53] what the organ organization says oh to
[1:05:55] think about think about what a crooked
[1:05:58] Twisted distorted thing that is to see
[1:06:01] the word of God laid out plainly and say
[1:06:04] no I'm not going to do
[1:06:07] it oh we that's why we've got to be born
[1:06:11] again you got to be born
[1:06:14] again I'm I'm trying to find a closing
[1:06:17] Place y'all let me skip through
[1:06:19] my I'm skipping all these quotes about
[1:06:22] iniquity I'm skipping all these things
[1:06:27] down we'll close on this brother Brown
[1:06:30] said Remember When the foolish virgin
[1:06:32] went to buy
[1:06:34] oil he said oh you say now wait a minute
[1:06:36] brother brandham I don't know about that
[1:06:38] when they went to buy oil when they come
[1:06:41] back the bride was done gone and the
[1:06:43] door was shut and they knocked and said
[1:06:47] let us in let us in but they were in
[1:06:49] outer darkness and you
[1:06:51] know that you must be born again you
[1:06:56] must be born again in Psalm 51 it says
[1:06:58] behold I was shapen in iniquity and in
[1:07:00] sin my mother did conceive me you think
[1:07:03] about what iniquity is to know that you
[1:07:05] need to do as musicians come forward and
[1:07:07] we'll close on this to know that you you
[1:07:09] got to do something and you won't do it
[1:07:12] and you know you know tonight that you
[1:07:15] must be born again it's iniquity if you
[1:07:18] won't be born again if you won't give
[1:07:20] your heart to God and do oh God don't
[1:07:23] require Works he don't require you to do
[1:07:26] like a Catholic and push a penny up a a
[1:07:28] bunch of steps or something and do a
[1:07:30] bunch of novenas he doesn't even require
[1:07:31] you to come to the minister and confess
[1:07:33] all your sins what God requires is for
[1:07:35] you to submit to him and be born again
[1:07:38] be born again and let him take of your
[1:07:39] iniquity away be born again and let him
[1:07:42] take the sin problem away in Psalm 51
[1:07:45] behold thou desirest truth in the inward
[1:07:47] parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt
[1:07:48] make me to know wisdom Purge me with
[1:07:51] hsip and I shall be clean wash me and I
[1:07:53] shall be wider than
[1:07:56] snow oh if we just let God wash us he'll
[1:07:59] make us wider than snow he'll take all
[1:08:03] all of that sin problem all that sin
[1:08:05] curse and wash it away in the Clorox
