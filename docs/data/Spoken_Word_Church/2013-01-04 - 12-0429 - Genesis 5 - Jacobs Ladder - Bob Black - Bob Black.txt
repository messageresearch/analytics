========================================

last time we were looking at uh Genesis five and uh we're comparing that with the genealogies in Matthew and Luke so let's start off at just five or four the the theme of this lesson is going to be this is five that's talking about death because Adam sold Us in the dead and somehow we had to get back it's a lie and Matthew last time we talked about how Matthew Martin Luke and John present Christ in four different ways as a lion is a servant as a uh as a man the son of man as as uh as God and Matthew the genealogies and Matthew and Luke present him as the one that's going to come back to give us life that we can become part of him again and have return us to fellowship with God so justify think about that think of think of it as as the the book of the generations of Adam is the book of uh it's a testimony of what Adam lost this is the book of the generations of Adam and the day that God created man in the likeness of God made him he was made in the likeness of God and then he lost he lost he found out that he was naked when he uh took the sin upon himself and uh lost his privilege male and female created EDM and blessed them and called their name Adam and the day when they were created from the beginning they both went by the same name it wasn't the evil they were both known as Adam because he was so much a part of Adam that she shared his genes she shared his they had to they were they came from the same Spirit as he was born with his flesh bone of his bone flesh of his flesh after his image and called his name Sith now he was created the image of God now he's in a sinful statement he's uh he began a son in his likeness now in his in his sinful image and the whole thing with this is there's no there's no man today is worthy to take the book there's no man that is uh uh as we go along we're gonna look at genes a little bit and find out that there's no nobody in the generations of Adam that was worthy to take us back to into fellowship with God and the days of Adam after he had begotten himself for 800 years and he begat sons and daughters and all the days that Adam lived were 930 years he died 930 years are significant because nobody lived longer than Adam except from Methuselah who lived 969 years so think of this all all the way up to the flood with a Meg the father Miller was about 56 years old is when Adam died so Adam was a witness and a testimony to everyone up to the flood of what had happened in the garden all the way up to the flood you could have gone and spoke to Adam face to face and said what really happened in the garden and you could ask him questions all the way up right to the father and all the days of let's see and said to lived in 105 years and they get anus and Seth lived after he began Enos 807 years and we got sons and daughters and all the days of sets were 912 years and he died and Enos lived 90 years and we get canned and Enos lived after he would get Kane at 815 let's skip them down to you know verse 21. and Enoch left 60 in five years and began Methuselah you know find out he had a personal relationship with God because he walked with him and he can't walk with God if you can't walk with somebody unless you're in agree with him that's Amos 3-3 I can two walk together unless they be agreed and God gave peanut a revelation of something that was going to happen and that's why he named his son Methuselah when he is dead it shall be sinned because when Methuselah died but those will live until about 350 60 years after Noah was born and when he died the flood came so in it Methuselah was a living testimony that judgment was coming on the Earth 300 years and beget sons and daughters so he lived 300 a day for uh every uh 365 years let's see let's see what notes I have from you know and it was the seventh from Adam and seven is if if you look at the numbers that uh how brother Brandon presented numbers there's different quotes that present like the number seven in different ways he said the number seven is perfection completion rest worship and the number six represents man and kind of think of as man's separation from God but number seven returns a man to God so that he can participate in true worship true rest with God six of Separation as man trying to do something for himself the seven is returning to God for the seventh from Adam achieved rest with God in profession a perfect walk a communion with God that he had reached a moral Fitness because in first John 1 through 1 6 it says if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another in the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin if we say that we have no same way to see for ourselves right the truth is not in US and you know a lot of times especially new Believers think that uh you got to get everything at once but anyway with God for 300 years he didn't get everything it was it was slow and steady wins the race he uh he persevered after 300 years he still was walking with God and Hebrews 11 5 it says that he Enoch please God by faith in it was translated that he should not receive death and was not found because God had translated him for before he had this his Trent before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God and how do we please God the only way you can please God Is by faith so without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder and that diligently seek him Ena was a witness for God because in Jude 114 that says in enig also the seventh from Adam prophesied of these saying behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all the road LEDs which they have ungodly committed and of all their hard speeches which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him so edict was an example of the faithful believer the Rapture Saints and a witness to Adam's genealogy of what could have been what brother Branham wrote about did you say or said about it in the Easter seal 1965 and when it come time and he walked to a poem he quickened him he took his mortal body up in a ratchet I'm gonna talk about what the latter is in a second in 1965 it is the rising of the Sun in it with that perfect testimony that everything that God told me to do I did it everything that I've seen he said for me do I've done it and he becomes such as dynamics of mechanics until when the quickening power struck him the mechanics it just lifted him right up he walked on out of the earth into heaven if any kind of Revelation from God not only of what was going to happen to the world that the flood was going to come but he also had a revelation of how to get out of here and so he put a monument in Egypt but for how to escape that modern that money must survive the flood in fact if you look at pictures you can still see the water line of where the flood receiving on the pyramid so Enix pyramid was a timepiece all right I brought around talked about how that we're at the king's chamber it's a model of how to take a body change a model of a stitch you're a perfect man because it's got seven steps inside of it when you get into the king's Spirit the king's chamber it's the dimensions are exactly the same size as the holy of holies in that little call from that nobody knows what it's for because they didn't find a body in it they thought it was a burial chamber the the Coffer is the exact same size as if if you were to take the Ark of the Covenant and drop it in it would hold the Ark of the Covenant perfectly so yeah all down through Genesis chapter five as we're reading these names it says that Annie died and he died and he died and he died right because Adam sold us into them and Adam all died and you know death is a simple thing of Christianity I had him sold us into death and we had to have someone come back a perfect sacrifice come to redeem us from death into life but then after he died we also have to die Jesus said I'm crucified with Christ and yet I leave that's a great mystery he said I died daily and it to typify our death we're a bird in baptism and to and then to show that we are we die to the things of this world through our own flesh the old our old husband is crucified it's killed and so that we can be married in Christ death is a central part so we need to get back to what uh Matthew and Luke testify of which is a coming Redeemer and uh to get back God had to bridge provide a bridge between Heaven and Earth now brother random talked about how all down through history he tried to find somebody to Anchor this ladder from the Throne of God in heaven so that we could get back right he tried to Anchor me to Adam he tried to Anchor it to Jacob the old shyster tried to he kept trying to find somebody to Anchored to but nobody was perfect because Adam has told us all in the city the only one that he could find anchor to was the son of man amen so let's turn to Genesis 28. thank you y'all forgive me my horses a little bit uh we're gonna start at verse 11. let me let me set up a story so Jacob the little shockster has done everything he could to get the birthright because it was so important to him he would borrow still live whatever it took to get that Birthright right in in the last chapter Esau was ready to kill him so his mama says you need you need to get out of here and at the top of chapter 28 I said Isaac called him and said listen don't take one of the dollars of payment uh arise good put that around for the house of Beth will that mother's father and so Jacob runs runs away and he's afraid that he's the guy at the end of the Esau and Jacob in verse 11. he lighted up on a certain place and Terry there all night because the sun will set and he took of the soul to that place and put them for his pillow this place was called Luz which means separation he was separated from everything he knew of separated from the things of the world and God brother random said when he put his head down on this Stone God put him into a coma that's what Burt random said and gave him a vision yeah when you know this the whole thing of death God really can't do nothing until you're all totally out of the way and death and Jacob had his head laid down in the dust of the Earth on this rock you know this rock the the Jews say that this same rock is the foundation stone of the temple it's the what the holy of holies was built on and if you go to Jerusalem now they've got the uh in the mosque of Omar they call it the pierced Stone because it has a hole in it that goes down into The Well of Souls appears just like The Rock The Rock of our Salvation was pierced and verse 12 and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above me and said I am the Lord God of Abraham my father and the god of Isaac we're on thou lies to thee will I give it until I see you and our seed shall be as a dust of the earth and now I'm shall spread abroad to the West into the East and to the north and to the South and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the Earth be blessed right not just the families of Israel but all the families of the Earth right call them Jesus anybody can be saved believe and behold I am with thee and we'll keep thee in all places without ghosts and will bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I've spoken to the uh and Jacob awaked out of his sleep and he says surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not and he was afraid and said how Dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the Gate of Heaven and Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and pour the oil up on the top of it and he called the name of that place Bethel but the name of that city was called love means the house of God right and Jacob battle The Vow saying if God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and Raymond to put all so that I come again to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my God that's how a lot of us are we'll make a condition after God's already told us all of our his promises we'll say well if God will do this for me then I'll serve him and this Stone which I've set for a pillar shall be John's house that of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee so we can see in this story how God selects those who have nothing and gives them everything Jacob I'd run away from everything he know he knew it was completely separated but though he was completely alone and friendless as far as the world is concerned God showed him a vision that his interests were visiting all of Heaven the Angels ascending and descending to bring a message to make God's word manifest to manifest his attributes and his people brother Randall said in the infallibility of God spoken word in 1956 he lives that anchoring place where Jacobs what a promise he would be he was God's Eternal promise seed he was that sure stone that perfect Foundation that God's truth would anchor in and all devils in hell and everything else could never move it God had anchored it forever he'll see the angels of God and these ascending and descending upon the son of man the unity of one God and the one Church in 1958 and did you ever think of the Tower of Babylon and compare it with Jacob's Ladder how that they were trying to build a stair strips around the title that are reaching them into heaven only trying to pervert Jacob's Ladder which reached from the Heavens to the Earth and Angels descending and ascending perverting it foreign the faith of Abraham he said you was baptized by the grace of God and this great big arcade that's got every Redemptive blessing in it Everything Jesus died for is right here in the body of Christ healing salvation joy and peace all these things belongs to you it's yours the availability of God spoken a word in 1956 he said but God made the Covenant unconditionally and he hooked it into Christ Jesus there is Anchor there's no slipping and sliding there's no way of getting away what is it it's hooked by God above and by the Son of God beneath and what is it it's a pathway it's a traveler's way from Earth to glory and you can't fail look there's great companies of angels up and down here ascending and descending picking up the weary and the sick healing their bodies that show invasions and mighty signs and wonders can't fail it can't slip it can't slide you're safe God said so that sells it forever it's hooked around the heart of God of Heaven looked around the Son of God down here and we're brought into it through the Son of God we Ascend to him then what you scared about I promise between God and Christ and we're in between them with angels He said he will give his angels charge I believe and the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him and all up and down when we're making this Foundation climbing each day higher and higher each day brings me to one around higher higher move up up anything happens if I fall along the road or something happens to me there's a great host of Angels standing there to pick me up come on we're marching on up towards Zion on up to that beautiful city above now what a lot of people tie up Jacobs Jacob's Ladder with because you can see how he's he's anchored into Christ at the bottom in the Throne of God at the top and we're in the middle climbing up and he said I had a lot of other folks that I forgot to print out but he said we're you get up to sanctification you can look it back and see where you came from get up to the baptism of the Holy Ghost you look back to where you came from to see how far you've gotten and if you need any promise of God you just keep climbing up that ladder until you grab an old to it from the throne and because we're making our way up to Glory so the Jacob's Ladder is God's God's attribute his genes May being made manifest in US in the end of let's turn to John one let's start at verse 43. the day falling Jesus would go forth in the Galilee and find a Phillip and sayeth unto him follow me now Philip was the best Syed of the city of Andrew and Peter Philip findeth Nathaniel and sayeth unto him we have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did right Joseph of Nazareth the son of Joseph Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and Nathaniel said unto him they found the one that the ladder could be anchored to and Nathaniel said unto them can there any good thing come out of matter Philip said unto him come and see Jesus saw the Nathaniel coming to him and saith of him behold an Israelite indeed and whom is no God there's no bitterness at all in it Nathaniel saith unto him once you know it's thou me Jesus answered and said unto him before that Philip called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw the Nathaniel answer that saith unto him grab all Thou Art the Son of God now or the kingdom of evil Jesus answered and said to him but because I said unto thee I saw the end of the Fig Tree believe us now shall see greater things than these and he saith unto him verily verily I say unto you Hereafter ye shall see Heaven open and the angels are ascending and descending upon the son of man now what happened next he said you just paid you you think you've seen something now you're about to see the the manifestation of all the promises of God the attributes of God revealed in me right that's what the son of man is the god revealing himself in man the next thing in chapter two just to sum it up they were looking for uh they ran out of wine and they were looking for they uh they needed some wine for the wedding so Jesus Took water that didn't have any alcohol in it any power in it and he turned it into something the type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost That Could reveal a type of when God's attributes were being familiar with us so that's what this ladder is God revealing that he is a Healer that he is a savior he's a provider and if we make our way up all of these attributes are revealed through us and now even the the secular World tied to Jacob's Ladder with genetics there's a book I found on Amazon called um Jacob's Ladder the human genome the history of the human genome and it's a scientific but it doesn't have anything to do with religion or anything but they're they they know that it has something to do with genes and uh I've heard that a lot of people say well it's uh the Jacob's Ladder is human genetics because I got a picture of what human DNA looks like this is it looks like a ladder yep now if you take human DNA and and try to hook that ladder onto a human you can't hook it on the app you can't hook it onto Jacob you can only hook it on to God right and when God uh if you're if the ladder is hooked onto him and you're on the climbing up the ladder then his attributes can be made manifest in you let's put a book see what brother Reynolds said about genius this uh I've only got five more minutes preach it brother if you got 20 minutes I forgot it was in the class with you uh 1963 it's not managed fast you got tan man all right well I got permission man you got 10 minutes uh this is kind of a long story My Brother Brian was telling the story of a father and mother who wanted to know what was wrong with their boy and uh the 19 1963 of paradox now this is going to take a few minutes to read so your own bear with him for instance a few days ago I was called in on or on a little something going on there was a fine young man very fine boy he was going with a little girl very fine little girl out of a fine family and this boy all of a sudden came up with some kind of an idea and he just walked away he did something wrong to the little girl and what's his promised her to do a certain thing and didn't do it and instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do he it just wasn't in him to do it and the father and mother called me to the scene and said we will desire to know what is wrong with our boy now it's not easy to do sometimes but you must be truthful and honest therefore the boy was a Christian as far as a Believer he had repented and had been baptized and had his position among the Believers but yet had not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit no matter how much he thought he had you thinking you haven't had me is two different things you might be able to try to see you having you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but unless your life is vindicating what you're professing to have you still haven't got it no matter how many emotions how much you jump run Sensations speaking in tongues or shouting or whatever you make might lay it upon which is all right I believe in all that too but unless your life cooks with your testimony then you haven't got it because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells what it is Jesus said by their fruit you shall know that now this young Fella's parents his mother is German no reflection on the German but there is a strain in that family and that is they'll just see it and you can talk to them and they'll just stare you right in the face this girl's sister the mother of this boy her sister I've come down the street many morning and this young lady be sitting out in the yard and I'd say good morning to you she'd just look at me and I'd stop and I'd say sure fine morning she would just stay and look right into an intelligent woman and I'd say come up to see us sometime she just stand and look what her brothers are that way father and mothers that way now the father of the boy is strictly an Irishman Moody and high tempered High Strung that's his whole family like that except one another out of the family converted now in this that boy this father and mother both are Christians fiddle of the Holy Ghost and they have brought this young man up in the way of the Lord and now the young man is about 17 or 18 years old something along their very fine kid and he's been a real model boy at home nice kid and he's got a brother that's just vice versa but the girls the mother's family lives close to a fine church but do you think they'd ever come over there and know and they know it's right but it's just not in them to ask forgiveness or ask pardon me they just won't do it it's just not in them now here's it pay attention now the genes and the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted still remain the flesh that's been integrated after this boy we're not saved by our genes that's right you can't hook that ladder on any one of us right you got to hook it on to the perfect sacrifice therefore the boy has got a complex in him just like from his mother's family and they are not forgiving they will not apologize and that's where that boy stands now I said to the father no matter how much you've raised him up I said now look at you out of here all your family out of all them drunks and fighting and shooting and cutting and so forth now look at your family to the mother there are a bunch of people just sit there and won't speak very independent and so forth irreverent to religion but I said it's not you you're the only one of all your sisters and brothers and you are sweet kind and forgiving what does that in your tree part of that family tree yet you have received the Holy Ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet it's not your people anymore it's not your jeans anymore it's his jeans it's your Christ that lives in you I added that I wasn't reading that I said to them that's okay I said and how moody and high temperature and how strong but you're not you're kind forgiving what is it the Holy Spirit you know more what you are it's Christ in you I said now that same thing has to happen to your son now if you want to look at how genes are your your DNA that ladder is made up of four different uh chemicals or whatever you want to call ATC and G and that controls how you're manifested the different combinations and uh there comes a point in the in the human reproductive system when uh after the the uh egg is is germinated that's sealed off just like when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost it forms a seal around it nothing else can get in to impregnate it with anything else it's sealed off and then a few weeks later something starts happening that scientists can't even figure out those dings there might be a little cell after it started to buy there might be a cell on the outside that all of a sudden the genes flip and it turns into a part of the spinal column those cells are being placed it's like replaced under the body of Christ there's some that are are pastors prophets and teachers there's some that are are deacons and there's some that are just Homemakers and prayer warriors but those genes are flipped on to make us what God wants us to be and to reveal himself enough that's what I believe amen and God has only provided place of worship 1965 and in there he said I chose to put my name at the door of the House of My Worship for my family will be gathered in there under the blood like it was in Egypt anything outside died and in there there's another bread there's no denominational mixture anywhere in my house my children born of my genes amen Lord God my genes are in them I put my word in them at the Rapture in 1965 he said the bride rather is the one that's going to be in the Rapture that alone nothing but the bride the elected ones four known by God from the beginning the father's spiritual genes in 1965 things that are to be he said when the word of God lit our souls and we become Sons and Daughters of God we're the attributes the gene of God in us to be Sons and Daughters of the father God in heaven crying Abba Father my God my God In My Father's House and then we'll uh this is kind of drawing to a close and now we've got to the point where we can see Christ as the anchoring point and if we're in him he manifests himself through us and that's what uh I was getting that last time looking at Matthew Mark Luke and John why is there not a genealogy anymore because a servant doesn't have a genealogy a lot of John doesn't have does it have why John doesn't have a genealogy because God how can you put a genealogy to God Jesus was talking to I think it was Nicodemus he said no man knows where uh if you're born in the spirit where does it come from where is it going right you can't you can't put it on paper but Matthew my King has to have a genealog right Luke son of man has a genealogy and they go in different directions Matthew comes down from Adam because God's coming down to get us and Luke goes back up front two at him I'm sorry I say Matthew comes down from Abraham so he's a promise seed and Luke goes up to Adam the Son of God saying he's taking us back right to where he came from and uh we'll look at that a little bit closer next time oh yeah that's good
