be glad for you to ride along have a good time fellowshipping together okay Hebrews 11 let's talk about Abraham and his journey all right Heavenly Father we thank you this day that you have given us an opportunity to be able to come together to be able to hear because it could be taken from us at any given moment that we would not be able together and that we would not be able to communicate with one another as far as man knows but we know in that hour and time it'll all be taken care of and we're not concerned about it we're just concerned with one thing getting ready against that day so help us Lord to see who we are because only those in that day that have as we've been trying to say for quite a while a positive attitude are going to be able to withstand the enemy in his ways and his doings because we must be programmed to know for shity and you're not left us blind you've given us the truth to be able to walk therein we love you and we thank you Father guide us now as we speak about you and your loving grace in Jesus name amen amen hallelujah Hebrews 11 we'll go verse 1 and two and then we'll go to verse 8-10 now Faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report so what do we doing we are taking the report or the testimony or the witness that they have given that God is real he's a reality he's not an imagination he's not a thought he's an actual substance amen he is the substance okay now let's go to verse eight by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourn in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in the Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city whose Builder City who has foundations whose Builder and maker is God you may be seated Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now still talking about faith substance faith not an imagination or a thought substance Faith a revelation that we can walk in and that will carry us through all right so we were talking about this morning you know we read that Enoch walked with God and we was not because God took him but now we read this morning the Bible says there in Genesis 6 and9 I believe it was was talking about Noah and how that Noah walked with God and I gave some examples down through the Bible of David and the different ones who walked with God because they had a testimony that they pleased him all right and he was pleased to dwell in them all right and then it came down as we use the last part just talking about it that he's pleased to dwell in you he's pleased to honor your word the prophet said what is your decision you know what is your thought what is your decision all right then it's coming to a personal revelation is the point I'm trying to make because those with a personal revelation were the those who had mounted to you know were the ones that amounted to anything in the Bible times those who really had a contact with God who saw God believed God walked with God you know in all of their testimonies all of their report as Paul said here speaks of Hebrews 138 and no matter what age what time what we are he's the same yesterday today and forever now we come up to Abraham and you know I hope you listened if you hadn't heard it message Wade brought the other Wednesday on Abraham and I thought it was a a wonderful message how that he started out as Abram right and made his journey into the name of Abraham and that's what we were doing last night a little bit in the Bible study we had a real good time at least I did of talking about these things and uh you know and looking at Abram a r a m Abram and his name was changed to Abraham so he actually what did he add he added an ha and brother R said he gave him part of his name you go back in their languages to where they are and it turned out to be Elohim like hiim and see then that would compare with Elohim see it's not a not Elohim you know is Elohim all right and then he received part of his name but not to just say the name starts off with ha you know it's meaning giving him part of the revelation of himself into him for the time all right he gave him a name change that name change fit right into do it we're supposed to have had a name change we're Christian all right so then that gives us part to do with it but now Abram in his journey from there to Abraham he met his way was bringing out he met God many times he met melz when his name was still Abram but then he finally become Abraham and that way it was fitting in in the correct order as to the time and the part all right but now I want you to think about just a little part I want to bring out it says here in Hebrews that Abraham was called to go out you know he got up and left he didn't know where he was going he was just told to get up and leave but he was going and even though he didn't know where he was going I'm sure that Abraham realized that something was going on and that's what I wish we could see that if God is concerned enough to you and I to give us the word now little personal right okay give us the word here in Lula that's not like average places of just going to church and being good and claiming to believe the message and and all of the things and not knowing what's going on but he has given us an opportunity to be able to hear amen well why would it say about Abraham that he was called to go out into a place that what them which you should actually receive for an inheritance all right and he went out not knowing whether he went we deal a lot with not knowing whether he went you know we we emphasize that but just remember he believed he was going somewhere and where he was going was his rightful inheritance right right now take time sometime to read the uh life story the things of Abram there in the scripture and Abraham and uh notice where he went cuz remember if you go back there and read it he says wherever you set the soul of your foot I'll give it to you you know that's really something now he was down in the earth childes as we get to in a little bit he was Gentile and a heathen right and yet God called him and said I'll give you everywhere he didn't say I'll give you Jerusalem I'll give you Canan I'll give you this he said I'll give you everywhere first step Footprints means possession right first step you take going give it to you and everywhere you walk I'll give you that land for an inheritance because that was what he was saying follow the Journey of Abraham just read it he goes here he goes here he goes all the way through Canaan read it it wasn't when Israel crossed over and went over you know into he went all over Canaan traveled he went down into Egypt he went into all the countries you know places where he tried to give Sarah away and all of the bad that was taking place God said I'll give you wherever you set your foot now we're going to get to it in a minute so keep this in mind and remember Abraham is the father of us all we say well it's only only the faith seed that's good because that's where it comes down to but remember even the Gentiles as we call it through Hagar come from Abraham Abram if you want to call it to keep it technical some things so he's the father of us all and that's wonderful but get to Point everywhere you set your foot so he told him go out into a place which he said I to receive for an inheritance obeyed he went out not knowing where he was going He travel he got in trouble he'd go this way he'd go that way things would happen he he would go turn his journey but my point is if you'd look at it on a map and you got Abram as his name was then he's all over Canaan was that not the country or the part that Joshua was to lead him across to he walked down through Jerusalem right see when Joshua and them went over they were just going over to take possession but where Abraham had walked because it was a natural thing but now what I want you to think about in today is to watch Abraham in the natural yeah but watch it becomes more into the spiritual all right and you'll see that what I'm trying to bring that Abel by Revelation spoke of the coming Messiah Enoch walked off of the Earth by believing Hebrews 13:8 Noah has his part and Builds an ark and basically all of that was related to them personal right you understand Abel offered a sacrifice Enoch was not because God took him it just by itself see Noah comes along it picks up that he's got his wife and all of the kids but when you come to Abraham you begin to look at things that you know turning more from natural to spiritual all right now because everywhere you set your foot I'll give it to you as an inheritance and that was Palestine that was uh Jerusalem that was Canaan land he goes into Egypt he goes everywhere that's right he starts out as a child e whoever where you're at it's not just making him the heir of Jerusalem are you following me trying to get a little natural something you look at so it's not just that he says I'll give you Jerusalem I'll give you Bethlehem or something like that it's the place look at the inheritance of Abraham and you'll see his descendants are living in those places that more no no matter what we call them today you got the isites coming down and they're over right right now fighting over Jerusalem but you know that hasn't broke one promise God did give them the land of Canaan right a natural land but there was more to the story than Abraham and just a natural part as we'll cover that in a minute that would make us Romans 8 and 28 and 29 what no last words a Jew Jew would make him as the scripture would say in Romans 4 and 16 that Abraham who is the father of us all now Paul knew of a coming promised things but he wasn't just dealing with that he knew that God had kept his promise and no matter at the time that Paul was standing there that natural Israel was in bondage to the Romans they were still the conquerors the Romans were the squatters that all belonged to Israel all of that country over there right now see they're making them give up this making them give up that if they draw the biblical lines of the promise to through Abraham America would be flooded with people because if they took everybody out that was not you supposed to be there get what I'm saying the whole part of that country whether it be Egypt whether it be Canaan whether it be the Earth childes whatever it be it all belongs to the Seed of Abraham M and right today the Seed of Abraham inhabits that because the Seed of Abraham through ishma coming on one side of it the Seed of Abraham through Isaac coming on the other all right you could spend the rest of the day talking about how sure the promises of God when I was over there we were there and Reuben said Sam Pray for Peace I said will we pray Pray for Peace Ruben but don't give up one inch of ground that you're holding do they want to force them to give up all of this and they're gradually taking away the biblical promise right still right today that we witness those things all right but see that's not all the story that's just showing that he's the father of the Jew he's the father of the Gentiles he's the father of us all that's right now we'll get back to that in a minute but listen it's not a Jew that's a Jew outward I mean excuse me it's fleshly yeah it's a Jew that's a Jew inwardly is that the words of Paul Paul said all Israel would be saved he didn't say all Jews would be saved but all Israel would be saved right now that makes a great thing to think about because Abraham now Abram if you want to start off with it whatever had he been a Jew making a little point we were talking about this last night the Bible study had Abraham been a Jew then everybody have to be a Jew right are you with me so Paul knew that all Israel were not Jews in the bases of their name they were 12 tribes of Israel Jews only signifies the tribe of Judah and one other there are you for familiar with your Bible if you ain't read your Bible I you know I love to read those things don't you yes we were looking it up last night because I didn't have the notes or anything the first time the word Jew is mentioned is in the Book of Esther it talks about Mori being a Jew but the first time the word Jews J WS is mentioned is in Second Kings it's referring to the tribe of Judah because at that time a division had been made in Israel that 12 tribes were over here two tribes were over here all right now the two tribes which Judah would have been the head of that part was in when into captivity as they did they were called Jews because of coming from Judah but we want to say well Abraham's a Jew no Abraham was a gentile right that's why he could be the father of us all just a little natural part Abraham being a gentile do you want that Jews let's see what let's let's go to go ahead with number three brother and we'll pick it up the communion where it says Abraham was a gentile the word Jew was not even in effect fact the people in Bible times had one name right Joseph but to distinguish that it would say Joseph of armea why because there was a whole lot of Joseph's and see the word Abraham he was called a Hebrew Abraham was called a Hebrew all right the word Hebrew means one from the other side of the river go back to you concordes look it up in other words a man was standing there looking and Abram Abraham or which way you want to go he walks across the river and the man says who are you he Saidi Abraham he said oh you are from the other side of the river and said thereby I'll call you a Hebrew you see that would develop into a name to be brought all the way through if you're a Hebrew okay see that would have brought the name into being of Hebrew Okay Abraham you're a Hebrew but go back in your Bible they was looking it up last night and you know what it says about Abraham that I brought your father Abraham from the other side of the flood who remember that from last night because I didn't really intend to go this way but Joshua I guess I brought your father Abraham from the other side of the flood if you don't believe in predestination you're getting vastly messed up he brought him from the other side of the flood the Big River okay Hebrew the other side of the river and he come down to be called a Hebrew see those names develop because of do it so the name Jew developed because of the tribe of Judah that went into captivity all right go ahead brother we'll put these up and read just a little just bypass go to number five should be enough for our understanding which is questions and answers 63 paragraph 120 now yes these Jews are not not all the Jews will be saved you remember the point there Paul said all Israel will be saved he didn't say all Jews would be saved that's what is it I got it somewhere in here where it said all Israel all right not all the Jews will be saved they'll not be saved only those who when he's speaking of a Jew Jew just is a name that was given to them after they left I believe Nebuchadnezzar over began to call them Jews first because the tribe of Judah was taken then and given a name of Jew and because they came down from Judah and that got the name of Jew but now Israel is different Israel and Jew is all together different not all Jews will be saved but all Israel Paul said will be saved all right because it's not every natural Jew look at Paul I mean look at right around every Jew isn't an Israelite it only distinguishes the tribe of Judah that's why the word Jew was picked up because of the tribe of Judah all right and they called him Jud Jews all right but then Paul never said all Jews will be saved he said all Israel to be saved why Israel's name that's the name of the of redemption of all the way back and all Israel will be saved but not all Judah Judaism will be saved it's not all Israel not meaning all 12 tribes Israel is the chosen of God all right but now my point of what I'm getting to Abraham was a gentile well that would put coming from him Judah which would be the Jews but coming from him was through Hagar was the ishmaelites which is you and I right no we would never would oh get off of it we're Gentiles we're in a gentile dispensation are we wouldn't be having any hope so Abraham is a father of us all you know that those ishmaelites over there they blow that trumpet every day you hear them on the loudspeakers and the thing going through and they hollering out Allah H holla and Abraham Our Father know that's who they are all right but see it's not all Israel I mean not all Jews it's all Israel all Israel will be saved that's God's chosen out of all the 12 tribes he's not going to choose a certain tribe no that was the Jew coming down it's all Israel all of the true Seed of Abraham that come through Isaac will be the saved of the Israel but yet he started his journey as a gentile which would bring you and I into the situation amen that's the whole of Paul's explaining when he said for he is not a Jew Romans too he is not a Jew which is one outwardly neither he is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a Jew which is in one inwardly and circumcision is of the heart in the spirit not in the letter now listen Abraham a gentile makes him the father of us all Jews come along in Judah which would make this the word Jew and we look over our now we say them all them Jews they're not all Jews they're not all from the tribe of Judah but they're all Israelites whether they be Judah or Benjamin or who are Abraham is a father of us all then take that now and remember that he's the promised seed that you're talking about and the promised seed would be the spiritual right so he's the father of the seed of Faith or faith seed if you want to call it and from that there would come Jesus Christ to bring Redemption to the Seed of Abraham I'm happy and Paul was happy brother R said one day Paul was happy to be able to place himself into the lineage of Abraham not as a Jew he says that was automatic Paul was a Jew right he was an Israelite let's put it make it correct he might not have been a Judah but you see that's where you can't keep all of your natural lineages running right Jesus come out of the tribe of Judah physically speaking coming down all right would you know that Judas coming out of the same tribe Judas came from the same tribe that Jesus came from see that's one thing the Jews could never comprehend as Paul trying to explain a messiah I was saying last night to the people he was trying to explain the Messiah and they said well which one's he come from said won't he come from Levi and Paul says no his was not to come from Levi it look L like the Messiah should have come through the tribe of Levi right because being the high priest but he was not he came from Judah because it was promised to Judah a lawgiver shall come from Judah and we can't get it to run straight in the natural lineages all right just just giving you a little thought see then Abraham becomes a father of us all not by physical lineage but by spiritual Revelation right amen Abraham is my father by spiritual Revelation not not genetic makeup right why because from the tribe of Judah would come the Lord Jesus Christ and Judah come from Abraham but it was the promise to Abraham remember where we started off I'll give you everywhere you set your soully feet that got the land that got the countries that got all of the places that he ever walked walked but he wasn't concerned with that now think with me you know if you got a promise from God if you had really a promise no brother dick there he's about is it 80 something now or 70 something what is it 77 but he's 77 78 okay but you remember a man in the Bible one time he he got a promise from God because he prayed he said Lord I don't want to die till I see the coming Messiah and he says you won't pass until you see that right he goes around and tell everybody I'm not going to pass until I see the Messiah everybody keeps looking at him boy I better hurry up you better hurry up now you done 80 90 whatever my point is one thing if God gives you a promise there is no way it can be broken except what you do right brother was telling me a great promise that God made with him and I said brother there's nobody can break that promise but you but I said you can break that promise because you can do wrong and it breaks the promises of God he don't have to do it all right but here comes brother dick 78 God Appears to him one day and everybody's saying well we're in the last days and in the last days and he comes along and he says well you know the Lord showed me that I'm going to live 10 more years well if that's God telling you you know how long he's going to live 10 more years I don't care what you think I don't care what he would look like at the end of it right he's still going to live that long you follow me God promised Abraham the land he got it it is the full inheritance under the Jews as we call them the Israelites and there's no way they can take it away from them they can burn it they can blow it to Pieces but they'll never annihilate the promise of God all right so now as we're going from a natural thing with Noah Abel Enoch was more or less natural dealing with them would you are you following me yes now we come to Abraham and it connects together with all of everything salvation comes in as to be the Seed of Abraham by faith all right and the promises of God like I've always said God anointed David to be king right there was no way he was ever going to die that's right I don't care if he met a Goliath every day or 10 goliaths every day or what he met he was not going to die until he sat on the throne he didn't say how long you'd be sitting on it but he did Say it'll be for your Generations now see it's God's promise now it's kind of odd the way Paul writes of Abraham what he talking about let's read it again by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place natural Canaan which you should I receive for an inheritance obeyed and went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in a Land Of Promise all over Egypt all over as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles are tents and things you know this going along with Isaac and with Jacob he lived long enough to see them too into the point ARs with him of the same promise whatever promise was given to Abraham was given to Isaac was given to Jacob so they got where they set their foot all right what I like is the next verse which is a very odd situation now that's what I want you to look at a very odd situation comes into being that Abraham is Promised the land he's looking for a land he's looking for a place to settle down right to put his foot and say I'm at home he walks all over Canaan in his journey read it Isaac and Jacob and him traveling with him as he Journeys but he never is to Anchor his feet come on because Canaan belongs to the Canaanites until Joshua crossed the land and then Canaan became as we call it the promised land right so Abraham never had a natur natural City but he had a longing in his heart you have a city what kind of a city was that naturally he would look and think in his mind and he'd see the beauties of some of the countries around him and he said one of these days we are going to have a land of our own we're going to dwell in that land problems may come in heartaches and troubles and said we're going to have a land and they did Joshua finally crossed and when they went into Canaan their problem was was they didn't kill all the Canaanites always our problem we want to destroy just enough to live and look like a Christian but we just leave one little old Canaanite and we keep him covered up you know all right you see where you could stay on things a long time but but you know the natural Jew they lost that country because of their sin because that little old Canaanite that they didn't destroy read your Bible they went in and they come to complete rest of adoption we can type all that all that goes with it it goes in wonderful situations or what you're typing for for the time but they never got rid of all the Canan they should have went in there and slaughtered every one of them they would have had no trouble but you wouldn't have a Bible being in complete because it' already spoke and told what would happen so natural Israel was a nation under Joshua and the leadership coming on down from their own but then because of sin in the camp as had done before before they lost that country but a promise was made that the Jews the Israelites we'd call it that Israel would come forth again as a nation no other nation in the world has ever come back from Oblivion right you know being destroyed the Jewish flag is the only flag that's ever rose up again after that nation was destroyed cuz that's what they do with it you ought to go over there and look like Jerusalem been destroyed I forgot how many times and they just when they destroy it they just come in and build on the top of it they just pile up sand and pile up rocks and and just get right on top of that cuz that's the Conquering power youve got underneath you your enemy's dead that's why they built on top of them to destroy to show that it was destroyed but you know God promised Israel to be a nation in the 40s you started a war and in that war they come back to a place that Allen be was coming into those as we'd call them Arabs just for a word and Allenby was coming in and you know they captured Jerusalem without firing a shot you know why because Allenby was the General and they went in telling everybody that Allah was coming well they took Alan be and translated it to Allah and then people throw down everything they not to fire shot to capture Jerusalem because it was a promise in God's word but you see Israel now as a nation a nation okay showing that God would keep his promise to Abraham but you see Abraham had something else that's why I like to read go ahead and pull that back up bro on Hebrews by faith he journeyed in the land of promise is in a strange country buing Tabernacle with Isaac and Jacob the HS with him with the same promise for he look for a city once which has foundations we know we look for natural City you know what they got a natural City but look what Paul was really I mean Paul was explaining what was in the mind of Abraham for he looked for a city which has Foundation whose Builder and maker is God and more than just looking at a natural country to live in maybe Abraham didn't understand that fully but he had a revelation remember that Enoch Abel Noah Abraham a revelation as I said about Noah he had a revelation that Enoch was gone and his son Methuselah was 969 years old and died he died the same year of the flood right in the a year or something or a flood see you knew what was the definition with thla his name means one who died before the flood we put it so Noah knew something was going to take place he believed the revelation of Enoch that I was bringing this morning and he believed building an ark was his job and he saw that Enoch was gone in other words it finally doned on him as I said this morning and hey the story of Enoch is that Enoch went around telling everybody that he wasn't going to die he was going to walk off the earth and he says you know what I believe the old boy did I got a revelation I better get to working on the ark and better get inside because his son means that he's withus and he was not going to go through the flood so it's close I got a revelation Abraham when he was given the promise to go to a land that I'll tell you of however it states it there just get up and leave and all of that walk of Abraham it gets to build in a little more stronger and it get a little bit more thinking about it and he sees how that he met God he sees he got a name changed he seemed that they goofed up with s with Hagar but still part of that land he said okay things are building up you know I'm beginning to realize and maybe the place I'm looking for is not here on Earth are you listening maybe he begins to realize that if God would keep him from giving away his wife if God would go out and Conquer a nation it's because he goes and gets his backsliding kin folks lot and no enemy can stand before him and all he's got just the house soul of slaves as we' call some of them and just people living in wouldn't Warriors he goes out and defeats nations with them Abraham begins to think that maybe this ain't all As Natural as I think you know I'm really not concerned he would say with where I want to build this city that I believe we going to build maybe God is bringing into view a more Heavenly thing because evidently Paul is expressing the thoughts of Abraham right and he says that Paul that Abraham says for he looked for a city which has foundations whose Builder and maker is God that was not walls and buildings in Jerusalem now do you realize that the future home that we speak of come on the future home that we speak of the prior to that is a millennial reign which the the land is supposed to cleave and and up comes a mountain and the Millennium is on and you know what the Millennium is to the Jews the Israelites it's not for you and I we just there on a honeymoon right it's to Israel let's just read what brother R said go ahead brother and pull up questions and answers number six 1964 8:23 the evening and remember God the creator that created heavens and earth is in glory right now preparing that City Abraham looked for it and you're going to have to take a two-fold thing to think of what I'm talking about the Millennium is to Israel that is not the future home right but in the in Israel to the Millennium will be even a temple built not to offer animal sacrifice I say no but a temple will be built in the Millennium to the Jews look what Abraham was seeing and remember the creator that created the heavens and the Earth is in glory right now preparing that City Abraham looked for it he left his home he separated everything that was dear to him and looking for what for why now why was he looking for now look what he's saying follow this point look he was a prophet shake your and get the point listen he was a prophet and being a prophet he was connected with the spirit and part of the spirit you talking about Abraham are you reading Abraham being a prophet and being a prophet he was connected with the spirit and part of the spirit and something told him within him there is a city he started looking for it said I'm a pilgrim a stranger I'm looking for a city whose Builder and maker is God he knowed that city was somewhere oh my and I believe that right on the grounds where he looked for it right there in Palestine there's where it'll raise up where it's on Mount Zion there's where she'll be brother it said Abraham after a while begins to realize that this is not all just a literal City that he's looking for in the Millennium it will be to Israel as a nation and there will be a temple there will be beautiful things made that's in the Millennium that's to Israel that's Abraham's promise that's his City now listen Abraham's promise was a city but then when it went from Abraham's promise it went to the bride of Christ which is the seed of Abraham now let's read our part okay look at the next one paragraph 337 the invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ 65 11:25 dear God we set solemnly now a Thanksgiving Day it really is Lord I'm Grateful Lord to be living in this day this is the greatest day Paul the Apostle long to see this day the Great Men of old long to see it and remember he said on the quote before then Abraham had that Spirit of prophet they look for this day Abraham looked for this day he sought for a city whose Builder and maker was God it hangs right above us all right things right above us tonight John seen in the spirit God descending Out of Heaven bore record know that that was the son of God and think now he's choosing his bride the Millennium is to Israel and they will have a city to fulfill the promise to Abraham of a literal part that he never got to partake of yet he journeyed through the land and right up there in Canaan land right around Jerusalem in the Millennium is going to push up a mountain all right be a beautiful place a temple will we built I said not for animal sacrifices no but to explain Jesus Christ we're going to be there on the honeymoon you know what we're going to be doing preaching to the Jews to tell them about Jesus Christ right we're going to be telling them we're going to be able to tell those things you know what I love before then there's going to be a marriage supper before we go to the Millennium you know who's going to be at that marriage supper we're going to sit down at the welcome table with Abraham Isaac and Jacob is that what it says when we read it over here that he so journeyed with Abraham Abraham so Journey with Isaac and Jacob see when you go to the marriage supper there's going to be some welcome guests there they will not even be part of the Bride but will be welcome guest which is Abraham Isaac and Jacob or brother Tatum every time he testified he always said we'll sit down at the welcome table with Abraham Isaac and Jacob do you see the whole story do you need it again and Abraham was looking for a natural City that he would have upon Earth he begins to realized that it wouldn't exactly that way and he sees because he's a prophet and he's in the spirit of the prophets and he sees on that there's something else going to happen but that one day they will be and he saw the Jews coming into cap coming into power but then losing their power going into captivity because of their wrongdoings but in the end time that they would come back and they would inhabit the land of Jerusalem but didn't knew it meant more remember it was the spirit of Prophecy in Abel it said it was blood it was a spirit of Prophecy in Enoch that said he wouldn't die it was Spirit of Prophecy in Noah that built an ark now we see the spirit of Prophecy in Abraham and Abraham knows what's going to take place he says to his wife one day he says now that King's going to kill me cuz you're beautiful I believe she was a beautiful natural I do because actually you get up to be 90 years old before the change came I believe she was a beautiful woman you know I do I believe up to her 90 years of age she was still beautiful but he said oh said we went through a lot of problems honey said you going with that King he said God's going to take care of it because if I've got the promise he can't touch you you want the quote from the prophet that he couldn't touch her he couldn't touch Sarah that King couldn't do it there was no way I don't care what he was doing he couldn't touch him touch her maybe he knew a little bit more than we think he said Sarah save my neck go with him cuz God's going to take care of you you know s is pretty voluntarily I don't think most of your women today would want to you know if I just come in and told Peggy Saidi want you to go live with this guy down here because he said he's going to kill me if you don't he'd probably say well you better go get ready to die because I'm not going to do that but Sarah just goes along with it you so that was a submissive of that day uh could I remind you that sah was a hotheaded like Noah's I mean like Moses wife was a hot-headed woman sah was a sh a conniving deceiver it's like I was talking to Sister Barbara I say this and quit talking to Sister Barbara about the people of the women of ish I mean the mamad and or what you want to call them she's telling me how they was under subjection I said hey look don't tell me I said they they're under subjection because they want to you know they don't want to cause no trouble I said women are women I don't care what nice and ality they are African Hindus whatever they're smart I said don't you remember sitting around the table she's gred I said you sit around the table you hear your stories don't you them women is telling each other how to connive that old man they just look like they're under subjection they want the husband to think they're under subjection women are women I don't care where they come from right come on but I hope you've got the story of what I'm trying to bring and put together what way we're going to get back to Abraham in a little bit you know later because we're going to go through Sarah and then it drops back to Abraham but I hope you understand the story Abraham finally catches on by revelation of what's going on he said someday I'll be in that City someday I'll walk the streets of that City and if he's going to be a welcome table you know we us at the welcome table if he's going to be in the Millennium he's going to be in that City natural that'll be built but then one day there'll be a future home that comes down because the Earth will push up one more time and it'll be a mountain and the future home will come down Abraham will be able to walk in that real City that his seed of Faith would be there that he would not be a part of physically speaking and would not be a part of spiritually speaking but he'll be a welcome guest whole lot to think about right all of them by faith Abel Enoch Noah Abraham by Faith by Revelation they live their lives out for you and I they saw the coming Messiah now if Abraham saw the city you already knew the God right he met Mel jezdic he met God and his name changed where he' be a a part of the name of God these Warriors of faith has already made a good report now this is my last wording all of the illustrations of Dick being 78 promis 10 years you can't stop it until that 10 years is done right if it's a promise of God you know what he promised to have a bride in the last days and you know what he's going to have one that's right you know what he's going to have to go out in the highways and the hedges that's scripture brother around said first pull second pull he said third pul he go out in highways and hedges and compel them to come in and the Bible says get the good and the bad read your Bible you don't just stop on one illustration of that read it on until you hear him say get the good and the bad through the opening of the word in the lik that days look what the garbage cans he's picked up that you're looking at standing in front of you and I'm looking at in front of me the garbage cans that realize we're not worth nothing and realize if there's anything good in US is because of the promise of almighty God because our righteousness is filthy rags in his sight but he promised it stand ready for the communion think on these things remember brother Quinn next Sunday I'm sure there'll be many more that will come to a time this day is a word that they'll be coming through to minister for us we do the best we can you know what I mean scheduling and trying to line up the ones that we desire to come and be with us and just pray that we make the right choices right do we come to the communion part it's promised one of these days this won't be it's so natural as we do today remember the marriage supper is the communion we're not going to have beans and ters and steaks at the marriage supper and be the communion fulfill all of this for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembrance of me after the same manner also we took the cup which he had s when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do you the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the W of the Lord unworthily she'll be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup or he that eateth and drinketh on unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body is what we were talking about last night the body of the Lord the bride of Christ for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep where we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come let's just have a few moments of Silent prayer praying one for the other for the Lord to open his word to us and to reveal to us who we are and what we're doing here and our purpose our point of what we're doing and our message in the day we're living Lord Jesus we love you we thank you you made many promises to many individuals you promis one thing that they to us that we would find our place and realize who we are and in that we would walk in the light of your love we desire that you cover our sins and cleanse us because we know we're not nothing but Sinners saved by grace but yet you chose us as you chose Abraham in the natural you've chosen Us in the spiritual and Lord we just ask you to help us and guide us as we come to this time of communion we ask you to give us the right understanding that we may walk in your loving grace forgive our sins and Lord just cleanse us of all things and Let It Be You Lord that would sanctify and make us worthy as we take just a moment of Silent prayer then praying one for the other we ask you to have the preeminence in each one of us father we ask you to just have your way with all of us guide us now in Jesus name the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread it's been made for this purpose today and as we come to the time of partaking we ask that you would reveal unto us that this is a symbol of your word that went forth and that it's not a physical thing that it's spiritual that we do physical yeah we see the spiritual sanctify this bread to our partakers as we all partake of it Lord and we ask you to just cleanse it our being Lord because within this little bit of piece of bread we could take could be death if Satan could in any way inject what he could into it but yet we ask you to sanctify it and cleanse it because it speaks of your word have your way in Jesus name we should even thank God for every drink of water we get everything that we do because Satan in this day is doing everything he can in every way that he can to try to destroy us but yet he can't do it just as we talking about Abraham that he didn't worry about Sarah he said well that old boy's got a lot of problem cuz he's going to have to deal with God you know if he tries to touch you he's going to be dealing with God you know we can call him a coward and I do because of his doings and ways but yet he might not have been as much as we think he might have been knowing exactly that God was going to come on the scene to do it and to make it manifest in the right way right father we just thank you for this wine Lord It's a symbol of your blood which you shed for each one of us as as we eat the little piece of bread and we drink this little bit of wine tomorrow it will be blood cells in our body that we may be able to grow thereby and the blood Lord is a purative so this wine could be a very purative that we would need into our bodies we'd ask you to just sanctify it and the partakers now in the name of Jesus Christ amen come morning I walk by the river I'll rest me the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and and it gives me the strength to go on come morning I'll walk by the river I'll rest near the Ever Green Tree I care my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me you never know how God does things but he's going to make it all work for his honor and Glory he speaks to the children of Israel that when they got out and started if they had a known as we would call it to paraphrase it if they had have known what it was going to be like in their Journey they would have prob probably wanted to stay with the garlics and the cucumbers in the Egypt and the bondage cuz they actually got on to Moses about it and said that you know you would have left us alone we at least had the garlics and the cucumbers and he got us out here now we ain't got nothing oh God comes down and gives them quail and gives them Mana you know CU you know what if God promised you something don't worry about it only thing you're going to do is get in the we they committed to God and said Lord that's mine and I I've told you maybe it shouldn't have been told you but I I know what a gift is and I know how it works and I've always told you right when something is being revealed to you you know when it's revealed it's made known to you he didn't just raise your hands and say thank you Lord thank you Lord for my family for my children thank you Lord that's maybe shouldn't have been explained to you but it is a secret that I've known for a long time claim your family in the time that God is revealing his word to you and see if it won't work you're in atmosphere you're in a place you're in a realm of the eternities will not talk to him not talk to him at that time I'll protect again you can be seated one get everything ready read from John 13 supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas his car Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a bason and begin to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel where withth he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou has no part with me Simon Peter Sith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said to him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every with and you're clean but not all you know a lot of people argue over where Judas was still in the upper room well if Judas wasn't in the upper room then Jesus was talking about somebody else being a bad egg right I mean there's arguments among the people of the message whether Judas was in the upper room or not at the time well if he wasn't then when it says here but ever and you are clean but not all so there was some more that wouldn't right that maybe they needed to leave listen or you knew who should betray him therefore said he you're not all clean so he knew who's going to betray so after he washed their feet and had given his taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what I've done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I've have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happier are ye if you do them let's Stand Together Heavenly Father we've come to this part of the service the sisters being dismissed to go downstairs and now the foot washing it was at this place that Satan really did enter there in into Judas and he went out Lord just help us a realize realization and thank you for your word and your love Your Grace Thank You For You Lord we ask you now that you would just go with us go with the sisters as naturally they go out of the foot wash and then take care of everybody on the way home give a safe journey Lord let your love be with us people Brother Dean traveling back from his brother there and just be with these that are sick we pray that you would reach down into their hearts and their lives and cleanse their bodies that they may walk upright in you we love you and we thank you you in Jesus name amen you dis Miss
