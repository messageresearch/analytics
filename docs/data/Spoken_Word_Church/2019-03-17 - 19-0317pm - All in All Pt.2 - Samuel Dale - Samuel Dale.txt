just touch and and guide us into your grace we love you and we thank you and we commit everything to you now in Jesus name Amen Russians three verse nine why not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither now in him was not there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision uncircumcision barbarian Cynthia never how you pronounce those words there bond nor free the Christ is all and in all Christ is all and in all okay now let's go to Corinthians 15 we'll begin to verse 20 but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead whereas as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive every man in his own order Christ the firstfruits afterward they that are Christ's at his coming now I want you to think about all and in all I want you to think about that he's describing here the whole situation because he describes Christ Adam you know now he's describing never a man after his own order Christ the firstfruits afterward they that it that is coming then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death for he hath put all things under his feet but when he set all things were put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto Him then she oldest son also becomes subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all you may be seated the Lord of his and his blessing to the reading of the word now we tried to do this morning you know cause of company drop back but we didn't drop it far back now as we you maybe would think because we were trying to make sure you follow the line up and follow the importance of what is being said so we were covering the end that the prophet said God came in three sons named son of man son of God son of David all right now three sons names now that doesn't mean that we believe in many gods all right it's just one true and living God correct all right now also it doesn't mean that we are you know trying to go and bring any thought adding to the point of what is saying because it's three sons now God has many manifestations right whatever manifestation now listen ever manifestation that God has will fall under one of those manifestations of the three sons all right Son of Man will cover the bases of the prophets all of the things that's in there we've tried not to extend out into great length is maybe you think I try to do I I try to cut back and maybe I need to but you know you could spend months preaching from the Old Testament of son of man and then get into the New Testament and how this verse after verse I asked you if you would to just read Matthew Mark Luke and John and notice the things that it spoke of constantly of son of man you know the son of mensis or the seed the son of man that is so Amanda that the whole thing is relation to that point all right then you know like I said it all would be covered under son of man son of God you could preach off of that we have about who he is and what happened and what's taking place and the different things all right - son of David for the millennial reign to fulfill the the scriptures are promised to David you know that his son which in the natural was Solomon said on his throne but that was not the son that he was speaking of it was Jesus Christ to set in the millennial reign alright so we spent you know time this morning trying to pick that up a little to make sure you follow the example we're talking about all right now see then it's very vital to understand as I said all manifestations will fall under one of those three examples son of man son of God son of David all right now it will cover many things now God has many ways revealing himself now he has three it was said three sons names but he comes in three or he comes in four titles right he comes in four titles and you take C and bring it in and you bring in son of Abraham I'll get to that in a minute and the message and you place him within and then brother branham gives you which one of which is what it is and who that is error the earth which is the son of God alright now because he has many titles at least those four that we would list he has many manifestations so keep that in your your mind and you won't get try to limit to a point of stopping somewhere alright you may not think it's important to understand but I've given you the example over and over to try to make that clear that how are you going to go from one manifestation to another the it was necessary not that then he come to Holy Ghost in the Old Testament it was necessary to come as son of man and then it when you would come in to the Matthew Mark Luke and John it would do that with son of man who'd eventually out of son of man I am alright then you would go from dire to - by him giving his life then he could come on the baptism of the Holy Ghost from there Pentecost to be son of God okay now everybody following that thought because that spirit God are the new birth now you're going to son of a son of God through the ages the next step in the three sons names would go to son of David in the Millennium so you're changing totally from the Gentile dispensation over to the Jewish dispensation or time so you're going to pick up a well how are you going to go from son of God the Son of David I've asked that point it may not be in vital to you but it's very vital to me to be able to tie together all the scriptures because you've got to keep them in correct line but it doesn't mean maybe that much did you but I remember i illustrate it like this when you're talking about the coming of God so you got many manifestations in the coming of God he comes for his bride he come come to redeem him he come to her to get his bride he comes with his bride he comes to the Jews in the Millennium you know in the tribulation then he comes to the with the Jews in the Millennium so there's five things that you're talking about the coming of the Lord now it's very vital to make sure those scriptures don't cross each other because what if you're using a scripture that applies to the coming of God to the Jews yet you read you a scripture of where he's coming to the Gentiles you know the bride or you know with the brown Hornet see you're totally out of the word that's what I said that may not mean anything to you but I believe it did to the Prophet and it does to me to be able to keep things in line and then you say without risks brother Dale tell me what to the screw well I have to sit down and look on that for quite a while to be able to catch up which way it's going but it will a line of then each one has its meaning and ways of expressing itself all right so then to me it's very vital to understand because listen you understand what I'm saying you go from son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got to have between Dyer and go into Israel look you know the Millennium look what you got a high/low look what you'd be this just what do you need your son of God down to the church ages and then you'd miss the rapture you know the saying you wind up in the Millennium you know bad supper you get all of those things and you'd wind up in the Millennium huh and so you wouldn't understand how you get tired go ride so how do you get dark so all right so the Prophet when he brought it I've read it over and over to you off of the unveiling of God to where he would be using the sort of God a son of man son of God he said in between this he comes back that son of man all right now son of man is in relationship to the rapture changing the body all of the things to getting us prepared far as the future home are you following me please so look what you'd be missing but by taking the Prophet and letting him wedge it in it's not an addition to what he's saying because I said everything is covered either son of man son of God son of David all right so now we've got it lined up to what son of man prophet coming to Israel coming down in Jesus Christ giving his life etc son of God seven churches you right in the end town just in the last days this age he comes back as son of man for just a little while the Prophet said and look what it does then it comes to bring in the Prophet and his message and all he's bringing in relation to the son of man then you can go to the son of David till you see that away you've got something to carry you from one stage to the next stage to the next stage all right so now if everybody got that in line to where we could at least mentally you would understand me as to what I'm saying without that son of man I don't want to use the word injected but brother Ron said returns that was his way of saying it returned here between this what between the Son of God and son of David God returns at son of man to bring us this message in the end time and to bring us to a change of the body bring us to a rapture all right and put us into the Millennium it's this message who puts a star in other words read run says whatever puts the bra I'll push the Israel in the Millennium you know we'll put the bride in the Millennium alright what is that the opening of the word so what will Israel do now watch the point when they receive Christ after we leave they will see those two prophets son of man all right not the prophets is no come on we we got it right we can follow it but he'll see God dealing through those two prophets then they'll say that God died understand but it Reynolds says questions and answers silver he said they'll see and they'll realize they missed it all right through those two prophets standing there and and revealing and knowing where they're standing then they will then see Christ as it supposed to be they pull up for wheat for days to fulfill the scripture and as they do then he comes to them now listen he comes to Israel as son of God are you following me the baptism with the Holy Ghost they get the baptism with the Holy Ghost 144,000 does not make them bride make some servants but they get eternal life here right now are you following it so look at the perfection see of the way the Prophet would bring it see then they get the two witnesses son of man they see through that that they need they've killed their Messiah and then they say that we've already received Christ and gone and they see their hopes is resting in that son of God to them all right see then they'll go to seeing that in this age in this age the bride would come back to being the son of man no we've been over that and over that trying to get you see it so see Israel's gonna get it what God I mean son of man son of God son of man something David you're not adding one thing to it because everything is involved in the three sons names so they get it it's the same way we get it they get eternal life here right and under that eternal life to them two witnesses and the ministering they come to a basis of seeing of what really happened and how the son of man is entire as so interlace into everything until it will bring them to work they will walk off the earth right and then they'll go to the Millennium that's on a day you know this son of David they'll be there as eunuchs to the bride so watch the same plan for Israel plans for the bride what puts them there puts us down all right so you're following what I'm saying now it's not saying what brother Dale's trying to add another work in there no three sons names son of man son of God son of David it's just using that to understand what does transpire I'm not the one that said that he comes back here for a little while as son of man your prophet was expressing that but brother Dale I've read 49 quotes there's three sons named and then you write you're not listening three manifestations of God son of man son of God son of David what does it matter were you moving it hackers info you know an added ones word its clarification to understand what it's transpired all right this it's given us to an understand so you see how vital it is to understand we now have the plan because he you don't you you wouldn't be relating to word it out way I think I told you about it when I started studying this message and I studied it and studied it and I searched and when brother Brandon said three sons nine I could read I listened to the tapes I could follow that example a three sons night son of man son of God son today but I knew that you could go from son of man that would give his life to die for us to come into this dispensation of son of God but I couldn't follow it no way to be able to go from son of God the new birth and put us into the Millennium because that would be the next step and I thought Lord there's too much left there's something wrong how are we going to be changed what are we gonna do what's gonna take place and I told you about it you know we were listening this tape and I finally heard brother Branham on the unveiling of God where he said God's going to between this in other words between this son of God and Son of David is the son of man going to return to the earth that to me is the most vital thing you could ever think of I know people frown and snarl up their nose and what does that mean do we need to understand it I'll let you how the pulpit show me how you get time let me not restore casting or hateful I'm just truthful if you can show me how to get there then hey let's go that away you got an easier to do it let's get at it we've had 50 years of the attics right of people trying to explain all these things and that taking place yet so it's time to settle down and be serious about it well it'll just be this way this way we were just waiting on the bus to pull up we're waiting on this okay I'll pray to God he'll hurry up and get the bus here I'm getting old and I'll look back here and I see people we was life and life's not over - it's a fellowship meeting this brother was telling you know about Sean Sean and Wade and all of them was about that age I said yeah there's a gap bracket Dorothy y'all all fit into and I said you turn around and look there's another gap bracket here that's sitting here with great heart and we're all pruning up and getting ready for the nursing home we've had 50 years well I'm like this if I tried something for 50 years and it didn't work I'll try something else I'm just serious that's what I'm saying 40 years ago God began to reveal to me this and he showed me how that you'd go some son of man son of God son of man in between and then it would fit - come out - son of David son of man then in this that's dispensation I preached it to you over and over there is no rapture without this message there's no change of the body without this message this message brings all of those things we don't have to look for something else it's right there in the word to understand all of those things all right but you wind up in the Millennium all right now swallow let's start those well here on out you're gonna back up a little I'm telling you you're gonna back up and wonder where I'm going don't worry about where I'm going you just listen if it's right amen if it's right Oh me my office will be open when we get through you sit down and talk all you want to but I'm going to ask you one simple question he winds up to the Jews in the Millennium as son of David right we will have to agree with that that's that's not a question I'm not asking you to agree I'm asking you to be smart enough to shake your head yes because that's got to be because the Prophet said that's the way it's going to be okay we go to son of David in the Millennium all right you're still in time you're still under a seven the millennial reign is under a seven but a random actually covers the seventh Church age and talks about it being under the number seven and because it cares it right on the end of the millennium because it's still under time time has us all sealed in a bracket of death we're dying every time that clock go take that heart go don't don't don't do and every time they go don't don't it's wiring out om you'll have it don't worry about it just listen - horrible - night now just asking you a simple question how about - future home now we're gonna set with him around the throne in the Millennium right right I mean yeah that has to be agreed that means yeah okay brother Donny Reagan said one time he said you do like that that means a big Amen now what kind of a situation you're gonna exist in in the future home and I asked you a question how you gonna get there I just read your scripture that makes an outstanding statement but did you listen I just read your scripture and I'm going to use my terminologies and I'll back it up and the right way but for you to understand I just read your scriptures there's gonna be a time come that the sonship is going to terminate terminate is not a correct word I told you I'd use my wordings I don't have anymore but the son has got to become subdued or under subjection come on let's reread that pull it back up and Corinthians brother look first Corinthians 15 he's laying down 20 verse coming through he's laying down that Christ has risen from the dead and become the firstfruits for them to slip comes over into us for since by man came death Adam by man came also the resurrection of the Dead Christ the Son of man coming into being to word he could give his life to pay the price no where is in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive so we got to cherish that part but every man in his own order in other words got to be an order this a place of heart Christ the firstfruits now we're the firstfruits whether you concern he was the first fruit and we're the firstfruits by being in him or him being in us I'll get to that in a second afterward they that are Christ's and he's coming they they're to Christ and he's coming that's bringing in a people the first Adam is Christ right who's this Christ and he is coming I'd always gonna come with him I mean that's the best that I've always tried to have of that and we're gonna cover some scriptures it gets really hard to follow and then look at verse 24 then or at that time was shortly thereafter cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the father who need shall have put down all rule and all authority and power now when he's done this something's gonna transpire for he must reign who Christ the Lord Jesus till he hath put all enemies under his feet he's got a rule to live till all the enemies is put under his feet now what are these enemies he names them here the life tena me no matter how many more enemies you got just come to the lies to save time the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death well death was done away in Jesus Christ it was telling with 2,000 years ago brother though you're still dying you're getting older you want a mirror to pais around when you see them eggs lines that means age you know how you say those thing now watch even though death is destroyed in the new birth death is not destroyed physically are you listening now watch for he has put all things under his feet the word about it it's all under him don't take care of ain't got to be freely you got to wonder whether it works or not I don't know where about it's done but when he sayeth all things are put under him now when God says that it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him now how many of these ever looked that word up I preached on this before so don't worry about it go get Webster's dictionary and find accepting what is accepted mean well it just means you're accepted there's no word accepted that's the only definition you got only first word you got there's no definition of that word and then we went through the scripture come on folks I say it and you don't like it we studied these things in the Baptist Church you didn't read the Bible and study it and look upwards go look up the word accepted you don't believe me somebody won't go run and get wet for dictionary well it just it just means he's accepted but when he says all things are put under him it is manifest it's already done and finished that he is excepted which did put all things under him that means God's accepted come on if you read it gonna sayin we think we're so mark whether I can read except it means accepted I accepted that brother release can be $20 a day and I accepted it well what's that got to do with God in the manifestation you just make it too deep I didn't write the book I'm trying to get you for one time in your life to look at something we've been around here 50 years waiting on something what are you waiting on we know he has been accepted good look up the word that one worse says he has that's a CC EPT he did that's accepted this is e ex CEP TEP why they put that there I don't understand I just understand what it's saying look and when all things shall be subdued unto them then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all you know human plain old Georgia terminology it looks like he's talking about somewhere there that the sonship is terminated but it doesn't mean terminated like done away with it means something has happened and the only way you can describe it is just to say the son himself becomes subject so when this one up here and his manifest and he's accepted we did put all things under him cross and guard himself something's going to take place now when you're studying this if you'll do it and listen to me it save you a lot of trouble I'll try to do that brother branham explains this scripture in the future I mean in the cross the mystery of God reveal as being in the Millennium the son himself shall become subject then he describes it in the future home I like it when it's quiet you can hear a mouse run across the floor only thing I can hear his brains running sounds rough and somes fine cuz they're older another some fires ago turn very angry I think sometimes you ever lay down in the bed and you turn over one way you know y'all ain't old enough yet don't I look at it brother Lou easy no no dude you don't even know what I'm talkin about you turn one way us old folks and it goes rang in your head you turn over the other way to go yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you try to get in the middle to see if you can balance out the to him cogwheels is turning plain old brains i reckons wearing out all right now without the understanding of three sons names we would be in bad shape well rewrite but realize that no matter where we go from your own we still got to line up with our original thought that there's only three sons nuns so whatever is expressed or thought of in this it will still wind up in those three sons now son of man son of God son of David but we found out from the Prophet that he understood the scripture and he didn't inject he told us what it said if you try to study that accepted you'll see what I'm talking about that's not a CCE PTD that's accepted I accepted the $20 brother Louise gave me but that's not what that word means is it manifest that God is or whatever is taking place he has done it so perfectly until within his own self he stands back and looks at it and he says all is well then it's made manifest don't worry about it I got it another message on this one okay at least one more then we'll have questions and answers let you think on it so with the idea now that we've got a a way of doing things we know now how to go from son of man son of God son of David right so we go by the Prophet son of God a son of man son of God injected the son of man to fulfil Malachi 4 I'm quoting brother Branham and it comes out to where you got it man oh god son of man son of David you're not adding anything you just using or utilizing what is the word for you're just using things to bring it to a clarity that's what I said if you keep on studying that word Exe you'll see it'll come to that that you have an understanding of a manifestation what manifestation and guarding the old testament up through the new i'm talking about in the Matthew Mark Luke and John he was son of man right then through the seven churches the son of God uh-huh then in the Millennial which finishes it up under the Jews he'll be the son of David alright so we use the key to get to those things to be able to move from one to the other to wind up and seeing how whatever gets them in the Millennium guess I said the Millennium right which is the plan of redemption now being in that plan of redemption is so important of understanding how you can get there whoa I wasn't my like my brother's hood why didn't matter when I get to heaven they don't matter how get tired it's all I get dark well that's a good point it don't fit too good it was a good boy well he sounds good but it just might be if I'm not concerned how I'll get there angle get to know in my beat is I don't know how to get there if it ain't clear fired up another on how to get that so we were anchored our mind should be settled to worry okay we got it to work that you go front of man son of God son of man in the end time and then son of David okay that should be this way you don't have to but that ought to be going that way it shouldn't be that way I remember one of the kids one day and I said something you know one of them said something to me and I said I said yeah they asked me the same question again I said yes there's a wait a minute daddy said your mouth is saying one thing in your head saying something else okay you don't never think about what will it be in the future all I ask you to read the message of your journal you know or listen to tight you ain't asking for a raise I am I just said I asked you to now if you did you would find a lot of key answers within that which would be this picture used in the future home all right what will God be like in the future huh I thought that's what bringing this morning that the Bible will said that even the eternal Godhead could be understood by the things that we see right we quote that a lot don't we the eternal Godhead can be seen by the things you know understood by the things we see we see it over here we see it over here we see it in a baby we see it in it we see it in that we sit in Oliver a lot of expressing the eternal Godhead to understand what mankind has never been able to follow even with the wording of that because that's mirror that's merely a quote to most people I'm not throwing up on the body now come on get straight you you think that they're preaching in the denominations there's three sons names and we need to get this from need to get down and get to that now they figured out none of it yeah ain't going off on nobody now let's move from that how about moving up in this message alright get what we live any none of my business what God does over there I don't mean that wrong I want him to be over there and do what he wants to do but he's what I'm what's happening here try to bring it in the simplicity and people say you're too deep that's an excuse I don't understand how to rebuild a motor that's an excuse so ain't gonna tackle it told you about that time Richard took that motor apart man he was throwing boats every which way and I said I'd number every one of them where they went and try to put them back where they that he sold they'll all go back well you know surprising to me you know he got the thing back together and you it run I know what it would have done if I'd have been putting it together gonna mean some of them boats was the same lips and everything but he said now that Boat Diaries he's hot tempered steel then it goes here this one here wouldn't put it over here okay long as you know what you're doing but that's an excuse right I had the opportunity to sit down there with Richard at that time and say I'll explain all these boats no I didn't do it I didn't want to I didn't want to know it another one go never use it right that's an excuse I remember brother Hanson's telling one time was it brother hands are some pretty sure you know somebody told me one time that their daddy was I think if it wouldn't him if they're dead and their mom and him was gone and oh no it's my brother-in-law and then even some boys decided they needed to just running around while daddy mama was gone we come find that daddy pulled the motor out of the car and tore it apart well they put it back together yeah they put it back together drove where the woman to go and come back took it back apart and tobi back in to try but it in that his daddy could never get that car to run after the hint so maybe that's what we're doing okay all right everybody ready listen do you ever think about heaven you ever think about the future home now what is God gonna look like I mean the basics of organized religion you know brother Ernie Villanueva to tell you about that and I gets the tickle Danny and he says they got it all figured out and says you're such the father over here and said here's that's the son over here or another throw and said here's that dove floating around over here supposed to be the Holy Ghost and that's the Great Trinity of Almighty God yeah we laugh at them but what do you think I mean a sensible answer is okay with me well what do you think God's gonna be like in the future huh are you gonna take Dave it in the throne plop it over the future home you know better than that you've got enough sense know better than that what's it gonna be like I said a sensible answer now what a scriptural answer the Bible plainly tells you what he looked like oh it does well according to the scripture the God according to Philippians and I didn't given them okay according to Philippians 3 and 21 who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able to even to subdue all things under himself now what's that saying what kind of body you gonna have a body like his body is that that readin hmm well whatever he is we are whatever he looks like we look like is that sensible when we get in a few of them they might get this thing to go tonight a while the Prophet on the message Jesus at the door he's somebody being 20-30 years old and all he's taking you in to Pho ship some day in the face of of all that has criticized you you'll be glorified no matters now and made a body like unto his own glorious body it is coming unless ease who is this are you coming down riding on the white horse and we're coming Caesar all right from the portals of glory to change in fashion this old corruptible bodies of ours into a glorious body lacking to his own body what kind of a body they were what it is gonna be like him you get to okay so now come on I'm just being serious and ain't being silly I guess - is it does he look like a monkey no you know that's why I like the message it doesn't can you know it doesn't cut our throats is what we think but you know according to brother branham he says the closest he can understand her of seeing of Christ when he was seen him after her in the field was like now he just said it exactly like it he didn't say that he said like unto Jesus at 33 no don't he evidently looks human you know I mean that and so I don't think he's gonna look like that like monkeys you know you've been silly okay what is it true so we're gonna have a body like unto his glorious body his body was made eternal in the resurrection right it was so much into change but not changing so far but Mary didn't under didn't see it she seen him and didn't understand who that was but when he spoke to her he cuz he's about 21 years old and she knew him is about 33 years old looking 50 so but in a minute she said Jesus you know know somewhere around 18 19 20 years old he's gonna look and we're gonna look like they have so you're gonna change you know but ain't gonna be nobody there were warped up bodies and twisted arms and legs missing and he's gone and that's an emphasis to make some of you probably would use 20 years old you go home and look in the mirror and say oh Lord I hope I don't look like that right but what is it gonna look like whoa okay we got it all figured out God is a spirit amen thank God for that you'll never change from that he's always been a spirit he always will be experienced and the spirit can't be saying unless the spirit takes a form they can't be seen so what form is he gonna be in come on win the fierce your home sitting in the future home with the Lord Jesus Christ talking about what he looks like just remember you can't do away with any manifestation of God don't ever do that I don't care what you think about it don't ever do away with any manifestation you keep adding to I guess it's the best way to say it you can never take away anything from God because he's perfect start with all right now then what do you expect to see now I said you expect to thrown over here and I thrown over here and a flutter flutter the Dove over here no I don't want that no we don't want what do you think well I don't really know and really I don't think it matters well if he walked in here right now what would it matter what if he walked in here right now how would you know him Mary had the connection to the voice right but then when she did realize that voice that was speaking to her her mind could roll back to where he would be 20 years of age now she can put things together one brother Nell I just never really thought about guarded as to what's it gonna be when we get up to heaven one week on base we're gonna little spooks we had lunch bucks over like floating around in this hour hey come on brother branham even in the day that he was expressing it listen in the days he was expressing what it would be like before he went beyond the curtain of time he did finality give that body something read it he would be expressing it and he said we couldn't hug brother Neville or shake his hand but he would bring a finality to a point that things could be tangible but you'll never lose the scripture saying God is a spirit you can't see his spirit it has to have a manifestation for you to be able to understand anything about a spirit now I'm coming up in the message - one little spot and then I'm on back off deliberately so just follow with me up to that point and then we'll back off to the next message because I got a lot of scriptures to be involved and I want your thoughts to be resting upon some things until that time so now listen after all of these things of God revealing himself to man and that was the scriptures we had this morning that's what the Sun came to do right the Sun came to reveal the father see the father revealed the Sun through manifestation right through healings and signs and wonders his voice in fact but he made God manifest into what until they said Schwarzer father he said Philip have I been so long with you since have you seen me you've seen the father well what father look like the son or is that it is that plain enough languages because jesus knew that was inside of him was spirit God and he knew that could never be seen by mankind with more lies what are you gonna have now a body like unto his glorious body tell those the scriptures for what he does go ahead go ahead to number seven let's catch the little point we'll go so far quick go up to number seven and before he's getting there uh I'll tell you where he's reading from he's reading from John 14 all right now he's reading from John 14 okay now cuz that's when he comes to the scripture as God was in Christ notice now garden making himself no not we're not supposed to make converts to Christianity by government but by the revelation the Christ in u.s. God was in Christ as God was in Christ Christ in you when that God what that God did in Christ Christ does in you what signs did God in Christ Christ does in you oh isn't that beautiful oh my like that Jesus said at that day now that's John you know 14:20 at that day you shall know that I am in the father in me and you and me and I knew very well scripture jesus said that that day that's this day no III believe brother Branham was told let's see where that would have been Tom was 63 across the mister God reveal I kind of believe he was talking about right then don't you right now you talking about right then okay at that day that's this day at that day when this revelation is made known Christ is a mystery of God revealed when it's made known that's today he's talking about now when it does and it's made known listen to this and you will know that I am in the father and the father in me okay we should understand that because Jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father so that should be easy to understand that I am in the father and the father in me now look I knew that's the new birth right come on you got a little bit okay that's the new birth I in you now that's easy to comprehend right but not read the nesting and you and me you and me I in you by the new birth and you in me you in me somebody give me a good definition of that and you and me you realize that that day if you got the revelation you're gonna find out God and man as one and you're gonna find out where I gave it to you lean not to your understanding I give it if you go to weaken got it laying here we're brethren said God's not complete without you now then we can understand a little bit of this you in me because when the revelation of that is made manifest at that day you'll know that I and the father are one I am in the father and the father is in me then when the revelation comes forth then it's I in you and you in me now we can understand it by Chrysler mister God revealed that we're our God what we have within us not this flesh not these things were but the eternal life that is within these bodies by the new birth it's a part of God so we're getting into something lately in other words probable Colossians then says this all in me and I'd have how is that what do we read it forget it get 2 Corinthians we'll read it but I want to make sure you followed Colossians and it comes down to be one time three long-suffering women it's in Colossians well that's where I'm reading from yeah but Christ is all verse 11 and in all Christ is all and in all now let's don't do is one brother did one time around here he gave the cabbage the Holy Ghost I never did agree with that tumor that's good I didn't like the idea but that was his point yeah I don't think everybody's got the Holy Ghost I don't think that saying Christ is in all you know seven billion people in the world they'd all of got Christ that's what the scripture says oh that he wouldn't say that's what you saying it says who is the all in all when these days we get on predestination where we're chosen in the M right but what about it now what about a thought go ahead to number eight because we're not gonna have time to go way over we'll just go so far cut it and God at that day which is what day now this day the day of this revelation right from across the mister God revealed okay and God it that day the kingdom be given over to the Father now remember Jesus in the church ages and what we've been through that you'll sit with me and my throne as I have overcome and set with my father in his strong now he overcame and sit with the father in his throne with the baptism of the Holy Ghost right right are we right now uh-huh-huh-huh the baptism of the Holy Ghost made that right all right now then we're to come down to the church ages and sit with him in his throne as he could which his throne is the Millennium right the throne of Jesus is the Millennium that's what your prophet said all right you will not do that brother thing I mean I know it but it makes you think I always told you a good speaker is one that can get you to think so if I got a slap you with it now slap you let it get you think now watch what he's saying some worse something's going to take place and God if that day the kingdom be given over to the father okay he might be all in all well he's yet speaking out here or David Christ see that's what I'm saying Christ the mystery he's uses his scripture as a millennium future home he uses it the future home this scripture its compound meaning because it's got to be Tod that we go we got to get that man in the Millenium sitting on the throne and then be able to get him off that throne and move over into the future home we can't leave him sitting on the throne come on when he's yet speaking out here David Christ David sitting on the throne the king over the whole human race and while they're yet thinking I'll know what they're thinking about before they speak I'll answer them okay go ahead a number no which is taken from the future home now we're gonna use this scripture Andy's descended upon the throne in that perfect kingdoms when time the kingdom that Jesus is to surrender to the Father Laurita the kingdom that Jesus is to surrender to the father that God might be all and in all that's not just all and all that's all and in all read it cuz that's what the scripture says not in the Colossians Corinthians then he might be all and in all Jesus sets upon his throne here as our Joseph and the king is the light that will be on top of the Mount Zion not to millennium future home and his holy light will flood into our city hallelujah we're gonna get to in the next message that there ain't no light in the future home the lamb and God is the light that's what the Bible says you don't need no light bubs well you can go on down on 449 where veterans explain into paradise and lots of the world and the perfect kingdom not the seventh day that's the doctor seventh day the eternal not the Millennium the new earth coming on down no just a second what's gonna happen let's see what's gonna happen one day so now we've got to the future home and we got to father which is the Holy Spirit or the Spirit of God and God is a spirit and they that it were and that'll never be done away with but now we've got the son into the future home go ahead a number 11 on top of my design will set the lamp and the city will need no light for the lamb is the light thereof and above the lamb will be the father which is the low gosh now there's Yuki if you'll just read it there's the lamb who's the lamb come on somebody answer who's the lamb Jesus is the lamb so Jesus is going to be there but something's got to happen well the lamb is a lot thereof and above the lamb will be the father when you're Trinitarian we thought we had this thing figured out we finally got it down to tunas and you got it down to oh you just messing my mind up he messing your mind up he's already messed up get it straight God the great lot the eternal light that assigned just above the throne and Jesus will not be on his Father's throne he'll be on his throne now we've moved from the son of David to the future home not as son of David but we've retained his throne listen don't do away with the throne don't do away with anything just bring it and bring it into place look and the father will hover over the son you just messing me up for this I your prophet is go fast with him about it and the father will hover over the son which the father and son will be one come on here's the Sun the lamb the son the father just hovers over him look over there brother Aaron was preaching about the the happening there was when God created the angels and thing said what was it just took a little dust and flunked it out and I went a body and the father will hover over the son which the father and the son will be one and while they're yet speaking I'll answer before they can think I'm thinking for them now that's what we need and Jesus will will commit a perfect perfect age to the perfect Living God that he has redeemed and give over to the father is that right we'll turn to God the Father which is spirit not a man spirit all nature of goodness is gathered together that's God and in goodness now anything perverted from good is evil that Satan's Kingdom a perfect Kingdom now go back to Corinthians and let's read there see if that's what it says okay bring it up Corinthians we'll start about verse 26 try to save time the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death death is not destroyed for everybody until the lake of fire which is after the Millenium and the white throne is after the Millennium the white throne is just prior to the future home there's where death will be finally totally annihilated go to remember there's another scripture there is talking about if we don't see everything clearly but said we see Jesus we see just enough to get us down that's plain as I can say it the life's to enemy that shall be destroyed his death where he has put all things under his feet though when he says all things are put under his feet it is manifest that he is there's that little word accepted well it means he's accepted why is it not still they see CPTED come on you'll never find that words will go F yourself we should put all things under him now look and when all things shall be subdued unto Him who god then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all you know they will say the major of that next message something's gonna happen in a future home I just read you where the Prophet said the lamb will be their God I just hover over that lamb and God will be one what were you seeing in the future home I've always thought this if Jesus is right when he said if you've seen me you've seen the father if that's right see then what do you expect to see in the future home or the millennium or anywhere I expect to see Jesus but I'll realize Jesus is Almighty God I realized what he kept trying to say if you've seen me you've seen the father cuz I'm my father one he kept trying to describe that read Matthew Mark Luke and John he kept trying to declare who he was and a kingdom a kingdom that would come to the right place see when he relinquishes are all things he becomes subject himself and when he becomes subject itself he just simply sets her and the father just hovers over the son when you look you'll see Jesus but you'll know who he is there's one God not one guarding our thoughts and ideas just one guard when you can come to the end of all of it with one he was one in the beginning is to be one in the end don't lose any manifestation he had in the middle or anywheres else John could stand there and look at him sitting there in the Millenium he could say there's the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world well what could he see when he's standing in the future home whatever thing is eternal and he's got an eternal revelation in his heart and he said there's the Lamb of God there's the Lamb of God he said well what do you think you're going to see I'm gonna see Jesus now listen the reason I'm gonna know it is cuz I'm gonna have a body like unto his glorious body you shook your head this away while ago I'm gonna have a body like unto his glorious body hey if he's sitting there and the father hovers over it what's the matter we're thinking wit you'll be sitting there and the father can hover over you and say this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell let's feel Bible you know what do you like it or not come on come on musicians think on these things I've still got a lot of scripture to be covered because it'll cover and show exactly what we're talking about that's not trinitarianism and it's certainly not one that's cuz you'll never do away see where the one this would be wrong the oneness would do away with everything one that will one I said that in the whole message today because it ain't gonna do away it's going to in to enhance or magnify the fact that God is going to hover over and when you see it you'll see Jesus but you'll know who he is you'll know then that I and my father are one what about it Mustang that God maybe all this is the next message and in all because we can't come out in the same position same place in same part with the message then we've missed it this is not an adding true this is expressing the Word of God well brother Branham didn't explain I've read you what he explained is that enough yeah but he never said so it's Ansan so that gets me you can talk to people and if you miss one word bud they'll straighten you out in a hurry you just say one day that's it it doesn't say that it says at that day well they're so smart but so idiotic lead um do not realize you've just said the same time but they want to correct you right you just make one little slip-up and you watch them yeah you didn't say that right well no try I tried well we got really page 26 and it's probably when everybody that city anybody have a need on the top of Mount Zion is a city and near Gloria the fish I shall look on its beauty in the morning when I reach that I will see [Music] pounds I so what because we will be happy of Easter and Carly ages when I reach that city or I'm invited to come on to that sit okay buddy got an issue so ever and fine imagine for me when I reach that City all that [Music] yeah I love these things [Music] ages when I reach that city then we'll name that's me and that's it like that what about our city wherever thank eternal ain't no bueno figured I could you can't have any turtle Sanders [Music] ages when I reach that CEO so I'll stay here until my savior calls me trying [Music] what about a turn you'll see what are you liking when we get that I reach that city we'll say Jesus No [Music] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus I never let my your scotch he's a yeoman we thank you for it on the top of Mount Zion is a sea lady and the with glory in the face I shall look on its beauty and the more [Applause] reach that city on Oh [Music] instead [Music] [Applause] changes when I reach that City what about it and I reached that city on the hill it'll all be gone all our carnality x' and all the things would be gone when we get dark we'll see him as he is we'll understand understand what he's done to get our star what a wonderful thing what a wonderful position see we haven't ended the message we think we in here we end our see that's why when brother branham got to the future home if you're listening to it they asked him said you got anything he said you're putting something else onto another day he said you're a topologist you got a house scripture see that's as far as they could see now come on they could read the Bible and they read of those things and they read of those eight days and all this that the other they studied those thing but the mind of mankind was locked as far as he could go was the millennial reign no one ever talked to a future home he said I ain't run out of tops he said I got one more he took it right on over and went into that 8th day and went straight across with it I've asked you to just read after seeing that 8th day all things will be made new to be made eternal a wonderful place for me I'm enjoying while I'm here don't know about you but I do I'll give you a little key that I've tried for explain for a long time it's very serious to me and I've always been that way any of you remember me trying to explain this when you see a revelation of something when God is revealing something to you and you're sitting there in that pew and you see what's being said just raise your hands and say I claim my family I claim my children I claim my husband my wife by the brothers and sisters just right while that's being revealed to you that's being made known why because you're in a heavenly atmosphere of when it's being revealed it's easy to receive your healing God wakes you up in the middle of the night starts speaking to you about some showing you think just say thank you lord thank you for my family thank you for my husband my children with her thank you lord you ain't gonna stop him from revealing it to you it's just something I learned a long time ago a little key to being able to accept from God it's number one recognize God is present knowing that he's revealing it to him he gotta be present if he's present then I can ask anything right try it sometime father we thank you we've tried to express our thoughts that we've been much trying to bring we just ask you now to help us them bless the people give understanding maybe Lord to the hearts and lives as we go our separate ways today going on our way home you just kind of speak to our hearts and let us Lord see you and your love and understanding of us bless and guide each one remember the sick ones Lord and father just be with wait as he's traveling give him a safe journey back home and everything be alright we love you we thank you guide us now bless the people on the way home give everybody a safe journey that your love may be made manifest we love you in Jesus name you're dismissed page 107 there's a country far beyond the starry sky there's a city [Music] there [Music] in that city [Music]
