[0:04] good to be here
[0:08] today had a good time
[0:10] yesterday kids had fun the adults did
[0:14] get out of
[0:16] bed probably a little bit sore playing
[0:18] ball and stuff that's okay it's all
[0:22] right Bible says bodily exercise profit
[0:26] a little so it does profit a little
[0:29] [Music]
[0:31] unless you gets old start you start
[0:34] hurting sometimes you get a little
[0:35] wisdom and you know better so you just
[0:37] don't play at all yeah amen I
[0:42] have you know there used to be when you
[0:44] participated there was The
[0:46] Observers and now that now that someone
[0:49] else participates you be the Observer
[0:52] Regina just asked if I play wisdom W
[0:55] yeah right
[0:56] uhuh never mind with that one cuz we're
[0:58] on the internet
[1:01] we're live on this no
[1:03] comment all right let's uh let's go to
[1:06] Revelation 6 and let's get started with
[1:07] the four seal now I want you to keep in
[1:11] mind keep in mind you got to turn that
[1:14] computer keep in
[1:17] mind keep in mind that uh when we get
[1:21] finished with this four seal the Rapture
[1:24] has taken place okay when the force seal
[1:27] has opened and we get a revelation of
[1:30] who we are and what we're doing
[1:32] here
[1:34] and have the word established in our
[1:36] heart then the seal has done its job the
[1:40] seals have done their job and we're gone
[1:43] that's right is that all right yes all
[1:45] right so you got 1 2 3 4 5 6
[1:49] [Music]
[1:52] seven all right let's look right
[1:56] here one 2 three four five six 7 now
[2:01] just just do this we did
[2:03] this a few weeks ago but just to go back
[2:06] over there's your there's your
[2:08] seals which is one open then two open
[2:12] then three open then four open then five
[2:14] open then six open then seven open all
[2:17] right
[2:19] now we know one thing's for
[2:22] sure that
[2:30] the seventh seal is a
[2:32] mystery so let's just erase it off it's
[2:35] a mystery because it's in interwined in
[2:38] all the seals right okay so the seventh
[2:41] seal is not just it's like we were
[2:44] talking about before so seventh seal is
[2:45] the end of all things end of the
[2:48] struggling world end of this end of that
[2:50] end but it's not an end like we think an
[2:52] end it's a beginning our end is our is
[2:55] our new is our beginning into eternal
[2:58] life right
[3:00] so you take the seven seal out of the
[3:03] equation because he is the equation he's
[3:05] all of them all right because there's
[3:08] not going to be brother R said the
[3:09] seventh seal brings him back to Earth
[3:11] well when that seventh seal
[3:13] opens to us as
[3:16] individuals it does bring you back on
[3:18] Earth EMP power the way that he was when
[3:20] he was standing on Earth brother BR said
[3:22] he become visible Among Us raised the
[3:25] dead going to Rapture now we know for
[3:26] sure that Jesus is not going to walk
[3:28] through the door the visibility
[3:30] of Jesus Christ in the end time in under
[3:33] the seventh seal is such a mystery till
[3:35] it's intertwined into his
[3:39] people cuz there's not a
[3:41] seal I think sometimes we think well
[3:44] there's a seal out
[3:46] here let's see like a what was that NY
[3:49] Drew Mysteries you know you get a clue
[3:52] here and a clue here and you you go
[3:54] through and and the tomb Raiders and all
[3:57] that stuff you know and Indiana Jones
[3:59] and you get a clue here and you you
[4:01] click a key here and then this key opens
[4:03] this well spiritually yes that happens
[4:05] but that's not a natural you're not
[4:08] going to go and try to find in other
[4:09] words this natural seal this is all
[4:12] hidden man doesn't know one thing about
[4:13] it normal man well I don't say normal
[4:16] man we're the only normal people in the
[4:18] world right but insane part of the world
[4:22] even the even the devil doesn't know
[4:25] what these seals can do he knows that
[4:28] there was one and Hey listen he was
[4:29] there when these things were spoken
[4:32] that's right okay but like brother R
[4:35] said if it lays on the page can be quite
[4:37] question but once it comes into a life
[4:39] see he he
[4:44] couldn't he couldn't get in these seals
[4:46] like we do now he can be so close
[4:48] brother Christian I were talking
[4:50] yesterday so close doesn't mean out
[4:53] there he believes the way we believe
[4:54] that the two seeds in the framework of
[4:56] the church the mess's church this church
[4:58] right okay the two spirits in the
[5:01] framework of the message church so it's
[5:03] the two spirits in the framework of the
[5:04] message
[5:05] church denominations I don't say they
[5:08] don't care about the seals but you'll
[5:10] never hear them preach them because they
[5:12] don't understand them that's right and
[5:15] if they do they get a carnal application
[5:17] of a man standing with a f in a book and
[5:19] tearing seals off and reading something
[5:21] that's never been written
[5:23] before but that's not what happened even
[5:26] with the prophet of God when that seal
[5:28] got tore open or when that
[5:30] top got ripped out of the pyramid Rock
[5:34] and like it wasn't that new words were
[5:37] down in that pyramid he said the he in
[5:40] other words he didn't say the words were
[5:42] there but he said light had never Shone
[5:43] on that before well the words had to be
[5:46] there it's just that there wasn't light
[5:48] shining on them it was sealed up so
[5:51] that's the same way with these seals
[5:52] they are sealed
[5:54] up
[5:55] Daniel go to your people seal this up
[5:58] till the time of the end
[6:01] I don't know that Daniel didn't see the
[6:03] seals but you know what he done he saw
[6:04] the mighty Angel come down out of Heaven
[6:07] just like what happened in type and
[6:09] sunset Mountain what happened over there
[6:11] is the same thing happened to Daniel cuz
[6:13] there was an angel come down put one
[6:15] foot on land one foot don't see
[6:17] right one in Revelations say time will
[6:19] be no longer cuz that's Gentile but
[6:22] remember in Daniel's time when he put
[6:23] one foot on land one foot on sea he said
[6:25] this is for a time times and a dividing
[6:27] of times three and 1/2 years so that was
[6:29] was to Israel and really the seals are
[6:31] to
[6:32] Israel they're not to us they're to
[6:35] Israel cuz brother R said Revelations
[6:37] what 41 to Revelations 19 is all to
[6:41] Israel well Revelation 6 is in between
[6:44] that you know but we get this we have to
[6:47] get the spiritual aspect of this
[6:49] happening so that it can go to Israel
[6:52] right through the two prophets okay so
[6:56] we have to get an understanding and a
[6:57] Breaking of all these seals
[7:01] to understand what's going on so
[7:05] now want to pick that off there cuz it's
[7:08] holding up my
[7:16] thing this is the rapture okay is that
[7:19] all right yes that doesn't do away with
[7:22] five six and seven right
[7:24] okay now what has to happen to me and
[7:27] you now listen to me what has to happen
[7:28] to me and you
[7:37] 5 six and 7even has to lap back okay
[7:40] under the for
[7:42] S cuz we got to have to me 5 six and
[7:46] 7even is the is the apex of the change
[7:50] of your body
[7:52] okay who who took a body
[7:55] chain the man the man himself I I you
[7:59] know let's go even call it the seventh
[8:00] anymore let's call it the man cuz it's
[8:03] not the spirit Christ Jesus no it's not
[8:06] the Jehovah Christ Jesus it's the man
[8:10] it's the flesh man cuz the seventh seal
[8:13] was preaching the Sixth Seal so it
[8:15] wasn't and sure when you say well what
[8:16] are you doing away with God no but I'm
[8:19] showing you there's a man there's a
[8:20] flesh man had to come on Earth and he
[8:23] had to speak us into existence by the
[8:27] spoken word of God right amen
[8:30] so he's the man I was think about
[8:33] yesterday
[8:36] um how
[8:38] that what name I'm sorry what title does
[8:43] Jesus Christ mean the most to you what
[8:48] title what
[8:51] title son of man what title what
[8:57] title you see the son of man die and go
[9:00] to
[9:07] hell Revelations 5 if that man don't
[9:11] redeem your soul you're
[9:14] dead and we know it's the son of man but
[9:17] Redeemer to me to me that's the Apex of
[9:19] what God means to me if he hasn't come
[9:22] he can come as Rose of Sharon Lily in
[9:24] the valley that's okay you know what
[9:26] that's peace that's Joy but without that
[9:29] Redeemer that's why I that last Sunday I
[9:32] I spent so much time on on what job saw
[9:36] job saw my redeemer liveth he didn't see
[9:39] sure he saw son of man but he couldn't
[9:40] call him that he didn't say son of man
[9:43] he said I know my redeemer what he saw a
[9:46] man take his sin throw it away and even
[9:50] though the skin worms destroy my body in
[9:53] my flesh I'll see this Redeemer because
[9:55] he's the one that did the redeeming he
[9:57] redeemed me back
[10:00] okay so that's to me and that's me you
[10:03] you can say well he means this but that
[10:06] right there if that Revelations 5 man
[10:08] hadn't to took that book as a redeemer
[10:10] that's right if he hadn't to come to
[10:12] this earth he's the only one that could
[10:14] be a redeemer right you say oh I'll die
[10:17] for brother Bob and I would give him a
[10:21] life for it but that don't save him none
[10:23] at all that's
[10:25] right hello I can be so peaceful he can
[10:28] call me the prin of Peace if you right
[10:30] that's right but I know he can call me
[10:32] the Prince of Peace he can call me
[10:35] Jehovah that's right but when he says
[10:38] you can he says you can redeem me from
[10:42] where I was to where you are that to me
[10:46] is the that's to me is the Divine love
[10:49] because there's no no only one man could
[10:51] do that brother Bram told us he said one
[10:53] man can't die for another even though
[10:55] you can die for them give your life but
[10:57] you can't transfer your life
[11:01] okay see if I transferred my life into
[11:03] Bob it'd still be sinful it'd be just
[11:05] it'd be just born in sin shap and
[11:07] iniquity but when that Redeemer came
[11:09] that's right when Heaven and Earth
[11:12] kissed and he became the man Christ
[11:14] Jesus not the
[11:16] spirit you got it yes we must worship
[11:19] Him in spirit and Truth we know that but
[11:21] what but what kind of spirit do we
[11:23] worship if Jesus would have never
[11:25] come we'd have never seen a redeemer
[11:30] Son of God is not the Redeemer that's
[11:32] right the son of man's the Redeemer the
[11:34] man that came to this earth and gave his
[11:36] life so I was tell him brother Lis I
[11:39] asked him the titles what title would
[11:41] you give Jesus Christ or the man what
[11:44] title would you give him they said Son
[11:45] of Man a different one I said yeah
[11:47] that's true I said but the son of man
[11:48] you believe in the son of man there's a
[11:50] lot of people believe in the son of man
[11:53] hey be real truthful about it me and
[11:55] brother Chris we talking about yesterday
[11:57] Judas didn't know he was a son of man
[11:59] man but he knew one thing for sure he
[12:00] said in his in other words he said if
[12:03] you're who you say you
[12:04] are you're a powerful guy and that man
[12:08] gave Judas power to cast out Devils
[12:11] that's right and he was a devil himself
[12:13] or the devil entered into him later we
[12:14] know that but his predestination was
[12:17] that he was going to accept the money
[12:19] and and go to predition right but
[12:23] still
[12:24] okay he still was judas's Redeemer right
[12:29] if Judas would have went on to the end
[12:31] if Judas would have went to Pentecost
[12:33] God would have redeemed
[12:34] him so to me that's the most powerful
[12:37] name right there you can call him
[12:39] whatever you want to call him but if he
[12:40] if he's not your Redeemer then you're
[12:42] lost that's you're lost whether we take
[12:46] a body change or not if we're saved
[12:48] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[12:50] sitting in Heavenly places right now he
[12:51] is my redeemer and my soul and whatever
[12:54] I got in me is going to come right back
[12:56] up cuz he redeemed me and he even
[12:59] redeemed my body at
[13:01] Calvary CLA he claimed that body at
[13:04] Calvary right so that's to me Redeemer
[13:07] when you say Redeemer that means and you
[13:10] know brother dick likes to say Creator
[13:12] and that's
[13:13] okay but he created Judas he created the
[13:17] devil he cre that's okay to say Creator
[13:20] because that gives him that position but
[13:23] when I'm standing in my
[13:26] position just knowing he created me well
[13:29] what about Satan he knows God created
[13:31] him but yet he still wants to destroy
[13:32] him he wants to destroy God but here I
[13:36] am on this side of the sin curse looking
[13:39] at my
[13:40] redeemer and if and if he's if I say if
[13:43] for you not for me but if he's my
[13:45] redeemer he's going to take me back
[13:47] regardless of anything that goes on okay
[13:50] so it's just a point to
[13:52] ponder about that word
[13:54] Redeemer that's why job that's why
[13:56] brother Brown said job saw the
[13:58] resurrection he knew he got to a point
[14:01] he knew his redeemer is the one that was
[14:04] going to do it Jo couldn't do it
[14:06] remember Jo was a little bit
[14:07] self-righteous Pro I can do that I can I
[14:10] can I can I
[14:12] right no there's only one man that says
[14:15] I can I will and I'm going to and he's
[14:17] already done it and that was Christ
[14:18] Jesus you know all power in heaven and
[14:20] earth been given unto me true all right
[14:22] so there's your man so what here on we
[14:24] got a background a little bit we got the
[14:27] Rapture taking place right here on this
[14:28] seal that we're talking about the bride
[14:31] is seen no
[14:33] more from Revelations 41 remember when
[14:37] John saw a door open in heaven Amen
[14:41] brother B said that's the Rapture cu the
[14:43] Bible says after these things what after
[14:45] the revelations 3 the seven Church ages
[14:47] all right after the seven Church ages
[14:49] Revelations 4 there was a door open in
[14:51] heaven well that's Rapture from 41 to
[14:54] Revelations
[14:56] 19 is all to the Je
[15:01] all
[15:02] right but we have to have the spiritual
[15:04] part of this okay we have to have the
[15:07] spiritual part to get us to Revelations
[15:09] 19 where where right here it was a bride
[15:13] right here's a
[15:14] wife
[15:16] okay this is the bride this is the bride
[15:19] in the seven Church ages this is him
[15:21] coming back with his wife I'm a tour
[15:24] Lady
[15:26] okay got everybody got that
[15:29] so Revelations
[15:31] 41-19 is all to the Jews but we can't
[15:34] tear it out and say well that's not for
[15:37] us we don't need to understand it we
[15:39] can't do that we got to have the
[15:40] spiritual part of all the Bible amen all
[15:43] the
[15:45] Revelation oh y'all pray for June this
[15:47] morning her mother had a accident this
[15:50] morning and didn't make it to the
[15:53] bathroom she's having to clean it up so
[15:54] that's why she's not here but keep her
[15:56] in your prayers and deana's there too
[15:58] that's why I just saw her faith
[16:00] but we'll get to it
[16:02] um Rapture takes place on a four seal
[16:05] everybody got that
[16:07] why prophet of God because what your
[16:10] combat Beast are
[16:11] gone
[16:13] right that's the Holy
[16:16] Ghost amen that's the Holy Ghost the
[16:19] combat Beast is the Holy Ghost cuz right
[16:21] here and when he had opened the fish
[16:23] still I saw under the altar the souls it
[16:25] doesn't say I looked and behold a Pale
[16:27] Horse and his name s him was death hell
[16:28] Fallen power was given to him all down
[16:30] through here got
[16:32] it let me go back up one and when he
[16:35] open the for SE I heard the voice of the
[16:37] fourth Beast which is what the man let's
[16:40] write that right here man I mean I'm
[16:42] sorry Eagle right here I got it right
[16:45] there that's the eagle
[16:47] anointing why because the eagle
[16:49] anointing is going to carry us off the
[16:51] Earth that four seal is going to carry
[16:53] us off the Earth because what is it
[16:55] justification sanctification baptism of
[16:57] the Holy Ghost and and then the word
[16:59] back in power like it was because what
[17:02] is the seven still what is the man he
[17:04] was the what word made
[17:12] flesh like I said Sunday you got to
[17:14] remember one thing whatever he gets we
[17:16] get right we are heirs and join airs
[17:19] that means that if he's at this position
[17:21] we're not at this one that's right
[17:25] whatever HS and Joint HS is right there
[17:28] right that's right that's what we're not
[17:29] believing we're believing that he's way
[17:31] up under somewhere and we way down here
[17:33] somewhere
[17:34] okay he has made us Kings and priest why
[17:37] that's Revelations 5 he took the bug
[17:39] he's the Redeemer he's the one that's
[17:41] redeemed at
[17:42] all listen when he took that bug he
[17:44] redeemed everything from Adam that's
[17:46] right Adam all the way to the Future
[17:48] home amen all right so that's how
[17:51] powerful that seventh seal it okay the
[17:54] word made
[17:57] flesh all right so
[18:00] now seal 1 2 3 and 4 and then we'll read
[18:03] the seal here excuse me 1 2 3 and 4 is
[18:07] your combat beef your lion ox man and
[18:10] Eagle everybody got that we've been over
[18:12] and over should all right but I want you
[18:15] to see
[18:17] that cuz when we go to 5 six and
[18:25] seven why is the reason we take a
[18:27] Rapture just because the day on the
[18:28] account
[18:30] I mean it's God just got a he's just got
[18:32] a day right here this is the 23rd and
[18:34] we're going to that's the day I'm going
[18:36] to come right there now he knows what
[18:38] day it is but it's when you and I are at
[18:42] our Apex
[18:44] of of Readiness in other words when we
[18:47] are at our
[18:49] peak of Readiness how why would you wait
[18:54] why would you go out and the corn has
[18:56] just a few ears on it and it don't have
[18:57] any kernels and you just start cutting
[18:59] it down no you have to wait till it
[19:01] matures why cuz all the fruit has come
[19:05] to its full
[19:06] potential don't cut the beans
[19:09] down if it's just like
[19:12] this you know don't cut the beans down
[19:15] let the beans mature then Harvest what
[19:18] then reap all that that you that you
[19:20] that you've sewn so what we come to here
[19:23] and we look at this the for
[19:25] seal to me is we have reached the Apex
[19:29] of what we need on this Earth to go on a
[19:32] Rapture cuz if a Rapture happens on the
[19:35] four seal guess what somebody's got to
[19:37] be ready that's right there has to be a
[19:39] resurrection in here somewhere amen so
[19:43] the fourth seal is the resurrection and
[19:45] the Rapture cuz the next thing we're
[19:46] looking at is what the resurrection not
[19:47] the Rapture amen that's right
[19:50] Resurrection we need to start thinking
[19:52] that when you know it's okay to sing
[19:54] I'll see you in the Rapture and I'll see
[19:55] you over there and you sing that that's
[19:57] okay MH but there's got to be a
[20:00] resurrection first yes there will never
[20:03] be a Rapture without a
[20:05] resurrection never we will not take a
[20:08] Rapture without the all the saints back
[20:11] with us okay that's
[20:14] right so what we got to do is is make
[20:16] whatever the strength is in that sixth
[20:19] Dimension we got to make it in this
[20:21] Dimension that way the two pull
[20:24] together and that Dimension is done away
[20:26] with cuz you know what once they all
[20:28] come here the Six Dimensions empty right
[20:30] that's right there's nobody else in
[20:32] it right there okay so they may be
[20:35] compartments we've already talked about
[20:37] that foolish version but to me just to
[20:40] put it on the bottom line the sixth
[20:41] Dimension is the perfect love brother
[20:44] R's talking about everyone that has the
[20:46] New Birth from the day of Pentecost to
[20:50] the day we go home is that all right and
[20:53] every one of them is going to come here
[20:56] right into this Dimension there they're
[20:58] going to take a body chain get their
[21:01] bodies then we which are alive and
[21:04] remain shall be changed and then we'll
[21:07] all be caught up why why are we going to
[21:09] be caught up because it's
[21:12] finished it's done for the Gentile
[21:14] dispensation that's right there's no
[21:16] Gentiles to be saved after the r when we
[21:19] see when we see the dead Saints Walk
[21:21] Among Us brother Tatum the Tom the Gary
[21:25] the Richard when we see them walk among
[21:27] us it's done
[21:29] that's the way I see it if it's not it's
[21:31] within a few days it's just that
[21:32] transition remember there's always a
[21:34] little bit of a lap over but when we see
[21:36] when we when it's revealed to us that
[21:38] the dead Saints have come Among Us how
[21:40] can anybody else be saved that's right
[21:43] how I I just don't see that the door
[21:45] will be
[21:46] shut and you know God will have a
[21:48] powerful Church to propit in God said
[21:50] well what is a powerful Church the most
[21:52] powerful Church in the world was Jesus
[21:53] standing that day when he said Lazarus
[21:55] come for amen right cuz brother R said
[21:57] if he had said he said all them dead
[21:59] saints were to rais exactly how powerful
[22:02] is that and then when he said I am the
[22:04] resurrection and the life let's go back
[22:06] to our little illustration when he says
[22:08] I am the resurrection and the life then
[22:11] we say well we're not
[22:14] much what he got we got that's
[22:19] right the Saints will only resurrect
[22:22] through a live message someone has to be
[22:26] alive that's right why I Seek You the
[22:29] living among these dead
[22:32] people
[22:33] right
[22:36] yeah before
[22:38] you yeah u i remember you mentioned
[22:42] something was it two sunds ago or
[22:45] something like that you talk about the
[22:47] resurrection and there being a
[22:50] consecutiveness of for example we're not
[22:53] going to we're not going to raise like
[22:56] Martin Luther because that was that was
[22:59] our age right it's the people in our age
[23:01] and then what about the what about
[23:03] Martin Luther well brother said it would
[23:05] be a worldwide Resurrection remember the
[23:07] Bible says there' be some one in the bed
[23:08] and one in the field that means that
[23:09] there's uh the dark side of the earth
[23:12] which is the night and the daylight well
[23:14] see Martin Luther is not going to raise
[23:16] in the United States right that's why um
[23:21] help me somebody that's why Joseph said
[23:23] don't leave my bones down here in Egypt
[23:26] he said take me to Palestine brother
[23:29] Brown said they he knew that's where the
[23:30] res well that's where Martin Luther's
[23:32] Resurrection no I don't think we'll see
[23:33] Martin Luther till we get all together
[23:36] to go home okay I think we'll see our
[23:38] group right why would we know Even sanki
[23:42] Calvin finny why would we know them
[23:44] we're going to know the people we know
[23:46] you're not going to see Martin Luther
[23:48] recogniz them no we would not no and
[23:51] they are what Born Again under Martin
[23:53] Luther's age they actually at that
[23:56] moment this is the way I say it
[23:59] will not be at the fullness of the
[24:00] Revelation like the ones that stand for
[24:02] the body change so they wouldn't be able
[24:05] to they sure they can communicate I
[24:06] believe what's going to happen we all
[24:08] get to the Future home we know there's
[24:10] we're going to that's what we going to
[24:11] talk about for an eternity that's right
[24:14] Martin Luther right and all Martin
[24:16] Luther's people okay are going to come
[24:18] to you and me not making us anything but
[24:21] they're going to say how in the world
[24:22] did you put all this together that's
[24:24] right well we had a prophet coming in
[24:26] time we're going to tell what we're
[24:28] going to tell a story and it won't be a
[24:30] story no it'll be the truth of your life
[24:33] I mean you take hey if you take seven
[24:36] say There's 7 billion people on this
[24:38] Earth if you just sat down and listen to
[24:40] everybody's everybody say we're all 7
[24:42] billion people of
[24:43] Christian it take sever hundred thousand
[24:46] years just to listen to something
[24:47] especially Aaron he'd be another he'd be
[24:49] a couple million years talking about him
[24:51] first get to be quiet talk about
[24:53] somebody else anyway but you you
[24:56] understand what I'm saying so you take a
[24:58] whole Earth of seven b that long yeah
[25:02] know I know we'll be in eternity brother
[25:04] so won't matter okay but
[25:07] um right but I mean what what do you
[25:11] we're just going to sit there and just
[25:13] say oh this is so
[25:15] pretty oh look that's a pretty bird no
[25:17] we're going to talk to each other right
[25:20] tell the Redemption
[25:21] story tell the Redemption story to
[25:24] somebody else go talk to um Columbus age
[25:27] where all they done is give their life
[25:29] you know you meet a woman that they tore
[25:30] her baby out and killed her for her
[25:32] stand for the gospel she didn't know one
[25:35] thing about one God what a baptism in
[25:36] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ cuz it
[25:38] was all under trinitarian she didn't
[25:40] know one thing about the seal she didn't
[25:42] know one thing about what we
[25:45] know amen right well why can't we tell
[25:49] her about that that's right tell her
[25:51] about how that that she come under the
[25:55] ox age yes M and made it through because
[26:01] of that man Jesus
[26:03] Christ the
[26:05] Redeemer what a wonderful time I mean M
[26:08] that's just and that don't make nothing
[26:11] out of us but when we come to the apex
[26:14] of the word of God there's no man ever
[26:15] come to that except Jesus Christ William
[26:18] brandom and the bride that's
[26:21] all and I say that with humbleness
[26:24] because this age but remember this age
[26:28] brother and it takes all four combat be
[26:30] for us to get through this age it only
[26:31] took one for them to get through the OD
[26:33] age they gave their life for the gospel
[26:36] listen people there was no Bible during
[26:38] that time they had to it was all by
[26:40] either written down what somebody said
[26:43] because the Bible didn't come into view
[26:45] until Martin Luther's time the written
[26:47] bible putting all together right I mean
[26:50] the Catholics had the Latin Vulgate but
[26:51] what did they do with it they shut it up
[26:53] and kept it they read it to the people
[26:54] when they wanted to but if you didn't
[26:56] understand
[26:57] Latin you you were left
[26:59] out that's why the Bible says they
[27:01] without us that's correct but it's not
[27:05] that what it's talking about to me is
[27:07] the revelation of the word that we have
[27:09] that's correct yeah it's not there
[27:12] listen if they're in the sixth Dimension
[27:13] they're in Perfection that's right
[27:16] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[27:17] thou shalt be saved they believe that
[27:19] Jesus Christ is their savior that's what
[27:20] they needed in this age right here M
[27:24] believe that what Columba preached cuz
[27:27] they had to come in under their m
[27:28] Messenger right that was it that was all
[27:33] they probably didn't live very long if
[27:35] it killed 68
[27:37] million Protestants in 1500 years that's
[27:41] a lot of death you didn't live a long
[27:43] time back then so what a glorious time
[27:47] and it's not going to make us that but
[27:48] still even Paul even Paul's he's like
[27:52] man I I could see the the end of the
[27:55] year age but I I really couldn't
[27:57] understand how how that guy
[27:58] there I look through a glass dark but
[28:01] you know what he always says though he
[28:03] turns and says but I see Jesus see I see
[28:05] the Redeemer always go back to that
[28:07] Redeemer if you ever have a problem go
[28:08] to Redeemer cuz when you say Redeemer
[28:10] I'll don't know one thing for sure when
[28:11] you talk about a redeemer I was lost and
[28:15] whoever that man was he put his life
[28:17] inside of me right and Raised Me Up
[28:20] redeemed me and I'm sitting in Heavenly
[28:22] places to me that makes it real simple
[28:24] if you'll take it right down to that
[28:26] word Redeemer because what is the seals
[28:29] for Redemption that's right the seals
[28:32] was not given just to be a mystery that
[28:34] we can say we know more than you do
[28:36] that's right cuz what people in the
[28:38] messages made it so mysterious till they
[28:41] shut it back up and put the seal back on
[28:43] it and said you can't get it unless I
[28:45] open the seal for you how pitiful is
[28:49] that that's why the prophet of God gave
[28:51] his
[28:52] life to get this gospel out he you know
[28:56] family friends he didn't have hard but
[28:58] he got this gospel out so that me and
[29:00] you can be here
[29:02] today and we have more clarity right not
[29:06] that we've added to not that we've taken
[29:07] from but we have more clarity of what
[29:09] the Bible's talking
[29:10] about I was sitting this morning I'll
[29:13] tell you a little experience I sat this
[29:14] morning and I was reading in
[29:17] Corinthians and just for a second I mean
[29:20] just for a split second I believe I was
[29:22] with Paul okay when he was writing to
[29:25] the Corinthians okay cuz I was reading
[29:27] he was talking about you know I I've
[29:29] come to talk to you and and I've come to
[29:31] tell you this about this Christ and I've
[29:34] come to do this and you Corinthians oh
[29:37] he's you you eat stuff made to idols and
[29:40] and I could just see myself sitting
[29:41] there or see Paul not myself but Paul I
[29:43] could just see Paul like he's sitting
[29:45] there in jail and he's writing and what
[29:47] is he doing he's writing his
[29:49] thoughts he's writing his experience he
[29:51] had with the
[29:52] Corinthians that's
[29:54] right he lived it that's right but what
[29:57] did God do God thought so much about it
[29:59] till now it's Eternal Word of God so
[30:02] it's an experience that will last for an
[30:04] eternity in other words what I'm saying
[30:06] so if you got the Holy Ghost Paul's got
[30:08] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost speaks
[30:09] to you then I've always said if you got
[30:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're the
[30:13] only person that can understand what
[30:14] this is all about because you have the
[30:16] person that wrote it hold
[30:19] on you have the person that wrote it
[30:21] inside of you yes that's right am we're
[30:25] not a lesser
[30:26] form we got to start realizing that
[30:29] we're not a lesser form than God Paul
[30:31] didn't even knew that Paul wasn't a
[30:33] lesser form of
[30:35] God
[30:37] no cuz Paul's the one that said ARs and
[30:40] join ARS right he understood that
[30:43] whatever Christ got there in Romans 8
[30:45] whatever Christ got we got that's right
[30:47] all right all right so let's read this
[30:49] still now what I want you to see one
[30:50] more time we're going to go through one
[30:52] 2 3 and 4 which we've covered almost
[30:55] here then it's going to be a Rapture mhm
[30:58] but now you got to take five six and
[31:00] seven
[31:01] before some of you came in five six and
[31:03] seven you've got to take back actually
[31:06] do away with number seven that doesn't
[31:08] sound good does it but
[31:11] anyway seven is right here it's the
[31:14] whole it's the whole seal right he is
[31:18] the seal amen he broke the seal when he
[31:21] come out of that tomb he broke that seal
[31:23] prophet of God said he broke the Seal of
[31:25] death do we believe that got to
[31:28] start but five and six has got to lap
[31:31] back over into here cuz we got to take
[31:34] what this is not just the Redemption of
[31:36] your soul this is redemption of your
[31:40] body
[31:42] right and we know it's a process right
[31:46] to get your soul redeemed there's a
[31:48] process to get your body redeemed
[31:49] there's a process so when we get into 56
[31:51] and
[31:52] seven let's look at how that God comes
[31:55] to the outside of the man okay
[31:57] [Applause]
[31:59] through spiritual understanding that's
[32:02] right not just that number fifth seal is
[32:04] the souls under the altar the 144,000
[32:08] plus the are the ones killed before the
[32:10] 144,000 the Jews right fif SE Jew is the
[32:15] souls under the altar crying how long
[32:17] excuse me how long to avenge our blood
[32:19] so we know that's not
[32:21] Christians but there's a there's an
[32:23] understanding in that seal that you and
[32:26] I got to have that's right okay and
[32:28] we'll we'll talk about it later on but
[32:29] we got to get through this for seal
[32:30] first okay now I'm going to erase all
[32:34] this scribbling
[32:36] here but everybody got that when we get
[32:38] to the four seal we've gone home we have
[32:41] come to a
[32:44] situation that no man has come to except
[32:49] Jesus Christ
[32:52] okay so here let's go let's look at the
[32:55] symbols and then we'll I got to go hook
[32:56] brother Chris up and when he had
[32:59] opened brother Chris said he called his
[33:01] wife last night and he said he said
[33:03] honey how how are they cuz you know you
[33:05] get a new guy come in you don't know
[33:06] whether
[33:08] we're
[33:10] weird weirdly legal weirdly legalist or
[33:14] whatever you know so he said honey he
[33:16] said she said said I told her last night
[33:18] I said honey they have Easter egg hunts
[33:20] like we
[33:23] do so he has no problem with that
[33:29] will enjoy he's I he went with me
[33:31] yesterday to take a beehive out of a
[33:33] tree so he he got a
[33:36] baptism yeah he stayed away he didn't
[33:39] get stoned but he was with me when I
[33:40] when I got out of the tree he wanted to
[33:42] go so we took but when he had opened the
[33:45] fourth
[33:46] seal I heard the voice of the fourth
[33:48] Beast say come and see so what voice is
[33:51] that the voice of the eagle anointing
[33:54] the prophetic topof thee line this is
[33:58] not double A Durham baseball this is
[34:03] Atlanta Braves I'm talking about major
[34:05] league if you want to put it in that
[34:07] category this is when you come the words
[34:10] back in power the problem is the word
[34:11] never lost its power the effect of the
[34:13] word lost his power on the people okay
[34:16] it's the effect that man has what man
[34:19] has put so much of an idea around it
[34:22] till it's not been able to work because
[34:24] the word only works in people right the
[34:27] word not you can print 65 billion
[34:30] message books 6500
[34:34] billion Bibles right won't take you
[34:38] nowhere that's right won't take you
[34:41] nowhere right but when that word comes
[34:43] alive inside of you amen and you can
[34:45] speak back to that word cuz Jesus was
[34:48] what the word made flesh so you and I
[34:50] going to have to do the word made flesh
[34:52] so say eagle or prophetic anointing all
[34:54] right I looked and behold a Pale Horse
[34:56] now what do we say the pale was was
[34:58] mixed it's a mixture of
[35:02] red um of U red black I missed one white
[35:08] red and black all right white red and
[35:09] black mixed up together um uh not a good
[35:13] look at color but you have to look at it
[35:15] on the wonderful side of it that when
[35:17] you mix the true justification true
[35:19] sanctification true baptism of the Holy
[35:20] Ghost you're going to come to an
[35:22] understanding of the word like no one
[35:23] else would come to when you mix all this
[35:26] together now now God a separator but he
[35:29] does mix these together yes okay all
[35:32] right to what to form the word made
[35:35] flesh right that's what we're looking
[35:41] for I say that's what we're looking that
[35:44] all right and then there's a name s on
[35:46] him was death and Hell fall power was
[35:48] given unto them over the fourth part of
[35:49] the earth kill the sword the hunger with
[35:50] death with the Beast of the Earth all
[35:53] right his name that set on him was death
[35:56] and hell so there's a name name comes
[35:58] under
[35:59] this and then we have to look and see
[36:01] that the four
[36:03] seal is
[36:05] the
[36:08] um this
[36:10] part The
[36:12] Headstone connecting back with the
[36:16] church going to pull them out of the
[36:17] ground and we going to go home okay so
[36:20] that's what's going just let that Force
[36:22] seal just read it a couple of times read
[36:24] your Force seal that brother R preached
[36:26] on the force steal read that next Sunday
[36:29] and then what we'll do is we'll start
[36:31] Matthew 24 and read that and then we'll
[36:34] go forward so let's go
[36:37] [Music]
