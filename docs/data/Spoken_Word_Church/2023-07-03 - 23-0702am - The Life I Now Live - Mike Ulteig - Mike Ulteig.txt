I said well surprised it'll be 53 of us up there but we're going to pitch in and help amen help so God bless you let's let's sing Open the Eyes of My Heart Is brother Mike Alton most of you know him he's been he's been around here for a long time about as much as his church house he's at his own church there since 76 I believe good to have such a Janet and they're one of their uh sisters with us from the church Sister Janet doesn't get out much so it's good to see her I get to see her when I go down there but she's up here where she can see all y'all that's his better half that's the part that's the wheel so this thing Open the Eyes of My Heart brother Michael Teague from Beech Island South Carolina there ain't no beach around ain't no Island around it's b-e-e-c-a's beach trees Beach Island go that long way from the beach but God bless you let's say Open the Eyes of My Heart as our brother comes Open the Eyes of My Heart [Music] I want to see you that's yours [Music] thank you Chinese [Music] pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy [Music] holy holy holy Lord You Are Holy Holy Holy Lord [Music] bless you Lord God Amen let's sing it one more time okay [Music] [Music] well I want to see you [Music] in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing [Music] in the light of your glory pour out your power and love holy holy holy [Music] name is amen thank you very much amen praise the Lord well it's good to be standing up here alive and some of you don't even know it but you probably come closer to crossing the portals of time than I have but God was with you and spared you you know there's no telling how many times that death has come to our gates and knocking at the door God has forbidden to come in amen so it's I'm glad to be here throw my shoulder to the to the wheel with brother Samuel and and brother Wade amen and all of you and I enjoyed the service last night glad you was here this morning I didn't know Hallelujah you know how those things are going to turn out but God's grace just real glad to have my wife with me been up here a lot of times without her and you know when you when you travel even States or overseas you know people want to see your wife more than they want to see you and you know I'm the same way I always want to meet somebody's somebody's wife you know it's just I don't know there's just something about that and sister Debbie we've been knowing her for years back in the 80s and she's with us this morning we're just really glad to have her so that's the crowd we brought you know so glad you had extra seats for us [Laughter] praise the Lord [Music] Let's uh let's read a scripture and then I'll let you be seated I want to turn to Galatians chapter 2. and uh I guess we'll read verses 19 and 20. for I through the law am dead to the law [Music] that I that word that is always an important word when you read it because that is kind of like a conclusion of what's just been said and and what's just been said is maybe in an event or something that has a purpose to it I opened the door that I might go into the kitchen you know and so this word that is important he said for the I through the law am dead to the law that I might live now that's always a contrast death in life amen you know I'm glad that I'm dead so that I can live amen so uh we'll be glad when we cross the portals that we might live in Clarity without a veil that I might live unto God not onto myself no sir self-purpose self needs you know but that I might live for God Amen and he said how can you love me and not love my children so then to live for him is to live for one another you know it's easy to live for God he's up here somewhere you know the Holy Spirit but sometimes we fail to live for one another and that's the truth that's what God really wants us and that's that's the simplest but it's the hardest because in order for you to live for somebody else you've got to take and put yourself out of the way and it's that's always hard to do sometimes we serve others for reward or for something for ourselves you know and God's love God's work is free it's without an ulterior purposes it's flowing from a well like an Artesian well amen there's something down deep a pressure that's pushing it up verse 20 and this is where we want to maybe the Lord willing to take a text yes Lord and here we are again we're dying already I am crucified with Christ nevertheless Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me amen and the life which I now live in the flesh and that's not after the flesh this is in the flesh I live by the faith of the son of God Who Loved Me and gave himself for me as we bow our heads those gracious Heavenly Father were just so glad to be here this morning that you granted all of us Lord another opportunity another day that we might learn of you that we might get to know you and Lord to understand you and your word in a greater depth a greater way and Lord you just know I'm just standing here this morning not certain as to which way I should go so we're we're asking you for for divine leadership yes in every one of our hearts and Minds this morning that you might anoint us that you might break any yoke any Fetter that would hinder us any thought anything that we're facing or challenges Lord may we set them aside and set at your feet Lord and may you speak to us may you inspire us Lord that you might reveal to us yourself your word and your way and father may you bless each one that's come this morning bless our gathering together and bless the reading of your word we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated so I guess we'll take from this a text the life I now live and uh brother Wade already preached the message to me because he didn't already preached it in several parts you know so uh it wouldn't be anything new amen but Paul's speaking here and this is about 30 years or so after Paul's converted so he's not he's not really a young convert 30 30 years of Paul's life from the time he was converted is pretty active yeah a lot of experiences good and bad and and so now we know he's writing to the to the Galatians and they're kind of in the same situation that we see in Acts 15. where the church at Antioch which is not an infant Church it's a church that that was begun when when Paul was in his ministry under the law and he was persecuting the church and and going house to house and and Scattered the church abroad and they went everywhere preaching the word now that was the first missionaries amen was the church not the apostles they stayed they stayed in Jerusalem it said the church was scattered abroad and went everywhere preaching the word and the apostles stayed in Jerusalem so if he writes another book of Acts you all got some missionary work to do and uh missionary work in the beginning wasn't overseas missionary work was local but we've made it kind of an overseas thing and then we've made anybody that steps on an airplane or a boat or something and goes overseas they're on missionary work or a missionary and that's that's not always true [Music] but um so he's he's 30 years and and so this church like I said like Antioch they was they were an established church they were established when the church was scattered abroad there were some that went up to Antioch and the way the churches started was that people were testifying of what had happened into their lives hey man and when they did uh they didn't have Bibles and tracks they only could talk about the gospel that had been preached to them and the experience that they had had and and when those that believe their testimony uh and repented and were baptized they were filled with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit was the center of their Gathering it wasn't a building and and it wasn't a Ministry so much but it was it was the resurrected Christ it was the new life that they had in common and now it was it was starting an exploration of this new kingdom this new life that they were in and and so that they were established early on and then after Paul was converted that uh Barnabas went and got Paul and brought him back over to Antioch and they began to establish the church and I think it was maybe a year or two years three years and Paul now has been converted I think maybe 10 to 12 years and and these things are kind of interesting when you're trying to get a picture in your mind of what's taken place how long this has been and sometimes you read one page and go to the next page and there may be years separating it and you're reading it like hours apart you know and and so then the church was was established like this church amen it was it had a Teaching Ministry they had Barnabas he was considered to be a prophet and he was a faithful man he was chosen by the pillars in Jerusalem to go up and and to establish that church they had confidence in his ministry and in his character and amen and then uh when he when he got to the church and began preaching and looking at the things that was circled about him he he thought about Paul and I think he was related to Paul distantly and so then he went and he he recruited Paul and and come back and you know uh God had called Paul on the road to Damascus right amen and he had commissioned him and told him that he was going to suffer a lot of things for him [Music] you know he wasn't talking about cruises and airplanes and five-star hotels and you know like some of the missionaries today you know really rough it you know but um so it was about 10 12 years now he'd been pastoring this church along with Barnabas probably about a year year and a half two years and now God is going to send him out he's he called him but now it's been 10 years or so and now he's sending him Hallelujah you know it wasn't just an overnight thing no sir sometimes sometimes you know we we feel a calling and and we're out the next day and but you know things with God takes time because he's not a creature at times so he ain't worried about time you and I are the ones that's worried about timing that's why every Church AIDS they were looking for the Rapture in their age we're looking we're looking to step across we're looking at the news we're looking at the atmosphere we're looking at prophecy we're looking at we're looking at everything and it and it's just so intimate it just it just seems like we're standing on the on the cliff on the precipice and we're just about to step off into this dimension of I'll Fly Away and we're looking at everything we're looking at the ministry we're looking how the preaching is is pulling and focusing within the rims of the Bride we're looking out at the United States we see this this religious thirst for God you know I was looking at Asbury and I thought you know there's one thing about this people are coming from all over the states I think from overseas and they're standing in line for a mile to uh a long distance just to get in into this college into this atmosphere where the holy spirit is just falling and and they're just worshiping and praising and they're just they're hungering and thirsting for the reality of a living God man there's no word they're not preaching repentance but it's a it's an atmosphere or a spirit of worship amen you know when the two churches came together in the Book of Genesis when when Adam and and when Cain or Abel and Cain or Abel and Cain when they came together at the first church meeting it was about worship they came to worship God they came to present their offerings they they came to worship and one was accepted and one wasn't but it shows us that there's a genuine thirst in this country amen amen I was reading about a young girl on it was on the news and she was a valedictorian and she gave a a speech there where she was the valedictorians always give a speech when they graduate and she started talking about Jesus Christ you know that forbidden word that forbidden name now if somebody got up there and cursed and used his name in vain you know they they wouldn't blip it out they wouldn't do anything they'd just go right on but now to give glory to that name or to speak Redemptive properties in that name or religiously to refer to that name that's that's almost against the law it will be before long exactly right and and there was such a she was talking about if you go out and no matter whether you're successful or unsuccessful she said it's she said his strength Jesus's strength is made perfect through our weakness and she was talking about Christ and oh it and and they responded to such an internet responded it was a a positive overwhelming response this country the book of uh Hosea or Amos it said they would go from sea to Sea come on and they'd go from North to the east to seek a word of the Lord they wouldn't find it but it said they would be seeking they wouldn't be seeking intellectual things they wouldn't be seeking colleges they wouldn't be seeking scientific understanding but they would be seeking a word of God and not be able to find it so somebody is seeking for a word from God and can't find it man it's like when we was here the last time in his light shall we see light David he thirsted for God Psalms 42 my soul thirsts for God he must have thought about that a second because he said for a living God it's just interesting the way that things are are written into the scriptures and it's all with a purpose there's no Idle Word in the scriptures and David said my soul thirsts for God a living God now what's the difference between God and a living God well uh a God could be a totem pole it could be a piece of wood it could be a god up somewhere in another dimension up above the clouds or somewhere something that would maybe be intangible or or something that you couldn't really commune with but God was so real to David that a living God speaks of a communion it speaks of a relationship it is and that's what he wanted with God he said oh he said I go to church with the Believers I I sing with all the Believers we sing the the songs of joy and worship and the glory of God and he said I come away and there's tears in my eyes why am I crying I just came from church but there's there's tears in my eyes because he was looking for that presence of God the reality reality of a living God that's David's whole life that's why when he was enthroned and he was sit upon the throne over the 12 tribes the first thing he he wanted to do he he went up and he and he conquered there was a citadel on Mount Zion I think it was uh it might have been the Philistines or somebody had a had a fortress up there and in the days of the judges in the days of Saul nobody could take that Fortress nobody could break those seals but David of the line of the tribe of Judah he went up and he took that Citadel and there became the city of David it was to there that he brought the ark they found a a temporary resting place which was a type of the Gentiles because in there there was no sacrifices and any priest could go into the presence of the Ark in the Tabernacle of David it was a symbol of the of the Gentile Church during the church ages amen and anybody could go in and they had recorders in there because when any priest went in the inspiration struck him and and David when he when he brought that heat he stood in that moment he stood he stood as Melchizedek there it is he was never a priest but he stood in the position of a priest because when he brought the ark he thought Lord I want you in the middle of the people I want you to be the center of the people so David's love for God brought God into the presence he wanted him to be the king he wanted him to be the one that was worshiped it was God that David wanted to unveil down in that Valley that day the God that he knew that Israel didn't know they stood there they knew about him but they didn't know him and there stood a giant down there challenging them man and David said all that all of Israel and all the nations would know that there is a living God in the midst of Israel he came down to unveil God he didn't come down to be a champion he came down to unveil God to the people but when the people got back when the church got back they said oh Saul has slayed a thousand and David ten thousand they only found another champion I think sometimes in this message people have only found another hero another champion another great uh patriarch a great man but he come to unveil God to the people he come to unveil Christ to the people and I think that's what we we miss it sometimes brother good preaching so I thought anniversary okay so anniversary sometimes we we pull out the photo albums and then we go back come on this is a picture of the day we got married here so then you know how photo albums family photo albums sometimes you go oh after book five you start getting a little bit weary you know and and the host is going oh here's another one right here and you're going another one really you know and and so then brother Wade was giving us a little uh photo album view of what it was when we used to come here together and before all the remodeling and things and and so then there was kind of two lives of the assembly here the building sort of to speak you know there was the the old church and and listen it got pretty cold out here in the in the winter time I guess some of y'all know that it was a long trip up those steps I mean the wind was blowing and just the whole goodness and you'd get in here and of course the heaters would be fired up and and from the ceiling down to about the waist it was hotter than a firecracker but the floor up it was colder than Iceberg you could look down there and see if anything was down there you know and then there was the Outhouse right uh all those modern conveniences of the day you know but we didn't care we come to worship we come to hear the word of God you know these things are nice they're comfortable you know it'd be hard to sit outside now and all the humidity and just so these things are nice but they're not the most important thing no sir there it is so Paul said the life that I now live so then there was a life that he lived previously and and then when he uh I I started looking at some of his his testimonies and the first time we find in the book of Acts I think it's chapter nine that that he rehearses the events as they happen it's more a chronological as I guess he's telling Luke you know and he's reminiscing and Lucas writing these things down and so Luke writes that in in the ninth chapter and then I think it's the 26th chapter it's a it's a testimony to Agrippa and he he goes into a little bit different uh same events but it's just a little bit different and he's doing it he's he's saying I thought this was a paradox amen he said I stand Here In Chains for the hope of Israel yeah think about that you know the bride one day will stand in Chains yeah for the hope of the church amen come on because the whole is is to look for a Revival of restoration that's that's what's sweeping this country there's a hunger and there's a thirst and I got to thinking you know you know the the bride she has a Ministry and the foolish virgin will have a Ministry in that tribulation period it looks like to me that the foolish virgin is receiving a call there it is brother she's hungering and thirsting for the oil we know that was way back in brother branham's day but listen they've got to come to a position because they that are righteous will remain righteous amen they've got they're not it's not some kind of great Revival they're going to have during the tribulation period it's something that's carried across in the ark of their hearts we're carried up they're carried in but there will be a Ministry because she be slain for the word of God for faith so look how close that we are look at the messages we find that people are speaking more than ever about about the third poll about speaking the word and and I personally believe it's going to be just like when was here the last time I was talking to you about Hope becoming faith and how that that Sarah down there in chapter 18 of Genesis that how that she was when I read over in in the 11th chapter of Hebrews in the in the 11th verse it says and Sarah also by faith receives strength dunamis that she might conceive seed but you know in in Genesis 18 that was the son of man revealing himself to the church Abraham had already recognized him but Sarah hadn't recognized him and she laughed when she when he said you're going to have a child so that wasn't Revel that wasn't Hebrews 11 11 yet because she was laughing at him but it was it was God revealing himself to her you know you've got to meet him yourself amen you've got to know the guaranteer of the promise it's one thing to know the promise but it's another thing to know the guaranteer of that promise you know when you buy things and you find there's a warranty you say well what company is backing this up come on is it some notable company is it some company has been around for a long time or is it some company I've never heard of and are they even proven do they even back up their guarantee and then some guarantees you know you buy this watch for twenty dollars they made it for about two bucks and it's got a lifetime warranty and you're always sending it back in of course when you send it in it cost you 15 or 20 dollars to get your free one back and they've already made their money to give you about 10 or 15 of them so that warranty really ain't much good amen so then God is a guaranteer of his promises by two immutable things by his word and by himself he's sworn to us that he would come back and receive us unto himself and now that hope is becoming Faith but then we find that her body was changed she recognized God in human flesh and she recognized that she had met that God in that guaranteer and now she could say like Abraham according to Hebrews 11 11 she said he is able to fulfill that promise because she had met him it's one thing to read the book it's another thing to meet the author in your life and Paul was pointing back to a life he had previously lived in Galatians 1 he says you know what I was I persecuted the church and and all but now now he he had given his life to serve God something had changed in his life something back there there was an event somewhere listen it wasn't when he met him on the road to Damascus that wasn't the change that was an event amen that was an attraction amen that was the meeting of the guaranteer but he hadn't taken up residence yet but all when he went back into that City and then the agabus came and spoke to him and laid hands on him and scales fell from his eyes and he was filled with the Holy Ghost that was a change I remember back when we first were converted every one of us if if we if we're truly born again every one of us ought to be able to say the life that I used to live there it is the life that I now live amen you know did we join a church or we joined a group of people or is it was it something with you as an individual uh did something really happen to you has it been tested there it is brother time-tested Memorial God didn't want memorials up here on the billboard he didn't want monuments down here in the graveyard he didn't want statues in the middle of the city he wanted living memorials time tested there it is we was in our living room or in the kitchen and we're sitting at a dining room table and there was an event that taken place in my wife and my life and from that time you know I can't remember going repenting and asking Jesus to be my savior but there was a there was an event amen there was a lot of crime amen and didn't know why I was crying drove to work that day I was working a swing shift it was three o'clock why am I crying it's not in crime about a month after I was saved had a man come up to me a Baptist man he said Mike he said I want you to come over here I want to talk to you I said okay he said you know in this in this one month that you've been saved here on this plant he said you've had more of an impact on this plant than I have in the three or four years I've been working here a Baptist think about that but you know he never asked me what happened no no and I never knew that there was a change right right because I was going to church me and my wife we lived for Wednesday we lived for Sunday that was bad it was on we had our other routines but this was our whole life it was something something brand new right and and I was reading the messages and listening to tapes I'm a reader and I just all my time just reading and then one day you know somebody asked me a question and I went to answer it and I realized I knew a lot about the message but I hadn't been reading my Bible come on now you know we we got this is the absolute you better believe it right the seal book is not the absolute this is the absolute the church age book is not the absolute this is the absolute this is the book that's going to judge this generation God sent a prophet he didn't send the message for salvation we've had salvation since the day of Pentecost we've had salvation since the day that Christ was crucified and was rose again and the gospel began to be preached in Jerusalem and throughout the world but what this message did was to separate yeah it was a calling out it didn't come to make a separation a denomination it came to call the people to reach down to Open the Eyes of the heart David said sin thy light thy light don't send a light send thy light and thy truth that it might lead me to thy Tabernacles amen you know they're wanting to find him job wanted to find him amen he said if I knew where his throne was if I knew where his seat was I'd go there and I knock I got questions I'd like to talk to him about you know God had revealed to job it revealed to him that there was a forgiveness of sin through the shedding of blood amen Amen brother Brown said he was a prophet and he looked up into the stars and the Holy Spirit revealed to job through those constellations that there was the forgiveness of sin through the shedding of blood think about that and it said that job offered up a sacrifice for his children in case they had had committed a secret sin so the sacrifice that he was offering was for sin amen so he knew that there was an atonement that's why God could look down and say he's perfect he's upright in his generation it didn't mean that he was of a good behavior it didn't mean that he was of a correct character it didn't mean that his neighbors loved him and he was the most perfect man it meant that God was looking at him through the Revelation that he had revealed to him and you know that shedding of that blood didn't do one thing for him it didn't do one thing for his children it was the expression of the Revelation that he had and it was The Obedience of faith that caused the sacrifice he was forgiven by faith he was justified through faith not sacrifice but there was a question and what happens after I die my sins are forgiven I stand in the presence of God Justified righteous but but what happens when I die oh I just wished I knew where he was I want to ask him this question here there must be something that follows this I see the tree falls I I see it die I see it come back up but what about a man when he dies he said oh I I just want to see him I I want to Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord I want to see your dwelling place I want to find you I want to talk to you and God granted him that he wasn't exactly like he thought he said gird up your loins I'm fixing to talk to you and I'm going to talk to you like a man you know and he said where were you you know he you know oh now you know something I got they're going to open up a seal for you and no he was in the middle of an eye sheep he was looking death right at the gates door and he thought he was dying and he was wondering what happens after death and about that time the London the Thunder flashed and the lightning and he said all that I my words were written and stone that I had Flint to write it in that man could read it and I'm reading it come on now and I'm reading that his wish came true the Whirlwind came and spoke to him and it was revealed to him of the Resurrection that though that I die and the skin worms eat my flesh I'll Stand in this flesh and I'll see my redeemer and not as a stranger not another but I'll see him in this flesh wouldn't he do the same for you God is not respecter as a person David he hungered and thirsted for God and I thought you know I was looking at my life one time and I said seems like there's kind of three phases three steps come on and I said the first step is kind of like Moses in a search for God there it is now maybe just listening to the message or reading the Bible you don't really see Moses so much searching for God you just see a a man running to the backside of the desert that's right but there was a there was a sequel written by Ingram and and one of them was the prince of the House of David and God and brother Branham refers to that and and that was from John the Baptist until the resurrection of Christ it it was told in a little story form but it was bringing all the scriptures together it's a nice book to read if you ever want to read it it's it reads like a novel but yet we find it Ingram he understood the customs and he and he really had a way of finding all the family relationships and bringing that picture together and it just helps you when you go back and read the Bible it just seems like it it's more alive because you're understanding the settings a little bit well he wrote another book and he called it the pillar of Fire and in that book it was Moses and in there that Moses was seeking for God he knew there was a God but like David he he wanted he wanted to meet this God this living God and all of his life sitting in Pharaoh's policy was he was looking for that God and when he ran to the back side of the desert there was still he was one to community he knew that there was a God and there was something there was a seed down inside of him that was reaching out for sunlight it was reaching out for water it was reaching out to God it was thirsting for life and he met him at that bush right listen when he went back down to Egypt it wasn't just go down there like a champion and deliver a people with a stick no sir no sir all his life he had sought for God and he had met him in that bush and now he knew God was a reality he spoke to him he spoke back he went down there to unveil God to the people listen anybody that ever meets God truly meets God what you want to do is unveil that God to people does not becoming champions is not becoming an associate with an important person but it's the no without him and nothing then without him you're nothing and anything that I can do without him is nothing anything that you can do without him is nothing it might be important to the family it might be important to you temporarily but as far as the kingdom of God it's nothing amen amen and it wasn't it wasn't I was trying to think of I was reminded of this a young man was preaching at our church and I'd testified to this this experience that I'd went through but I don't think I'd been saved very long and somewhere between a week and maybe a month and we those were the Happy Days we was going to church reading the word Whole New World it's like walking up to the edge of of the Grand Canyon amen I walked up and I said wow Janet crawled up to the rail and said but it was wow both ways but it was terrifying one way and magnificent another way and God's terribly magnificent and but I was somebody was preaching all right I was reading and over in Matthew uh the 12th 13th chapter 12-13 and and Jesus says to blaspheme the Holy Spirit there's no forgiveness in this life are in the Life to Come and I read that and I was I was a an atheist when me and my wife were saved and an atheist is a is an intellect and nobody's born an atheist no no and nobody's born a Christian no sir we're born pagans but there's a soul in us and we know that there is a God somewhere and so I I heard that or I read it and I said whoa man you talk about empty I thought about the jokes that I told times I'd use the name of the Lord in vain me and my daddy mocked Oral Roberts and made fun of him watching him on TV and just man I thought about those things and I said whoa the blaspheme the Holy Spirit there's no forgiveness I said I said I can't there's no way I can get saved I was kind of like the Antioch Church come on there they was filled with the Holy Spirit born again and somebody comes along and said oh you can't get born again you can't get saved till you get circumcised yeah come on now you got to speak in tongues you got to shake the preacher's hand you got to believe brother Brown's a Prophet come on and I said oh you talk and that was an anointed message from God Amen the devil didn't give me that message and I thought I said well I can't tell Janet I sure ain't gonna tell nobody at the church but I'm just as lost as loss can be I can go to church all my life I can do whatever I want to do and there's no way for me to go to heaven no way to get saved oh I felt so yeah and lost I felt like that young man brother Brown talks about without social disease and was on that boat and he said oh it's getting dark right you talk about getting dark and I thought well I sure like reading this Bible amen and I sure like listening to these tapes and reading this message I sure like that and I sure like going to church and I look back and I didn't see anything I wanted to go back to no sir and I thought well yeah I can't never get saved but I'm going to keep on going to church and I want to tell you God anointed that because it was real to me man amen I'm talking about real and it it went about I don't know how long it went a week two or three days but he left me like that whoa and I'm in here it was inspired sure I started going to church and then one day I was reading in my Bible and and I was reading and Paul said I was a blasphemer of blasphemy I said wait a minute and I got to thinking about what Paul had done he had killed some of those people and caused him and put in jail and all that he did and these and Jesus said thou persecuted me you blasphemed me it was me that you killed I said I started seeing a little bit of light at the end of the time and I see people leaving the word of God leaving the message leaving and going back into the world no I I can't I can't see that no sir you know we we have to have those experiences to be time-tested memorials we have to come to disappointments we have to come to discouragement and and God he's gonna he's Gonna Leave You he's Gonna Leave You without any emotion without any reasoning to give you a little word to stand on you you won't even be able to say Amen to it you won't even be able to raise your hand all you can do is stand on that Solid Rock because there's an affinity there's an attachment to that rock and you believe that in that rock there's Security in that rock there's peace in that rock is life [Music] that life that I now live in contrast pick up the old photo albums right we do that yeah see you standing there with a beer in your hand and cigarette you know out there hunting Easter eggs and all that you know nobody had to tell me to quit doing that no no sir you know I had somebody tell my testimony for me one time and when I got saved I love riding dirt bikes oh I love that bike it was just like a horse to me you know there was a bond we can go up we'd go through the mud we'd go through the sand all go out in the woods and ride it I don't I didn't much care for riding down the highways but now when I met him [Music] and I and I started reading his letters oh my God when I when I met him and started at least listening to his servants that that motorcycle started getting cobwebs Paulson in Philippians 3. he said I suffered the loss of all things that didn't mean that he said oh quit riding bikes I won't do that anymore because I'm gonna live for Christ I'm not going to smoke cigarettes anymore I'm oh I I want to really bad but I'm gonna I'm gonna be a martyr he never gave up nothing if you did you never gave it up when you don't have to give it up and you leave it that's when you gave it up you know when a woman when she when she quits wearing pants and starts wearing a dress when she quits cutting her hair to be part of the message and part of the Believers and you never really became part but when you read that you were sealed onto the day of your Redemption you could cut your hair you could smoke cigarettes you could drink beer you could wear pants you can wear shorts bikinis anything you want to and you're going to heaven then when you quit brother that's when you quit [Music] listen this ain't this ain't a bargaining table this ain't a trade-off he said the life that I now live he said I've been crucified well I wanted to speak a little bit on the old man and the new man you know he talks about the old man the new man you know that's your life that you're now living the new man and the old life that you used to live that's the old man the old man is crucified I put off the old man with his deeds and his conversation see your life has changed the control tower has changed and then there's the Inner Man and the outer man now the outer man's never been crucified it was the old man that was crucified that was that first husband that was that old nature of the world that's what you were when that control tower when your spirit was in Control operating through your five senses and your memory and your emotions but something happened that man died and you got a new man a new birth and then there's an outer man he's getting old he's through wrecks and heart surgery and then there's the Inner Man and he's been strengthened by the power of His might by the spirit of him that created him after the knowledge of him that created him we got the outer man we got the inner man we got the old man we got the new man we got the new creation a new creature that's you as a Triune being yeah man amen amen that's good brother use him Lord let me let me just I just had this kind of on my heart with a bunch of other stones but you'll go to uh Romans 7 for a moment Romans chapter 7. you know this is where most of us a lot of times we struggle right here right here because we got the Holy Ghost we're born again new control tower and yet all the mistakes we made losing our temper you know what I mean just and we struggle I got the Holy Ghost I don't I didn't go to Holy Ghost it was one of my biggest battles when I first come to Christ the intellect he'd come in do you believe brother Brown was a prophet you believe serpent seed you have been baptized in water baptism you got the Holy Ghost I got it I got it and then I'll be somebody maybe still under the shadows of Pentecost you ever spoke in tongues uh no has God ever you ever heard the voice of God uh oh I can't say that I have no I ain't got it and then I got it and then I ain't got it and you had it all the time you had it all the time but not being established there's the key not being established in the word to tell you what happened to you and so then and it doesn't make any difference if you got the Holy Ghost or not if you've got the Holy Ghost I'm taught by truly born again and you don't think you have it the enemy's got a hedge on you because he's going to get you to look for something else and anything else is not the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ has come he's the Messiah if you're looking for a messiah any other Messiah is not the Messiah if you're looking for Malachi 4 to be fulfilled and it's already been fulfilled than any other fulfillment is not Malachi for you got the real and then you've got the counterfeit one real hundreds and thousands of counterfeits we don't want a counterfeit we want the real yeah and then one day as I began to read the message as I begin to read the Bible but especially the message it began to unveil the Holy Spirit to me that was in me and it'd be a personal revelation that's the birth yes right you know you can be born again but then to have the reality I'm not talking about dogmatism I'm talking about experience and being established by the revealed word of God in your heart amen amen there it is the truth brother we got things today that I I don't but it's disappointing to me what people are preaching it has gotten so far from Redemption this is this book yeah come on now this is a book of time this is not a book of Eternity it starts with Genesis and it ends with Revelation it's a book it's a book of redemption but before this book I was yeah Hallelujah after this book I am amen this this is only time yeah right this body is only a Time creature but before this body I was I shouldn't say I am but because I'm a creature of time I'm looking at the past but with God there is no past there is no future there's only the presence but my death is in him my life my birth was in him my whole life is in him all creation is in him because in him he's Timeless so all time is in him everything is in him but we're we're still in we're still in time look over here and if I can do this just real quickly all right in Romans 7. no you're not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth he's setting up a principle amen that's the truth brother man he's he's speaking he's using an allegory to express something and this is this is where the greatest battles in your life trying to understand how your flesh and how your deity how the two comes together I'm talking about whether rubber meets the road I'm not talking about Doctrine that's been taught I'm talking about when you're confronted and you're faced with reality it's going to take more than Doctrine come on now it's going to take Faith for the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is freed from the law so that she so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the whole by the body of Christ amen as the old man that is crucified now crucifixion we're not talking about death crucifixion we're talking about the judgment and then the penalty amen so crucifixion and more than just death it's talking about the Judgment of sin he became sin amen he didn't become sinful he became sin when God looked down on Christ when he hung there at Calvary he looked at sin he was looking at you the life I used to live sin and then he judged that sin exactly right that's good brother crucifixion is just not death it's the Judgment of sin and applying the penalty for True Justice if there's a judgment of guilt and there's no penalty there's no justice so God didn't forgive you and just justify you at the expense of the law no sir God paid that penalty in Christ and you were in him it listen wasn't just proxy it wasn't just representation but he been the fullness of the word and we being attributes were in him and when he was judged you were judged and when he died you died so it said we were crucified we died to the law through the body of Christ so your sins were settled almost 2 000 years ago but we had to accept that that it had to come it had to come to flesh it had to come to repentance it had to come to the Fulfillment of righteousness good good to the law of the body by the body of Christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead Hallelujah that we look we should bring forth fruit so the idea is just not becoming a widow independent free no headship now I can do whatever I want to do but the freedom from the first husband is so that for this reason that I can be married again to him that has risen from the dead Christ that I might bring forth fruit thank you amen you ever thought we're talking about one woman and two husbands think about that you ever you ever thought about Abigail come on there it is look over in first first Samuel first Samuel 25. and I'm not going to read this whole thing I just want to go through it for a second first Samuel I got to find it for Samuel 25. now like the symphony right verses verses 1 through about 17. he's introducing the characters and set in the scene oh Jesus here's Abigail and her husband nabal he's the fool amen he's a rough Man Charlie he cares nothing about anybody but himself there it is and Buddy he's a and and as you read the story you realize that Abigail is married to this man now this is the first husband right amen that's exactly right you study this thing when you go home and then you read you read Romans 7 1 1-4 two husbands one wife amen man beautiful and this first marriage was not really a marriage by choice because when you read about Abigail she's a spiritual woman she's a predestinated seed she would have never chose this man but you see he was rich he had a lot of property a lot of a lot of cattle you know sheep and everything and it was an arranged marriage there it is Mom and Dad said well this is going to be a good Dowry man this guy's got money influence we could you know a little bit with the business ties and things you know and so here she is you know no choice of her own amen you know you didn't have a choice to be born a sinner so I can't wait subscribe bro she had no choice so it's it kind of sets the picture yeah Samuel dies now David is going to go off down here to this wilderness and they say this Wilderness is kind of like a No Man's Land it kind of borders Israel and Palestine and but man has got beautiful grazing and so people they they want to send their sheep out there to graze and to really get healthy and ready for the for the Harvest Time for the shearing of the sheep and the slaughter and and but the bad thing about it there's no law that rules out there it's a wilderness so when they send them out there there's Bandits and guys robbing and stealing sheep so you're really taking a chance but but it's Paradise you know but there's a lot of danger out there you know the greatest the greater the reward sometimes the higher the risk so David's going to go down there because what happens is that sometimes people like David he takes his men down there and and they do the little uh kind of protection thing so they go down there and they they make a living by protecting these sheep and things and and so they go down there and they protect them from the robbers and things and that's the testimony of the of the herders of nabal they said while Wiz out there David was a wall now all right hey nobody touched us all those robbers and bandits roaming around but David and his men as long as we had communion with him as long as we stayed with him it wasn't like uh protection downtown New York I'm not talking about that he was a wall to us and we never lost one sheep he never come and said you owe me a sheep a sheep all that time he protected us Fortress and he comes to the neighbors sends his men said oh if it's a time of harvest it's a time of Plenty you know maybe he got something an old neighbor he's our first husband isn't he better believe it and he says who is this guy he probably heard about him yeah who is this guy I don't know he could be a runaway son a runaway slave I don't know now I ain't getting my money to him I ain't taking fruit out of my servant's mouth and give him he ain't getting nothing oh David a little self-righteousness got in there and you know God's keeping his eye out better believe he does and uh David says I believe this guy treated me like this after all I did and this is the thanks I get yeah all these years I preached and look at how the church treats me yeah come on look at that preacher all that I've done for him and what I've done for the church look how they treat me you know he says well we're going to see something you guys go put on your swords believe it if if there's a male child left if there's anybody left of that family when I get through I'm going to kill them all God was concerned about that you better believe it David had killed a lot of people but it was in for the kingdom it was for Israel it was it was for the it was the enemies of God but this was for his own self-righteousness amen that would have been innocent blood on his hands exactly right it had come to this room yeah now I want you to watch this so now Abigail some of the some of the Shepherds they come to her and they tell her what's happened and we're just setting a scene right this is what step one maybe step two I don't know I meant to write those things down so now beautiful now this is you Abigail is you man that's your soul right first husband so now she learns about David she learns about what's happened so now she comes under the inspiration of almighty God now you don't see it here but it's there because David tells us it's there he sure does so then we find from from down verse 26 she's inspired she she starts getting all the food together she takes and she sends her servants out in front of her and then you have to read about the customs of the time and and she sends she sends the food out and then she comes and then she approaches David and oh David he's hot well you better believe it he's ready to shed a little blood and she gets off and she says I want to tell you something no that's just you this is when you first hear the gospel see now you're you're you're responding something down in here is responding now the old man don't like it no sir the husband he never knew about it and if she'd have told him and he said you can't go she couldn't go but there must have been certain loopholes within the law of headship so then she was able to take this and she was able to go and not break the law she didn't break the law she wasn't an immoral woman she she respected headship and she never broke the law of headship so then she was able to take this sacrifice and she comes to David so then we find that and in verse 27 she brings forth a fruit for repentance now watching this let's go down to verse 27 I just want to read something here hey man man beautiful come on um I want to go down to verse 27. 28. I pray thee forgive the trespass of thy handmaiden see there she didn't blame this on some other soul [Music] he didn't blame this on her her other husband no sir she took she took it on herself you know when he went places she went with him she was her her wife he was her husband but there was places she wanted to go that he wouldn't go yeah she wanted to go to some of the revivals we ain't going to church first husband headship led by the spirit through the senses of the body through memory emotion imagination no faith reasoning come on no faith he didn't like it I pray pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaiden for the Lord will certainly make my Lord a sure house well she prophesying amen she's speaking under inspiration God is moving on her and and look David he's looking and he's saying hey there's something going on here you better believe it kind of like Brother Richard would say there's something going on here you know I don't do that but I like that he don't do it for show that's just that's just that hillbilly wow wow that's good ain't it because that's who he is if I go out trying to be like that I'd be popping my suspenders and everything else I wouldn't be me but I like to be a little bit like him it's like so it's now she says certainly the Lord will certainly make my Lord a sure house isn't that what God said he was going to do with David he was going to make him a sure house and there would always be seed to be on the throne and that was fulfilled in Christ is that right of the Lord and evil hath not sure house because my Lord fighteth the battles of the Lord and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days now watch yet a man is risen in Pursuit Of Thee Saul prophesying and to seek thy soul but the soul of my Lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God your life is bundled in the hand of the Lord open heart surgery car wrecks come on Satan seeking your life not just to take it but to discourage you but your life is bound in the bundle of not life but eternal life sealed unto the day of your Redemption look how she's speaking and David knows as he's a spiritual man and there's a spiritual woman and she's speaking listen when that woman that was bowed down to Jesus healed my daughter well we don't you know the the children's bread is not for dogs your old Gentile dog you know he didn't cut no slack no sir he wasn't being hateful but all of a sudden she says she says Lord and he says oh where'd that come from that came from the father inspiration he didn't see he didn't see no pill or Fire come down but he knew that God was dealing with her because he opened the door he opened the door man you know Grace is out here they believe it but do you know you have to access that Grace and the only way to access Grace is through faith by Jesus Christ not faith in Christ but the Faith of Christ so now she's prophesying and it shall come to pass when the Lord shall have done to my Lord according to all the goodness that he has spoken concerning thee all the prophecies when he was anointed king she knew who he was hey amen and she knew God and she knew the word of God and she believed the word of God she said David look at Jonathan David you know Jonathan was the next heir to the throne that was his throne he said David when you come to your throne he had already accepted the kingship of David you're talking about a spiritual man amen he wasn't jealous over that throne no sir he said David when you come to the throne remember my children she said David when you come to the throne Hallelujah not if you come to the throne it don't look like it comes to the throne but she said when you come to the throne amen remember thy handmaiden hallelujah oh man you go on down there and read man he looks at he and he says surely the Lord has sent you he recognizes the presence of the Lord he recognizes the inspiration of God you know sometimes you can recognize when God is dealing with somebody not because they're jumping shouting and dancing around it's because there's something going on on the inside and you see God dealing with somebody not just their brain she said Lord and he responded not just to her but he responded to the father he opened the door through her and she said Lord because he was Lord to the Gentiles not the seed of David we'll meet him in the air listen he's the son of man but when you and I meet him in the air he's going to be son of David we're meeting a king yes you better believe it because we're a bride we're the queen so what's he do he forgives her he says you're forgiven okay so now she's Justified Glory but there's a problem that you can't get married yet that's true first husband still a problem God's going to take care of it he don't go home and say oh Lord kill nabal so I can marry David no she goes back to her wedding vows she goes back to David or to stand that neighbor right that's it and then when he solves up the next day he tells her about him he tells her tells him about everything yeah and then about three days later God touches him and he's dead now she's sanctified beautiful is that right exactly right now she's free to do whatever she's independent Independence Day hallelujah we're free we're independent that because a woman can't have children by herself that's the fruit of the marriage is that right that's exactly right and she's going to bring fruit on to God and so David hears about nabal and he proposes to her and she responds and she's born again baptism of the Holy Spirit she's United with David and brings forth the life that I now live [Music] the lives that I now live out of the abundance of my heart beautiful creating me yes David knew there was a problem and he knew the problem wasn't up here and you knew the problem was down here man that's why we got to come to Calvary the problem was not up here the problems down here the psychiatrists can't handle it nope the preacher can't handle it no Mom and Daddy can't handle it might be able to give you some material yeah they might be able to give you some instruments they might be able to give you some word to lead you to him but you've got to find them send I lied and thy truth that it might lead me to your dwelling place to your Tabernacles and in thy light I'll see light yes he looked at Jesus he was the light of the world Amen John said they'll look at you you're the light of the world but they won't see light they only see Darkness I was I was looking at the in the motel room there's a clock and it was right by my head and I was looking to see what time it was and I went to sleep and I woke up about 5 20. and I looked at the clock and you know how when you wake up in the morning sometimes you'll have your eyes will be kind of foggy and I looked at that clock and it was foggy I thought oh no got service counting on again and that thing was so foggy I couldn't I couldn't hardly read it it was so foggy you know the the Bible said the veil was on our hearts there it is brother I wanted to read a scripture old people talk a lot you know blessing Lord Ecclesiastes three and eleven you go read it they said he put the world in their heart that they might not find out his words I always preach that as the Veil but that's not what it says I was looking at the other day that said that word he put the world in her heart it meant eternity so then if I read it that way he put eternity into their heart and they won't be able to find my works and I thought that's strange so I got to looking at it and it says that word actually means a sense of purpose you know have you ever been doing something or walking on and there was a sense of danger that's one that's one of the words it uses in the dictionary a sense of danger Are you standing in a store and you feel like somebody's staring at you and you're thinking man I got this sense it's kind of like a fog kind of like looking at that clock oh man I feel like somebody's staring at me you look over and there's somebody looking at you and you thought oh are you are you standing in a room or something and all of a sudden you feel this presence a sense come on you can't feel the heat you can't smell it you can't hear nothing there's just this sense and you turn around it oh I didn't know you was in here it's a synth of purpose that only God can satisfy but it's like a fog you know you why am I here yeah come on where'd it come from where am I going there's a sense and God put it down in there but he put a veil to where you can't find out the work of God he has to reveal it to you so start getting light in the room this morning I said man I just can't believe this my eyes ain't got cleared up yet and I looked over there and my wife had thrown the slip over the over the clock so that it wouldn't be shining in my face and I said oh and I moved the Veil [Applause] let's stand by our heads this morning you know in all of Abigail's experience it never changed her character but when she married David she could go to church because he went to church he'd go to Revival she went to revivals she could go anywhere she wanted because they were both spiritual people Liberty Liberty is not always what people thinks Liberty is it's not the freedom to do evil is not Grace To Live unlawfully sir it's to be free it's to be the real you that you were from before the foundations of the world and you've been liberated this is our anniversary day United States is celebrating her anniversary of Liberty yeah but her Liberty she was prepared to a sanctuary in the wilderness for a woman for a period of time she is about to lose her Liberty but you can never lose your Liberty Hallelujah as we bow our heads this morning heavenly father and sorry we took so long but father I pray there's something here to encourage the people to establish this in Redemption to establish us in your word it's not a fantasy Lord I know what it was to walk that day and to know that I was eternally lost and there was no Redemption for me it was cut off but oh Lord you gave me light amen at the end of the tunnel you just wanted to see what I would do and Lord it wasn't by faith it was only by love that had been birthed into my heart Lord like Ruth there was nothing that she would reap positive by going with Naomi no more children no husband under the hand of Judgment of God it looked like but yet she was willing she'd heard something about this Jehovah and she was wanting to know more and she was willing to suffer persecution judgment so without reward she served him served her and went with her oh it's it's not by reward like Paul said none of these things move me Lord in our search for you as Moses Lord in in David's loving you we not only found you but we loved you and Paul is living for you yes that none of these things moved him This Is The Life that I now live [Music] this is eternal life Lord I know there's many Lord me Lord we need physical strength touch from you we thank you for all that you've done but it just seemed like man we're always like little children needing help yes there's challenges that's facing us some of us there's serious challenges and decisions to be made and we're it's like a fog we're not exactly sure Lord just remove the veil off the clock so that we can read it clearly and that you'll Shine the Light in our path one step at a time one day at a time just lead us like children yes Lord and may we just not always be full of questions where are we going are we there yet what what where are we now well let me see but Lord may we walk with a child like Faith oh Jesus speak to each and every one we we all seek your presence we seek conference with you you granted it to job Enoch found you because you revealed yourself to him [Music] Lord many in the Bible the woman at the well we all are represented in her but the life I now live it's not me that lives but Christ in me out and the life that I now live is Christ in me that liveth and I live by the faith not in the son of man or Not by the Son of God but the faith of the Son of God the same spirit that was in him now on you Lord [Music] we just not want to know about you we just don't want to master your word and master the message but we want to know the master of the word and the master of the message yes to know you as eternal life to know the guaranteer not just the promise but to meet the one who made the promise and that the promise is sure bless this assembly bless your bride throughout the world
