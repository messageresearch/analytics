[0:00] i know it's i've been wanting to kind of
[0:01] get down to georgia and see what it's
[0:03] like so uh i'm actually thoroughly
[0:05] impressed uh it's very beautiful down
[0:07] here
[0:08] uh great church here um
[0:10] and uh i definitely enjoyed my stay with
[0:12] the black family i actually fly out
[0:14] tonight so keep me in your prayers and
[0:15] hope i don't get lost
[0:18] but it's it's really been a great time
[0:20] to be here um definitely love
[0:23] love seeing all the believers and
[0:25] all the southern accents you all are
[0:27] just so kind so
[0:29] but uh
[0:31] i don't get a lot of that back home so i
[0:33] like talking like a southerner so
[0:35] um but quick testimony before i i don't
[0:38] i don't want to be here up here all day
[0:40] and i know i have a um
[0:42] kind of disability of talking too much
[0:44] so um
[0:45] but actually back home um i know i had
[0:48] been asking god for a while that he'd
[0:51] help me be a better witness i think
[0:53] that's all of our prayers um but a
[0:55] witness being a witness to me it's just
[0:57] i've always been wanting to do that
[1:00] in a greater way
[1:03] and i actually i was at the park at
[1:05] about 11 o'clock at night with some
[1:07] friends
[1:08] and it was something like you'd see in
[1:10] like a haunted movie like two guys come
[1:12] out of the shadows like outside of the
[1:14] trees and i didn't i didn't really think
[1:17] anything of it at the moment
[1:18] but one of the gentlemen sat down on the
[1:20] bench
[1:22] near the basketball court
[1:24] the other one started talking to me
[1:25] asking me where i went to school and i
[1:26] was i was telling them like everything
[1:28] about me like where i was from like what
[1:29] i what i did what i wanted to do
[1:32] and um
[1:33] the the brother that was out on the
[1:35] bench he kind of overheard me
[1:37] so when the guy i was done when he was
[1:40] done talking to me um the guy on the
[1:42] bench came over to me and he he started
[1:45] he started kind of asking the same
[1:46] questions and kind of
[1:49] making sure i was telling the same thing
[1:50] to him
[1:51] and
[1:52] he asked me if i knew somebody at the
[1:54] school i went to i was like yeah yeah i
[1:56] know him he's like well i'm his uncle so
[1:58] it was like we kind of got acquainted
[2:00] there
[2:01] and he asked me if i partied with him i
[2:03] was like you know sir i'm i'm a
[2:05] christian i don't party and he his whole
[2:08] demeanor changed he started tearing up
[2:10] and he he told me that he had actually
[2:12] been a christian he'd felt he's fallen
[2:14] he's fallen away
[2:15] and he asked
[2:17] he'd recently asked god if he could
[2:19] send somebody to him to help him bring
[2:21] him back to him
[2:23] and to me he he told me i may i me i may
[2:26] be that guy maybe not
[2:28] but
[2:29] he just felt like he should talk to me
[2:30] so i talked to him for until about
[2:32] actually 1 30 in the morning that was a
[2:35] long night for me but it was well worth
[2:36] it he repented and he he surrendered his
[2:39] life to christ right there on the bench
[2:41] and
[2:42] i started picking him up taking the
[2:43] church
[2:45] [Applause]
[2:49] he was definitely very um
[2:51] open to the word and you don't see a lot
[2:53] of that nowadays so um

[21:54] position he's still on the throne
[21:57] still making an intercession for us
[22:00] still
[22:01] still there
[22:03] nothing changes him
[22:05] nothing catches him by by surprise
[22:09] sometimes we get caught off guard god's
[22:12] never caught off guard
[22:14] he already knows what the devil's going
[22:15] to do before he doesn't
[22:17] he's already or
[22:19] preordained him to do it
[22:22] i told him i said this fight's rigged
[22:26] i said he's already told him what to do
[22:28] and how to do it and he's already got
[22:30] the counter punch for him
[22:33] so
[22:34] i'm thankful god's always in control of
[22:36] everything we sure appreciate you
[22:38] i'd like to you stand for the reading of
[22:41] the word with me i'd like to turn over
[22:42] to the book of james chapter one
[22:45] i'd like to take a little thought
[22:46] tonight the attitude
[22:48] of the hearer
[22:50] the attitude of the hearer
[22:53] ain't you glad god helps us with that
[22:55] that's one thing we
[22:56] all need a little adjustment with
[22:58] sometimes is our attitude
[23:00] you know we always say you need attitude
[23:02] adjustment god knows how to adjust our
[23:04] attitude
[23:05] in order to determine our altitude
[23:08] sometimes we don't fly no higher than
[23:09] our attitude
[23:11] so i'm glad god takes care of us
[23:14] start verse 22
[23:16] james chapter 1 verse 22. he said be ye
[23:19] doers of the word and not hearers only
[23:23] he said deceiving your own selves
[23:25] for if any man be a hearer of the word
[23:28] and not a doer he's like unto a man
[23:30] beholding
[23:31] his natural face in a glass
[23:34] for he beholdeth himself
[23:37] and goeth his way and straightway
[23:40] forgetteth what manner of man he is
[23:43] but whosoever looketh into the perfect
[23:45] law of liberty continueth therein
[23:48] he being not a forgetful hearer but a
[23:51] doer of the work this man
[23:53] shall be blessed in his deed
[23:58] father
[23:59] lord jesus we're looking in the mirror
[24:01] again
[24:02] and father lord we're looking lord and
[24:04] we're asking you to help us lord
[24:07] because father a man can only do so much
[24:09] lord
[24:10] and father i've done as much as i can do
[24:12] lord now i'm asking you lord now to come
[24:15] and
[24:16] use the little gift you've given me lord
[24:18] and let me get out of your way lord let
[24:20] me just be a microphone that's mute lord
[24:22] and you speak through my lips lord that
[24:24] father we'd have a testimony upon our
[24:26] hearts
[24:27] and in our lives when this all would
[24:29] come to an end lord this service and
[24:32] we'd have a testimony did not our hearts
[24:34] burn within us as you spoke to us along
[24:37] the way now granted lord and we'll give
[24:39] you the praise honor and glory for we
[24:40] ask you in jesus christ's name amen and
[24:43] amen you may be seated
[24:47] the attitude of the hearer
[24:49] james is telling us here
[24:51] he's telling us
[24:52] to be
[24:53] doers of the word not hearers only a lot
[24:56] of people hear
[24:58] but very few do it's like when you're a
[25:01] child sometimes your parents will tell
[25:02] you you need to take the garbage out
[25:05] and you heard them say it but you didn't
[25:08] do it
[25:09] so there's a penalty for that when you
[25:12] don't when you don't do what you hear
[25:14] the same way with god god tells us we're
[25:17] sons and daughters of god we look into
[25:18] this mirror and god tells us by his his
[25:21] order his word to tell us we are now
[25:24] sons and daughters
[25:25] of god
[25:27] we've not changed our position god has
[25:29] not changed his thoughts he's eternal
[25:30] god he never changes in any way he said
[25:32] i hear you o israel i'm the lord thy god
[25:35] and i change not so he changes his not
[25:37] in his thoughts but a lot of times we
[25:38] hear what the word says about us we look
[25:41] at the word brother sam we study the
[25:42] word we believe the word but then we
[25:44] forget
[25:46] that we are part of the word
[25:48] we're just we hear sometimes but we fail
[25:51] to react
[25:52] the right way toward the word like we
[25:54] should we fail to respond we fail to
[25:56] have the right attitude and i believe
[25:58] the prophet told us he said the right
[26:00] mental attitude toward any divine
[26:02] promise
[26:03] will bring it to pass
[26:05] so it's not god's attitude toward his
[26:07] word he's already said what he said he
[26:09] would do and he'll do just what he says
[26:11] it's our attitude and how we approach
[26:14] his word
[26:15] we say lord we may not understand it but
[26:17] god we're going to believe it anyway
[26:19] we're going to do it because you said we
[26:21] are when we look into this mirror of the
[26:23] word of god we look in the mirror and it
[26:24] says i'm a son you are now
[26:27] sons and daughters of god not going to
[26:29] be
[26:30] not might be you already are
[26:33] and if we could ever get to that
[26:34] situation we're into that position that
[26:36] with revelation knowing who we are then
[26:38] brother said when we get in our position
[26:42] recognize who we are
[26:43] and recognize those two spirits working
[26:45] within the framework then and withstand
[26:48] them
[26:49] a lot of people recognize the spirits
[26:51] working within the framework but with
[26:54] standing he says satan will become
[26:56] powerless see satan wants us to have the
[26:58] attitude well we can go we went this far
[27:01] but that's good enough he's like that's
[27:03] great i want you to stop right there
[27:05] because you're not going on to withstand
[27:06] me but i'm here to tell him this morning
[27:08] this afternoon take notice on him we're
[27:11] here
[27:12] and we're going to withstand you we're
[27:14] going to fight back we're going to press
[27:16] toward the mark of the high calling in
[27:17] christ jesus we are here because we are
[27:20] overcomers
[27:21] paul said he causeth me to triumphant
[27:25] he made us winners
[27:27] he said you'll overcome by the word of
[27:31] your testimony and the blood of the lamb
[27:32] the blood of the lamb is sufficient
[27:35] it's the it's the sustainer it's the
[27:37] power giver the life that was in the
[27:40] blood come back upon us as believers we
[27:42] are more than able
[27:44] well sometimes we take the attitudes
[27:46] down let's just look at the children and
[27:48] the children the hebrew children just
[27:50] from it here they are and here they are
[27:52] in egypt
[27:53] they've been in there 400 years they've
[27:55] read the scrolls they what the prophet
[27:57] said they'd be there 400 years and god
[28:00] would raise up a deliverer to deliver
[28:01] them out here he goes
[28:03] get
[28:04] and starts dealing with the man that he
[28:07] thought he was a brother terence he
[28:09] thought he was a failure he thought he'd
[28:11] missed it he thought he was done for he
[28:14] went in he was in it raised in egypt 40
[28:16] years and the only thing he did by his
[28:19] own ability was kill one stinking
[28:21] egyptian so here he goes out into the
[28:24] desert
[28:25] discouraged defeated
[28:27] beat up sometimes we go into a dead or
[28:30] sometimes to recognize we're still what
[28:31] god said we was
[28:33] we just don't realize we don't know the
[28:35] reason we went there because we didn't
[28:37] go the right way the first time so he's
[28:38] trying to get us focused back on him
[28:40] he's the answer to it so here here's
[28:44] this here's the prophet no other one i i
[28:47] guarantee you moses walking around well
[28:48] lord my mother told me this and and by
[28:51] the scripture said it i was going to be
[28:54] the woman lord i messed this thing up
[28:56] something's happened
[28:57] maybe i ain't the right one maybe i'm
[29:00] not the one that's supposed to be doing
[29:01] it and until to understand he ate the
[29:04] one but he had to yield his vessel to be
[29:07] used to be done that so here he comes
[29:09] but i love how the scripture he said and
[29:12] he's seen that flame up on the mountain
[29:14] but he said something happened
[29:17] something happened there when he turned
[29:19] his attitude changed he turned aside to
[29:23] see what was going on
[29:25] sometimes god has to get us in the place
[29:27] of a desert into a place of
[29:30] heartache and trouble sometimes to get
[29:31] us to turn aside to see where the main
[29:35] source is coming from he had to meet the
[29:38] pillar fire for himself
[29:40] and when he turned aside and went to see
[29:43] what was going then he had his
[29:44] commission
[29:47] he had done
[29:48] he received the voice of the sign
[29:51] and he and when he told him what to do
[29:54] and he made all kinds of excuses his
[29:56] attitude was still wavered a little bit
[29:58] he said well i can't speak good
[30:00] uh
[30:01] i'm not eloquent of speech
[30:03] make god mad
[30:05] i mean you know we try to make all kinds
[30:07] of excuses we try to give god all kind
[30:09] of attitude you know
[30:11] and like brother brown said he said when
[30:13] a man god has to chase every man down he
[30:15] calls to preach
[30:16] i mean sometimes i get word when the man
[30:18] says i want to be a preacher and i
[30:20] always tell him i want you to if that's
[30:22] what you want to do do it
[30:24] but i mean is that what god wants you to
[30:25] do
[30:26] i mean if
[30:27] it's god calling you you can't get away
[30:29] from him
[30:31] when god calls you automatically your
[30:33] thing is as a human being it's to run
[30:37] it's a rhyme
[30:38] and say lord not me
[30:40] not me lord there's many more qualified
[30:43] many more men should use it call what
[30:45] pick one of those
[30:48] but then when you meet that pillar of
[30:49] fire
[30:50] and he gives you a commission
[30:52] he said moses
[30:54] take his shoes off
[30:56] i'm going to show you something moses
[30:57] that i can step into you
[31:00] and i'm going to be the deliverer
[31:02] see what he did he wanted to take
[31:03] complete control of moses
[31:06] he took control of his failures he took
[31:08] control of his faults he took control of
[31:11] his mistakes he changed his whole
[31:13] attitude and then here comes an 80 year
[31:16] old man no longer with the sword
[31:20] no longer with the human ability to
[31:22] fight and defeat the egyptian all he had
[31:26] was a little stick
[31:28] it was a one-man invasion
[31:31] and here he goes down and where are you
[31:33] going moses
[31:35] if you look at me like
[31:37] now
[31:39] now lord you're going to use him
[31:41] but he had got to the place to where he
[31:43] had used himself up that where god could
[31:45] use him
[31:47] he knew that he had no more ability
[31:49] anymore he had no way to do anything
[31:51] within himself that's the way we have to
[31:53] come to god say god i'm used up
[31:56] there's nothing left that i can use
[31:58] to help you all i can do is surrender
[32:00] myself completely to you so here he goes
[32:03] down
[32:04] walks up to pharaoh let my people go in
[32:06] favor looks at him like wow
[32:09] this guy's back
[32:11] he's back he run like a coward and here
[32:14] he is back again
[32:16] he said i said let my people go
[32:20] so here he throws down his
[32:23] stick
[32:24] and it becomes a snake
[32:26] pharaoh says we got those
[32:29] we got people to do that
[32:31] you know what i wonder about a lot of
[32:32] people have challenged this message but
[32:35] they don't even have the sticks of
[32:36] janice and jamers
[32:38] they have nothing to throw down to match
[32:40] it
[32:41] nothing to match it
[32:43] but little when when satan tried to
[32:46] match it it was consumed
[32:48] by the original thought that god had he
[32:51] swallowed the other serpents picked it
[32:53] back up the hebrew children heard of
[32:56] this he stick his hand in his side pull
[32:58] it out and it'd be to have liberty put
[33:00] it back and he'd be healed again they'd
[33:02] seen those things god brought all those
[33:04] plagues on
[33:06] god brought every one of those plagues
[33:07] on him to humble pharaoh and here's the
[33:10] children of israel
[33:12] their attitude they go out there
[33:14] they don't even get
[33:16] probably a hundred miles away from egypt
[33:17] right to the red sea and it's like less
[33:19] out here to die
[33:21] boy what kind of leader are you moses
[33:24] boy you made a mistake
[33:26] right here we stand we can't look who's
[33:28] behind us do you realize that's the
[33:30] greatest army that the world has seen in
[33:33] our day
[33:34] they're ready they're right here on us
[33:37] they're affecting the consumers and you
[33:38] led us right here
[33:40] they failed to see who was leading them
[33:43] they failed to see god was using moses
[33:47] they had attitude you're and they went
[33:50] right back
[33:51] you failed us again moses
[33:53] and they thought well maybe
[33:55] maybe god made a mistake bringing him
[33:57] calling him to lead us out here but he
[33:59] said stand still
[34:01] and you'll see the salvation of god
[34:03] just take time
[34:05] take notice what god's doing give god a
[34:08] chance
[34:09] when he said he'd do something he'd do
[34:11] it
[34:11] so here he stretches forth his rod you
[34:15] ain't never seen a sea open before
[34:17] here they go across the red sea open up
[34:19] dry land
[34:21] two million people walk across it i
[34:23] imagine the kids was touching the waters
[34:26] they go looking at the fish swim by
[34:28] never seen it before
[34:30] get on the other side
[34:33] here comes the egyptians
[34:35] they didn't slow down god moved the
[34:36] pillar fire and went in front of them
[34:38] here they come
[34:39] they got in there and god said that's
[34:40] just what i wanted
[34:42] see if you can if that's not the
[34:44] provided way for you you're drowned
[34:47] if you're just following this message
[34:50] and not a part of it you'll drown in the
[34:52] red sea
[34:54] because here he come and he knocked the
[34:56] wheels off the chariots
[34:58] they fell in there and then guess what
[35:00] here comes the water here come the water
[35:03] and it drowned in them they drowned it
[35:05] there they got the tamarind got the
[35:08] tamarind they shouted they sung the song
[35:10] and he said you'll see them no more
[35:14] no more will you see them how many times
[35:16] does our enemy attack try to attack us
[35:19] that god would slay it and we see him no
[35:21] more
[35:23] and then here we go right on further
[35:25] with it and their attitude changed so
[35:27] quickly because they're not he's not
[35:30] they think god's not doing what they
[35:32] want to do
[35:33] they're going there said you let us out
[35:34] here today we're going to thirst to
[35:36] death
[35:37] then you say god drowned him
[35:39] why could god not give you water
[35:42] but their attitude we've got to be
[35:44] careful with our attitude toward god and
[35:47] what he's doing
[35:48] they look and see and they've seen this
[35:51] and they still said you led us out here
[35:53] to die
[35:54] this water's bitter
[35:56] so he doesn't he throws to stick into
[35:58] the water water go on we're going to die
[36:01] again
[36:03] i mean what faith
[36:05] what confidence where is people's faith
[36:07] at where was their confidence in and
[36:10] what god said here i'm going to deliver
[36:11] you i'm going to take you to a land
[36:14] flowing with milk and honey
[36:17] here they go
[36:18] in their journey again
[36:20] god rub caused the rock
[36:22] moses smites the rock
[36:24] drink the water two million people
[36:27] drinking out of rocks
[36:29] think about it i mean wake up
[36:32] that just don't happen every day
[36:34] i i've hit many rocks and they didn't
[36:36] know water come out of
[36:38] them and then they say that oh then
[36:41] later on we got number water we're
[36:43] hungry
[36:44] what you're going to feed us
[36:47] we're going to die
[36:49] what's our attitude many times we go
[36:51] from what a brother brown says we're
[36:52] either coming out of a trial or going
[36:54] into one
[36:56] and here they go into the next feed us
[37:00] angels start cooking food they feed man
[37:03] they eat man
[37:04] they even try to hide it and it spoils
[37:06] them
[37:07] you got to have a fresh experience with
[37:09] god every day
[37:11] what you had yesterday will not supply
[37:14] you today
[37:15] you got to have a fresh source every day
[37:18] they eat that and they get tired of the
[37:19] manna man i bet that was the best my i
[37:22] can't imagine how good that was they eat
[37:24] them
[37:25] oh we're tired of it
[37:28] give us some meat
[37:30] hear the complaining again
[37:32] give us some meat
[37:33] so god said okay send you quail
[37:37] i now quail for two million people
[37:40] i've nev i've
[37:41] i've never seen that many quail at one
[37:43] time
[37:45] it's a miracle and they know it it's a
[37:47] miracle
[37:48] but their attitude changes so quick
[37:51] and god says here i'm gonna lead you
[37:52] right down in here you're gonna
[37:55] you're gonna take the land
[37:57] it's flowing my milk and honey
[37:59] everything's gonna just be just like i
[38:01] said see we're no we don't trust god we
[38:04] don't trust him we we get so
[38:05] dissatisfied
[38:07] with something well that's all that
[38:09] preacher preaches on sometimes
[38:11] well maybe that's all you can you can
[38:13] digest at this time
[38:16] i mean in order to go hire you you must
[38:18] don't complain about what you've eaten
[38:20] say thank god for what i'm giving he'll
[38:22] give you something else
[38:24] but we get to complain with him so much
[38:26] so here they send out 12 spies down down
[38:29] into the land there it is
[38:31] my goodness can you imagine grapes as
[38:33] big as grapefruits coming back to eat
[38:36] them tasted them
[38:38] and two of them believed it
[38:41] two of them believed it brother brown
[38:43] said there was of another spirit if you
[38:45] look at that another spirit it means of
[38:47] another attitude
[38:48] they had a different attitude than they
[38:50] had the other 10.
[38:51] the other 10 came back and said
[38:53] wow
[38:55] yeah we got that but boy you can't you
[38:58] can't imagine
[38:59] these giants over here
[39:01] whoa
[39:02] my goodness
[39:04] there is no way we can take those guys
[39:07] no way we are and look at the attitude
[39:09] turn them into just what there was they
[39:11] become an insect
[39:13] they become a grasshopper
[39:19] looked in that word and god said they
[39:22] was going to give it to him
[39:23] he was going to live right and then all
[39:25] they all they can do is hop around now
[39:28] we're grasshoppers
[39:30] we're grasshoppers did you see that
[39:32] guy's arms did you see that spear
[39:35] and here two men have caught
[39:38] the attitude of god
[39:39] stand up on there and say we're more
[39:41] than able to take this thing look at the
[39:43] fruit he said what it was there's the
[39:45] honey there's the spoils there it is
[39:48] it's ours
[39:49] but brother brown said there was ten
[39:51] lion preachers they persuaded the people
[39:53] saying
[39:54] moses there's no way and they rejected
[39:58] the word of god and they wandered in the
[40:00] wilderness for 40 years and died
[40:05] wondered
[40:07] wondered
[40:08] their attitude was wondering
[40:10] we've been around this round he said
[40:12] i'll destroy them can you imagine that
[40:15] after seeing all those things how many
[40:17] times have we seen god do miracles in
[40:19] our church miracles on things after
[40:22] promises after promise after promise at
[40:24] the promise
[40:25] and i said well something comes up i
[40:28] don't know if god do anything about that
[40:30] why can't he
[40:31] why can't he
[40:33] has he lost his power
[40:36] has he stepped down and said satan take
[40:38] over i'm scared
[40:39] no he's not
[40:41] it's our attitude that keeps us from
[40:43] every divine promise of god
[40:46] it's our attitude and what we hear
[40:49] they heard we'll take the land ten 10
[40:51] others said no way
[40:53] look at this
[40:54] it's impossible
[40:58] is anything too hard for god
[41:01] satan says there's no way you're going
[41:03] to make it through this code no way
[41:05] you're going to be able to do this we're
[41:06] doing it
[41:09] why because god said we would
[41:18] he promised in his word that we would do
[41:20] it
[41:21] i like this little parable it says
[41:24] who am i describing
[41:27] is the advance of man
[41:29] of our true selves
[41:31] its roots are inward but its fruit is
[41:34] outward it's our best friend or our
[41:36] worst enemy
[41:38] it's more honest
[41:40] and more consistent than our words
[41:42] it's an outward look
[41:44] based upon past experiences
[41:46] it's a thing that draws people to us
[41:49] or repels them
[41:51] it it's never content until it's
[41:54] expressed
[41:56] it's the librarian of our past
[41:58] it's the speaker of our present
[42:01] it is the prophet of our future what is
[42:03] it it's our attitude
[42:06] attitude your attitude
[42:08] determines where you're at with christ
[42:10] either you take him at his word or you
[42:12] don't take him at his word
[42:14] either you grumble and complain
[42:16] you look at the look at the anointing
[42:18] upon this age
[42:20] grum complaining
[42:22] white again they try to make racism and
[42:25] all this and we're all one
[42:28] we're all one
[42:31] we're for the human race it's not about
[42:33] they try to point us into that direction
[42:37] to give us a fight against our brothers
[42:38] and sisters and thank god it's not that
[42:40] christians don't look at it that way
[42:43] we don't look at race
[42:45] we look at christ
[42:48] see he tried to break that down to the
[42:50] woman at the well the samaritan
[42:52] she said you worship in jerusalem but us
[42:55] we worship here
[42:57] he said but there's a time coming when
[42:58] you're going to worship me in spirit and
[43:00] truth he broke the segregation between
[43:02] them
[43:03] he said i've come to save all we are one
[43:06] body
[43:08] many members he's the
[43:11] no hallelujah
[43:13] what is attitude
[43:15] and why is it important
[43:17] attitude defined as a person's
[43:19] prevailing tendency to respond favorably
[43:22] or unfaithfully to an object
[43:25] a person
[43:26] or a group
[43:27] or an event
[43:29] either positive
[43:30] or negative
[43:33] it's how we think about things or how we
[43:35] feel
[43:36] attitudes are formed by what we believe
[43:40] to be true things
[43:42] we look at the word and the word says
[43:44] what we are but we don't believe in
[43:47] i'm a failure i'm this i'm that the
[43:50] bible says you're a son and daughter
[43:52] your child is the king
[43:54] you're not what satan tells you
[43:57] brother and said i'm no longer the son
[44:00] of charles and ella branham i am the son
[44:02] of the living god
[44:05] why was that slave that come over here
[44:07] so special because he got treated better
[44:10] because they fed him better they did no
[44:12] they asked him why
[44:13] did he act that way because he knew he
[44:15] was
[44:17] he was still a king son no matter where
[44:19] he was at
[44:20] he knew his father was a king and he
[44:22] conducted himself
[44:24] like a king son that's our problem are
[44:26] we conducting ourselves like a king son
[44:29] or daughter
[44:31] with our circumstances
[44:35] her facial expressions
[44:37] give what my wife always said i can tell
[44:38] you didn't like that because the way you
[44:40] look i'm like
[44:41] oh i seen that
[44:44] she said your face
[44:46] will tell on you every time
[44:48] and it was somebody say something like
[44:50] i thought what you thought were you what
[44:52] was that look for
[44:54] well
[44:55] you know
[44:57] i have a problem with stupid
[44:59] you know
[45:00] when you do something like that i try to
[45:02] i said lord help me
[45:04] not to
[45:06] not to be so
[45:08] just smile
[45:10] say well
[45:11] god even winked at ignorance at one time
[45:14] you know but you know sometimes things
[45:16] happen in our facial expressions
[45:18] sometimes the preacher will be preaching
[45:20] and you look and he's somebody saw is
[45:21] going
[45:23] and then somebody's going
[45:25] man
[45:26] and you're like
[45:28] and everybody say i enjoyed it i said
[45:30] notify your face it doesn't look that
[45:33] way
[45:34] it doesn't look that way because it
[45:35] takes more
[45:37] energy to frown and it doesn't smile
[45:40] they say brother you smile all the time
[45:42] i say because i'm happy
[45:43] i'm happy i know what i deserved i
[45:46] deserved hell brother donny and he gave
[45:48] me
[45:49] a free pass
[45:51] do not go to jail
[45:53] he hit me he got me a get out of jail
[45:55] pass
[45:57] and you know your voice
[46:00] shows your attitude sometimes
[46:02] and somebody said something you
[46:04] oh my
[46:05] what what what what was that and said
[46:08] it's your voice
[46:10] i say god remember james said bridle the
[46:14] tongue the holy spirit sometimes we
[46:16] our mouth speaks
[46:18] for us
[46:20] you know the bible said the tongue is a
[46:21] ready rider
[46:23] and we'll get something to start and say
[46:24] oh my
[46:25] satan give me these
[46:27] diabetes
[46:28] he said oh thank you
[46:30] i appreciate you saying it i sure did
[46:33] you took them i give you
[46:35] this is my arthritis no it ain't
[46:39] it's his
[46:40] your blood pressure that's his
[46:43] your problem they're satans
[46:45] they're not yours you're sons and
[46:47] daughters of god they're not yours
[46:50] in our voice
[46:52] and they say did you like it yeah i
[46:54] liked it
[46:55] you did
[46:57] you you really didn't like it because
[47:00] your voice didn't
[47:01] your voice it tells on us
[47:04] remember the bible says
[47:05] how the abundant heart the mouth
[47:08] speaketh so we got to have a heart
[47:11] connection with god
[47:13] we got to watch how we speak and how we
[47:14] act
[47:15] and you know
[47:16] you're going down the road and somebody
[47:17] catch up
[47:20] maybe they cut you off just to see how
[47:22] you'd act bro brown said sometimes
[47:25] god sees how you react to an action i'm
[47:29] saying god help me
[47:30] help me because we're in the flesh
[47:33] and if we don't pray like we should we
[47:34] don't read like we should our attitude's
[47:36] bad
[47:37] you don't have to tell your wife you've
[47:39] not been praying or reading your bible
[47:41] she knows it
[47:44] she knows it
[47:45] and you know what if she ain't
[47:47] then come on
[47:49] whoa my goodness jump right
[47:52] i'm like whoa my goodness
[47:55] down
[47:56] whoa
[47:57] my goodness
[47:58] what have i done now i mean in the same
[48:01] way with us
[48:03] we shouldn't have treat one another that
[48:04] way
[48:05] you know if we disagree with someone we
[48:07] still ought to love them brett brown
[48:09] said we ought to be able to badly
[48:10] disagree with one another and still put
[48:11] your arm around him that's the attitude
[48:13] god desire
[48:15] he badly disagreed with him he hated his
[48:17] sin but he loved the sinner
[48:20] faith is having a positive attitude
[48:23] about what you can do
[48:26] and not worrying about what you can't do
[48:30] your destination is in god's hands
[48:33] i love that i'll have to say this this
[48:34] is one of my favorite things god set us
[48:37] on the gps
[48:39] god's power to save and you know your
[48:42] attitude
[48:43] when the little garmin i guess that's
[48:45] how you say a grommet or whatever that
[48:47] is and you put it in there you got those
[48:49] in there and first thing you got to do
[48:50] brother terrance you got to agree
[48:52] to follow the instructions
[48:55] that means no matter what you well i
[48:57] know i
[48:58] i was traveling one time with my wife
[48:59] and he said now you need to go down and
[49:01] get on 26
[49:03] to go to buford i said 26 20 looks
[49:06] really good
[49:07] i'm going to florence anyway and so here
[49:09] i get on 20
[49:10] and i'm three hours
[49:12] away from where i should have been
[49:15] it took me i took me three hours behind
[49:16] because i did not obey
[49:19] what the gps said
[49:21] but when you agree
[49:22] when you brother said total obedience to
[49:25] every word entitles you to the holy
[49:27] spirit
[49:28] you can't buy i love it though sometimes
[49:31] it'll say recalculating
[49:33] i've heard the holy spirit recalculating
[49:35] you're going the wrong way today
[49:38] you better get back over here
[49:40] well i just want to go over here a
[49:41] little bit you get back over here
[49:44] yes lord
[49:46] but it recalculates you
[49:48] in the holy spirit only a son and
[49:50] daughter of god will respond to that
[49:53] maybe i said there's many ways to heaven
[49:54] no there ain't there's many ways to hell
[49:57] but one way to heaven and that's through
[49:58] jesus christ i don't care what nobody
[50:00] says
[50:01] [Music]
[50:03] there's only one way
[50:05] one truth
[50:06] one life
[50:07] one
[50:08] one baptism one lord one faith it's one
[50:12] one one
[50:14] that's it
[50:16] but brown said it's a one-way highway
[50:18] there is no u-turns
[50:20] it's a one-way highway go ahead and turn
[50:23] around you'll fall off remember the
[50:24] woman said brother branham
[50:26] he had that dreams told her
[50:28] he she said sister you can't go with
[50:30] them high-heeled shoes
[50:32] up this way
[50:34] it won't happen
[50:35] she said oh yes it will i can do what i
[50:38] want jay
[50:39] she went on what did he hear she fell
[50:41] off into the fire
[50:44] because her attitude was not responding
[50:47] to the word of god
[50:49] go on
[50:51] they say
[50:53] you don't have to there ain't no prophet
[50:55] for this age go on
[50:58] bye-bye
[50:59] i'm walking right here because i know
[51:01] you know what i'm walking i'm walking in
[51:02] those bloody footprints
[51:04] and i'm watching them
[51:06] huh i don't see no bully footprints over
[51:08] there i don't see no bloody footprints
[51:10] over there
[51:11] i'm not following
[51:13] when is people gonna realize we're
[51:15] following christ
[51:19] but when you put that in there i agree
[51:21] then listen to the gps
[51:24] and you know what i am hearing the sound
[51:26] of the gps telling me now brother sam
[51:30] you reached your destination
[51:33] we're right here
[51:35] and people say oh no oh to get over
[51:37] there i need to go there
[51:39] oh go ahead
[51:41] go ahead go on there if you want to go
[51:43] that way
[51:44] that ain't what the lord said the bible
[51:46] says this way
[51:47] he said straight
[51:49] is the gate
[51:51] and there is the weight that leaves the
[51:52] right but brawl
[51:54] is the way that leads to destruction oh
[51:56] i'm just gonna go with the crowd go
[51:58] ahead
[52:00] and look where they're going
[52:02] watch where they're walking watch what
[52:04] it's producing
[52:06] this is the only mission that produces
[52:08] holiness
[52:12] they say i can do what i want to now
[52:14] [Applause]
[52:15] i'm glad i can't do what i want to
[52:18] because i don't want to
[52:20] if i done what i wanted to i would go to
[52:23] hell
[52:23] every one of us would because this man
[52:26] loves the world
[52:28] this man loves the things of the world
[52:31] but that emerald man says
[52:35] no you're not
[52:36] i'm saying oh god thank you jesus oh i'm
[52:39] so glad i can still hear your voice
[52:42] don't you do that you know what when i
[52:44] was out in the world and everything i
[52:46] got into worst trouble when i didn't
[52:48] listen to my mother
[52:50] and she she was my pastor
[52:53] remember she's the fifth gospel and i
[52:55] wasn't i was and she said don't you go
[52:57] there don't you do that tonight don't
[52:59] you go nowhere i feel funny
[53:02] and i think
[53:05] and i'd get into worse trouble
[53:07] and come back and hoping she'd pick me
[53:08] on the back brother sam and say well you
[53:11] know what she told me the way of a
[53:12] transgressor is hard son
[53:14] i'm like oh mom
[53:15] please help me she said you know better
[53:19] you know better
[53:21] we got to be stern with our children we
[53:23] tell them what's right and it's not if
[53:25] they don't do it it's not your fault but
[53:27] if you don't tell them it is your fault
[53:29] the bible said train up a child in the
[53:31] way it should go and it will not depart
[53:33] from them
[53:34] it will not depart from it didn't
[53:37] brother
[53:38] he did not depart from me i'd go do
[53:40] something he said you know better than
[53:41] that i think oh man that's just man what
[53:43] was that
[53:44] like oh my
[53:46] he said you know it better
[53:48] i thought oh god please have mercy on me
[53:51] you know
[53:52] it's cause we don't listen and then we
[53:54] can find ourselves marriage is wrecked
[53:56] church is wrecked
[53:58] people wreck because they don't listen
[54:00] to the gps
[54:03] they don't listen to christ he's got
[54:05] this already mapped out for us
[54:08] he's got the evacuation rap
[54:10] route down pat
[54:13] he knows the way
[54:15] he knows how to get there
[54:18] we've never been there he has people
[54:21] saying well god you know if you do it
[54:22] this way i believe it comes out better
[54:25] he's like go ahead then you're all
[54:27] messed up and you're like oh god please
[54:28] help me how'd that get in this mess he
[54:30] said cause you wanted it
[54:32] i mean i read a quote the other day
[54:33] brother brown said he said you know what
[54:35] he's talking about that he'd turn you
[54:37] over to a red bait mine and you'd be
[54:39] damned by
[54:40] he said god
[54:42] if you don't accept the truth god will
[54:44] make you believe it and then damn you
[54:46] for it
[54:48] what did he do with the that scripture
[54:50] look at michael when he come to tell the
[54:51] truth and those prophets was telling
[54:53] something else they had the scripture
[54:55] people say oh we'll take the bible they
[54:57] took the bible brother sam but they
[54:59] didn't listen to an ordained prophet
[55:01] they had 400
[55:03] but there was liars
[55:04] because there was a spirit went down and
[55:06] said i'll be in their mouth and lie
[55:08] because ahab had to die
[55:11] he'd already been cursed for what he did
[55:13] to nabal
[55:15] but i said oh yeah you'll be accepting
[55:18] god i'm going accepted by them and
[55:21] rejected by god i'll take god
[55:24] and even look at the attitude to ahab he
[55:27] knew he spoke the truth to him
[55:29] he said
[55:30] give him to feed him the waters of
[55:32] sorrow and the blessing and when i come
[55:34] back i'll deal with you michael said if
[55:36] you come back at all god has not spoke
[55:38] to me
[55:39] and guess what he didn't come back
[55:42] and the children it was still disobeyed
[55:44] and the prophet i mean
[55:46] the attitude toward the word it's the
[55:49] attitude of what we hear
[55:50] we hear something
[55:52] i don't know why when you preach the
[55:54] truth brother said i see it mormon when
[55:56] you preach it's true strong and hard
[55:58] i've never seen so many people offended
[55:59] i'm not saying people hear but if it
[56:02] offends you what's wrong with why does
[56:04] the truth offend you
[56:06] you tell them what the prophet said what
[56:07] description you lined up with the
[56:08] scripture and what the prophecy in their
[56:10] offense i ain't the way i believe it
[56:13] maybe the way you believe it ain't right
[56:17] because if it don't line up with the
[56:18] word of god this is this is the road map
[56:21] this is the road map
[56:23] that's what brother bram did he didn't
[56:25] he didn't have some foreign book he was
[56:26] reading now though
[56:28] he read out the scriptures
[56:30] he come back to turn us back
[56:32] to the faith of the fathers
[56:35] oh we don't need you you don't need one
[56:37] go ahead
[56:38] you'll be no more than the denomination
[56:40] do what you want to do
[56:43] do it quickly
[56:45] you know what look at judas's attitude
[56:47] when he come up to christ
[56:49] he kissed him
[56:50] with a warm kiss
[56:52] but he had a cold heart
[56:55] he betrayed the son of man with a kiss
[56:58] many have betrayed
[57:00] jesus christ in this eye with a kiss
[57:03] they kissed the truth and turned from it
[57:08] you know how dangerous that is
[57:10] he said you'd been better off if you'd
[57:12] have never
[57:14] been born
[57:17] i said oh god don't let me be like that
[57:20] let me respond to you when you say go
[57:23] this way it may look rough but god
[57:25] you're going to help me i said god give
[57:27] me like david said give me heinz feet
[57:30] where i can walk on these
[57:32] hard rocks and these things to climb
[57:34] higher it's not an easy path
[57:36] what did danny henry prophesy he said
[57:38] because you have chosen my way
[57:42] it's a hard way
[57:44] what do we expect taking ice cream
[57:48] what do we think we're on a picnic
[57:52] we're in a battle why do you think he'll
[57:54] give you a shield why do you think he'll
[57:56] give you the breastplate why do you
[57:57] think he'll give you a sword and a
[57:58] helmet because it's a war
[58:04] hope
[58:04] people you notice that in the
[58:06] denominations and stuff and even
[58:08] sometimes people try to teach you it's
[58:10] going to be it's going to be easy i said
[58:12] it ain't easy
[58:14] it's tough
[58:18] a lot of people talk to talk but they
[58:20] can't walk the walk
[58:23] that's what james is saying don't just
[58:24] talk it
[58:25] do it
[58:27] and the only way you're going to do it
[58:28] is you've got to have the doer in you
[58:30] if the door's not in you you cannot live
[58:32] this message you cannot produce this
[58:34] message if you're not being born again
[58:36] forget it
[58:37] i tried to live it and found out
[58:41] ain't gonna happen
[58:42] so i
[58:43] i turned and said well i'm not gonna be
[58:45] a hypocrite but you know what that
[58:47] didn't change god's attitude toward me
[58:50] he said down the line that that boy is
[58:52] gonna come
[58:54] cause he's mine i'm not gonna lose one
[58:55] of them i don't care
[58:57] what he does but you know what i am
[58:59] amazed
[59:01] that people walk away with his met from
[59:03] the message and have attitude toward the
[59:04] message
[59:05] when i walked away i said it's truth i
[59:07] just can't live it
[59:09] i said i won't touch it
[59:11] but that's because i had a
[59:12] representation
[59:14] i said i can't live
[59:15] and i even get when god came to me that
[59:18] special day in my car a supernatural
[59:20] experience with god i was i said i never
[59:22] i'll never go to church again boy wasn't
[59:24] that a lie
[59:27] he said make every man's word a lie and
[59:28] here's the truth
[59:30] what do you do you're not gonna put me
[59:31] in church you put me behind the pulpit
[59:33] to preach the gospel i thought my lord
[59:36] no wonder i was running satan was trying
[59:38] to run me from the truth but i tried to
[59:40] give i tried to him i said lord i went
[59:43] too far
[59:44] there's no hope don't give up on your
[59:45] children you know what if you don't pray
[59:47] for your children and your loved ones
[59:49] and your husbands and your wives if you
[59:51] don't pray for them do you think satan
[59:52] is going to start praying oh yes lord
[59:54] help them please
[59:55] no i like what the lord told me he said
[59:57] if you don't pray for them who will
[1:00:00] we have not we have
[1:00:02] the opportunity to pray we have the
[1:00:05] token that we can't apply
[1:00:07] i told him i said i went too far lord
[1:00:10] but i love those words he spoke to me
[1:00:11] brother he said you never
[1:00:14] went far
[1:00:16] enough
[1:00:19] brother sam i said sign me up
[1:00:21] i'm going all the way
[1:00:23] seal me or kill me
[1:00:25] feel me or throw me away set me on fire
[1:00:28] god
[1:00:29] and guess what he did
[1:00:32] he did
[1:00:33] he did
[1:00:35] he set me on fire
[1:00:38] he said we'd be a consumer fire it's his
[1:00:40] fire burning in me i'm thankful for that
[1:00:42] don't make excuses to him just say lord
[1:00:46] i'm not where i want to be
[1:00:48] but god i know you'll get me where i
[1:00:49] need to be
[1:00:51] and i'm willing
[1:00:53] to do whatever you want it may hurt lord
[1:00:56] but lord i'm not going to complain
[1:00:58] do you know the problem with the
[1:00:59] israelites
[1:01:00] is their feet
[1:01:02] was pointed toward the promise but their
[1:01:04] heart was in egypt
[1:01:06] that's why they said we'd be better off
[1:01:09] if he left us in egypt
[1:01:11] wow think about that brother sam we're
[1:01:13] better off
[1:01:14] that whip you you forgot that
[1:01:17] you forgot killing your mama killing
[1:01:19] your brother you forgot that that's
[1:01:21] better than what you got now man i'd
[1:01:23] rather die in the desert
[1:01:26] i'd rather thirst to death
[1:01:28] than to be back under that
[1:01:30] at least i could live at least you could
[1:01:32] do what you could do
[1:01:34] but listen
[1:01:36] but think about that a lot of people's
[1:01:38] feet are pointed toward the promise but
[1:01:40] their hearts back in the world
[1:01:42] they want they're still
[1:01:44] they got frog religion
[1:01:48] they're looking like they're going but
[1:01:49] they're looking back
[1:01:51] we don't got nothing to look back to
[1:01:55] boy when jesus christ showed me hell
[1:01:57] when he that day he cut me and he showed
[1:01:59] me hill and i said oh god i don't want
[1:02:01] to get out and he showed me calvary i
[1:02:03] said i'll take calvary
[1:02:04] i take care and i'm not changing my mind
[1:02:08] no matter what satan does no matter what
[1:02:09] comes on me no matter what happens
[1:02:12] i've not changed my mind
[1:02:14] i'm not going back i'm not going to quit
[1:02:17] i'm like i said god
[1:02:19] either you give me strength to press on
[1:02:21] or i'll die right where i'm at
[1:02:24] i refuse to turn back
[1:02:27] i refuse to let go of the plow i said
[1:02:29] sometimes god you vulcanize my hands to
[1:02:32] the plow sometimes i stumble and it
[1:02:34] drags me but i said god let me get back
[1:02:37] up let me get back up
[1:02:40] and guess what he gives me grace to do
[1:02:42] it it's our attitude
[1:02:44] do you know our behavior or lack of it
[1:02:47] shows the way we perform in our tasks
[1:02:49] toward god oh i believe you don't read
[1:02:53] you don't study you don't pray you don't
[1:02:55] fellowship your brother sister i believe
[1:02:58] what do you believe
[1:03:00] i'm a question i asked them what do you
[1:03:02] believe you don't want to go to church
[1:03:04] you don't want to
[1:03:05] you don't want to do this you don't want
[1:03:07] to fellowship you don't want
[1:03:10] what do you believe
[1:03:12] when the bible says
[1:03:13] love one another and you run one another
[1:03:16] down and you talk about one another and
[1:03:18] you beat one another up
[1:03:21] that ain't what the bible says
[1:03:25] he said do good unto those that
[1:03:26] despitefully use you bless them and
[1:03:28] curse you let me tell you here this
[1:03:30] afternoon you can't do that unless he's
[1:03:32] in here
[1:03:34] because you know what
[1:03:36] we're still wanting an eye for an eye
[1:03:38] and a tooth for a tooth
[1:03:41] god had to come and change them because
[1:03:43] they liked that
[1:03:45] they loved that when they brung that
[1:03:47] woman and caught in the act
[1:03:50] their attitude was here stoner
[1:03:54] but where was the man
[1:03:56] where was the man
[1:03:59] it takes two
[1:04:01] where was the man it was probably that
[1:04:03] dirty old priest
[1:04:04] that brought her out there
[1:04:06] pushed her out there
[1:04:08] said here she is
[1:04:12] oh but he just his attitude was
[1:04:15] let's see how they can handle these
[1:04:17] words
[1:04:18] he said ye
[1:04:19] without sin
[1:04:21] cast the first stone
[1:04:24] we're always wanting to throw a stone
[1:04:27] but we don't all we need to realize
[1:04:29] we're not worthy to throw it
[1:04:34] when you want to stone your brother drop
[1:04:36] it
[1:04:37] drop it and stop it
[1:04:39] and say god i'm just as guilty
[1:04:42] as he is
[1:04:43] if it wasn't for the grace of god was it
[1:04:45] for your mercy
[1:04:47] wasn't for your
[1:04:48] powerful grace
[1:04:50] i'm just as guilty
[1:04:52] he said i'll change their attitude
[1:04:55] and from the eldest to the least
[1:04:58] they heard the rocks drop
[1:05:03] he said woman
[1:05:05] where is that accuses
[1:05:08] oh oh my
[1:05:10] that was like me
[1:05:11] satan brought me to him his amps and all
[1:05:14] his devil shot he's getting he's guilty
[1:05:17] kill him
[1:05:21] he said you thou sin
[1:05:23] that's the first stone
[1:05:25] they dropped the stones brothers and
[1:05:27] sisters
[1:05:28] and when he he raised his head and said
[1:05:30] richard where's your accusers
[1:05:33] i said lord i have done he said neither
[1:05:36] do i
[1:05:39] he said my blood washes you clean
[1:05:43] you are free
[1:05:46] if we don't preach the truth how will
[1:05:48] the people be free
[1:05:52] that's the commission
[1:05:53] preach the truth
[1:05:56] don't water it down
[1:05:58] don't sugarcoat it tell it like it is
[1:06:04] we're not hot bed plants
[1:06:06] everybody wants a preacher to spray
[1:06:12] sorry i don't have a spray bottle
[1:06:14] neither do i have a pacifier
[1:06:17] all i have is truth
[1:06:19] and to eat the truth you must have teeth
[1:06:24] eagles eat meat
[1:06:26] paul said i come to you look at
[1:06:29] attitudes that come to you that you
[1:06:30] should have been teachers
[1:06:32] but you're still on the milk
[1:06:35] my what a rebuke to them
[1:06:38] change your attitude
[1:06:40] change our attitude toward things
[1:06:43] it's not that
[1:06:44] satan wants to get at you
[1:06:46] it didn't happen nobody but me
[1:06:49] god's punishing me
[1:06:51] if you're sin repent
[1:06:54] if you ain't say god you found me worthy
[1:06:56] to go through this
[1:06:58] but i know that if you've allowed me to
[1:07:00] go through it you're going to take me
[1:07:01] through it
[1:07:04] oh glory be to god
[1:07:06] aren't you thankful for that
[1:07:09] it's the way we put ourselves into it
[1:07:12] you know the energy you put into what
[1:07:14] you believe shows whether you believe it
[1:07:16] or not
[1:07:19] i'm amazed that people don't even read
[1:07:22] the bible they don't read the message
[1:07:23] they don't listen to tapes
[1:07:25] they just take our word for it
[1:07:27] well god challenged me on that
[1:07:29] brother terence he said how do you know
[1:07:32] that man is telling you the truth if you
[1:07:33] don't read
[1:07:34] and you don't study you don't
[1:07:37] you think you can remember stuff no you
[1:07:38] can
[1:07:40] but i'm glad there's something on the
[1:07:41] inside because this thing is so close
[1:07:44] so close
[1:07:45] let's see the very elective it's
[1:07:46] possible your hats you said should be
[1:07:49] god
[1:07:50] keep me aware
[1:07:52] and awake
[1:07:53] to your promises
[1:07:57] oh hallelujah
[1:07:59] let me
[1:08:00] have the attitude
[1:08:02] to believe you
[1:08:03] even when it looks like there's no way
[1:08:05] it can happen
[1:08:08] knowing that god you'll make it happen
[1:08:12] i like what george mueller said he said
[1:08:14] god specializes
[1:08:16] in the impossibilities
[1:08:19] he said all things are possible to them
[1:08:21] that believe then why are we not seeing
[1:08:23] those things it has to be our attitude
[1:08:26] toward what we hear
[1:08:27] we'll say well that was for brother
[1:08:29] johnny but it wasn't for me it was for
[1:08:30] me too
[1:08:32] brother brown said if god ever done it
[1:08:34] for one person if you'll come the same
[1:08:36] way he's obligated to do it for you
[1:08:39] whoo boy i took to that i said lord
[1:08:42] whatever you know what i'm not jealous
[1:08:44] of people that's higher up to me
[1:08:46] a lot of people try to pull one another
[1:08:47] down i want
[1:08:48] i want to know what they did to get
[1:08:50] there
[1:08:51] how did they dedicate their life
[1:08:53] how did they pray what did they do to
[1:08:55] get there lord i want that i don't want
[1:08:58] their position i want to know how to get
[1:08:59] there
[1:09:00] i'm looking
[1:09:02] what'd he do how'd he do it
[1:09:04] how did he get there for that promise
[1:09:06] and brother sam i'm determined to get
[1:09:08] there
[1:09:09] by god's grace i'm going to do it in
[1:09:11] spite of myself several tell me you
[1:09:13] can't do it the inward man says you're
[1:09:14] more than able
[1:09:16] it's your mountain look at caleb even
[1:09:18] when he got old he never forgot the
[1:09:21] promise of god
[1:09:22] he said give me
[1:09:24] my mountain
[1:09:26] huh me and i have been around for a long
[1:09:28] time we're getting old things are
[1:09:30] happening but i'm still crying give me
[1:09:32] my
[1:09:32] mountain that's mine that promise is
[1:09:36] mine
[1:09:38] you promised it god
[1:09:40] you said it in your word
[1:09:43] that settles it you said it
[1:09:47] you're more than able to do it
[1:09:50] you think kobe just slowed god down
[1:09:55] not even he even caught him off guard
[1:09:58] he's like i'm allowing this
[1:10:01] for the people that really don't want to
[1:10:02] come
[1:10:04] now they have an excuse to stay home
[1:10:06] watch it on the stream
[1:10:08] i know some people are sick and you
[1:10:09] can't come but i mean when you get well
[1:10:11] why are you still home
[1:10:13] why are you still at home
[1:10:15] are we at the movie theater we popping
[1:10:17] popcorn we drinking drinks we doing all
[1:10:20] this and watching them
[1:10:21] is that the way we approach god is that
[1:10:23] the attitude what are we looking for
[1:10:26] what about when we when we can't come
[1:10:28] are we still praying for the pastor are
[1:10:30] we still praying for the church god move
[1:10:33] god i remember doing through that
[1:10:34] epidemic when i was at home brother
[1:10:36] teresa had a screen i was praying oh god
[1:10:39] i don't have to be in that church i am
[1:10:42] the church god i'm required i desire you
[1:10:44] to come to my church today
[1:10:47] i am the church of the living god this
[1:10:48] building is not the church you are
[1:10:53] i said come to my church
[1:10:55] and preach to me
[1:10:57] right here
[1:10:58] you know what i got it results
[1:11:00] i said oh god my wife would tell you
[1:11:03] he'd come down in there just like i was
[1:11:04] sitting there
[1:11:06] he walked by
[1:11:07] and touched me
[1:11:09] i said oh jesus
[1:11:11] i'm so thankful that you're still the
[1:11:13] faithful high priest that can be touched
[1:11:15] by the feeling of our affirmativeness so
[1:11:17] thankful for your grace and mercy
[1:11:20] do you know our attitude is the great
[1:11:21] determined determining
[1:11:24] process of our life
[1:11:27] you know how did you
[1:11:28] you know how did you
[1:11:30] do you know when john glenn was coming
[1:11:31] into the earth people thought he was
[1:11:33] they said made a mistake they said he
[1:11:35] said they told john get your attitude
[1:11:37] right
[1:11:38] they thought should have been attitude
[1:11:40] but there was three
[1:11:42] stations selling and they had to get
[1:11:44] them all in order to come down to that
[1:11:46] right one he had to have his attitude if
[1:11:48] he said well this one's stronger or that
[1:11:50] one's stronger but he had to have his
[1:11:52] attitude right he had to obey what he
[1:11:55] heard
[1:11:57] that's why they said get your attitude
[1:11:58] right
[1:12:00] if you want to get out of here
[1:12:02] you better get your attitude right
[1:12:05] i like a little parable said about a man
[1:12:07] uh grandpa he was always so grumpy and
[1:12:10] grumpy about everything fussed about
[1:12:11] grandma everything
[1:12:13] said his grandkid come brother sam and
[1:12:16] rub some of that old mustard that stinks
[1:12:18] i don't know limb burger cheese or
[1:12:20] whatever horrible smelling stuff it
[1:12:22] smells like rotten feet or whatever and
[1:12:24] said he was asleep and he woke up and he
[1:12:26] woke up with the attitude
[1:12:28] man this bedroom stinks
[1:12:32] walked in the living room man this
[1:12:33] living room stinks
[1:12:36] walks in the kitchen
[1:12:37] wife cooking man that food stinks
[1:12:41] walks out on the porch and man this
[1:12:43] whole world stinks
[1:12:46] you know what problem was
[1:12:48] he was the one that was standing
[1:12:51] sometimes we
[1:12:52] we
[1:12:54] point out everything else is taken but
[1:12:56] it's our stinking attitude
[1:12:58] it determines what we are and as
[1:12:59] christians our attitude toward one
[1:13:01] another
[1:13:02] brother brown said listen to this
[1:13:04] brother brown said improving his word
[1:13:06] before we pray for the sick we've got to
[1:13:09] get the people in that attitude
[1:13:12] i believe that's why we don't see as
[1:13:14] much more than we should
[1:13:16] he said
[1:13:17] it's the attitude
[1:13:19] that always brings the results
[1:13:22] my if you never hear nothing it's the
[1:13:24] attitude that brings the results
[1:13:28] job said don't you slay me
[1:13:30] yeah i trust you and the end result was
[1:13:33] greater than the beginning he got back
[1:13:35] everything he had and more
[1:13:38] if the rich young ruler would just give
[1:13:39] what he had he'd got back that and more
[1:13:43] he'd had eternal life plus
[1:13:46] you don't need a plus if you've got
[1:13:47] eternal life
[1:13:48] you've got it all
[1:13:50] he said
[1:13:52] it's the attitude
[1:13:55] you take towards god
[1:13:57] that brings the results
[1:13:59] improving his work he said it's your
[1:14:00] approach
[1:14:02] your the attitude
[1:14:04] is what it takes
[1:14:06] and what it what it is tonight
[1:14:09] dear friends it takes the attitude
[1:14:12] we are and we believe that we are in the
[1:14:14] presence of jesus christ we believe that
[1:14:16] right now don't we
[1:14:18] he said but it's your attitude that
[1:14:19] brings the results the mechanics is here
[1:14:23] the dynamics is here
[1:14:25] if you can just get
[1:14:27] started god will do the rest
[1:14:30] just say i believe it start walking
[1:14:33] brother brown said you want to get
[1:14:34] healed see a healed body and walk toward
[1:14:36] it
[1:14:37] get one foot in front of another that's
[1:14:39] what he promised to us brother sam he
[1:14:41] promised us that
[1:14:44] it's your attitude well god healed that
[1:14:46] one but i reckon he can't heal me
[1:14:49] no he can't with that kind blood brain
[1:14:50] said if you don't believe if jesus
[1:14:52] christ stood here he couldn't believe
[1:14:54] you he couldn't heal you because you
[1:14:55] don't believe him
[1:14:58] oh hallelujah harvest time he said and
[1:15:00] he said in his bible that
[1:15:03] he would judge the world by jesus christ
[1:15:06] and we read here that jesus christ is
[1:15:09] the word
[1:15:10] in
[1:15:11] in hebrews 13 8 says he's the same
[1:15:15] yesterday
[1:15:17] today and forever
[1:15:19] and said so therefore he will judge the
[1:15:23] church by their attitude toward christ
[1:15:26] who is the word
[1:15:27] well i don't believe that said be better
[1:15:30] we'll just baptize in the father son
[1:15:32] holder
[1:15:33] go ahead
[1:15:35] attitude
[1:15:36] those apostles they did what he said for
[1:15:39] them to do
[1:15:40] do you think they would go contrary to
[1:15:42] what he said after they received the
[1:15:43] holy ghost
[1:15:44] they baptized in the name of the lord
[1:15:46] jesus christ
[1:15:48] oh hallelujah ain't you thankful for the
[1:15:50] grace of god
[1:15:52] he said now i think that's all right
[1:15:55] if
[1:15:56] he said if a woman
[1:15:57] wants to dress and make themselves look
[1:16:00] decent and clean ladylike
[1:16:02] well i think there's nothing
[1:16:04] nothing to that to me he said but when
[1:16:06] you get to going to that thing into
[1:16:09] making it a little pride
[1:16:12] then you're wrong it's your attitude
[1:16:15] everybody look at me
[1:16:17] look how i dress look how nice i got
[1:16:20] look at the car i have look at the house
[1:16:22] i got what's that got to do with it
[1:16:25] what's that got to do with anything that
[1:16:26] don't mean nothing god god ain't
[1:16:28] temporal
[1:16:29] these are all temporal things it's good
[1:16:30] that we have nice things i don't regret
[1:16:32] i'm just glad i got the attitude if
[1:16:35] god's blessing you brother terrence
[1:16:36] praise god i want him to
[1:16:38] because you know what when he blesses
[1:16:39] terrence you're blessing me
[1:16:41] i'm part of that body see if we never
[1:16:43] get that we'd quit acting like we do we
[1:16:45] wouldn't be jealous
[1:16:47] who's the best preacher who's the most
[1:16:50] dynamic who's this who's that we just
[1:16:52] say god use us
[1:16:54] use us lord
[1:16:56] and don't if if if brother sam's
[1:16:58] preaching i want to be the best blocker
[1:17:00] for him brother aaron's preaching i want
[1:17:03] to be a blocker i love to block if you
[1:17:05] ever been around me and i ain't
[1:17:06] preaching i love it
[1:17:08] i tell you what i like hitting satan
[1:17:10] because he's paying attention to the
[1:17:11] preacher instead of me and boy i like to
[1:17:13] play dirty
[1:17:15] i like to take his knees out because
[1:17:17] he's running after the preacher and i
[1:17:19] will chop block him
[1:17:21] i told him there's no rules in this
[1:17:23] no rules in this and he would do you the
[1:17:25] same way we block see it's we all have
[1:17:28] the same
[1:17:29] desire
[1:17:30] is to get people to christ to make the
[1:17:33] rapture our attitude do you know your
[1:17:35] attitude determines whether you're going
[1:17:36] to the rapture or not
[1:17:40] if you are you in rapture attitude do
[1:17:42] you wake up looking for the coming of
[1:17:43] the lord he said he's only coming to
[1:17:44] those who are looking
[1:17:46] we say oh well you know maybe you come
[1:17:48] maybe he won't
[1:17:50] well you're going to be like the five
[1:17:52] foolish
[1:17:53] the five foolish
[1:17:55] what did the fight what was the problem
[1:17:57] with the five foolish
[1:17:58] they had the lamp profession a lot of
[1:18:00] people had the profession of this
[1:18:01] message but they never actually
[1:18:03] possessed it
[1:18:05] they had a professional brother sam but
[1:18:07] they didn't possess it they had to let
[1:18:09] profession but they didn't have the all
[1:18:11] possession
[1:18:12] see how key the holy spirit is we've got
[1:18:15] to have the holy ghost we've got to get
[1:18:18] it every day we've got to have a refill
[1:18:20] a refill when i come to church i said oh
[1:18:22] god run it over run it all the way down
[1:18:25] the saucer i don't mind licking on the
[1:18:27] table lord give me that oil
[1:18:33] because i know that oil is what's going
[1:18:35] to get me out of here let's stand
[1:18:38] where's your attitude what are your
[1:18:40] attitude toward this message what's your
[1:18:42] attitude towards your brother and sister
[1:18:43] what's your attitude towards people
[1:18:46] your attitude determines where you're at
[1:18:49] the promises are still there he said i'm
[1:18:51] the lord thy god that healeth thee and
[1:18:53] he never changed his attitude
[1:18:56] he said
[1:18:56] he that believeth on me
[1:18:58] shall be saved and he that believeth not
[1:19:00] is already condemned you don't have to
[1:19:02] condemn them they don't believe they're
[1:19:03] already condemned
[1:19:05] we don't have to fight this message did
[1:19:06] not come for us to fuss and fight over
[1:19:09] who's right and wrong i can tell you
[1:19:11] who's right jesus
[1:19:15] i like what brother brown said about
[1:19:17] attitude he said he'd come to that one
[1:19:19] preacher he said he had the truth but he
[1:19:22] had the wrong attitude
[1:19:24] the wrong spirit he said but i went to
[1:19:26] another man he didn't have the truth
[1:19:28] like we do but boy he had that he had
[1:19:30] the right attitude
[1:19:33] he said god can work with the right
[1:19:35] attitude
[1:19:36] he can cha if you got the right attitude
[1:19:38] god can work with you
[1:19:40] if you don't i'm right and everybody
[1:19:42] else is wrong
[1:19:44] i don't know about that
[1:19:45] i thought jesus was right and the rest
[1:19:47] of us was wrong
[1:19:49] and that's why he died because we was
[1:19:50] wrong
[1:19:52] while we were yet dead in sins and
[1:19:53] trespasses he died for us
[1:19:56] he come to change mind your attitude by
[1:19:58] giving us the holy spirit look at the
[1:20:00] attitude change
[1:20:01] in stephen when jesus was on the cross
[1:20:04] he said father forgive what they do
[1:20:06] stephen preached him a message they was
