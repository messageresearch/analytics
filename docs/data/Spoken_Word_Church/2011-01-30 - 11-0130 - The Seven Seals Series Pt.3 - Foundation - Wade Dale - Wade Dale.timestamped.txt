[0:03] yeah know where I'm

[0:09] okay thank you you cannot make a u-turn
[0:11] on the Golden Road okay once you're on
[0:15] it you're on it that's great is
[0:18] it I'll have satisfaction in
[0:24] itself all
[0:27] right one more time anybody know
[0:30] Regina's here
[0:32] now yep here are you okay did you break
[0:38] any make sure is she in the way in the
[0:43] camera excuse me oh it's high
[0:47] enough all right let's turn to the Book
[0:49] of Revelation thank you all for
[0:51] coming
[0:54] rations now what we're going to do and I
[0:57] wish and listen I don't want to be mean
[1:00] but if you're going to come you need to
[1:01] come all the time you don't need to miss
[1:03] Sunday school class cuz I'm not going to
[1:05] I can't background every Sunday so if
[1:09] you're not going to come in here all the
[1:10] time I'd rather you go upstairs and Go
[1:11] sing it I'm sorry just Hest I'd rather
[1:15] you go sing and worship and it's not
[1:17] going and that doesn't mean you're go to
[1:19] hell
[1:21] either but we need to be this is this is
[1:24] important cuz without what we're talking
[1:26] about without at least a general idea
[1:28] God can't deal with you anything urer
[1:31] right I believe we come to places to
[1:34] where we're we're at a leveling plane in
[1:36] our life and that leveling plane in our
[1:39] life is not that we're non-christians
[1:41] and not that we're not going to
[1:43] heaven but we may not make a body
[1:47] change we may have to die but and no
[1:50] disgrace to that but but my the what
[1:53] we've been
[1:54] given will change our body there's no
[1:57] limit to it says we which are alive and
[2:00] remain Paul said so we need to accept
[2:03] that we're the
[2:05] we and strive for it why
[2:08] not um Martin Luther John Wesley even
[2:11] the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul was
[2:14] frustrated I think cuz he said I see all
[2:17] I don't see all things but I see Jesus I
[2:20] see through a glass dark that him being
[2:21] a prophet he could raise up just high
[2:24] enough to where he could see that
[2:26] something was coming that was even
[2:27] greater than what he was involved in
[2:30] Martin Luther come to a place he
[2:31] couldn't get any higher than than the
[2:33] just y' live by faith and and he was a
[2:36] very short plant and that plant couldn't
[2:38] look very
[2:39] far josu lived by faith but that put him
[2:41] in the body Luther grew up a little
[2:43] higher so he could see a little
[2:46] more then the then the baptism of the
[2:48] Holy Ghost came and restored the gifts
[2:50] and it came up here a little bit higher
[2:52] but they only saw to the gift right then
[2:56] when the prophet the real Prophet came
[2:58] you know brother randam came and Jesus
[3:00] Christ came and and and you know and to
[3:03] show brother random what was going
[3:05] on he went up to a certain place in
[3:09] 1962 spoken words original C he said
[3:12] Lord I got him out of limb I don't know
[3:13] what to do he was just like Paul I see
[3:16] through a glass garly this message of
[3:18] Malachi 4 was supposed to take us all
[3:20] the way to the Rapture but I see there's
[3:22] a great you know maybe a falling away of
[3:27] people and then the Holy Spirit told him
[3:30] to pick up the pen and write which
[3:32] showed him that Malachi 4 had not even
[3:34] been brought into manifestation yet sure
[3:37] the first part happened and that's what
[3:39] we were talking about the first part of
[3:40] Malachi 4 is to to restore not what John
[3:43] the Baptist did but to restore the
[3:46] hearts of the children back to the
[3:49] Pentecostal fathers all right so brother
[3:51] randam in his sermons from 47 to 63
[3:54] that's what he was
[3:56] doing he was restoring and tying up all
[3:59] the little sins and bringing everything
[4:01] together to where we can finally get to
[4:03] a plateau that we can understand just
[4:05] like Paul and some of the rest of them
[4:07] did but then this scripture in
[4:10] Revelations 10 comes to
[4:13] him he sees another Mighty Angel that's
[4:15] why I want you to read the breach
[4:18] because he starts talking about the
[4:19] mighty angel coming down which is Christ
[4:22] now that had to be a revelation because
[4:26] this a in this let's go to Revelations
[4:28] 10 to read that today and kind of follow
[4:31] through we're going to break that down
[4:33] today and then next week we will start
[4:36] in Revelations 5 so next Sunday read
[4:40] Revelations 5 and read the breach again
[4:43] if you read it one time read it again
[4:45] listen when I say read I mean read or
[4:48] listen it's better for me to read maybe
[4:50] better for you to listen that still
[4:52] doesn't matter that's just personal
[4:55] PR that's why
[4:57] read sir that's why said read are you
[5:00] that's right you bless right exactly
[5:03] yep and I saw another Mighty angel look
[5:06] that's a a small
[5:09] a people have probed at that through the
[5:11] centuries and thought well that's just
[5:13] une Earthly Angel just like the ones The
[5:15] Messengers in the seven Church ages
[5:17] they're all little
[5:18] A's but now you would think Christ would
[5:21] be this big a right but see God hid that
[5:26] God hid that in this writing but see it
[5:29] proves when you read down further
[5:30] brother randam in the breach he
[5:33] explains and I saw another Mighty Angel
[5:36] come down from heaven here is the
[5:40] key if it would have just said another
[5:42] Mighty angel came down from heaven and
[5:46] he had a he had a in his hand a little
[5:48] book open but
[5:50] see John writes the same description
[5:53] that he wrote of
[5:55] Jesus back in Revelation CH 1 that's
[5:58] what brother R takes you back it goes
[5:59] back to Revelation 1 it says Christ this
[6:02] must be because why clothed with a cloud
[6:06] rainbow upon his head faces it were the
[6:08] Sun and his feet Pillar of Fire now go
[6:11] back to Revelations 1 and that's the
[6:12] same person standing in the midst of the
[6:15] Candlestick in Bride
[6:20] form bride
[6:23] form he was showing that he was this
[6:25] Mighty Angel was coming down to a bride
[6:30] in Bride
[6:32] form everybody understand that he wasn't
[6:34] just coming to a group of people he was
[6:37] coming in a group of people cuz he said
[6:39] he standing in the midst of the golden
[6:42] Candlestick like un the son of man I saw
[6:45] another Mighty Angel come down from
[6:46] heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow
[6:48] was upon his head and his face was as it
[6:49] were the Sun and his feet pillared of
[6:51] fire and he had in his hand a little
[6:53] book open now brother ROM goes back to
[6:56] Revelations 5 and there the book is
[6:57] closed so somewhere between between
[6:59] Revelations 5 and Revelations
[7:02] 10 somewhere in there the book was open
[7:05] that's why brother brought him on the
[7:06] breach on Revelations 5 he said this is
[7:09] the opening of the seal so from
[7:11] Revelations 5 what happens it goes right
[7:13] to Revelation 6 which is what John saw
[7:15] in symbol form
[7:18] right right then you had Revelation chap
[7:21] 7 bringing in the Jews and in Revelation
[7:24] 8 the 7th seal always remember keep this
[7:26] in the back of your mind because we'll
[7:27] cover it as we go
[7:29] always in the Bible and always the
[7:31] things that we see we see God do things
[7:34] 1 2 3 4 5 6 and then there's an interval
[7:36] there's a stop there's a
[7:38] rest um to put the seventh seal into
[7:42] eternity he put it in Revelation chapter
[7:45] 8 Revelation 6 tells of the first six
[7:49] seal read Revelation
[7:51] 7 starts talking about the Jews coming
[7:54] in then he reverts back chapter eight
[7:57] and brings in the seventh seal M all
[8:00] right right that's a breach or an
[8:03] interval all right go to the trumpets
[8:06] the Bible will go 1 2 3 4 5 six trumpets
[8:09] and stop and interject something in and
[8:12] then bring in the seventh trumpet right
[8:15] all right so watch Through the Bible
[8:17] you'll see 1 2 3 4 5 6 pause or an
[8:21] interval brother Brown calls it a time
[8:23] to rest and then God breaks the seal
[8:26] open there in Revelation chapter 8 all
[8:29] things are done for a purpose right but
[8:32] see right
[8:34] here after you see the seals in chapter
[8:36] 8 that's the seventh seal being
[8:39] open now he doesn't go he goes to the
[8:42] first trumpet Revelation 8 verse 7 is
[8:46] the first trumpet if you got scoffield
[8:47] Bible it's easy to keep up with that's
[8:49] why I like scoffield Bible he does have
[8:51] good commentary brother Brown said all
[8:53] things were not right but he still liked
[8:55] his writing first trumpets verse 7
[8:58] second trumpets verse 8 n third trumpet
[9:00] is verse 10 and 11 fourth trumpet is 12
[9:02] and 13 comes into chapter 9 to the fifth
[9:05] trumpet goes over to chap I mean verse
[9:08] 13 is the sixth trumpet and guess what
[9:11] then chapter 10 happens what is that
[9:12] that's not the seventh
[9:14] trumpet that's an interval that's a
[9:16] stopping point that's a place of rest
[9:19] brother Bown said this is that Mighty
[9:21] angel coming to the
[9:23] Jews so you and I must get this
[9:26] spiritual part there's people in the
[9:27] message that believe brother br has a
[9:29] literally come back this is where the
[9:31] return Ministry people get their point
[9:34] from that brother brandham States
[9:36] several times and it does in the
[9:38] breach that the bride is raptured in
[9:41] Revelation 4 and is not seen until
[9:44] Revelation 19 so everything in between
[9:46] is to the Jews that is correct
[9:51] naturally in the natural aspect of
[9:54] things
[9:56] Revelations 5 through
[10:00] 18 you'll see that the two prophets come
[10:03] in that the trumpets come in see the
[10:05] trumpets not even to us right but watch
[10:08] what God did in chapter 7 he interjected
[10:10] this point showing how that we're going
[10:12] to get to that cuz a gentile church has
[10:15] to be raptured first so what are you and
[10:18] I we Are Spiritual
[10:20] Jews and we're on the earth at the time
[10:23] see brother Ry makes a statement and
[10:25] they they bear on that real heavy when
[10:27] this Mighty Angel comes down brother bam
[10:29] said the seventh angel messenger is on
[10:31] the earth at the time of this
[10:33] coming well see they're saying he had
[10:36] the mighty Angel hadn't come yet and
[10:38] then over here brother R's got to come
[10:40] back and be standing on the earth and
[10:42] then this Mighty Angel come down they
[10:44] missed that point cuz that Mighty angel
[10:47] came down in 1963 to open the seals
[10:50] spiritually folks the seals have not
[10:53] open naturally on the Earth right you
[10:56] better not be here and see them people
[10:59] go hay why when because we're going to
[11:01] bring all this in if it takes all year
[11:03] we're going to cover each point then
[11:04] they say well brother rown said the
[11:06] brides raptured on the fourth
[11:08] seal that's the
[11:11] truth spiritually
[11:14] speaking in the fourth seal those lion
[11:16] Hawks man and Eagle are taken up off the
[11:18] Earth you don't see them in the fifth
[11:20] seal
[11:23] so and I'm saying that to everybody
[11:25] so so no big deal that's what's inside
[11:30] of us and when we're gone they're gone
[11:32] right the lxs man and Eagle today if
[11:35] you're born again that liox man an eagle
[11:38] spirit is controlling you if you'll let
[11:41] them right that angel in Ezekiel just
[11:44] like Brother D has been preaching those
[11:47] angels and I hope that people are not
[11:49] getting the point that we're praying to
[11:51] Angels or that's Catholicism
[11:55] right but just be aware that we
[11:57] entertain Angels under aware the things
[11:59] that we do what about that angel that
[12:02] comes down brother brandom says and and
[12:05] checks you out and goes back and tells
[12:07] the father hey this guy's acting just
[12:09] like you or this guy's not act what is
[12:12] that that's an angel ascending right
[12:15] going up and taking what you got to God
[12:18] you say well God knows everything sure I
[12:20] know he knows everything but he is the
[12:24] greatest Economist in the world he's got
[12:28] an economy that's perfect right and in
[12:31] that economy he's got God he's got
[12:33] archangels he's got cherubim seraphim
[12:36] he's got an order just like you and I
[12:38] have an
[12:39] order I wish people would understand one
[12:42] thing man did not come on this Earth and
[12:45] and just think up all these things about
[12:46] governments and how they're placed and
[12:48] and and deacons and police departments
[12:50] and all it's in the Bible right amen the
[12:53] old founding fathers of the United
[12:55] States of America and even over in
[12:57] Britain knew that they had why do you
[12:59] think over in Britain they wear those
[13:01] white
[13:02] wigs somebody read this Bible right that
[13:05] God had on a white wig and he was a what
[13:09] judge why do you think they wear those
[13:10] white wigs they got another the Bible
[13:13] most of our laws in the United States
[13:16] truthfully are based on the Bible right
[13:18] based on the Ten Commandments based on
[13:20] what the Bible says to do now it's not
[13:23] an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
[13:24] tooth anymore but we still do that if
[13:27] you kill somebody guess what you get the
[13:29] death penalty it's still a n for a nine
[13:31] and a to for a tooth okay and things
[13:34] like that that go on if people would
[13:36] just take this Bible and think it and
[13:38] not think it's so Heavenly that it
[13:39] doesn't do any Earthly good but this
[13:42] Bible was written for the economy of
[13:45] God those seraphim what do they do they
[13:49] keep the burner they keep the worshipper
[13:51] clean by burning your burning the sin
[13:53] what is that that's the blood of Jesus
[13:55] Christ there's only one way to be
[13:57] sanctified that's the blood of Jesus
[13:59] Christ sanctifies you so there's
[14:03] Angels around you that are keeping you
[14:08] clean and where's it all coming from
[14:11] they got a headquarters called the word
[14:13] of God right so this Mighty Angel was
[14:16] one angel that was special because of
[14:20] what happened there and clothed with the
[14:21] cloud rainbow upon his head see God was
[14:24] revealing who he was but no man had ever
[14:27] read that and thought that was Christ
[14:29] coming down all
[14:32] right now let's get back to our subject
[14:34] just a minute but I want you to keep
[14:35] these points in mind because there's a
[14:37] lot of people think brother Brown has to
[14:39] come back and fulfill all this but see
[14:41] they miss they miss that part of him
[14:45] coming right just like they missed the
[14:48] first
[14:51] one when John
[14:53] came Jesus was already on earth when
[14:56] John began to preach his message Jesus
[14:58] Christ was already on the earth they
[15:00] just come to a day that they met and
[15:02] what happened Jesus went on and took his
[15:04] ministry same thing with brother brand
[15:06] Christ was always here folks it wasn't
[15:08] that Christ was gone and then see that's
[15:10] where the people in the message say well
[15:11] those other ages weren't born again
[15:13] because Christ wasn't here no Christ was
[15:16] here when John preached for you know
[15:18] ever how many years or
[15:20] months but growing up they were all here
[15:22] at the same time but Jesus was not
[15:25] manifested until the father comes and
[15:27] does what makes that person and says
[15:29] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[15:31] please to dwell all right then he grows
[15:33] in Grace and knowledge and then he says
[15:34] here ye h brother Ram went through the
[15:36] same thing here's a brother random
[15:37] preaching 1947 1963 Christ is on the
[15:41] scene doing the healing doing the
[15:42] Miracles opening the word of God like it
[15:44] never been open before in the other ages
[15:47] the reason I say that is because Paul
[15:49] preached the same thing brother Brown
[15:51] preached so it wasn't anything new word
[15:54] was
[15:55] the it was the effects of the word this
[15:58] word was not done away with it's but it
[16:00] but you know you and I both can grieve
[16:01] the Holy Spirit even being born again so
[16:04] there's some part of us that can grieve
[16:07] God away from us right and still be
[16:09] Christian right well Luther could sit in
[16:12] a pub and drink a beer smoke a pip be
[16:15] justified and God saying I'm happy with
[16:17] at least what he's got he's got the just
[16:20] shall live by faith
[16:22] right but now if Luther had have been in
[16:25] this age where there would more light on
[16:27] the word mhm he would have not have done
[16:29] that that's right see it's just what how
[16:32] much you it's how much that the Bible
[16:34] says faith come
[16:36] by so if you
[16:38] never then you don't
[16:41] know if you don't hear you don't know
[16:43] that's right all right but the more you
[16:45] hear the more you ought to know but the
[16:47] more you hear the more you either turn
[16:48] it down or take
[16:51] it so we know that as they missed the
[16:54] first coming of Christ they missed this
[16:56] coming of Christ which is brother Brown
[16:57] said the bride coming of Christ coming
[17:00] out of the church because he's going to
[17:03] Rapture us and carry us away really
[17:06] that's not the coming that's in this
[17:08] Bible whenever I Shall Behold In This
[17:10] Cloud Eastern Sky you know I've told you
[17:12] before a man told me one time he said
[17:14] I'll be glad when one day we look up and
[17:16] that Eastern Sky splits and Jesus just
[17:18] walks right down on the earth and takes
[17:20] the people away and I thought in my mind
[17:22] I said if you see that buddy you're in
[17:25] trouble cuz the Bible says he'll come as
[17:27] a thief in a night
[17:29] the bridegroom cometh that's right and
[17:32] he in the night there
[17:34] in John or somewhere in there can't
[17:36] think I'm way behind myself or ahead one
[17:40] and takes us away that's going to be the
[17:41] secret carrying away of the Bride nobody
[17:43] will ever know brother Brown said that
[17:45] the brats will take place he said there
[17:46] people still think they're getting saved
[17:48] he said that people will
[17:50] go well I thought so and so that's
[17:52] message people I thought so and so was
[17:55] supposed to happen right before this
[17:57] happened to us
[17:59] and then that little small voice of
[18:00] saying it did and he missed it right so
[18:05] the Eastern Sky splitting is when God
[18:06] coming back in judgment all right now
[18:09] Israel is going to see him fight for
[18:10] them over there but the Gentiles are
[18:12] going to be done away with all right so
[18:15] let's get the
[18:16] point the whole basis for this today is
[18:21] that God is going to have a bride a
[18:24] gentile bride he calls that bride out in
[18:27] Revelations 1 1 2 and
[18:31] three everybody understand that that's
[18:33] the Gentile church that's his
[18:36] bride all right in Revelations
[18:38] 4:1 John sees a door open in heaven and
[18:44] the voice says come up hither brother BR
[18:47] said that's the Rapture of the Gentile
[18:48] Church all right right and now what
[18:52] happens to her naturally is not going to
[18:54] happen again until Revelations 19
[18:57] because you and I and I are in a
[18:59] honeymoon for three and 1/2 years with
[19:02] Jesus Christ in another dimension while
[19:05] all this hell's going on down here does
[19:08] everybody understand that yes if you're
[19:10] born again you'll be there in that
[19:13] Dimension right if you're not born again
[19:15] you're going to stay alive until
[19:18] somebody kills you or whatever you may
[19:20] be for this virgin who knows don't know
[19:22] but the foolish virgin is going to live
[19:24] and die and give their life during that
[19:25] 3 and 1/2 Years everybody understand
[19:28] that say amen amen okay bride does not
[19:32] that's why brother R says the bride goes
[19:33] up he's he's telling us the truth he's
[19:35] not lying he the bride goes up in
[19:38] Revelations 4 she's not seen again see
[19:42] that seen again until Revelations 19
[19:45] what seen in the book as the natural
[19:48] bride coming back down for the Thousand
[19:50] Years of the Millennium all right while
[19:53] that's going on you still got time right
[19:55] here 3 and 1/2 years of tribulation time
[19:58] you got God going to the Jews you've got
[20:01] 144,000 being brought out and they're
[20:04] going to come across and then they're
[20:06] all going to be killed battle of
[20:08] Armageddon that's when the world ends as
[20:10] we know it now all right so now but now
[20:15] let's click the natural part let's go
[20:17] spiritual for a moment God still calls
[20:20] out a church in Revelations 1 2 and
[20:24] three Revelation 4 shows the rapture
[20:28] that's not taken place yet we're still
[20:30] here right so now let's be natural let's
[20:33] just talk natural cuz brother Ram was
[20:35] talking about a natural happening now if
[20:39] we're gone sure whatever happens past
[20:41] that is going to be to a group of people
[20:43] that's different from you and I but in
[20:46] the spiritual aspect we've got to be
[20:48] caught
[20:50] up out of what we were
[20:53] before when you were born again first
[20:55] day first second you were born again you
[20:57] be the Rapture in your life the catching
[21:00] away right cuz Rapture really is ecstasy
[21:04] Rapture is being in a state of of of
[21:08] just Heavenly bless sitting together in
[21:11] Heavenly places right
[21:13] right while you're still here while the
[21:16] boss is still on your back while you're
[21:18] having problems in your body while all
[21:19] these things are going on your soul is
[21:22] sitting in Heavenly places but you still
[21:23] have a natural part to contend with
[21:26] right but in the spiritual part
[21:28] Revelations 5 that Redeemer that Bloody
[21:31] lamb had to come to you at your new
[21:35] birth say
[21:37] Amen right so that wasn't in heaven we
[21:40] didn't get born again in heaven right no
[21:42] that's right we got born again on earth
[21:44] right so the spiritual part of me in
[21:46] Revelations 5 that Bloody lamb took the
[21:49] book now what is the book the book is
[21:52] mine and yours name that are born
[21:55] again right right that's the book this
[21:58] this is the book that man took in
[21:59] Revelation 5 that Bloody lamb took this
[22:01] book which has got my name and your name
[22:03] in it in what symbol form or in uh
[22:09] character if my character matches this
[22:12] and my name's written all in this book
[22:14] that's right so in Revelations 5 you've
[22:17] got a Redemption going on right well
[22:21] we're redeemed here people that's right
[22:22] we're not redeemed in heaven right we're
[22:24] not redeemed over at the white Throne
[22:26] judgment that's right we bride now I'm
[22:28] saying bride now listen bride is
[22:30] redeemed right there in Revelations 5 so
[22:32] when you're born again then right
[22:33] there's where you
[22:35] are spiritually right all right now in
[22:40] Revelation 6 the seals begin to open in
[22:43] Revelation 6 that's the seals are for
[22:45] the Redemption of your body cuz your
[22:47] Soul's already redeemed it didn't need
[22:49] Redemption it was redeemed in Revelation
[22:52] 5 everybody understand say amen amen all
[22:55] right Revelation 6 is showing you how to
[22:58] get
[23:00] somewhere all
[23:02] right then Revelation 7 shows us how the
[23:06] Jews come in cuz without us leaving the
[23:08] Jews can't get what they're going to get
[23:11] right that's right and then what this
[23:14] Revelations 8 still goes into the
[23:16] trumpets you and I must spiritually hear
[23:19] what the Lord himself shall descend with
[23:22] from heaven with a shout the voice and a
[23:25] what trumpet trumpet
[23:28] trumpet so a trumpet's got to come to me
[23:31] and you spiritually the Jews believe in
[23:33] the Feast of the trumpets where you got
[23:35] one Feast here you got one here you got
[23:37] one well that's what's happening in our
[23:38] lives what is a
[23:40] feast a feast is where you go eat what
[23:43] do we eating eating this
[23:47] literally spiritually mm okay so this is
[23:51] all spiritual what brother R's talking
[23:52] about now he's going through this and
[23:54] shows us then in Revelations 9 you
[23:57] continue and then re here we are at
[23:58] Revelations
[24:00] 10 and God's going to do
[24:02] something he's going to send somebody to
[24:05] get us out cuz brother Ram did not come
[24:07] to bring us a new
[24:09] birth he did not people were born again
[24:13] from Paul's age people knew how to get
[24:15] born
[24:16] again but they didn't know how to handle
[24:19] the word like Paul did Brother Ram had
[24:21] to preach that word that's why the angel
[24:24] had to come to him and show him about
[24:26] serpent seed show him about these things
[24:28] to start getting everything lined back
[24:30] up because it had had become so out of
[24:32] cater the Catholic church was looking in
[24:36] here and seeing angels and then they
[24:38] took it out and said well we need to
[24:39] pray to this saint and pray to that
[24:40] Saint pray because they're what they're
[24:42] Angels so the Catholic Church took all
[24:45] their Dogma out of the
[24:46] Bible but it was the devil right but I
[24:51] heard brother R say the other day he
[24:53] said some of you Roman Catholics will be
[24:54] there now whether they be giving eternal
[24:56] life or whatever called bride I don't I
[24:58] don't know
[25:01] but it's what they've
[25:03] heard those old Baptist and Methodist
[25:06] that was sitting in brother Brown's
[25:07] meetings they never accepted the
[25:09] message brother Tim hes told us and
[25:12] brother Kenny caps you remember brother
[25:13] Brown talking about brother caps well
[25:15] that's brother Kenny's father brother
[25:18] Kenny actually dated sister Sharon I
[25:20] mean yeah no not
[25:22] Sharon no the other one sarahah he
[25:26] actually dated Sarah brother bram's
[25:29] daughter and brother Tim Humes was
[25:31] dedicated by Brother Bram because he
[25:32] remember he talks about old brother and
[25:33] sister Humes well they're still alive
[25:35] and nothing church but they told last
[25:39] time we were at a minister meeting they
[25:40] told us out of their mouth they said
[25:42] listen we were talking about
[25:43] television they said we all had
[25:45] television said brother Brown preached
[25:47] against it for as long as we knew it and
[25:49] said it was after the
[25:51] 60s it was in the 70s when the ministers
[25:54] really got the preaching about not
[25:56] having a television is when we got rid
[25:57] of he said everyone he said everybody in
[25:59] that Tabernacle tell see so those people
[26:02] but brother random didn't call them
[26:04] non-Christian they were living under the
[26:06] age that they were born in and the
[26:09] amount of word that they could gather
[26:10] because see even see when we get to the
[26:12] seals brother R goes over in the
[26:13] questions and answers and he said it's
[26:15] not for
[26:16] you this is not even for you just live a
[26:20] good simple Christian Life what was he
[26:22] telling them this was for something else
[26:24] coming this was another group of people
[26:26] coming Paul the same way Paul is
[26:29] preaching and talking about the
[26:31] resurrection well they philas and hus
[26:33] what do they do they sit under Paul's
[26:34] Ministry for about a year or two and
[26:36] they're listening to Paul talking about
[26:37] Resurrection Resurrection Resurrection
[26:40] Paul's talking about resurrection of
[26:41] this old man you know Resurrection from
[26:43] the dead dead works well Philly Phil
[26:47] whoever it is they go over and they
[26:48] start preaching that the resurrection
[26:50] already happened they said where did you
[26:51] get that from and we got it from Paul
[26:53] see so even out of the pure word of God
[26:56] same way with brother brandom out of the
[26:58] pure word of God they were teaching
[26:59] false teaching cuz then Paul had to come
[27:02] back and say no I wanted us to get out
[27:04] to the out Resurrection in other words
[27:05] out from among the dead right which was
[27:09] denominational Creed right so that's
[27:11] what brother Brandon was trying to do
[27:13] and then he comes in Revelations
[27:16] 10 and he says well we need to pick this
[27:18] up because what happens in verse
[27:22] 7 cuz that's when it happens but in the
[27:24] days of the voice of the seven
[27:28] Angel when he begins to
[27:31] sound the mystery one there's only one
[27:35] mystery left when we get right here to
[27:37] this
[27:38] book and that's how to beat Death not
[27:41] beat Death destroy death the bride will
[27:44] destroy death but see now the bride will
[27:46] not destroy death
[27:50] totally only in
[27:53] herself right only in herself will she
[27:56] destroy that right soon as we get out of
[27:59] here you talking about
[28:01] death death is going to rain for three
[28:03] and A2 years and it's going to be
[28:04] nothing but a bloody death so we have
[28:06] not destroyed death for this world we've
[28:09] only destroyed death for
[28:12] ourselves individual affair with
[28:14] God right no shame for the ones to die
[28:18] cuz guess what they're going to come up
[28:21] first they're going to be changed first
[28:24] all right then then we which are alive
[28:26] and remain
[28:28] let's finish this we're not even going
[28:29] to get we might have to do this again 30
[28:31] minutes is not long enough and cried
[28:34] with a loud voice verse three is when a
[28:36] lion roar and when he had cried seven
[28:37] Thunders out their
[28:40] voices I'm sorry let's go back up verse
[28:43] two let's just read it over let's get
[28:45] the whole context read it over again and
[28:47] I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[28:50] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[28:52] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[28:55] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[28:57] pillar of fire bride form what he's
[29:00] coming to a bride to then become bride
[29:03] form because that Mighty Angel watch in
[29:05] just a little one I'll show you excuse
[29:07] me and he had in his hand a little book
[29:10] open brother BR said if Christ doesn't
[29:12] come he said we're only presuming read
[29:14] your read that book the breach how many
[29:18] times he says
[29:20] presuming presuming he said if Christ
[29:23] don't come on the scene we're only
[29:25] presuming right and that's what they did
[29:27] down through the seven Church ages is
[29:30] presumed we think this was right we
[29:33] think that white horse rider was the
[29:34] Holy Ghost see I read the mighty
[29:36] conqueror just the other day in 1959
[29:38] brother bandam reads that
[29:40] scripture and teaches it as the holy
[29:42] ghost riding through the
[29:43] ages all right and cried with a loud
[29:47] voices when a Lon
[29:50] Roar well and he set his foot upon sea
[29:53] and his left foot upon the
[29:55] Earth and what he see what does se mean
[29:58] in the Bible what does water mean in the
[29:59] bible
[30:01] people what is
[30:05] Earth flesh he's coming down to do
[30:08] something in the people in flesh he's
[30:11] coming down to take over when a mighty
[30:12] Angel comes down and he puts we plants
[30:14] one on the sea and one on earth he's
[30:17] fixing to do something he didn't just
[30:18] come to just stand there and look
[30:20] pretty all right he's fixing to come
[30:22] down to take a group of people to a body
[30:25] chain all right
[30:28] and he cried with a loud voices when a
[30:29] line worth and when he had cried seven
[30:32] Thunders uttered their
[30:34] voices and when the seven Thunders had
[30:37] other their voices I was about to write
[30:39] remember John was commissioned to write
[30:40] everything he saw right and I Heard a
[30:43] Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up
[30:44] those things which the seventh Thunders
[30:46] uttered and write them not right that's
[30:48] why brother Brown calls it an Unwritten
[30:51] part not that it's got to be
[30:54] written cuz you can't add to or take
[30:56] from but it's got to be revealed what's
[30:58] already written in here all right there
[31:01] won't be another word of Bible written
[31:04] for all
[31:06] eternity can't be it'll just be lived
[31:09] out what's in this Bible right here
[31:11] right and the angel which I saw stand
[31:14] upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted
[31:15] up his hand to heaven and swear by him
[31:18] that liveth forever and ever now God
[31:20] doesn't swear by anybody but who himself
[31:22] cuz there's no other to swear by all
[31:25] right who cre created heaven and the
[31:28] things that there in he's talking about
[31:29] who Christ the Creator Christ was the
[31:31] Creator God he's showing you all through
[31:33] here who this Mighty Angel is you just
[31:35] didn't nobody pick it up until brother
[31:37] brand brought these little points out
[31:39] created heaven and the things that they
[31:40] in and the earth and the things that
[31:42] there in and the Sea and the things
[31:43] which is therein that there should be
[31:45] time no
[31:47] longer that's why everybody thinks
[31:49] brother R's got to come back an issue in
[31:52] the Millennium or issue in the Rapture
[31:55] um because it says here the time shall
[31:57] be no
[31:58] longer now we're going to read next week
[32:01] in Daniel 12 and we'll see that this
[32:02] same situation happened but in a
[32:04] different way all right now but in the
[32:07] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[32:09] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[32:12] of God should be finished as Heath
[32:14] declared to his servants the prophets
[32:17] now John interject that
[32:20] in because look at verse eight he speaks
[32:23] no
[32:25] more want you to listen he speaks no
[32:28] more of that
[32:30] person cuz it's in the days of the
[32:33] voice
[32:35] right seventh angel John interjects that
[32:38] and says the seventh angel has to come
[32:40] introduce this man then he's got to go
[32:42] off the scene because remember John
[32:44] types who the whole bride the whole
[32:48] bride John one person types the whole
[32:50] bride and the voice which I heard from
[32:53] Heaven spake unto me again now now the
[32:57] angel speaking directly to who the bride
[33:00] John everybody understand what I'm
[33:03] saying go and take the little book which
[33:07] is
[33:09] open he didn't tell the Sabbath Angel to
[33:11] do it the seventh angel is
[33:16] gone take the little book which is open
[33:19] in the hand of the Angel he didn't take
[33:21] it out of the hand of the messenger he
[33:25] took it out of the hand of the mighty
[33:26] angel
[33:27] Christ which standeth upon the sea and
[33:30] upon the
[33:31] Earth and I went unto the angel and said
[33:34] unto him give me the little book and he
[33:36] said unto me take it and eat it up and
[33:38] it shall be like Thy belly bitter but it
[33:40] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and
[33:43] I took the little book out of the
[33:45] Angel's hand brother brandom had to go
[33:48] off the scene we have to get it straight
[33:51] from Christ now it has to come through
[33:53] what brother V said right cuz that's the
[33:56] only way you going to get it that's why
[33:57] John wrote Revelations 10:7 but in the
[34:00] days of that man's voice the mystery is
[34:03] going to be finished then he's going to
[34:04] have to go off the scene just like John
[34:07] did John the
[34:09] Baptist cuz see John the Baptist said I
[34:11] must decrease that he might increase
[34:13] brother Brown said he said if I'm the
[34:15] one to introduce I must go away and he
[34:17] might he that he'll be here well that's
[34:18] what's happening right here right and I
[34:21] went into the angel I'm sorry and I took
[34:23] the little book out of the Angel's hand
[34:25] and ate it up and it was in my mouth
[34:27] sweet as honey oh it's nice to sit here
[34:28] and talk about it or it just makes you
[34:29] feel good but to live it and come back
[34:32] next Sunday right tough
[34:34] job and as soon as I had eaten it my
[34:36] belly was B but remember the Bible says
[34:39] he ate it up and I underline that he did
[34:42] not leave one page out he didn't tear
[34:45] the part he didn't like out and leave it
[34:47] he ate the whole book and he said unto
[34:50] me thou must prophesy again before many
[34:53] people and Nations and tongues and kings
[34:56] and that's exactly what what we're doing
[34:58] right now so read Revelations 5 and read
[35:03] or listen to the
[35:05] brid for
[35:25] next
