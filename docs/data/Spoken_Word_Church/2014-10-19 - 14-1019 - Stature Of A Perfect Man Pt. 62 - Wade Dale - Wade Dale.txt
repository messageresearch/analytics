TRANSCRIPT
========================================
do all that with the what she had have an answer for the question really ni the italicized words in the King James Bible are words that were added by the translators to help the reader it's usually necessary when translating from one language to another because word meanings and idioms change so so to produce a more readable translation the King James translators added certain words to the Bible text however to make sure that everyone understood that these words were not in the available manuscripts original manuscripts they s them in t before we get started my ask something sure um it's about the yeah um if I'm W to we're going to have a meeting on this I for those of you that we're not at the last Fall Festival meeting if you want to do anything with the Fall Festival meet with us

it for Kathy somebody needs to help her with her left and right are you working on that you need to put l on this and r on this one I look like I am this is all on the internet usually usually we find out who's who's who's uh left brain who's left brain or right brain when we do our Valentine's cuz usually and it's not always Kathy but most of the time it is uh they end up with three or four bags and how we you're not supposed to somebody ends up with none somebody ends up with a bunch Joyce helps out a little bit about that so we're all challenged a little bit some in some area we're all challenged but bring a gift in a bag paper bag going to play this the game this we're going to play it inside there the adults the adults adult cuz this fall festival is for the kids all right but the adults get to sit around for 3 or 4 hours so we decided we would do a right left game and we already got one that's that's uh kind of themed toward um scarecrows and you know fall festivals stuff so and pumpkins and all that so the uh the game is huh oh that's right you didn't come to the thing but we always play it at the well you the very one wanted to come and didn't anyway changed it for her okay yeah yeah yeah okay statue of a perfect man those of you that brought you book turn to paragraph 3:15 those of you that didn't you just waste your life away for next 30 minutes until we get this thing technology fixed here bring your book or your tablet with you and most of you should have it on your phone I have it on mine if anybody like to look at it brone is that your perfect man huh bring you have a Min HDMI huh Min HDM mini for what does it have does that TV have a USB plug yeah but you can't this thing once there was an update this thing cannot talk to that thing I'm talking about my thing your thing yours people do bring it let's see if it'll do it cuz our our technically Advanced people in this church takes them a couple of weeks to do things have a USB on the side of that which most of them do on the TV well that's what this is plugged in right there no USB that did you hear that I got you some meat yesterday hard to see that should be it right there us set thanks for help okay let's go to paragraph 3:15 and we're going to read through paragraph 315 now what we're talking about statute of perect man I want you to did y'all listen to that service Wednesday night that was that was past good I fill my pad up with notes but remember we talked about that last Sunday right did we not you remember that we talked about last Sunday very same thing he was preaching on except for the overcoming part now now what I'm going to do is take the overcoming part and put it in the statute of perfect man because these are overcoming okay the last overcoming is what anybody listening to me yes same thing you preach last week no that's not why I say it there's eight overcoming yeah right right the eighth one is what Daddy preached on in Revelation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 eight is what you be my son I'll give you a little snippet of that that's adoption this is where adoption happens not down here it happens up here right isn't that what it said you'll be my son okay and then we can back it through I was telling brother Joe even even in the this overcoming here you're in the temple sitting on the throne now what's the throne the throne is the baptism of the Holy Ghost right so we set with him in his throne so just keep that in the back of your mind because these are truly overcoming you're overcoming something to have virtue you're overcome coming something to have knowledge because what are you overcoming who's your biggest enemy me yourself yeah you that's right no me I'm my biggest enemy I must overcome me because my adamic nature throws me contrary to all this Godly all this you understand the godliness part of this we can have virtue uh we can be there's a lot of people in the world is real smart but it's not God smart okay there's a lot of people that has patience I've even seen people out in the world like Brother Richard Wilson said there was a man that worked with him said he was so Meek and humble that if you said Hey Joe I'm going to take your paycheck and I'm going to spend it and you're not going to have nothing he said well it's okay see that's to me that's that's just a a nature born and I like what brother remember what brother Marcus said brother Marcus remember the German that came remember he was talking about going back to your family if your family was blessed then you'll get a blessing through your family or if your family had been cursed somewhere you got to go that curse is going to be on your family right brother Brown said and even the Bible says it it goes back so many generations good and bad all right but now remember the new birth overcomes that bad you say well my father was a drunk my grandpa was see that's that's human that's something you can't do in this right okay but if you get born again it's not alcoholic synonymous it's not that I well I'll always be this no once you're born again amen it's done right that unclean Spirit has gone out of you and gone away from you all right so and and then if you got the Holy Spirit it won't let it come back sure you'll be tempted honestly you're going to be tempted amen right okay I was telling you the story you know when the Lord when the Lord when I started on my journey of justification sanctification to the baptism and the Holy Ghost he took that desire of the tobacco away from him chewing tobacco but now the next day the next two days the next three days they were you know you get around a bunch of smokers and you don't have a cigarette what's the first thing a smoker does want some want some yeah cuz you don't have one you're not with you know you're not with them you know so oh you need a cigarette you know no well see that my buddies would say hey you you don't have a dient in your mouth you need you need no I don't want it anymore had no desire for that anymore and and really folks that is in justification and sanctification that's not in the baptism of okay all these the unclean Spirit goes out at sanctification and I want y'all to pray for me because in the next few weeks I got to go do a Minister's meeting and this is what I got to do the subject do the subject on is what happens to the soul the red emptive process of the soul of man so I'm going to really have to uh put a lot in about an hour's worth of speaking to a bunch of ministers and I'd rather speak to a bunch of Sinners sometimes that's on the internet so that's okay I had daddy would too and all the other preachers if you're real honest you'd rather preach the center sometimes than a bunch of preachers brother Brown said the most problem he ever had was with what preachers right preachers are the problem and it's true preachers are the problem because you know what like me and Daddy were're talking about Friday night your pastor is right here and you can't go no higher than your pastor now if your pastor is right here you can forget going any higher unless you go somewhere else that's right do you understand that brother rown said you cannot and some of you have come from other places to hear knowing that your pastor was just at a certain spot and he was at that spot and you were at that spot okay so we must seek someone that's own up a little higher because remember Peter had Peter couldn't come down here on the day of Pentecost and just start with first Peter or second Peter add to your faith virtue but no he kept growing in Grace and knowledge and then in second Peter he comes forth and says having the divine nature of God add these things to you okay so it's a journey excuse me same way with brother brandham brother brandham had to come to the stage of adoption because only the Lord Jesus had come to that place and for us to become adopted there has to be the word has to be open right so that we can receive that word because really I think most people in the message think that it's just going to be and I've always told you this that I think people go well the Lord's coming right here right yeah and that's when he's coming no if he's coming on that day everybody's going to be ready right there at that day God didn't pick a day to come back for the Rapture for the for the body change God didn't pick a day brother Brown didn't say if we're waiting on the day that God's coming back he said God's waiting on the read of the Bride so he knows the bride's going to get ready on that day right and that's next Thursday for most of you that want to know get ready before the festival wait it's actually the Hindu festival of lights so anyway that's what it's but no just tell but but there's no red letter day on God's calendar so he's waiting on us to come to a place then he's going to come he's going to come because we're ready he's not going to come before he's going to come when that last one and I don't like that word comes in cuz there people come in these people go out when theom but when they come in and stay when the last one has made herself Rich when the last one has been birthed into the body of Christ when the because remember and don't get me wrong I don't know why I'm talking about this but we're going to talk about it anyway everybody's waiting for somebody to come from out there on the street come in to be the last one some of you me clude it could be at sanctification and been that way for 10 years and one day God will strike that give me the new birth and I'll be the last one who will be gone cuz he's not going to bring a baby in and then leave him out of here cuz if not they got to die that's right right you understand what I'm saying if not they got to die real quick and then be resurrected back up and that can happen cuz that happened to the to the um the faith on the cross you know he wasn't in Paradise I mean he wasn't dead long he was in parad went paradise and then he went up with Jesus but um and that can happen but I don't want it to happen that way we want it to be that that we come in we get born again and we become a body and then we look for the last one and I don't look for the last one out there Jun and I were talking about coming down the road about U our church doesn't do a lot of Outreach community outreach we don't we just don't do that but people come in here and I want to get these people birthed okay brother Brown said be salty yeah be salty and it'll draw them in okay but you know we're compelled to uh to sometimes go out in the highways and byways and and the hedges and all that and compel them to come in but I believe that's those people right there you see that big old long list of people that's some people that are kin to me and kin to you and their your family we're going to compel them to come in okay cuz I want them to make it I ain't selfish but I want my kids to make it I want your kids to make it but I want my kids to make it but you got to have you you got to have somebody you can't what I'm saying is you can't come to adoption on your own that's right you can't you can't do that there's a plan and a purpose of God that brings us through this statue of perfect man which makes it one of the most important to me one of the most important things that is so ill taught well you you just get everything when you believe I don't you know I don't see that uh Peter didn't get everything when he got he got the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost and he didn't jump out and say all right now you got to add to your virtue knowledge no it was a few years he went through now he might have had virtue Silver and Gold Have I None and all those things but he had to come to a place where God quickened those virtues and he could put them in the Eternal Word of God Amen there was a time there was a growth period in there and that's where all of us we got a growth period That's why that we don't need don't need to be LAX because we've had 50 years to try to get into this growth period and and you know we've stuned our growth we stuned our growth by what we eat Ain that right it why would brother have to preach a whole sermon on just the stature of right if it wasn't important then you can see though as he goes past that and you look into excuse me Church AE books talking about overcoming I believe that this message helped him see where he was yes yeah cuz if he if he wasn't if he was here and preaching to us all this see he couldn't he couldn't give you the The Headstone right it's not been revealed to him right um Martin Luther great Martin Luther started the Reformation but I doubt now listen I doubt that he ever taught on the statute of a perfect man cuz he didn't need it they didn't have to come to adoption in Luther's age okay yeah because adoption puts you at a place to where God can give you the ability to do the speaking give you the ability uh that's why I don't it's not going to be a it's not going to be it's going to be a colle leaving out of here but it's not going to be a collective Revelation it's an individual Revelation with God sitting in this room today they could be every how many people 20 or so people we could be in all different levels right but if you put yourself in a place to grow go to the right restaurant and I'm not saying here's the right place to be but I'm saying I feel that this is the right place to be because we got somebody we got teachers preachers all of us have a mindset like when we we're preaching down to brother Matthews remember after the service he said this is what we have to come to I wasn't preaching on statute perfect man at that point I was preaching on adoption in stages well see that's our call in the end time is to not to just adopt men there's more sisters in here than there are men is to adopt you so that you have the ability to speak in God's step cu the son of man is not just a man made you know son of man it's God made flesh God in human flesh not God in a man or God in just men right because remember remember what I said throw all of us into the feminist part because we're all feminist in the body of Christ so we all have feminine traits when it comes to Jesus Christ being our head okay brother please no I was just want to mention that um some people I've heard some people tell me they they feel like they need and I think what throws them off is the fact that it says holy spirit top they think that they need to get to that in order to get the Holy Spirit and a lot of people teach it like this yeah yeah well they just well they physically turn it over and and they think and they think by the way that it's at that point when they get adopted which which it is comes at that point but you can't get up to that point without the Holy Ghost working in your life anyway let's go to Second Peter let's let's read that in case somebody wants to question it or have a question cuz really excuse me really it's spelled out right here in the Bible not what the prophet said in the Bible cuz see brother Brown does make a statement see you come all the way up here and I haven't got the Holy Ghost yet well look remember one thing when you're born again you're a what b a b y baby right and the illustration I made at at brother Bray was good grief I got his keys and I he Bob gave me the keys and I handed it to a little boy in front of him that was probably what 8 n 10 years old maybe I said here go drive Bob's car and everybody whoa no no no no no why not he's got two eyes like Bob's got he's got two ears like Bob's got he has the same physical features as Bob he can even be a daddy right he has the ability yes but now why don't you give him the key character development he's a son just like Bob's a son he's a human just like Bob's a human he actually probably has more intelligence than Bob had did I say that down there down there I might have said that but anyway and he could have more intelligence really honestly he could have more intelligence human intelligence than b but what makes that boy different from him even the Bible says the Eternal godhead can be understood by the things we see I have not g been given the ability to drive a car until I'm 16 years old the law not the law it's not really the law it's what man has sat down and said look this person has has matured to this spot so therefore they can they have the ability to do this right cuz remember they took the drinking EGS and I'm just use for an example sorry but when I was growing up the drinking age was 18 right then they saw all these people getting somebody made that assumption that they were able to drink at 18 years old then they had a lot of killings and people getting killed and car wrecked so they moved it to 21 see that's man but see God doesn't do that God knows exactly what you need when you need it all right he doesn't change his law that's what David said I'm not CH he said I I'm glad you're precepts are forever they're settled so the same thing with that little boy now why not he's a human why can't he drive Bob's car but we'll all in our brain go he's not mature enough well now God's word is if you're not mature enough to be temper if you still got a temper God's not going to birth that Temperance into you until you come to the maturity that you can handle that power without character right the boy had power he was a human he could see he could talk he could speak he had the power to drive that car but he didn't have the character to drive it now that boy's never going to change in his characteristics Eyes Ears you understand he's a human you can see it looks just like B you got it yes but his growth development now remember he was born a son that's where you tell L you got to be born a son listen right here let's read this real quick verse three according as his divine power now there's only one kind of power of God and that's divine all right I'm sorry second chapter first verse second pet second Peter 1 Chapter I'm trying to hurry because it's almost time to leave verse three according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain to life see we're talking life lessons here and godliness now how can you be Godly without being born again cuz look through the knowledge of him that ha called us to glory and virtue whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature now he hadn't started in the in the in the virtues yet but you got to have the divine nature of God before he starts into the virtues now what is the divine nature of God the new birth right your old nature is not Divine there's nothing about you divine without God okay so Paul Peter's telling us right here you might be partakers of the divine nature look having escape the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this there's the key right there exactly those three words and beside this what beside the new birth that you have now right and beside this giving all diligence in other words you got to go to work you got to overcome add to your faith see he starts then in the virtues besides this read them there brother L read them that those three words and besides this what Peter saying you got to have the new birth and besides this divine nature this is what you got to have very simple in scripture if you'll break it down and besides this and besides this if this is what Peter's talking about and besides this add all right so there's the answer there we better go Richard Marlo's going to give me a look that being born again that's right being being born again being right right
