you and we just commit it all to you have your way now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name Amen the first Peter 1 verse 7 that's a trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold at purchase though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ now there's a difference in appearing in the coming right that I've always stayed it kind of made a point where you can see he can appear in any church around the world he can appear there and be there as to the form of appearing but now his coming is going to be in this day not what we look at is we we think about a physical coming it's the coming of the Bride of Christ him coming forth in the end time in the Bride of Christ so then there's a vast difference in the appearing in the coming I say he can be out there appearing but nitin he's coming he's not coming to them he's coming to the bride okay all right our end the bride would be better way of saying it okay whom having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation the prophets have inquired and sir diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you see all that Old Testament was speaking of the coming forth of the New Testament all right searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves see they seen something was going on but they knew that they was not making it manifest in fullness went unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ all right so now we know the Bible is a complete revelation of Jesus Christ in it would wind up in the Book of Revelations so we go to the Book of Revelations and pick up the thought on it all right revelations 1 and 1 says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John the by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word we had a good time last night in the the Bible study if you want to get the tape and you know listen we were covering a lot of things and a lot of over view a lot of different points you know in that I enjoy the Bible study I enjoy questions and answers because that makes the Prophet said makes a strong Church all right now what are we doing now as we're trying to talk on these things and talking about the end time and knowing that you know as we read from Peter that there's a great understanding to be made manifest through the bride of Jesus Christ at the revelation of Jesus Christ at the finality the finishing up the you know the making known and bringing forth in a revelation to you and I all right what have we been covering now we've been covering that you know the Prophet said it's just a way that he's he says now before I tell you anything you know of what's gonna take place in the church ages the main point was what he said I want you to know who I am all right so he reveals himself as the the beginning and the ending the Alpha and Omega all of the things he was which he is and shall come reveals himself as Hebrews 13:8 the Word of God to be made manifest and I asked the question last night at the end and I said I'll ask this and I won't say no more but you know we talk about the the Bible and talk about how that the book is sealed last a simple question join to the people on tape or anything they don't see it I'm holding the Bible okay now is this whole book sealed or is it only the Book of Revelations is sealed is the whole book sealed or is it just the Book of Revelations they're sealed I see then that away we can look at something and be able to comprehend truly what I've been driving for three or four services five now about the writing of the Bible right the writing of the Bible is what I've been discussing are trying to bring our thoughts and relationship to that to see you know what we're looking at all right now we know and we went through it trying to bring the point that see the Bible is it tells the past it tells the present and it tells the future all right all within the same book telling those things okay and I tried to illustrate it with like Moses as he wrote the first five books of the Bible and as his riding was back there see he was riding some little over two thousand years or more over after time had started you know but he wrote about what took place back there all right then he was covering things that was taking place right then then he was writing about those things and then he wrote about the future to come like my brother used to say how could Moses write of his own death you know because he does or you know you give him the first five books I said if you'll explain to me how that he knew what happened in Genesis you know in the creation of the world I said we won't have no trouble we're trying to understand about you know how he could write of his own death that there wouldn't be no problem because we could you could easily write now you can say I tell you what now brothers and sisters if time passes 50 more years I'm gonna die you know what I wrote the future right because if I don't I'm 78 years old I don't think I lived to be no 125 or 30 years old alright but the point I'm trying to get you to see is a is a point now and it may take the rest of this message to get it to what I want to drive hard into for you to see the day and the hour that you are living all right now that's the main thing we're trying to do talk about the writing of the Bible and see how that any writer in there any of the prophets could stand and speak of the something way before them they could speak of things that was happening right the in present and they could speak of the future because that that point would hold Hebrews 13:8 the same yesterday today and forever to bring it all the way through all right see then we look at it and you could say to most people you know they'd say well we have the Bible well that's true but you know there's a lot of things in this Bible that has not come to pass right all right so you've got a great things to come you got a millennium you've got a future home you've got all kinds of things spoke of in the Bible just to getting to that point you know to see that you you can see there's a lot of things still to transpire all right see then is it the Bible because it is written down that was the last points we were trying to bring because Paul said to the letter killeth he said but the Spirit give us life now can we say it's the Bible just cause we've got this you know because we have a book we have it written well we've got this it tells the vice-president if you're a man we do but yet there's a lot of things in there that's still not fulfilled well right now here's the quote now from the Prophet what does he say he said as long as it lays in the pages of this book it can be questioned right that's what's wrong with mankind to date especially the people of the message they're questioning what they've got but he said once it's made alive are revealed he that really didn't even say manifest he's talking about when it's revealed all right see because he's gonna have to reveal it before he could make it manifest right no see then he'll reveal that then he'll bring it into reality but I'm trying to get you to look at the writing of the Bible that there's still things left that's not finished there's things left that the Bible says will come all right and it will will transpire all right these are names you know we get in there and we could study it and go through the changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you know until I've struck the truck and we could look at that and see that those riders back there of the Old Testament especially as we read in Peter that they knew something was trying taking place you know like brother Branham says about when Isaiah said you know a virgin shall conceive he said my lord he probably went home thought what in the world did I say you know I mean that's totally crazy to mankind you know and everything for that to be able to take place but he said it did take place see now then in the writing of it see we think just because that we have it pinned you know pen down that we have the Bible well all right now is it that's the last question that I asked was this is it the Bible because it's pinned you know written down or is it really which is the most valuable to talk to you of writing something a letter somebody's right a nut or hand it to you you know and then say you this is a will and etc you know and you'd read it and you'd say oh I just inherited a million dollars well now which one's the most valuable I mean the paper says you're gonna get it right okay now we're still in the word don't get me out of there leave me in the word to worms just get my point but which did you draw the house you say well I've got the paper and it's fish writers right okay but that that could be questions because it's written on page but the day they handed me the check all right now I know that I got something real I can start planning on spending because if not I don't have it to spend alright so which is the most valuable fact of somebody giving you a paper or somebody giving you what that paper was talking about now that's the point I'm driving hard for us to see the value of the Word of God we know it's the Word of God we know it will come to pass we have no questions about it this being the Word of God you know all right and to see then by it being the Word of God it will be fulfilled and that's why I love and and you know there's plenty of other translations and things but I like the King James translation all right you know the reason I like it like we've talked about last night about the prophets and the Word of God coming to thee this prophet he didn't do away with all those translations he verified it even like Lanza's translation etc was perfect in text and everything and I'm on it sometimes I can't read it exactly I have it but yet I believe it because he said it all right now see then this this book this Bible that we have has been vindicated right so that's what we're standing on now we're standing on we have the vindication of the Bible being true but there's a lot still it has not transpired all right and see actually we are here now in reality if you'll think of this point we are in the writing of the book God is still writing we all know it ended back there when this right No yeah it's not fully made alive yet until it's made alive then you can say you're in the finishing up of all time maybe an odd point of trying to get you to see but I want you to see the Word of God and how it's written all right now in doing that then we went through the Bible through in the different times you know of the points but we've come now as kind of standing before the Book of Revelations and looking at that and coming up into that point that we can see that you know there's actually things in those Church ages we're in the seventh church age right okay you say oh no we're not age where we are if you don't think so look in the mirror as you go out you'll find out you're in the age but now we're got to be birthed out of the age into the revealed Word of God okay so now that's that's the truth of it but see now I'm wanting to approach it to the point to where to get you to read the Book of Revelations and get and look at that and see that that's unfolding all right it's unfolding right now there's things in there that are if we could read it in the correct order we would be like reading the newspaper we ought to be able to anyway the way things are happening now huh we don't even read a new that need a newspaper we we can look out and see what's taking place and know that it is the finishing up of all times all right and see there's things then in the Book of Revelations especially them I'm driving that point to get you to look at it that in the seventh search age there's things that that age proclaims there's not finished no no so you're in still in the writing of the word because we're in the reality of the lie the living word and see by having a prophet to bring us the word then we can read the word now and realize that things like I said that there are things that have not transpired yet all right there's things and and we're still in that which was which is and which is to come because that was the point that we've drove that where the Prophet said you know from the Patmos vision he said I want you to know who I am before I start telling you about these things all right now here is our thought now to pick up from here and go in a service or two on it okay to know who he is we know he's the one God the Scriptures are right we know all of those things all right but if you stopped there you would not be bringing forth the complete Bible okay now it's gonna swallow a little bit because you're gonna have to listen okay now if we are part of the word and why would we not want to believe that we're part of I mean anything it's like why wouldn't we want to believe that we're part of it all right see then if we're part of the word then the part we are to fulfill in our day it's not finished why because we're still here it's gonna finish when we walk out of here then then we can say that in a reality we've reached the position that we need to think about we say then the Bible is now alive because remember our whole point letters on the page question but the alive word in your heart cannot be questioned as I was saying I win and there Wednesday the then if somebody could take some newfound revelations you know things and days and times they could find those things would it take away from what you believe are add to it Kota fits the truth it could be a dude all right now there's many new things that are coming out now I just saw a documentary there the other day happen to just click on it and see something and I like documentaries but that documentary was was going pretty good and you know they now can prove that in the Dead Sea Scrolls that they found outstanding things and are still finding things from those Scrolls that could relate to the day in the time and says things were back there you know things were happening that we say oh no see because if any of you has run across that you know what I'm talking about that they say in the Dead Sea Scrolls that even some of the Scrolls spoke of extraterrestrial beings coming to Earth and if the Jews we're trying their best to stop them from releasing any information this is 1994-5 trying to stop them from the inner releasing any information from those scrolls you say well but brother Dale we don't we don't believe in that right we don't I don't believe in extraterrestrial beings like I said the truth can set you free definitely I mean I'm positive in my thoughts and statements I don't care what you come up and write all these books about and all of the places they get proved to find things it looks like this it looks like that I don't believe in extraterrestrial beings you know somebody in outer space or men on the other planets or etc no because my Bible says that Eve is the mother of all living so if there's anything out there she's a mother of it okay solve the problem but see the point that I'm getting at is to show you that if we take they said and not take it in such of a negative form we can take the profits message and they'd learn do a lot of fine I've told you over and over brother branham said they're in the fifties that Russia had said our plunge well we knew that had that's pretty well I you know they had to jet our plane to Germany to get at the end of the war you know World War two but he said Russia had jet our planes and flying saucers ran a new computer brother branham did you believe in flying saucers you believe in extraterrestrial beings from somewhere that flying around no I believe in them flying around from here if Russia had them don't you think we hadn't if Russia had you know spaceships to fly about and to do things don't you think we had him and the man made a comment that was in the time he said if this truth comes out said it'll destroy religion see because man religion would say oh no we don't believe in something from outer space and I don't either yet look we're at they look at the scientific age we're living in he said well what are you what are you saying I'm saying this if we take the message and listen to the message it will straighten out the thoughts that we could that no one could bring you know and there's no way to bring anything to contradict that because if we did have flying saucers in the 50s what have we got now and like I always try to emphasize that to the point because I like to read and look at things and when they was to go to Kuwait back there during that little conflict war thing you call it and I will remember about two months before that it was in the newspaper that we had was coming up with a stealth bomber and that we were to you know to bring that into being but we only had photo tops and had two of them you know two of the photo tops billions of dollars to cost to build him that was going to be supersonic great things well I remember you know I just keep that in mind well about two months later when they went into Kuwait they were 15 of them went in at one time well they sure got in a hurry and build them didn't it you understand what I'm getting at then we get to we get to news way late of what's taking place and see those those stealth bombers were great but yet see then my memory runs on back the 62 when Francis Powers was shot down by the Russians in that u2 pilot that it was more sophisticated faster than what even they revealed about these stealth bombers that was to come on now he said what are you talking about I'm talking about a reality that they can't take away from me they can't take away from me and come up and say well look at the extra astral being don't you believe in that they got history they got that yeah let him walk out and he'll speak English or Russian one of the two you know and then all of these sightings they have where they've been picked up and put over in a spaceship and carried off and brought around it's kind of funny they could all communicate you don't think nothing they could all communicate with each other what are you saying we're living in a sophisticated society that has brought forth of many of the things that mankind says doesn't exist but they do exist so what would you do brother Dale if they set down a spaceship out here in the back of the church what would you do I'd go out there and say hi guys glad to see you you know which one are you you for us are you for the Russians or everything else it wasn't drop it wasn't not my thoughts of Christianity my whole point is what can they take away from you the facts of baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if they can take that away from it's not revealed see because when it's revealed in gonna take it away there's no way to take it away there's no way to take away the revealed word so then that's why to me the revealed word is greater than letters on the page hey come on we've got our understanding from letters on the page right but then the revelation has to come from Almighty God all right so then what did brother Branham say about the Book of Revelations we'll get this little point he's talking about those people you know the understanding the coming forth as I said he said I want you to know who I am before we go any further all right we study the one true and living God we get that laid in order everything's correct we know that there's just one God we don't have no problems with ideas or concepts of mankind to try to take that away from us because it's been revealed all right but has the rest of it been revealed they said I want you to know who I am all right now what's the next stage I want you to know where I'm at Stage one I want you to know who I am stage two I want you to know where I'm at where's he at he's supposed to be in menu right I mean it's supposed to be the new birth inside of us Christ in you the hope of glory we'll see then that way we can go in to the Book of Revelations and just keep moving as it unfolds you know unto us and bringing us to a point all right now the first point is what see who he is so then what's the next stage is to see where he's at he didn't stop revealing himself all he done was changed to form that he was using all right the revelation that God gave to Jesus to give to John now that all that's trinitarianism cuz we got to God give this that's gonna know we'll get to it we've got it written down in here the scripture says you know they asked Jesus when he was coming he said I don't know he said only the Father Knows right they said I don't know he said well he was the father yeah let's see we've got the scriptures from the Prophet and the thoughts from the Prophet to make it or it'll stay in the correct line cause you see Jesus said I do nothing until my father shows reverence that he didn't do nothing seen a vision so then we look at the human side and we think well I just don't understand that well it's easy to understand if we'll just keep following the story what's the next stage first stage one find out who he is he's the Alpha and Omega the beginning the end though he was gonna come and often hey he's all of it but see he didn't stop he just started the story to were that we could follow the the writing of the Bible on through whatever but but brother Dale John wrote these back tire if your did but remember Moses wrote back there remember the other prophets wrote of back tire iron but then there had to be a time that back tire had to become a reality and this is what brother Ron said he said that Jesus didn't know when he was coming he said that was withholding he said but now at this time for the present tense of him coming to John on Patmos he said now he knows all right why because the Bible is still being written the Word of God is still unfolding to you and I all right now if that be true then see if we see who he was and then we see where he reveals where he's going I don't like the word going to go somewhere something because it gives you the wrong idea he's going to show you stage two of the story stage one was to show who he was now he's gonna show where he's at all right where's he at who is this great one he's the Lord Jesus Christ he's the one who was he's the one who he is and the one to come he's Hebrews 13:8 alright now then what happens what is the next step where does he go where what does he do he reveals himself about one true nine or right - there is the revealing of one true and living God in Revelations you know all right now let's go to the first nine and if they will pull it up baby number two on you on your notes let's get to that revelation is one nine and just read it and then we'll approach to approach all right so either number two okay go to 17 drop back to verse 9 well I got it I got it there but I'd be okay just leave it I'll be fine and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead now John's falling before this is the Lord Jesus Christ this is not brother branham coming to John because it's the Lord Jesus Christ that John is falling before and then when you get on over into of chapter 18 in chapter 19 or 21 then you'll pick up the other parts that your mind is trying to run to to say but that's it no no cuz look when I saw him I fell at his feet is digging any lady's right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the life now that's not a prophet that's Almighty God okay I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore and how the keys of hell and of death write the things now watching what does the Bible reveal what has been what is and what is to come that's the fool that's the intent of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation no matter who the authors are the router the prophets in the time that's what he's received so look what he said write the things which thou have seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter so now he's telling him to write what he sees write what you see you have already now put in writing I've given it unto you to let you know who I am now John you write what you see and what did John see okay so now then what it would go we're going over so alright we pick it up and what does it come up to drop to verse 12 it's reading I put these in and then put in it but come back to verse 12 of Revelations 1 let's see what John saw John write this and send it to the church write what you see now he didn't see he saw chapter 1 verse 1 through 9 he saw who Jesus Christ was Almighty God now where does he go from dark what's the next stage you got it okay and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with the garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow his eyes were as a flame of fire Daniel covers him the same as the Son of Man okay and he had his right hand seven voices of many waters okay and he had in his right hand verse sixteen come on up beat like on the front advice okay we get it and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and what did it wound up doing and his calendars lock him to the sunshine of his full strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet it's dead he laid now there's where we get into that this one that John sees is the Lord Jesus Christ right but what form did he see what form did he see back up first twelve row back what form did he see we understand who this is but what form was it and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle okay now brothers y'all would you pull up the the little thing that we made while ago let's look at the seven golden candlesticks okay that's what John saw seven golden candlesticks one in the midst of the candlestick like unto the Son of Man it doesn't save thee son of man because that's not the person of the son of man he's moved into another form he's moved from what he was telling John write what you know about me seal it up brainer in here but said now I want you to go another step and said going one more step I want you to see one in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the Son of man who is the son of man according to the profit on this arrives in the son he said who is the son of man he said in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God you need that one it'll be on in a few minutes the son of man why would it show the son of man why would he be dealing with son of man instead of dealing with son of God come on there's got to be something happen further than son of God now listen John before you say anything else I want you to know who I am who was he he was the son of the Living God he was Almighty God he was the son of the Living God that's why Peter when he said that Jesus immediately said upon this rock I'll build my church not on the revelation of Son of Man because that was a step that Jesus asked him who to man say I the Son of man I am but Peter immediately says thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God you are Almighty God in human flesh what else could he have stated because he didn't understand the Son of Man and Jesus immediately spoke back and said he said listen you got part of what I said I asked you who I am you said it right I am the son of God I'm Almighty God I'm showing you that but you didn't answer what I asked about the sort of man none of the writers wrote of the son of man now I'm not going through Matthew Mark Luke and John will you to say well they said that Matthew Mark Luke yeah they said it Matthew Mark Luke and John a son of man but then it none of their writings take John's writings after the book of John was written take which one was an original Luke and which were the other one of the two was Luke and Mark were not even original disciples but Peter and John never wrote anything else about the Son of Man there was at least two of them in one art now I've asked you this question over and over and the greatest of all was the old-timey none of those people back there was the Apostle Paul and he said not one word about the son of me but immediately a prophet comes on the scene in the 40s and he immediately starts speaking of son of man because he knew that son of God you've got the seven churches the Spirit of God dwelling in the seven churches but remember the point we're trying to get out one in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the Son of Man well there's no way to bring and put a physical man there because of the way the scriptures are written you've got to put the feminist Park all right so let's go ahead and read the scripture what was it can you pull up back up facing the brothers first way off rolled it back up and I turned to see the voice that spiked with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man what clothed with a garment down to the foot okay and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle we're gonna read what the prophet said that's a feminist all right and then he describes his hair and the whiteness and and then the Thetis Bryce and then he comes down and he falls down to worshiping that one that was dire that was shown was one lock under the son of mine okay he said well what okay alright let's just read it go ahead number three in other words right to things now John getting the point while they're coming up with that I want you to know who I am if you got that right I'm the Christ the Son of the Living God I'm the Almighty I'm the god of I'm the beginning the ending I'm that which was which is and shall come I'm all of it and I am the son of God but then he turns here and he says uh-huh one like unto the Son of man now Jesus on earth answered their question I don't know when I'm coming I don't understand that it's withholding from me to be able to express its withholding it's not given to me to understand but then when he comes to Patmos look at the first thing John sees are you listening let's get the point looks a lot across his mind is he human thinking jesus said I am the son of God you got that right John or Peter excuse me Peter you got it right that I'm the Christ the Son of the Living God you got it right that I'm one true and living God made manifest and there is no more you've got that right but I didn't ask you that question I asked you who is the son of man I said I know you can't understand it cause it's the time he asked him he didn't have the new birth right and he had the new birth he could have comprehended more at the time Jesus was asking these things there was no new birth involved but he said now I'm going to have to go away and said I'll come back to you run around city not only show them things you know that he had spoken unto them but said he also showed them the future and things you know more into their understanding but none of them know this mystery is what's quiet about sort of man but I ask you to do it that's what gets me people want to make this that or the other out of something would not put it like it is then your profit immediately see there forty seven is the start and I it's forty nine I believe now if I'm wrong this it's within the first two years and then he starts talking about son of man what's the first thing John does on patently I mean the Lord to John don't you know who I am I'm the Christ the Son of the Living God I'm Almighty God he said now we're gonna show you another step because listen because he said when I was with you on earth you couldn't understand it says now we're going to talk about one like unto the Son of Man now we're going to get the answer to the question that asked who the man say i the son of man am and now we're going to get it out of the Book of Revelations so I hope you see that he's still writing it over you say well there is it right now on all the Kate you came out of word so don't get all involved in that the brother Dale's talking about an additions or anything I'm not talking about I'm trying to show you that in the writing is right there in the word you're listening now go back through it listen Jesus said whoever man say I the Son of Man a.m. Peter said die the Christ the Son of the Living God recognizing him to be the very creator the word in brother Adam emphasizes it back to her the word was what created all things in Genesis so there was the Christ the Son of the Living God Almighty God in human flesh standing on earth he said now that's enough for me to hold you to build my church we said I'll return one day and said when I return I'm going to tell you the rest of the story I'm gonna get into the son of man so isn't it odd the first thing that happens in New Genesis I mean it happens in Revelation reminding him of who it is John I want you to know who I am I'm the Christ the Son of the Living God I'm the very creator I'm the the very beginning I am all because I'm God what sitting there there's more to be said because I mentioned it to you when I was with you and said you didn't understand and he lifts him and he said and really I didn't understand you now come on Jesus didn't know when he was coming he didn't know anything about the future of his in the church we got the quotes and the prophets will read it when we get to it won't get it today but that's all right but then immediately it turns from son of God chapter 1 verse 1 through 9 12 and going on through up to 30 up to 12 and then when it strikes into 12 it goes to one lock under the son of man Girt about the paps with a golden girdle now come on I'll get back to this but just to lay the point in that's coming judge because he moves the garment well I just don't jump over to the bat first let's get where we're going because you got to get to paps and get what that is and understand what's taking place all right now let's read what your prophet had to say they've already got it up this would be a great message for you to digest over and over in the word listen to a read okay seven church ages is 1954 now that's the Bible that's what the Spirit said the candlesticks are and the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of man what one like him it's not him physically he's not standing there physically he's there and while in his bride watch one light him who was this his bride so who's seen in revelations 1 verse 12 or 13 right in there when it starts coming who has seen dire one like unto the Son of man thinking that right where Jesus left off now we're gonna learn a little bit about son of man who is this sort of man in the beginning was the word it's the rising her son so listen one lock under the son of man one like him who was this his bride what that was clothed with a garment down to the foot the holiness of Jesus Christ covering her has washed her from our sins with his own blood all right gird about the pouch not a man a woman with a golden girdle what is that the gospel that held the power and glory of God over the body of Christ a thumb-up bride form right so who is this John sees when he says one like unto the Son of Man Girt about the paps and gold and they're gonna he sees Jesus in another form right and it's a bride form okay let's go a little boy why are we not a denomination number four now if you notice so he goes through the candlesticks and the tabernacle and all of the things explaining and comes down seven Church ages a night now if you notice in Revelations one we find that Jesus standing in the seven church ages the seven golden candlesticks when he turned and saw one lakh unto the Son of man standing clothed with how was it it was a bride standing in two candlesticks drawed out now pull that back with a the bride and pull it back with it with the church ages across and there you go you know what this story about this picture that that is the Word of God in Bride form right the Prophet brought that out explained who that was he said look how they pressed down to no ink and made it darker he said there she stands where she's standing she's standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks but it's not portraying her as the Son of Man but portraying her as who he's manifesting himself through that's the point who's he manifested itself through today he's not you're in physical form so he's still rotting you realize every time a person is born into the kingdom of God God is still riding now come on home all right what's the next one go ahead a number five asking them to flop backwards and forward today all right this is taken from in his presence from Jeffersonville 1962 what about the great spirit a great Saint John of Revelation 1:7 when he was show division and looked and heard a voice speaking to him and he turned to see the voice and he saw seven golden candlesticks and one stood in the midst of the seven candlesticks with higher light wool eyes like flame of fire feet like fine rice he was girded with a girdle golden girdle around the paps and he was called the Word of God that's who he is and when he's seen him standing there listen this is what I like you realize that when he saw the bride do you believe that that is the bride when in the midst of seven golden candlesticks like unto the Son of man when your prophet said it was the bride we gave you two quotes it was the bride now to do but do you really believe what that is when he's seen him standing there that glorified state where is he glorified his bride he's glorified in his bride okay now listen in that glorified state go ahead to number 6 let's read these and then we'll quit from Patmos vision paragraph or page 49 I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks John does not say that he turned to see the one whose voice he heard would he turn to see the voice you remember me asking him Wednesday about it see John knew his voice John had lived with him for three and a half years he knew the voice he knew his looking away and he heard the voice huh see my voice is hard to kind of cover 99% of you can catch the first thing quick that I call on the phone you'll say brother Dale even brother John I called him the other day asking how they would do it and he yeah and he said hey brother Dale I mean all I'd said it hello now I know he could look at his phone and get the number off of it but I don't think he's doing it see it's hard to hide a voice all right and see John had lived with this man walk with him ate with him I'm quoting brother Branham I don't think he's in this quote but he was there with him day in and day out and when he heard this voice like a trumpet sounding he knew who that was the surprise was when he turned to see the voice you know in other words he knew that he was going to see him and when he turned to see him he didn't see Jesus standing there he saw him in seven golden candlesticks John's a prophet so we don't have to worry about it he knows he's gonna get to Revelation all right and when he does see and he turned to see the voice the voice and the person are one and the same Jesus is the word who is it John turns to see his voice that was what I was telling you I said cried listening to the old self cause I've never seen it you know in Nevada it was open oh well I was it Paul saw a pillar fire and he called it Lord brother Brent said he wouldn't have called that Lord had he not known that was who it was did you over the old but was you listening to what I'm trying to bring out Paul was blinded and knocked down why couldn't Satan impersonate a pillar of fire he can do it anytime what made Paul say who art thou he Son Jesus whom that person see the voice explained who that was standing there more than the man standing looking at a pillar of fire if he was listening in Wednesday night when he saw that pillar of fire what made him know that that was Jehovah the oh Jesus of the news he said o or soul my persecutors not me telling you exactly who he is persecuted he knew he wouldn't persecuting the Romans or anything I had he knew who he was killing and doing it and he said I'm Jesus that was the surprise to to Paul because that way he knew very little about Jesus right he'd never heard him priest he never been around him at much but he was killing the Christians that were serving Jesus he was holding the man's coat that was stone him Steven and Steven looks up and sees Jesus standing it to Ryan this you say but what I've had to be distraught pillar fire if that pillar fire - never spoke come on hurt when that pillar fire begin to speak back you better remember one day at one time for sure the Bible says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel right it's a voice how you gonna tell the voice turn on the tape they come on folks out in the old days and when they had to sell me it's real I could splice the tape and make him say anything I want him to say I could do that when I first started in this message I could splice those tapes and cut it out and make it and just put it go we had a lot of broke we had to put them back together what are you talking about John hears a voice he knows who that is he doesn't have to turn to see who it is he knows who it is and when he turns he sees seven golden candlesticks and wanting to miss like unto the Son of Man now he knows things is opening up right he knows who he's talking to you understand what I'm saying Paul just saw a pillar of fire and fell down and started work that's what we think about it that could be impersonated but when you put the pillar of fire and your understanding with it and then the force verifies it goes come on when John heard the voice he knew who it was and then when he turned he saw where the next stage of Christianity was at going it was going to the bride of Jesus Christ and short how she was going to be involved and it's showing the son of man to be revealed who is this son of man in the beginning was the word word with God the Word was God come on what if you heard his voice I always like one point the Bible says don't put anything on the mouth of one witness you remember that what is it two or three witnesses right I like it to her that I've got something to anchor it down with Paul how did you know who that was because he told me that I was persecuting me cuz he told me I was doing and I know who I'm persecuting right and he winds up and says well that's gotta be Almighty God he said I'm Jesus the one you're persecuting that solved it it didn't matter how many impersonations could come it didn't matter how much satan could do when you put that voice with the word you never heard his voice oh no we don't hear his voice of profit someone here the divorce well I I differ with you because he was one said it we do but that's alright I know problems I'm gonna argue with you about it but the thing about it is there's the catch to the whole thing will end on this point be careful the voice you hear be careful of the voice you hear not the sound of the voice or who it sounds like right but what does that voice say it's based on what it said more than anything else that's what John dirt when he saw that he wrote down what he saw when in the midst of seven golden kind of thick like under the son of man and he probably put a period on the end of it and said I don't know who that is because now we know where he made his second step John was saying simply we didn't understand him when he was on earth he said evidently he didn't either cuz he couldn't explain it to us which said now here when we've come to Patmos he said we're here for the Word of God called out of the first thing told to John he was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and he said I'm here come on musician he said I'm here to bring forth the things that have been kept away from man but do you know his voice brother Brandon's voice on the tape can be impersonated letters off of a page can be written to say the Prophet said so and so see that's what's the danger point you know what I'm gonna say your honor especially when you're listening see what the voice tears if he take you to another God what are you supposed to do be careful of the voice you hear John hears that voice one more time John Peter knew heard the voice of the Lord Jesus Peter declares a dart to Christ the Son of the Living God you're the very creator you're the very word misspell he says that's alright what said that ain't the full story because there's more to happen he said I don't understand it myself because I don't know when I'm coming the father hadn't made that known we get all involved in that instead of trying to understand anything well the father and the son is one how come he was the father why didn't he know all things do you have the baptism when I go do you know everything ok that stops that yeah but ain't God no he trying to be trying to be straight with the word in the right place and so our didn't it that John immediately after the description if you followed me listen I want you to know who I am alright I am the Christ the Son of the Living God he named off who was he isn't said okay I got that I said now let's go to the next stage John hears a voice turns to see the voice and when he turns to see it he was expecting to see the Lord Jesus standing there and that's who he saw but he saw him in broad form now it's being described what Peter didn't get who demesne the other son of man you say those things are accidental and why did your prophet you answer me that go to your riders go to your scriptures going read none of your writers wrote of the Son of Man oh yeah now they could write what Peter said we Baptists come on first don't go hog wire with me and then I won't with you you know that we Baptist knew the Son of Man was the sign of the resurrection I knew that in a bad desert that the Son of Man was the resurrection sign why code he said I am the resurrection who raised lazarus but we didn't know what it was about well here comes a little old prophet he preaches for a while because he started in his 30s you know in the 30s preaching they recorded it started in 47 I think it's 49 and he starts talking about the Son of Man and tell me bring me one tape that he didn't talk about the son of man in it right you know what I mean he was trying to get us to see who that was until it was so misunderstood till they made him the son of man they made him the son of man he said I am NOT the son of man he said I'm a son of man he said D son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ but yet people won't listen to that they still think that brother branham was these are mine
