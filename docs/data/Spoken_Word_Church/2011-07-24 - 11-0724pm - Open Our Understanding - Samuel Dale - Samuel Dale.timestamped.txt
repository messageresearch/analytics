[25:31] luke the 24th chapter
[25:36] luke the 24th chapter remember
[25:40] now the announcements that the bible
[25:42] study will be the first saturday in
[25:44] august and also that weekend brother

[26:04] didn't get it like this one but uh
[26:06] you know i'm saying this morning brother
[26:08] and said the august presence
[26:10] we'll see august means uh inspiring all
[26:15] or admiration or majestic
[26:19] you know so that was an august presence
[26:21] of majestic it also has to do with
[26:24] uh dignifying about a a rank of a
[26:27] of a person you know in the uh
[26:31] iraq and things because it's called an
[26:33] august lineage

[26:39] president the all
[26:40] these you know the majestic presence of
[26:43] the lord
[26:44] but also he's a very high rank too that

[27:13] that is within our being on ourselves we
[27:15] are worthy of nothing
[27:17] and how no thoughts or whatsoever to be
[27:20] that we could be
[27:21] anything other than what you make us and
[27:24] we thank you

[27:41] we love you and we thank you in jesus
[27:43] name
[27:44] amen and we'll be
[27:48] reading quite a few verses but from luke
[27:51] 24
[27:51] we'll start reading at verse 25. now
[27:54] this is
[27:55] uh when uh cleopas and
[27:58] the other one was going from after the
[28:02] rumor of the resurrection and the things
[28:04] that happened
[28:05] and they were on their road to emmaus
[28:08] and jesus steps out with them because
[28:10] they were real sad and he begins to
[28:12] talk to him and ask him what was going
[28:15] on and then
[28:16] so we'll start reading about verse 25
[28:19] because they said you know that certain
[28:21] of them had seen him and all like that
[28:23] and they were wondering
[28:24] verse 25 then said he unto them o fools
[28:27] and slow of heart to believe all that
[28:29] the prophets have spoken
[28:31] oh not christ have suffered these things
[28:34] and to enter
[28:35] into his glory and beginning at moses
[28:39] and all the prophets he expounded which
[28:41] means
[28:42] to explain or to interpret you know
[28:46] to expound something is to do that all
[28:48] right and beginning at moses and all the
[28:50] prophets he expounded unto them
[28:53] in all the scriptures are things
[28:54] concerning himself
[28:56] now still they sit and see and see and
[28:58] they they drew nine to the village
[29:00] whether they went and he made as though
[29:02] he would have
[29:03] gone further but they constrained him
[29:05] saying abide with us for it is toward
[29:07] evening and the day is far spent
[29:09] and he went into terry with them and it
[29:11] came to pass that he said it meet with
[29:13] them he took bread and blessed it
[29:15] and break and gave it to them and their
[29:17] eyes were opened
[29:19] and they knew him and he vanished out of
[29:22] their sight now
[29:23] get the point there they knew it they
[29:26] knew it was
[29:26] because what he'd done we'll read the
[29:28] minute who's known in the breaking of
[29:30] the bread so
[29:31] you know that's what it says here that
[29:32] happened he he took the bread
[29:34] and break it and they said one to
[29:36] another did not our heart
[29:38] burn within us while he talked with us
[29:41] along the way and while he opened to us
[29:44] the scriptures look at it
[29:50] and they rose up the same hour and
[29:52] returned to jerusalem and found the
[29:53] eleven gathered together and them that
[29:55] were with them
[29:56] saying the lord is risen indeed and hath
[29:59] appeared to sign
[30:01] see they wouldn't believe it
[30:04] they're saying well he appeared to simon
[30:06] simon says he did now we know he did
[30:08] because we sing him all right they got
[30:11] something to say about it right
[30:14] right and they told what things were
[30:16] done
[30:17] in the way and how he was known of them
[30:20] in breaking of bread
[30:24] and they thus as they thus fake jesus
[30:27] himself stood in the midst of them and
[30:29] saith unto them peace be unto you
[30:31] but they were terrified and uprighted
[30:33] and supposed that they had seen a spirit
[30:35] and he said unto them why are you
[30:37] troubled and why do you
[30:39] why do thoughts arise in your hearts
[30:42] behold my hands and my feet that it is i
[30:45] myself
[30:46] handle me and see for a spirit hath not
[30:48] flesh and bone as you
[30:50] you see me have and when he had thus
[30:53] spoken
[30:54] he showed and showed them his hands and
[30:57] his feet so he still had the nail print
[30:58] started right
[31:00] and while they were yet while they yet
[31:03] believed not
[31:04] for joy and wondered he said unto them
[31:07] have you hear any meat in other words
[31:09] get down a little plainly let's
[31:11] let let me show you something you know
[31:13] they gave him a piece of boiled fish and
[31:15] a honeycomb
[31:16] and he took it and did eat before them
[31:19] and he said unto them
[31:20] these are the words which i spake unto
[31:23] you
[31:23] while i was yet with you that all things
[31:26] must be fulfilled which were written in
[31:28] the law of moses
[31:30] and in the prophets and in the psalms
[31:32] concerning
[31:33] me then open he their understanding that
[31:37] they might understand the scriptures
[31:40] he said unto them now here's his opening
[31:42] to him thus it is written and does it
[31:44] before
[31:45] who christ to suffer and to rise from
[31:47] the dead the third day
[31:48] and that repentance and remission of sin
[31:50] should be preached
[31:52] in his name among all nations beginning
[31:55] at jerusalem and your witness of these
[31:57] witnesses of these things you may be
[31:59] seated the lord is
[32:00] blessing to the reading of the word
[32:08] now i spoke here
[32:12] just the other week a little bit about
[32:13] this
[32:15] but i want you to
[32:19] you know pay close attention because
[32:22] according to
[32:24] verse 32 he opened the understanding of
[32:29] the
[32:29] two on the road to emmaus
[32:32] and concerning himself all right
[32:36] and then according to verse 45
[32:39] there he opened the understanding of the
[32:43] the disciples in the you know as they
[32:45] were gathered
[32:46] and everything he opened their
[32:48] understanding of the scriptures
[32:51] all right concerning himself and what he
[32:54] was going to do
[32:56] all right now he didn't open the
[32:58] understanding of all
[33:00] things he opened the understanding of
[33:04] what they needed
[33:05] at the time okay which was to
[33:08] tie with the resurrection and how that
[33:11] what it would be
[33:12] and how that who he would be and how he
[33:14] would have to die
[33:15] and all that he didn't open the whole
[33:18] bible to him
[33:20] because that wouldn't be the way that
[33:21] you're looking at it he opened their
[33:24] understanding of the scriptures
[33:26] concerning himself
[33:28] as to what was there and what was taking
[33:31] place and
[33:32] and all you know and had taken place
[33:35] among them
[33:36] and then he turns around and he says now
[33:37] you're witnesses of these things
[33:39] so they could only be witnesses of the
[33:42] things they had
[33:42] experienced right like i was saying they
[33:46] they you know they they come running
[33:48] back and
[33:49] as they were getting back it's kind of
[33:51] the story would be you'd look at it like
[33:53] when they get back maybe they don't run
[33:55] in immediately and tell
[33:57] what's going on because everybody is so
[33:59] excited and going on
[34:01] and talking about that the resurrection
[34:04] had transpired and
[34:05] and there peter was you know expounding
[34:08] upon it and
[34:09] and telling them that he had seen the
[34:11] lord jesus then they said well
[34:12] let us tell you then they had something
[34:16] personal to do into it
[34:19] of their understanding opened all right
[34:23] now my whole point i made it then and i
[34:25] want to make it now in this
[34:27] as backing up what i said this morning
[34:30] as to the message we were talking about
[34:32] and i want you to think about it this is
[34:36] before the day of pentecost
[34:39] they all right now being before the day
[34:43] of pentecost
[34:45] then see he just opened their
[34:48] understanding
[34:50] of some things all right now
[34:54] uh most everybody thinks and that's you
[34:56] know
[34:57] i'm sorry but i'm just different you you
[35:00] pay
[35:00] attention to most people you think about
[35:02] in the message and they're talking about
[35:05] that the lord opened my understanding
[35:07] and and i'm not
[35:08] saying nothing now i'm just saying it
[35:10] the way i believe
[35:12] that if that's a revelation amen
[35:16] but we can have god to open our
[35:19] understanding of the scriptures
[35:22] all right and that not be
[35:27] the fact that we even have the new birth
[35:29] that's right
[35:30] amen because he done that to the
[35:31] disciples
[35:33] he could open their understanding that
[35:36] they could
[35:37] understand what was going on because we
[35:39] were kind of in a delusion they
[35:41] now back when they were in their uh in
[35:44] their ministry
[35:45] you remember there in matthew that uh
[35:49] jesus well jesus would give a lot of
[35:51] parables right
[35:52] all right and and as he would give a
[35:54] parable to him
[35:56] you know they would sometimes people
[35:58] would catch on to what the parable was
[36:00] and
[36:01] and most of the time they wouldn't right
[36:03] and and then they would ask and even the
[36:06] scripture refers to it that they would
[36:07] ask him privately later
[36:09] you know maybe that night or something
[36:10] you know that later on they would ask
[36:12] him
[36:13] uh what did this parable mean and he
[36:16] would
[36:17] explain it to him all right the parable
[36:20] of the sower the parable of the
[36:21] different things
[36:22] and then one time he said to them he
[36:24] said now it's given
[36:26] unto you that's uh
[36:29] matthew eight nineteen thirteen
[36:32] eleven thirteen eleven i think is
[36:34] thirteen anyhow
[36:36] it's in matthew it was given to the it
[36:39] says given unto
[36:40] you to understand the scriptures right
[36:42] you know the parables right
[36:44] but to these out here that's not given
[36:46] unto them right all right so there must
[36:48] be
[36:49] a a situation in understanding the bible
[36:53] in the correct way that
[36:55] that maybe even because of our own
[36:58] blindness
[36:59] uh we cannot read the bible and get it
[37:02] in the correct
[37:03] understanding now like i said this
[37:05] morning we read it and
[37:06] swore that there was three gods right we
[37:10] we read it and we swore that hell was
[37:12] eternal and
[37:13] and all kind of things and and all of
[37:15] the situations in the bible we
[37:17] we swore by them and said i give you a
[37:19] scripture for them you know
[37:22] well you know that that doesn't
[37:25] necessarily mean it's right you remember
[37:27] one time after
[37:28] uh jesus was talking with some of them
[37:30] and and
[37:31] maybe john was hanging a little close to
[37:33] him and and maybe peter said you know
[37:36] uh something about him or some situation
[37:38] during the scripture
[37:39] and he said what's that to me if he
[37:41] abides till i come
[37:43] well peter you know and i brought around
[37:45] this one it brought this out because we
[37:47] wouldn't have known it because we didn't
[37:48] pay much attention to the bible but
[37:50] peter went around telling the rest of
[37:52] them john ain't going to die
[37:55] you know but john wrote it see
[37:58] and he inserted maybe into his writings
[38:01] to word that they would clarify it real
[38:03] good
[38:04] and he wrote it into his writing and he
[38:06] said how be it
[38:08] he didn't say that john wouldn't die he
[38:11] just said what if it is
[38:12] you know but a saiyan went among the
[38:14] disciples that
[38:16] he wasn't going to die well see he that
[38:18] wasn't what he said
[38:20] all right now i'm wanting to get a point
[38:22] to you
[38:25] see we can have our understanding open
[38:27] and it's opened according to
[38:29] uh uh our uh
[38:33] what would you say uh how much knowledge
[38:36] we have
[38:37] right that's right you know i mean man
[38:40] used to have knowledge years ago
[38:41] that if you travel to a terrific speed
[38:44] of 25 miles an hour
[38:46] that you would just lift up and go off
[38:48] the earth you know
[38:50] well i mean that's what everybody
[38:51] believed
[38:53] because nobody had never been over 25
[38:55] miles an hour so they couldn't nobody
[38:57] say
[38:57] yeah no that's not right i've been over
[38:59] 25 you know
[39:00] and but see didn't it come a day until
[39:03] it happened
[39:04] right well see according to their
[39:06] knowledge that's what they understood
[39:09] in medical science they used to when
[39:11] you've got certain sicknesses or might
[39:13] basically just basically got sick you
[39:15] know and
[39:16] and down and out they just pull a couple
[39:18] of fingernails out and bleeds you find
[39:19] the blood
[39:20] you know and your your body would
[39:22] reproduce itself
[39:24] and in doing that then it would actually
[39:26] heal the body
[39:28] and you would get well well what do you
[39:29] think about that today
[39:31] i mean how many of you got doctor's
[39:33] appointments tomorrow you're going to go
[39:34] into the doctor and he pulled off a
[39:36] couple of toenails and says
[39:38] let her bleed or reach reaches over and
[39:41] gets a scaffold and just wax a little
[39:43] place and
[39:44] he says let it go i i know this happened
[39:47] that my niece
[39:48] uh you know the rh factor that you have
[39:51] and
[39:51] when they were they waited a few days
[39:53] too late to change the blood
[39:55] and they actually uh if they can catch
[39:58] it real quick back in the old days they
[39:59] could change it through the naval cord
[40:01] and but then after then they would have
[40:03] to do it and i remember they cut my
[40:05] little
[40:05] little niece you know just just all over
[40:07] and let her bleed that blood out
[40:09] as they were putting more blood in that
[40:11] was an old medical way
[40:13] now they got shots to give you that
[40:14] takes care of this that or the other but
[40:16] that's the point of what i'm saying
[40:19] our understanding is according to
[40:22] what we our surroundings are are
[40:25] are what we you know what we're
[40:28] affiliated with right right you know to
[40:32] to understand all right see in doing
[40:35] that then apply that to the bible
[40:39] that the bible was written see
[40:43] but man couldn't even understand the
[40:47] natural writing
[40:49] now when it says in the bible
[40:53] jesus wept see
[40:57] well what is the problem see now we
[41:00] ought to know
[41:01] that that mean he cried right well i
[41:04] don't believe he could cry cause he was
[41:06] god
[41:06] if he was god he couldn't cry and that
[41:08] must mean some other word
[41:11] see and then they said if we could get
[41:13] the original greek you know and
[41:15] all of this that and the other and get
[41:17] everything just right
[41:19] we'd have an understanding of the bible
[41:22] the prophets you remember what he said
[41:23] he said
[41:24] surely they had the greek and the things
[41:26] right back when they
[41:27] there was back there you know when
[41:28] things were said and they couldn't
[41:30] understand
[41:31] right and see even to uh you know
[41:34] understanding like in matthew 21 you
[41:37] know that those pharisees
[41:39] at times they caught on they understood
[41:43] at times their understanding of their
[41:45] head knowledge was open
[41:47] and they realized that jesus was talking
[41:50] about
[41:50] them right right
[41:53] see that he was talking about them they
[41:55] had an understanding
[41:57] whereas when they when one guy heard it
[41:59] you know he goes back to the priest and
[42:01] he says
[42:02] well he's talking about this and he's
[42:03] talking about thorns and he's talking
[42:04] about this what's he talking about this
[42:05] and then the other
[42:06] he said i don't know what i'm really
[42:08] talking about because i'm not a clean
[42:10] you know acquainted with all the
[42:11] parables so he says well
[42:14] i'll just go listen to him he goes and
[42:16] sits down and he listens to him and he
[42:18] comes up with it he said
[42:21] he's talking about me and you yeah you
[42:24] know
[42:24] their understanding was open
[42:28] you understand the point i'm making your
[42:31] understanding can be opened without it
[42:33] being a revelation
[42:36] as i said the other day when i was
[42:37] speaking on this a little the oral
[42:39] roberts university has brother brown's
[42:41] incomplete message will they
[42:44] play it out and those students can read
[42:46] it well you know they can read there's
[42:48] just one god just like you read there's
[42:50] one god
[42:51] they can read that hell is not eternal
[42:54] right and they can read all of the
[42:56] things it lays it out
[42:58] and brother branham you know saying when
[43:00] i go check this out get the greek words
[43:02] get this
[43:03] and they go into the big professor and
[43:04] they say professor we found something
[43:07] said this william branham don't believe
[43:09] it hail's eternal
[43:13] we don't discuss that part because we've
[43:16] been taught
[43:18] and we know that
[43:21] hell is eternal and we're not going to
[43:24] listen to it
[43:25] so put that part out and eventually they
[43:28] would put the whole message out right
[43:30] but you understand what i'm getting at
[43:32] yes
[43:34] you can have your understanding open
[43:36] i've always said it
[43:38] this is not something you would come in
[43:39] to study in this message you know this
[43:41] statement has always been
[43:42] that i wish that i had revealed in my
[43:45] heart
[43:46] what i have in my head
[43:49] right the prophet's message the bible
[43:52] and things
[43:52] i wish it was revealed and see i said
[43:55] that and i did to one brother one time
[43:57] and he said
[43:58] what do you mean
[44:02] what do you mean i said well i've done
[44:04] that before i got the new bird
[44:05] he said what do you mean speak to him
[44:08] the new birth we're just reading the
[44:09] bible
[44:11] and getting some understanding
[44:15] you know from that
[44:18] but see that's to me that's not the new
[44:20] birth if it is the pharisees had it
[44:23] that's right they surely knew the exact
[44:27] lettering of the scriptures
[44:29] and the things but like i said they even
[44:31] said we know he's talking about
[44:33] us see so you can have your
[44:36] understanding open
[44:38] and that's what my whole point now whole
[44:40] message
[44:42] all right is what could it be
[44:45] that what we uh have is an understanding
[44:49] that's right or is it a revelation
[44:55] now i say and i won't back up from it
[44:58] and i believe you'll agree
[44:59] that you see people go in the message
[45:01] for quite a while
[45:03] they can even quote it so much verbatim
[45:05] until you're amazed that their
[45:07] their ability to to tell you what
[45:10] brother around has said on a topic or a
[45:12] subject or whatever
[45:14] and yet then you see them later just
[45:16] leave the message
[45:18] you know well there's something wrong if
[45:20] that was revelation
[45:22] how could you leave the message
[45:26] right all right and like my wife says
[45:27] about it she said
[45:29] anybody can take brother randall's
[45:30] message and the bible
[45:32] and study it a while and make a a speech
[45:36] that's you know it would amaze anybody
[45:40] you know
[45:40] and like i say that our children our
[45:43] children could tell the theologians
[45:47] about the revelation of one god
[45:51] what because they read it so much see
[45:54] we've read it for what 50 some people
[45:56] here that be going on to 50 years that
[45:59] you've been around this message
[46:01] it's it's surely been somewhere where to
[46:04] have a little knowledge you know what
[46:05] i'm fixing to say and the way to always
[46:07] say it
[46:08] you know people say well be where are
[46:10] they i'm quoting right around you know
[46:11] be aware of them it's got the answer to
[46:13] everything
[46:13] and i always say well beware of them
[46:15] that's been around 40 50 years ain't got
[46:16] an answer for nothing
[46:18] no i mean that's just you know
[46:22] to me that maybe i shouldn't be that
[46:26] blunt about saying things but why not
[46:28] right because the if it's not revelation
[46:32] it's just intellect right right amen
[46:36] and see then having just an intellectual
[46:38] conception
[46:39] about something it's very dangerous
[46:44] because at that position you will think
[46:46] it's the holy spirit
[46:47] that has quickened it to you now let's
[46:50] go back what we're talking about this
[46:51] morning man
[46:52] right so then by the prophet bringing it
[46:55] to us it was the holy spirit upon the
[46:57] prophet
[46:58] right see the anointing was upon the man
[47:01] to bring us the message
[47:03] the anointing was upon each of these
[47:05] writers that we read of matthew mark
[47:07] luke and
[47:09] you john peters the the anointing was
[47:11] upon them to write
[47:13] what god was saying to us
[47:16] all right that was that anointing but
[47:19] without that anointing inside of us
[47:23] or the anoint anointed god inside of us
[47:26] the new birth
[47:27] then we'll only get an intellectual
[47:29] conception
[47:30] and no matter how much intellectualism
[47:33] you get
[47:34] even if you've got it to work that it's
[47:36] perfect
[47:37] uh brother george let's see brother
[47:40] uh thomas might remember who it was
[47:42] brother george his brother
[47:44] um mo and brother tatum and them i think
[47:47] was talking to a man from some
[47:48] uh what bob jones university was it
[47:51] seemed like it was some university
[47:53] that the guy came down to actually try
[47:55] to you know talk them out of the true
[47:57] one
[47:58] one true living god and you know and he
[48:01] could quote the entire bible by memory
[48:05] now that's wonderful i mean i wish i had
[48:09] it
[48:10] but it's like i said this morning i
[48:11] can't carly quote john 3 16.
[48:13] you said no i don't want to be ashamed
[48:15] but i am
[48:17] but i've never tried to learn it by
[48:19] memory
[48:20] i tried to read it to see what is being
[48:23] said to me
[48:27] and that way then i i want it that way
[48:31] but see it didn't matter if we could if
[48:32] we could get it all you know
[48:35] satan he has a great understanding
[48:42] a great understanding
[48:46] of the bible but does that make him born
[48:48] again
[48:51] i mean you try to quote within the
[48:52] message he knows it
[48:55] i gave you one quote in our word this
[48:57] man wrote around and said that he had
[48:59] the understanding of the bible or
[49:00] understanding of the word
[49:02] to tell the eve in other words right
[49:07] he had things back there that we
[49:08] wouldn't think about
[49:11] he had a knowledge of the principles of
[49:13] life and what it would consist of
[49:15] and how the the the egg and the germ
[49:17] would mix between the beast and eve
[49:19] right he had a lot of understanding
[49:23] and anytime you think you can out quote
[49:24] the devil you're in bad shape
[49:27] you know because he knows it
[49:30] but he only knows it the prophet said by
[49:33] intellectual conception
[49:37] you don't know it by holy ghost
[49:38] experience well
[49:40] now that don't put it see when you start
[49:42] talking like that people say
[49:44] well what do you mean you don't want us
[49:45] to read the bible you want us to be
[49:46] illiterate
[49:47] i didn't say that now right
[49:51] i didn't say you need to be illiterate
[49:54] because the bible says
[49:56] study to show yourself a proof a workman
[49:59] that needeth not to be ashamed
[50:01] rightly dividing the word of truth right
[50:04] exactly
[50:05] so then don't don't go into the state of
[50:08] confusion
[50:09] when i'm trying to speak just go with
[50:11] what i'm talking about and listen
[50:13] don't get out ahead of me see that's the
[50:15] worst thing in the world you get out
[50:16] ahead of the preacher
[50:18] and you get out ahead of me a lot of
[50:19] times you get your limb sawed off you've
[50:20] done that so don't do it
[50:22] because you think i'm going this way and
[50:23] i don't know that way all right but now
[50:26] just think about what we're trying to
[50:27] say
[50:29] see jesus according to the scriptures
[50:34] had not been crucified according to john
[50:36] 7
[50:37] 38 39 and he the scripture said
[50:41] of that said out of your belly shall
[50:43] flow
[50:44] rivers of living water referring to the
[50:47] day of pentecost when it would come
[50:49] right but see
[50:53] they couldn't understand that why
[50:56] because at that time if you go on
[50:57] reading there it says
[50:59] because the holy ghost had not been
[51:01] given
[51:02] because jesus had not been glorified
[51:06] all right so you can have your
[51:08] understanding opened
[51:10] and listen that's the only way you know
[51:12] how that i preached all of
[51:14] everybody's ever been around here
[51:15] anytime at all well the older ones with
[51:17] us
[51:18] i've always taught you that we must have
[51:20] the seat so
[51:21] down in the field before the rain can
[51:23] fall on it
[51:25] you know i mean you know you stand there
[51:28] and you got your seat in your hand he
[51:29] said boy bless look
[51:30] look at my corn man
[51:34] look at my corn you don't see my corn
[51:37] right no put it in the ground all right
[51:40] sow the seeds let the rain come and then
[51:42] we'll be we'll see you've got corn
[51:45] see all right see
[51:48] but has god opened our understanding
[51:54] you know to the scriptures or is it
[51:58] revealed to us
[51:59] right now let me illustrate then
[52:02] brother branham had the opening of his
[52:04] understanding of the scriptures to be
[52:06] able to tie together things
[52:07] and all but yet until the holy spirit
[52:10] spoke to him
[52:12] he believed that the white horse rider
[52:14] was the holy ghost
[52:15] and that's your prophet ma'am but see
[52:19] don't you think he had a great
[52:20] understanding
[52:23] he read continually don't you think he
[52:25] understood
[52:27] but yet there was something there that
[52:28] was withholding from him
[52:31] now could it be that away with you and i
[52:33] amen right
[52:34] see i wrote it this way there's a vast
[52:36] difference between having an
[52:37] understanding open
[52:39] and having a revelation right of what
[52:43] is understood there's a vast difference
[52:46] in it
[52:46] right and that way as i said you can
[52:48] tell it because a revelation will
[52:50] keep you but head knowledge will just
[52:53] lead you to more head knowledge
[52:57] yeah you know it just keep blowing you
[52:59] up and you'll start trying to figure out
[53:00] words and
[53:01] figure out why this and why that or like
[53:04] we said this morning you know then
[53:05] you'll
[53:06] read the scripture and you'll say see
[53:08] there the bible said i don't need
[53:10] nobody to teach me the holy ghost is my
[53:14] teacher
[53:18] but see why did he put teachers in the
[53:21] body
[53:22] right if the holy ghost is only the
[53:24] things you need all right then it's like
[53:26] i said you know i know i'm
[53:28] i know that when i talk i talk blunt
[53:31] that way you don't misunderstand me i
[53:33] don't think there's anybody
[53:34] now you might not know what i'm saying
[53:36] you might understand what i'm saying i'm
[53:38] trying to get it
[53:38] but you think one thing about it you
[53:40] don't misunderstand my language
[53:43] go see then if god can quicken it
[53:50] we don't have to worry about it but if
[53:53] he don't quicken it
[53:54] it's just his knowledge that's right
[53:57] it's a concept or a thought while we run
[54:00] around and make this statement
[54:01] he said i don't believe that we're
[54:03] getting the people to christ
[54:07] we're getting them to a church he said
[54:10] that's right all right may i phrase it
[54:12] on we're getting into a doctrine
[54:14] we're getting them to an idea but if all
[54:17] you have is head knowledge
[54:19] about a doctrinal situation somebody can
[54:22] come along
[54:23] and convince you different of that he
[54:26] can show you where this greek word means
[54:27] this and that greek word means that and
[54:28] you put your punctuation here and you
[54:30] put the digits in and when you wind up
[54:33] well that's great and like i told you i
[54:36] didn't have the baptism in the holy
[54:38] ghost
[54:40] and brother mo all he had to say to me
[54:41] he said what do you believe that's a bad
[54:43] disbelief and one god
[54:46] he said explain it to me i said god
[54:48] three persons blessed trinity
[54:50] he said your as trinitarian as
[54:52] everything else is
[54:53] because to be a person as a personality
[54:55] personality is an individual individual
[54:57] to person
[54:59] well you know i didn't have to i didn't
[55:01] get mad and run to the books and read
[55:04] and try to find out what dr show and
[55:06] show said about it or
[55:07] who said about it or whatever or what
[55:09] school i looked at him i said well don't
[55:11] believe that no more
[55:13] i didn't know what to believe maybe but
[55:16] i didn't believe that
[55:17] right i never did no more i have been
[55:19] believing god in three persons
[55:21] because he doesn't prove his point to me
[55:23] all right see then that way
[55:25] see our understanding can be opened
[55:30] but we need the revelation see
[55:34] we can have the mechanics as brother
[55:36] branham will describe it are the words
[55:38] shown down in our heart
[55:40] but we need the dynamics the disciples
[55:42] had the word
[55:44] david even it says thy word have i hid
[55:47] in my heart
[55:49] that i might not sin against the david
[55:51] love
[55:52] god's word they loved that word so much
[55:56] back there in the old testament one time
[55:57] until they found a scroll
[55:59] that they didn't know existed and the
[56:01] bible said they stood for six
[56:04] hours while they read that scroll
[56:07] and they worshipped six hours that was
[56:10] people that's not even born again
[56:13] right man because there's no way to be
[56:15] born again in the old testament jesus
[56:17] christ that died yet
[56:18] that's right that's what i've given you
[56:19] that john 7 there
[56:21] because he hadn't been glorified numbers
[56:23] had been crucified
[56:26] see then could it be that what we have
[56:28] mostly
[56:29] is an understanding all right now don't
[56:33] don't misunderstand me we've got to have
[56:37] the
[56:37] understanding
[56:42] it's not revelation first right it's not
[56:45] that you pick up the bible
[56:47] oh man i see that
[56:50] you know you pick up a prophecy and
[56:52] that's what gets me you know and i'm
[56:54] sorry
[56:54] but i try to emphasize it to hit you
[56:58] but people tell you boys when i i read
[57:00] that and that's
[57:01] it i just picked up a book and i read
[57:04] and god revealed it right there
[57:07] and i see it well why has everybody else
[57:09] fought it out for 40 years
[57:12] you know i mean you know and i'm not
[57:14] saying it don't happen
[57:16] right i'm just saying it didn't happen
[57:18] to me
[57:22] but you see we need the word shown down
[57:24] in us those disciples had that word
[57:27] by the lord jesus now
[57:31] that's what people say you know i'm
[57:33] gonna stay home and listen to tapes
[57:35] and i'm not gonna do nothing just listen
[57:37] to brother and i'll get first hand
[57:38] well the disciples got three and a half
[57:40] years of firsthand
[57:42] information from a man they could
[57:43] question about what he was talking about
[57:46] and they still wound up with no
[57:48] understanding you agree
[57:51] they wound up at the end of it and
[57:52] didn't know what in the world he was
[57:53] talking about that's right
[57:57] and he has explained it to him
[58:01] it expounded on it and that's what he
[58:04] done with the disciples
[58:05] he opened their understanding but that
[58:09] didn't give him the new birth
[58:10] well brother dale you know i studied the
[58:13] message i believe i got the holy ghost
[58:15] because what's in me agrees with the
[58:16] word well it's okay
[58:18] if it keeps on agreeing amen
[58:25] preach the message right preachers we
[58:27] don't talk about the leftists
[58:29] i get on the preachers i don't worry
[58:31] about the laity i don't have no trouble
[58:32] with laity i have trouble with preaching
[58:34] it
[58:35] but you see preachers 30 40 years that
[58:37] they've been in this message
[58:38] hunted fished and lived basically with
[58:41] the prophet or something
[58:43] and then you see of the worst confused
[58:45] people has ever been about what the
[58:46] prophet had to say
[58:58] because i exposed it
[59:02] but people don't realize who the ones
[59:03] that you expose is the problem
[59:06] you know but you see
[59:09] i've been accused of being an
[59:11] intellectual
[59:14] why after 40 years why would you be
[59:15] intellectual
[59:17] i don't mind saying that after 40 years
[59:20] you study one message
[59:26] but could it be that we
[59:30] we read over it
[59:34] right and still that's a point too
[59:38] you know it's not time to understand
[59:40] something you know what you get it and
[59:42] you read over it
[59:44] the message has now of course they're
[59:46] changing a whole lot of it we
[59:47] we find that out with the computer
[59:48] systems and things and if everybody here
[59:51] was on to the new version of
[59:53] that they have out from jeffersonville
[59:55] i'd click over to it to bring any quotes
[59:56] from it
[59:57] because there is a better opportunity so
[59:59] we have to use two versions our computer
[1:00:01] system will not handle the old version
[1:00:03] and put it on the internet so we have to
[1:00:05] translate it
[1:00:05] into the new version of it to be able to
[1:00:09] take it out onto the to the internet
[1:00:11] system right
[1:00:12] so you know so i started today happy and
[1:00:15] richard and him that's what jonah has to
[1:00:16] do see i give them a quote
[1:00:18] from something i give them one in this
[1:00:19] it's a
[1:00:21] page 26 revelation of jesus christ
[1:00:24] we'll see then they've got to go run
[1:00:25] that into the computer and there
[1:00:27] under the new message because it won't
[1:00:30] accept this part
[1:00:32] to be able to put it on the iron so you
[1:00:33] know a lot of things in understanding
[1:00:35] but still i'm not arguing with nobody i
[1:00:37] just said we all had it
[1:00:38] i found a lot of misunderstandings
[1:00:40] between it and
[1:00:42] found like even studying on this message
[1:00:44] if you run in
[1:00:45] uh open open our understanding
[1:00:48] you'll find more under the new version
[1:00:50] than you do under the old
[1:00:52] but you'll also find that they change
[1:00:54] some words
[1:00:56] and they use opening instead of open
[1:01:01] me and you know they'll change in to buy
[1:01:05] or something because they're upgrading
[1:01:08] the best they can do and i'm not arguing
[1:01:09] with nobody i'm just telling you all
[1:01:11] right
[1:01:11] i'm telling you that's what we do with
[1:01:13] understanding
[1:01:14] understanding is progressively uh
[1:01:18] progressing what is it understanding
[1:01:20] would be progressive knowledge
[1:01:22] in other words you keep on growing and
[1:01:24] going you know and understanding
[1:01:27] uh we didn't need to know how to fly an
[1:01:29] airplane a hundred years ago
[1:01:32] i mean the wright brothers was just
[1:01:33] beginning to talk about it
[1:01:35] and if you heard the story about it
[1:01:37] their daddy took them out of a meeting
[1:01:38] where this guy prophesied that they
[1:01:40] would
[1:01:40] one day they would come forth somebody
[1:01:42] and they would fly through the sky and
[1:01:44] they said that daddy got to took these
[1:01:46] two boys out of the building that's what
[1:01:47] was told now and you don't want to argue
[1:01:49] on whatever right
[1:01:50] you know the two guys that did start the
[1:01:52] playing later but
[1:01:54] the the point i'm trying to get it is we
[1:01:56] believe in progressive understanding
[1:01:59] all right now if do let me ask you do
[1:02:02] you believe this
[1:02:04] do you believe in progressive revelation
[1:02:06] not added revelation
[1:02:08] right no no no no no not different
[1:02:10] revelation
[1:02:11] progressive right something being
[1:02:14] revealed to you here and then later more
[1:02:15] on it more on it more
[1:02:17] well then if it is that means you're
[1:02:18] going to have to have progressive
[1:02:20] understanding
[1:02:21] right right right i mean that's simple
[1:02:24] right
[1:02:25] progressive revelation would require
[1:02:27] progressive understanding
[1:02:28] you know or grow development and all
[1:02:31] like that that's what we're doing here
[1:02:33] see but now while we're on that part
[1:02:36] where i won't forget it because it's in
[1:02:37] my mind
[1:02:38] then it is i've tried to preach to you
[1:02:41] that if we don't have the word stoned
[1:02:43] down correctly my brother brown would be
[1:02:45] so
[1:02:46] um he said so zealous of the word that
[1:02:48] he had sown
[1:02:49] right he said to sort down pure and
[1:02:51] unadulterated that's what it i think
[1:02:53] it's uh what it spoken words written and
[1:02:54] said he said the seed has been sewn down
[1:02:56] pure and unadulterated
[1:02:57] from all mankind all right now
[1:03:01] you know at that time he made that
[1:03:02] statement was 1962
[1:03:05] and at that time he didn't know the
[1:03:06] white horse writer
[1:03:11] was the antichrist he didn't know that
[1:03:13] was 63.
[1:03:14] see so his understanding was
[1:03:17] progressive as he came along
[1:03:21] all right see the bible even said jesus
[1:03:23] grow to grace and knowledge
[1:03:24] all right now but get that's why i think
[1:03:27] that
[1:03:28] we don't see things maybe you don't look
[1:03:30] at it like i do because
[1:03:31] see jesus goes out and he gets baptized
[1:03:33] he goes out into the wilderness
[1:03:34] you know in the desert and he comes back
[1:03:36] and when he comes back
[1:03:38] then he walks into the temple one day
[1:03:39] and and they handed him a book and he
[1:03:44] did he set personal let's see what am i
[1:03:47] going to read
[1:03:51] no he probably opened it up right right
[1:03:54] there
[1:03:54] and he looked down and he realized
[1:03:56] they're 62
[1:03:58] or 61 that which one it is there you
[1:04:00] know where it says the spirit of the
[1:04:01] lord is upon me
[1:04:03] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:04:04] the gospel right
[1:04:06] he folds the book he lays it down as i
[1:04:08] said this morning i had those in the
[1:04:10] notes this morning to bring
[1:04:11] the greatest anointing of all was there
[1:04:14] sitting in the temple
[1:04:16] and what did it say precious words
[1:04:18] proceeded forth from it he went running
[1:04:19] all over the building shouting glory
[1:04:21] hallelujah
[1:04:22] he was sitting down talking to him the
[1:04:24] prophet i gave you the quotes this
[1:04:25] morning
[1:04:26] anointing is supreme power in control
[1:04:30] see we call it shouting it's all right
[1:04:32] when you shout
[1:04:34] it's like i like what the prophet said
[1:04:36] he said it's okay to shout
[1:04:38] and jump up in the air he said but make
[1:04:40] sure you walk straight when you come
[1:04:42] back down
[1:04:43] see that's not quoted a lot all right
[1:04:46] they quote the shout out to glory
[1:04:47] hallelujah you know but they don't quote
[1:04:49] that you know
[1:04:50] make sure you walk straight now if you
[1:04:53] got the holy ghost see you're going to
[1:04:54] walk straight
[1:04:56] you see him i can't get away from the
[1:04:57] morning's message
[1:04:59] all right so brother branham
[1:05:03] covers i gave you three quotes there
[1:05:05] about the opening of the understanding
[1:05:07] so you can read those as you go along
[1:05:09] that he opened the understanding of the
[1:05:11] disciples
[1:05:13] you know the lord jesus did he even uses
[1:05:16] the word expounded on the one that's
[1:05:18] the one called a court trial 1964 even
[1:05:21] says he expounded upon the scriptures
[1:05:25] all right now he opened their
[1:05:27] understanding of the scriptures
[1:05:30] now listen that didn't give them the new
[1:05:32] birth
[1:05:35] but you know what
[1:05:39] had he not opened their understanding of
[1:05:40] the scriptures they could not have
[1:05:42] gotten a new birth
[1:05:43] right it was not because they happened
[1:05:48] to wind up in a room
[1:05:50] and they said where are you going
[1:05:51] tonight you got something to eat yeah
[1:05:53] we're going to an upper room sit down
[1:05:54] these i think i'll go along with you
[1:05:58] not knowing nothing about what's going
[1:05:59] on no no no no no
[1:06:02] you've heard the prophet said they were
[1:06:05] up there
[1:06:06] maybe one of them said i think we've got
[1:06:07] it
[1:06:09] we know we've got our commission healed
[1:06:11] of sick cast out devils preach the
[1:06:12] gospel
[1:06:14] let's go do it and said one of them said
[1:06:17] yeah but said what jesus said
[1:06:20] hasn't taken place yet
[1:06:25] so they had their understanding opened
[1:06:27] as to what they were to be
[1:06:32] and how they would have a ministry and
[1:06:34] what it was to bring
[1:06:37] but they did not have the revelation of
[1:06:40] jesus christ dwelling within them
[1:06:43] but had they not had it shown down
[1:06:46] that's my point now listen
[1:06:48] that's why it's required then and i
[1:06:51] didn't write this bible
[1:06:52] nor the prophets made it but it's
[1:06:55] required
[1:06:56] that we believe in a five-fold ministry
[1:07:01] see it's required it's not something
[1:07:02] that we can take or leave
[1:07:04] right i didn't make the statements
[1:07:06] brother said that the faculty minister
[1:07:08] for the perfecting of the saints right
[1:07:11] all right then if somebody don't throw
[1:07:14] that word down
[1:07:16] it can't be quickened that's right is
[1:07:19] that sensible or not
[1:07:20] people call me deep now how deep is that
[1:07:26] simplicity is the deep end of anything
[1:07:32] now you think it goes either way don't
[1:07:33] don't that's right god is hidden and
[1:07:35] revealed in
[1:07:36] simplicity as you go down right
[1:07:41] i grew up right simplicity
[1:07:44] is intellectual
[1:07:49] no i don't have no intellect i got the
[1:07:51] holy ghost
[1:07:53] it's all right go ahead
[1:07:57] but you see now with all behind and what
[1:08:00] i've said that even brutal branham
[1:08:04] thought his understanding was opened
[1:08:07] and thought the white horse rider was
[1:08:09] the holy ghost
[1:08:11] well yet when it was revealed it wasn't
[1:08:14] correct
[1:08:17] see he didn't come in there and said
[1:08:18] well bless god i tell you what i'm still
[1:08:20] going to believe what i'm going to
[1:08:20] believe no
[1:08:21] he took what the holy spirit had to say
[1:08:27] and he said here it is my point is this
[1:08:32] there is show me anywhere now i want
[1:08:34] somebody i challenge you in the bible
[1:08:37] show me anywhere in the bible that they
[1:08:39] receive the holy ghost without hearing
[1:08:40] the message
[1:08:45] anybody can find it bring it to me
[1:08:49] any word in the bible if they receive
[1:08:50] the holy ghost without first hearing a
[1:08:52] message
[1:08:55] right that's why i tried to explain the
[1:08:58] day of pentecost is what brother brown
[1:09:00] would say i met people got the holy
[1:09:01] ghost 50 years before
[1:09:03] just like the day of pentecost why
[1:09:04] because in the upper room you had a
[1:09:06] group of people
[1:09:06] that had been tutored and trained for
[1:09:08] three and a half years and had their
[1:09:09] understanding open
[1:09:10] and the holy ghost fell and it gave them
[1:09:12] what we call the faith of the fathers
[1:09:14] which is right here not that headstone
[1:09:16] now that's love and
[1:09:17] i mean not it see all right but see when
[1:09:20] the holy ghost fell on the 3000 outside
[1:09:23] it could only give them the new birth
[1:09:25] that faith
[1:09:27] because they didn't have the word of
[1:09:29] understanding
[1:09:31] see what's happened happening all these
[1:09:33] years god
[1:09:34] has been opening our understanding of
[1:09:37] the scriptures
[1:09:39] at least he has mine i mean that's
[1:09:41] that's the way i do and why i preach it
[1:09:43] away
[1:09:43] that's why i'll preach something and
[1:09:44] then i'll come back years later and i'll
[1:09:46] pick it up and go on up a step or two
[1:09:49] and sometimes i'll go up one step and
[1:09:51] sometimes i go four or five
[1:09:52] but you know that's what i believe
[1:09:56] right i believe in progressive
[1:09:57] revelation and i come and tell you what
[1:09:59] god has
[1:10:00] said to me all right see then that way
[1:10:03] our understanding is open
[1:10:05] it doesn't mean that it's revealed
[1:10:08] see the mechanics is the showing down of
[1:10:11] the word
[1:10:13] the opening of your understanding
[1:10:16] it's the mechanics the word
[1:10:20] being read and understood and really
[1:10:23] getting to the basis
[1:10:24] i'm like this i've come to the basis
[1:10:26] that brother branham said certain things
[1:10:28] and that there's no other way he could
[1:10:30] have said it beside that
[1:10:33] i hear people say well he should have
[1:10:34] said this and he should have said that
[1:10:35] he should have the order said
[1:10:37] no he could have said no other way amen
[1:10:41] because that's what it means that was
[1:10:44] what god wanted so it's the bible that
[1:10:46] way
[1:10:48] but we need somebody to
[1:10:51] open our understanding now that's where
[1:10:53] you find full ministry comes in
[1:10:57] now if anybody out there any word surely
[1:11:00] would have any idea that brother dale is
[1:11:01] against people reading and studying the
[1:11:03] message
[1:11:03] you come and talk to these people that
[1:11:05] are sitting here where i tell them you
[1:11:07] are to read
[1:11:08] and study the bible more than i do you
[1:11:11] ought to know more about this message
[1:11:12] than i know about it
[1:11:14] because you don't have to study for a
[1:11:16] sermon
[1:11:18] you can just read i have to read related
[1:11:21] to what i'm going to preach on
[1:11:23] and then on a rare occasion i get to
[1:11:25] read a book or listen to a tape
[1:11:26] see because you know i'm studying in a
[1:11:30] line and i want to keep it in that line
[1:11:33] and that's why when i preach it that i
[1:11:35] don't worry about getting
[1:11:37] you know garbage back off the internet
[1:11:39] well you missed it here and you missed
[1:11:40] it there
[1:11:41] i'm sure one of these days they'll do it
[1:11:42] but hadn't done it yet
[1:11:44] and you know out there as much as it is
[1:11:47] that they sure love to do it
[1:11:50] but that's the point now not if we're
[1:11:51] that good it's the holy ghost is that
[1:11:53] good
[1:11:54] he's the one that's protected us not me
[1:11:58] he's been the holy ghost but see you
[1:12:00] must hear the word before the word can
[1:12:02] be quickened that's right
[1:12:08] you somebody's got to preach it that's
[1:12:09] where the preacher comes in
[1:12:12] how can we hear the bible saying without
[1:12:14] a preacher
[1:12:16] right is that bible that's right
[1:12:19] but see you don't hear the preacher
[1:12:20] quote the rest of it
[1:12:23] he wants to quote that end of it but the
[1:12:25] rest of it says
[1:12:27] if he'd be sin
[1:12:30] how can he preach unless he's sent
[1:12:35] you know to say they just got went but
[1:12:37] that's just jokes where they not even
[1:12:39] make about the bible
[1:12:41] but you see if somebody don't preach it
[1:12:45] to us
[1:12:48] we can't get an opening of our
[1:12:49] understanding right that's right
[1:12:55] well i just read the prophet
[1:12:59] well amen
[1:13:04] like i told a man one time i said he's
[1:13:05] telling me about you know how that these
[1:13:07] people just listening to the tastes it's
[1:13:09] fine i said you show me a church
[1:13:10] listening to taste
[1:13:12] only listen to tapes and i'll show you
[1:13:13] backslidden bunch of people and i don't
[1:13:15] mean backstage it's not going to church
[1:13:18] that's automatic but i said i'll show
[1:13:21] you about to live much people
[1:13:24] i said you want to argue the point he
[1:13:27] said my brother is
[1:13:28] i said yep his backslid
[1:13:32] he finally said yeah you're right
[1:13:35] yeah yep all right that's what i'm
[1:13:39] saying
[1:13:40] people without someone to help us what
[1:13:43] is it and uh
[1:13:46] phillip with ethiopian unit
[1:13:49] right now he was reading the scrolls
[1:13:54] of isaiah and he said is this man
[1:13:56] talking about himself or another
[1:14:00] reading understanding open right
[1:14:04] he just simply told him what that meant
[1:14:07] you said told me what yeah it meant
[1:14:08] exactly what it said
[1:14:14] it says you know where the bible just
[1:14:15] plain saying like this say in the last
[1:14:17] days i'll pour out my spirit upon all
[1:14:19] flesh
[1:14:21] your sons and daughters do this and my
[1:14:23] handmaids will do this
[1:14:24] see your sons antichrist serpent seed
[1:14:31] because the spirit's poured out now
[1:14:34] upon all flesh anointed ones
[1:14:40] brother branham didn't change that
[1:14:42] reading you know
[1:14:46] he changed our understanding of what we
[1:14:50] had read
[1:14:52] you agree yes right that's what we
[1:14:55] needed to change our understanding
[1:14:57] we read it and swore oh wait man we took
[1:15:00] that bible
[1:15:01] we swore that was three gods oh look at
[1:15:03] that look at that look at that look at
[1:15:05] that
[1:15:08] we swore by them being three gods
[1:15:14] now we can swear by they're just being
[1:15:16] one
[1:15:18] but is what's changed is it a revelation
[1:15:23] or just an intellect that you got just a
[1:15:26] head knowledge
[1:15:28] the prophet of god said pray for a
[1:15:30] revelation
[1:15:31] he said you need revelation more than
[1:15:33] you need anything
[1:15:35] pray for a revelation all right see
[1:15:38] like i told you one time i had something
[1:15:40] came up and and i had notes written for
[1:15:43] to preach on a message and uh
[1:15:48] i was getting ready to preach it and i
[1:15:49] would have challenged anybody because i
[1:15:51] had the quote had the bible and
[1:15:52] everything
[1:15:54] and god didn't argue with me he didn't
[1:15:57] talk to me
[1:15:58] you know what he said
[1:16:02] now this is all he said he said if you
[1:16:05] do that you
[1:16:06] make your type greater than your
[1:16:07] antitype
[1:16:10] that's all he said
[1:16:13] he didn't explain to me what he was
[1:16:15] talking about he didn't explain the
[1:16:17] scriptures that i had
[1:16:19] messed up he didn't show me anything
[1:16:21] like that he just told me
[1:16:23] if you do that you'll get your type will
[1:16:25] be greater than your antitype
[1:16:28] well see how can you type be greater
[1:16:30] than your anatomy your type is like a
[1:16:32] a canoe you know and an anti-top is like
[1:16:35] an ocean liner you know
[1:16:37] see you know the the blood of a lamb
[1:16:40] is a type of the blood of jesus christ
[1:16:42] see if you go you go backwards you
[1:16:44] you've got a problem
[1:16:46] you're trying to go back you'd want you
[1:16:48] wouldn't want to go out there to segment
[1:16:49] noon and get in a
[1:16:50] an old t model now donnie would but you
[1:16:53] know he's just that away
[1:16:55] he'd go right home to t modeled and and
[1:16:57] then a cadillac
[1:16:59] but that's his way he didn't get a
[1:17:01] little older he won't care nothing about
[1:17:02] it
[1:17:03] he wants our conditioner turned on
[1:17:07] but listen
[1:17:12] the anointing of the holy spirit
[1:17:16] wouldn't it be then i'm asking you the
[1:17:19] question
[1:17:21] wouldn't it be then that the anointing
[1:17:23] of the holy spirit would be on our
[1:17:24] intellectualism
[1:17:27] and that would be why we would be called
[1:17:29] in anointed ones
[1:17:33] is it not true that brother branham says
[1:17:35] that they take
[1:17:37] part of the word and make it work is
[1:17:39] that a quote
[1:17:42] okay
[1:17:44] even your uh uh deals of
[1:17:48] spiritualism we have been told and i've
[1:17:52] witnessed a little bit but not just
[1:17:53] talking with people
[1:17:55] but brother brown said it they travel in
[1:17:57] the three high names father son and holy
[1:17:59] ghost
[1:18:00] you know they're based on the bible
[1:18:04] they've got an understanding made of
[1:18:06] this scripture but then they take it to
[1:18:08] themselves and then make it spiritualism
[1:18:12] what about it but get the point now how
[1:18:15] can we hear without a preacher
[1:18:18] and how can he preach unless he be sin
[1:18:21] if he don't have the holy spirit within
[1:18:23] him
[1:18:23] to be able to bring it out then all of
[1:18:26] his expounding upon it
[1:18:29] will not do any good because i've asked
[1:18:32] you this question many times
[1:18:34] how can the holy spirit quicken error
[1:18:37] when your prophet says it can't be done
[1:18:39] that's right
[1:18:41] that shouldn't need a revelation to
[1:18:42] think he would quick an arrow you know i
[1:18:44] heard a man one time he said boy i
[1:18:46] shouted over the trinity and i shouted
[1:18:47] the truth
[1:18:48] i said well you're shouting
[1:18:52] that was good but i'd hate to make the
[1:18:55] statement i shouted over the trinity
[1:18:57] you know to think it was right see
[1:19:00] but see we need somebody
[1:19:05] to take the message and and break it
[1:19:09] down
[1:19:09] to us as to understanding it now that's
[1:19:13] what
[1:19:13] brother brown said and brother ray give
[1:19:15] me the quote that's on
[1:19:16] what is it because i should have brought
[1:19:18] it but he said these young men will take
[1:19:20] this and sweep it on to the coming of
[1:19:21] the lord
[1:19:23] that's right things that are to be
[1:19:25] brought around said that these young men
[1:19:27] will take it and sweep it on to the
[1:19:29] coming of the lord
[1:19:30] you know i'm not qualified much in that
[1:19:32] young anymore it was back then but
[1:19:36] it's all right but he said they'd sweep
[1:19:39] it on
[1:19:39] he said in other words i break it down
[1:19:41] in big nuggets
[1:19:45] he left a job for the fivefold ministry
[1:19:49] that's right he left a job
[1:19:52] and that same anointing that was in the
[1:19:55] lord jesus
[1:19:56] was then brother around speaking it and
[1:19:58] then that must be in the thoughtful
[1:20:00] ministry
[1:20:01] or they won't speak it correctly and if
[1:20:03] they won't speak it correctly
[1:20:04] how can the holy spirit that's even in
[1:20:06] you quicken something that's not true
[1:20:09] all right good amen he's having to sort
[1:20:11] out what is not right and tell you those
[1:20:13] things are not right
[1:20:16] that's why we must have a faithful
[1:20:18] ministry that's not making me a job
[1:20:22] i don't consider preaching a job
[1:20:26] i consider it the greatest opportunity
[1:20:28] to ever be who wasn't years ago was
[1:20:30] gonna
[1:20:31] probably gonna step down from being a
[1:20:32] preacher and run for president now
[1:20:34] that's the biggest shame of anything
[1:20:35] could ever be
[1:20:38] yeah y'all call him i didn't put his
[1:20:40] name back
[1:20:42] but you mean me step down from preaching
[1:20:46] the gospel the greatest position of
[1:20:48] anywhere in the world
[1:20:50] behind a 90 little people in lula
[1:20:53] georgia
[1:20:54] and me step down and run for president
[1:20:58] don't ask me i'd be ashamed
[1:21:02] i'm in the highest position
[1:21:06] in this world
[1:21:09] to stand and try to speak to you about
[1:21:12] what god has given me
[1:21:16] and i don't speak to you unless he gives
[1:21:18] it to me about something
[1:21:19] yeah sure i know the bible is preaching
[1:21:22] sermon yeah that's what people think
[1:21:24] and that's what they think preaching is
[1:21:27] all right so listen a minute
[1:21:30] and i'm not see you admit you
[1:21:32] misunderstand me i'm sorry
[1:21:35] people think preaching is emotionalism
[1:21:37] that i was saying this morning to work
[1:21:38] that they get you involved into the
[1:21:40] message because that's where we would
[1:21:41] brother dick might not remember we was
[1:21:43] up at a
[1:21:43] minister's meeting and that guy got
[1:21:46] people involved and
[1:21:47] brother dick richard punched me and said
[1:21:49] he said he's trained
[1:21:51] he's trying but you know what happened
[1:21:54] at the end of this
[1:21:55] after it's over with he spoke and i
[1:21:57] spoke
[1:21:59] now here was this man i know what he's
[1:22:01] trying to do so don't misunderstand me i
[1:22:03] know he was trying to get in my pocket
[1:22:04] and win me
[1:22:05] so i ain't worried about it because i
[1:22:07] wouldn't get one
[1:22:08] you know but he said
[1:22:13] you got what i went to school to learn
[1:22:17] i said what that's what he said so you
[1:22:20] got what i want school to learn
[1:22:22] right he says you got it from this
[1:22:25] natural he said i'll trade with you any
[1:22:27] day
[1:22:31] i believe the man meant the truth about
[1:22:33] it right of course i know he's trying to
[1:22:34] get me in his pocket with him
[1:22:36] ride his horse with him but i wouldn't
[1:22:37] want to ride that horse because they
[1:22:39] used to ride it out west and bury the
[1:22:40] books like all these others did but
[1:22:42] anyhow uh
[1:22:45] i'm just i'm just me
[1:22:49] but i believe that somebody has to
[1:22:51] expound it to us
[1:22:53] well now brother dale who do you listen
[1:22:54] to i listen to all the five-fold
[1:22:56] ministries i get a chance to
[1:22:59] because i am one person that believes in
[1:23:02] a five-fold ministry
[1:23:04] i've told you before and tell you again
[1:23:07] if i could find a real true prophet that
[1:23:10] i knew and could put the confidence in
[1:23:11] that man as a prophet in the fivefold
[1:23:13] ministry
[1:23:14] not outside of all these other garbage
[1:23:16] cans
[1:23:17] i'd call him in and tell him says start
[1:23:19] with me at the front and go to the back
[1:23:22] and tell every one of us what's wrong
[1:23:23] with us
[1:23:26] that's right but that would be what a
[1:23:28] prophet would be dealing with those
[1:23:30] things
[1:23:30] you see i believe in the five-fold
[1:23:32] ministry
[1:23:34] and i believe it so much that i believe
[1:23:36] that this thing is hinged upon whether
[1:23:38] or not
[1:23:39] you can listen to a fifo ministry and
[1:23:41] believe that god has spoken to you
[1:23:46] but if god could use a dumb donkey to
[1:23:48] speak right
[1:23:50] or a rooster to crow for anointed ones
[1:23:54] to preach a message to you
[1:23:56] why can't we believe in at least the
[1:23:57] anointing
[1:23:59] forget the person know i don't have the
[1:24:02] mannerism the
[1:24:04] the the things you know of of being a
[1:24:06] preacher i i've never tried to be
[1:24:09] that's joyce what kind of clothes i wear
[1:24:10] walmarts
[1:24:13] red green pink and blue with tennis
[1:24:15] shoes and then tore all the pieces you
[1:24:16] know
[1:24:18] because i'm just myself and i just about
[1:24:22] wear that here if you wouldn't for the
[1:24:24] fact that you're just
[1:24:25] not supposed to be that way
[1:24:28] because i love my old blue jeans i ain't
[1:24:30] like brother gary now
[1:24:31] the gary loves them with holes in them
[1:24:32] but
[1:24:34] i like mine to be a little better now
[1:24:36] but now get get what i'm saying
[1:24:39] the five-fold ministry is supposed to be
[1:24:41] for the perfecting of the science right
[1:24:44] now i believe and i'm going to say it so
[1:24:45] just go ahead
[1:24:47] i believe that that has been the one of
[1:24:49] the biggest hindrances
[1:24:51] that this message has ever had is the
[1:24:54] people cannot
[1:24:55] believe in the faithful ministry all
[1:24:58] right now i'm going to be first up try
[1:24:59] to tell you
[1:25:00] that if you're talking about a lot of
[1:25:01] these preachers around the country i
[1:25:03] don't believe in them either
[1:25:05] okay no problem
[1:25:13] but i don't believe in living like the
[1:25:14] devil and having four wives and
[1:25:17] and 19 kids and and all of these garbage
[1:25:21] cans you've got
[1:25:21] that claim to be preachers in this
[1:25:23] mission but you know what they're just
[1:25:24] popular
[1:25:25] you go to these meetings somewhere oh
[1:25:27] there's old brothers i'm going over
[1:25:29] shake bro
[1:25:29] and show his hand and this guy standing
[1:25:31] over there that could help you like
[1:25:32] everything
[1:25:34] him i'd rather be there
[1:25:37] that's what they're saying you know but
[1:25:41] i believe that our problem is we don't
[1:25:43] believe in the ministry
[1:25:47] amen and i told you
[1:25:51] i don't blame you i blame the ministry
[1:25:55] that's what sent us on the internet
[1:25:57] folks it's me going out
[1:25:59] among people and go out and it got
[1:26:01] heartbreaking
[1:26:02] to go and people and you'd see them want
[1:26:04] to come and talk to you
[1:26:06] they want to ask you questions and i
[1:26:08] said listen i can't answer questions
[1:26:10] but just going we we do have the tapes
[1:26:14] and things you know
[1:26:15] i'm not trying to win anybody but just
[1:26:17] if you want to hear what i've said about
[1:26:19] it
[1:26:19] go to the internet or go to the identity
[1:26:22] old taping system
[1:26:24] and you know what a lot of them say i
[1:26:25] can't do it
[1:26:27] my pastor won't let me
[1:26:31] well that just that tore my heart
[1:26:33] because they want to hear the truth but
[1:26:35] your pastor won't let them
[1:26:36] right so i just opened up and said okay
[1:26:39] be what you want to call me what you
[1:26:40] want to it's on the internet you listen
[1:26:42] to it
[1:26:43] and i'm not out you under trying to win
[1:26:45] churches and win people to the message
[1:26:46] and
[1:26:47] i mean you know to this church to come
[1:26:49] here i've never said that
[1:26:52] all right but you see i don't believe
[1:26:54] that we trust the fivefold ministry
[1:26:57] and you know really i don't believe we
[1:27:00] understand
[1:27:01] a five-fold ministry now this is my
[1:27:04] whole point
[1:27:06] i believe that it's going to take the
[1:27:08] fivefold ministry to
[1:27:10] expound upon the scriptures
[1:27:14] see for us to be able to come to the
[1:27:16] place to understand
[1:27:18] brother branham's message because why
[1:27:20] would it
[1:27:21] be the way he said that was what it was
[1:27:23] to be the bible said that was what it
[1:27:25] was to be
[1:27:26] why would it be an argument about it see
[1:27:28] people get
[1:27:29] upset with me for bringing that out and
[1:27:31] then like one brother said one time he
[1:27:33] said
[1:27:34] i think brother dale's a teacher and
[1:27:35] brother just sneered like everybody
[1:27:38] he said what are you i'm a pastor
[1:27:42] he said well that's just one of them you
[1:27:45] know there's five of them
[1:27:47] what's the problem with brother dale
[1:27:48] being a teacher if you're a pastor
[1:27:50] but you know the pastors are in no way
[1:27:52] gonna turn around and turn the money
[1:27:54] back into the tape recorders
[1:27:58] right
[1:28:01] they're going to be pastors with the
[1:28:02] money in the pocket but then they're
[1:28:04] going to be well you can't listen on
[1:28:05] these other stuff you know
[1:28:07] beware be careful you get confused
[1:28:11] in other words beware who would it uh
[1:28:15] uh it was back there one of them might
[1:28:17] have been um
[1:28:18] i forgot hey and one trip said don't go
[1:28:21] down and find out you're already
[1:28:22] confused
[1:28:23] one of the great events said that one
[1:28:25] time because they said don't go down and
[1:28:26] get confused he said don't go down and
[1:28:28] find out you're already confused
[1:28:30] but see i don't believe we can
[1:28:31] understand the five full minutes right
[1:28:35] with all of that said i don't blame
[1:28:37] people see because
[1:28:39] you hear preachers they'll preach
[1:28:40] something then six months later they're
[1:28:42] on something else and
[1:28:44] six months later on something else and
[1:28:46] and then they run off into the world and
[1:28:47] they're out doing all kind of
[1:28:49] you know and it's made a shame and a
[1:28:52] disgrace to be called a preacher
[1:28:54] i don't like that i don't even like to
[1:28:56] be called a preacher call me brother
[1:29:01] why because there's so many garbage can
[1:29:03] preachers
[1:29:05] the poor old laity what can they do
[1:29:07] brother around said he said sheep lead
[1:29:08] out of a garbage can in the house too
[1:29:10] because they've got to live right right
[1:29:14] but the bible says
[1:29:17] jesus to the pharisees you stand in the
[1:29:20] door
[1:29:21] and you won't go in and you won't let
[1:29:24] them go in
[1:29:29] we see we need somebody to open their
[1:29:31] understanding right
[1:29:33] amen and it's not to open us understand
[1:29:36] that we need to fight for ministry
[1:29:37] that's fine right
[1:29:40] right all right that's the book is
[1:29:43] brother dick
[1:29:44] that's it brother brattle said it that's
[1:29:46] it
[1:29:47] it's not that but to open our
[1:29:49] understanding of the things brother
[1:29:51] brown has said
[1:29:52] right that the bible has said right
[1:29:55] see like i gave the illustration the
[1:29:57] other day how many of you would love to
[1:29:59] have a revelation
[1:30:00] that the bible and the prophet said by
[1:30:03] having a new birth
[1:30:04] you're just as righteous as god is
[1:30:07] all right what i'd love for that to be
[1:30:09] revealed to me i'd be running all over
[1:30:11] this place
[1:30:14] wouldn't you i could see it right
[1:30:17] and then i'll lose it right now find it
[1:30:20] right
[1:30:20] right exactly right one day i'm doing
[1:30:23] pretty good the next day involved
[1:30:27] in the hell i feel it like it is i don't
[1:30:29] play around
[1:30:32] but you see he gave some apostles
[1:30:37] now i've explained that to you right he
[1:30:39] gave some prophets some evangelist some
[1:30:41] pastor some teacher
[1:30:43] a lot of people think that he just gave
[1:30:45] something he just looked
[1:30:46] moved down like that i i never have
[1:30:48] believed that i believe he gives you
[1:30:50] what you need
[1:30:51] that's why i said he gave some apostles
[1:30:54] to emphasize
[1:30:55] some people need a teacher some people
[1:30:58] can get bible just a
[1:30:59] a pastor
[1:31:04] but i just never was that way and
[1:31:07] and i just want to hear more you know
[1:31:09] and i'm always
[1:31:11] wanting desire to hear now listen i'm
[1:31:14] trying to get a point to you where he
[1:31:15] says he opened their understanding
[1:31:17] i'm not talking about revelation okay
[1:31:20] okay because i can't reveal anything to
[1:31:22] you right
[1:31:23] brother can't reveal anything to you
[1:31:28] the lord jesus said in my own life did
[1:31:31] not reveal that that's paraphrasing
[1:31:33] what brother brown said it was sitting
[1:31:34] there
[1:31:38] he said only the holy ghost christ the
[1:31:40] mr god revealed the holy ghost is the
[1:31:42] only
[1:31:43] revealer of the world no man can do it
[1:31:47] but if it's not sewn down as i said
[1:31:49] while ago
[1:31:50] if it's not thrown down correctly how
[1:31:52] can the holy ghost quicken it
[1:31:54] that's what's been wrong for 40
[1:31:55] something years and while we're here
[1:32:01] it's because it that even just a little
[1:32:04] thought in your ideas
[1:32:05] as i said a moment ago when i had that
[1:32:07] message and the lord spoke to me i
[1:32:09] thought it was a message and he said
[1:32:11] you make your top variant top you know i
[1:32:12] shredded that thing man i burned it i
[1:32:14] done everything
[1:32:15] i didn't want nobody to know what i had
[1:32:18] written down
[1:32:20] because it was wrong
[1:32:26] and i knew it was wrong again
[1:32:31] but listen we need somebody
[1:32:36] to come on the scene to open our
[1:32:38] understanding
[1:32:40] now when i say this it's been for 40
[1:32:43] almost 40 something years standing
[1:32:45] behind here that you know i've said this
[1:32:47] the first time i read the bible not the
[1:32:50] baptist church
[1:32:50] joined the baptist church 1958
[1:32:55] and i i thought well if i'm going to be
[1:32:58] a christian
[1:33:00] i have been to church all my life up and
[1:33:01] down but if i'm going to be a christian
[1:33:03] i need to know what god said in his word
[1:33:05] so i set out to read the bible of course
[1:33:07] we all got stars for doing them but i
[1:33:09] wouldn't care about stars
[1:33:12] i won't know what he said right when i
[1:33:15] got to malachi 3 and malachi 4 i went to
[1:33:17] my wife and i told her i said
[1:33:19] according to what my understanding of
[1:33:20] the bible is here
[1:33:22] that there's going to be two prophets
[1:33:24] come before the end of the world
[1:33:28] and you know
[1:33:31] i i just read it malachi 3 at
[1:33:33] melchizedek well when brother
[1:33:35] began to talk to me about god sending
[1:33:37] the prophet i said words of that in the
[1:33:38] bible he said malachi 4.
[1:33:41] i said okay explain malachi 3.
[1:33:46] he said john the baptist i said put it
[1:33:48] in the scripture
[1:33:50] he said well here it says it didn't turn
[1:33:52] the hearts of the
[1:33:54] fathers to the children you know where
[1:33:56] it goes there in the
[1:33:57] loop i think it is but i said okay
[1:34:00] but we understood this to be on down
[1:34:02] further in the verse that said
[1:34:04] that he turned the disobedient to the he
[1:34:06] said yep
[1:34:07] and if you did you turn them right back
[1:34:08] where you brought them from yeah
[1:34:11] right if john turned them this way and
[1:34:13] then turn them back you go right back
[1:34:15] where you started
[1:34:17] okay you know that over my understanding
[1:34:20] right the point is i believe the bible
[1:34:26] and by reading it over and over you get
[1:34:28] a
[1:34:29] a better understanding you quote it to
[1:34:31] me a lot because it's true
[1:34:33] that you read the bible one time or you
[1:34:34] read the prophet's message one time
[1:34:36] and you get something and you go back
[1:34:38] and read the same message or the same
[1:34:40] scripture
[1:34:40] and you get more not a different meaning
[1:34:43] right if you get a different meaning
[1:34:44] something
[1:34:45] wrong with one of the two it can't be
[1:34:47] both of them's right
[1:34:48] so you get a better understanding of
[1:34:50] what's happening and that's going into
[1:34:52] your intellectual instrument
[1:34:57] but then every once in a while god drops
[1:34:59] it down
[1:35:01] i said every once in a while because
[1:35:04] that's the way i believe it and that's
[1:35:05] why he does it to me
[1:35:07] you ought to be surprised sometimes i i
[1:35:09] preach for three months on something i
[1:35:10] don't know where in the world i'm going
[1:35:11] from here
[1:35:12] i don't know what i'm going to preach on
[1:35:14] and i'm in that
[1:35:15] stage and we'll take some sermons and i
[1:35:17] know what i'm preaching and know what
[1:35:18] i'm trying to preach that we're
[1:35:20] getting the understanding of the change
[1:35:21] of the body but
[1:35:23] you know but then something will help my
[1:35:25] boy that's wonderful
[1:35:29] but you get in that about three or four
[1:35:31] sermons and all at once
[1:35:33] you see the end of what you're talking
[1:35:34] about you say lord come on
[1:35:37] please please john said lord come
[1:35:40] quickly
[1:35:41] because i'm running out you know
[1:35:44] and i never said no problem about it
[1:35:46] wouldn't bother me to come call wait
[1:35:48] sunday morning and say
[1:35:49] what you're going to preach or ain't
[1:35:50] going to have no services
[1:35:52] and i don't have anything that wouldn't
[1:35:54] bother me no more taking a drink of
[1:35:55] water
[1:35:57] but you know god's been gracious he's
[1:36:00] always helped me
[1:36:01] because right about that times when he
[1:36:02] opens a lot to you right
[1:36:04] all right but you see we he meets us
[1:36:06] along the way
[1:36:08] and reveals the scriptures to us every
[1:36:11] once in a while
[1:36:12] he could we couldn't stand it for him to
[1:36:13] reveal it all at one time it just
[1:36:15] wouldn't work we would be so much
[1:36:17] out of it we would just we wouldn't be
[1:36:18] human see but he gradually opens the
[1:36:21] scriptures by revealing them
[1:36:22] but if we don't keep putting it into the
[1:36:24] field
[1:36:26] that's right that's why i encourage you
[1:36:28] listen to the tapes
[1:36:29] read the prophet's message study
[1:36:35] a workman that needed not be ashamed
[1:36:37] rightly dividing
[1:36:39] how are you going to know whether i'm
[1:36:40] telling you the truth or not
[1:36:43] that's right
[1:36:47] you got to know it by what's made known
[1:36:49] to
[1:36:51] and you the lord jesus gets in and
[1:36:53] sometimes he leaves you kind of where
[1:36:56] he lives and he don't answer you you've
[1:36:58] done that
[1:36:59] you asked him about something he lazy
[1:37:01] don't ask you i remember years ago and
[1:37:02] his certain brother said certain things
[1:37:04] the church i was in
[1:37:05] and i prayed lord and and i fasted
[1:37:08] and i said lord you know i'm gonna fast
[1:37:11] do you speak to me about this because
[1:37:12] it's it's desperate to me you know in my
[1:37:16] life
[1:37:16] and i told you about it and brother was
[1:37:19] reading a book and he said
[1:37:20] brother they'll explain this well i went
[1:37:23] three days faster
[1:37:24] and he said explain this i can't
[1:37:26] understand
[1:37:27] well i took the book and just looked at
[1:37:28] it and there was exactly
[1:37:31] what i had asked the lord about in
[1:37:34] letters laying in front of me
[1:37:36] don't use the bible in the message for
[1:37:38] we see which one
[1:37:39] but i've never you know i've told you
[1:37:43] when i've always had to get something
[1:37:45] from god i took the bible and dropped it
[1:37:51] don't do that dear god that's not your
[1:37:53] calling that's not your ways
[1:37:55] don't do that with god that's something
[1:37:57] between me and god
[1:37:59] that's right but he's never failed i
[1:38:01] mean to the words
[1:38:03] on the page one time
[1:38:06] it didn't work and i said lord
[1:38:11] it's never failed me before now lord
[1:38:14] what's wrong and i thought well
[1:38:18] you know i just i got into it myself
[1:38:19] lord and i'm sorry
[1:38:21] you know i was crying and apologizing
[1:38:24] i'm sorry
[1:38:25] he said go back to the top of the page
[1:38:29] because see when i put my finger there
[1:38:31] my answer would be exactly what i'd read
[1:38:32] the verse scripture
[1:38:33] he said go back to the top of the page
[1:38:36] i didn't listen i kept home he'd come
[1:38:39] again go back to the top of the page i
[1:38:41] just turned and looked back at the top
[1:38:42] of the page
[1:38:43] there was in very words exactly what i'm
[1:38:45] asking
[1:38:48] but see uh don't do that because you're
[1:38:50] not called for that
[1:38:52] it's something god told me that don't
[1:38:55] make me nothing
[1:38:56] and i'm not i don't do that to try to
[1:38:58] get you to believe me
[1:39:00] if if you can't know what i preach
[1:39:05] you don't need a sign
[1:39:09] a sign wouldn't do you any good if you
[1:39:11] can't believe what somebody preaches
[1:39:13] right out of the bible
[1:39:16] that's right that's really i don't talk
[1:39:17] about the things sometimes that god
[1:39:19] shows me
[1:39:20] because i don't want you to build up on
[1:39:22] some something
[1:39:24] i want you to build up on what this
[1:39:25] bible says
[1:39:28] but this bible says god will do these
[1:39:30] things
[1:39:31] amen he will open our understanding of
[1:39:34] the scriptures
[1:39:36] that's right but it may be a while
[1:39:38] before he reveals it to us
[1:39:41] but don't get just disenchanted along
[1:39:43] the way
[1:39:47] ask god for a revelation like i told you
[1:39:50] that brother said what do you mean in
[1:39:51] revelation yeah it is a revelation
[1:39:54] it's not a revelation just to be able to
[1:39:56] read brother around his books
[1:39:57] you're right that's not a revelation
[1:40:01] that's right but israel robertson's got
[1:40:03] it
[1:40:07] you can walk on a revelation you don't
[1:40:09] have to worry about that that's right
[1:40:12] if somebody could come along right now
[1:40:13] and take away from you and you believe
[1:40:15] in one god and they deprogram you and
[1:40:17] convince you a trinity
[1:40:18] you know god in three persons blessed
[1:40:20] are a river jordan
[1:40:23] doctrine that you're trying to do in the
[1:40:25] message to say that jesus wasn't god for
[1:40:27] the river jordan
[1:40:28] and they'd be programming the people
[1:40:32] you say brother dale you know see we
[1:40:34] should call names but we don't
[1:40:39] because a lot of you listen to them
[1:40:43] that are teaching that just be careful
[1:40:48] because you it's going to catch you or
[1:40:51] you're going to learn it's wrong
[1:40:52] right that's right it's going to catch
[1:40:55] you
[1:40:56] and then i'm going to have to say
[1:40:57] something
[1:41:00] i don't like that i i want to
[1:41:04] be a brother in christ is trying to help
[1:41:07] you see the message
[1:41:10] and to believe that we need to believe
[1:41:12] the message we need to believe the
[1:41:14] prophets made we need to believe about
[1:41:15] we need to believe the faithful minutes
[1:41:17] but we need to believe each other
[1:41:19] right brother branham was so gracious a
[1:41:21] person
[1:41:23] a man was telling him about a dream that
[1:41:25] he had to remember and
[1:41:26] and it was about his wife was supposed
[1:41:28] to be this that or the others he'd
[1:41:30] forgive her that
[1:41:31] he said i wanted to believe that god
[1:41:33] told him that
[1:41:38] but he said he did
[1:41:42] he said cause it's contrary to the word
[1:41:45] he said you women preachers i'm not
[1:41:47] going to tell
[1:41:48] you that god didn't call you to pray
[1:41:52] you know why because the anointing
[1:41:53] didn't call them to preach
[1:41:57] on their spirit right right
[1:42:04] but he said i'm going to tell you it's
[1:42:05] not according to the bible
[1:42:10] all right forget what i'm saying another
[1:42:12] minute or two
[1:42:21] a preacher actually
[1:42:26] he needs to study he needs to prepare he
[1:42:29] needs to say
[1:42:30] things in a way but yet you don't have
[1:42:32] to
[1:42:33] now i write my sermons i i do i write
[1:42:35] mine a lot of preachers don't write them
[1:42:37] i write my sermons all right
[1:42:38] notes and you see the see the blue and
[1:42:41] the yellow that blue
[1:42:42] means it's found upon the yellow means
[1:42:44] pick it up say something about it
[1:42:45] the white says if you got time
[1:42:48] okay
[1:42:52] but you see
[1:42:55] the preacher needs to go before the lord
[1:42:57] and do as we said this morning he needs
[1:42:59] the inside teacher himself
[1:43:02] all right and then he needs to go before
[1:43:04] god and get a message and bring it to
[1:43:06] the people
[1:43:09] and then god will use him in the correct
[1:43:11] way
[1:43:12] because he'll expound upon the
[1:43:14] scriptures
[1:43:19] and as he does then the holy spirit can
[1:43:21] speak to you that's right
[1:43:22] right because right around said a
[1:43:23] preacher is nothing in the world he said
[1:43:25] his gift is to just
[1:43:27] to be able to break satan's spell over
[1:43:30] your eyes
[1:43:32] right where god can speak straight to
[1:43:34] you
[1:43:35] now how do you break a spell over people
[1:43:37] die hocus pocus jiminy occurs we're
[1:43:39] gonna catch some dust out we're gonna
[1:43:41] clear your mind no
[1:43:45] the only way i know to get anybody's
[1:43:46] mind in the right order is preach the
[1:43:48] gospel
[1:43:50] because according to my bible now listen
[1:43:53] my bible says that the gospel
[1:43:56] is the power of god
[1:43:59] unto salvation
[1:44:06] see because you can't have salvation
[1:44:07] without hearing the gospel
[1:44:10] show me one time they received any holy
[1:44:11] ghost in the bible without hearing the
[1:44:12] message first
[1:44:13] right impossible right
[1:44:20] but god is breaking it down to us in the
[1:44:23] end time
[1:44:25] to try to get us to believe the message
[1:44:28] that has been brought into us
[1:44:30] i believe everything the prophet said
[1:44:31] people swear by that it's all right i
[1:44:34] know what you're talking about
[1:44:36] i've made them too but
[1:44:41] is it revelation oh he's right that's it
[1:44:46] now revelation will heal you
[1:44:50] intellect will try to convince you not
[1:44:54] to go to the doctor
[1:44:56] because you need faith intellect will
[1:44:59] take you to the doctor because you
[1:45:01] realize you don't have it
[1:45:04] but revelation will heal you
[1:45:07] he'll deliver you
[1:45:11] and anybody's ever been healed knows
[1:45:12] what i'm talking about see some people's
[1:45:14] never had an instant healing or style of
[1:45:16] healing
[1:45:16] you know enough to worry that they can
[1:45:18] just put it on that basis and say that
[1:45:19] was it
[1:45:21] but you see it's not my job to find some
[1:45:24] trick
[1:45:25] rabbit hat something to be able to uh
[1:45:28] cast some dust or something over you to
[1:45:30] open your eyes it's my job to preach the
[1:45:32] gospel
[1:45:33] right because did you notice the
[1:45:35] scripture now said
[1:45:38] the gospel the good news
[1:45:42] now listen what i'm saying please it
[1:45:45] doesn't say the quickened word
[1:45:48] right there it says the gospel is the
[1:45:51] power
[1:45:52] of god unto
[1:45:55] the quickened word okay
[1:45:59] the gospel is the power of god unto
[1:46:01] salvation
[1:46:04] that's why i'm so careful the way that i
[1:46:06] try to preach and i don't mean the
[1:46:07] mannerism in style i'm sorry about that
[1:46:09] i'm sorry but that goes with me just
[1:46:12] forgive me and forget it
[1:46:15] i see you sleepy i see you do everything
[1:46:17] i try to do everything i can to break
[1:46:19] you away from that i see you following
[1:46:20] this time and i try to do that i try to
[1:46:22] make a funny face to get you to believe
[1:46:24] or whatever
[1:46:26] you know that's just part of me
[1:46:30] but what does the gospel say
[1:46:36] that's where i've always asked one
[1:46:38] question anybody leisure to show me
[1:46:40] where i'm off the word
[1:46:41] where are you going whatever is your
[1:46:43] business but please come show me
[1:46:45] where i'm off the word if i am because i
[1:46:48] want to be right
[1:46:52] sure i'm stubborn mule-headed and
[1:46:54] everything in the world yes sir
[1:46:56] because you are too
[1:47:00] too stubborn stubborn
[1:47:04] because you got your idea you're trying
[1:47:05] to convince me or you wouldn't be trying
[1:47:07] to tell me it's off
[1:47:09] right but you see this thing is not made
[1:47:12] to just play around with this
[1:47:14] this is a gospel to believe
[1:47:18] this message was to be made where we
[1:47:20] could live it
[1:47:22] and living the message see once now i'm
[1:47:25] going to make a life statement of what
[1:47:26] i'm doing
[1:47:27] now if we believe in progressive
[1:47:29] understanding
[1:47:31] all right progressive revelation upon
[1:47:34] the understanding
[1:47:36] would not have come to a place one day
[1:47:40] to where the bible would be correct
[1:47:43] and we know the bible is correct but i'm
[1:47:44] just making a point the bible says
[1:47:46] there'll come a time
[1:47:48] when the uh what if the sword will catch
[1:47:52] up with the reaper which way is that
[1:47:54] somebody quote it to me i just happen to
[1:47:56] think of that scripture but
[1:47:58] there's a there's a place there that the
[1:47:59] sower and the reaper
[1:48:01] are going to be together
[1:48:05] now how is that in the world it can't be
[1:48:07] you can't slow
[1:48:08] and then reach back down and get your
[1:48:09] corn out of the grain
[1:48:11] that's but in the bible there's to be a
[1:48:15] place come
[1:48:17] that the sower and the reaper will be
[1:48:19] running together
[1:48:21] because that's former and latter rain
[1:48:24] all right see because what you've heard
[1:48:27] today
[1:48:29] if god quickens it to you if you only
[1:48:32] get it in your understanding it's former
[1:48:34] rain
[1:48:35] if it's quick on this ladder right right
[1:48:38] but you know what tomorrow
[1:48:40] what you have today is only form of rain
[1:48:48] why because every day there's a word
[1:48:51] is that true give me this day in my
[1:48:53] daily bread
[1:48:55] that's why the prophet would preach so
[1:48:57] much on former latter reign then he
[1:48:59] preached on dynamics and mechanics
[1:49:02] mechanics is a refilling of the holy
[1:49:04] ghost
[1:49:06] i gave it to you there this morning we
[1:49:07] didn't read it it was a refilling of the
[1:49:09] holy ghost
[1:49:11] i'm expecting that i'm expecting another
[1:49:15] day of pentecost
[1:49:18] we're not that we're gathered in up a
[1:49:20] room but we're gathered around the world
[1:49:22] to the word of god
[1:49:24] and a snoring will strike home that will
[1:49:27] just fill every fiber of our being
[1:49:29] and we'll go out of here
[1:49:33] but to do that we've got to hear what
[1:49:36] faith cometh by your ear
[1:49:41] and hearing by the word see if we don't
[1:49:43] hear the word we can't have faith
[1:49:46] all right so then let's just keep piling
[1:49:48] the word in
[1:49:52] all right amen if we're around here 20
[1:49:54] more years would you still be saying
[1:49:55] something but
[1:49:56] because i said this 40 years ago
[1:49:59] keep piling the word again ask brother
[1:50:01] ray of some of these statements
[1:50:03] that i made 20 years ago or 30 because
[1:50:05] he's taking it off and putting it on
[1:50:09] the dvds for your cds and things for you
[1:50:12] you know
[1:50:13] all right but you see i believe
[1:50:16] that they'll come a place now you'll
[1:50:19] have to take and i'd have to take blood
[1:50:21] mode for it anyway because
[1:50:22] i never i've looked it up to try to find
[1:50:24] the point of it made but
[1:50:25] it made the point to start but there's a
[1:50:27] place in
[1:50:28] in um revelation that it's called
[1:50:31] linguistics
[1:50:33] now linguistics doesn't mean language
[1:50:36] that's what you're thinking
[1:50:37] automatically linguistics means language
[1:50:39] no
[1:50:40] no linguistics means that you have
[1:50:42] reached a place where nothing else can
[1:50:44] be said
[1:50:52] i believe that that's why i'm not
[1:50:54] looking for another prophet to come
[1:50:56] because if i did he'd have something
[1:50:57] else to say
[1:51:00] i believe god brought us the message
[1:51:04] i'm looking for a people to come in that
[1:51:06] message to the place
[1:51:08] right amen and i'll go ahead and say it
[1:51:10] to you because it's what i believe
[1:51:12] not a new thing because you've heard it
[1:51:15] i believe we have enough faith right now
[1:51:16] to raise
[1:51:17] all of the dead down through time i
[1:51:20] believe the revelation is here
[1:51:21] to be able to raise up all of those down
[1:51:23] through time
[1:51:25] but if around the world and i said
[1:51:28] around the world i didn't say in one
[1:51:29] individual so don't misunderstand that
[1:51:32] statement
[1:51:33] around the world the prophet's message
[1:51:35] is going to be in the bride of christ
[1:51:38] until it will be exactly the way he
[1:51:40] brought it
[1:51:42] and nothing else can be added you talk
[1:51:46] about an
[1:51:46] august presence
[1:51:51] then god will come on the scene
[1:52:00] i hope i got my point across
[1:52:04] you can have an understanding open and
[1:52:07] it not be a revelation
[1:52:11] but you can have a revelation but you'll
[1:52:14] never have it
[1:52:15] until your understanding is first open
[1:52:18] so if i'm not preaching the truth
[1:52:24] you have my permission to go wherever
[1:52:27] you desire
[1:52:29] but if they're preaching something more
[1:52:31] than i do this please let me
[1:52:33] have the opportunity to hear
[1:52:36] you know because i want change
[1:52:41] we fought around horrible enough folks
[1:52:43] that's right it's time to go into the
[1:52:44] promised land
[1:52:47] we've heard these stories for a long
[1:52:48] time
[1:52:50] but it's time for it to be revealed what
[1:52:52] do you think about it
[1:52:54] have you had your understanding opened
[1:52:57] to the scriptures
[1:53:00] but just don't call that the holy ghost
[1:53:02] now it
[1:53:03] see back up to the morning message if it
[1:53:06] wasn't for the preacher preaching it it
[1:53:07] wouldn't
[1:53:08] so it is an anointing it is the holy
[1:53:10] ghost that opens your understanding
[1:53:14] that's the point i've been trying to
[1:53:15] make the holy ghost opens your
[1:53:17] understanding
[1:53:18] but it doesn't mean he reveals it
[1:53:20] because there's more to be brought
[1:53:23] so he can open our understanding of the
[1:53:25] scriptures and we can see things
[1:53:27] but don't quit
[1:53:32] the prophet of god standing there on
[1:53:34] those seals and i remember went through
[1:53:35] it
[1:53:36] for years and all and preaching and
[1:53:38] studying on it and
[1:53:39] everything with that our general motors
[1:53:41] running a job that
[1:53:42] it took two people to run the day i was
[1:53:44] out and everything
[1:53:46] and so fast and i was standing there
[1:53:48] working and doing and the lord was
[1:53:50] dealing with me about the opening of the
[1:53:52] seals and
[1:53:53] i was working with a 4000 heater
[1:53:56] and uh you know and there
[1:54:00] all at once he just dropped something
[1:54:01] down into my heart
[1:54:05] and he said did not the prophet saying
[1:54:08] here stands a lamb with a book in his
[1:54:10] hand and now fire goes the white horse
[1:54:12] rider
[1:54:14] said then if you see two people in the
[1:54:15] bible one of them's got to be the
[1:54:17] antichrist because there ain't no two
[1:54:18] gods
[1:54:20] that quickened that seal right there
[1:54:22] into my heart
[1:54:26] i knew then and i didn't have no
[1:54:27] problems
[1:54:29] so when i got home i looked to see
[1:54:33] and that's exactly what the prophet said
[1:54:35] about 158 of the seal book
[1:54:40] but he was speaking from my memory
[1:54:44] of what i had read that's right
[1:54:48] and telling me you think i'm worried
[1:54:50] about anybody turn that down
[1:54:52] no
[1:54:55] because i know it's true
[1:54:59] i love the lord don't choose the boy
[1:55:01] here let's try number 275
[1:55:09] i was sure
[1:55:30] of
[1:55:44] my
[1:55:58] me
[1:56:12] me
[1:56:36] i give you a present you said look at it
[1:56:39] i can tell you all that's in the box
[1:57:02] i want to see
[1:57:06] let me get inside the box i want to see
[1:57:08] what's in there
[1:57:10] i just want to add in the gospel
[1:57:14] i spent my life trying to help you
[1:57:19] to see what the prophet has said
[1:57:36] depart
[1:57:42] i had a quote on that this morning and
[1:57:43] you'll look at one of those on the
[1:57:45] anointed one

[1:57:50] ones and how they

[1:58:03] to argue

[1:58:47] he said the call to preach
[1:58:50] wherever i'm called to preach this
[1:58:52] mystery he said
[1:58:57] the message paul was to preach with his
[1:58:59] call to break
[1:59:10] and all that it's a message that brother
[1:59:13] adam has brought to us let's break it

[2:04:07] not to try to interpret it to some way
[2:04:10] or make our own thoughts
[2:04:11] but to just say what he said but to say
[2:04:14] it in a way
