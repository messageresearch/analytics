[0:16] glory so pour out your power
[0:20] in love as we sing
[0:24] holy holy holy
[0:35] [Music]
[0:42] holy
[0:44] [Music]
[0:50] amen god bless you this morning good to
[0:52] see you
[0:53] now we've come not to see each other we
[0:55] come to see him
[0:56] worship him in spirit and in truth so
[0:58] god bless you
[0:59] good to be in the house of the lord
[1:01] today remember those that are not here
[1:03] the ones that are sick
[1:05] and we were looking up this quote and it
[1:10] took
[1:12] there was 95 quotes i was looking up to
[1:14] find one and
[1:15] it was the 93rd quote
[1:20] so the lord gives you patience
[1:24] but i want to read this to you i knew
[1:26] brother adam has said this so i put in
[1:28] some
[1:29] you know how you'll put in a string of
[1:31] words but you can't get them all
[1:32] together because they're not exactly the
[1:34] way
[1:35] sometimes we quote it so i put in
[1:39] you can win done all you
[1:42] stand stand do oh
[1:46] okay and now i finally got it shalom
[1:47] 1964. listen to this some people
[1:50] say but brother branham i've tried and
[1:51] i've tried
[1:53] but wait a minute patience is a virtue
[1:57] patience is holy spirit virtue they that
[2:00] wait upon the lord shall renew their
[2:02] strength
[2:03] you say how can i wait any longer just
[2:05] keep on waiting
[2:07] when you've done all you can do to stand
[2:11] then stand see just stand how am i going
[2:14] to do it
[2:15] stand that's all i said stand
[2:17] exclamation point
[2:19] he said it's the truth and it's the
[2:21] truth he said it'll happen
[2:23] how i don't know but it will happen
[2:28] he said so he promised it if he promised
[2:31] it
[2:31] it's going to happen so now remember god
[2:34] took
[2:34] thousands of years to fulfill his
[2:36] promise of a coming savior
[2:39] four thousand years god took to fulfill
[2:41] that promise but he knowed from the
[2:43] beginning just when it was going to
[2:44] happen
[2:45] no one else knew but he knew and when it
[2:47] happened the people was such a delusion
[2:49] until they didn't know
[2:50] how to accept it the same thing if the
[2:53] same thing hasn't repeated today
[2:55] it always does never fails both sides so
[2:59] when you've all done all you can do
[3:01] stand all right where we're gonna go
[3:04] it's like kind of like job you know you
[3:06] where are you gonna go i didn't know and
[3:10] peter you know
[3:11] jesus just called him a devil and
[3:14] peter said well lord you can call me
[3:16] whatever you want to but
[3:18] where else am i going to go in other
[3:21] words what he was saying is there is the
[3:22] devil and there's you
[3:23] which way i'm not going that way i'm
[3:26] going
[3:27] toward you so we just we just
[3:30] need to have patience and stand
[3:33] also brother brown the greatest battle
[3:35] ever fought in 1962 he said when you've
[3:37] done all you can do to stand
[3:39] then stand because the bible tells us
[3:43] that what having done all stand
[3:47] amen so we just stand for the word of
[3:49] god
[3:52] god will do what he said he'll do amen

[5:57] somebody else come
[5:58] so um god bless you we love you with the
[6:00] love of the lord
[6:02] let's turn our bibles to leviticus 23.
[6:05] we're going to
[6:08] be speaking today on the feast of
[6:09] tabernacles
[6:11] like i said before remember everyone oh
[6:13] also remember brother ron spencer he's
[6:15] going
[6:16] one day this week to they're gonna run
[6:19] the scan
[6:20] again on his brain and his and his lungs
[6:24] um for the uh
[6:27] supposed cancer so we're not we're gonna
[6:30] believe that all is well and
[6:32] everything's done good
[6:34] um brother nate and sister caitlin had a
[6:36] beautiful baby
[6:37] boy charlie the other day and it's had a
[6:39] few complications but
[6:41] uh according to what they're saying now
[6:45] the baby may go home in a couple of days
[6:47] so we thank god for that amen
[6:49] well kids are resilient man they're just
[6:51] so resilient you
[6:53] you look at them and you go man that
[6:55] that don't look good
[6:56] then a couple days later the kid's okay
[6:58] you know
[6:59] so he had a lot of bruising and
[7:02] and things uh going on sugar level was
[7:05] up so
[7:07] all of you that know i know you've been
[7:08] in prayer brother nate's a good friend
[7:10] of ours
[7:12] and a good minister in the gospel and
[7:14] been a friend since he was a kid
[7:15] so uh now he has kid so it makes you
[7:18] feel kind of old
[7:19] so anyway we're on the feast of the lord
[7:22] this would be part nine feast of
[7:23] tabernacles
[7:25] all right and this will be the last
[7:27] great feast
[7:29] um that we will be talking about and
[7:32] then what we'll do
[7:33] on wednesday is we'll do a little more
[7:35] review but we will also get into the
[7:39] there was three required feasts that all
[7:41] males
[7:43] m-a-l-e-s all males had to attend there
[7:46] was three feasts
[7:47] they didn't have to attend all seven but
[7:49] there was three that they were required
[7:51] as
[7:51] jews to participate in
[7:54] all right and we'll do those wednesday
[7:56] because to me it shows
[7:58] us in this day and it narrows everything
[8:00] down
[8:02] to those three feasts which they have a
[8:04] significance
[8:05] that's why god asked that that happened
[8:09] all right that they come to the feast
[8:11] and not come empty-handed
[8:13] they had to come with something all
[8:15] right so let's um
[8:17] leviticus 23 34. we'll read here in just
[8:20] a second
[8:21] let's bow our heads to heavenly father
[8:23] thank you for this day that you give us
[8:27] we thank you for the message of the hour
[8:28] lord we thank you for the
[8:30] reality of a living god that we can know
[8:33] that
[8:35] lord the world is looking for you to
[8:38] come and lord you will in a physical
[8:40] form
[8:42] but lord we're looking at that secret
[8:44] catching away
[8:46] we're looking at that thief in the night
[8:48] the one that comes and takes away
[8:50] his lovely bride right out from under
[8:53] the devil's nose
[8:55] and takes us lord over into another
[8:57] dimension just
[8:58] looking a few minutes ago of the
[9:00] pictures of brother moat and brother
[9:02] tatum
[9:03] and brother george canada and brother
[9:05] mike canada lord and just realizing one
[9:07] thing's for sure
[9:08] they're having a lot better time than we
[9:10] are and lord they are waiting to come
[9:13] back here father
[9:14] so that we can reunite with them lord
[9:16] and then our bodies will be changed
[9:18] these tabernacles
[9:20] that you've allowed us to live in lord
[9:22] through our time here on earth
[9:24] lord they're temporary
[9:28] lord but we know that what's inside is
[9:30] eternal
[9:31] and then the outside is going to be
[9:33] changed into the eternal
[9:36] and lord if we don't see you lord we've
[9:39] missed the whole
[9:41] we've missed everything lord if our eyes
[9:44] are not focused on you
[9:45] the the wonderful bridegroom lord
[9:49] lord we long for that day when we can
[9:52] stand there and talk to you lord
[9:54] face to face and lord we know as you
[9:57] said through your prophet that lord you
[10:00] waited for four thousand years before
[10:02] you could come
[10:02] as a little baby but that didn't bother
[10:05] you one bit
[10:07] lord you have patience like no other
[10:09] father
[10:10] i pray that you'll transfer that
[10:12] patience to us lord that we'll realize
[10:14] that you're in total control of this
[10:16] thing and satan has nothing but
[10:18] permitted
[10:19] power his only power he don't even have
[10:22] a power in a name
[10:24] but we have a power in the name of jesus
[10:27] christ
[10:28] the eternal son of the living god
[10:32] the eternal creator the god of the
[10:35] universe
[10:37] but lord you're also residing in our
[10:39] heart today
[10:40] this small tabernacle that we've been
[10:44] given from
[10:45] our birth of union between mom and dad
[10:49] we've all come that way father but lord
[10:51] we've
[10:52] grown up now to a place that that one
[10:55] inside of us lord must
[10:57] begin to take over and it only comes by
[11:01] the revealing of your word as brother
[11:03] bob was talking about wednesday night
[11:04] lord
[11:05] there's no other sensation lord we love
[11:08] those and we love the
[11:09] the different things and the little
[11:12] added bonuses we get but lord there's
[11:15] nothing like you revealing yourself
[11:19] through this word of god and and be
[11:21] sitting in a congregation and
[11:23] the word goes forth and something sparks
[11:25] in your heart and says that ain't
[11:26] nothing but the truth
[11:28] lord we know that those words were
[11:30] spoken many years ago by a little woman
[11:33] lord that
[11:34] just had childlike faith sister hattie
[11:37] wright
[11:37] when those words rang out lord there was
[11:41] something changed
[11:42] and father we pray today lord that that
[11:44] same one would come lord
[11:47] and change father not only change our
[11:50] body but change right now our thinking
[11:52] lord towards you for
[11:54] lord we pray that that then as we
[11:57] pray that that will be changed lord that
[12:01] it'll connect to the outside man
[12:04] and these old vile bodies will be
[12:06] changed lord we know that healing is
[12:08] temporary
[12:09] but lord the healing of the soul is
[12:12] eternal
[12:13] father as we go through this feast of
[12:15] tabernacles let us realize one thing's
[12:17] for sure
[12:19] we're going to live with you for an
[12:21] eternity
[12:22] in these tabernacles but lord there's a
[12:25] process in the journey that we have to
[12:26] go through
[12:27] first and we're going to continue
[12:28] through that today lord be with each one
[12:30] be the ones that are sick
[12:32] be with mom and dad lord keep them safe
[12:35] brother ron spencer lord the
[12:37] the list his brother taran said is so
[12:38] long lord of the people that
[12:40] that have been afflicted by this virus
[12:42] lord but
[12:43] you knew before the foundation of the
[12:45] world i was thinking yesterday lord
[12:48] you're the only one that has a bomb
[12:51] you're the bomb and gilead it's not a
[12:53] chemical
[12:55] it's not a uh it's not something that
[12:57] man can produce
[12:59] but it's lord is something what you are
[13:02] and we look toward that bombing gilead
[13:04] today father
[13:06] that that bomb will be placed on
[13:08] whatever sickness it doesn't matter
[13:10] lord you even told a little prophet that
[13:12] was born in sin and came on the earth
[13:14] and
[13:15] you anointed him to be a prophet in the
[13:16] end time you told him that cancer would
[13:19] not even stand before him
[13:21] lord while he was under that anointing
[13:23] lord we pray that anointing did not
[13:25] leave
[13:26] that anointing is here today and lord is
[13:29] an
[13:30] anointing that comes from us hearing
[13:32] listening
[13:33] and receiving the word of god so i pray
[13:36] that you would bless that time that we
[13:38] have now just for a moment
[13:40] and you'll be with us in jesus name amen

[15:07] 49
[15:08] weeks we've had 49 years we've had all
[15:11] these different 49s

[15:43] a burnt offering and a meat offering a
[15:45] sacrifice a drink offering
[15:47] everything upon this day so in other
[15:49] words we are including
[15:51] everything now all right we've come down
[15:55] to the seventh church age we've come
[15:57] down to the seven seals we've come down
[15:59] to
[15:59] all the sevens that you want to talk
[16:00] about it's right here
[16:03] all right but now remember you and i you
[16:05] got to move over into an eighth day
[16:07] because eighth day is eternity
[16:09] all right come out of the feast but
[16:11] watch what we're doing here
[16:13] now look beside the sabbath of the lord
[16:17] and beside your gifts and besides all
[16:19] your vows and besides all your free
[16:21] will offerings which ye given to the
[16:24] lord this is a special time now watch
[16:26] verse 39
[16:27] also in in the 15th day
[16:30] when you have gathered in the fruit
[16:34] now we're going to talk about in a
[16:35] minute we had one harvest of barley
[16:39] remember one harvest of wheat
[16:42] now we have a this is a harvest of corn
[16:45] and fruit
[16:47] just three harvests all right harvest
[16:50] the barley
[16:51] which was what feast of first fruits
[16:54] feast of pentecost was the two loaves of
[16:57] wheat
[16:58] and this is we're going to talk about
[16:59] today is corn and fruit because what it
[17:02] says right here when you have gathered
[17:04] in the fruit of the land
[17:06] you shall keep a feast unto the lord's
[17:08] seven days
[17:10] on the first day shall be a sabbath and
[17:12] on the eighth day
[17:13] shall be a sabbath and you shall take
[17:16] you on the first day the bowels of
[17:17] goodly trees and branches of palm trees
[17:20] and the bowels of fig trees now this is
[17:23] all white
[17:23] natural things not man-made
[17:27] natural things things that god has
[17:29] produced
[17:30] or the earth has produced all right and
[17:33] you shall rejoice before the lord your
[17:35] god seven days
[17:37] so you have to go outside in your yard
[17:38] and build your build a booth but
[17:40] symbolic
[17:41] all right and you shall take and ye
[17:43] shall take you on the first day the
[17:45] boughs of goodly trees branches of palm
[17:47] trees boughs of thick trees
[17:49] willows of the brook and you shall
[17:50] rejoice and that's going to be a happy
[17:52] time
[17:55] i'm glad god put me in flesh because
[17:58] that's what he requires
[18:00] for redemption
[18:03] he required adam and eve to be in flesh
[18:07] and allowed them to fall so that he can
[18:10] be the redeemer
[18:12] because if you're born again today your
[18:13] soul doesn't need redemption
[18:16] you're you're already redeemed this is
[18:18] what needs redemption
[18:20] so he's telling them to go outside of
[18:23] their normal
[18:25] go build a booth lord we used to love to
[18:28] do it as kids
[18:29] me and terrence and some of the
[18:30] neighbors man we go build we
[18:32] it and there's no wonder we didn't get
[18:34] bit by something
[18:36] but we didn't and it was fun we had fun
[18:38] but look this thing
[18:39] they're going to have a you shall
[18:40] rejoice before the lord your god seven
[18:43] days and you shall keep it a feast unto
[18:45] the lord
[18:46] seven days in the year it shall be a
[18:48] statute forever in your generations
[18:51] you shall celebrate it in the seventh
[18:53] month you shall dwell
[18:54] in booths not just build it you've got
[18:56] to go dwell in it all right
[18:58] you shall dwell in booths seven days all
[19:01] that are israelites born shall dwell in
[19:03] boost
[19:05] that your generation may know that i
[19:08] made the children of israel to dwell in
[19:10] boots when i brought them out of the
[19:11] land of egypt i am the lord your god
[19:13] you may be seated in the lord's blessing
[19:14] because what happened during the 40
[19:16] years
[19:17] we always think man 40 years the the the
[19:20] clothes never
[19:21] um you know they never got uh
[19:24] thread-bearing
[19:25] they never had to shod the shoes they
[19:27] didn't need walmart or k-mart or where
[19:29] they didn't need anything
[19:30] but you got to remember they lived in
[19:32] those tents for 40 years also
[19:35] so god preserved the tents for 40 years
[19:38] that they were living in because you
[19:39] we remember brother gary you've got a
[19:41] that big old uh
[19:42] ten of yours yeah i don't think it lasts
[19:45] 40 years if you
[19:46] but now remember they took it down and
[19:48] put it up every other day or two or
[19:50] every other week or every other month or
[19:51] even every other day
[19:53] they'd have to take that thing down pack
[19:54] it up put it on their animal and go to
[19:56] wherever god tells them to go to
[19:59] so that's the same thing see this thing
[20:00] right here
[20:02] this is your flesh satan beats on it
[20:05] because
[20:06] he has one hold on you and that's your
[20:08] flesh
[20:10] he has he knows that that thing came
[20:12] from sin
[20:14] it came from uh the cause that he caused
[20:18] in the garden
[20:19] all right that eve caused but satan was
[20:21] a part of it
[20:23] and he knows that he can have a part of
[20:26] that attachment to your flesh
[20:28] as we were talking to also if you pull
[20:30] the chart up
[20:32] when we talk about the two lows this is
[20:34] leaven
[20:35] we know leaven is sin but this is born
[20:37] in sin
[20:38] shape and iniquity this is not any good
[20:41] this is decaying it is rotting i'll
[20:43] promise you
[20:44] don't wear deodorant for a while
[20:47] don't ever try that not in a crowd
[20:51] maybe with social distancing but not in
[20:53] a crowd
[20:55] all right why because we're corrupt
[21:00] we are corrupt people in this
[21:03] so what does god have to do god has to
[21:06] clean the inside guy up first
[21:08] our problem is it's like bob was talking
[21:09] about wednesday
[21:11] you know you can do's and don't sit
[21:12] things to death
[21:15] this thing but if there's no re if the
[21:18] if the resident in the house is still
[21:21] the resident that made you do it before
[21:24] eventually you're going to just keep
[21:25] doing it you're going to hide you're
[21:27] going to try to
[21:28] you know you're going to try to hide it
[21:29] or or something but
[21:31] but when the holy ghost comes into your
[21:33] soul and cleans that thing out
[21:36] takes that desire that you had for doing
[21:38] those things away
[21:40] see then our body
[21:44] you know what think about this we live
[21:47] in this world
[21:48] we work we rub shoulders with humanity
[21:53] amen all the time
[21:57] we buy cars we buy houses we interact
[21:59] with let's think about this the other
[22:00] day we interact with the world
[22:05] we all do even maybe internationally
[22:10] with brother john doing the different
[22:12] things he does and all the different
[22:13] things that uh well y'all doing car lot
[22:15] you you interact all the time
[22:18] and when they look at you
[22:21] they look at you as well you're you know
[22:23] you're just a nice guy a nice looking
[22:26] guy you know you
[22:27] you dress well um but then you got to go
[22:30] deeper than that you see there's no
[22:32] earrings in our ear men
[22:34] no earrings in the women's ear then you
[22:36] keep going deeper and i know some of you
[22:38] may have got a tattoo before you came
[22:40] into the message and i'm not
[22:41] bashing tattoos but
[22:45] you're not all tatted up so they look at
[22:48] you a little different that way and then
[22:50] then you
[22:51] you continue through through your
[22:53] conversation
[22:54] with people listen if they don't walk
[22:56] away
[22:59] if they don't walk away and say there's
[23:01] something different about that person
[23:06] and sometimes they'll ask you
[23:09] you know like i got friends i tell them
[23:12] don't call me on sunday
[23:15] why we go to church too i say yeah y'all
[23:18] go like 30 minutes in the morning and
[23:19] you're back home by lunch so you watch
[23:21] football
[23:23] not now but but was able to before you
[23:26] understand what i'm saying
[23:27] and then we tell people we go to church
[23:29] and we're there pretty much all day
[23:31] and they look at you like huh
[23:35] a preacher preach an hour oh come on
[23:38] people good
[23:39] we got to show the world that we're
[23:42] different
[23:42] we can stand here and preach we can but
[23:46] look
[23:46] once we do come to the level that we
[23:49] have the baptism of the holy ghost
[23:51] and we come to church and we what we
[23:53] commune with god
[23:55] in the way that he wants us to commune
[23:57] with him
[23:58] not like the world that communes with
[24:00] him when they really are not communion
[24:02] with him you know who they're communing
[24:04] with
[24:05] the god of this evil age has inserted
[24:07] itself to be jesus christ
[24:10] i said he's inserted himself to be
[24:13] and then everything's okay but
[24:16] everything's not okay we have a level
[24:18] that we have to come to
[24:20] that no amount of sermon no amount of
[24:22] preaching
[24:23] is going to change somebody
[24:27] but your life will
[24:31] you could not say a word
[24:34] brother brown what'd he say he said live
[24:37] me a sermon
[24:40] so no matter of do's and don'ts and do
[24:42] all these different things bro that we
[24:43] did it forever
[24:44] and you just sat there and went on and
[24:45] did what you wanted to do didn't you
[24:48] right you still do what you want to do
[24:50] now right
[24:51] see it's a change but it just changed
[24:53] the way you look at it
[24:55] all right same way with all of us you
[24:57] know you i've always said you know you
[24:58] take this
[24:59] you take this tabernacle
[25:02] god didn't destroy it he cleaned it up
[25:07] this used to hold a bear this used to
[25:09] curse
[25:10] xyz put whatever you got in there amen
[25:13] god didn't cut the hand off and
[25:16] no he changed the what the guy in the
[25:18] control tower
[25:20] he changed it where i then listened to
[25:23] the correct watchman
[25:25] getting off my subject here but that
[25:27] part of it though
[25:28] part of it because you and i are now in
[25:33] the feast of tabernacles so what
[25:34] anything goes on has to go on
[25:36] it goes on in your tabernacle not this
[25:41] this is just a place we decided to come
[25:43] to
[25:44] that god tells us to assemble ourselves
[25:47] together
[25:48] all right but the great tabernacle that
[25:50] god's looking at is me and you
[25:53] now israel went through it by motion why
[25:56] because they didn't have the guy inside
[25:58] they didn't have the holy ghost when in
[26:00] leviticus they didn't have the baptism
[26:02] of the holy ghost
[26:04] to teach them and train them what to do
[26:05] they had to be taught and trained by the
[26:07] priest
[26:08] god gave it to moses moses gave it to
[26:10] the priest i read it says moses right
[26:12] here it says what
[26:13] speaking to the children of israel moses
[26:15] saying
[26:16] and he gave him a statute to do he gave
[26:18] him a statute right here on passover
[26:21] this was very important because you know
[26:23] what if you didn't make it past passover
[26:25] you died
[26:25] that's right same way with us
[26:30] you must have a passover amen or you're
[26:33] dead
[26:34] can you say no i'm alive i can work out
[26:37] and i can
[26:38] 60 years old that's pretty good it's
[26:41] dying eventually there'll be more down
[26:44] here than up here don't worry
[26:48] but you know what i told we were talking
[26:50] the other day some of us were
[26:53] listen how important your new birth is
[26:55] because brother branham tells us
[26:57] i'm on tabernacles but i'll get to it in
[26:59] just a minute
[27:00] that brother brown tells us that if you
[27:02] die a sinner
[27:04] you come up in that old same body
[27:06] because what would be the desire of i
[27:09] mean a sinner
[27:09] dies goes over into the fifth dimension
[27:12] and he's young again no that ain't gonna
[27:15] work because they haven't been changed
[27:19] see my change comes here brother my
[27:22] change started at the new birth
[27:25] so this 60 year old guy back when i was
[27:28] 38 years old
[27:32] 39 almost in january there
[27:36] in 1997 1998 in there 1999.
[27:39] i got the new birth i believe my soul
[27:42] was changed not
[27:43] exchanged but i believe i turned back to
[27:47] a new guy
[27:49] a new person
[27:52] my soul went back to that 18 year old
[27:54] why brother brown said god put a picture
[27:58] yes amen before the foundational world
[28:00] he took a picture in the album and he
[28:02] said
[28:03] that's my son that's my daughter these
[28:06] are all my children
[28:07] i know they're going to have to be born
[28:09] i know they might be 67
[28:11] that 90 year old lady
[28:14] got born again and brother brown was
[28:16] meeting 90 years old she lived in sin
[28:19] if she would have died she would have
[28:20] come up a 90 year old woman
[28:22] because it don't change her soul her
[28:25] soul was still just getting as old as
[28:27] her body i'm just
[28:28] that's just me but when she went over
[28:30] that fifth dimension she wasn't happy
[28:32] i'll promise you that
[28:33] but brother tatum brother george brother
[28:35] mike brother moat
[28:38] all downstairs look at their pictures
[28:40] that's the youth you're gonna see
[28:41] because their soul was changed not
[28:44] exchanged
[28:46] the nature of that thing was changed
[28:49] and you turn back to an 18 year old
[28:51] child inside or 18 year old person
[28:53] inside
[28:54] i just believe that because of what
[28:55] brother brown said
[28:57] he said the center will raise in the
[28:59] body that they send in
[29:00] so they're going to raise in their old
[29:02] body
[29:04] no worth to that folks get born again
[29:08] i mean our tabernacles may be getting
[29:11] bad looking you know
[29:12] our bowels our bowels may be drooping
[29:15] down a little bit
[29:18] but god's going to change us he's
[29:20] already changed the inside guy because
[29:22] remember brother brown said you're born
[29:23] in the image of what comes what's inside
[29:25] of you
[29:26] when you take a body change you're going
[29:27] to change to what's on the inside
[29:30] all right so now
[29:35] that's what i should be talking about
[29:37] over here so we have to go through
[29:39] passover
[29:40] we have to go through unleavened bread
[29:42] and remember all those remember no
[29:44] leaven see now eleven remember is a type
[29:47] of sin
[29:48] but remember this is also as we come up
[29:51] to the feast of weeks you've got to bake
[29:53] with leaven to bake or let it rise
[29:58] as two loaves as christ and the bride
[30:01] everybody got that because christ had to
[30:03] come in human flesh
[30:05] okay now remember he wasn't born in sin
[30:08] but he came into this sinful world
[30:11] because he was 30 and yet looked 50.
[30:14] so it wasn't that he continued to stay a
[30:17] young boy again
[30:20] but remember his soul didn't need to be
[30:21] changed
[30:23] he was god almighty he just was trapped
[30:27] in a human body for one purpose
[30:29] and that's redemption one purpose
[30:33] because he could be melchizedek he could
[30:35] be the um
[30:36] me and joshua thomas this morning it
[30:38] could be melchizedek it could be the one
[30:40] that meant
[30:41] joshua that's okay
[30:44] but they were young looking stepped out
[30:47] of a body
[30:48] step right back into eternity jesus
[30:50] christ had to come into this world
[30:53] into satan's eden had to be born in this
[30:55] world
[30:56] to do one thing and that's to bear your
[30:58] sin
[31:00] to bear your sin but he was an eternal
[31:03] person inside
[31:05] i have to put my hope on that because
[31:07] when he went to calvary
[31:09] remember the holy ghost hadn't been
[31:10] given yet but he was the holy ghost
[31:14] what was inside of him was the holy
[31:15] ghost that's what brother brown said
[31:17] broke the blood cell
[31:18] so that the flesh man could die
[31:23] release the life for him to go talk to
[31:26] the
[31:27] people in the prison in hell come back
[31:30] up to paradise pick them up take them to
[31:32] a position
[31:33] and come right back up and pick that
[31:34] body up and when he picked that body up
[31:36] what did he do it turned back into
[31:40] that 18 year old form that i believe
[31:42] what god looked like before the
[31:44] foundation of the world he's a young guy
[31:45] standing out there in eternity
[31:47] not an old man
[31:51] how we gonna be born and changed in his
[31:53] image
[31:55] if he's young we're young amen
[31:58] brother brown proved that by going
[32:00] across the curtain of time and seeing
[32:01] the 90 year old woman
[32:03] he said and the angel lord i kind of you
[32:05] know the angel lord kind of was just
[32:07] i don't know if he's picking on him or
[32:08] not he said don't you remember that girl
[32:11] well no he didn't because she was 90
[32:13] years old when he remembered her on this
[32:15] side
[32:16] but boy to see her on the other side and
[32:18] see he said oh my
[32:20] that's why he said right after that he
[32:21] said don't miss this
[32:23] whatever you do don't miss this the 90
[32:26] year old was an 18 year old girl and he
[32:28] said she'll be that for an eternity
[32:30] but you know what there's a 90 year old
[32:32] body of that girl laying somewhere
[32:35] in the earth in a funeral arming in a in
[32:38] a grave
[32:39] that young person is going to be greater
[32:41] than that person now
[32:43] and that person that's greater is going
[32:45] to mold right back into that body
[32:47] and change it right back into a young
[32:50] woman again
[32:51] amen that's you know what we enjoy that
[32:55] the older ones some of the younger ones
[32:56] are still going
[32:57] what do they mean what they mean they
[33:00] have aches and pains and can't get out
[33:02] of bed except
[33:03] in shifts just just wait
[33:06] i hope you don't have to go through it i
[33:09] hope we're out of here before this
[33:11] all right so he got passover unleavened
[33:13] bread
[33:15] first fruits was the barley harvest
[33:17] remember the what was the first one to
[33:18] come to maturity
[33:20] and we told you what barley was when
[33:22] jesus resurrected
[33:23] remember barley is the um kind of a
[33:26] cheap
[33:27] cheaper um wheat
[33:30] wheat's more expensive because the bible
[33:33] tells us in revelations
[33:35] it's like three times more for wheat
[33:36] than it is for barley but we know what
[33:38] that is because jesus made himself lower
[33:41] than the angels he made himself
[33:43] lower than they they called him
[33:45] everything but jesus christ
[33:47] the son of the living god they called
[33:48] him the devil they called him a wine
[33:50] bible they called him a sinner
[33:52] because he hung around people but now
[33:54] remember they knew he was different
[33:58] they knew there was something different
[34:00] about that guy all right
[34:02] he was trying to save their soul and
[34:04] they wouldn't let him i'm talking about
[34:05] the religious
[34:07] world it's always
[34:11] it's always been fascinating how that
[34:13] when he met that
[34:15] man of gadara the maniac
[34:20] of gabriel you may call it whatever
[34:23] legions of demons was in that man
[34:26] legions
[34:27] and they called him the son of god
[34:31] they declared with their voice thou son
[34:34] of god
[34:34] why have you come here to torment us
[34:38] before our time
[34:39] and then when he turned and went across
[34:40] the ocean went across the sea
[34:43] went into the temple and they're calling
[34:46] him belzebub
[34:47] the religious people of the world that
[34:49] shouldn't have them 1 000 legions of
[34:51] demons
[34:53] to me they had more demons than legion
[34:55] did
[34:56] at least they had more strong ones to
[34:58] call the son of god a devil
[35:00] and satan call him the son of god so
[35:04] but that's what it is now god of this
[35:05] evil age same thing
[35:07] it's blinded the eyes of the people so
[35:09] now we've got the feast of pentecost
[35:11] which is your second harvest
[35:13] have i got that first harvest second
[35:16] harvest feast of weeks
[35:18] which is the wheat harvest where you had
[35:20] to make two loaves of bread
[35:22] with leaven so you had to add this back
[35:25] in because what did god do
[35:26] god didn't change peter on the day of
[35:28] pentecost in his flesh
[35:32] he changed him in his soul not exchange
[35:35] i'm saying that again
[35:36] god doesn't exchange your soul
[35:39] you are who you are who you are all
[35:42] right
[35:44] and that's what god wants to work on he
[35:45] wants to deal with he wants to deal with
[35:46] your soul he don't want to buy you a new
[35:48] one or get you a new one and put
[35:49] no he likes what he's got that's right
[35:53] all right so now that's the feast of
[35:55] pentecost so you got
[35:57] now look when did the day of pentecost
[36:01] happen it was on the what
[36:03] 50th day which is the eighth day
[36:10] which is the eighth day you say how
[36:12] seven sevens is 49 you keep your seven
[36:15] cycle
[36:16] it was one day extra
[36:19] which is the eighth day so the
[36:22] so the baptism of the holy ghost come on
[36:24] the eighth day
[36:26] you and i the baptism of holy ghost came
[36:28] on your what
[36:29] eighth day called you out of the what
[36:33] church age that you're in the seventh
[36:35] church age that you're in
[36:36] called you out of it
[36:41] we're not going to get the feast of
[36:42] tabernacles i don't think
[36:47] but that feast of pentecost changed them
[36:49] inside
[36:51] all right so now you've got
[36:55] your feast of first fruits which was
[36:58] barley
[36:59] jesus christ raised from the dead all
[37:02] right
[37:02] he said i'll be right back so he came
[37:06] back on the eighth day on the day of
[37:07] pentecost outside of the sevens
[37:09] that's why the jubilee year counting to
[37:12] you remember i read it
[37:13] trumpets and the feasts of the trumpets
[37:16] it's 49 years and then one more year
[37:18] which is not another year
[37:20] it's the one year of the next 49 year
[37:23] cycle
[37:24] which what makes this circle
[37:27] all right makes a circle all right we
[37:30] spoke about that long time ago
[37:32] all right so the feast of pentecost so
[37:34] that's the feast of weeks
[37:36] because of seven sevens so the 50th day
[37:39] the holy ghost came
[37:41] and then we've had a long period brother
[37:43] brown tells us
[37:45] a long period of dry summer which it's
[37:47] not it's not dry
[37:48] it may be dry to the world but it's not
[37:50] dry to the people that receive the
[37:51] baptism of the holy ghost
[37:53] because from this day right here
[37:56] until this day i'm talking about not 12
[37:59] or 24 hour day i'm talking about the day
[38:01] of the lord the day
[38:02] the the seven church ages all right
[38:05] because there you have your feast of
[38:07] weeks you're seven church ages we've
[38:08] been through seven church ages
[38:11] where god has each each age has had a
[38:14] pentecost
[38:16] they had their own day of pentecost not
[38:19] one day though
[38:22] it spread out now to where every day is
[38:24] the day of pentecost
[38:25] all right every day is the day of first
[38:27] fruits unleavened bread passover
[38:28] different ones
[38:29] because there's people getting born
[38:30] again every day now
[38:32] on that day of pentecost it was 120
[38:36] on that day and 3 000.
[38:40] right but then see that spread by
[38:42] spiritual multiplication that spread out
[38:44] through the church ages
[38:47] spread out through the church ages each
[38:49] one having a messenger to bring the
[38:51] message to that age everybody got that
[38:52] say amen
[38:53] and what is that message here we come to
[38:55] the trumpets
[38:57] that we were talking about a couple of
[38:58] sundays ago we come to the feast of
[39:00] trumpets what is trumpets
[39:02] trumpets is a noise or trumpets is a
[39:05] voice or trumpet is a sound
[39:08] and we read the different things about
[39:10] the feasts of the trumpets
[39:13] now let's go to leviticus 23 23 just to
[39:15] review if i don't get finished we'll
[39:16] finish winning tonight
[39:18] that'll be okay and the lord speaking to
[39:21] moses and speaking of the children of
[39:22] israel standing in the seventh month now
[39:24] remember we're in the set
[39:25] we're in the fall feast
[39:28] all right we're in the fall feast where
[39:30] they harvest corn
[39:31] and fruit that sound familiar
[39:36] okay speaking of the children of israel
[39:38] saying in the seventh month
[39:39] in the first day of the month shall you
[39:41] have a sabbath a memorial of blowing of
[39:43] trumpets
[39:44] on holy convocation you shall do no
[39:46] servile work therein but you shall offer
[39:48] an offering made by fire
[39:49] unto the lord now we go to first
[39:51] corinthians
[39:54] 14 verse 7 even things without life
[39:58] giving sound where the pipe or harp
[40:00] except they give a distinction
[40:02] in the sound how shall it be known what
[40:06] is piped or heart how do you know that
[40:10] william branham was right
[40:14] how you know we're not supposed to be
[40:15] following
[40:18] fill in the blank how do you know that
[40:21] because that trumpet of
[40:25] others have given uncertain sound
[40:28] like i said before you be sitting in the
[40:30] congregation i have several times and i
[40:32] i am not critical of preachers because
[40:35] preachers can
[40:36] do you good but they said uncle do you
[40:38] also do you harm
[40:39] and they can also tell you things that
[40:41] are not right
[40:43] okay for if the trumpet give an
[40:45] uncertain sound and then that little
[40:46] something inside of you what is it
[40:48] it's that man in the control tower going
[40:51] wait a minute
[40:53] wait a minute let's put that in the
[40:55] bible let's put that in the prophet's
[40:57] message you got to put them both
[40:58] together
[41:00] because if that trumpet given uncertain
[41:02] sound who shall prepare himself to
[41:04] battle
[41:05] listen i almost giggled out loud
[41:09] he was talking about the four combat
[41:10] beasts he kept saying combat beasts
[41:12] combat beast and the thought came to me
[41:15] yeah
[41:15] lord you didn't call him the four picnic
[41:18] beast
[41:20] right you didn't call them before picnic
[41:22] beasts whether you know it's
[41:23] like an and a slug and no they're combat
[41:26] beasts they're
[41:27] lying they're ox the man in the eagle
[41:30] combat something to fight with
[41:34] yes who shall prepare himself to battle
[41:38] that's why i thought of the quote where
[41:39] brother brown said this is not a picnic
[41:41] this is the battle so i said lord you
[41:42] didn't send this picnic beast you sent
[41:44] us
[41:44] combat beasts and they will if we'll
[41:47] just
[41:48] if we'll just let that what as ezekiel
[41:51] says let that one come to the forefront
[41:54] right if you need the line if you need
[41:56] the opposite man and the eagles right
[41:57] here inside of you don't have to call to
[41:58] get it
[42:01] but thank god see that a prophet a
[42:04] trumpet
[42:05] told us that those four combat beasts
[42:08] were the baptism of the holy ghost you
[42:09] won't hear that from anybody else
[42:11] but now that i read it in the bible see
[42:14] now that you read it in the bible with
[42:15] an
[42:16] open book you see it all the way down
[42:20] through how the lion did his work the ox
[42:22] did his work
[42:23] and then brother branham goes and puts
[42:24] them in the church ages
[42:27] first three church ages the boldness of
[42:28] a line they stepped out peter
[42:30] said silver and gold have i none
[42:34] columba's age it was just the ox you
[42:36] know the labor it was just a whole 1500
[42:38] years of dark ages
[42:40] they barely made it through that ox
[42:42] labor you know
[42:43] not very fast but pulls a lot of weight
[42:46] all right same way with you and i
[42:47] brother ryan said we need that every day
[42:51] all right then you've got what the
[42:53] intelligence of man now look not the
[42:55] intelligence of man
[42:58] but the intelligence in the statue of a
[43:00] perfect man that knowledge
[43:03] that the holy ghost gives you is holy
[43:04] ghost knowledge
[43:06] comes from the man anointing all right
[43:10] but now remember too we had a man
[43:12] anointing down here on earth because
[43:13] look in the time of luther and wesley
[43:15] and toward pentecost
[43:16] the the age of of people building stuff
[43:19] you know
[43:19] you went from a buggy to a car
[43:23] right you had all these different
[43:24] communication everything happened during
[43:26] the man intelligence part
[43:28] but god was given the intelligence from
[43:30] luther and wesley and pentecost
[43:32] and given it to us in the intelligence
[43:36] of god not the intelligence of man sure
[43:38] we use the intelligence of man
[43:41] you have to to go to school and do all
[43:42] the different things and
[43:44] but when it's contrary to the word of
[43:46] god
[43:48] you go back to god's intelligence you go
[43:51] back to god's knowledge
[43:52] all right so likewise ye accept ye
[43:55] utter by the tongue words easy to be
[43:58] understood
[43:59] how shall it be known what is spoken for
[44:01] you shall speak into the air
[44:04] listen if this i'm going to say this if
[44:07] it's not an inspired word of god you're
[44:09] just speaking in the air
[44:13] you're just speaking into the air that's
[44:15] why jesus said he said
[44:17] my words will not return void
[44:20] but will accomplish what it said that's
[44:22] why i read that quote where brother
[44:24] brown said well you've done all you can
[44:25] do
[44:26] stand right there say god you said it
[44:29] and i'm gonna stand right here
[44:30] kind of like that guy that says lord if
[44:32] you don't save me you're gonna find a
[44:33] bag of dry bones right here in this
[44:35] in this spot because i'm not moving well
[44:37] see when we get that desperate then see
[44:39] god moves on the scene
[44:41] instead of us just saying you know half
[44:43] a minute prayer and going on
[44:45] but for shall who for ye shall speak
[44:48] into the air so it's got to have what
[44:50] this message this word of god has
[44:52] substance
[44:54] because remember when we get into this
[44:56] we ever get the tabernacles
[44:58] john 1 just
[45:01] absolutely nails it when he said the
[45:05] word
[45:06] was made flesh
[45:12] and that word dwelt
[45:16] is interpreted as tabernacle
[45:20] so he said that word was made flesh
[45:24] and tabernacled he made a booth just
[45:26] like he required them in israel to make
[45:28] a booth
[45:29] he made a booth to live in called
[45:32] jesus christ all right
[45:36] all right now let's go to first
[45:37] corinthians 15 51 because look that
[45:40] trumpet look where it happened it didn't
[45:42] happen over here in your new birth
[45:44] you were a baby don't pull the chart up
[45:47] but you were a baby
[45:49] you were in your springtime because you
[45:52] got four spring fish you got three fall
[45:54] fees
[45:54] but now remember from your new birth
[45:57] until that trumpet sounding is a journey
[46:02] it's a journey you go through we've all
[46:03] been through but there's going to be a
[46:05] time when this says behold i show you a
[46:07] mystery we shall not all sleep
[46:09] but we shall all be changed in a moment
[46:11] in the twinkling of an eye what
[46:13] at the last trump this is it
[46:16] there is no other trumpeter no other
[46:18] messenger to come no other porter
[46:23] listen folks if christ don't come on the
[46:25] scene like he said he would
[46:27] then what are we looking for
[46:35] that's what i was thinking you know
[46:36] everybody said well you know this is the
[46:38] time of for
[46:39] this is the time for jesus to come jesus
[46:41] come
[46:42] you know they push this thing off even
[46:44] denominations they
[46:45] in the catholic church they keep him on
[46:46] the cross
[46:49] okay jesus died for me two thousand
[46:51] years ago okay
[46:53] that's good right but you got to take
[46:56] that and put that life in here if you
[46:58] don't put that life in here then
[47:00] you're just going through motions right
[47:03] see that's why brother brown i believe
[47:04] the last trump for the trumpeter sound
[47:06] he gave brother branham two messages
[47:09] this messenger malachi 4 will do two
[47:11] things
[47:13] number one restore back the faith of the
[47:16] fathers
[47:16] take us back to that first day holy
[47:18] convocation
[47:20] and then something that's never been
[47:23] revealed
[47:24] in the seven days of feast
[47:29] only in the eighth day holy convocation
[47:32] was that revealed right and that's what
[47:34] come to me and you
[47:35] but you gotta have an eight day new
[47:37] birth first right
[47:39] if not you're just sitting there in a
[47:40] cycle of sevens
[47:44] you won't have a jubilee year
[47:47] no we're in we've already entered in our
[47:49] 50 our jubilee
[47:51] because that's what the day of pentecost
[47:52] was it was on the penta
[47:54] 50th day they received the holy ghost
[47:57] and on your 50th day
[47:59] you received the holy ghost not 24-hour
[48:02] day
[48:03] but in the day of the lord that's why i
[48:04] said i love
[48:07] when john says i was in the lord's day
[48:09] and it took a profit
[48:12] to tell us that that wasn't a 24-hour
[48:14] day
[48:15] that was the day that john was living in
[48:17] like he said oh he said arm of neville
[48:19] the day that arma neville lives in is
[48:21] the day that the revelation is when the
[48:23] armor devil's on the earth
[48:24] so what's ours we're the eighth day
[48:29] in spirit but it's re or so but it's
[48:32] required
[48:35] this is required reading or required
[48:38] revelation
[48:39] that we take this thing into the eighth
[48:40] day
[48:42] nobody else has had to do that seven
[48:44] sevens they just continued in that seven
[48:46] year cycle and the seven sevens is 49
[48:48] and
[48:50] but somebody in a moment
[48:53] in the twinkling of an eye
[48:56] at the last trump you got to get into
[48:58] first
[48:59] trump the first part of the message
[49:03] then the trumpet shall sound to me
[49:05] that's the blast of those seven thunders
[49:11] that reveals you into the eight that
[49:13] takes this into the eighth day
[49:15] but you know what we've got to accept it
[49:17] up here first what have you heard all
[49:19] your life what have you heard all your
[49:21] life
[49:22] by and by i'm gonna die
[49:26] right death has reigned
[49:31] the bible says from adam until now
[49:33] that's right
[49:35] and it's still raining r-e-i-g
[49:39] rain not r-a-i-n all right rain
[49:42] did i spell that right yeah okay
[49:46] death has reigned in other words you and
[49:48] i know
[49:50] that when we're born into this world
[49:53] we come to acknowledge especially some
[49:55] of us that are a little bit
[49:56] dark i mean lighter on the top
[50:00] realize that we're heading toward the
[50:03] sundown of our life
[50:05] and if something doesn't happen sun's
[50:08] going to go down
[50:09] but now not on the inside guys see it's
[50:12] already entered into that eighth day
[50:14] that's why if we ever get to it if we
[50:16] don't get to it we'll get to it
[50:17] wednesday
[50:18] that that's why brother branham that
[50:19] great revelation
[50:21] they said brother brown you've run out
[50:22] of your types you've seven you've seven
[50:24] you've seven you're seven he said hold
[50:25] on
[50:26] got one more because remember
[50:29] literally you and i are gonna stay in
[50:32] this seven
[50:34] day or a week cycle month cycle whatever
[50:36] you wanna call it
[50:37] we're staying in a seven cycle
[50:40] now look we've already passed from death
[50:42] into life but i'm telling you physically
[50:44] even when we come back the millennium
[50:46] will still be
[50:47] a seven day rest right it will not be
[50:50] the eighth day that's why
[50:51] thank god for a prophet that he showed a
[50:54] scripture over here
[50:56] that was only for the millennium
[50:59] he showed a scripture over here that was
[51:01] only for the future home future home
[51:05] who in the world thought of a future
[51:06] home
[51:08] because you have people that don't even
[51:09] believe in the millennium you got people
[51:11] in the message that think we're already
[51:12] in the millennium
[51:13] take them to a zoo
[51:17] throw them in with the tigers and we'll
[51:18] find out whether in the millennium or
[51:19] not
[51:21] but we
[51:24] are waiting for that future home
[51:27] not the millennium the millennium's not
[51:30] to us
[51:32] it's to israel because of that last day
[51:36] right that's right they'll build
[51:39] and they'll inhabit the future home
[51:42] folks has already been built
[51:45] it was built by your desire you have
[51:48] your own little god's green acre
[51:52] when you got born again you got a part
[51:54] of the city
[51:56] literally not just figuratively
[51:59] cause nothing's gonna live in that city
[52:01] that didn't have the new birth while
[52:03] they were on earth
[52:04] i i just don't see that that's what
[52:06] brother brown said
[52:08] and then we read the we read the
[52:10] scripture that now says the lamb will be
[52:11] the light
[52:13] in the city well guess what if the
[52:15] lamb's delight you and i are going to be
[52:16] the light
[52:20] because it glows all through us because
[52:22] what she is him
[52:24] amen and the moment in the twinkling of
[52:26] an eye to last trump a lot of people
[52:28] heard that last trump
[52:31] but did they hear the trumpet that
[52:34] sounded that the dead shall be raised
[52:36] incorruptible
[52:37] no they have not because a lot of them
[52:39] are already still
[52:41] as we said brother mo brother all the
[52:43] different ones is passed on they're
[52:45] waiting on us
[52:46] now they heard the last trump right
[52:51] but they didn't hear the last trumpet
[52:53] right
[52:54] that trumpet is that seventh under
[52:56] virtue
[52:58] they thought it was see it's not seven
[53:01] virtues or seven men with different
[53:03] virtues
[53:04] it's what it's a revelation
[53:07] that you're being changed
[53:10] and then in the moment in the twinkling
[53:12] of an eye
[53:14] at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[53:17] sound
[53:18] and the dead shall be raised
[53:19] incorruptible and
[53:21] we shall be changed
[53:24] i'll guarantee you you start seeing the
[53:26] dead walk that were dead before
[53:28] not dead asleep the ones that were
[53:30] asleep in christ they died in christ
[53:32] before
[53:33] listen we're all dead in christ right
[53:34] now
[53:36] that's why i said you we read that
[53:37] scripture wrong says the dead in christ
[53:39] there's nobody
[53:41] physically dead in christ that's right
[53:44] i said physically they died because
[53:49] of the curse
[53:52] but they died in christ when we put them
[53:54] in a watery grave and they came up and
[53:56] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[53:57] that's when they died
[53:59] so now i am already dead in christ
[54:02] paul says i die daily i'm working on a
[54:06] sermon brother louise
[54:07] the power of death
[54:10] we think death is this i'm going to die
[54:18] a lot of things that's connected with
[54:19] death has a lot of power to it
[54:23] if jesus hadn't died
[54:27] he couldn't have stood up and said all
[54:28] power and heaven and earth's been given
[54:30] unto me
[54:31] amen so that's why brother brown says
[54:33] why do we fear death
[54:36] we're already dead is wherever gonna be
[54:41] all right we'll get to this in a minute
[54:42] now day of atonement
[54:47] so that's the trumpet we have heard the
[54:50] noise
[54:51] that's going to wake up the saints
[54:55] brother brown said rapture in faith lies
[54:56] in these books and tapes
[54:58] we've just got to get a five-fold
[55:00] ministry to put it all together
[55:02] and that we don't put it together god
[55:06] puts it together
[55:07] you hear the part you need
[55:11] to have rapture in faith
[55:15] amen but i'm going to depend on that
[55:18] because i'm going to stand right here it
[55:19] doesn't matter if i get 60 65
[55:21] 70. some of y'all will be way older than
[55:23] that
[55:26] anyway
[55:32] but i'm going to depend on that that
[55:34] trump sounded that trump
[55:37] sounded yes i heard that voice and i
[55:41] asked god to forgive me of my sins and
[55:43] he didn't just
[55:44] birth me into the body of christ
[55:47] he gave me this message because that's
[55:50] the last trumpet yeah i'll clap too that
[55:52] was the last
[55:54] trumpet that you and i are going to hear
[55:56] like i said can you realize that listen
[55:58] we don't get a trumpet to israel
[56:03] they'll get a beautiful message from two
[56:06] prophets
[56:07] not to us
[56:14] we have this is it the last trumpet
[56:19] our feast of trumpets we are continually
[56:23] in it
[56:24] because to the to the bride i say the
[56:27] bride not just christianity to the bride
[56:31] these are all continual feasts
[56:35] every day we get up i remember that
[56:36] passover
[56:38] that man that died for me because i say
[56:40] lord jesus help me through this day
[56:43] well i'm talking to the passover lamb
[56:46] the guy that died for me
[56:48] and the unleavened bread and the first
[56:51] fruits
[56:51] that there's a resurrection every day in
[56:53] our life
[56:55] amen and then there's a pentecost and
[56:58] then there's a trumpet and then we look
[57:00] right here at this
[57:01] day of atonement now i love that day of
[57:03] atonement
[57:04] because it really tells us
[57:07] i believe the day of atonement told
[57:10] natural israel
[57:12] where they were
[57:16] because what they were atoning for they
[57:17] were they were they had to have
[57:19] a day that a priest
[57:23] took one sacrifice back behind the veil
[57:27] he had to make one for himself first he
[57:30] didn't go back there with beer on his
[57:31] breath
[57:32] amen he didn't go back there with
[57:34] adultery on his breath
[57:37] he had to be amen
[57:40] so he had to make her sacrifice for
[57:42] himself
[57:44] and for his family before he walked in
[57:51] listen i know we ministers you should
[57:53] never hold a minister up because i
[57:55] promise you
[57:56] we'll fall
[57:59] okay but we have to be careful
[58:02] every day of our life brother brown told
[58:05] us money women in popularity and you see
[58:07] how many those three
[58:08] have killed a ministry of somebody
[58:11] even so very recently of different ones
[58:14] so
[58:15] we have you know why because we're the
[58:17] ones that we got the blood
[58:19] god requires the first fruit
[58:26] god gives the revelation to the prophet
[58:28] the prophet preached 1100 sermons to me
[58:31] this is so simple
[58:32] why convoluted he gave us 1100 sermons
[58:37] then he took brother brown said i give
[58:39] you the big nuggets that's right
[58:41] and now i want you to take the little
[58:44] nut take the big nuggets
[58:45] what go into your study pound out the
[58:49] gold
[58:52] into little nuggets because
[58:55] mama eagle can't feed you a whole
[58:57] chicken
[58:59] amen remember we talked about that
[59:02] eagles don't eat milk
[59:04] drink milk they eat meat but mama eagle
[59:07] chews it up
[59:10] mama eagle sits in her study and she
[59:13] chews it up
[59:14] and then whatever your heart desires
[59:17] when you
[59:17] open up mama eagle put that little bit
[59:21] of meat
[59:22] that little bit of meat that you need to
[59:24] me it's so simple
[59:26] so simple that that's what that god's
[59:27] give us a fivefold ministry
[59:32] and we don't need a great big convention
[59:34] hall to have it in
[59:39] dan heard both trumpet they hadn't heard
[59:41] they might have heard of trump
[59:43] but they didn't hear the trumpet because
[59:46] the trumpet
[59:46] has to come from a fivefold ministry the
[59:49] trump came from brother branham this is
[59:51] what i believe
[59:52] the trump the message hey
[59:55] god said hey yeah hey here it is
[59:59] now you take and declare with your
[1:00:02] trumpet
[1:00:03] that's right watchman
[1:00:07] watchman you're in your tower what do
[1:00:09] you see
[1:00:12] and then you speak against him that's
[1:00:13] just what to me that's the way god give
[1:00:15] it to us
[1:00:16] and it's so simple and the lord spoken
[1:00:20] to moses saying on the day of atonement
[1:00:21] also on the tenth day of the seventh
[1:00:23] month now remember the first day was a
[1:00:24] blowing of trumpets
[1:00:25] get ready get ready something's coming
[1:00:30] you've got 10 days remember i read the
[1:00:32] commentary you've got 10 days
[1:00:34] to get yourself straightened out because
[1:00:36] on this day of atonement that priest is
[1:00:38] going in and he's going to do
[1:00:40] one sacrifice right then he's going to
[1:00:43] bring two goats in
[1:00:46] oh how perfect also on the tenth day of
[1:00:48] the seventh month there should be a day
[1:00:50] of atonement
[1:00:51] it shall be a holy convocation unto you
[1:00:53] and you shall afflict yours
[1:00:54] this is the first time that word comes
[1:00:56] up you shall afflict your souls
[1:01:00] way down deep inside listen
[1:01:03] unleavened bread that's cleaning up the
[1:01:06] outside
[1:01:07] that's getting all the trash out but now
[1:01:10] god says you need to dig down
[1:01:12] deep find out
[1:01:15] as brother tom falbus said if you've got
[1:01:18] the stuff
[1:01:21] afflict your souls and offer an offering
[1:01:23] made by fire to the lord why because
[1:01:25] you're getting ready to go build you a
[1:01:28] house a little
[1:01:29] temporary tabernacle
[1:01:32] and that's where you're going to have to
[1:01:33] stay for a little while
[1:01:35] okay you shall afflict your soul and
[1:01:38] offer an offering made by fire
[1:01:40] unto the lord and you shall do no work
[1:01:42] in that same day
[1:01:44] for it is a day of atonement to make an
[1:01:46] atonement for you before the lord
[1:01:49] your god now the hebrew lexicon tells us
[1:01:52] just redoing what we did last week make
[1:01:55] an attempt to purge
[1:01:57] to cover cover over with pitch
[1:02:01] to pacify or propitiate
[1:02:05] to cover a tone for sin make atonement
[1:02:08] for
[1:02:09] cover over now look see their
[1:02:13] problem in the old testament was that's
[1:02:15] all it done
[1:02:17] the blood of bulls and goats god said
[1:02:18] okay for one year
[1:02:21] i'm not gonna remember that anymore
[1:02:25] because we're gonna do two things we're
[1:02:27] gonna kill one
[1:02:28] goat we're gonna take the blood of that
[1:02:30] goat sprinkle it on the
[1:02:32] scapegoat and we're going to send it out
[1:02:34] far as the east is from the west i'm not
[1:02:36] going to remember that sin anymore
[1:02:38] but what happened is in the old
[1:02:40] testament i know this is elementary but
[1:02:41] we're going to back up a little bit to
[1:02:42] help everybody
[1:02:46] excuse me but
[1:02:49] that scapegoat was the second one
[1:02:52] and took the scent away
[1:02:56] but now next year in october or
[1:02:59] september october is what
[1:03:00] it's half and half everybody got that
[1:03:02] remember it's not exactly it's the moon
[1:03:04] phase
[1:03:05] but anyway in the fall in october the
[1:03:08] priest had to redo it all over again
[1:03:12] because the sin had piled up underneath
[1:03:16] and god was going to say hey i'm going
[1:03:19] to start killing these people
[1:03:22] because i can't stand it their sin has
[1:03:24] went all the way to heaven
[1:03:26] so the high priest makes an atonement
[1:03:28] for himself he gets himself ready with
[1:03:30] the message
[1:03:31] and then he takes that blood of the bull
[1:03:35] he takes it in and all the sin of the
[1:03:39] people
[1:03:40] are on him that's why jesus christ was
[1:03:42] our high priest
[1:03:45] he took our sin into the holy of holies
[1:03:49] and didn't just cover it remember in
[1:03:52] hebrews or romans
[1:03:54] paul picks that up and he says now every
[1:03:56] year there was a sacrifice
[1:03:58] made for sins that were committed and he
[1:04:01] said if it hadn't been for jesus christ
[1:04:02] he said then we still would be continued
[1:04:04] doing that
[1:04:04] and they were still doing it and they
[1:04:06] still do it now
[1:04:08] because to them christ hasn't come right
[1:04:11] but now remember they don't have the
[1:04:13] items to do it with now
[1:04:14] that's what they're trying to get the
[1:04:16] temple mount people and all the
[1:04:17] different ones
[1:04:18] they know they sin
[1:04:23] they know they have problems with the
[1:04:24] lord
[1:04:26] but all they got to do is receive jesus
[1:04:27] christ not try to make a sacrifice
[1:04:30] that's why i see their eyes are
[1:04:31] literally blinded just like that right
[1:04:34] there
[1:04:35] so that me and you can come in but buddy
[1:04:38] when that thing comes off
[1:04:40] talk about a day of atonement talk about
[1:04:43] a day when 144
[1:04:45] 000 are going to mourn
[1:04:49] that they have already killed the
[1:04:52] messiah
[1:04:52] it's been 2 000 years
[1:04:57] but just like joseph said joseph said
[1:05:00] don't worry
[1:05:01] remember when he revealed himself to
[1:05:03] benjamin and all that he revealed
[1:05:04] himself to them
[1:05:05] what's the first thing they said oh man
[1:05:08] we deceived him and we killed him
[1:05:10] well supposedly killed him way back when
[1:05:13] we put him in a pit and we did away with
[1:05:16] our brother
[1:05:18] said oh lord he's so powerful now all
[1:05:20] he's got to do is say die
[1:05:21] and we die right he was the right hand
[1:05:24] of pharaoh whatever he whatever joseph
[1:05:25] said that's what happened
[1:05:27] but what did joseph tell him he said i
[1:05:30] hadn't forgot you
[1:05:32] he said i've known you for the whole
[1:05:33] time you've been gone
[1:05:35] he said i've been watching after you he
[1:05:37] said don't you remember i told you to
[1:05:38] come over here for my protection
[1:05:41] go to israel uh come back into the
[1:05:44] homeland
[1:05:46] for some protection and he said it was
[1:05:49] done to preserve
[1:05:50] life in other words it was done for him
[1:05:52] to get a gentile bride
[1:05:55] took her to the palace and left her
[1:05:57] there and came back to reveal himself
[1:06:00] to the little benjamin group the 144 000
[1:06:04] that's why that day of atonement is so
[1:06:05] important
[1:06:07] where they say where did you get those
[1:06:09] scars
[1:06:11] he says in the house of my friends
[1:06:15] in zechariah what a gracious god
[1:06:19] but every year they're going through the
[1:06:22] ritual
[1:06:23] motions of it every year
[1:06:26] and don't even realize but when they do
[1:06:29] realize
[1:06:30] you know what them old orthodox jews are
[1:06:32] going to do every one of them i believe
[1:06:34] are going to turn back to these feast
[1:06:36] days
[1:06:37] they're going to turn back to leviticus
[1:06:38] and they're going to read them feast
[1:06:39] days and then two prophets are going to
[1:06:41] preach them jesus christ
[1:06:43] and they're going to go boom the trumpet
[1:06:46] will sound
[1:06:48] right for them that feast of trumpets
[1:06:51] will be the trumpet that sounds through
[1:06:53] two witnesses
[1:06:54] that bring them to their day of
[1:06:56] atonement and then what's going to
[1:06:58] happen
[1:06:59] they're going to receive the baptism of
[1:07:01] the holy ghost in their booth
[1:07:05] and be taken in a rapture but now see
[1:07:07] remember
[1:07:08] they in titan have to bring that booth
[1:07:11] back to the millennium you and i
[1:07:14] remember there for a honeymoon
[1:07:15] they've got work to do according to
[1:07:17] daniel 70 weeks according to the book of
[1:07:19] ezekiel
[1:07:20] they got to build a temple
[1:07:24] and i want to read you something here in
[1:07:26] just a minute that i found out
[1:07:28] if we ever get to it
[1:07:32] but we know one thing's for sure we know
[1:07:35] what the two
[1:07:35] let's not we won't read that commentary
[1:07:37] brother joe just go ahead and go to the
[1:07:38] feast of tabernacles
[1:07:39] all right let's go leviticus 25 8.
[1:07:43] because we know on the feast of
[1:07:44] atonement they have two goats i told you
[1:07:46] one was a scapegoat and the other one
[1:07:47] was
[1:07:48] a goat they killed sprinkled the blood
[1:07:51] they sprinkled the blood on the
[1:07:52] scapegoat
[1:07:53] and a man took that scapegoat so far
[1:07:56] away that he never would come back
[1:07:58] same way with god and your sin take it
[1:08:00] so far away
[1:08:01] because one goat remember both goats are
[1:08:03] jesus christ
[1:08:05] one they literally killed him and put
[1:08:07] him on a cross right but then when he
[1:08:10] came back on the day of pentecost
[1:08:12] he didn't just cover their blood with
[1:08:15] cover them with blood
[1:08:16] he eradicated their sin by the blood
[1:08:22] the atonement the atonement was made
[1:08:25] the atonement was made don't have to
[1:08:26] make another one anymore don't have to
[1:08:28] go year by year as paul tells there in
[1:08:30] romans or
[1:08:31] or somewhere in there now look leviticus
[1:08:33] 25 eight now
[1:08:34] number seven here we go with the sevens
[1:08:36] again i want to make that point but
[1:08:38] watch
[1:08:41] seven times seven years the space of the
[1:08:42] seventh sabbath now this has to do with
[1:08:44] the trumpets i think i misput this
[1:08:46] i put this in the wrong place but we're
[1:08:47] gonna read it anyway then shalt thou
[1:08:49] cause the trumpet of the jubilee to
[1:08:51] sound on the tenth day of the seventh
[1:08:54] month
[1:08:55] and the day of atonement shall you make
[1:08:57] no it covers both
[1:08:59] in the day of atonement shall you make
[1:09:01] the trumpet sound so on the day of
[1:09:03] atonement
[1:09:04] you could go free on your day of
[1:09:07] atonement
[1:09:08] you went free oh no i got this sent
[1:09:13] you hadn't put it on that scapegoat yet
[1:09:16] you need to put that thing on that
[1:09:17] scapegoat and let god almighty carry
[1:09:20] that thing and put it in let him drop
[1:09:22] off in the sea of god's forgetfulness
[1:09:24] never never to be remembered
[1:09:28] again all right let's go feast the
[1:09:31] tabernacles we got just about 15 minutes
[1:09:33] maybe here
[1:09:36] so pull the chart back up just one more
[1:09:38] time no joke please
[1:09:42] i kind of like that how that went down
[1:09:43] it came up pretty neat
[1:09:46] so we're right here it's called sukkot
[1:09:48] or
[1:09:49] booths or the feast have been gathering
[1:09:51] because it is the last harvest you
[1:09:54] gather
[1:09:54] in the harvest this is the last harvest
[1:09:59] the harvest of corn and
[1:10:03] fruit hmm
[1:10:06] i am the vine you are the branches
[1:10:10] what bears the fruit the branches
[1:10:14] amen what a great type all the way
[1:10:18] through so here we are on the feast of
[1:10:19] tabernacles the last
[1:10:21] feast so we've went through it by the
[1:10:24] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:10:26] to me our day of atonement is is when we
[1:10:29] realize we need these
[1:10:32] these virtues there's a lot of people
[1:10:37] who don't realize they need them but the
[1:10:40] bible says
[1:10:41] and brother brown says they're required
[1:10:45] and once you realize they're acquired oh
[1:10:47] what a day of atonement
[1:10:52] you realize that that blood didn't stop
[1:10:55] down here when you received the holy
[1:10:56] ghost no you
[1:10:57] come back into the court outer court
[1:11:00] inner court
[1:11:01] holy of holies what does the holy of
[1:11:02] holies do take away your sin
[1:11:06] sister shepherd what does it do balls of
[1:11:08] trash out
[1:11:10] amen seals it in with what
[1:11:14] the holy spirit
[1:11:17] which is the type of the day of
[1:11:20] atonement
[1:11:21] that you realize something died for you
[1:11:25] and not that just jesus died for your
[1:11:27] sins that's okay you know that's
[1:11:28] wonderful
[1:11:30] but what about now jesus christ died
[1:11:34] from my sin yet i still curse
[1:11:36] jesus christ took away my sin yet i
[1:11:38] still you know put put it in there
[1:11:40] whatever it is
[1:11:40] put it inside there you can't do that
[1:11:45] and then going up the statue of a
[1:11:46] perfect man yeah i had a
[1:11:48] well i didn't have much of a temper but
[1:11:50] i was temperamental
[1:11:53] ain't much difference bob that's just
[1:11:56] not
[1:11:57] don't laugh like that
[1:12:00] but he's still working on me
[1:12:03] make me what you know what that's that
[1:12:05] day of atonement i have to realize
[1:12:07] again that that goat is gone
[1:12:12] whatever goat you had god sprinkled it
[1:12:15] with his blood
[1:12:17] and sent it out now what we're doing
[1:12:18] we're going
[1:12:24] let it go let it go
[1:12:28] that's why that yeah sure the 144
[1:12:30] thousand in
[1:12:31] zechariah they're gonna mourn
[1:12:34] but after that morning m-o-u-r-n-i-n-g
[1:12:38] mourn after that what a joyous time
[1:12:43] because they're gonna realize god has
[1:12:45] come back
[1:12:47] to get them in their tabernacle
[1:12:51] leviticus 23 verse 34.
[1:12:54] speaking the children of israel saying
[1:12:56] on the 15th day of the seventh month

[1:15:49] shall keep it a feast unto the lord
[1:15:52] seven days in the year it shall be a
[1:15:54] statute forever in your generations you
[1:15:57] shall celebrate it
[1:15:58] in the seventh month you shall dwell in
[1:16:01] booth seven days
[1:16:02] so seven church ages you've dwelt god
[1:16:05] has dwelt
[1:16:06] in booths for seven church ages
[1:16:09] but there comes an eighth day on the
[1:16:10] outside of that
[1:16:12] and that's the benefit you and i get for
[1:16:15] listening to the last
[1:16:17] trumpet that your generation may know
[1:16:20] that i made the children of israel to
[1:16:22] dwell in boost when i brought them out
[1:16:23] of the land of egypt
[1:16:25] i am the lord your god
[1:16:28] let's go to deuteronomy 16 verse 13.
[1:16:33] thou shall observe the feast of
[1:16:35] tabernacles seven days
[1:16:37] after that yeah here it is after that
[1:16:38] thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy
[1:16:40] wine now remember what makes wine
[1:16:42] grapes fruit fruit does not grapefruit
[1:16:44] fruit all right
[1:16:46] and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast thou
[1:16:49] and thy son and thy
[1:16:50] everybody nobody's excluded
[1:16:55] look manservant maidservant
[1:16:59] levi bring in the strangers
[1:17:03] the fatherless the widow
[1:17:06] that are within thy gates seven days
[1:17:09] shall thou keep a solemn feast unto the
[1:17:11] lord thy god in the place which the lord
[1:17:13] shall choose
[1:17:14] now where did where did he choose to
[1:17:16] place himself brother brown said
[1:17:18] in the heart of man not in a building
[1:17:20] not a tabernacle out there in the heart
[1:17:22] of man
[1:17:23] and the lord thy god shall bless thee in
[1:17:26] all thine and in
[1:17:30] all the works of thine hands
[1:17:34] therefore thou shalt surely
[1:17:38] rejoice surely rejoice
[1:17:42] let's let brother branham
[1:17:46] now remember this is the future home
[1:17:52] and he's telling us now you got your
[1:17:55] sevens
[1:17:56] you got you're an eighth day so look say
[1:17:58] well now brother branham
[1:18:00] you've done run out you got your seven
[1:18:02] aaron you're gonna have a problem
[1:18:03] they're already asleep now
[1:18:06] so are you all right let's take the last
[1:18:09] feast
[1:18:09] which is the feast of tabernacles now
[1:18:11] notice here in the 36th verse
[1:18:15] seven days shall you offer an offer made
[1:18:17] by firing to the lord he's reading the
[1:18:18] bible
[1:18:18] on the eighth day on the eighth day
[1:18:20] shall be a holy convocation
[1:18:22] there is another holy time coming amen
[1:18:27] holy convocation unto you
[1:18:31] now not to the nation to you and you
[1:18:33] shall offer an offer made by fire unto
[1:18:35] the lord is a solemn assembly and you
[1:18:37] shall do no servile work therein
[1:18:39] brother brown now says now we've got an
[1:18:41] eighth day
[1:18:44] now there's only seven days but here we
[1:18:46] speak of the eighth day holy convocation
[1:18:48] convocation notice do no work in it
[1:18:52] the eighth day or what back to the first
[1:18:55] day
[1:18:56] why it speaks of eternity and she rolls
[1:18:59] around without a stopping place amen do
[1:19:01] you see it congregation says amen
[1:19:04] because remember you're only staying
[1:19:05] there seven days you're only required to
[1:19:08] stay in this for seven church ages
[1:19:12] because after the church age is over
[1:19:14] there's some kind of change going to
[1:19:16] happen
[1:19:17] you're not in a booth made of sticks and
[1:19:19] bowels and
[1:19:20] no it's your booth it's your
[1:19:23] eternal body
[1:19:27] notice it was also upon this eighth day
[1:19:31] last day feast day of the tabernacle
[1:19:34] notice
[1:19:35] after that after the last feast day
[1:19:39] after the last church age after the last
[1:19:42] complete seven days upon earth look
[1:19:45] after the millennium so the millennium
[1:19:49] is still under the
[1:19:50] seventh day
[1:19:53] and you say well
[1:19:56] you're we're going to be eternal so as
[1:19:58] israel somebody is not going to be
[1:20:00] eternal now
[1:20:01] that's a whole nother game for us to
[1:20:03] talk about because
[1:20:04] somebody's got to live a thousand years
[1:20:07] but
[1:20:08] i want you to watch when i read another
[1:20:09] scripture here we'll look at something
[1:20:11] and see it
[1:20:12] all right after the last complete seven
[1:20:14] days upon the earth after the millennium
[1:20:16] that this holy convocation comes because
[1:20:18] listen
[1:20:19] everything doesn't go in the eighth day
[1:20:20] until the future home comes down to the
[1:20:22] earth
[1:20:23] then everything's eternal because
[1:20:24] remember in the millennium you still got
[1:20:27] fifth seal jew you've got
[1:20:30] um you've got the um foolish virgin
[1:20:33] that's dead somewhere waiting you've got
[1:20:35] the dead
[1:20:36] center dead all that you've still got
[1:20:40] there so that can't be an eight
[1:20:42] got to stay in a seven everybody got
[1:20:46] that you got to stay in that
[1:20:47] 7 7 7 7 7 7 all right
[1:20:52] but now you and i are going to be in the
[1:20:53] eighth day body spirit and soul
[1:20:56] during the millennium the the two
[1:20:58] witnesses and the 144 thousand
[1:21:00] obviously are going to be because they
[1:21:02] take a rapture they're going to come
[1:21:03] back in eternal bodies
[1:21:07] now watch what he's talking about but in
[1:21:08] the new earth he has already went and
[1:21:11] prepared the place
[1:21:12] it's built we have nothing to do with
[1:21:15] the building of it
[1:21:17] he's talking about the eighth day
[1:21:18] remember the holy convocation don't do
[1:21:19] anything
[1:21:20] amen eternal lord just love that word a
[1:21:22] holy convocation the eighth day which is
[1:21:24] only seven days
[1:21:25] then on the eighth day which comes back
[1:21:27] to the first day again
[1:21:29] comes right back to the first day the
[1:21:30] eighth day of the holy convo
[1:21:32] convocation notice seven days
[1:21:36] only has to do with the old creation
[1:21:39] world
[1:21:40] time seven days that's the millennium
[1:21:44] the rest day
[1:21:45] as god labored six days rested the
[1:21:47] seventh the church labored six days
[1:21:49] and rest the seventh but you're still in
[1:21:52] the time element
[1:21:53] i ain't speaking of the eternal he's
[1:21:54] talking about the millennium
[1:21:56] but you see there's no such a thing as
[1:21:58] eight days you go back to the first day
[1:22:01] again see
[1:22:02] the first day the sabbath speaks of the
[1:22:05] old law
[1:22:05] which was to pass away the keeping of a
[1:22:08] sabbath which
[1:22:09] passed away or i've said changed to
[1:22:12] another
[1:22:13] it didn't pass away it's about getting a
[1:22:15] new heaven and new earth because it
[1:22:16] doesn't
[1:22:17] annihilate them it just changes them all
[1:22:19] right that's the same way with me and
[1:22:21] you
[1:22:21] he didn't annihilate your body and put
[1:22:23] you in a new one when you got the new
[1:22:24] birth no he just changed the one you got
[1:22:26] right and he's going to literally change
[1:22:28] it in this church age
[1:22:30] it just changed from the old law of
[1:22:32] keeping a certain day of the week now
[1:22:33] let's go to number two
[1:22:36] so old man and old woman don't be
[1:22:39] discouraged
[1:22:42] if you are a representation up here he's
[1:22:44] talking about the blackboard he drew the
[1:22:46] representation
[1:22:47] in this attribute of god this
[1:22:50] god if you have it if you're represented
[1:22:53] here you cannot you're
[1:22:55] in the eternal and if you've crossed
[1:22:58] from that seventh day into the eighth
[1:23:00] you got into the eternal by the baptism
[1:23:02] of the holy ghost
[1:23:04] so that's what i said we're already in
[1:23:06] our future home
[1:23:08] this is our future home amen
[1:23:11] that's right this is it remember john
[1:23:14] saw it as a bride what a bride
[1:23:17] coming down out of heaven as a bride
[1:23:19] adorned for a husband he saw a city and
[1:23:20] saw a bride
[1:23:23] now if you're just trusting upon a
[1:23:24] sensation
[1:23:26] or jumping up and down or i do this i
[1:23:30] keep my seventh day i don't eat meat
[1:23:32] and things like that that's going to
[1:23:33] perish anyhow
[1:23:35] but this is the eternal this is the
[1:23:37] eternal the feast
[1:23:38] after the feast of tabernacles the feast
[1:23:41] of tabernacles was the last feast the
[1:23:44] seventh
[1:23:44] feast we are worshiping now under the
[1:23:47] feast of
[1:23:48] tabernacles the seventh church age which
[1:23:50] is exactly right
[1:23:51] but if you're born again you've already
[1:23:53] entered into the eighth day
[1:23:55] spiritually in the millennium will be
[1:23:57] under the feast of tabernacles again
[1:23:59] because remember
[1:24:00] he goes on later and quotes a scripture
[1:24:02] that the bible says they'll build houses
[1:24:04] and they'll inhabit
[1:24:05] you and i are not going to do that we're
[1:24:08] in the building we need to be in
[1:24:10] and our future home's coming a thousand
[1:24:12] years later
[1:24:13] but then after the seventh day we have a
[1:24:15] holy convocation
[1:24:17] go back into the eternal
[1:24:20] we come from eternity folks and we're
[1:24:22] going right back to eternity we just
[1:24:23] picked up a flesh body
[1:24:24] for redemption to bring it right back up
[1:24:26] to where it's supposed to be by the
[1:24:28] eternal one that came and redeemed us
[1:24:29] and taken
[1:24:30] us back letting us recognize
[1:24:33] that we're a part of this we're a part
[1:24:36] of this let us recognize
[1:24:38] we are a part of this i'm gonna read
[1:24:41] this one
[1:24:43] do you know that that in the book of
[1:24:45] acts and philip
[1:24:46] read zechariah put this up but in the
[1:24:48] book of acts in the book of philip
[1:24:50] philippians when were when were males
[1:24:53] circumcised
[1:24:56] ah on the eighth day when were you
[1:24:59] circumcised
[1:25:01] on the eighth day natural types of
[1:25:04] spiritual acts seven verses he gave him
[1:25:06] the covenant of circumcision so abraham
[1:25:08] begot isaac
[1:25:09] isaac circumcised and circumcised him on
[1:25:11] the eighth day
[1:25:13] in philippians paul says circumcised
[1:25:17] the eighth day of the stock of israel
[1:25:21] of the tribal benjamin he was literally
[1:25:23] physically circumcised on the eighth day
[1:25:25] but when he got the new birth it made
[1:25:27] him spiritually
[1:25:28] circumcised on what on his eighth day
[1:25:30] all right let's go to zechariah real
[1:25:32] quick i want you to get this
[1:25:34] because this will explain a little bit
[1:25:35] go back brother joseph there you go
[1:25:37] now this is zechariah 14 and it shall
[1:25:39] come to pass now look
[1:25:43] this is the millennium
[1:25:46] because watch what happened and it shall
[1:25:48] come to pass
[1:25:49] that every one that is left of all the
[1:25:52] nations which came
[1:25:54] against jerusalem shall even go up from
[1:25:57] year to year to worship the
[1:26:01] king
[1:26:04] the lord capital
[1:26:08] of hosts and to keep the feast of
[1:26:10] tabernacles
[1:26:12] it's going to be required in the
[1:26:13] millennium that they keep the feast of
[1:26:15] tabernacles
[1:26:16] because watch and it shall be that whoso
[1:26:19] will not come of all the families of the
[1:26:21] earth
[1:26:22] unto jerusalem to worship the king the
[1:26:24] lord of hosts
[1:26:25] even upon them shall be no reign
[1:26:28] brother brown talks about a heathen
[1:26:29] being raised up in the millennium
[1:26:31] and thus preaching the gospel to them
[1:26:33] now that's for a whole new thought but
[1:26:35] right here in the bible watch and if the
[1:26:38] family of egypt go not up and come not
[1:26:40] they'll have no rain there shall be the
[1:26:43] plague
[1:26:44] so plague remember millennium is in time
[1:26:47] to everybody but us in 144 000. right
[1:26:51] right right
[1:26:54] right it's not going to bother us
[1:26:57] but if they're going to build houses and
[1:26:59] inhabit
[1:27:00] there's got to be a world going on out
[1:27:02] there somewhere
[1:27:04] there shall be the plague where the lord
[1:27:06] will smite the heathen
[1:27:08] that come not up to keep the feast of
[1:27:11] tabernacles
[1:27:12] this shall be the punishment of egypt
[1:27:14] what talk about the world
[1:27:15] and the punishment of all nations that
[1:27:17] come not up to keep the feast
[1:27:19] of tabernacles remember the bible says
[1:27:21] he will rule
[1:27:23] with a rod of iron
[1:27:27] in the millennium something to think
[1:27:30] about
[1:27:31] it'll be a joyous time for us folks
[1:27:33] it'll be a joyous time for 144 thousand
[1:27:35] but there's going to be a world out
[1:27:36] there that things may be going on i'm
[1:27:38] telling you it's not eternal
[1:27:41] it's not an eternal place
[1:27:44] but it's a millennium that me and you
[1:27:46] get to rest
[1:27:48] and what if we have to walk out one day
[1:27:49] and go wind
[1:27:51] quit that aren't we back to the atom
[1:27:55] condition again
[1:27:56] see we're not gonna need that in the
[1:27:57] future home we're not gonna need
[1:27:59] adjustments in the future home
[1:28:03] amen it's perfect already done the
[1:28:06] prophet said come on
[1:28:07] musician the brother brown said it's
[1:28:09] already done
[1:28:11] it's set we're not going to need to move
[1:28:14] an avenue
[1:28:17] or make our pond bigger but now in the
[1:28:20] millennium
[1:28:22] food for thought the world is still in
[1:28:24] time
[1:28:25] and this in zechariah you'll continue
[1:28:26] reading zechariah 14
[1:28:28] in different places that tells about
[1:28:30] israel
[1:28:31] being in the millennium the heathen in
[1:28:34] the millennium but just remember
[1:28:38] this is the last harvest
[1:28:41] before everything that goes dead
[1:28:45] the world will be in their winter time
[1:28:48] when we leave this place
[1:28:50] everything will be dead i'm talking
[1:28:52] about physically
[1:28:54] when we leave this earth there's only
[1:28:55] going to be 144 000 and two witnesses
[1:28:58] that have
[1:28:58] any kind of life in them
[1:29:01] let's stand to our feet everything else
[1:29:04] will
[1:29:05] die everything will be
[1:29:08] dead because we know that that this
[1:29:13] battle that we're talking about there in
[1:29:14] the in the tribulation
[1:29:17] and all is going to be a physical battle
[1:29:20] an atomic battle it's not going to be
[1:29:23] god's battle is the battle of gog and
[1:29:24] magog before the future home
[1:29:27] but before but before the millennium
[1:29:28] begins there's a battle
[1:29:31] the battle of armageddon that's been
[1:29:34] told in the bible is going to happen but
[1:29:35] you know what you and i
[1:29:38] listen if you're already in your eighth
[1:29:40] day right now
[1:29:41] you do not what i said the great
[1:29:43] revelation
[1:29:45] the great revelation is that god sent us
[1:29:48] a prophet

[1:29:51] that amen
