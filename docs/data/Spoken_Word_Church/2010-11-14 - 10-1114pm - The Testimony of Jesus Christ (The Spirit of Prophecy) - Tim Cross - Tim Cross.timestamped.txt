[27:28] we're looking forward to good time in
[27:30] the Lord again tonight so just Worship
[27:32] the Lord with us just for a few moments

[28:40] things my God's been good to
[28:47] me I have family and
[28:51] friends who share it all I
[28:56] do
[29:00] but if I lose it
[29:04] all and I am left with
[29:12] nothing if I have the Lord then I know
[29:19] I'm going to make
[29:26] it because he's the only reason I
[29:32] live and don't a
[29:40] Reus he's the only reason I live and oh
[29:48] what a
[29:53] reason there is nothing in this world

[30:05] longing for more he's the only reason I
[30:11] live and oh what a
[30:26] re

[30:56] found
[30:59] until you find the Lord in the power of
[31:06] His holy
[31:10] spirit oh heal be your reason to live
[31:16] and I'll Never Never Let You

[37:29] blessings humbly in the precious name of
[37:31] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[37:35] amen Revelations
[37:37] 19 getting at verse 7 let us be glad and
[37:41] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[37:45] marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[37:48] wife hath made herself ready and to her
[37:52] was granted that she should be arrayed
[37:55] in fine linen clean and white for the
[37:59] fine linen is the righteousness of
[38:03] saints and he said unto me write blessed
[38:08] are they which are called unto the
[38:11] marriage supper of the lamb and he saith
[38:13] unto me these are the true sayings of
[38:16] God now we realize this was someone who
[38:20] was here instructing John in these
[38:24] things amen I believe it was angel I
[38:27] believe it was a
[38:28] messenger and here in verse 10 the Bible
[38:31] says John
[38:32] writes and I fell at his feet to worship
[38:38] him and he said unto me see thou do it
[38:44] not I am thy fellow
[38:47] servant and of thy Brethren that have
[38:52] the testimony of
[38:55] Jesus worship God for the testimony of
[39:00] Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy amen may
[39:05] the Lord add His blessings to the
[39:07] reading of his word and you can be
[39:09] seated I want to take for a thought
[39:11] tonight the testimony of Jesus
[39:15] Christ and the spirit of Prophecy and by
[39:20] looking very closely and very carefully
[39:23] at verse 10 and with the realization as
[39:27] we have been taught by the prophet of
[39:29] God in this hour that John the Revelator
[39:32] here St John the
[39:34] Divine was a type of the Bride of Jesus
[39:37] Christ you believe that tonight and so
[39:40] John was so perhaps he was so caught up
[39:44] he was so enthralled he was so uh so
[39:49] blessed and so um enthused in the things
[39:54] that had just been revealed to to him
[39:57] that he found
[39:59] himself with a tendency or with a desire
[40:03] to want to fall at the feet of the man
[40:07] who had introduced these truths to him
[40:10] to worship him now if you if you think
[40:13] about this for a moment and you you
[40:15] realize this in the light of the fact
[40:18] that John was one of Jesus disciples
[40:23] this was not John the Baptist who was
[40:25] beheaded
[40:27] before Jesus was even crucified and
[40:29] resurrected but this is St John the
[40:31] Divine who was one of the elected
[40:34] disciples that Christ had handpicked he
[40:37] had lived with Jesus he had walked with
[40:40] Jesus he had slept he had eaten with him
[40:43] he traveled in his ministry and all
[40:45] these things he had seen the person of
[40:49] Jesus Christ God manifested In the Flesh
[40:53] amen perhaps even with a greater
[40:56] Revelation and a greater realization of
[40:59] who Jesus Christ was than other
[41:02] disciples now I want I want to establish
[41:05] that in our minds and in our hearts this
[41:07] evening John knew who Jesus was John
[41:12] knew who Christ was John amen was with
[41:16] him when he was caught up in a cloud in
[41:18] the Holy mount on the mount
[41:20] Transfiguration there was James Peter
[41:22] and John John was there at the
[41:25] crucifixion John was there at the
[41:28] resurrection John was there at his
[41:30] Ascension back into Glory John was there
[41:33] on the day of Pentecost John was filled
[41:36] with the Holy Ghost but yet here comes a
[41:40] messenger here comes a man here comes a
[41:44] person who's born in sin shapen in
[41:47] iniquity com into the world speaking
[41:49] lies and John sees so much of the
[41:53] characteristics and the attributes and
[41:55] the life of Christ portrayed through
[41:58] this man's life and Ministry that John
[42:02] finds himself Desiring to bow at the
[42:06] feet of this man and worship Him amen
[42:10] now as a type of the Bride I believe we
[42:12] can take from this that there will be
[42:16] this tendency even within elected
[42:18] members of the Bride to want to exalt a
[42:22] man above his position amen above his
[42:27] rightful placing as a messenger but I
[42:31] believe also that uh this messenger and
[42:34] I believe with all of my heart this was
[42:36] the prophet of God the seventh angel
[42:39] messenger I believe he has a true
[42:42] Vindicated messenger and as a redeemed
[42:46] Son of God through which Christ was
[42:49] permitted and Christ was pleased to
[42:51] express himself through so much so he
[42:54] said this is not the voice of William
[42:57] Brown he has y I have yielded his his
[43:02] being I have yielded his vessel unto me
[43:05] God was pleased to dwell in that man and
[43:09] we saw the son of man Ministry there
[43:12] expressed through William Brandon but
[43:15] not to make William brandom an object of
[43:17] worship come on not to make him an idol
[43:20] not to make him an icon not to make him
[43:24] amen some type of heathenistic or Pagan
[43:27] figure by which we would find ourselves
[43:30] worshiping a man amen but it was God
[43:36] expressing the word made flesh in a
[43:40] measure and in a manner to be a sort of
[43:44] first fruits that could be waved before
[43:48] the people as a type as an indication as
[43:52] a symbol that more are out there now
[43:56] waiting to come to the same
[43:59] manifestation amen so that she can
[44:02] become the invisible image of the
[44:05] invisible God In Bright form
[44:09] amen and so this being a true Messenger
[44:12] he would not receive
[44:14] worship he would not permit John to make
[44:18] him an
[44:19] antichrist he said if you baptize in my
[44:22] name you make me an antichrist right he
[44:26] would not permit John to lose his
[44:29] balance in his worship but he said see
[44:31] thou do it
[44:33] not I am thy fellow servant and of thy
[44:37] Brethren brother R said if you love me
[44:40] call me
[44:43] brother I don't know what all of you
[44:46] believe I don't know what backgrounds
[44:47] you come from but you know there
[44:50] are there are those that try to deify
[44:53] William bream try to make him some form
[44:56] of idol or object of
[44:59] worship brother bam
[45:01] himself came off of the field because of
[45:05] that going on Amen right he said I'm thy
[45:09] fellow servant and of thy
[45:11] Brethren but he said I have something I
[45:14] possess something I have the testimony
[45:18] of
[45:19] Jesus worship
[45:23] God he directed the work worship toward
[45:27] God he channeled the worship toward God
[45:31] he encouraged any worship that might
[45:34] have somehow come in his Direction he
[45:36] pushed that away and said worship God
[45:41] Amen and then he says for the testimony
[45:44] of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy so he
[45:49] showing I have this testimony of Jesus
[45:52] Christ but not only I I'm just your
[45:54] fellow servant I'm just your brother
[45:57] showing he was placing himself on the
[46:00] same level with his peers or with his
[46:04] brothers and sisters within the body of
[46:07] Jesus Christ right it is only such that
[46:10] the timing has come now for Christ to
[46:13] make himself known and revealed and
[46:17] expressed in a many membered body called
[46:22] The Bride of Jesus Christ amen and now
[46:24] brother and sister this body has been
[46:26] formed she's been assembled she has been
[46:30] gathered throughout seven Church ages
[46:33] beginning with the day of Pentecost
[46:35] beginning with the New Testament Church
[46:37] under a Grace Covenant through all of
[46:39] those Messengers and through all of
[46:41] those attacks of Satan upon the word yet
[46:45] Christ has determined I will have a
[46:48] bride I will have a people that are
[46:51] called by my name who I have raised up
[46:54] whom I have selected whom I have charged
[46:57] and empowered to be my living
[47:01] Witnesses upon the Earth god brother B
[47:04] said will not be without a witness God
[47:07] will never leave himself without a
[47:10] witness upon the Earth
[47:11] right hallelujah hallelujah am so the
[47:15] things we see when we look now let's
[47:17] just turn very quickly to Revelations
[47:19] chapter
[47:20] 13 and let's look at another
[47:24] church and another group of
[47:26] people who also have a messenger who
[47:31] also have a person who is a revealer of
[47:36] the word to them but in in in all truth
[47:39] and honesty he's a perverter of the word
[47:42] amen and here in Revelations 13 we begin
[47:45] reading in verse 5 and there was given
[47:48] unto him a mouth that's a voice there
[47:52] was given unto him a mouth speaking
[47:55] great things and blasphemies and power
[47:59] was given unto him to continue 40 and
[48:01] two months and he opened his mouth in
[48:04] blasphemy against God to blaspheme his
[48:08] name what did he turn in his he turned
[48:10] his name into titles right right to
[48:13] blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle
[48:18] who is the Tabernacle of God in this
[48:20] hour you and I what did he tell Saul on
[48:23] the road to Damascus Saul Saul why
[48:25] persecutest thou me amen Saul had never
[48:30] perhaps even met Jesus Christ in a flesh
[48:32] body but when Saul was persecuting that
[48:36] redeemed Church filled with the Holy
[48:38] Ghost Jesus said that's me that's my
[48:42] many membered body on the face of the
[48:44] Earth and when you talk about them when
[48:47] you persecute them when you try them and
[48:49] all these things in Tribulation that's
[48:52] me that you're doing that too amen how
[48:54] about it friend that's right how about
[48:57] the way brother B said we serve God as
[48:59] we serve one another we love God as we
[49:02] love one another it might be surprising
[49:05] to us someday to find out Amen in so
[49:08] much as you have done into the least of
[49:10] these my little ones you've done it unto
[49:12] me his
[49:15] Tabernacle blasphemed his name and his
[49:17] Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven
[49:20] watch this and it was given unto him to
[49:22] make war with the Saints and to overcome
[49:26] them and power was given him over all
[49:28] kindreds and tongues and
[49:30] Nations watch verse 8 and all that dwell
[49:33] upon the Earth shall worship
[49:37] him they are worshiping a
[49:39] man they are worshiping a figure amen
[49:44] they shall worship Him whose names are
[49:47] not written in the Book of Life of the
[49:50] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[49:53] world what a contrast here's a a church
[49:56] who's worshiping a man Revelations 13
[49:59] they're worshiping an antichrist system
[50:02] which has taken formed now in the in in
[50:05] Catholicism and will be headed up in a
[50:07] figurehead called the pope he will be
[50:10] the Antichrist he will come fully
[50:12] incarnated as the bride is being taken
[50:14] from the earth they're worshiping a man
[50:17] and they'll turn right around and call
[50:18] us
[50:19] bramit manf followers and man
[50:22] worshippers what they fail to real iiz
[50:26] is that God has veiled himself in a body
[50:30] of human flesh amen and we're not
[50:32] worshiping amen the son of Charles and
[50:35] El Bram but we're worshiping The God Who
[50:38] was pleased to dwell within that body
[50:42] right with the realization that the same
[50:45] God who had manifested and expressed
[50:48] himself through a carnal born son of
[50:52] Charles and ell Brown the same God
[50:54] desires to accomplish the same purpose
[50:58] through a bride who has received that
[51:01] message Hallelujah that God brought
[51:04] through that Prophet come on am call me
[51:06] a man follower call me a man worshiper I
[51:09] don't care I know by Revelation amen
[51:13] what the church is built on is the
[51:15] revelation of Jesus Christ that's right
[51:19] not Peter but Christ in Peter right
[51:23] amen oh I feel like preaching now amen
[51:27] you can never have a realization the
[51:29] revelation of who you are until you have
[51:31] a revelation of who Christ is when Peter
[51:35] called a revelation that Jesus was not a
[51:38] second person he was the person he was
[51:42] Emmanuel he was Elohim he was je Jehovah
[51:46] of the Old Testament he Jesus of the new
[51:49] and Jesus said and thou are Peter now
[51:52] that you have recognized my spiritual
[51:54] Revelation who who I am now Jesus can
[51:57] begin placing Peter right placing Peter
[52:00] as a stone in the great building right
[52:04] oh praise the lord well God I've got to
[52:07] get into my
[52:08] message let's look at something tonight
[52:10] turn with me to Jeremiah chapter 27 how
[52:14] many knows what Jeremiah
[52:16] Was he was a prophet
[52:19] right everybody know Jeremiah was a
[52:22] prophet of course we don't believe in
[52:24] prophets nowadays do
[52:26] modern day Church world the secular
[52:28] church has a resistance to prophets but
[52:32] God uses prophets
[52:34] amen I'm I'm told by men who study these
[52:37] things that the reason the Jews fail to
[52:41] realize the Messiah is because they had
[52:43] rejected all the prophets no they' slain
[52:46] them all they' killed them all of course
[52:48] they went then why did their suppers at
[52:50] all these things Jesus said you you you
[52:53] worship the prophets but your father
[52:55] others is the ones that put them there
[52:57] right because they refused the prophets
[52:59] they failed to see the Messiah right
[53:02] even Jesus own disciples come down from
[53:04] the Mount of transfiguration said why
[53:06] then do the scribes say that Elias must
[53:08] first come they didn't even know who
[53:10] Elias was right Jesus said Elias shall
[53:13] truly first come to restore all things
[53:15] but I tell you that he's already come
[53:17] and they did with him what they listed
[53:19] if you don't see the ministry of the
[53:21] prophets you'll never see who he came to
[53:23] introduce right if you don't catch the
[53:26] revelation of the Forerunner how are you
[53:27] going to catch the royalty that the
[53:30] Forerunner come to introduce to you and
[53:32] I so thank God if you've got a
[53:34] revelation I heard a brother talking the
[53:35] other day uh said you know I was in the
[53:38] Baptist Church and I was looking for
[53:39] Elijah to come he said I had no idea why
[53:42] but he said I knew God was going to send
[53:45] Elijah so finally some one day somebody
[53:47] told him hey brother Malachi 4 and
[53:50] Revelation 10:7 Elijah has comeing this
[53:53] hour he went the with a seed of
[53:56] predestination down in his heart for no
[54:00] understandable reason was looking for
[54:02] Elijah why you must receive the ministry
[54:05] of the Forerunner before you can be
[54:08] introduced to the person of Jesus Christ
[54:12] amen it's
[54:16] wonderful Jeremiah chapter
[54:22] 27 beginning at verse one
[54:29] in the beginning of the reign of
[54:31] jeam the son of Josiah king of Judah
[54:34] came this word unto Jeremiah from the
[54:38] Lord
[54:39] saying thus sayth the Lord to me make
[54:43] thee bonds and
[54:45] yolks and put them upon thy
[54:49] neck and send them to the king of Edom
[54:52] and to the king of Moab and to the king
[54:54] of the ammonites to the king of Tyrus
[54:57] and to the king of zidon by the hand of
[54:59] The Messengers which come to Jerusalem
[55:02] unto zedekiah king of Judah and command
[55:05] them to say unto their masters thus
[55:08] saith the Lord God of the Lord of hosts
[55:10] the god of Israel thus shall you say
[55:13] unto your
[55:14] Masters verse five I have made the
[55:17] Earth the man and the Beast that are
[55:20] upon the ground by my great power and by
[55:23] my outstretched arm and have given it
[55:26] unto whom it seemed meat unto
[55:29] me and now have I given all these lands
[55:32] into the hand of
[55:34] Nebuchadnezzar the king of
[55:37] Babylon my
[55:39] servant and the beasts of the field have
[55:43] I given him also to serve
[55:47] him bet this Mage didn't make Jeremiah
[55:50] too
[55:52] popular God has has given these Kings
[55:57] that's right Their Kingdoms their beasts
[56:00] their cattle their peoples their lands
[56:02] into the hand of a Babylonian King neuch
[56:05] that's right I tell you one thing think
[56:07] about it being a prophet is not always a
[56:10] highly saw after
[56:12] position
[56:13] amen and being a follower of his message
[56:17] is not always a prestigious thing
[56:19] either verse 7 All Nations Shall Serve
[56:23] him and his son and his son's son until
[56:28] the very time of his land come and then
[56:31] many nations and great Kings Shall Serve
[56:33] themselves of him it shall come to pass
[56:36] that the nation and Kingdom which will
[56:38] not serve the same nebuchad or the king
[56:41] of Babylon and that will not put their
[56:44] neck under the Yoke of the king of
[56:47] Babylon that Nation will I punish sayeth
[56:50] the Lord with the sword and with the
[56:53] famine and with with the pestilence
[56:56] until I have consumed them by his
[57:00] hand therefore hearken not ye to your
[57:03] prophets nor to your diviners nor to
[57:07] your dreamers nor to your enchanters nor
[57:11] to your Sorcerers which speak unto you
[57:14] saying ye shall not serve the king of
[57:16] Babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you
[57:20] to remove you far from your land and
[57:24] that I should drive you out and ye
[57:27] should perish but the Nations that bring
[57:30] their neck under the Yoke of the king of
[57:32] babyon and serve him those will I let
[57:36] remain still in their own land sayeth
[57:39] the Lord and they shall till it and
[57:41] dwell
[57:43] therein verse 12 I spake also to
[57:46] zedekiah King of Judah according to all
[57:47] these words saying bring your necks
[57:49] under the Yol of the king of Babylon and
[57:51] serve him and his people and live why
[57:54] will will you die thou and thy people by
[57:57] the sword by the famine by the
[57:58] pestilence as the Lord has spoken
[58:00] against the nation that will not serve
[58:02] the king of Babylon therefore hearken
[58:05] not unto the words of the prophets that
[58:07] speak unto you saying ye shall not serve
[58:09] the king of Babylon for they prophesy a
[58:12] lie unto you for I have not sent them
[58:15] sayeth the Lord yet they prophesy a lie
[58:17] in my name that I might drive you out
[58:20] and that you might perish ye and the
[58:23] prophets that prophesy unto you
[58:27] also I spake to the priest and to all
[58:31] this people saying thus sayith the Lord
[58:33] hearken not to the words of your
[58:35] prophets that prophesy unto you saying
[58:37] behold the vessels of the Lord's House
[58:39] shall now shortly be brought again from
[58:41] Babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you
[58:45] hearken not unto them serve the king of
[58:48] Babylon and live wherefore should this
[58:52] city be laid waste but if they be
[58:55] prophets and if the word of the Lord be
[58:57] with them let them now make intercession
[59:00] to the Lord of hosts that the vessels
[59:02] which are left in the house of the Lord
[59:04] and in the king in the house of the king
[59:07] of Judah and at Jerusalem go not to
[59:09] Babylon for thus saith the Lord of host
[59:11] concerning the pillars and concerning
[59:13] the sea and concerning the bases and
[59:15] concerning the residue of the vessels
[59:17] that remain in this city which
[59:19] Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon took not
[59:21] when he carried away captive Janiah the
[59:23] son of jeho king of Judah from Jerusalem
[59:26] to Babylon and all the Nobles of Judah
[59:29] and Jerusalem yay thus sayth the Lord of
[59:32] host the god of Israel concerning the
[59:35] vessels that remain in the house of the
[59:37] Lord and in the house of the king of
[59:40] Judah and Jerusalem they shall be
[59:42] carried to Babylon and there shall they
[59:45] be until the day that I visit them
[59:47] sayith the Lord then will I bring them
[59:49] up and restore them to this place quite
[59:52] a message amen
[59:55] quite a message to Israel but if you
[59:57] will study back into Deuteronomy you'll
[59:59] find out this is exactly what God
[1:00:02] predicted would happen to them if they
[1:00:06] did not follow his
[1:00:09] precepts right his
[1:00:11] Commandments and his ordained way for
[1:00:14] them to stay under the Covenant of
[1:00:16] blessing in the land the promised land
[1:00:19] he said if you hearken not if you
[1:00:22] deviate if you go and back to to your
[1:00:24] Idols back to your Gods I will
[1:00:28] permit the surrounding countries to take
[1:00:30] you captive and to come in and to to to
[1:00:34] wreak all this Havoc upon your land and
[1:00:36] your Worship in the temple and all these
[1:00:39] different things so Jeremiah's prophecy
[1:00:41] is perfectly in line with what Moses
[1:00:44] told them in the book of
[1:00:46] Deuteronomy although I'm certain this
[1:00:49] did not help Jeremiah's
[1:00:52] ratings amongst the children of Israel
[1:00:55] amen I'm sure this was not an easy
[1:00:57] message for him to preach I'm sure this
[1:00:59] was not an easy message for them to
[1:01:02] receive and it was very evident by the
[1:01:04] just the nature of the prophecy that was
[1:01:06] given that there were other prophets
[1:01:09] there were other Ministries that were
[1:01:10] highly esteemed and your prophets your
[1:01:13] Chatters your divers your Sorcerers all
[1:01:16] these people had multiple
[1:01:19] sources of Revelation but there was only
[1:01:22] one provided way for God to speak to
[1:01:25] them and he said disregard everything
[1:01:28] they say that comes contrary to this
[1:01:31] message amen I believe that's good
[1:01:33] advice for us today we have a
[1:01:35] responsibility as Sons and Daughters of
[1:01:38] God to compare everything that comes
[1:01:40] across our ears to the prophet's message
[1:01:43] and we not the ministry we will be held
[1:01:46] accountable for how we judge that and
[1:01:50] hold that standard of the message in
[1:01:52] place amen it is it is incumbent upon us
[1:01:56] to take what is preached to us and
[1:01:58] compare it to God's word amen I'm not
[1:02:01] saying that because I think brother
[1:02:03] Samuel or brother Wade are getting up
[1:02:05] here preaching something you understand
[1:02:07] I think they tell you the same thing
[1:02:09] take everything that's preached judge it
[1:02:12] by the Yan Thum judge it by the word of
[1:02:15] God take every notion take every idea
[1:02:18] that comes to you whether by inspiration
[1:02:20] or anointing in prayer whatever it may
[1:02:22] be Everything Must Go back to the
[1:02:25] standard which is the word of God okay
[1:02:28] but now Jeremiah comes and he gives this
[1:02:30] he gives this Doom and Gloom prophecy
[1:02:33] and so the Bible comes over here and
[1:02:35] I'll try to to I know it gets old
[1:02:38] sometimes or tiome tiresome hearing all
[1:02:41] the scriptures read but in verse in
[1:02:42] chapter 28 it continues in verse one it
[1:02:45] says and it came to pass the same year
[1:02:48] in the beginning of the reign of
[1:02:50] zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth
[1:02:52] year and in the fifth month
[1:02:55] that hananiah the son of Aer the prophet
[1:02:59] which was of gibian spake unto me in the
[1:03:02] house of the Lord in the presence of the
[1:03:04] priests and of all the people saying
[1:03:07] thus sayith the Lord God of hosts the
[1:03:09] god of Israel saying I have broken the
[1:03:13] Yoke of the king of Babylon within two
[1:03:16] full years will I bring again into this
[1:03:19] place all the vessels of the Lord's
[1:03:21] House that Nebuchadnezzar King of
[1:03:23] Babylon took away from this place and
[1:03:25] Carri them to Babylon and I will bring
[1:03:27] again to this place jeconiah the son of
[1:03:29] jeho King of Judah with all the captives
[1:03:33] of Judah that went into Babylon sayith
[1:03:35] the Lord for I will break the Yoke of
[1:03:38] the king of Babylon then the Prophet
[1:03:41] Jeremiah said unto the prophet haniah in
[1:03:44] the presence of the priest and in the
[1:03:46] presence of all the people that stood in
[1:03:48] the house of the Lord even the Prophet
[1:03:52] Jeremiah said amen
[1:03:55] amen the Lord do
[1:03:57] so the Lord perform thy Words which thou
[1:04:01] has prophesied to bring again the
[1:04:02] vessels of the Lord's house and all that
[1:04:05] is carried away captive from Babylon
[1:04:07] into this place
[1:04:08] nevertheless hear thou now this word
[1:04:11] that I speak in thine ears and in the
[1:04:14] ears of all the people the prophets that
[1:04:17] have been before me and before thee of
[1:04:20] old prophesied both against many
[1:04:24] countries and against Great kingdoms of
[1:04:26] war and of evil and of pestilence the
[1:04:29] prophet which prophesieth of Peace when
[1:04:32] the word of the Prophet shall come to
[1:04:35] pass then shall the prophet be known
[1:04:39] that the Lord ha truly s him amen now
[1:04:43] brother we've got ourselves uh raging
[1:04:48] conflict right here before the church
[1:04:51] right here before the priests right here
[1:04:53] before the people Jeremiah has raised up
[1:04:56] and prophesied captivity prophesied
[1:05:00] bondage prophesied the vessels being
[1:05:03] taken out of the temple and hananiah
[1:05:05] raises up and says hey two years and
[1:05:09] God's going to break the
[1:05:11] Yoke verse
[1:05:13] 10 then hananiah the prophet took the
[1:05:17] Yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's
[1:05:21] neck and break it
[1:05:24] he just broke the thing brother you
[1:05:27] talking about charismatics these people
[1:05:29] weren't weren't afraid to get just get
[1:05:31] act an out right there in the sanctuary
[1:05:33] you know he just broke it verse 11 and
[1:05:36] hananias spake in the presence of all
[1:05:38] the people saying thus sayith the Lord
[1:05:40] even so will I break the Yoke of
[1:05:42] Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon from the
[1:05:44] neck of all Nations within the space of
[1:05:47] two full years and the Prophet Jeremiah
[1:05:51] went his way notice he never re
[1:05:55] responded he had nothing to
[1:05:58] prove he either had the word of the Lord
[1:06:01] or he kept
[1:06:03] silent now many would view this as a
[1:06:05] personal attack of hananiah on Jeremiah
[1:06:08] but Jeremiah didn't take it personally
[1:06:10] that's right no true servant of God will
[1:06:13] ever take it
[1:06:14] personally it was God who gave him the
[1:06:17] words to speak he spoke on behalf of God
[1:06:21] hananiah was obviously speaking on
[1:06:23] behalf of another power another
[1:06:26] influence and when he broke that no that
[1:06:29] yoke off of Jeremiah's neck regardless
[1:06:31] of how humiliating regardless of how
[1:06:34] embarrassing regardless of how uh
[1:06:37] shameful that may have seemed Jeremiah
[1:06:39] simply walked
[1:06:41] away then the word of the Lord came unto
[1:06:43] Jeremiah the prophet after that hananiah
[1:06:46] the prophet had broken the Yoke from off
[1:06:48] the neck of the Prophet Jeremiah saying
[1:06:50] go and tell hananiah saying thus sayeth
[1:06:53] the Lord
[1:06:55] thou Hast broken the yolks of
[1:06:59] wood but Thou shalt make for them yolks
[1:07:03] of
[1:07:04] iron for thus saith the Lord of hosts
[1:07:08] the god of Israel I have put a yoke of
[1:07:12] iron upon the neck of all these nations
[1:07:16] that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar King
[1:07:18] of Babylon and they shall serve him and
[1:07:22] I have given him the Beast of the field
[1:07:25] also then said the Prophet Jeremiah unto
[1:07:28] haniah the prophet here now haniah the
[1:07:31] Lord hath not sent thee but thou makest
[1:07:35] this people to trust in a li therefore
[1:07:39] saeth the Lord behold I will cast thee
[1:07:41] from off the face of the Earth this year
[1:07:44] Thou shalt die because thou Hast taught
[1:07:49] Rebellion against the Lord so hananiah
[1:07:52] the prophet died the same year year in
[1:07:55] the 17th month now here's what I want to
[1:07:58] use this illustration to to show to you
[1:08:01] or to the thought that I want to convey
[1:08:04] to you this evening Jeremiah was God's
[1:08:07] Prophet to God's children
[1:08:13] Israel they could claim him as their
[1:08:16] messenger and their prophet and the
[1:08:19] mouthpiece of God or the channel through
[1:08:23] which God could convey his thoughts his
[1:08:28] will his plan for the people now
[1:08:33] Jeremiah's
[1:08:36] prophecies were one thing but in this
[1:08:40] example God instructs Jeremiah to go no
[1:08:45] doubt down to a blacksmith or down to a
[1:08:47] cobbler down to someone that could take
[1:08:50] a yoke of wood and place it around
[1:08:54] Jeremiah's neck and Jeremiah comes to
[1:08:57] church to preach his message with the
[1:08:59] Yol a wooden Yol around his
[1:09:01] neck now imagine if you were sitting
[1:09:04] here on a Sunday
[1:09:06] morning at 10:00 a.m. or 10:15 10:30
[1:09:10] 10:45 and they begin singing Open the
[1:09:13] Eyes of My Heart Lord and here comes
[1:09:15] brother Samuel Dell walking in the aisle
[1:09:17] with a big wooden
[1:09:19] yolk around this neck oh my you'd be
[1:09:22] getting on the cell phone calling your
[1:09:24] friends calling your neighbors calling
[1:09:26] the mayor oh I'm so proud of my pastor I
[1:09:30] tell you what he's really got a
[1:09:32] revelation he's really got the mind of
[1:09:34] God for this you'd be embarrassed
[1:09:36] wouldn't you huh you'd say what in the
[1:09:39] world has gotten into that brother maybe
[1:09:42] maybe you know he he the doctor
[1:09:43] prescribed him uh some dementia pills or
[1:09:46] something he forgot to take you know
[1:09:48] what I'm saying not to be disrespectful
[1:09:50] but in your mind how are you going to
[1:09:52] think if this is your prophet
[1:09:54] this is your messenger and he's coming
[1:09:57] and he's behaving himself and he's
[1:09:59] conducting himself in this manner but
[1:10:02] you see we can look back now on through
[1:10:05] time we can look back on this example
[1:10:07] and realize the life and the ministry of
[1:10:11] this prophet of God was
[1:10:14] symbolic amen it was portraying
[1:10:17] something that was not even necessarily
[1:10:20] for him it wasn't Jeremiah that had
[1:10:23] sined it wasn't Jeremiah that had ENT
[1:10:25] into idolatry it wasn't Jeremiah that
[1:10:29] was constantly backsliding and falling
[1:10:31] from Grace but his life and Ministry was
[1:10:35] portraying something that was coming on
[1:10:38] the people are you with me and hananiah
[1:10:43] being a a being a hirling prophet or
[1:10:46] being persuaded or influenced by the
[1:10:49] desires of the people he comes under an
[1:10:53] anointing and and prophesies no no no no
[1:10:55] no we're not going into bondage we're
[1:10:57] not going to have to suffer we're not
[1:10:59] going to have to come under these things
[1:11:02] that you know are are coming contrary to
[1:11:04] our desires and our wishes and our plans
[1:11:07] no it's only going to last two years and
[1:11:09] he literally goes as far as to break
[1:11:12] that Yol of wood right off of Jeremiah's
[1:11:15] neck no doubt he danced around see there
[1:11:17] that was nothing not just Jeremiah he's
[1:11:19] you know he's lost it he's cuckoo he's
[1:11:21] Loco whatever the casee may be I'm the
[1:11:24] real
[1:11:25] Prophet send your tithes to me you know
[1:11:28] uh send your love letters here send your
[1:11:31] offerings and I you know I'll tell you
[1:11:33] what you want to hear oh my friend but
[1:11:36] God had provided way and God had a plan
[1:11:41] and God was going to execute judgment
[1:11:45] upon the people so breaking that wooden
[1:11:48] Yol did nothing but increase the
[1:11:52] intensity of of the Judgment that God
[1:11:55] had determined to execute upon those
[1:11:57] people and he told Jeremiah you go back
[1:12:00] down and you get a Yol of iron and he
[1:12:02] won't break that
[1:12:04] brother he'll get a lot of knee injuries
[1:12:07] sister Dell's trying to break that
[1:12:10] yoke
[1:12:11] amen God
[1:12:13] portraying through the life of a prophet
[1:12:17] through the ministry of a prophet
[1:12:19] something that's coming on the people
[1:12:21] now just think about that with me for a
[1:12:24] moment
[1:12:26] as as unusual as that may have
[1:12:30] seemed as awkward as as
[1:12:34] strange as that may have seemed there
[1:12:38] was a
[1:12:40] special message that God was trying to
[1:12:43] convey through the unusual conduct and
[1:12:48] actions of that
[1:12:50] Prophet how many remembers a man the
[1:12:53] Bible by the name of Ezekiel God told
[1:12:55] him to lay on one side for 390 days then
[1:12:59] told him lay on the other side 40 days
[1:13:01] how proud would you have
[1:13:05] been that's my pastor that's my preacher
[1:13:09] oh the Holy Roller
[1:13:12] yeah but you see his life and Ministry
[1:13:15] was showing something coming on the
[1:13:18] people how would you like to have had
[1:13:20] Hosea for your pastor God told him to go
[1:13:24] a woman of homs right a prostitute as it
[1:13:27] were a woman of homs why not for
[1:13:30] anything Hosea had done not to show that
[1:13:33] it was acceptable or permissible or even
[1:13:36] advisable for a minister to marry a
[1:13:38] woman of this ill fame or ill repute but
[1:13:41] showing that Israel had gone into
[1:13:44] spiritual idolatry Israel had gone into
[1:13:48] spiritual homs and the life and Ministry
[1:13:51] of that Prophet was display playing that
[1:13:54] or portraying that in front of the world
[1:13:57] as well as the people are you with me
[1:14:01] now so what if we take
[1:14:06] this
[1:14:08] principle and apply it to the day that
[1:14:12] you and I live those are negative
[1:14:18] examples but let's look for a moment at
[1:14:21] Abraham and
[1:14:22] Sarah God sent them a prophet one day
[1:14:29] MDC God in this hour revealed how he
[1:14:33] accomplished that right brother said he
[1:14:35] come right down scooped up 16 elements
[1:14:38] from the earth and a handful of
[1:14:40] dust blew into that body formed himself
[1:14:43] a body then Elohim stepped into that
[1:14:48] body and he went down to the tent of
[1:14:52] Abraham and S Etc and delivered a
[1:14:54] message to them I will visit you
[1:14:58] according to the time of life amen is
[1:15:02] God
[1:15:03] able is there anything God can't do
[1:15:06] Sarah laughing in the tentor oh but if
[1:15:09] they could have only had a revelation if
[1:15:12] God can take 16 elements of a sin cursed
[1:15:16] Earth form himself a body step into it
[1:15:19] walk down here and deliver this message
[1:15:21] can God take our body IES and transform
[1:15:24] them back to young man and young woman
[1:15:27] again and not only that but then give us
[1:15:29] the ability to do something that even at
[1:15:32] that age we were unable to do God
[1:15:35] showing through the life and Ministry
[1:15:38] and the conduct of mezc that the promis
[1:15:42] the time is nigh now the time has
[1:15:44] arrived for the manifestation of the
[1:15:48] promised word that's right God said it
[1:15:51] amen God was building their faith God
[1:15:54] was conditioning their faith to accept
[1:15:56] his promised word but now MDC comes on
[1:16:00] the scene in a body of Flesh and says
[1:16:02] your faith has reached the level now
[1:16:05] where you can receive this ministry that
[1:16:07] will enact and make manifest and
[1:16:11] materialize a promise regarding you
[1:16:14] right Hallelujah God knew exactly where
[1:16:17] Abraham and Sarah lived he knew they
[1:16:19] lived in a tent he knew their address he
[1:16:22] knew knew everything about him amen he
[1:16:25] never had to Google it he never had to
[1:16:27] go down to the post office he never had
[1:16:30] to go look at the wanted posters amen he
[1:16:33] knew exactly where on his created Earth
[1:16:36] that son and daughter
[1:16:37] lived oh and God has visited Us in this
[1:16:40] generation turned it back to the
[1:16:42] audience you sister called her name told
[1:16:46] her her address Oh my he got it wrong no
[1:16:50] she just moved amen hell him knows where
[1:16:54] you live God knows your situation God
[1:16:58] knows your life circumstance God hears
[1:17:01] every prayer that you offer up to his
[1:17:04] throne of grace and mercy amen amen and
[1:17:07] he's come to reveal himself to you right
[1:17:11] as a very personal and compassionate and
[1:17:14] caring God that's right it's God's
[1:17:17] promise about you right that will bring
[1:17:19] him on the scene to make that promise
[1:17:21] manifest amen than you Lord I think of
[1:17:24] Moses oh my Moses went up there on the
[1:17:27] holy Mount was enveloped in a cloud
[1:17:31] Joshua was somewhere up there on the you
[1:17:32] know partially the way up the mountain
[1:17:36] and there stood those people around the
[1:17:37] base of the
[1:17:38] mountain trembling and quaking for fear
[1:17:42] but oh they were adoring
[1:17:45] Moses praise God that's our man that's
[1:17:50] our Prophet that's right that's our
[1:17:52] mighty deliver and now he's done got
[1:17:54] caught up in the cloud and we don't have
[1:17:56] any idea what's going on up there but we
[1:17:57] know it must be something
[1:18:00] glorious and at the same
[1:18:03] time Janice and jambers that's were
[1:18:06] growing
[1:18:07] jealous he thinks he's the only Pebble
[1:18:10] on the beach he thinks he's the only
[1:18:12] bump on the pickle he thinks he's the
[1:18:15] only one through which God speaks and
[1:18:18] they get those people influenced away to
[1:18:20] build a golden
[1:18:21] calf you see what I'm saying it's such a
[1:18:25] fine line between truly recognizing that
[1:18:29] messenger and his purpose and then
[1:18:32] idolizing
[1:18:34] him into
[1:18:36] something above or apart from what God
[1:18:40] sent him to be amen right brother R said
[1:18:44] when Moses come down from that mountain
[1:18:46] he was Christ to those people right
[1:18:49] right amen right he was the word made
[1:18:54] flesh right to those people right and
[1:18:57] here's a group of them dancing around a
[1:18:59] golden calf well Moses is gone we might
[1:19:02] as well worship Aaron Moses is gone we
[1:19:04] might as well find us another icon Moses
[1:19:07] is gone we might as well find us another
[1:19:09] great preacher another great Pastor
[1:19:11] somebody to exalt somebody to lift up
[1:19:13] but don't you realize God has Moses up
[1:19:17] there for a purpose God took Moses up
[1:19:20] there so he can reveal to Moses a
[1:19:24] pattern and a plan and a predestinated
[1:19:27] will for Moses to convey back to the
[1:19:30] people right and if they can have only
[1:19:33] realize when Moses come back down from
[1:19:35] the mountain he had this great long list
[1:19:37] of instructions the Lord had give them
[1:19:40] here's how to build the Tabernacle in
[1:19:41] the wilderness here's how to build the
[1:19:43] outer Court the inner Court the holiest
[1:19:45] of holies here's how to build the veil
[1:19:47] here's how to build the altars of
[1:19:48] sacrifice here's how to build The Mercy
[1:19:50] Seat the Ark of the Covenant the table
[1:19:53] all these different things here's how to
[1:19:54] do all this Moses said God how in the
[1:19:56] world am I going to do all this he said
[1:19:57] you're
[1:19:58] not he said you're going to take this
[1:20:02] Revelation this blueprint this pattern
[1:20:06] back down to the people I imagine Moses
[1:20:07] we on the backside of the desert we
[1:20:10] ain't even got a
[1:20:11] Walmart we ain't got a Dollar General
[1:20:13] much less a Walmart where are we going
[1:20:15] to get this gold where are we going to
[1:20:18] get this wood where are we going to get
[1:20:20] this Lon and this Scarlet and all these
[1:20:23] things you know what God said it's
[1:20:25] there every bit of this material is
[1:20:27] there and Moses said well God you know I
[1:20:30] ain't a carpenter you know I'm not
[1:20:32] skilled in brass and gold and silver and
[1:20:35] in Linens and all this things God said
[1:20:37] no you're not expected to be they're
[1:20:41] gifted the gifts are in the
[1:20:44] body and they've been there the entire
[1:20:47] time and those elements are within that
[1:20:50] Earth even in that desert and they
[1:20:52] they've been there the on time but it's
[1:20:54] going to take a wisdom it's going to
[1:20:56] take a revelation it's going to take the
[1:20:58] mind of God conveyed through a message
[1:21:03] to Quicken those gifts to life and to
[1:21:05] bring those materials out of the earth
[1:21:08] and to formed them into objects of
[1:21:11] worship and objects of sacrifice and if
[1:21:14] oh if the people could have only realize
[1:21:17] if we'll take the message that has been
[1:21:20] brought to us and we'll apply it to our
[1:21:23] lives and will allow the gifts and the
[1:21:25] callings and the Ministries that God has
[1:21:28] gifted us with to take from the earth
[1:21:31] and from our everyday lives and from all
[1:21:34] the things around us once we
[1:21:39] get stay with me for a moment once
[1:21:43] we through the ministry of Moses and
[1:21:46] under his leadership and Direction get
[1:21:49] what God had in his
[1:21:51] mind
[1:21:55] materialized manifested and
[1:21:58] expressed into a literal and
[1:22:03] physical
[1:22:05] tangible Sanctuary here on Earth guess
[1:22:10] what you won't have to go to the foot of
[1:22:13] the
[1:22:13] mountain and watch and admire and adore
[1:22:18] as Moses alone gets caught up into the
[1:22:21] your kind of Glory
[1:22:24] God's whole desire God's whole purpose
[1:22:27] in bringing Moses up there was to charge
[1:22:33] him was to endow upon him this great
[1:22:37] Revelation that when Moses brought it to
[1:22:39] the people and it became materialized on
[1:22:42] the surface of the Earth that great God
[1:22:45] and His glory could
[1:22:48] descend right down past the mountain
[1:22:51] past those all those objects and come
[1:22:53] right down in that sanctuary and then
[1:22:55] have direct interaction and contact with
[1:22:58] those
[1:22:59] people to get
[1:23:01] Moses out of the picture as a central
[1:23:04] figure or as a worship figure and to say
[1:23:07] I El him desire to dwell with my
[1:23:12] people I want them to experience the
[1:23:16] same thing Moses did and what I did
[1:23:20] before them to him up here on the this
[1:23:22] mountain is an illustration or an
[1:23:25] example of what I desire to do for each
[1:23:27] and every individual one of them if
[1:23:30] they'll believe that message if they'll
[1:23:32] take the things that's been preached to
[1:23:33] them and apply it to their lives oh my
[1:23:37] brother oh my sister what in the hour
[1:23:40] that we live
[1:23:42] in look at for just very quickly the
[1:23:46] anointings there was four living
[1:23:48] creatures a lion an ox a a man and a
[1:23:53] flying
[1:23:55] eagle spiritual powers that were
[1:23:58] released through the seven Church ages
[1:24:01] to enable the elect of those ages to
[1:24:07] withstand the enemy and the power of
[1:24:11] Satan and the opposition that they would
[1:24:14] face through the Dark Ages through all
[1:24:16] of those periods those people
[1:24:18] sacrificing their lives under that Ox
[1:24:20] anointing go up and ask how do you do it
[1:24:24] why do you do it how do you explain your
[1:24:27] conduct how do you explain your actions
[1:24:30] how do you describe what you're feeling
[1:24:35] when you walk up there to a stake and
[1:24:38] you don't even need them to tie you to
[1:24:40] it and they cover your body in pitch and
[1:24:43] in tar and then light you a fire and you
[1:24:46] stand there and praise God that you
[1:24:49] could be counted worthy to die as Christ
[1:24:52] did as a mar for the cause how do you do
[1:24:54] it they would say I don't know it's not
[1:24:58] within my own power it's not within my
[1:25:01] own ability but there is an anointing
[1:25:04] there is a supernatural power of God
[1:25:08] that has been released which propels me
[1:25:11] forward which enables me to conduct
[1:25:14] myself in this way
[1:25:17] amen it's unexplainable to the world
[1:25:20] they can't Des cribe it they can't
[1:25:23] comprehend it they can't understand it
[1:25:25] but it is an anointing that has been
[1:25:28] released to Quicken the people that age
[1:25:30] to manifest their portion of the word
[1:25:33] for that
[1:25:35] age amen right look at Elisha in the
[1:25:39] school of prophets there's the prophets
[1:25:42] where's Elisha Elijah Where did Elijah
[1:25:46] go is he coming
[1:25:48] back how is he coming
[1:25:51] back is he going to fly an airplane oh
[1:25:54] is he going to build a tent come on
[1:25:56] brother is he going to set up a
[1:25:57] worldwide platform come on I tell you
[1:25:59] one thing when Elisha went back down
[1:26:00] there to Jordan River he wasn't whining
[1:26:02] and crying about where Elijah was Heen
[1:26:06] he saw beyond the bell he saw Beyond The
[1:26:10] Tabernacle he saw Beyond amen The Faults
[1:26:14] and failures and he said where is the
[1:26:17] god of Elijah because the same God the
[1:26:21] same man
[1:26:22] the same anointing has fallen upon a
[1:26:26] bride that's right that's not nervous
[1:26:29] that's not frightful that's not in a
[1:26:33] frenzy over what happened to the prophet
[1:26:35] she realizes that the prophet was sent
[1:26:39] here to display what God desired to do
[1:26:42] through the Elisha through the Believers
[1:26:45] of that message and he said I'm not
[1:26:48] ashamed to ask for double abortion
[1:26:50] because it's not to glorify me it's not
[1:26:53] to lift me up or exalt me or to double
[1:26:56] my earnings or double you know Spike My
[1:26:59] ratings it's to glorify God right praise
[1:27:03] the name of the
[1:27:04] Lord we've been anointed in this
[1:27:07] hour to believe this
[1:27:10] message I'm coming to a close
[1:27:13] here everybody say amen amen amen
[1:27:16] sometimes I get more amens when I say
[1:27:17] I'm
[1:27:21] closing I want to think I want you to
[1:27:23] think with me for a moment the
[1:27:25] restoration of the brid tree brother Reb
[1:27:27] said four death
[1:27:28] Messengers destroyed that bride tree
[1:27:32] right but he said it took four
[1:27:34] restoration four life Messengers to
[1:27:38] bring it back forth from the earth what
[1:27:41] was it bringing it back to its original
[1:27:45] condition its original
[1:27:48] state God's original plan and purpose
[1:27:52] for that brid tree so Along Comes A man
[1:27:56] raises up there in in Europe Martin
[1:27:59] Luther right Nails 90 thesis to the door
[1:28:04] of the Catholic church in Wittenberg
[1:28:08] Germany and under one portion of
[1:28:11] scripture the just shall live by faith
[1:28:15] he leads the Protestant Reformation
[1:28:19] righten anointed the man was anointed of
[1:28:24] God he was a light to that age to pierce
[1:28:29] through the darkness and say you don't
[1:28:32] have to confess your sins to the Man in
[1:28:34] the
[1:28:36] Box you don't have to pay to get your
[1:28:41] loved ones out of
[1:28:43] purgatory you don't have to pay to
[1:28:46] prepay
[1:28:47] indulgences for things that sins that
[1:28:50] you're planning to commit
[1:28:52] how ridiculous are some of these things
[1:28:55] that are enacted when the Simplicity of
[1:28:57] the word is forfeited but Luther wrotes
[1:29:00] up with Revelation the just shall live
[1:29:05] by faith and he preached a message of
[1:29:10] justification now hang with me here a
[1:29:11] minute brother and sister he preached
[1:29:14] justification is that right now I want
[1:29:16] to tell you I want to I want to just
[1:29:19] share with you this evening he didn't
[1:29:21] just preach a doct
[1:29:24] right he didn't just preach you know you
[1:29:26] just shall live by faith and you grab up
[1:29:29] Luther's uh you know message and say hey
[1:29:32] praise God the just shall live by faith
[1:29:35] I believe it I'm in no it didn't just
[1:29:40] produce a Theology of
[1:29:42] justification it didn't just produce a
[1:29:45] doctrine of justification it didn't only
[1:29:48] produce a teaching of justification but
[1:29:51] it actually produced Justified
[1:29:55] lives now there's where we're getting to
[1:29:58] right not just a Doctrine or a theology
[1:30:02] but an actual life lived right no doubt
[1:30:05] there was many people who smoked their
[1:30:07] cigars drank their beers and said I
[1:30:10] believe the doctrine of justification
[1:30:13] but there was an elected group of people
[1:30:16] who were the predestinated seed of God
[1:30:18] for that hour they heard that message of
[1:30:22] faith based on the Bible the Holy Spirit
[1:30:24] quickened it and they live a Justified
[1:30:28] life right amen are you with me along
[1:30:31] come Wesley he preached sanctification
[1:30:33] now you could say I believe the message
[1:30:36] I believe brother Wesley I love him I
[1:30:38] love his family I love you know hunting
[1:30:41] with him fishing with him horseback
[1:30:43] riding with him and all these things you
[1:30:46] with me I believe the doctrine of
[1:30:48] sanctification but if you kept on
[1:30:50] smoking your cigar
[1:30:52] and you kept on guzzling down the
[1:30:54] booze and you kept on living IM moreal
[1:30:57] life it was evident you didn't have a
[1:30:59] revelation of
[1:31:00] sanctification because sanctification is
[1:31:02] more than a belief it's more than a
[1:31:05] Doctrine but the B said we do not
[1:31:07] convert people to Christianity by its
[1:31:09] laws and by its rules it has to be a
[1:31:13] born again experience amen so the
[1:31:18] doctrine or the message of
[1:31:20] sanctification prod used Sanctified
[1:31:24] lives amongst those who was
[1:31:27] predestinated to receive that life it
[1:31:30] quickened their their hearts it
[1:31:32] quickened their souls it quickened their
[1:31:34] lives to live a Sanctified life that's
[1:31:37] right right we're going somewhere are
[1:31:39] you with
[1:31:40] me then we come down to
[1:31:42] 1906 isusa Street the day of Pentecost
[1:31:46] now it's time for another stage of
[1:31:50] restoration amen because caus the
[1:31:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:31:54] restoration of the gifts is an essential
[1:31:57] part of the four stages of restoration
[1:32:01] so here they are brother here they are
[1:32:04] sister seated down there in a barn down
[1:32:08] in isua Street California with from what
[1:32:11] I understand was a blind black preacher
[1:32:14] is that right right is that the is that
[1:32:17] the church history is that the facts he
[1:32:20] was down there preaching oh my behold in
[1:32:24] the last days sayith the Lord of hosts
[1:32:26] I'll pour out my spirit on All
[1:32:28] Flesh he began preaching not even
[1:32:31] realizing what he was doing but under an
[1:32:34] anointing that was beg to be released
[1:32:38] for that hour that old colored man may
[1:32:42] be blind in one or both eyes amen but
[1:32:45] had some spiritual Insight hav had some
[1:32:48] spiritual Revelation he begins preaching
[1:32:52] I will restore sayith the Lord I'll pour
[1:32:55] out my spirit upon All Flesh well we all
[1:32:58] know how this happened don't
[1:33:00] we we all know how this went about here
[1:33:04] they were seated in that real fine
[1:33:07] Barn no doubt they didn't have
[1:33:10] chandeliers they didn't have gold on the
[1:33:12] walls they didn't have a whole lot of
[1:33:14] you know finery to be proud of and they
[1:33:17] sat there and they
[1:33:19] snored and they snoo used and they
[1:33:22] looked at their watches and they cut
[1:33:24] their eyes at one
[1:33:26] another
[1:33:28] while the the the the man
[1:33:32] preached the
[1:33:34] restoration of the
[1:33:36] gifts and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:39] praise God I believe
[1:33:42] that I I put in my offering and I go
[1:33:46] home is that the way it happened no it
[1:33:50] didn't just produce a
[1:33:52] doctrine of the restoration of the gifts
[1:33:56] it didn't just produce a Theology of the
[1:33:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost brother
[1:34:01] something struck that
[1:34:03] place something came some Dynamics fell
[1:34:07] to strike those mechanics why because
[1:34:09] the hour had arrived right that message
[1:34:12] had been read those scriptures had been
[1:34:14] read for 2,000 years brother Aaron but
[1:34:17] now it was time for that portion of the
[1:34:20] word to be quickened and he preached the
[1:34:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost and God
[1:34:25] confirmed with signs and wonders
[1:34:27] following and out of that Barn amen out
[1:34:30] of that Barn did a Revival known as the
[1:34:33] Pentecostal Revival which set the stage
[1:34:37] and set the platform and begin Gathering
[1:34:39] the elect of that age for a message that
[1:34:43] was going to follow amen because oh
[1:34:47] Hallelujah we needed the fullness of the
[1:34:51] word restored we needed everything that
[1:34:54] had been forfeited beginning in N Rome
[1:34:57] the Grievous wolves that Paul saw coming
[1:34:59] into the church we needed all of that
[1:35:02] restored and in addition to that we
[1:35:05] needed the Thunders we needed the seven
[1:35:08] Shields we needed the Mysteries that had
[1:35:11] been contained in the back part of God's
[1:35:14] mind since the foundation of the world
[1:35:17] to be
[1:35:18] revealed so the prophet of God comes
[1:35:20] along and he lives an unusual
[1:35:25] life he has a strange way of presenting
[1:35:29] his
[1:35:30] message he's humble he's
[1:35:34] simple he comes and he speaks of the
[1:35:36] poles and he talks about
[1:35:41] fishing and a shoe with laces and a ENT
[1:35:45] and little room and all these and the
[1:35:47] world began scratching their head what
[1:35:49] is this you know you know he was a great
[1:35:52] healer he had great signs and wonders
[1:35:53] following his ministry he prayed for the
[1:35:55] King George of England he prayed for uh
[1:35:58] you know the the senator there all these
[1:36:00] different things but now what is this
[1:36:02] unusual
[1:36:04] behavior what are these strange
[1:36:07] mannerisms that are being exhibited
[1:36:09] forth through the life of the Prophet
[1:36:11] it's showing
[1:36:13] something he comes and preaches the
[1:36:15] message I believe it was 1961 rejected
[1:36:17] King the other morning I was lying on my
[1:36:19] back um 53 years to haven't done
[1:36:22] anything for the Lord all of a sudden he
[1:36:23] said I felt myself lifting up I saw my
[1:36:26] body lying there on the bed he went past
[1:36:28] the curtain of time
[1:36:30] right remember those Old Testament
[1:36:32] prophets encountered things that were
[1:36:35] not even entirely for them but was for
[1:36:38] the people they were sent to amen maybe
[1:36:41] they themselves weren't going into
[1:36:43] idolatry but the people
[1:36:45] were and the life and ministries of
[1:36:47] those prophets was illustrating what the
[1:36:49] people were going into here comes a prop
[1:36:51] he goes beyond the curtain of
[1:36:53] time Oh my he comes back and says it'll
[1:36:56] take perfect love to get there whatever
[1:36:59] you do don't miss it he goes Amen in the
[1:37:02] regions of the Lost he says at all cost
[1:37:05] avoid going to that place amen and then
[1:37:08] he goes out to to to Tucson Arizona out
[1:37:12] there to Sabina Canyon amen he has his
[1:37:15] hands up in the air praising the Lord a
[1:37:17] sword drops in his hand what is that
[1:37:20] friend it's a type it's a shadow it's a
[1:37:24] symbol of something that's coming upon
[1:37:26] the people there is a bride that has
[1:37:29] been predestinated to hear that message
[1:37:32] and to live forth those things we have
[1:37:35] been given the sword of the word of God
[1:37:37] in this hour and it's not to cut each
[1:37:39] other apart amen it's not to start sword
[1:37:42] fights it's not to start off fencing
[1:37:44] competition but it's to destroy our
[1:37:48] enemy it's to destroy cancer it's to
[1:37:51] destroy schisms in the body it's to
[1:37:53] destroy anything that stands between you
[1:37:57] and what God has purpos you to come to
[1:38:01] in this hour and the voice said this is
[1:38:03] not a sword this is the King's sword it
[1:38:08] was a golden scepter that was extended
[1:38:12] by the king to show there was a bride on
[1:38:16] the face of the Earth that when she
[1:38:18] received that word it would bring her
[1:38:20] and to his presence oh I feel like
[1:38:23] preaching now it didn't come just to
[1:38:26] give us theology it didn't come just to
[1:38:29] tell us I know the seals I know the
[1:38:31] godhead I know water baptism I know
[1:38:33] serpent
[1:38:35] seed I'll say this he didn't just
[1:38:37] preach the
[1:38:39] Rapture to produce a Rapture
[1:38:43] Doctrine that's right he didn't just
[1:38:46] preach the Rapture to give our
[1:38:50] heads
[1:38:52] something to spin the minds of the
[1:38:55] secular theologians he preached a
[1:38:58] Rapture because it was now time
[1:39:01] Hallelujah for a group of people to
[1:39:04] receive that Rapture message and to hear
[1:39:07] that shout and say there something on
[1:39:10] the inside of me that will respond to
[1:39:14] that voice and produce a translated body
[1:39:19] in the son and Daughters of God Amen
[1:39:23] Have You Been Changed by the message
[1:39:25] have you been changed amen by the
[1:39:28] standard of Holiness that was preached
[1:39:30] Have You Been Changed by the truth of
[1:39:33] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:39:36] of the Holy Ghost has the prophet's
[1:39:38] message transformed your
[1:39:40] life he didn't come to make us idolize
[1:39:43] William Bram right it didn't come to
[1:39:46] make him a figure of worship that the
[1:39:49] bride lifts up but it come to show
[1:39:53] brother and sister what God was able to
[1:39:58] achieve and accomplish in the life of
[1:40:00] one surrendered vessel right just as
[1:40:04] Christ was waved before the people
[1:40:09] Alpha Jesus Christ has been waved waved
[1:40:15] over the people again in this hour to
[1:40:17] show right there's more coming right
[1:40:20] there's more with that same life that
[1:40:22] same DNA that same identity that same
[1:40:26] signs and wonders and healings and the
[1:40:29] love that Christ showed they're out
[1:40:32] there they're out there in the field
[1:40:35] they're already in existence the
[1:40:37] materials is already there right the
[1:40:39] Rapture brother said is already inside
[1:40:41] of you amen but it will take this
[1:40:44] message it will take the Holy Spirit to
[1:40:46] Quicken that and bring it into
[1:40:49] manifestation as they come back to the
[1:40:51] music
[1:40:51] tonight I want you to listen to
[1:40:55] this brother Reed talking about the
[1:40:57] seven
[1:40:58] Messengers he says how thrilling it
[1:41:01] is to think of those seven lamps drawing
[1:41:05] life and
[1:41:07] light from the resources of that Main
[1:41:11] Bowl because they had their Wicks dipped
[1:41:15] therein each Church age messenger is
[1:41:19] depicted here his life is on fire with
[1:41:24] the Holy Ghost his Wick life has been
[1:41:29] immersed in Christ through that Wick he
[1:41:33] is drawing the very Life of Christ and
[1:41:37] it and by it gives out light to the
[1:41:40] church what kind of a light is he giving
[1:41:43] the very same light that was in the
[1:41:46] first lamp that was lit and right on
[1:41:48] down the ages to the present time of the
[1:41:52] last day messenger the same life and the
[1:41:55] same light is manifested by a life that
[1:41:59] is hid with Christ in God are you
[1:42:06] listening and this
[1:42:09] Comfort is not for the seven Church age
[1:42:13] Messengers
[1:42:15] only oh I remember first time I got a
[1:42:18] computer my wife bought me this computer
[1:42:21] Compu and one of the first things I did
[1:42:23] when I hooked up the internet was I
[1:42:25] found a I found a message chat
[1:42:28] site
[1:42:31] brother well you don't got one like this
[1:42:33] one I guarantee you
[1:42:37] that I got on
[1:42:40] there they were just talking back and
[1:42:43] forth and they said oh we got a brother
[1:42:44] coming on here in the minute to
[1:42:47] preach and they were typing you know he
[1:42:49] was going to type his sermon out there
[1:42:51] sure enough here you come on about 10
[1:42:52] minutes
[1:42:54] later praise the Lord God bless you all
[1:42:56] and they type God bless
[1:42:58] you we're going to read tonight from
[1:43:01] we're going to go to scripture so and so
[1:43:05] amen can you type a few more things
[1:43:08] praise the Lord I thought
[1:43:12] this this is not the apostolic pattern
[1:43:15] I'm
[1:43:16] sorry I I and y'all forgive me for this
[1:43:19] but I told my wife I said I'm going to
[1:43:21] just take my hands and rake it across
[1:43:22] some key three or four times send it off
[1:43:24] and said I'm sorry I'm a
[1:43:27] Pentecostal can somebody interpret you
[1:43:34] know but they get on there you know and
[1:43:36] you get all kind of garbage people that
[1:43:39] they ain't going to darken the doors of
[1:43:40] a church ain't going to have a pastor
[1:43:42] ain't going to have headship they're
[1:43:44] waiting on the prophet to return all the
[1:43:46] supernatural was done in the prophet all
[1:43:48] the bride's Ministry was wrapped up in
[1:43:50] the prophet
[1:43:52] and here brother B says this Comfort is
[1:43:55] not for the seven Church age Messengers
[1:43:58] only every True
[1:44:01] Believer is in the hand of God and can
[1:44:06] draw from his love and
[1:44:09] power and receive the full benefit of
[1:44:14] all that God is to the
[1:44:17] believer what God gives the messenger
[1:44:21] and How He blesses and uses the
[1:44:25] messenger is an
[1:44:28] example is an example to all believers
[1:44:33] of his goodness and care to all members
[1:44:38] of his body
[1:44:40] amen I thank God for what he's done
[1:44:43] right in the life and Ministry of
[1:44:45] Brother
[1:44:46] Brad I thank God that he was translated
[1:44:49] beyond the curtain
[1:44:53] but I don't let
[1:44:55] that exalt brother bradam in my mind to
[1:44:58] a position of worship because he told
[1:45:01] John worship
[1:45:03] God I'm your fellow servant I'm your
[1:45:06] brother this is the testimony of Jesus
[1:45:10] Christ this is the spirit of Prophecy
[1:45:13] prophets are likened unto Eagles we are
[1:45:16] in the eagle age under the eagle
[1:45:18] anointing Anointed with the same
[1:45:21] prophecy The Same Spirit that brother
[1:45:23] venam was now what is prophecy it's the
[1:45:26] mind of God revealed it's the plan of
[1:45:29] God revealed it's God's purpose for the
[1:45:33] hour revealed through a prophetic
[1:45:35] Ministry now I don't believe we need an
[1:45:37] eighth messenger I don't believe we need
[1:45:39] anybody else to come up and complete
[1:45:41] anything that they suppose brother
[1:45:43] bradam left unfinished but I do believe
[1:45:46] that we must come under the same
[1:45:48] anointing that we may live out and act
[1:45:53] out the things that were prophesied
[1:45:57] through the ministry of the prophet and
[1:45:59] one of those things is the TR body
[1:46:01] change one of those things is a
[1:46:03] translation and brother and sister by
[1:46:05] the grace of God I believe with all my
[1:46:08] heart that I will become the very living
[1:46:13] expression amen of what was shattered
[1:46:16] and tiped and Illustrated through the
[1:46:18] life of that Prophet I believe that is
[1:46:20] the testimony of Jesus Christ and I
[1:46:22] believe that is the spirit of Prophecy
