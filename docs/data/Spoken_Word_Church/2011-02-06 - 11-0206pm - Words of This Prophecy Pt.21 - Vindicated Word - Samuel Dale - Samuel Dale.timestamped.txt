[4:53] be able to talk about you
[4:56] after all of these years we've never
[4:58] been able to exalt exhaust
[5:01] exhaust all the things that we see about
[5:04] you and we've only tried to exalt you
[5:07] into the position of who you are and
[5:09] where you're at and Lord we ask as you
[5:12] would just bless each one now come and
[5:14] speak to our hearts that as we may be
[5:16] led of thy Spirit to speak of Thy word
[5:18] that you would come and honor that by
[5:21] revealing it and then making it manifest
[5:23] among us we love you and we thank you
[5:25] just blessing God remember those that
[5:27] are not here brother Daniel away
[5:28] preaching remember each one have your
[5:31] way now in Jesus name
[5:33] oh man
[5:34] all right Revelations 1.
[5:42] maybe this will be the last time I said
[5:44] maybe okay
[5:47] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[5:49] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[5:51] the things which must shortly come to
[5:53] pass and he sent and signified by his
[5:55] Angel unto his servant John who by
[5:58] record of the word of God into the
[6:00] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[6:02] things that he sought blessed is he that
[6:04] readeth and they that hear the words of
[6:06] this prophecy and keep those things
[6:08] which are written therein for the time
[6:11] is at hand the time to reveal right so
[6:17] let's go back now to Hebrews 1.
[6:25] and we'll read the first like three
[6:27] verses
[6:28] God who at sundered times in diverse
[6:30] manner State spake in times past unto
[6:33] the fathers by or in other words in the
[6:37] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[6:40] unto us by or what in his son whom he
[6:44] hath appointed air of All Things by whom
[6:46] also he made the worlds who being the
[6:50] brightness of his glory and expressed
[6:52] image of his person and upholding All
[6:55] Things by the word of his power when he
[6:58] had by himself purged our sins set down
[7:01] on the right hand of the Majesty on high
[7:04] you may be seated the Lord that is
[7:06] blessing to the reading of the word
[7:14] now uh
[7:16] I pray and hope that you
[7:18] followed what I was saying this morning
[7:20] and a lot of that came to me to be able
[7:22] to say and that's the way I like to
[7:25] preach I like to preach when it's coming
[7:27] to me you know and giving me
[7:29] understanding but I pray that you would
[7:32] go back and listen to that message and
[7:35] try to make sure you get the connection
[7:37] of what I'm saying because I'm going to
[7:39] say it a few times this evening you know
[7:41] the same way that the the John that
[7:44] we're talking about on Patmos
[7:46] it it's not the time of revealing and
[7:50] that's where I believe people are
[7:51] getting it confused and then that way
[7:53] they're they're making brother Branham
[7:55] be the the one to come and they're
[7:57] trying to move it to here or move it to
[8:00] their to try to to establish it
[8:04] but uh you know I just can't see that
[8:08] that away you know and I believe it was
[8:11] The Profit that come to John but I want
[8:14] you to follow it we'll get into that in
[8:16] a little bit and and see something from
[8:18] the scriptures that have read all right
[8:20] now but I want you to to think about
[8:22] what I say in this morning now
[8:24] the in the writing of the book of of
[8:27] Revelations
[8:28] we read in there that uh you know that
[8:31] an angel come to John
[8:34] to write the book all right brother
[8:36] random as we'll get back to it in a
[8:38] minute said that that was the only book
[8:40] in the Bible whereas Jesus per appearing
[8:44] personally to the Scribe all right now
[8:48] John is described he is not the author
[8:52] actually of the book The Lord Jesus
[8:54] Christ is the author of the book
[8:56] actually he is just described you know
[8:59] writing down after the author brings it
[9:01] in other words like somebody sitting in
[9:03] brother collie I would say now brother
[9:04] Kali you can type so I'll tell you my
[9:07] life story you type it because see that
[9:09] would be delivered to somebody else to
[9:12] to handle the point but I hope you was
[9:15] listening to what it was saying see back
[9:18] there when that was written John saw a
[9:21] lamb 2000 years ago because that was
[9:24] 1895 and 96 basically is when John was
[9:27] writing the The Book of Revelation and
[9:30] he saw a lamb and he saw him come forth
[9:32] and take the book and the things you
[9:34] know and he wrote it in symbolics and
[9:37] you know to open the word all right that
[9:40] was in the writing of the book all right
[9:42] see because it would be completed then
[9:45] because God would be riding now as I
[9:48] said this morning he was writing the
[9:50] book about a finished product and we are
[9:54] the people of the book you know the the
[9:57] entire Bible it's people
[9:59] all right so back there he could write
[10:02] about what was going to be in the church
[10:04] ages to come and things like that and
[10:07] put it in a book and give it to John to
[10:11] write to to let the people have it and
[10:13] they could read it
[10:15] because it was the writing of the book
[10:17] all right and then that the lamb came
[10:19] forth took to the book out of the hand
[10:22] of the one that was uh sitting on the
[10:24] throne and you know and doing those
[10:27] things and open the seals and we see
[10:29] that all right but see then
[10:33] there was parts of that book that was
[10:36] not totally completed because it was
[10:39] writing about future things to come all
[10:43] right so in writing about the future
[10:45] things to come it would be writing about
[10:48] the Bride of Jesus Christ okay and
[10:51] writing about her then when that book is
[10:55] completed the prophet said then the lamb
[10:58] can take the book after it's completed
[11:01] see all right you go into the breach and
[11:04] the different things you know and and
[11:06] you'll find the statements that I'm
[11:07] making
[11:08] that after the book is completed or in
[11:11] other words after the book Is Made Alive
[11:13] here in the end time we see that the
[11:17] prophet said that that
[11:19] lamb having the seven horns and seven
[11:22] eyes it actually came from the church
[11:24] ages it was produced by the church ages
[11:28] just as the Old Testament the lamb was
[11:30] produced by the by the people you know
[11:34] bringing forth Jesus Christ all right
[11:37] sin he's to come forth again in the end
[11:39] time in Bride form to fulfill
[11:42] Revelations 1 uh 13 and all standing in
[11:46] the midst of the seven golden
[11:47] Candlestick well as it is when that's
[11:49] completed
[11:51] then this we are the not you and I going
[11:53] we're not going to Israel that's not you
[11:56] know no no uh it is this message that
[11:59] will go to Israel but not just bet
[12:03] hates and books and and they've already
[12:05] got this message brother Perry green
[12:07] years ago uh made sure they had the
[12:10] message over there you know and they
[12:11] played it on things we've seen it on
[12:13] their TVs their things you know all
[12:16] right but that's not it it's it's when
[12:18] the message is Made Alive by the Bride
[12:21] of Jesus Christ and being made alive see
[12:24] then that can go to Israel and see the
[12:28] lamb then brought around him is right
[12:29] when he's saying that the lamb comes
[12:32] forth from the church ages
[12:34] to take the book not for back there
[12:38] but for over here the word this book can
[12:41] go to Israel see he's going to take this
[12:45] book and break the seals off and show
[12:47] Israel that they rejected this message
[12:50] but the Gentiles has accepted the
[12:53] message and thereby you know we can we
[12:56] are ready to go all right now so in
[12:59] doing that now we'll try to
[13:01] um
[13:03] to just make sure you understand one
[13:05] thing then we'll jump on over real quick
[13:07] see make sure you understand if you
[13:09] don't ask me questions about it you know
[13:11] maybe I don't understand but that's all
[13:13] right I really enjoy preaching you know
[13:16] and have a good time talking about the
[13:17] Lord and the things I see but
[13:21] see then that puts it into like two
[13:24] parts
[13:25] one is for back there of the literal
[13:28] writing of the book then John didn't
[13:30] have to be translated over here to see
[13:33] it he only wrote what he saw which would
[13:37] be the visions of down here and the
[13:41] people and the things amen it would be
[13:43] doing those things and that way you
[13:45] don't have to have pre-existences or or
[13:48] I guess it's post-existence or what it
[13:51] is coming meaning later or you know the
[13:54] future and and all and uh I never could
[13:57] understand that because I can't keep
[13:59] folding pretty straight but that's all
[14:00] right but you know I just believe it all
[14:04] right see that way you don't have to
[14:06] worry about whether it was brother
[14:07] Branham that come to John on Patmos
[14:10] your concern will be about the great one
[14:14] that would come to do all things all
[14:17] right that great one would be the one
[14:20] that I tried to preach to you about you
[14:22] know a few weeks ago a few Services back
[14:25] when I was talking about the reason I
[14:27] didn't believe it because I I believe
[14:29] that's the one brother Brown was waiting
[14:31] on he was waiting on
[14:34] one to come right all right and it
[14:37] couldn't come into early Ministry
[14:39] because the background was not there of
[14:42] the opening of the word as far as the
[14:44] faith of the fathers he couldn't come
[14:46] back there on Azusa Street and walk out
[14:49] there and say I am uh the god of Abraham
[14:52] Isaac and Jacob and he couldn't hardly
[14:56] he couldn't say that Jehovah the old is
[14:58] Jesus of the new
[15:00] to those people because their Pentecost
[15:02] I mean Zeus is straight Pentecost now
[15:04] they were actually trinitarians
[15:07] the one that's Doctrine started after
[15:09] that somewhere around 1912 14 through
[15:12] there you start the Oneness type of form
[15:14] of Doctrine because they were
[15:16] trinitarian how could he explain the
[15:18] seals to them
[15:19] right how could he explain the things to
[15:21] those people it took him 30 something
[15:23] years to get word that he could preach
[15:25] the statue of a perfect man now that's
[15:27] what he said about it and watch it in a
[15:30] minute now the two parts will run around
[15:31] this message that we've tried to express
[15:34] to you and it'll help you to understand
[15:37] what I'm trying to get to because you
[15:40] see I believe the great one is the Lord
[15:42] Jesus Christ I believe that's the one
[15:45] that come to John on Patmos right
[15:48] right was the Lord Jesus Christ because
[15:49] that's what the scripture says man the
[15:52] Revelation that God give to Jesus to
[15:54] give to John and then brought around
[15:55] page 12 13 of the church age book he
[15:58] said it was the only book whereas a
[16:00] prophet personally or Jesus personally
[16:02] appearing to a scribe
[16:04] now brother let me say this and then
[16:06] we'll get back to it in a minute see
[16:08] John the Revelator was not a prophet
[16:11] like Moses Elijah wrote a random Etc
[16:16] right he could be a prophet in The Fault
[16:19] Ministry but he was not a prophet
[16:23] to do the so you say well the word come
[16:26] to the prophet
[16:28] well it's all right
[16:30] but remember who came
[16:33] it was the Lord Jesus Christ now you
[16:36] watch that you'll see what I'm talking
[16:37] about in Hebrews one in a minute all
[16:40] right and we'll follow that point down
[16:43] but remember now we're dealing with the
[16:46] writing of the book
[16:48] and then that way I said I don't believe
[16:50] right around came back there that would
[16:52] be pre-existence
[16:54] because you'd say well now brother Dale
[16:57] we don't believe that brother Branham
[16:58] come back there physically
[17:01] we believe he come back to our in
[17:03] theophany
[17:05] well
[17:07] I'm just honest as I could be
[17:10] I've always thought that Prophet meant
[17:14] word and flesh right
[17:19] I mean that was always my concept of it
[17:22] was word and flesh
[17:25] that's what it was to Moses
[17:28] the Moses was the word made flesh
[17:31] those prophets were the word made flesh
[17:34] for their time
[17:35] the Lord Jesus was the god of the
[17:37] prophets the prophet all right so then
[17:40] keep that in your thoughts as we go
[17:42] through something and then I'll try to
[17:44] hurry up and get through
[17:47] thank you see I believe the great one
[17:49] that come to brother Branham was the
[17:51] Lord Jesus Christ
[17:52] that's right just as the great one that
[17:55] come to John
[17:58] was the Lord Jesus Christ
[18:00] to write the book all right now in the
[18:04] writing of the book then you see it and
[18:06] then the revealing of the book would be
[18:07] the same I got right here it says
[18:09] explain it lent now
[18:12] remember you're dealing with the writing
[18:15] of the book
[18:17] and not the revealing of the book right
[18:20] there's two thousand years difference
[18:22] almost
[18:23] 1970 25 if you want to be technical
[18:28] or you know somewhere in that 20.
[18:32] see there's that much difference between
[18:33] the writing of the book and the
[18:36] revealing of the book
[18:38] there's a vast difference between those
[18:39] things it had to be written first to be
[18:42] put into book form right right
[18:46] then that book form could come alive in
[18:50] you and I
[18:52] and we would be the words that are on
[18:54] the pages living reality of Jesus Christ
[18:58] all right then that can be taken to
[19:01] Israel
[19:03] because it's got to be in a live book it
[19:05] can't be a just letters on the page it
[19:08] ain't going nowhere it is going to say
[19:09] we want you to know we're going to start
[19:11] here in Acts 1 we're going to start
[19:12] hearing that we're going to read here
[19:14] now
[19:17] as I said I don't think they'll take
[19:18] right around this message and say this
[19:21] is on page so and so this is on but no
[19:24] they'll go over there and they'll preach
[19:27] the Lord Jesus Christ from their own
[19:31] experience
[19:34] of the Holy Ghost coming in them
[19:36] all right the alive word to them and
[19:40] then naturally that will cover us one
[19:42] because they'll have to tell about us
[19:45] so that'll be fine all right now
[19:49] see it would have to be as I said
[19:51] written
[19:53] before
[19:55] you could take it
[19:57] to break the seal so it's written back
[19:59] there
[20:00] right all right now that's written down
[20:02] here and you and I then it can be
[20:04] revealed to Israel from there but you
[20:07] remember the message now that I I spoke
[20:10] on a couple of services and I tried to
[20:12] tie it together that
[20:15] The Book of Revelations then would be
[20:18] written
[20:19] the same as the Book of Genesis right
[20:25] now the Lord Jesus Christ came to John O
[20:28] Pat Mr Wright
[20:29] now the Lord Jesus Christ
[20:33] came to Moses into burning bush
[20:38] you saw now that wouldn't Jesus the
[20:39] flesh I didn't say that
[20:42] when I say the flesh I know how to say
[20:44] flesh
[20:45] it was Jesus Christ it was in that
[20:47] burning bush because see the Bible is
[20:50] correct it says that what
[20:53] the Bible was written by the prophets
[20:56] because the word comes only to the
[20:58] prophets all right Amos 3 and 7 will do
[21:02] nothing but revealeth his secrets and do
[21:03] his service to prophet
[21:05] all right
[21:07] and all the Bible would be written the
[21:09] same way
[21:11] now
[21:13] you remember how we brought that out
[21:16] from The Burning Bush Moses in meeting
[21:19] God which was Christ in the burning bush
[21:22] you've uh I don't think I gave you them
[21:25] but you shouldn't need them anyway
[21:27] you know there's enough to where we can
[21:29] do it and talk about it because of what
[21:30] we preach but anybody on tape let me
[21:32] know if you don't see that see Christ
[21:35] was the angel that was in the burning
[21:36] bush according to the book of Acts
[21:38] all right that was the angel of the
[21:41] Covenant that was Christ not Jesus the
[21:43] flesh no but it was Jesus Christ the
[21:47] angel of the Covenant
[21:48] that met Moses in the burning bush and
[21:51] told him what to write in Genesis
[21:53] well it was
[21:55] the Lord Jesus Christ that come to John
[21:59] to tell him what to write in the Book of
[22:00] Revelations
[22:02] so you got the whole thing being written
[22:04] by
[22:06] the prophets
[22:08] all right
[22:09] now
[22:10] in doing that then
[22:16] I I mentioned it this morning I just
[22:18] left the thought in your mind
[22:20] then what about the writing of Matthew
[22:22] Mark Luke John uh the book of Acts Peter
[22:26] on Paul
[22:28] oh James you know
[22:30] and the things
[22:32] now you know they wrote the Bible
[22:34] right
[22:36] right
[22:38] know what they wrote about
[22:40] they wrote about their day that's right
[22:44] right they wrote about what they saw
[22:47] they wrote about what they experienced
[22:49] they wrote about what they lived
[22:52] all right now but you know who brought
[22:55] that to him
[22:57] was it not the same Lord Jesus Christ in
[23:00] the form how did Paul say he got it
[23:02] right not from man but he said he got it
[23:05] from God I know how to get it from God
[23:07] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[23:09] was inside of him right
[23:12] that Holy Ghost is the one who was
[23:15] responsible to bring to those people to
[23:19] write but get the point now they wrote
[23:22] what they were experiencing
[23:25] amen there would be some prophecy out of
[23:29] Paul
[23:30] and things and the different ones that
[23:33] would be speaking of a later time yes
[23:35] but basically their thoughts were based
[23:38] upon what they were experiencing what
[23:42] was taking place
[23:44] and they straightened it out there's
[23:46] Paul wrote around and said Paul
[23:47] straightened Outlaw in Grace they
[23:49] bringing it to the correct understanding
[23:52] he was bringing it like that all right
[23:54] and that would be the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:57] speaking through the baptism of the Holy
[23:59] Ghost to them bringing that
[24:02] amen all right that would be the Lord
[24:05] appearing to them but brother random
[24:07] made the specific point of saying see
[24:10] that
[24:11] The Book of Revelation was written by
[24:13] the Lord Jesus Christ appearing
[24:15] personally now he said the only book in
[24:18] the Bible that's right right right
[24:21] whereas the Lord Jesus Christ appearings
[24:23] personally
[24:26] to write see because the Book of
[24:28] Revelations was going to be of future
[24:31] things
[24:32] more than just what was there
[24:35] he starts out in chapter one
[24:38] showing you the future of the Bride we
[24:41] went through those things right right
[24:43] see that's why it says if you notice in
[24:45] the scripture happen these last days
[24:48] spoken unto us yeah by his son
[24:52] all right
[24:53] so in other words anything after Paul
[24:59] all right anything after Paul in the
[25:02] writing of the Hebrews or writing the
[25:04] scriptures you know are them writing
[25:05] anything after that would have to come
[25:08] to word that Jesus Christ would appear
[25:10] to write the future
[25:12] he's not just writing about what's going
[25:15] on he's going to tell the future so he
[25:19] personally appears who the prophet why
[25:22] because the word come to the prophet
[25:24] now don't you remember how much we've
[25:26] been over and over the revelation
[25:31] what
[25:33] how many times we read Revelations 1
[25:35] the Revelation that God give to Jesus
[25:41] right right so Jesus is the prophet
[25:45] so then he could come and live in a
[25:48] disciples
[25:50] and tell them how to write of their day
[25:53] and time where they were and some
[25:55] prophecies of the future
[25:58] but then he would come to John
[26:01] to take it into a
[26:05] D and he would sin and signify what he
[26:07] was talking to John about bye an angel
[26:12] brother said that's got to be a prophet
[26:16] all right now so we're right back where
[26:19] we've been all the time
[26:20] I believe
[26:22] not that brother random come to John on
[26:24] Batman us know I believe be Prophet come
[26:27] to John on pouch the Lord Jesus Christ
[26:31] the god of the prophets the prophet the
[26:34] great one
[26:36] all right now I gave you a couple of
[26:38] things I may not finish this sermon this
[26:40] even if I don't I'll finish it later any
[26:42] word about it look what you got now over
[26:45] just on the page it's the back page of
[26:47] you know so that doesn't have nothing on
[26:49] one side okay
[26:51] and look what brother Brown says about
[26:53] it because I brought these out this
[26:55] morning or you know last night before
[26:57] when I was finishing up writing my notes
[26:59] and things
[27:01] now remembered it got up this morning
[27:03] and ran these off to where it ran look
[27:06] what he says in the breach 1963 317.
[27:09] he's talking about that the prophets who
[27:11] wrote the word at the sounding of the
[27:13] seventh angel and coming down and
[27:15] Elusive to the church ages
[27:18] um what been probed at in time and when
[27:20] the seals are broke and the Mystery is
[27:23] revealed
[27:25] down comes the angel
[27:30] the messenger
[27:32] now that's not brother Branham right
[27:37] right
[27:39] are
[27:41] well because right around here watch
[27:43] Christ setting his foot up on the land
[27:46] and up on the sea with a rainbow over
[27:48] his head now remember this seventh angel
[27:52] is on Earth at the time of this coming
[27:57] amen so that was brought around him on
[28:00] Earth the seventh angel we're going to
[28:02] split that Ministry in just a minute so
[28:03] you'll see what I'm talking about all
[28:05] right and there he was on Earth and then
[28:07] here comes the great one
[28:11] that's what I believe Here Comes The
[28:13] Great One to to
[28:16] tell right around him watch his brain
[28:19] well then it would be the great one back
[28:21] there that would tell John what to write
[28:23] that angel that come to John would be
[28:25] the great one brought around covers it
[28:27] over and gets into the scripture see
[28:28] that that messenger that come to John
[28:30] would have to be a prophet
[28:33] huh
[28:36] and that's fine he even said I don't
[28:37] know I may have it in Europe you said
[28:39] that it may have been Elijah
[28:42] we don't know who it is he said
[28:45] but see everybody knows it was brought
[28:47] around them you know that's the way
[28:49] they're bringing
[28:50] well see they now you've got
[28:52] pre-existence and and posts you've got
[28:55] all kind of things and and it just won't
[28:58] line up
[29:00] but see the great one will
[29:02] that's who brother random was waiting on
[29:05] and like I told you even the angel that
[29:07] was with him
[29:08] that was right around them from birth
[29:10] why didn't he tell him what the seals
[29:12] were
[29:15] even the great one on the the Ohio river
[29:19] that announced and said as your message
[29:21] for John the Baptist 4 run the first
[29:23] come in your message before on the
[29:25] second coming but he still didn't tell
[29:27] him what the seals were
[29:29] that would have been who Gabriel to
[29:31] announce the second coming right
[29:33] all right we covered all of those things
[29:35] but it wouldn't be the one that could
[29:38] have opened the seals
[29:40] only the lamb can break the seals
[29:45] man only the lamb can and on the whole
[29:48] only the Holy Ghost can reveal to the
[29:50] lamb and the Holy Ghost must be the same
[29:52] person
[29:53] or else you're messed up right but going
[29:55] down this is a continual reading so just
[29:57] keep reading
[29:59] that was page 40
[30:01] 742 this 74 3.
[30:05] just as John was giving his message the
[30:07] same time that Messiah come in the days
[30:11] all right Messiah companies talking
[30:13] about the great one to come the prophet
[30:15] would be here the great one would come
[30:18] just as John the Baptist was giving his
[30:21] message who came
[30:24] the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:26] right
[30:27] at the same time that the Messiah come
[30:29] in that in the days John knew he would
[30:31] see him because he was going to
[30:33] introduce him and we realized that in
[30:35] the scripture over in Malachi 4 there's
[30:38] to be one like John and Elijah to whom
[30:41] the word of God can come to amen we
[30:45] believe it don't we and he is to reveal
[30:47] by the holy spirit all the mysteries of
[30:50] God and restore the face of the children
[30:52] back to the faith of the apostolic
[30:54] fathers restore back all these Mysteries
[30:57] that's been probed out through these
[30:59] denominational ages those years
[31:03] now that's what the word said
[31:05] I'm just responsible for what it said
[31:08] I'm just responsible for what it said
[31:11] see it's written
[31:14] is right that's what it is now watch it
[31:17] now we see that this seven seal book now
[31:21] is the mystery of redemption
[31:24] it's a book of redemption from God
[31:27] now all the Mysteries at this time
[31:29] should be finished at the sounding of
[31:32] this Messenger right all right that was
[31:35] the years of preparation I brought
[31:36] around this ministry from 47 to 63.
[31:41] right
[31:43] and here's the angel on Earth
[31:47] no the messenger blood around them in
[31:50] other words
[31:52] and another I enjoy Mighty messenger
[31:54] come down
[31:55] see this Angel was an Earthly Angel
[31:58] messenger But Here Comes the one down
[32:01] from heaven a rainbow Covenant see only
[32:04] Christ it could be just like it was in
[32:08] Revelation the first chapter standing in
[32:10] the midst of the seven golden
[32:12] candlestick
[32:13] with a rainbow to look upon this Jasper
[32:15] and sort of stone
[32:17] so who wrote the Bible
[32:21] the word of God come into the prophets
[32:24] okay but as I said about the writing of
[32:28] Matthew Mark Luke and John and I
[32:30] they were writing what took place
[32:33] and relationship to what was living are
[32:36] and then Paul would prophesy of things
[32:39] to come you know the Rapture Etc sure
[32:42] why because he was the greatest of all
[32:44] of those and understood more than all
[32:46] the rest of the Apostles you agree
[32:49] all right now but yet when it comes to
[32:52] John on patlis
[32:55] it's just not the Lord Jesus listen to
[32:58] him saying it's not just the Lord Jesus
[33:00] coming to John right
[33:04] you're not listening it's the Lord Jesus
[33:07] coming to the angel to come to John
[33:10] now about the first service I preached
[33:12] on this whole thing I said watch that
[33:15] angel he begins to step back out of the
[33:17] way why because once Christ steps on the
[33:21] scene
[33:22] the angel is not important
[33:25] amen
[33:26] when Christ comes on the scene to you
[33:29] it doesn't do away with brother Branham
[33:31] he puts it in the right place but Christ
[33:35] is the one we're talking about
[33:37] see he's the one so brother Ritter makes
[33:39] Revelations 10 1 the same as Revelation
[33:43] 1 13.
[33:46] but again you understand what I'm saying
[33:48] he could the the apostles could write
[33:51] what was going on and a situation around
[33:54] them and the word being brought to them
[33:56] as to why they believed it like they
[33:59] were like the the disciples see Peter
[34:01] explaining how to climb up the statue of
[34:03] a perfect man that he had experienced it
[34:05] all right but then when it comes to
[34:08] Patmos
[34:09] the Revelation come to get Jesus
[34:12] right to give to the angel to give to
[34:17] John
[34:18] all right and see that way then we
[34:20] believe that that was the prophet that
[34:22] come to John on Patmos right
[34:26] the prophet
[34:29] I I asked the brother that I talked
[34:31] about it one day I said well why would
[34:33] you want to narrow it down to one
[34:36] you know why wouldn't you believe it's
[34:38] all the prophets
[34:40] he said well I never thought of it I
[34:41] said why don't you believe it the
[34:43] prophet is the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:47] right
[34:49] you know I mean I'd rather go that way
[34:51] than any way I know of
[34:53] if I'm wrong come and tell me I don't
[34:55] internet you hear it come I'm sure it
[34:57] may get some response off of that and I
[34:59] open it up and say come and tell me
[35:01] because I want to be right
[35:04] but see it's like I told you to start
[35:07] with I'm not concerned where brother
[35:09] Branham come to John I'm concerned where
[35:11] Jesus come to bread around them
[35:16] because that's where my connection is at
[35:19] is where the Lord Jesus Christ come to
[35:21] brother random to tell him this thing
[35:23] that's the one I'm concerned with right
[35:27] because all of my hopes are set upon
[35:29] that that doing it all right
[35:31] now
[35:34] make on these things
[35:37] all right if you need one on the Christ
[35:39] being the angel of the Covenant I didn't
[35:40] give it to you but it's off the message
[35:41] love 57 519 and it's also uh
[35:46] paragraph 88 87 uh we would see Jesus
[35:50] right because he's the angel of the
[35:53] Covenant see
[35:55] all right then who did we see now listen
[35:58] who did we see come to Moses
[36:03] the Lord Jesus Christ right
[36:06] but what form was he in
[36:09] he was in the form of the son of God
[36:16] right
[36:18] he was in the form of the son of God
[36:22] in other words the logos the theophany
[36:28] God himself in another form
[36:32] right which would have been who
[36:35] would be coming to Moses right the son
[36:38] of man would be coming to him who the
[36:40] word that's right
[36:42] you know not a flesh standing out there
[36:44] it was a burning bush
[36:46] Moses turns out to be that one that's
[36:49] called the son of man
[36:51] but Moses emphatically stated listen
[36:53] that God is going to raise up a prophet
[36:56] like unto me
[36:59] if you don't hear that prophet
[37:03] you're going to be in bad shape
[37:05] read it Moses at the burning bush where
[37:08] he tells him what to do and things I am
[37:10] the that that I am you know I am that I
[37:12] am and when it when it scripture finish
[37:15] it up it says beware of mine Angel
[37:18] because my name is in him
[37:22] I only wouldn't use the name wrote on
[37:24] his back he's walking out this is who I
[37:26] represent you know that was the Lord
[37:28] Jesus Christ a prophetic form of
[37:31] almighty God
[37:33] the son of man the word
[37:36] that come to Moses
[37:38] and Moses wrote it because he was a
[37:41] prophet because the word always come to
[37:43] the prophet
[37:45] all right and in doing it then what are
[37:47] we dealing with we're dealing with the
[37:49] Christ
[37:51] so who come to John on Patmos
[37:55] an angel come to Moses to write
[37:59] which is the Christ the angel of the
[38:01] Covenant the Son of God the Lord God
[38:04] everything like that would be who come
[38:06] to Moses to write that's how he knew
[38:08] what happened in Genesis the first
[38:09] chapter
[38:11] second third and fourth chapter fifth is
[38:13] basically writing about what's taking
[38:15] place
[38:16] you know
[38:18] are the laws and the things but it's
[38:20] something that's taking place
[38:22] whereas chapter I mean the beginning of
[38:25] chapter one of Genesis is about what
[38:27] good place
[38:29] that it would take a profit to get it
[38:31] right all right now so here we come then
[38:33] to John on Patmos
[38:37] the Revelation that God give to Jesus
[38:42] you remember I was bringing that up back
[38:44] there the Revelation that God gave to
[38:47] the angel of Christ to bring to Moses to
[38:50] tell him I was written
[38:52] no he wants right so he got the same
[38:55] thing happening in the Book of
[38:56] Revelation
[38:57] same identical Point all right the angel
[39:00] that came to Moses was the prophet not a
[39:04] prophet he was the Christ the son of the
[39:06] Living God all right now we're going to
[39:08] get down to stardom
[39:10] because the word comes only to the
[39:12] prophet see the word came to the prophet
[39:14] the son of man
[39:15] the word the son of man
[39:19] came to a son of man
[39:22] right right to write
[39:25] okay
[39:27] so then that's what it's doing in the
[39:28] Book of Revelation all right now
[39:32] to write what Moses saw him let's see if
[39:33] we can get started now let's let's start
[39:36] on number one of your notes you ought to
[39:38] know this Moses was a prophet sent from
[39:40] God
[39:41] all right anybody to argue with that
[39:43] point there's something wrong with you
[39:44] and that's from expectation just in case
[39:47] people hear it 1950
[39:49] that he was a prophet and I only had the
[39:52] signs and then you go over to the
[39:54] unveiling of God 1964 614 number two on
[39:58] your notes and you'll find it Moses with
[40:00] the prophet the word come to listen the
[40:03] word can't come to Joshua
[40:07] that's right
[40:11] he couldn't do it
[40:13] it's got to come to Moses
[40:16] he was the major prophet of the hour
[40:18] amen see the word would never come to
[40:22] Joshua until Moses was gone
[40:24] now what come to
[40:27] Joshua
[40:29] Joshua's not listed as a prophet major
[40:33] Moses was the major
[40:36] that's why God told Joshua right off he
[40:40] said as I was with Moses I'll be with
[40:42] you you follow what Moses said to the
[40:45] letter and I'll back it up he didn't
[40:47] have to come with a new word then he
[40:49] started writing about what's taking
[40:50] place
[40:52] right
[40:53] he was writing what was taking place we
[40:55] went over here we done this we took care
[40:57] of that we you know I met this man over
[40:58] here he was writing those things that
[41:00] could be brought in to understand it but
[41:02] all that maybe remember was written by
[41:04] Moses
[41:05] thank you all right so follow what I'm
[41:08] saying Deuteronomy 18 15 raise up a
[41:11] prophet likened to me we're not talking
[41:14] about just a man we're talking about the
[41:16] God of the prophets
[41:18] the alive word Christ was the alive word
[41:21] spoken of in the book of Acts 3 in 20
[41:24] and through 24 so read that and then we
[41:26] won't in the book of Acts you finally
[41:27] was at the burning bush all right
[41:30] I believe the one that came to John
[41:32] to tell him what to write was the Lord
[41:34] Jesus Christ and the form of the son of
[41:37] man the prophet
[41:41] right the son of man the prophet
[41:46] Amber what would it be all right
[41:51] okay
[41:52] it would be page 12 13 Church age book
[41:55] personally appearing to ascribe to write
[42:00] um that's number six on your notes I'm
[42:02] going on down yeah but I'm just trying
[42:04] to let me let me read a few things
[42:10] you can read the notes in between of how
[42:12] the Ephesus and the thing let's just
[42:14] jump on down because I'm going to be
[42:16] late anyway
[42:17] let's go down to
[42:19] number six on your notes
[42:23] that's where he said this is usually
[42:25] termed of revelation of Saint John but
[42:27] that is incorrect it is the revelation
[42:29] of Jesus Christ given to John for
[42:32] Christians of all ages the only book in
[42:34] the entire Bible that is written by
[42:35] Jesus himself though personally through
[42:38] personally appearing to a scribe that's
[42:43] the book huh
[42:45] we found out that brother Branham would
[42:47] be on Earth but the angel would come to
[42:49] him
[42:51] we found out that the seals couldn't be
[42:53] broke by that angel that come to him
[42:55] daily but it could be on the other
[42:58] me
[43:01] but see Revelations 1 I gave you a
[43:04] couple of quotes back Revelations 1 says
[43:07] one standing in the midst of the seven
[43:08] golden Candlestick like unto the son of
[43:10] man I didn't say it was the son of man
[43:13] this in Bride form
[43:15] it made it lie
[43:17] under the son of man that's why we turn
[43:18] out to be the son of man all right now
[43:20] I'm trying to jump over Feist
[43:22] so look at number seven on your notes
[43:27] he's talking about
[43:29] Revelations
[43:31] 113.
[43:33] who is he
[43:35] this is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[43:37] and here he's not a prophet here he is
[43:40] the almighty God manifested the Alpha
[43:43] and Omega so remember we went through
[43:45] those things number eight he said he's
[43:47] not a not a Prophet this was God in
[43:50] Revelations one all right let's see
[43:52] everybody wants to go on over to the
[43:54] other one and try to make it brother
[43:56] random we'll leave it like it is it was
[43:58] the prophet
[43:59] the Lord Jesus Christ all right
[44:03] now
[44:05] it was the son of man the word
[44:09] the word that came to the prophet that's
[44:11] what I'm being concerned about
[44:13] my brother right I'm coming to somebody
[44:15] else right
[44:16] right
[44:18] he didn't come to John to write the book
[44:21] that's what you'd be doing with if you
[44:22] ain't careful you're making him come to
[44:24] John on Patmos to write the book
[44:27] and then you're saying that well the
[44:29] reason I'm saying that is because if the
[44:31] word only comes to the prophet well
[44:33] let's read what your Prophet had to say
[44:35] about this that took place on Patmos
[44:41] all right and this is the quotes that
[44:43] they use
[44:44] to try to prove John come to
[44:46] and brother Brown come to John on Patton
[44:48] well let's just read it all right this
[44:50] is taken from the fifth seal 1963 322.
[44:54] all right which is Page 359.
[45:00] he's bringing down about it and all of
[45:03] the things that's taking place go back
[45:04] and read the background have you caught
[45:06] anything
[45:07] I've just wondered
[45:10] if you would see yes sir I might not
[45:14] have to tell you then Sunday notice
[45:16] notice wonderful now notice
[45:20] now and then according to the the time
[45:23] that God was going to deliver the
[45:26] Andalusian world
[45:28] he sent the eagle
[45:32] and the time he was going to deliver
[45:34] Israel
[45:36] sent the eagle a eagle a prophet right
[45:40] do you believe
[45:41] that the time even on John on the Isle
[45:46] of Patmos this message was so perfect
[45:49] that he couldn't trust it with an Angel
[45:59] they couldn't trust it with an Angel
[46:01] let that anchor into you
[46:05] you know an angel is is a messenger
[46:08] but you know the messenger was a prophet
[46:10] you believe that let's prove it
[46:12] revelation 22 let's see if it was an
[46:15] eagle see he was sure he was an angel he
[46:18] was a messenger but it was a prophet
[46:21] that revealed This Book of Revelations
[46:22] to him
[46:24] Revelation 22nd then he goes down bring
[46:30] go down to number 10 right 360. now this
[46:34] the book was so important that it is the
[46:36] word of God now watch and then the word
[46:39] of God is when the word of God is
[46:42] brought forward it's got to be brought
[46:43] by the prophet because that's who the
[46:45] word of God comes to I was expecting to
[46:48] get a question on that
[46:50] in this in this box here I thought I'd
[46:53] just beat them to it a little bit you
[46:55] know I just feel there is one in there
[46:57] though and so
[46:59] and so I I just thought I'd get to it
[47:02] see every word of God is brought the
[47:06] Bible doesn't change its system at all
[47:09] it's the same thing it's got to come to
[47:11] this Seer that we're expecting to arrive
[47:17] he said we'll run around and brother
[47:19] Dale that was him
[47:24] well why was he expecting him to arrive
[47:26] wow he was just saying that to throw you
[47:29] off
[47:30] no he's saying because it's true
[47:33] it's expecting it to arrive
[47:36] all right
[47:39] let's hold a second on the other
[47:44] all right let's take something that
[47:46] we've always tried to express and bring
[47:50] now how throughout this series and I'll
[47:52] end it with trying to say this brother
[47:55] Reynolds message is in two parts
[47:58] according to 327 Church age book this
[48:01] messenger Malachi 4 is going to do two
[48:03] things one turn the hearts of the
[48:04] children back to the faith of the
[48:05] fathers two reveal the seven Thunders
[48:08] which is revelation contained in the
[48:09] Seven Seals it'll be these to finally
[48:11] reveal mystery truth that literally turn
[48:13] our hearts back so his message in two
[48:15] parts
[48:16] you'll see what I've been driving out
[48:17] all along why that angel could bring
[48:20] brother Brown them up so far the angel
[48:22] that met him and was with him from the
[48:24] birth could bring him up tell him about
[48:26] serpent seed tell him about the great
[48:27] things but then when it comes to the
[48:29] opening of the seals he couldn't do that
[48:32] I run around and called him a minor
[48:34] angel
[48:37] that's what he called him
[48:38] even called it the healing angel
[48:42] because it was a healing campaign went
[48:43] out according to Malachi
[48:46] healing in his wings but when it comes
[48:49] down to bringing the seals he couldn't
[48:51] do it
[48:54] right
[48:56] you couldn't bring it
[48:59] but who brought it to him
[49:01] who come to brother Branham to reveal
[49:03] the seals
[49:08] you surely don't want his own theophany
[49:11] to come to him
[49:12] as or to something that would be making
[49:16] it something like that to come to him in
[49:19] that form
[49:20] the
[49:22] Lord Jesus Christ come to me
[49:26] he said that it was Christ it met him he
[49:28] said the Holy Ghost met him in the room
[49:31] he said those angels came to him daily
[49:33] and they were seven angels
[49:36] do you need me to bring them they were
[49:38] seven angels that he met out there in
[49:40] Tucson
[49:42] man
[49:43] and he said an angel come daily in the
[49:46] room
[49:49] then everybody's tried to make it then
[49:50] that would be brother branham's you know
[49:52] the theophany see why why not stay with
[49:57] yeah the simple things have just
[49:59] following along and letting it be
[50:01] whatever and then when we get there
[50:03] we'll find out what took place in all
[50:05] these places
[50:06] you know but to try to figure them out
[50:08] is not going to bring you Rapture in
[50:10] faith it's not going to bring you
[50:11] Rapture and Faith to pray to say that
[50:13] brother Branham come to to John on patch
[50:15] that's I'm going to bring Rapture and
[50:17] faith
[50:22] it's going to take a revelation of God's
[50:23] word
[50:25] huh sure they wrote a random you have to
[50:27] have to know this ministry
[50:31] that the
[50:33] I need him
[50:34] throughout 30 something years there 33.
[50:37] what really let him on his life
[50:39] was with him from birth
[50:41] but then that angel that brought around
[50:44] me said we're waiting on one to come
[50:48] and there come he said that's why I've
[50:51] always wondered about that seventh angel
[50:55] well he saw that he would have
[50:57] connection to that seventh angel
[50:59] because he was the seventh angel the
[51:02] Earthly Messenger as we read there a
[51:04] moment ago from the breach he was the
[51:06] Earthly messenger the angel right
[51:09] and God didn't come down out of heaven
[51:11] and blast it to the World Council of
[51:13] churches and let them print it into
[51:15] articles and say they heard a voice out
[51:17] of Heaven telling them what these things
[51:18] were oh
[51:20] that would be contrary to the Bible so
[51:24] he come to the prophet
[51:25] to where the Prophet could deliver it to
[51:27] you and I
[51:30] right because we'd have to have a
[51:33] prophet in our day and brother Brandon
[51:36] was born to prophet
[51:38] but now what about these quotes
[51:47] what about these
[51:49] what about the scripture that brought
[51:51] around them always read
[51:53] do the work of an evangelist
[51:58] he didn't call me an evangelist
[52:01] he said for me to do the work of an
[52:03] imagination
[52:05] why because the time would come
[52:09] that something would take place
[52:11] he said I knew all along this message
[52:14] would come
[52:18] I couldn't have to right right do the
[52:22] work of an evangelist
[52:23] all right
[52:27] look at it that's questions and answers
[52:30] in Jeff 19 and 62 527 some of you may
[52:34] have it cropped off the top okay
[52:36] paragraph or page 731. paragraph 731
[52:41] . you don't like doing the work on
[52:42] Evangel he said it was laid in the
[52:44] Cornerstone
[52:45] now he never said you are an evangelist
[52:49] he said do the work of one
[52:51] now has the time come
[52:54] this is for the seals broke
[52:58] shall I continue on with that or has the
[53:01] time come for something else
[53:05] he said that I don't know
[53:09] and a lot of quotes run it into your
[53:11] computer about do the work of an
[53:12] evangelist and read all of them
[53:14] because then you're going down to
[53:15] spiritual food and do seeds in 1965 7-18
[53:20] you bring it down
[53:22] he said I haven't had a prayer line of
[53:25] this type for a long long time Hemi
[53:27] remembers my commission when we built
[53:29] the Tabernacle here he said do the work
[53:31] of evangelists didn't say I was in the
[53:33] veins it said do the work of evangelists
[53:35] see for the hour will come when that's
[53:37] to be changed
[53:39] and that hour was arriving
[53:42] all right
[53:44] but the lord gave me what I should do in
[53:46] my message when he said do the work of
[53:49] an evangelist see he never went on down
[53:51] if you remember you go through and read
[53:53] all of those things became questions and
[53:55] answers on the seals 1963. now if you
[53:58] notice when I laid the Cornerstone under
[54:00] that Tabernacle he said do the work in
[54:01] evangelists and now the hour is coming
[54:04] when that work is separated there's
[54:07] something else taking place then I'm you
[54:10] see I get here and try to do evangelics
[54:14] and something else and you see where
[54:16] you're at
[54:17] he's expecting the church to be
[54:19] spiritual standing in the Gap 1963 623
[54:22] the morning service do the work he was
[54:25] driving out and you know was sleeping
[54:27] Joseph or Billy Paul one got sleepy and
[54:30] he said return did I not tell you in the
[54:33] beginning do the work of an evangelist
[54:35] when I called you down on the river
[54:37] did not I say as John the Baptist was
[54:40] sent to forerun the first coming wasn't
[54:42] John more than a prophet Jesus said what
[54:45] it would have to do a prophet more than
[54:47] a profit
[54:52] through the work of an evangelist action
[54:55] that's where you divide brother Brown's
[54:57] Ministry
[54:59] but the first part just turned the
[55:01] hearts of the children back to the faith
[55:02] of the fathers that's quoting 3 27.
[55:06] he had to come to restore the original
[55:08] Doctrine back
[55:11] not at the Bible changed no
[55:14] the Bible always taught one God the
[55:17] Bible always taught water baptism in the
[55:19] name of the Lord Jesus Christ but we
[55:21] self-interpreted those things and made
[55:23] it wrong the prophet had to come to
[55:27] interpret those things
[55:29] and that's what that angel on Earth was
[55:31] doing he was the seventh Church age
[55:33] messenger
[55:36] right but he said if you make me the
[55:39] angel to lady osia
[55:42] he said you've messed it up
[55:44] why because it's got to go into a
[55:46] greater thing right
[55:48] and remember that there's eight churches
[55:51] Messengers
[55:54] not just seven
[55:57] oh yeah but there's just seven men but
[56:00] eight manifestations of God
[56:04] brother random 464 the seal book
[56:07] he tells you about what's to happen
[56:10] that how that this messenger wanted to
[56:13] do he said he calls him the prophet to
[56:15] come on nocturnal in Azusa Street
[56:20] he said but at the end the messenger
[56:21] would come
[56:23] see that Prophet that came in Azusa
[56:25] Street was the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:27] that stepped right over and brother
[56:28] Branham and began to carry on and
[56:31] bringing forth the first part of his
[56:32] ministry do the work of an evangelist
[56:34] because there'll come a time when you
[56:37] won't be doing the work of an evangelist
[56:38] you'll take the office of the prophet he
[56:41] stepped right into the office of the
[56:42] prophet in 1963 with the opening of the
[56:45] seals and from thereafter he was doing
[56:47] those things he would back up into it
[56:49] and use those gifts and do the different
[56:51] thing but he said that wasn't right
[56:55] but it was to help the people
[56:57] to get them to believe
[56:59] showing debate on the hook you know
[57:02] but we're supposed to believe the word
[57:03] to start with
[57:05] we're supposed to take what the word
[57:07] says
[57:08] so he was doing the work of an
[57:10] evangelist
[57:12] until that Mighty Angel met him on the
[57:15] out there in Tucson Arizona and they
[57:17] didn't tell him a thing out there if you
[57:19] want to read it that's what everybody
[57:20] says they took him up into this and told
[57:21] him it's not in the other day now you
[57:23] don't have no quotes for that the Angels
[57:25] told him it's a message the prophet said
[57:28] the angel told him to come home it would
[57:30] be told him
[57:32] right they didn't tell him anything out
[57:34] there like that about what the seals
[57:35] were because he'd be a liar because he'd
[57:37] come over to the first seal and said I
[57:38] don't know what it is in the breaching
[57:41] time if they told him what it was out
[57:43] there
[57:44] but they took him up into it sure I'm
[57:46] sure they told him some things that's
[57:48] right not for you and me to know
[57:50] and just getting the point there were
[57:52] seven angels
[57:54] that he met out there
[57:56] and everybody's wanted to make it Church
[57:58] age Messengers and things like that why
[58:03] well what that was was Luther's
[58:05] theophany Wesley's theophany so until
[58:08] why
[58:10] that's right
[58:12] what profit is that
[58:16] I want to know what they told him right
[58:22] show angel number one come to John and
[58:25] told him
[58:32] he had to crash
[58:36] me Angel Number Two come told him about
[58:38] the second seal third fourth fifth sixth
[58:41] and see then he would be connected to
[58:43] all of it
[58:45] understand what the angel would come to
[58:47] him
[58:50] which would be the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:54] come into the prophet to tell him what
[58:56] that Sabbath seal was
[58:59] and I were tired of his life and what
[59:01] was taking place
[59:03] and that would be the one that John
[59:05] would fall down to worship with that
[59:07] when it was all finished
[59:09] was the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[59:14] but you see people want to go that way
[59:16] and they don't want to finish up with
[59:18] the message
[59:19] run around and say it what
[59:21] so we hear that like 20 in our last
[59:23] night how come there's also many
[59:25] different doctrines over one message
[59:27] you know
[59:29] amen like how many doctrines are they
[59:32] about the Bible
[59:36] well are we going to heaven like he was
[59:39] saying is he asked that man when you get
[59:41] to heaven it's going to be a little
[59:42] place over here that the badges live a
[59:45] little place over here the master just
[59:46] live and a little place over here the
[59:48] Presbyterians live and then we hear the
[59:50] Pentecostals live you know because
[59:52] they're all split up
[59:54] okay
[59:56] no no brother then we don't believe that
[59:58] there's gonna be two Soul holes seventh
[1:00:01] under a virtual I don't mean hole excuse
[1:00:03] me seven Thunder virtual places and
[1:00:06] there's gonna be all kind of places
[1:00:08] I don't see it that way
[1:00:12] we don't all understand the same thing
[1:00:15] but we understand the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:17] all right
[1:00:19] but the prophet said what
[1:00:22] questions and answers 64 8 23 the
[1:00:26] perfect interpretation of the word of
[1:00:28] God with
[1:00:31] Divine vindication
[1:00:36] perfect interpretation of the word with
[1:00:38] Divine vindication
[1:00:39] and that which is in part is done away
[1:00:43] when I was a child I was thinking that
[1:00:45] child not just part like going away with
[1:00:47] the word not doing away with our part
[1:00:51] perfect interpretation has come to the
[1:00:53] Bride of Jesus Christ you know Wise come
[1:00:55] to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:00:59] because she's got a job to do
[1:01:03] it well we get all of this and we see
[1:01:05] brother Branham is that going to come to
[1:01:06] the iron with us that's all right that's
[1:01:08] gone whatever you're doing cool
[1:01:11] if that's all you got to hold on to I
[1:01:13] don't want to destroy you
[1:01:15] if all you got to hold on to is what you
[1:01:17] believe is a Baptist I don't want to
[1:01:19] destroy Madness because if you kill a
[1:01:20] man's Doctrine you kill a man
[1:01:23] you say well I want to destroy
[1:01:25] everything I can well there's something
[1:01:27] wrong with you
[1:01:30] I'm going to do what you want to
[1:01:33] here's the things they don't want to
[1:01:35] hear you say
[1:01:37] because you see
[1:01:40] we have to be the word My Flesh we have
[1:01:44] to take what the prophet said and become
[1:01:46] the word made flesh which will be these
[1:01:48] on a man
[1:01:49] the Lord Jesus Christ in his bride
[1:01:55] and then we are to vindicate
[1:01:59] bless God brother Branham was Vindicated
[1:02:02] amen nobody's going to argue me
[1:02:07] can't argue with you about it I know God
[1:02:09] Vindicated him
[1:02:11] but I know what he said
[1:02:16] don't get mad at brother random what he
[1:02:18] says here what we're fixing to read they
[1:02:19] get mad at you for finding it
[1:02:22] all right smart really
[1:02:24] well cold right around I'm smart at it
[1:02:27] I'm gonna run around and said in the
[1:02:29] message what sitting on an hour with the
[1:02:30] like 1965-18
[1:02:33] he's talking about how that it's come
[1:02:35] forward now here's the secret of the
[1:02:37] message
[1:02:39] he said it must be about my father's
[1:02:41] business
[1:02:42] um let's go back let's just read the
[1:02:44] whole thing
[1:02:45] I'm doing pretty good
[1:02:47] notice there will be no more carrier
[1:02:49] mother Church's denominations after this
[1:02:52] carrier shook because after the shut
[1:02:55] there's no more there's nothing left but
[1:02:57] them and just the grain is that right
[1:02:59] got to be the grain it's got to be the
[1:03:02] same kind that went into the ground
[1:03:04] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:03:06] and forever
[1:03:07] a Spirit come up on the bride to do the
[1:03:10] same things that he did
[1:03:12] it's through reproducing again of the
[1:03:15] grain the word yet young spoke for
[1:03:19] itself
[1:03:20] you remember what happened in no not
[1:03:22] that I must be about my father's
[1:03:24] business 12 years old 13 whatever he was
[1:03:27] listen there's the secret of the message
[1:03:29] now just like the father's business what
[1:03:32] is the father's business
[1:03:34] could you think of what the father's
[1:03:36] business was to him to fulfill what
[1:03:39] Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive
[1:03:41] fulfill what Isaiah said again
[1:03:44] the lame shall leak like a heart and all
[1:03:47] of these things that it take place like
[1:03:50] Moses said the Lord your God shall raise
[1:03:53] up a prophet among you like it unto me
[1:03:55] it was the father's business to fulfill
[1:03:57] that word
[1:03:59] well if that come down through them
[1:04:02] stalks of them Natural Women
[1:04:05] what about these stalks of these
[1:04:08] Spiritual Church women churches means
[1:04:10] women women means churches really is
[1:04:13] that right then what is it now we must
[1:04:17] be about the father's business the crew
[1:04:19] we would cry back the grain yes sir we
[1:04:23] must what must I do
[1:04:26] vindicate Malachi forward vindicate Luke
[1:04:29] 17 30. vindicate Hebrews 13 8 vindicate
[1:04:32] Saint John 14 12. vindicate all of his
[1:04:36] word vindicate Hebrews I mean Revelation
[1:04:40] the 10th chapter on the opening of The
[1:04:43] Seven Seals and the mysteries of God
[1:04:46] even to serpent seed and all that would
[1:04:49] be manifested marriage and divorce and
[1:04:50] all of these other Mysteries that's been
[1:04:52] hid under the pillars from from all
[1:04:55] these years from
[1:04:58] the theologians and so forth but it's
[1:05:00] now the hour that's the father's
[1:05:02] business
[1:05:06] the and
[1:05:08] we must be about the father's business
[1:05:14] but brother Dale I don't see how in the
[1:05:15] world we can vindicate Malachi 4. well I
[1:05:18] do very easily
[1:05:20] because Malachi forces him turn the
[1:05:22] harness of the children back to the
[1:05:23] faith of the fathers that's our part
[1:05:25] right
[1:05:28] Luke 17 30. well that's brother Branham
[1:05:32] and today when the son of man is
[1:05:33] revealed I believe the Bride of Jesus
[1:05:35] Christ is the son of man brother random
[1:05:37] was Ace on a man
[1:05:39] vindicate Hebrews 13 8 making him the
[1:05:42] same yesterday today and forever right
[1:05:45] vindicate Saint John 14 12. vindicate
[1:05:49] all of his words vindicate Hebrews I
[1:05:52] mean Revelations the 10th chapter we've
[1:05:54] got to vindicate that
[1:05:56] right but now brother Daniel well you
[1:06:00] know well it's set in the mouth to two
[1:06:01] or three businesses
[1:06:03] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:06:05] 1965-11-25.
[1:06:09] we're just ready for one thing that's
[1:06:10] the coming of the Lord there's your name
[1:06:12] on The Book of Life and the Book of Life
[1:06:14] is the word of God because the word is
[1:06:16] God and God is the only thing that's
[1:06:19] life your name was represented in the
[1:06:22] Bible before the Bible became on Word
[1:06:25] and if you're and if you're here to do
[1:06:28] that won't it vindicate
[1:06:32] that worked
[1:06:34] won't the church vindicate itself
[1:06:39] vindicate Malachi 4 and all of these
[1:06:43] other things perfectly perfectly
[1:06:44] vindicate itself and show that that's
[1:06:47] what it is
[1:06:53] but you see
[1:06:54] probably when I said that while ago
[1:06:56] about
[1:06:57] we've got to vindicate probably the
[1:06:59] computers went quick
[1:07:01] and they cut off you know people quit
[1:07:03] listening to you
[1:07:05] but that's what brother random said
[1:07:08] well brother Dale so you must be greater
[1:07:12] than him if you know how to straighten
[1:07:13] him out
[1:07:15] if you know how to straighten bread
[1:07:17] around them out you must be almighty God
[1:07:19] because that's the only step up above a
[1:07:21] Vindicated prophet that way but you see
[1:07:25] you just get upset with me for being
[1:07:27] that way to say it but why not say it
[1:07:31] I had a dream the other night I told my
[1:07:33] wife about it in the dream I wasn't
[1:07:35] hateful with the person I was just
[1:07:37] straight blunt
[1:07:41] plain and blunt
[1:07:45] that's the way it ought to be
[1:07:49] I'm gonna be that way plain and blunt
[1:07:52] you know you don't have to sugarcoat it
[1:07:54] to me you don't have to come around to
[1:07:56] just come up walk up say brother Dale I
[1:07:58] want to talk to you I think you're off
[1:07:59] the word
[1:08:01] you know I'm not going to slap you beat
[1:08:03] you around
[1:08:05] I'm going to sit down and listen to you
[1:08:11] and I'm not going to argue with you why
[1:08:12] are you doing it
[1:08:14] this way you know
[1:08:16] and if what you're saying is right then
[1:08:18] I even repent
[1:08:19] you know
[1:08:20] try and be helped
[1:08:22] I don't want to be right but if it ain't
[1:08:25] right then I won't tell you don't agree
[1:08:26] with you
[1:08:30] why because I believe we're in the end
[1:08:32] time
[1:08:33] if the bride of Christ is to be the son
[1:08:35] of man
[1:08:37] then she's not going to be deceived
[1:08:38] right that's right I cut out a lot of it
[1:08:41] you know in the notes what I had to say
[1:08:43] and but just think on this
[1:08:48] I hope you understand I'm going to say
[1:08:50] it one more time
[1:08:53] because Hebrews 1 says that in the last
[1:08:55] days he'd speak right my son
[1:09:00] all right his son is the word
[1:09:02] I believe that's what's happened unto us
[1:09:04] I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:07] the son of the Living God Matt brought
[1:09:10] around him in 1963.
[1:09:13] and broke those seals to him and told
[1:09:15] him what they were you couldn't trust it
[1:09:17] remember we read that quote you couldn't
[1:09:19] trust it with an Angel
[1:09:21] right so brother random in his ministry
[1:09:23] up until 63 couldn't be trusted with the
[1:09:26] revelation of those seals
[1:09:29] now where did he say that at
[1:09:32] okay that's what brother Dale said what
[1:09:35] do you say
[1:09:37] yeah
[1:09:38] what do you have to say about it at
[1:09:41] least I've endeavored to try to express
[1:09:42] it
[1:09:43] well I just don't want to get in them
[1:09:46] deep things
[1:09:48] beware of them this that this person's
[1:09:51] got all the answers
[1:09:53] I've only told you I didn't have them I
[1:09:55] just depend on somebody else
[1:09:58] but I've gone to phrase to go with that
[1:10:00] one beware of them that don't know
[1:10:02] nothing of what's going on in this
[1:10:04] message
[1:10:07] well that's Stacy
[1:10:09] you know let's just stay simple now
[1:10:13] brother
[1:10:13] run around come to John on Patmos
[1:10:16] that's just simple now you show me in
[1:10:19] the message where he said he did
[1:10:23] I go back to you show me the message
[1:10:25] where he said he did
[1:10:29] well which one there's five times
[1:10:36] which one would it have been
[1:10:43] but you see we think we've got a great
[1:10:45] revelation
[1:10:46] of something when
[1:10:48] it doesn't pan out
[1:10:51] I want the revelation of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:53] Christ
[1:10:55] and what he's got to do with me
[1:10:59] and to give me Rapture and faith
[1:11:02] to get out of here
[1:11:04] we're going to have an eternity to sit
[1:11:05] down and talk about all of the things
[1:11:08] that we went through here up on Earth
[1:11:11] and you know I won't mind saying then
[1:11:13] I'm wrong just as much as I'd say now
[1:11:15] I'm wrong but I want you to show me
[1:11:18] all right
[1:11:20] I just want you to show me
[1:11:24] well you just won't listen well okay
[1:11:28] and that proves I'm lost
[1:11:31] but you see
[1:11:33] I believe the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:36] come to John on Patmos
[1:11:41] and told him about the Book of
[1:11:42] Revelations
[1:11:45] you know in the writing
[1:11:47] told him what to write right yes
[1:11:51] told him what to write they're in the
[1:11:52] Book of Revelation now you understand
[1:11:53] what I'm saying the Bible the Book of
[1:11:55] Revelation the Lord Jesus Christ come to
[1:11:57] John to tell him what to write
[1:12:00] and I believe that same Lord Jesus
[1:12:02] Christ has to come
[1:12:04] in the end time okay
[1:12:07] to reveal the Book of Revelation
[1:12:11] and show us our part amen right let's
[1:12:15] Stand Together come on musicians
[1:12:17] I thought I'd be real long this evening
[1:12:19] I just cut out all I had to say about it
[1:12:21] so I was just reading
[1:12:24] I pray that God will help us to
[1:12:26] understand
[1:12:28] you know I could spend more months and
[1:12:30] months preaching on the Book of
[1:12:32] Revelations but
[1:12:34] the last thing I'll say we as brother
[1:12:37] run said the bride goes up Revelation 4
[1:12:38] 1 from 1941 to 1921 is to Israel and the
[1:12:44] things you know taking place upon the
[1:12:47] Earth so then it's not important to
[1:12:49] understand when Armageddon is going to
[1:12:52] be I want to know about the spiritual
[1:12:53] application of it taking place in my
[1:12:55] life
[1:12:57] all right
[1:12:58] I don't care about the tribulation
[1:13:00] because I don't want that
[1:13:02] I don't care about the white Throne
[1:13:04] judgment because I'm going to get to sit
[1:13:06] on it with him
[1:13:08] but I leave one thing with you that I've
[1:13:10] made over and over and over
[1:13:13] that in the Book of Revelation is the
[1:13:15] book only book in the Bible that you can
[1:13:18] find yourself so personally with it
[1:13:24] that you can't argue the point that's
[1:13:26] talking about you
[1:13:29] because Jesus is not shown in the Book
[1:13:31] of Revelations anywhere by himself
[1:13:36] he's always shown with somebody
[1:13:41] because that's what he always wanted
[1:13:44] right you always wanted what do we got
[1:13:46] 290 290 in the red book anybody have a
[1:13:50] name
[1:14:08] predestination
[1:14:13] hope I can get it done in a couple of
[1:14:14] messages no
[1:14:18] we're Eternal people anyway
[1:14:34] all to thee my blessings
[1:14:46] All to Jesus I Surrender
[1:14:52] on the edge
[1:15:01] what all
[1:15:03] forsaken take
[1:15:07] me
[1:15:09] let your desire
[1:15:12] we're all
[1:15:16] wrong
[1:15:21] the revelation of one true and living
[1:15:24] God
[1:15:29] so that's the whole Mountain
[1:15:34] oh
[1:15:50] Holy Spirit
[1:15:56] Brother Gary he's having problems with
[1:15:58] his feet and all not able to be with us
[1:16:01] today
[1:16:03] so just remember him
[1:16:22] oh
[1:16:25] I ain't surrender the Lord
[1:16:29] are you
[1:16:34] doing
[1:16:38] on the way home today
[1:16:40] Janet and the kids coming back in
[1:16:43] remember them all right
[1:16:46] I should
[1:16:48] River
[1:17:04] memorize surrender on
[1:17:10] All to Jesus
[1:17:14] my friend
[1:17:19] friendly great place
[1:17:52] in person
[1:17:57] that will yield their self to him
[1:18:00] well you know he said well okay now our
[1:18:04] brother colleagues you know ain't none
[1:18:06] of us got no problem no no
[1:18:08] that wasn't what he said
[1:18:12] well brother Branham was the only one
[1:18:14] that reeled himself to God so the rest
[1:18:15] of us not that wasn't what he was saying
[1:18:20] we are individuals in the body of Christ
[1:18:24] right each individual ought to believe
[1:18:27] that we are the one that he's talking
[1:18:29] about that can yield ourselves to him
[1:18:33] and they can use us
[1:18:36] because if not we might as well just
[1:18:38] shut the doors and go home and forget
[1:18:39] about it that's right but if you can
[1:18:41] believe you're the only one our Dr
[1:18:44] Prophet said if they wouldn't but one
[1:18:45] going into rapture
[1:18:49] I think he said out of a state didn't he
[1:18:52] one going
[1:18:54] well I'm sorry the rest of y'all got a
[1:18:56] problem you better find you another
[1:18:58] state and there's not enough States even
[1:19:00] though Obama's tried to make 57 there's
[1:19:03] not enough States
[1:19:07] for these people here in the building
[1:19:09] because there's more in 57 here
[1:19:12] but you see
[1:19:14] he's saying we got to believe we are
[1:19:16] that one
[1:19:18] that's right
[1:19:20] behold I send you Elijah the prophet I
[1:19:26] believe that's to me amen
[1:19:30] sister media I reckon when that was the
[1:19:33] scripture God gave her behold I send you
[1:19:35] Elijah and she knew to get married to
[1:19:38] him you know well if that was personal
[1:19:40] to her what about being personal to you
[1:19:42] and I
[1:19:44] just remember these things father
[1:19:47] we pray that the things that we said
[1:19:50] today would be
[1:19:52] talks that would be vital to our
[1:19:54] understanding
[1:19:56] I know sometimes is when we try to talk
[1:19:58] it's just
[1:20:00] sounds like we're just veins angling but
[1:20:02] we're not Lord we're talking about you
[1:20:05] but we give all the honor and Glory To
[1:20:07] You Lord
[1:20:09] no matter what it would be of who angels
[1:20:11] are and where they'd appear and what
[1:20:13] would take place all of the honor and
[1:20:15] glory is given unto you
[1:20:16] goes without you there wouldn't be any
[1:20:18] angels and wouldn't be any people
[1:20:21] just have your way with us Lord if we
[1:20:23] bring this series to a close
[1:20:25] maybe remember the words of this
[1:20:27] prophecy
[1:20:29] may we remember
[1:20:31] the things that we've heard about you we
[1:20:34] love you and we thank you in Jesus name
[1:20:37] amen you're dismissed pray one for
[1:20:39] another
[1:20:41] I have decided to follow Jesus
[1:20:52] please
[1:21:16] I'm sure
[1:22:21] foreign
[1:23:22] foreign
