things we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Proverbs chapter 16 we at verse one says the preparations of the heart in man and the answer of the tongue is from the Lord all the ways of man are clean in his own eyes but the Lord weth the spirits commit thy Works unto the Lord and thy thoughts shall be established the Lord hath made all things for himself ye even the wicked for the day of evil every everyone that is proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord though hand join in hand he shall not be unpunished but mercy and Truth by Mercy and Truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the Lord men depart from Evil when a man's ways please the Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right a man's heart deviseth his way but the Lord directeth his steps amen God bless you tonight you may be seated and uh with one title this God is in control and U just want to look at a few scriptures and things tonight but uh I was uh I was doing a little doing a little reading and uh I run across this man and uh you know uh people have a real real issue when you know uh trying to trying to come to the realization that you know God is in control of all things things he created all things he put everything in in motion and you know there's there's nothing that that didn't come into existence that God didn't put in place and and you know God has a law for everything he puts everything in in motion and and everything works just the way God created it but um I want to go to this quote I this quote is from God of this evil age and brother brandom says and the world seems to be in the most evil age that ever was he said never in any age did women act like that but just before the destruction of the Andel luian world and Jesus referred to it he said we'll get to that after a while he said has God lost control or is he just permitting another agency to control I wonder the true answer to this question is to my opinion that there are two opposing spirits in the world today at work now there can't be no more than two two heads and one of them is the holy spirit at work the other one is the spirit of the devil and in the last days in deception he said the two Spirits one of them God's Holy Spirit and the other one's the devil's Spirit working in deception the people of the Earth are now making their choice the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for Christ he is doing it by vindicating his Word of Promise to her for this age showing that it is Christ he said if the finger is supposed to move in this age the finger will move am he said if the fot is if the foot is supposed to move in this age the foot will move if the eye is to see in this age the eye will see he said the spirit of God as it as it's growed into the full stature of God in the age that we're now living He said the holy spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour and the Holy Spirit is doing this so that the people that believe God will be called out of this chaos the devil's Unholy spirit is here calling his church by the error as usual by the perversion of the word of God like he did at the beginning see it coming right back to that seed time again from Eden here it is again and I was I was listening to this man I you know brother Brown talks about you know has God lost control or is there another one that's in control and you know this man was was speaking on on Free Will and he was and he was speaking about you know everybody talks about God's in control and all of this and and he's like well you know all of this has to go back to to Free Will and you know it's like God built a box and he just put these parameters up and then he just dumped everything in this box and he shook it up and then he just let it go and he stand there trying to figure out what's going to take place next and it's like well you know brother said he said you wouldn't run your business like that he said God didn't run his business like that and it's like you know how much you know because if if we actually have this kind of concept we have this kind of belief in God that he do you know God doesn't know everything everything is not ordered of the Lord there's not a divine order to everything then exactly how much does God know I mean because if God doesn't know everything if God doesn't have full control of everything and knows what's knows the end from the beginning he knows everything that's ever going to happen to you he's going to know where everywhere every step every misstep every mistake you've ever made and he's already got an attonement made for that because he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world so if all of this isn't laid out then exactly how much does God know how much has God got in control because if he don't have it then exactly how much can we put our confidence in him because if he don't know then how are we supposed to I mean what are we supposed to do let's just all eat drink and be married cause tomorrow we die but you know it's so amazing because people actually will listen to this why because that is that is the perversion that Satan has in people's mind that he has created this perversion that all he wants to do is tear down and he want and he wants to make all this confusion that everybody doesn't well there there are no absolutes there's there's nothing to stand on it's just all wishy-washy there's nothing no God has a plan there is there is absolutes there is there's a because there is something solid because it's the word of God the word of God is solid he won't change God God said I change not I am God and I change not if he ever had one thought he will always have that thought you can't change God's mind he already knows what's going to take place and so that's that is where we put our confidence today that we don't have to worry about what's going to take place tomorrow or any other time because you know just like brother bam was speaking of you know he said if I knew that the the Lord was coming in the morning he said I would just go ahead and plant potatoes I just go to work I just go on and do everything like I was going like a just like a regular day if I knew the Lord was coming why because that is what God wants me to be doing because I'm up and doing the things that I'm supposed to be doing not waiting on thinking that something's going to change so just get up go to work all the things that you got to do go to school get ready and just go through because you're going to meet the Lord but you know what you live your life the way you're supposed to live it and everything that you do is to honor God and in the scripture here in Proverbs 19:21 the scripture tells us it says there are many devices in a man's heart nevertheless the counsel of the Lord that shall stand now there's a couple of uh uh translations here one of them is a uh is a a modern version I can't remember what it was but it says we may make a lot of plans but the Lord will do what he has decided and the another translation says people may make all kinds of plans but the Lord's will is going to be done so it doesn't matter what what goes on or what happens or all the plans that we make God's plan God's word God's will is what's going to take place that's all that matters because you know we can make a lot of plans but you know we can't change what's going to take place because you know I uh you know Adam and I we were we went to uh Alabama over the weekend and and Monday night we were coming home and I thought we was going to be home well we got home about Tuesday Morning our truck the water pump went out in the truck and I was stuck on the side of I20 for about 3 three and a half hours but you know what I didn't expect that happened and I didn't want it to happen but you know what it happened and so you know what you just have to deal with it well you know what it' been nice to know ahead of time it was going to go out because you know what it's like well I know that my water pump's going to go out so I'm just going to go put it in the shop and have it replaced but you know what that other one that they put on there it could have failed too there's there's because nothing that manmade is foolproof so I mean you know but the thing is is you know the Lord took care of us we got home and you you get out on the on the side of the road at night and you know there's a lot of uh people that are a little bit off you know you never know who's going to come along and visit you but I mean there's people out there and that's all they're looking for is somebody that um try to pray on something somebody I don't know maybe maybe when I got out of the truck maybe people just realized that they didn't want to mess with me they just it's like you know I don't I don't know I don't know how how hard it would be to overtake him so I'll just go find somebody else that's smaller yeah but you know the Lord takes care of us we don't we don't know what's going to take place we don't know what what tomorrow holds but We Know Who Holds Tomorrow we know what's going to take place and see all we got to do is put our trust in him because even in in the Book of John he said when when Jesus was speaking you know because he was speaking of him coming in the word he said when the spirit of Truth is come he said he will lead you and guide you into all truth so he has a plan for you so there is a plan and and see these things that that he said he will lead you and guide you and he said the things that you hear you'll hear these things because he said and he will show you things to come so he wanted so he he was telling the disciples this is what's going to take place see there's a so we have the spirit of God to lead us to show us these things we don't know what's going to take place but it's a stepbystep process we don't know all things but he knows all things but you know in the right time he's going to show us what we need to know he's going to lead us and guide us and show us the steps that we need to take and you know when when people say well the condition that the word world is in well you know what none of it took God by surprise you know God's not God's not worried God didn't just uh wake up one morning and and see the the whole world in chaos he already knew what was going to take place he he already had everything worked out he had an answer for every problem before the problem ever got here so everything was already laid out and and so when when he come and set all these things in motion he knew what was going to take place because when when he came out as as Elohim in the beginning self-existing and he began to speak the word and he said let there be and let there be and let there be you know what he wasn't surprised when things come into existence and he didn't he wasn't surprised when everything worked exactly the way he had it because exactly what was in his mind came into fruition and then he began to watch those things swirl and everything come into existence before there before there was an atom or a molecule or anything he already had a divine order for all of it and all of a sudden it became into the existence and he done exactly the way that God had in his mind when he spoke it into existence see can to do that and so there was there was nothing out of cater and then you know he be brother B said when he was self-existing Elohim he said the first thing that that I believe that he created was angels and he created angels and then you know we know that Lucifer and the Angels were all created well you know here here he is in this in this masterpiece that he begins to create and and put everything in order when he began to do this you know here he is and he creates Lucifer and brother M says that you know he said Satan and he said Satan was just like him except he wasn't a Creator but he was just like him you know at the same level he had everything and he like wow you know what you know if I was going to pick an enemy I would want somebody I could put under my thumb I wouldn't want anybody that was real tough you know that had anything you know I just want him to be the weakest little fell around but you know what he s somebody that was formidable that's right you know he just he just didn't have some pushover but you know what he was created yes sir and you know what even though even though he you know he he had this great power in his mind I'm going be like the most high you know I'm going to exalt myself and you know I'm going to do all these great things and you know he he tried to take the angels from you he took a third of the angels and you know he tried to do all these things and you know I'm going overcome Michael and and God and all those things and you know he he had a plan in a that he was going to but you know none of that could come to pass because because see Satan doesn't realize but he is but as being a cre a created being part of creation he is bound because the law of creation exists over him so that law that he is under is still going to hold him into that place no matter what he does he's still going to go to the place that God created for him but he said he said how art thou fallen from Heaven Lucifer son of the morning see he said he said thou was created perfect until iniquity was found in you amen see it wasn't God done that but he was that was his choice and by his choice he came into that place and now because of the law of God because of the law of all of God's word all of creation all of God's plan there is a law to that so because he turned the word down because he got out of his position and thought I'm I'm going be I'm going exalt myself over the stars of heaven I'm GNA be higher than God greater than God well then guess what he's going to the lowest pits he's got a place in in the Lake of Fire but that's his choice not anybody else's choice but see he's still Bound by that and even today God because who he is because the scripture tells us Romans 13 says he said let every soul be subject under the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of God so we know by the scripture that even though that Satan has a power that he can operate in and he's he's contrary to God but he still has but he's still Bound By The Law of God amen he can only do so much see we see that in the life of Job when when God when when God was speaking to to the devil and he came and he said you know he said have you considered my servant job when he when he began to talk about and he began to see the life of Job and what the kind of person that job was and he's like well you know is it off or not because You' got a hedge around him see the thing is is as as Satan had walked through the Earth and seen the man that job was and then all of a sudden he's like well you know what he only does that because what you've done for him and he didn't realize God knew what kind of person job was because he knew that he would stand the test amen see he knew what was going to take place and that's the reason he brought him to sign and he's like well he said well let me get a hold of him have at him and he began to work on Joe but you know what the man that job was the Integrity that job had see God knew what kind of man job was amen and he came through that and so it's the same way with you and I God has ordained us to this day God God has brought us to this time see brother BR said when he was speaking there in in Christ the mystery and he was talking about you know God had a a plan and and a purpose something that he wanted to achieve he had this thought in his mind of what he was going to take place and he you know he laid it all out just perfect what was going to take place and you know he set everything in order he said in order for him to be expressed he wanted to express himself he wanted he wanted the world to see he wanted to have fellowship and you know all the things that he wanted to express he he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a Healer he wanted to be a father all these things that he wanted to be see he was able to do all of those things and he set everything in motion and see it praise God that if God set everything in motion then there's a plan and a purpose for all of it and see we wake up this you know in the morning and you know oh what's going to take place and wor you know what God's not worried God's God's not frustrated amen you know because God know why because everything is working just just to God's plan and when you know that all all these things and and so when you see all that God had this whole plan of what was going to take place and everything's working just to that plan and then you know when we see how the the world has has come about and we know that Adam and Eve was going to fall God said everything up and all of a sudden here here they came and you know they disbelieve God's word but you know he already had a plan he already had an atonement before that ever happened the Lord and you know and and so because you know here he was in in the midst of all this and here here's Adam and Eve falling away and and all of a sudden here they are caught in caught in their in their sin and realizing you know their eyes are open and they realize they're naked and and all these things and all of a sudden you know they realize we're out of fellowship with God we're not where we are supposed to be we're not where we used to be and all this and then all of a sudden in the in the midst of all this here comes God walking in the midst of the garden calling Adam Where Art Thou see he began to call out to Adam because he knew that Adam was going to do that but he already had an atonement and he began to call out to Adam ask where are you he's over there in the bushes trying to make fig leaves trying to cover up amen and you know what none of that's going to work why because nothing that you do are is ever going to amount to anything it's not going it's not going to be able to cover you that's it but you know what God brought the covering to them when he brought the bloody lamb skins into them and had them put those on and covered them and he sent them out but he made a way and he made a promise of what was going to take place that he had that he had an way made see that he knew that they were going to have there would have to be one that had to come to cover that Chasm to bring them back into Fellowship but you know what he never forgot them and he already had the way made so here they are and all these type things when when God was coming through and seeing all these things see when you see this plan how God had everything in in divine order everything worked out just perfectly that that you know God never been was not caught by surprised by anything no that's right amen when he seen all these things take place but you know as he began to go through time and you know man got away from God and you know he he kept trying to reach out to man and have fellowship with him even when Adam and Eve were outside the garden but you know he still loved them and he still wanted to have fellowship with them and he began to deal with them amen and he began to deal with Cain and Abel you know because he he made a way for them and he began to speak to them and tell them listen there's a there's an attonement that needs to be made and he began to deal with Abel by revelation of what that needed to take place that he could come in to Divine fellowship with God that there was a there was something that had to be done and you know it said by Revelation Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than Cain why because God began to deal with Abel on what had to be done there was a revelation that was given to him and as he began to deal with it then you know what he took a hold of God's word by what God had given him and he began to do that and he took and he realized that it took blood it wasn't it wasn't any fruit or anything that was going to take place but it had to have a spot perfect lamb that had to be sacrificed and he went out there and he found one and he and he went out there and just as sincere he built that Altar and he stood before God and he took that Lamb's s and he stood there and offed and worshiped God standing there realizing that lamb was taking his place he walked in exactly what God wanted him to do and as as he began to do that you know here Here Comes we know the story here come Cain standing there offering the best of the field you know all all that his hands had done and you know God didn't off didn't accept any of that because it didn't match didn't match the plan but you know he began to deal with Cain he began to speak to K listen none of this is going to work but he told him he said listen if you will do as your brother amen all you got to do is what your brother done your brother your brother has offered a lamb and he said if you'll just do the exact same thing he said you'll be accepted amen he said but if not send lies at the door just a s just a simple fact when it's when it's when it's so simple and it and it's laid out so perfectly before us just like it was to Cain and it's like well the question is is what are you going to do with it it's your choice and there he was well you know I'm not I'm not going to do that oh it's it's just too hard this not this this just hurts my feelings like well how wonderful it is that God speaks to us just like it done just like he done Cain answered answered his question exactly G him exactly what he had need of but you know the question is is was he going to follow what God wanted him to do and so you know when when he turned it down then you know he was rejected of God Amen but that was his choice not God's choice because God began to deal with him and plead with him and not only pasted him but all of men he began to deal with them but you know what they turned they turned God down it wasn't God turning them down amen that's right you know I was thinking of you know brother brandham always talking about uh you know people saying well brother brandham you know I don't agree with you on your Doctrine and I don't agree with this and you know we're just going to draw you outside of our Circle and he said that's all right I'll just draw you back in you know the thing is is just just like when God was there you know you deal with people and you try to show them the truth and you try to show them love but you know you can't force people into doing things you know because there comes a time you've got to make a choice for yourself you've got you've got to come beyond all all of your your hurt feelings and and different things in your life you've got to move beyond all of that and because people people will always find an excuse somehow that's going to hold you back right but you know God will always deal with you and you know many times in our lives we've had God deal with us and you know and and it's only well I'm just going to speak for myself tonight but it's by but it's just being stubborn because you know you you want to do it your own way and God begins to deal with you about things and you know what because maybe maybe y'all don't have that problem but y'all just pray for me but you know we but I you know you you realize God's dealing with you and he's trying to get you to go in a certain way and he keeps trying to show you but you know what you don't want to do it that way because we think oh I got it all under control I can do this I got it until it all falls apart till the wheels fall off and then was like oh Lord where you at see and it's like well you know what I was been here waiting on you try to tell you which way to go you don't want to listen that's but see God has a plan and a purpose for everything he had everything set out just perfect you know even from the beginning all things went work just the way he had a plan you know you even you see how how the Earth and and when he created the heavens and the stars and everything works just perfectly you know and then you know how we see you know you can measure U distance and and the years and the months and all these type things and they keep perfect timeing you know brother talking about you know we can't build a clock that holds time like the stars do you know they can see and and they can track you know a hundred years from now they'll know where all the planets are where the constellations are all these type things they know what's going to take place because they see because all of this was set in order and there's a there's a perfect plan to this well you see how all of this works that when you see how all of this works in a perfect in a perfect harmony well you know when you go back because because God's plan is so perfect that the way it works that you know when when they went back in time and they were trying to figure out why there was missing time why didn't their models work right and you know the NASA and the different ones like there's a there's problem here we can't figure this out well what what happened was like oh well you know what we just go right to the Bible what yeah yeah move the sun yeah man pray to have the Sun move back 10 degrees Joshua prayed that the sun would stand still then all of a sudden well you know that's just a fairy tale there's no scientific proof to any of that because you know what it was just it was just a bunch of gases out somewhere and they just ignited and all this just come out just a big bang and it just kind of rolled around for for thousands millions of years all this stuff kind of just rolled around and burn up and we just seen all of this whoy going on and all of a sudden life came out of that then all then then you see all you know out of out of all this chaos all all of all this all this chaos all of a sudden order came amen praise the Lord as brother as brother erne used to to say all the time he said if you believe in a Big Bang Theory he said you believe that you can throw a a a bomb in a print shop and come out with a a dictionary but see the problem is is it was in divine order the problem is is we don't see the divine order until somebody begins to point out the divine order to show us the things that take place amen and it's like well all the all you know because they're out trying to find some way to prove their Theory and we can't we can't prove it because we don't we don't have any scientific proof but but you know what it it it's what we believe and so you know don't say anything against it because when as you begin to show the evidence and you begin to express all these things will you tell me how all these things work how is it how is it that what what came first the chicken or the egg but you got to have a chicken here before an egg come because you can't create an egg without the without the chicken there's no way but it wasn't created so how did how did all these things take place how is it how is it that well the scripture tells us you know the seas are all set in in order and everything's in a divine order and everything's set but you know you go into places in the world and you know what the oceans don't cross each other they don't mix the Pacific and the Atlantic don't mix there's a dividing line when when brother Brandon was talking about the the waters were created and he put He put a divine order there and then he would began to talk about to watch and and he said and instead of things flooding and and different things changing he said there was a watchdog put in the a guy he said it's called the moon and that moon was set in order and he said that controls the seas because the Seas can't but go certain places because it's a divine order amen and so when you see all these things you know it's just not just it just had ha you just happened just halfhazard but when you begin to you look at it say well how did all these things take place and you see all of these things how they work everything works in a in a in a perfect condition amen everything works just perfect and you know all things you you look at the composition of the Earth how much water how much land all of the minerals and everything is in the right proportion in the earth everything is made just exactly right right the Earth is the Earth is the right size it has the right Mass it has the right gravitational pull it's the correct distance from the sun when you see all these well you know what it just it just happened we you know if if you if you have that kind of Faith well just jump in your car crank it and expect to get in the house no because there there takes a divine order to that amen you know if you if you want to get home tonight you better have your hand on the wheel you better be having your eye on the road you better know what you're doing well see it's the same way with God God has a plan and a purpose he has everything in order and there's a law how everything works and so we don't have to worry about those things all we got to do is realize God's in control and if we can just trust God then he can move these things in the right in the right areas amen see when God began to speak about all these things and you know when he when he called man and man got out of position but you know he called uh men the prophets he called them to to bring the word because he wanted his word brought to the people and you know he began to call the prophets and he began to speak to them and he began to open them and you know because brother R said they had to be yielded to the spirit they had to be yielded and it was not what they were speak what their thoughts that they were speaking but they had to be yielded to the spirit for him to speak and as he began to speak and he he was speaking of Moses and different ones where where they began to speak the word and they began to speak the word because God wanted to deal with man he wanted to have fellowship and he reached out and he began to speak to these to these people you know and all of a sudden you know here here's these peculiar men that began to speak and and God began to open up the scripture and began to speak to them began to deal with them and show them the way that God had for them and the way that he wanted them to go and you know they didn't even understand sometimes what they were saying right it wasn't it wasn't their idea wasn't but God began to speak to them and he began to open the scripture to them and he began to speak to them and he began to show the people because he began to reveal himself through the through the prophets and you know because you know they didn't even have their own understanding of things of why but you know it's just like all they could do is just take God at his word who was it who was it Isaiah that you know he just he just went out there and walked around naked for three years or whatever it was you know and it's like why because you know what I'm showing y'all that this is the condition y'all living in and see this is this is what God sees before it you know he began to speak to them and and you know here they are and and even even when they didn't want to speak they couldn't hold back they couldn't hold back what they wanted to say as Jeremiah said you know he said it's like fire shut up in my bones and he said you know he was weary for forbearing you know he just trying to hold on but you know he had to get out and say this here brother said you know he said God God has spoke and he said and I must deliver it see he could he couldn't get away from that whether whether they liked it or not no matter what happened to them that's what God wanted them to do because he began to speak to them he said God God has spoke in my in his heart and he must he must say it he said not to be different but to be obedient right so he had to he had to go and speak all these things and say everything in order what God wanted them to know because there was there was he began to reveal himself and he wanted them to know who he was and and what he wanted them to do but you know as as he began to reach out there was a lot that turned him down oh yeah and you know even when it came to the time of Moses when he began to deal with and see the sin that was in the earth and you know he told him but he made a way but when he sent Noah into the Earth and told him said listen there's a flood coming there's judgment coming and you can make your way out right but there's a way that you got to follow when he preached when he preached to his generation that 120 years out there building an ark and and preaching to them listen God's judgment's coming and there's a there's a plan and there's a way out but you've got to get ready you've got to prepare yourself and he began to preach to them this whole time and he began to build this Ark and he said the whole time he was stand out there and they could prove that there was no water in the sky well there ain't no there ain't no water up there we we got this crazy man out here but God had it all set in order and he began to build all this well there might be something to it but I would I wouldn't get too close to any of that but all of a sudden next thing you know when he spent all those years out there building that Ark getting ready so well we ain't we ain't seen nothing but didn't build that Ark and he keep saying the same thing all these years but it didn't take long all of a sudden something Supernatural happened all of a sudden them animals started you know what he didn't have to go out there and he wasn't wrangling the animals and trying to hurt them onto the ark you know he wasn't out trapping animals trying to get them on on the ark but you know what because the animals were smarter than the people in that day because the because the same spirit that spoke to those people in that day are the same ones that led those animals onto the ark right and here they are coming two by two or coming in groups of seven and came onto the ark and when all of that was finished after they saw all that so like well you know all the all the news stations are out there we got to watch this phenomenon look at this all these animals are coming and they all just stand around watching well I wonder what's going to happen next but nobody took it seriously right nobody believed it what they didn't realize that God shut the door and had sealed it amen and he sealed their judgment but that was their choice amen God had already made a way for them and they turned it down that was their choice yes amen and all of a sudden after well it's been one day two days three days y'all see anything different nope have youall heard from Noah nope do you know what after that week went past they started having this phenomenon all of a sudden it's like what is all this oh guess what Noah's prophecy come to a pass Noah's word is coming to pass then all of a sudden when the rains came down so hard you couldn't see anything everything began to get washed way there was no place to hide then all of a sudden it's like hey can we get in the ark Noah nope amen your judgment's already upon you y right and you don't realize it amen and all of a sudden I didn't close the door God did God closed the door but you had your opportunity and you let it pass by that's right see that's what we've got to do we've got to take the word when the word is presented to us we've got to grab a hold of it and walk in the word that he's given us and realize this is life and death you know we're not pro nobody's promised tomorrow nobody knows what's going to take place but you know now is the day of today is the day of salvation today is the day if you're going to listen to God if you're going to get a hold of God get right with God whatever you need is today's the day to do it because we don't know none of us have our promise tomorrow right see brother brandom said when he began to speak about this word and these prophets began and speak the word and here they began to walk in that and they began to speak the word and they and it said the word he said God had so much control of them he said that their voice and their and their actions he controlled everything he began to speak to them and then he said he said give me a church that's so complete Anointed with god Till every action and move is thus sayith the Lord he said walk in that shakina of Glory I'll show you a messiah he said anointed one standing upon the Earth see if we walk in the word that God has given to us see now's the time to do that God has called and now's the time to do that amen oh you know we you know because the the world is full of of of Deceit amen see God said everything in this perfect order and everything works just so so perfect but you know what now in this time when when God sent the word and he's and he's Vindicated the word but you know what Satan had a plan also Satan was always trying to work against God's plan always from the beginning amen surely you'll not die well we don't have to listen to that we've got our own way God's not God's not surely God wouldn't do that God's a good God that won't happen but you know what it came just like he said it would it did amen you see he allowed Satan to have his his time to work things the way he wanted and so it's just like that tonight you know God allowed Satan to work his plan and he began to work and we see it all the way down through history we see how everything took place and everybody's like well you know why why did God allow this to happen and why did God allow that to happen why because there's a divine order to it all you know you know you see how God began to deal with all of them and and began to allow began to speak to all these people all the way down began to speak all of the prophets began to speak to them and he began to show them things and and express himself and he began to show himself in Miracles and and the supernatural things that that took place but you know people didn't understand those things people didn't believe it but you know when all of that word was preached there came one that came upon the Earth yeah that it was stepped into the Fulfillment of all of that we know Jesus Christ stepped into the Fulfillment of all the word that was preached he was the Fulfillment of that he came and he began to preach to the people of what what took place and he began to tell people listen I am the Fulfillment of that of the word that's been preached and he said now is the time that the lamb must be slain he said that's what I come into the Earth to do to bridge that Chasm that's from the beginning I am one just like Moses said God would raise up a prophet like an unto me and here he came and he stepped out he began to preach the word in a in a time when the people ought have known the word great religious leaders they should have known the word and here Jesus began to preach to them and show them the word and they didn't even understand and didn't even see him no and they rejected him and here he was he began to see these things and began to show them but he came to the ones that he was supposed to come to he said he came to his own and his own received him not but there was a group that received that word amen and see he came on into the Earth to fulfill the word and and all of the scriptures him standing there and showing hey nobody takes my life from me I lay it down why because that's the father's will amen and you know I come to do this and he's like listen he said when when I go away he said there a comforter must come he said I got to go away for the comforter to come he said I'm not going to leave you comfortless thank you Lord and all that they had went through and all the things that they had seen and he began to speak to the disciples and tell them listen you're going to be hated in the earth you're going to be persecuted all the things the way they treated me they'll treat you but he said I want you know he said I'll never leave you he said I'll never forsake you he said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the Earth all the things that he done all the way through he led them all the way yes amen right and told him listen I got to go I got to go to Calvary by myself the scripture says that I'll be forsaken even when Peter's like well Lord I'm not going to allow that happen but it did you know why because the scripture says that when we make plans the will of God's what's going to be done and that's what took place but you know he told he told Peter he said after after the resurrection he said listen I've prayed for you he said when you're converted strengthen the Brethren you've got a testimony Peter you've come through some things you want to know what a failure looks like as Peter but Peter the Holy Ghost is going to come upon you and you're going you're going to show show them what God can do to a failure amen when God can get a hold of somebody that's absolutely just fell apart like you know all the things that you've done you know cutting off somebody's ear getting mad all the different things but you know what God gave him a testimony and brought him through show him what Grace was and he began to speak of those things to know what God's done that we can go out there and tell you listen this same Lord Jesus is here yes to be with to meet your need if you want if you want a lifechanging experience here's one that can give you a life-changing experience am all the things that the scripture Tau Al about this Jesus whom you you crucified he's the Fulfillment of all that and he had such a testimony in the end they were like men and Brethren what shall we do hey they were so moved by that well R I'll give you the prescription repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost hey he said This Promise is unto you and to your children and to them that's a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call see all of those things as he began to come through and began to preach God was making himself known to him am 120 in in one day see all those all the way through begin to speak you know and then you you look at all through the scripture and people I don't understand why why all these things happen all these bad things happen it's the divine order of God Amen there's a plan and a purpose to all of it you know it's like when they when they said well how is it that God can sit there with his hands C folded across his stomach and watch all those babies get murdered and all those women during the Dark Ages they said well if the if the sea didn't go on the ground it couldn't come back he said if a seed must abide alone and die and wrought for it to come to life amen there was a Divine Purpose in all that amen I don't I don't understand that well you know what in the Scripture it tells us when that that the red horse rider went out and he said he was given a sword and it said and it said he he went to take peace from the earth so he began to take because he he was there to take all this but you know what God had a plan it was a divine order that was there Amen in the midst of all that because those people had the O anointing they were anointed why because they were sacrifice and you know I I I've always said you know it's when somebody wants to take something from you because they think that you're going to hold on to something that they they feel like I've got this power I'm gonna take this from you well you know how you take the power away from somebody is you give it to them when they want to take something well here I'm freely give it to you then all of a sudden they've lost the power because you give it to them so when when they out there well we're going to take our we're going to take your life we're going you know what they had a better Resurrection coming they had a they had a better testimony ahead of them why because you know what you know we're going we're going to suffer for a while we're going to go through all these heartaches and and all of this pain and all these things that are taking place but you know what we've got a better waiting you know here in just a few minutes we're going to be on the other side we just we just got to battle this for just a short period of time and all of a sudden you know what we're going to be in the presence of the Lord you know I got I got nothing to worry about if they if they kill me that's all right if they torture me that's all right because you know what I'm going into the Arms of Jesus and you know here they I walk right into this and I I'm going to the other side they were anointed for that amen and praise God you know it's like well I can't I can't understand that well that was that was the anointing for their day that's what they were called to do that's right amen and everybody had had to go through those different times everything was called every situation was made for and every time all the way down through history everything was made perfect for that time every every every time Satan came and tried to do something the spirit of the Lord raised up a standard and whatever that standard was it was perfect for that time it met it met the conditions for the day whatever whatever came about it worked out just exactly the way God wanted it to be it was just perfect everything went through and so there was no there was nothing that was out of cater there was nothing that that was out of place there was there was no problems in any of this it worked out just perfect and you know when when we see that God began to speak and in in the beginning when he began to speak and he began to say Let There be let there be and everything came into the divine order and he and he stood there and he said let us make man in our own image and everything got and he and when he saw all of creation when he saw everything that he had done he said it's good and the scripture said that he rested amen he came and he rested why because everything was set in divine order brothers and sisters I want you to know one thing tonight see God come to the place that when everything come in divine order that he rested then you know what God's not worried about what's going to take place why because it's all in divine order well let me tell you something when you come into Christ and he said he said when when you come into Christ he said he said we're we're not we are now New Creations we are new creatures in Christ Jesus the old things have passed away and all things have become new am so the old things have passed away so when you come into Christ then you under that because the promise is when you come into Christ you enter into that rest well then you know what if God came into that and he had a plan and a purpose everything was in divine order and when it came in and then he sat down and he rested because everything was working just the way God wanted it to well then let me tell you something brother sisters if we step into that same place where we're we step in divine order the same way when you come into Christ you're in divine order and you know what doesn't matter if every devil in hell comes against you when everything falls apart when there's nothing there and it all blows up and there's nothing there and you don't know where you're standing you don't know what's going on there's a place to stand why because no matter what comes your way we are blessed in the Beloved we're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and it doesn't matter what comes or goes you know what everything is in divine order all you got to do is put your trust in him and walk in the way he lead you if if you would just put your confidence in the word of God and say you know what I don't have to worry about anything why because God is in control God leads us and you know everything is made if God brought me if God Justified me if God Sanctified me if God filled me with the Holy Ghost and brought me and put me on the road that I'm supposed to be walking if I would just continue to follow the same spirit that turned me out or brought me out of the world of sin and brought me out of the depths of darkness and put me into glorious light if I can just continue to walk in that you know what I doesn't matter what comes my way doesn't matter what happens whatever comes place I'm tonight standing in divine order I'm standing in the divine plan of God and you know what I can rest solely in that I don't have to worry about anything that comes or goes why because there's a place to stand why because God wants us to realize who we are amen you don't have to worry about what's because if we see who Satan really is Satan only s only can do what God allows him to do y amen that's right am if we just put our trust in him I'm so glad that I've got a place to stand that I've got one that I can trust in God's in control you know just like when they were out on the sea and the ship was rocking and and everything looked like everything was going to fall they were ready for that boat to sink like Lord you don't care that we perish well he wasn't worried he was in the back of sleep and they were so afraid because this terrible storm was coming and he was asleep why because you know what he was at rest and no matter if we can if we have the same if we have the same Spirit if the same one that was on that boat if we were in him when he walked the shores of Galilee right if we're if we're if we're a part of him and we're all of that went on and he and he was facing all of that and he didn't have didn't have a single worry he didn't have any fear right and if if we're one of his then you know what you don't have to worry about that that's right God has a place for us it's in divine order and I hope I hope this has been a blessing to you tonight let's all stand and have the musicians come but I just I just want to share that with you tonight because you know everybody worries about well what's going to happen or this or that God's in control that's that's right I believe God's in control and if God's in control then I don't have to worry about it I am blessed let's sing that if we
