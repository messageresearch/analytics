of people in - Lord but we ask you to just have your way and bless each one remember and of our Lord SiC and just touch her and remember all the other sicknesses among us because there's many many things have your way and let your grace and love be with us in Jesus name let's go to first Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren so that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever and never we're talking about and had the thought now for quite a while of being born being born again as a process this trench you know it's in motion and will stay in motion until our bodily change comes you know and it will finish then into that chain so we're kind of move up a little bit today and kind of strike a few things but now let's go to Ephesians because we'll pick up our thought from Ephesians 1 excuse me yeah seasons 1 verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word all right now we're we've been quite a while as I was saying talking about the process of being born again that you know I believe it starts by the new birth when Christ comes into our soul and gives eternal life to that soul that that starts your process of a birth all right now even in your stature of a perfect man that you were supposed to have read to listen to the Prophet you hear him and are talking about and blasphemous name how did you birth into this birth into this birth into this now remember there's one new birth but there's many births in the basis of a growing forth because a birth means they're coming forth into that's really what it means a baby comes in to the world it's birthed into the world all right so then in the gospel in the statue of a perfect man it's supposed to be not new births you don't have seven you burst but maybe you have in manifestation or whatever you want to call it you know phases stages whatever as to looking at that and seeing that you've birthed into this then we got to be birthed got to be birthed into virtue got to be worked in a knowledge birth into temperance it means of coming forth into it means you're growing up there was a time when you was young and you was looking forward to a time boy you know that one of these days I'll have a boyfriend I'll have a girlfriend I'll have a car I'll do you looking at the stage all right but then you reach that stage so you came forth into that stage so then it's not as I say now over and over it's not seven new burrs it means that that new birth is constantly growing inside of us just as it is in the natural rim and that's why Jesus will be using see and telling Nicodemus that you must be born again alright so then it's a process taking place in our hearts in our lives and it goes all of your Christian journey as I said from the new birth and it'll go all the way to the change of the body and then we can step into eternal life fully body soul spirit everything see in that way we will be actually birthed out of this world into eternity all right now hold that point and you you'll see what we're trying to get to all right now we talked about this past Wednesday on the little message titled at sonship because I want to make sure that we understand and follow it in the right order to where that we know what we're talking about is true but don't get lost with the way that I do things I've always been this away a background more than I go forward I guess you call it because you know everything has got to have a foundation all right then it's based from that foundation it grows from that and you keep on going so just because it I back up and talk a lot about the new birth when you're wanting me to go over here into this parks you know or something just remember that's the way that I've always done it and if you were going to school today that would be the way it is what you you background right and you keep background in not you got yours in there in your natural schooling that like one is bad hard to is a lot of background of one three is hard all right then for the background that is in the natural and if you take it and think about it that's the way our Christian journey grows as Christ as revealing himself to us in our new birth right and then we're being born again coming forth into manifestation of these things all right we've been declaring for quite a while that the new birth is what makes you a child of God it's not that we were born as I were covering our Wednesday night you know a lot of the people the message they say oh I've always was eternal I always was eternal within Jesus Christ died in vain that's just the best way to say it and then do you realize that what I was trying to say Wednesday that if you hold that always was eternal and didn't don't handle it correctly you know that you're making the Bible false prophecy because when Jesus Christ died not only did he die in vain because it wouldn't accomplish anything which you make it false prophecy because he prophesied that he was going to die the Bible said he was going to die all right then if he didn't die within what would he need to die for for us all right I know what the Prophet covers those things but remember read it real careful in the roundabout of where you're reading when he says who always was eternal read real careful and see if he doesn't say it like this if you have eternal life if you have eternal life the eternal life that you receive always was eternal but there was a time I didn't have it right no that's what I'm trying to declare our to bring out to where we can understand alright so 2nd Peter declares that we must receive the new birth I hope you caught these from the life story messages because I'm trying to make a point heavily on it that Peter in second Peter is declaring the new birth making us a child of God how faith be born again alright to these that have escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust etc Peter was saying that you must start off by a new birth all right that new birth is what makes us a child of God that's why Jesus said to Nicodemus you must be born again or you cannot see understand right you cannot see or understand you can't enter the kingdom without the new birth all right so then the Prophet said that's the most important thought and to me that's an amazing point that that was Jesus's first doctrine because you must be born again and the man couldn't understand it well then you're gonna see that it would naturally turn out to be the hardest doctrine to try to preach would be you must be born again then brother Branham spent all of his life preaching on those things trying to bring it down and it just constantly kept unfolding and a deeper depth the deeper depth you know until he comes on out into finally preaches on the stature of a perfect man all right now so we see that this faith to make you to wear that you're born into the kingdom by the new birth which is the birth of the word the word you taking you hold it and God quickens that word and makes it alive giving you a new birth in your soul making your soul to eternal all right now so we know Peter in what he's describing he's describing that to us all right we went through Paul and his example of adoption showing that when you're born into the family the natural story of adoption as a child was come into the family when it's born into the family it's a child of that family all right it doesn't have to join it or either it's a part of it all right and that's what Paul was explaining how the new birth and all of the things would be the same way as Peter was explaining it all of that is explaining the new birth to bringing Christ could come and live in each one of us in the born-again experience making us the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ accepting what he's done for us and then he accepts us and brings us into the family all right now Paul as I said he uses adoption but remember now Paul is giving an example of adoption all right now listen don't get confused on this little statement see an example is not always totally um word-for-word or perfect understanding or whatever you know it's an example to bring you to the position of understanding why are you following me then see Paul is taking the example of adoption I was not saying oh yeah you always was eternal and everything and I know he's telling you that you must be born again the entire Bible is expressing that we must be born again we must be born into the family of God all right see then in doing that Paul is is covering and using adoption as an example because remember now listen you don't come into the world with eternal life oh well I always was a son I always was a son you getting into examples without having the background of understanding and thereby you are cutting yourself off from the truth all right you didn't come into the world with eternal life I don't believe that I've never taught nothing like this I don't believe the Prophet ever taught it because if he taught it that away I can't find it and I've been through all of the things and if you got any quotes you want to be brought brangham we'll talk about him and see what he's talking about all right because Jesus wouldn't have started off if he's gonna be always was eternal point Jesus would have told Nicodemus Nicodemus just believe who you are you always was a son and he didn't tell him that he said you must be born again and then it did an amazing thing as I said that Paul I mean that that Jesus that that started the the doctrine of the new birth and how that Paul and Peter them would all lay right into that imperfect understanding to try to explain the things unto us all right now both Paul and Peter were both explaining the new birth in the writings of the Bible John does it go through it I was just set another day meditating a little on the different scriptures and the things you know just kind of let your mind run sometimes and think about seeing that's why I said it's our moment ago the entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ in that wonderful so the entire Bible is declaring one thing one new birth it's declaring how you become a child of God the Bible is not declaring you always water child it's declaring how to become a child we're on sea thin by how you become a child brings you into the family of God and Paul is using that example of adoption that shows that you're naturally born into the family well I that represents your new birth the adoption of showing that you come into a natural family you were born into the family you come forth into that family all right and how many times would the Prophet say he said I was born to Branham I didn't become a brand um I was born to Brando all right that's right that's exactly right but he what he's never saying I was born to eternal so I don't need nothing no see that's where brother Branham says that I didn't I believe it was it blasphemous night where he said that that the baptism of the Holy Ghost was so missed halt so incorrectly talked because people think this is I think I said anything but see just get it simple to wear that we can look at it that the entire Bible whether it be Paul whether it be Peter whether it be James whether it be John any of the Gospels just read the Bible and as you read it that's what I was trying to emphasize from the scriptures that we've read in first Peter all right being born again and explaining the new birth then go to 2nd Peter and then he starts to growth development right I went back in Paul to pick up the collations and Paul in Galatians 3 is explaining a child born into the world or life or death and we needed to be born again then rot then Galatians 4:1 he goes into the adoption into the family by that child all right but now remember you got to get into the family right now you've got to get into the family cuz remember the natural stories on the top in it the natural story of you being born you know a collie or whatever you know not always would that's only a natural story showing you that to be that you must be born again all right now get that emphasis and hold the point it doesn't show us we always was it shows us what we need we need the new birth if we don't have the new birth we're not in the family of God all right but you see why that is so dangerous the way people preach too they just well I just felt I just read what the Prophet said he said we always was eternal amen amen that's right but it's a lot got to be understood to find out how but this remember now think on it and that's what my point the natural story is an example it doesn't always lay in the correct order of the natural to go to the spiritual the natural is a natural story all right sure you were born James Colley into the Colley family all right amen but that didn't make you a Christian you got to be born again to be a Christian you got to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and let him them come and live in us making us the children of God in the new birth all right then bringing it into the new birth it brings you a child of God all right see that's why Jesus said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom all right so if you and I are not born again I don't care what examples you use or thoughts or ideas if you don't have the new birth you're not in the family of God right see then that's the main point yeah but brother so-and-so says it with us alright you go follow brother so-and-so do what you won't do that's your business that's between you and the Lord but as far as me and my house this is the way I've always taught it and it's well I always believed it you've got to be born again to do that you go through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to bring you to the new birth all right it brings you to that new birth and that's what the disciples done that's the example always in betar in the scripture and then they received eternal life the word that they hailed was quickened unto them and that was the new birth it was not that they had the new work down through that no they didn't they had to receive the new birth it's not as you always was eternal it's you've got to be born again to have eternal life yeah but I've got this one one okay so what I'm saying you do what you want to I've just always tried to preach it to West the way that I understand it and and believing it that way you know that Jesus Christ died to release that life that it could come back in me not dying to release his life and all he went through for me to just get a knowledge that always was yes that's basically what people are teaching I always was what do I need I believe you need eternal life that's the best way that I can put it all right as I said now then Paul is giving an example of how that that baby is born into the family naturally born into the family it brings the child into the family which is what the new birth does to you and me the new birth brings us into the family of God then we need the tutors and the governor's in the end the child trainer to raise us all right we've got a lot to go we've got a lot of things to be considered but first is to get right where we're at that being born into the family of God by the new bird not just because if you go to church and believe the Prophet and everything else oh I I've got I just I just feel it I just you know people like that they just they uh well that's all right but listen this is the main point I want you now to think about the natural story of adoption shows the spiritual story of adoption the way Jesus was preaching in John 3 the natural story of adoption shows the spiritual story of adoption the natural story is what he's born into the family he was born to call you that made you in the family all right spiritually we got to know how to get into that family so it takes the new birth to get into the family of God all right now in doing that being see what I want us to think about is adoption and I've always taught it this away for ever since the beginning and I still teach it that way we'll try to get to it as much as we can this morning adoption then it has to be taught in stages alright cuz in the natural things are in stages you've come into your natural family and then they give you razors send them to school you know we do we don't have the tutors the governor's and the things that was the way they done back then they were doing and they were homeschooling we'd be more or less calling homeschooling you know all right but now think about it we must be brought into the family of God so adoption then we'll have to be taught in stages not just as one point all right that's just like the the fact of saying you're justified that's a work of the Holy Spirit you're sanctified that's the work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the Holy Spirit but it's three stages to bring us to a birth all right see they need to do those things that's why Nicodemus couldn't understand all he could taint within his natural mind well I got to go back to my mother and be born again we'll see Jesus was trying to tell if he born of water in morning and he was trying to explain to him what would it take to come into the body of Christ it would take justification by faith accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior it would take sanctification to come and cleanse the vessel and setting your side then it would take the coming of the holy spirit into your soul to make your soul eternal bringing you eternal life alright see then the new birth is in stages so then don't think it would stop just because you get born again that's what I said want to go your birth into this you burped into that you just keep on being burnt as these things come forth we've got to be birthed into the virtues and not only birth into the virtues we've got to be sealed see then there's no way itself why I've always emphasize to you you said well brother Dale I'm not working on these things down here I'm working on brotherly kindness I think I work on brother well what are you gonna do if you get it you got to seal these in to come up you got to build a pyramid to come on by sensible if you just look at it it's fine to deal with brotherly kindness go that's a wonderful thing but remember the very first thing you need in your Christian life is virtue now I'll tell you this to wear you to be used to it or or get to it what is it see where is it which is what does the scriptures in Galatians where we talk about the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace goodness me all right works for the flesh you know is this that now the fruits of the spirit fruits of the Spirit is the same thing as the virtues right you see what I'm talking about all these scriptural tie together the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace goodness meekness now in Christ Jesus because it's taking on his divine nature all right so the entire Bible is trying to get us to see a growth development and to try to get us to coming into manifestation of Jesus Christ into our hearts and our lives all right now see then putting the new birth let's start with that and just get the top because let's let's go ahead with number one brothers and we'll read it now this is a lot of readings so just buy with it but I want you to see that adoption now listen Paul said we read there that we're predestinated unto adoption all right now how does God predestinate by foreknowledge he predestinate all right now so he knew that everybody would not be on the same level right so now here's the point when we get over a little bit in the message I'll back up and repeat it but here's the thought see in the adoption you'll find your new birth you find growth development and then you find the change of the body all using the same word adoption but remember it's in stages you can't put the change of the body up here you've got to grow into the change of the body you case what I said you can't just say well I don't need to work on these other others work on brotherly kindness well now you got a seal in all of these things before your brotherly kindness can be of any affect to you right because I'm the one not the one that said it you're supposed to register to a perfect man maybe they encourage you to read it over and over because he speaks of being birthed into this into this into this he speaks of how the mortar shields us together by the Holy Spirit as it seals in virtue all right see then you got to come into knowledge and knowledge has to be played that it's sealed in like I said then you can jump up and seal in brotherly kindness you gotta wait until you get now he said that's where your chain breaks at the weakest link so if you said well I just get to brotherly kindness I don't need these other look at you weakly standing before you you've done missed a whole thing all right but now let's just look at the Spitzer's cuz we're going to look at the basis that Paul is covering to the Romans all right the three stages of the adoption let me stake this to you then listen adoption then we'll be in stages so we have to go through each stage okay now but adoption is it it's like I'm trying to find a word maybe I'm just reading the scriptures and one but it's adoption is set to work you can have one thing and you could be predestinated to just be born again are you following me coach Paul said your predestinated unto adoption see now we grab a dachshund we throw it way up here we go here we go that would now go easily go to the point of seeing that you're adopted into the family by the new borough all right then go to the manifestation of the sons of dark daughters of God the making known from Romans 8 that will read ensuring that that's another stage of adoption and a lot of people are predestinated to that stage with some that was predestinated and just be born again that's as far as they'll ever go and they'll die in that stage and they'll be with some are predestinated to go to higher greater depth of the word and that's their life but then finally somebody's going to be predestinated to the adoption to wit the redemption of the body so now remember adoption then is going to be in stages three of them want to be your new birth want to be your authority or what you want to call it the next is the change of the body because that's what Paul taught in Romans all right but remember the point you always start that's what I spent a whole message Winston I'd hit it a little bit and I'll come up and then I'll back up the whole message Wednesday was what statue of a perfect man shows you got to be born again and then growth development Paul shows you got to be born into the family adopted into the family and then you start a growth development all right she's showing that they're doing the same thing all right now watch what we're seeing here in Romans and if Christ be in you the body is dead because sin with the Spirit is life because of righteousness God now you need a new birth you need to know you're gonna have to get a bird we'll come on down to it in a minute but it's the spirit now this if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you a promise this is that your new birth you're being born again it's gonna go all the way to the chains of the body well it's kind of like what I've always said so you say well brother Dale I'd like to get this change this old body cause mine's wearing out all right brother branham how do we get these virtues remember the message message of Malachi 4 luke 1730 revelation 10 7 I'm gonna do two things turn the hearts of the children back to the Father reveal the thunders which were revelations hanging in the seventh seal 327 church age book right he told us how to get to that he's told us how to get to the change in the body Paul was telling us how to get to the change of the body but he just couldn't make it manifest right he could come up into the authorities and the manifestations and time but he could not come into the change of the body so he could only prophesy change of the moment in among the twinkling of an eye more to put on immortality he brought it all because that way brother Branham didn't have to come and bring something new he just took us back to what they were saying called Paul is telling us how the body is to be redeemed you want to know how the bodies be redeemed read the Apostle Paul corruptor put on incorruption Morrel put on immortality he's explaining all the way to the change of the body but it was not time for it to happen because it was predestinated for Paul to reach a certain position but then he had to die and go by the grave right remember our predestination is by foreknowledge not God's desire but by foreknowledge that he knows what we will do he knows whether or not you'll accept Jesus Christ as your Savior or whether you'll accept brother so-and-so that said I always was eternal like I've always told you men told us when we were seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost one not this brother and the message oh he told us he said there's three of us and it was he said I believe all three of y'all receive the baptism the Holy Ghost will you know those two brothers both of them put their basis of their baptism of the Holy Ghost upon what he said mm-hmm I knew I didn't get it and I didn't put it on it you know what both those brothers is Baxley at this day or whatever you don't call it well you shouldn't be why not it was the truth they put theirs on what he said I put mine up on the word and what God had done and was doing in my life all right so now listen it'll quicken see this new birth that you receive this spirit that raised up Jesus Christ if it comes and dwells in you then he that raised him up will come and quicken even these mortal bodies quick enough to the basis of shocking him to life now like brother George canadough nati like that quickening because that was you know he he had that thought in him you can call it quickening brother George would the spirit would strike him and he he jerk you know because that was that was quickening to him and that's what it means quickening it'll quicken it right now it makes you live right makes you to come to church makes you do the things what justice in your new birth just your new birth is supposed to quicken these bodies but it'll go all the way to the chains okay now therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh you'll die but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body will live this grow in Christ on for as many as are led by the Spirit of God and look they are the sons of God if you're led by the Spirit of God if you're born again you're a son of God for you have received not the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption that didn't say adoption that didn't it still out the word adoption it's the spirit of adoption so you're gonna start with the spirit of adoption phase one is a new birth spirit of adoption that's that Holy Spirit that comes in you in the new birth that's the spirit of adoption then you can go on to adoption right come on now listen to what he's saying where you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear which you receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father we have a father when we receive that new birth we have a father he's my father I love that don't you I love to call him father see I never had a father my dad died when I was about four years old so I really never had that point so but I know who my real father is he's my real father okay now look proven this new birth stage-1 proving it look at what Paul says the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God what's inside comes outside right now the Spirit of God two enormous shows in the soul that there's something right aren't now listen any children I love this one then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together what about errors enjoy our errors is to receive something somebody has that can give it to you as an air of an inheritance or whatever you want to cover it but what about join tires now watch join heirs with Christ well no no no no no no no that that's going this little bit too far now that brother Dale oh now now now back up a little bit how we gonna be join tires with Christ that's what he said that's what he said so that's up to God to prove it to do it somebody's got to be join tires when ours means if you inherit just exactly what Ian heard and you know that Jesus Christ had to inherit eternal life in the play come on wait she's been on that for a long time ago Jesus Christ had to inherit eternal life in flesh because he was not born with eternal life in his flesh so he inherited it where is our inheritance from the father what about inheriting eternal life so somebody's got to die to get that eternal life okay let's go I thought I'd be short today but all right we'll go well I reckon it's the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory we shall be revealed in us now there's more to come right there's a whole lot more to come now remember what we're doing adoption in stages a stage one is your nuber the spirit of adoption now we're going to read second stage goes into manifestation of sons and daughters of God then we'll go down to where that will cover the change of the body all in Romans wrote about them didn't have to come and give us a new Bible he come to return us back to them there's he faith of the fathers that people do teach I'm going back in the seventies you heard a lot about faith of the fathers and things like that but then adjust all whole we're aware I'll raise what is eternal we're up here we don't need death we don't need that well anything that God has that you don't need I'll be glad to take ok did you listen if you don't want it and it belong to God let me have it cuz I won't everything and I want to be join tires with Jesus Christ he inherited eternal life by coming the way that he I mean in flesh now just covered it by and coming in flesh you know he inherited eternal life in flesh why because he gave up the life he gave all of that to pay the price for me and you well why so we could get eternal life in our soul the new birth and could inherit a right of adoption now did he get a change come on did Jesus Christ get a change of the body his body was made eternal not that it was a sinner no but because it was natural birth it was a physical element it had a beginning so then he had to receive eternal life and that's lesson and he did it the resurrection and the change well I thought that's what we're supposed to do I just want my inheritance right and if you don't want it just let me have it alright okay listen for I reckon then we say oh but we're in trouble and why I will oh wow the new wounds they were brother Forney you know we're so troubled with this and troubled with that if we were Christians have you ever had that toad in your face I've had it throw it in my face people say if we were where we thought we were they'd be more signs and wonders you know what the reason was I was looking at it oh I was looking at the reason that it wasn't happening but I'm nice I don't try to be so arrogant and hateful and say you're the causing it because I know and realize we're all the causing it we just not believe in what God says we're not laying everything upon what he said we're trying to a figure it out and what for the earnest expectation of the creature which is natural creations and ever so in other words the animals and every time right the whole creation whole creatures animals and all is waiting for what waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God now the whole world is waiting animals and all the whole everything waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God have you ever looked at what brother and said manifest means to make no manifest means to make known don't worry about it I've preached this for 40 years I can give it to you by memory but what about all four paragraph 28 adoption 1965 18 with earnest expectation the whole creation is waiting for the manifestation see the manifestation what is manifestation making known making known what are you looking for in adoption brother Dale God to make known his children his sons and daughters because I like it this away cousins we have always appreciated you know what may God honor brother Branham no come on unquote we he said he laid so close to God to make the gift work got a quote come on some of you don't know that's a quote but not I was shaking head yes you know it is he said he laid so close to God till he made to give four you know what he was doing he was making God known why did brother Branham stop letting all louisville preachers get up there and preach and him pray for the sick maybe they wouldn't they brain did exactly the way he wanted the come on him a ride in his early ministry they preached and he done this praying but then he started preaching and a lot of times no praying what was he doing making god known you won't something to happen in your life just make God known and he'll make you known that's what he done with the Prophet the Prophet made him known for the word and God made the Prophet known by signs and wonders because that's what manifest means to be manifestation of the sons of God you know the whole world's waiting on that now that's Ricci Bible the whole world is waiting on the manifestation of sons and daughters have gone you know what I love I've always preached this way and I love it when that bull got up and charged that prophet we were listening the other night this was the thing and he said love come in his heart and he said boy I'm sorry said you go lay down tuku lay down I'm sorry the bull of stopped what about the Hornets what about the things you know that nature met its master for a minute didn't ever think like that for a minute nature made its master that bull just went lay down he walked by him and went on he had made God known that's it right the way he preached he said now I've tried my best to make God known to you so now let's see if God will make known who he is and come with signs and wonders so what is adoption adoption is first what the new birth gives us the new birth brings us into the family of God by the new birth giving us eternal life all right what's the second stage of adoption you can call it authorities and call it manifestations you can call it one because that's what the world's waiting on all right come on read it for the creature was made subject to vanity why because we fail the creature of the creation everything was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who have subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God what do you think there's going to happen when the whole world thing of the animals and everything sees that love of God well that was only for the profit you do what you want what a big man said one time he said at third poles only for brother branham and the Lord Jesus well brother branham said the third pole was for the bride and the sinners never which one what do you second for the it was for the bride and religious people and to the totally lost now that's what he said what you see everybody this world's runner so what so said it well I just believe it you might have to read what brother so-and-so says you might find out they're not reading it okay because the creature itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God now watch for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now why because they're waiting on the manifestation of sons and daughters of God you just think now I've had this in my mind for 40-something years but I'll keep it there because it would throw you into the wrong channel you realize the whole world is waiting on you and me that's gonna have to be a certain time certain times sure we know it it'll be short huh but it'll be there so that's as far as I won't say it because that's just something that the Lord's always showed me and and he brings it back every once in a while know this okay cuz it's gonna be just a short time look don't look for a world wide sweeping revival remember you know what we've sitting there listening advice not to him talking know what I was reading in the scripture the reason the prophets message you know brother Brennan said there would be a said there's a world wide sweeping revival going on right now he was talking about in his ministry and it was this message has went around the world but not a world wide sweeping revival like they had but it's here and it'll manifest itself but look we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now waiting on the sons and daughter had gone all right now watch it Paul where are you at Oh where are you at and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits adoption first age even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for what waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body to wit means to understand you've got other meanings for the word wit but to wit is to understand do you realize then that's exactly scripture to understand the redemption of the body by somebody before it's ever made manifest because remember the dead in Christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain shall be changed the last part of adoption comes as a change of the body alright did you get it did you catch on to what I'm saying the whole world everything is waiting on the bride of Jesus Christ they without us Hebrews eleven forty cannot be made perfect everything is waiting on the bride yeah but where what no I saw aren't you waitin whatever you want to wait you just do what you want to but remember it's waiting on the bride to realize who she is and what she's here for but see that's what I said we go after what everybody else has to say about it the same brother that made that big statement of saying our minute to go back to third pool he also said he said all these things was for Jesus not us and brother branham well according to your prophet he said the bride would be the final voice to the final age unless you take what you want to you do what you want to because you're going you are anyway the bride is to be the final voice to the final age so what's the world waiting on the bride waiting on the bride to realize the redemption is already transpired do you realize for you to be healed of anything you must first have it made known to you that you're healed then you must confess that you're healed you realize it's the same thing for your salvation you must realize that your believe it's your saved and then you must confess that you're saved for God to make it a manifestation so somebody is going to stand here and say I'm changed and then God can make it manifest so he's waiting on us in a nod the one thing that God is waiting on is the bride to find her position of who she is and what she's doing so adoption is taught in three stages Stage one is your new birth that brings you into the body makes you co-equal with him in the new birth second stage is your manifestation of sons and daughters of the Living God adoption so I asked you if you'd read the messages on adoption if you read them or listened to the tapes you'll find a lot of things but then the last is to know to stand here and understand the redemption of the body then God can make it manifest right so what are we talking about what is their thought predestinated unto adoption okay so if we believe that adoption is made forth in our brought forth in three stages and there's people in each one of those stages and some will receive the new birth and that's as far as they'll go because that was where God predestinated him because that's where he knew they would be able to attain there will be some that will reach the manifestation of sons and daughters of the Living God to where that their name is just as good on a checkbook is his name see we're getting to that the authorities and that all of that and some are predestinated to come to that place that's where people is always different with me and not only I say well you just go ahead they said of manifester son can't die I said well first off they killed the Lord Jesus and I kind of believe he was a manifested son but I said all those apostles they were manifested for the day in the hour they were living in time all right and all of them died and went by the grave I said brother Branham I believe he was a manifested son don't you then he died went by the grave so it doesn't mean anything and that's one that I've always tried to tell you that then when I said that God showed me that people could die and go by the grace I spent no time talking about their position their position could be a higher than you and waiting on you to try to reach a position to call them out that's all I've ever tried to say why because I believe a manifested son and daughter of God can go by the grave why because the change is for the only part and listen the change of the body is the only part that is a full collective point in the Bride of Christ are you with me it ain't gonna be one change here and then two weeks later somebody changed here months later whatever I don't know if the gothy wants to do that but I'm just saying it when it comes down to the change of the body it's coming more into all around the world you said will give me scripture to individ want to be taken to over here working in the field one taken all right we still in the scripture all right so then we've got it lined up correctly see when the change comes it's gonna point more back to a group because we're all gonna go meet him in the iron as a group but your adoptions before them is individuals come into their place let those individuals reach their place the body change will come I'm going to drop back because brother branham said have faith and be born again he said then you take that new birth he said that new birth brings faith in the soul and he says these virtues will be automatically added now he didn't say that the way we make automatic we put it when while I do nothing is automatically added now that wouldn't what he said because you've got to cover the tutorship and the training and the child's got to be willing right then they'll be automatically added because your church you're not a chicken you're a peacock or an eagle it's going to be automatically added because you're in Christ not just automatically added because when I are I don't have to worry about anything about America I don't do what I want to live like the devil that's all gonna be there the Prophet said it that wouldn't what he said he brings the whole basis of the message behind the point of him saying they'd be automatically added why because the baby just automatically grows up to being an adult all this got to do is eat and that's all I've ever said about this message just eat this message until you become the message why not you know but I just I just have problems with we're trying to read and study why find another way listen to tapes you can't read listen to tapes whatever it takes brother got upset at me one time because I said you just won't read he couldn't read anyone told people I was going off on him I went to him I said brother get tapes and listen to them you don't have to read you can listen to tapes and I didn't back down and smile I said it turned because I knew him I said you can listen to tapes ain't you know I'm not talking about going off on you cause you can't read but that's how easy you can get them little bugs then little demons to set on your shoulders and think right but you understand that hurts what I'm talking about there's people that are predestinated by God's foreknowledge and it's determined by foreknowledge and things and they'll only reach a certain place when Martin Luther reached the place of the just shall live by faith there was nowhere for him to go but by the grave when John Wesley reached predestination of sanctification he could not continue it the further he was predestinated God saw that was what he would attain unto he went by the grave are you listening some are predestinated to the new birth and that's as far as they'll go they'll get born again as far as they go praise God they're Christians they're born to get increases there in the body of Christ that's they reached their place of predestination with summer predestinated to go further now watch we've been here 40 or 50 years since the prophets go what in child training this hasn't been child training for you for 40 50 years well then okay you ain't been following you tutor because your tutor is trying to encourage you to understand the word and to study the Word of God we should know this message so much that those those Pharisees could you know those people that claim could take a scroll to stick a pin through tell you every letter we order not just know the letter wielder know the scroll next to it and where the pen would go why because why hasn't it been that we have this message come on you know what I just said is right the brother Dale I've studied I prayed over it that's right but you know what you can do more and I'm throwing it to me come on it's bouncing back you can do more well I put forth so much well I much effort you put on everything else what do you understand what I'm saying now to listen some are predestinated to receive the new birth and that's as far as they'll go and they're in the bride across their part of the body of Christ some are predestinated to come up some of these virtues and things coming up on to the higher things and coming out and you can see them in their lives and their predestinated and they go by the grave because that's as far as they were predestinate but somebody's predestinated to stand here and take a change that's why Paul says it why read Ephesians that we're predestinated unto adoption because everybody's not predestinated to the same stage but there is a stage for all of us to be predestinated - somebody's gonna stand here and take a change come on musicians somebody's gonna take a change somebody's predestinated to make a change and it still ain't change what did the prophets say one day he said I doubt a doesn't know what wasn't out of this generation now he wasn't talking about going to heaven was it he would talk about born-again believers in Christianity what what he talked about I got to be a dozen that'll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you know what cuz only those that are predestinated to that place will reach that place outside of that and I'm not predestinated to that place then I'll go by the gray no problem that's not decreasing I than anybody that goes by the gray it's saying they reach their place what are we gonna do they reach their place right you say yeah but look at all of us we're getting older and it's got part to it too but there's people who live 100 years old now so then sister Cletus he still got a few years for she reaches 100 that's true I never thought I'd ever be 78 years old I never thought I'd be 50 I mean after coming in this message I never thought I'd ever be 50 but you don't know what I've enjoyed it you know what he gives me 50 more I've enjoyed it I've had a good time I've been able to read and study about things and see things take place that even the Apostles and even the prophets desired to look in truth and did not see why don't you think like that sometimes what a wonderful opportunity out of all of this world of seven billion people that he choose you well if he chose you it must have been chosen because the Bible says or I turn Ephesians that were chosen in him so then it means we were chosen in him not chosen of him chosen in him to come to predestination of a change of these bodies who right on down through and feedings worse that unless the mystery of his will letter Brennan said the mystery of
