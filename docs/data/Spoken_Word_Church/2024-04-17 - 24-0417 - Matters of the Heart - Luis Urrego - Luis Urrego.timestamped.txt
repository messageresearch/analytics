[10:56] commit the time into your hands in Jesus
[10:58] Christ's name
[11:00] amen praise the Lord
[11:02] Jesus amen well let's turn to um
[11:05] Proverbs chapter
[11:07] 4 and uh I want to see if I could uh
[11:10] start a little series I I want to call
[11:12] it matters of the heart and this will be
[11:15] part one kind of laying a little
[11:18] Foundation I I come to realize saints
[11:21] that
[11:22] that um everything that happens in our
[11:25] lives and everything that goes on it
[11:29] boils down to a an issue of the
[11:33] heart there's nothing that goes on no
[11:36] matter whether you're a sinner or a
[11:38] saint it all boils down to a heart heart
[11:43] issue uh and and later on maybe uh uh in
[11:48] in other messages we'll find out that
[11:52] Satan from the beginning has wanted your
[11:54] heart yeah right but God has also wanted
[11:57] your heart
[11:59] and and so it's a it's where brother
[12:02] brandom also preached that message the
[12:04] greatest battle ever fought maybe we
[12:06] might touch that upon that at a later
[12:08] point but we realize that that it's it's
[12:12] it's a it's a heart issue that we're
[12:14] dealing with in this hour am and um and
[12:18] so the Bible clearly tells us amen that
[12:21] that we need to guard our hearts amen
[12:24] because Satan's really targeting
[12:26] targeting so we want to go to Proverbs
[12:28] chapter 4 and and read the scriptures
[12:30] here and you all can see that right amen
[12:34] okay all right so it says in Proverbs
[12:37] chapter
[12:39] 4 verse 20 it says my son attend to my
[12:43] words incline thine ear unto my sayings
[12:48] now we know this is this is Solomon
[12:50] speaking the wisest man that ever lived
[12:54] right and he says verse 21 let them not
[12:58] depart from thine eyes keep them in the
[13:01] midst of thine heart he's talking about
[13:05] his words now I want you to realize that
[13:07] is this is God speaking through Solomon
[13:10] right so this is this is not just
[13:12] Solomon speaking this is God speaking
[13:14] right let them not depart from Thine
[13:16] Eyes keep them in the midst of thine
[13:18] heart what those words those sayings for
[13:21] they are life unto those that find them
[13:25] and health to all their flesh notice how
[13:28] it says for they are life unto those
[13:31] that find them the word the sayings of
[13:34] God are life he said my words are spirit
[13:37] and their life verse 23 and this is
[13:39] where I want to start with and
[13:41] concentrate keep thy heart with all
[13:44] diligence for out of it are the issues
[13:48] of Life praise the Lord Jesus you may be
[13:52] seated appreciate your patience
[13:56] amen the good new the good new
[13:59] translation says be careful how you
[14:01] think your life is shaped by your
[14:05] thoughts amen so as we're going through
[14:07] here these are these are my raw notes
[14:10] these are these are notes that usually
[14:12] you don't see but I wanted to test this
[14:14] thing so so uh you might see some things
[14:18] that were just for me but you'll get to
[14:19] see them
[14:21] tonight and see how I usually take notes
[14:24] but the Bible says there in the good
[14:26] news translation be careful how you
[14:28] think your life is shaped by your
[14:30] thoughts absolutely amen it's really
[14:33] really what this boils down to whatever
[14:35] you think whatever you put your mind to
[14:37] whatever you do it was originated by a
[14:41] thought first you had to think it you
[14:44] had to ponder it you had to uh consider
[14:47] it in order for you to put it into
[14:49] action right you know we saw that even
[14:52] in in in in in Genesis in in in the
[14:54] Garden of Eden there with with with Eve
[14:57] and the serpent
[14:59] Satan had to inject the thought first
[15:03] into Eve and it could have been a
[15:05] process of many years I don't know we
[15:08] don't know exactly how long it was but
[15:10] it was a process that started very very
[15:13] little amen and then it finally grew she
[15:17] she ruminated kind of uh uh chewed on
[15:20] that a little bit more and more every
[15:22] day until finally it culminated into
[15:25] what Satan really wanted for her to to
[15:28] to perform and it culminated into an
[15:30] action and that's how it is it is with
[15:33] us tonight Saints most of the time we
[15:36] don't do things just out of just like
[15:39] that most of the time it's because we
[15:42] actually thought about
[15:43] it and then you take action amen and so
[15:48] and so that can be that that that's
[15:50] tricky you see because sometimes you
[15:52] know we we might do things up on on a
[15:55] whim and get ourselves in trouble but
[15:57] also we can think about things and then
[16:00] eventually get ourselves in trouble as
[16:02] well you see so it's it it's very tricky
[16:06] now in Matthew uh 12:34 and 35 Jesus
[16:11] says this oh Generation of Vipers how
[16:14] can ye being evil he was speaking to the
[16:17] to the
[16:18] Pharisees and uh later on uh maybe in
[16:21] another sermon we'll we we'll take the
[16:23] context of what he what what was going
[16:25] on here but he says this oh Generation
[16:27] of Vipers how can you being evil speak
[16:30] good things for out of the abundance of
[16:33] the heart the mouth speaketh a good man
[16:38] out of the good Treasure of the heart
[16:41] bringeth forth good
[16:43] things notice that he calls it a good
[16:46] treasure right the good Treasure of the
[16:49] heart bringeth forth good things and an
[16:51] evil man out of the evil treasure
[16:54] bringeth forth evil things we'll we'll
[16:56] we'll we'll we'll look at that we'll
[16:58] look at that a little bit later now we
[17:00] know that physical heart Trouble Is On
[17:03] The
[17:04] Rise since 20 2019 it's rose up I don't
[17:07] know how much since since Co it's rose
[17:10] up I don't know how much right amen but
[17:13] at the same time we see that spiritual
[17:15] heart Trouble Is On The Rise as
[17:17] well uh if you're not seeing that then
[17:20] then you're just you're just in la la
[17:22] land people are are are are dying
[17:26] physically that's right they say that
[17:28] young people are having more heart
[17:30] attacks now than ever had before am
[17:34] amen and Satan is targeting the young
[17:37] people more than ever had before and
[17:39] they're dying like flies as well
[17:41] spiritually amen people are dying
[17:44] spiritually left and right people who
[17:46] you think wow they they're just faithful
[17:49] Christians my goodness just dying like
[17:51] flies Y and you're wondering what is
[17:54] going on but Satan is on the Rampage
[17:56] amen but God is also on the ramp
[18:00] because as people are dying amen this
[18:02] bride is rising up somebody's going to
[18:05] stay firm somebody's not going to listen
[18:07] to the LIE of the devil somebody is
[18:10] going to believe God's word in their
[18:12] soul Amen in their heart they're going
[18:14] to accept God's word in their heart and
[18:17] it won't just be head knowledge amen
[18:18] it'll be heart knowledge amen it'll be
[18:21] it'll be in the heart it'll put you into
[18:23] action to believe the rest of the word
[18:25] no matter what Satan brings on you no
[18:27] matter what Satan throws at you amen you
[18:29] stay
[18:30] steadfast God said he was going to have
[18:32] Overcomers in this life am in this in
[18:36] this
[18:37] generation and I believe I'm looking at
[18:39] him right
[18:40] now I don't know about you you can be
[18:42] there well I don't know I I I I I you
[18:45] should have just heard what I told my
[18:47] wife yesterday if you repented of it I
[18:50] don't God don't see it amen and don't
[18:54] let the devil keep telling you that or
[18:57] keep reminding you of that because he's
[18:59] only lying y praise God amen
[19:03] amen well right I spoke to my husband
[19:06] and just I I just didn't like the
[19:08] attitude I had forget about it if you've
[19:10] repented put it to God ask your husband
[19:13] to forgive you and move on Amen because
[19:16] that's what we're that's what we we got
[19:18] to do Saints we're living in a late hour
[19:21] amen it's not time to play games it's
[19:24] time to move forward amen especially
[19:27] when you see what the things happen
[19:29] around us amen now in Luke 20 Luke 2026
[19:33] 21:26 tells us that man's heart's
[19:35] failing them for fear Jesus speaking
[19:37] about the end times and for looking
[19:39] after those things which are coming on
[19:41] the earth for the powers of Heaven shall
[19:43] be shaken Saints I I I want to tell you
[19:45] that it doesn't matter what happens
[19:48] there will be Wars rumors of wars all
[19:51] things are taking place we see the word
[19:53] of God that is around us that is being
[19:56] fulfilled amen but this is the time for
[19:59] you to actually rejoice in the Lord his
[20:03] word is coming to pass do not get
[20:06] fixated and do not get uh uh fearful
[20:10] amen for what's going on Amen because
[20:13] God is in
[20:15] control ultimately the Lord is in
[20:18] control do not come out with your own
[20:20] conclusions about things people for a
[20:23] long time have thought that this is
[20:24] what's happening this is what's
[20:26] happening and nothing like that didn't
[20:28] come out the way they say it was going
[20:29] to happen am so you just stay working
[20:32] and thinking about the word of God amen
[20:35] amen how can I grow spiritually in the
[20:37] time of of of what's happening in Israel
[20:40] amen how can I keep growing in the Lord
[20:42] how can I become a better brother how
[20:44] can I become a better sister a a better
[20:46] son or a better daughter a a better
[20:49] husband a better wife amen I I that's
[20:52] fine what the Lord is doing in Israel
[20:54] that that that's fine amen but what
[20:56] what's going on in your life in your
[20:58] Israel amen Satan is fighting in your
[21:02] the the in your mind that's the greatest
[21:05] battle ever fought even even higher than
[21:08] what's going on in Israel right now cuz
[21:10] he's after your soul amen amen and we
[21:13] don't want to give him our soul we don't
[21:15] want to give him our heart amen praise
[21:17] the Lord Jesus so let's uh let's let's
[21:20] kind of break down this this uh this
[21:23] Proverbs 4: 23 and it says keep thy
[21:27] heart with all diligence for out of it
[21:31] are the issues of life now I want I I
[21:33] put here that in this verse we we find
[21:37] the what of this verse and what is the
[21:39] what of this verse it is the heart right
[21:43] then we have the how of this verse and
[21:46] usually usually before the the how we
[21:48] usually have the why before that but in
[21:50] this case the how comes next and then
[21:53] and and and what and and the how is of
[21:56] this verse is to keep it with all
[21:58] diligence amen and the why of this verse
[22:02] is because out of it comes the issues of
[22:06] Life brother
[22:07] man young people and adults amen it has
[22:13] to be formed in your heart first you
[22:15] have to first let something through the
[22:18] Avenues of the of the of of the of the
[22:21] hearing and the and the seeing and and
[22:23] the five physical senses to come into
[22:25] you to and process it through the spirit
[22:28] spiritual through through through a
[22:29] spirit man and then if you let it and
[22:33] it's your choice if you let it then
[22:37] it'll sit there in your heart and create
[22:39] a create a problem if you choose to do
[22:42] so and brother brandham talked about
[22:45] that in such detail in in in in the
[22:47] greatest battle ever fought amen and so
[22:51] it's it's your decision amen this all
[22:53] stems on free moral
[22:55] agency of what's going to happen in your
[22:57] life you decide God has placed the the
[23:02] the the word before you he's placed the
[23:04] way out for you he's placed the plan for
[23:07] you you decide if you want to if you
[23:09] want to choose life or
[23:11] death amen and then when time comes that
[23:14] you're judged you're judged according to
[23:17] your decision amen because God gave you
[23:19] the choice amen and I thank God for that
[23:22] am amen thank God that he gives us
[23:24] that's his grace to us amen praise the
[23:27] Lord now so the scripture there tells us
[23:29] to keep thy heart with all diligence now
[23:32] if you look at the definition of keep it
[23:34] says to watch to guard to keep to
[23:38] preserve Guard from dangers to keep
[23:41] observe guard with Fidelity to guard
[23:44] keep secret to be kept closed to be
[23:48] blockaded amen and I started thinking
[23:50] about the role of of the Watchmen in the
[23:52] Bible Watchmen uh in the Bible what what
[23:56] was their purpose in in the Bible a
[23:58] Watchman that was guarding a castle or a
[24:01] big a big fortress it was to make sure
[24:05] that the enemy could be seen from far
[24:08] off not that the enemy would get so
[24:11] close and then we'll do something about
[24:13] it no to see how to see how far how we
[24:17] can see the enemy away from their
[24:20] target then go go to them if we need to
[24:23] right call out the Infantry and go take
[24:26] care of that then but what we do is we
[24:28] allow the enemy to come in so close so
[24:32] close they're at the they're at the door
[24:34] I mean they're just getting ready to
[24:36] knock your door down and that's when you
[24:38] think that you should do something about
[24:40] it come on brother and it might be too
[24:42] late
[24:43] then you're already teetering there at
[24:46] the border amen right there at the world
[24:49] and that's what happens with a lot of us
[24:51] man especially young people am man
[24:53] they're just teetering right there at
[24:55] the world and they think that they have
[24:56] it under control and not knowing it just
[24:59] the wrong step amen they are going down
[25:02] the enemy completely takes over amen so
[25:05] that's what a Watchman was supposed to
[25:07] do he was supposed to constantly watch
[25:10] and see the enemy from far off to make
[25:13] adjustments to make calls to make to do
[25:15] whatever it took to so they they can
[25:17] guard he could guard the castle or guard
[25:20] the whatever they were watching for or
[25:23] or guarding that was the purpose of the
[25:25] Watchmen amen and so Solomon here is
[25:29] telling us in Proverbs to keep a close
[25:32] watch of your heart in this manner
[25:35] Amen to keep a close guard of your life
[25:40] amen because really the heart is really
[25:42] who you are
[25:44] amen right amen it's the soul amen amen
[25:48] it's it's who you really are because let
[25:51] me tell you you can put on a facade on
[25:52] the outside but God knows who you are on
[25:54] the
[25:55] inside you can put on here at church all
[25:58] you want to but God knows what really
[26:00] goes on in that heart am come on
[26:04] Amen and so if if we're if we're slack
[26:08] and if we're not lazy watching our
[26:10] hearts making sure that we are diligent
[26:13] Amen in what we do what we don't do how
[26:16] we pray when we pray how we do things
[26:19] Amen to grow and to amen then we we are
[26:23] we are we are uh uh susceptible to be
[26:25] attacked by the enemy much easier
[26:28] remember what Satan wants at the
[26:29] beginning he wants that heart yes he
[26:31] does he wants unbelief in your
[26:34] soul because with unbelief in that Soul
[26:37] amen then you won't have any chance to
[26:40] to accept the rest of the word of God
[26:42] you've you've done you you've disbel the
[26:44] word
[26:46] amen that's why those Pharisees and
[26:48] we'll talk about those Pharisees later
[26:50] on the Pharisees they were putting on
[26:53] outward see they thought they knew the
[26:56] law and they did
[26:59] but not enough to cause them to live the
[27:01] law they didn't love it enough that they
[27:03] wanted to live it they were in such good
[27:07] standing before the people that they
[27:09] were able to get away and maneuver
[27:11] themselves to make the people think
[27:13] we're doing this but in reality they're
[27:15] in the they're behind the scenes doing
[27:17] other stuff right brother amen and Jesus
[27:19] knew that amen Ain no telling what else
[27:23] what what they were doing but because
[27:25] Jesus said that you are just man with
[27:27] full of dead Man's
[27:29] Bones on the outward you look good
[27:32] you're just tombs full of Dead Man's
[27:34] Bones but in the inside they were rotten
[27:39] on the outward they they they they
[27:41] looked like they were keeping the law
[27:44] they looked like they were doing
[27:45] everything and even more right right and
[27:48] even even for how much they knew about
[27:51] the law but they didn't love the law
[27:54] enough to make them change from the
[27:57] inside out
[27:59] and we saw that we see that that
[28:01] evidence because when Messiah came and
[28:03] they and Messiah started doing good
[28:04] deeds Healing The Sick amongst them they
[28:07] were so full of jealousy so full of they
[28:11] they were okay for for for demons to be
[28:13] cast out and all that because they knew
[28:15] that that that by the power of God that
[28:17] was done but not if Jesus did it that's
[28:20] right if Jesus did it was a different
[28:23] thing I wonder if we take some of the
[28:25] some sometimes that that that attitude
[28:27] amen that's right amen so it's okay if
[28:30] brother so and so does
[28:32] it but I if brother so and so does it oh
[28:37] I have a problem with it and brother so
[28:39] and so is being used by
[28:41] God and brother Z and so is probably a
[28:45] is probably just uh uh uh taking your
[28:50] hideout by the through the word and
[28:52] that's what you don't like that's
[28:55] right he's spanking you spiritually
[28:58] because God told him
[29:00] to and that's what you don't
[29:02] like you don't like the word being
[29:04] preached to you but you like the word
[29:06] being
[29:07] preached but not to
[29:10] you I've been
[29:13] there we don't like the word when it
[29:15] comes personal level and it starts
[29:18] touching down to your home base to your
[29:21] your your your your your heart coming
[29:25] down to the Heart level that's what we
[29:27] don't like right oh yes but we love what
[29:29] the word preached though those Pharisees
[29:32] love the law but not when Jesus came
[29:34] into the heart and talk about their
[29:36] their their personal issues but it was
[29:39] the word
[29:40] anyhow it's the word anyhow when it's
[29:43] preached amen praise God Amen so that
[29:47] was the the the roles of the Watchmen
[29:49] and that's what we have to do amen we
[29:51] have to watch our lives in this way as a
[29:54] Watchman praise God diligent now verse
[29:58] 23 keeps saying keep thy heart with all
[30:01] D diligence and the word diligence means
[30:04] this steady Earnest and energetic effort
[30:09] amen it's an effort Saints to serve the
[30:12] Lord amen it doesn't come to you amen
[30:15] you have to put something into this as
[30:18] well that's right praise God it it would
[30:21] be easy to to for everything to just
[30:23] come to you but you got to put something
[30:25] into this in order to get something out
[30:27] of it amen right devoted in painstaking
[30:30] work and application to accomplish an
[30:33] undertaking you know and and it seems
[30:36] like in in in America we it looks like
[30:38] that that all you know the churches all
[30:41] they they keep making Christianity how
[30:43] fun it is and and how how good you can
[30:46] have a good time at church and and and
[30:49] Just Dance it dance it all off until
[30:52] their wigs fall off and and and go back
[30:54] home and and and and and listen to rap
[30:57] music and curse at their husband and and
[31:00] then come back Sunday and do it again
[31:03] that's right until your wigs fall off
[31:05] and everything falls
[31:07] off and it's fun church is fun that's
[31:10] what they think that's right but there
[31:12] is no fighting back home there is no no
[31:16] no victory over over your life amen no
[31:19] no victory over over you amen when you
[31:22] when you're tired and you you don't want
[31:24] to pray but but yet you you you pray
[31:28] because you it's coming from the heart
[31:30] amen and not from from the outside amen
[31:34] not for where you could get out of it
[31:35] amen but what glorifies him because you
[31:38] desire a a relationship with God amen
[31:42] amen praise the Lord
[31:44] Jesus don't think that church is is fun
[31:48] church can be fun yeah but it's fun when
[31:51] you got the Holy Ghost Inside
[31:54] amen too many people am amen just come
[31:58] to church to see what they can get out
[32:00] of what fun they can get out and that's
[32:01] what these corporate churches have made
[32:03] it right brother I call them corporate
[32:06] churches the one the ones that use them
[32:08] logos that that that look like corporate
[32:10] logos they're corporate churches that's
[32:13] what IBM uses and and and and and Amazon
[32:16] and all that well they it's it's an
[32:19] organization it's a
[32:21] business I'm not saying that they're not
[32:23] good people in there I'm sure that there
[32:25] are sincere people in there and I've
[32:27] I've benefit from some of those some
[32:29] some some some of those preachings and
[32:31] and and and songs as well but ultimately
[32:35] Saints what are you coming to church
[32:37] foren what is your purpose what's in
[32:40] your heart amen because remember this is
[32:43] a heart matter it's matters of the heart

[32:49] church what is it amen come on are you
[32:52] afraid that man is going to say
[32:54] something to you if you
[32:56] don't is is that the reason why you come
[32:58] to
[32:59] church or do you want to come to church
[33:02] because your heart what God put in your
[33:04] heart through his word that's what
[33:06] desires that that's what wants more
[33:09] amen what what is what is your purpose
[33:12] amen and I appreciate each and every one

[33:24] push back sometimes and come on come on
[33:27] maybe we're touching the
[33:28] [Laughter]
[33:30] heart so we have D diligence amen uh uh
[33:34] and when we painstakenly work on our
[33:37] lives we we we are diligent to keep your

[33:41] homes as neat as we can no no grease
[33:45] spot anywhere no dirt no
[33:48] nothing amen something will come along
[33:51] the way that'll change that's
[33:54] right it ain't all about that no that's
[33:56] right
[33:58] we're diligent to keep our cars as speak
[34:01] and span as possible but wait until you
[34:03] have
[34:06] children I you know I thought that I
[34:08] could keep my vehicles you know nice no
[34:10] no crumbs in the back and no melting
[34:13] crayons in the in the on the side doors
[34:15] or anything like that gummies and things
[34:18] like that that went out the window
[34:20] that's but I'm not blaming my children
[34:22] that's not what I'm trying to say I'm
[34:23] just saying that that right there
[34:25] changed my mindset about
[34:28] your cars are not going to last
[34:31] forever they're going to deteriorate
[34:33] from the inside
[34:35] out and that's God teaching me something
[34:38] because I was very I loved my cars you
[34:40] know I had a 1998 Honda Civic that was
[34:42] my first car man I had that thing shiny
[34:45] I had that thing looking good all the
[34:46] time my wife got to drive that's where
[34:48] she learned how to drive it was a
[34:52] manual and uh but that went out the
[34:55] window you know when we started having
[34:56] children you know
[34:59] and the God was teaching me something
[35:01] you're paying you're very diligent with
[35:03] your car Louise what about your prayer
[35:07] life what about your studying of the
[35:09] word amen do you love those children
[35:12] more than that car or that car more than
[35:14] those children are are you willing to
[35:17] take you know what we do sometimes we we
[35:18] get upset at our children for messing up
[35:20] our vehicles and stuff like that and
[35:23] what you're really doing is you're
[35:24] hurting
[35:25] them they're they're now they're they're
[35:28] becoming afraid of you because you
[35:31] they're touch they're touching or doing
[35:32] something with the reality what you can
[35:35] what you need to do is just let it go so
[35:38] that you can win them more
[35:41] amen and and it's something that I had
[35:43] to learn and and but God works with us
[35:47] in different levels amen your car ain't
[35:50] going to last forever it doesn't have
[35:52] eternal life and it doesn't even have a
[35:54] [Laughter]
[35:56] heart praise God that's why I buy them
[35:59] used not
[36:02] new they Ramsey said so
[36:05] [Laughter]
[36:06] too amen diligence to come out on top
[36:09] financially I mean we all desire that
[36:12] right amen we're supposed to be good
[36:14] stewards for of our of our of our money
[36:18] amen but some of us we get so fixated on
[36:22] that and and we and we're so
[36:23] concentrated on that and making sure
[36:25] that our finances and that our money is
[36:27] well and then you're forgetting the main
[36:30] thing what you can use those finances
[36:32] for amen why are you accumulating wealth
[36:36] on this life when you're going to who
[36:37] are you going to leave it to amen you
[36:40] see diligence to finish school we all
[36:43] need to finish school young people
[36:44] you've got to finish school amen and
[36:47] sometimes we can get so fixed about the
[36:48] education and I've got to finish High
[36:50] School I've got to graduate amen but who
[36:52] can help you get through high school who
[36:55] can help you get through college who can
[36:56] help you amen think about the who the
[36:59] the him that can help you get through
[37:01] those things amen diligence to get
[37:03] married amen we we give it so much
[37:05] diligence amen I've got to find somebody
[37:07] in my life of a husband I got to find a
[37:10] wife and and you're not even seeking him
[37:12] first brother you're seeking the other
[37:14] man first but you're not seeking him
[37:17] right first right and then we find the
[37:21] the great mistakes that young people
[37:23] sometimes get into three years down the
[37:26] road they're they're they're they're
[37:27] filing for divorce or or something on
[37:30] those sort why because they rushed they
[37:32] were diligent about seeking a man in
[37:34] their life or or or a lady or or a
[37:36] sister in their life but not diligent
[37:38] enough to seek the Lord first amen
[37:41] praise God and we're diligent to look
[37:44] good and feel good amen that the world
[37:46] is is is is is all about wanting to feel
[37:48] good and and look good and all you got
[37:51] to do is just scroll through Facebook
[37:52] and you you'll you'll you'll see that
[37:55] right but we're all diligent for this
[37:57] but the the Bible tells us amen that we
[37:59] need to be diligent about keeping the
[38:01] heart with all
[38:03] diligence you want to give all effort to
[38:05] all these things that's great give the
[38:07] all that you've got but remember you
[38:09] give God more amen praise the Lord Jesus
[38:13] be diligent with all these things amen
[38:15] because we're diligent in many many
[38:17] things but we're not diligent enough to
[38:20] seek God to guard our heart right
[38:22] because remember why are we doing this
[38:25] why are we doing this because out of it
[38:28] look what Solomon says but above all
[38:30] guard your heart your inner life your
[38:34] soul amen remember what brother Ram said
[38:37] about the soul is worth
[38:40] what a
[38:42] dollar 50
[38:44] cents that's what the rapper is 50
[38:48] Cents if y'all know who 50 Cent
[38:53] is his soul might be worth that if he
[38:55] don't come to the Lord that's right
[39:00] not but your soul a is what BR said is
[39:03] worth 10,000
[39:05] worlds amen what is that that means it
[39:08] has no value to it I mean it has
[39:11] unlimited value that's what I mean right
[39:13] your soul is very very important amen
[39:15] it's so important that Satan wants it
[39:18] yes he amen and people sell their
[39:21] souls for money for rock and roll for
[39:25] for fame for all these things they
[39:27] they're willing to sell it sure amen and
[39:30] there is no turning
[39:31] back when you fully give into the
[39:34] devil's lies but God also wants your
[39:37] soul right amen and as a matter of fact
[39:41] he's the one who gave you that
[39:43] Soul so what he gave you we give back to
[39:47] him and and Lord you reside in my soul
[39:50] we want your mind and what is his mind
[39:53] his soul his spirit amen so that he he
[39:57] let mind of Christ be in you praise God
[40:01] Amen and let that work through you amen
[40:03] right praise the Lord
[40:05] Jesus so why why should we keep the
[40:08] heart with all diligence and in verse 23
[40:11] and it says there at the end for out of
[40:12] it are the issues of life amen in other
[40:16] words you you will be made or broken
[40:19] according to what happens in your heart
[40:21] that's
[40:22] right right you will be made or broken
[40:25] according to what happens in your life
[40:28] everyone of life's great issues events
[40:31] problems victories successes Etc at the
[40:34] root stem from being a matter of the
[40:37] heart everything that happens in your
[40:40] life sir is the root cause is the heart
[40:45] amen amen and so let that's why we want
[40:48] God to get a hold of us at a young age
[40:51] amen you know there's a quote where
[40:53] brother brandom is saying that that that
[40:55] uh he says something on the line of
[40:58] um when he was 12 years old and God was
[41:01] trying to to get a hold of him but he
[41:04] said there was a spirit on him that's
[41:06] right that wouldn't let him come to God
[41:08] right there's something on those lines
[41:10] that he said that he says that in some
[41:12] 1950s and you see Satan at a young at a
[41:16] young age he wants you young people he
[41:20] he wants you but if at a young age you
[41:23] can get to God Amen if at a young age
[41:26] you can let God get a hold of your heart
[41:29] amen it would be much easier at your
[41:31] walk Amen in life it wouldn't be easy
[41:35] I'm just saying it'll be
[41:38] easier amen praise the Lord Jesus amen
[41:42] now brother Brandon would say it like
[41:44] this he says as I was saying a few days
[41:46] ago either here or somewhere speaking on
[41:49] the lie detector now notice close now I
[41:52] want you to pay close attention put a
[41:54] lie detector on you and you try to
[41:57] impersonate that truth and try to say
[41:59] that it's truth but down on the inside
[42:02] of you in the subconscious lays a place
[42:04] called The
[42:07] Soul so even when you are telling a lie
[42:11] the the device is knows because what it
[42:15] does it's making your body act in a
[42:17] certain way your body was not made to
[42:19] lie your body was not made to to steal
[42:22] to think bad thoughts to do all these
[42:25] things so when you are put on on a lie
[42:27] detector if the police C thinks that
[42:29] that you may know something uh and and
[42:32] they put you on a lie detector or or
[42:34] polygraph test I think is what it's
[42:36] called that machine will know if you're
[42:39] lying or not it's it's from my
[42:41] understanding it's it's pretty accurate
[42:44] because not because the body is telling
[42:47] it yes he's lying here or no he's not
[42:50] lying here but it's the way your body
[42:52] reacts when you do tell a lie your body
[42:55] starts getting nervous your body and so
[42:58] the the machine is made to detect that
[43:01] that nervousness I don't know all the
[43:02] details about it so that's what brother
[43:04] brandom is talking about here amen he's
[43:06] saying you put a lie detector on you and
[43:08] you try to impersonate that truth and
[43:10] try to say that it's truth you I am
[43:13] telling the truth but down on the inside
[43:16] of you in the subconscious lays a place
[43:18] called The Soul amen and this
[43:21] intellectual mind does not govern that
[43:24] vibration of the system the mind is only
[43:27] only a director it will direct you and
[43:29] it's very incapable of bringing you to
[43:32] God your mind so he says here you cannot
[43:35] know God by your mind or in other words
[43:39] intellectuals now later on he'll talk
[43:41] about the mind in the in the greatest
[43:42] battle ever fault we'll discuss that
[43:44] later on but here he's talking about the
[43:47] intellectuals amen intellectually you
[43:49] cannot know
[43:51] God in the heart right you cannot you
[43:55] can you can learn things things in the
[43:58] mind and and but that does not mean that
[44:01] you know God in the heart that's right
[44:05] you see you can know the Bible you can
[44:08] you can read the the you can know the
[44:10] verses you can even know the
[44:13] quotes but it it takes it to be down in
[44:16] the heart for there to be a true
[44:18] transformation amen that's what matters
[44:22] it's one of the resources he says or the
[44:24] channels that would lead to it but says
[44:27] here but your soul is what governs you
[44:29] that's right you are what you are by
[44:32] your soul amen you are what you think
[44:36] about at
[44:38] night you
[44:39] are what you think about during the
[44:42] day what's driving you what's pushing
[44:46] you is it the word of God or is it a
[44:49] little or is it some sort of stimulant
[44:52] from the internet come on now you see
[44:55] right praise God now in Proverbs
[44:58] 23:7 Bible says there for as he thinketh
[45:01] in his heart so is he amen so in other
[45:03] words whatever you think in your heart
[45:06] that's what you are amen amen whatever
[45:09] you constantly think about that's what
[45:12] will come out of you praise the Lord
[45:15] Jesus out of the Jesus said out of the
[45:17] abundance of the
[45:18] heart will your mouth speak praise God
[45:21] Amen now Marcus aelius I don't know if
[45:24] you all have heard of Marcus aelius he's
[45:26] a a philosoph oper he said the following
[45:28] he said the soul is dyed the color of
[45:32] its
[45:33] thoughts whatever your thoughts are and
[45:35] I thought that was pretty interesting
[45:37] the soul is dyed the color of its
[45:40] thoughts so if they're good thoughts
[45:42] then they'll be died with those good
[45:44] thoughts if they're bad thoughts they'll
[45:46] be died with those bad thoughts and
[45:48] those bad thoughts will eventually
[45:50] culminate into
[45:52] actions oh you could say well I'm just
[45:54] thinking about it well that thought just
[45:56] came cross to your mind you know that
[46:00] thought you know whatever it may
[46:02] be and if you sit there and play with
[46:05] that thought you might say I'll never
[46:08] put that into action I'll never actually
[46:11] do that but man
[46:14] it's it's actually pretty interesting
[46:16] though but it'll never happen
[46:19] though you're playing with the thought
[46:22] right and it could be years years for
[46:26] that to to take place you know an an an
[46:28] adultery doesn't take place just right
[46:30] away most of the
[46:32] time it could be it could be years for
[46:36] that to have gotten in the Heart Right
[46:39] some thought may have come in right
[46:41] there and
[46:43] like the secretary at work she's a
[46:47] pretty nice
[46:48] girl yeah and just playing with that
[46:52] thought brother and Satan will come in
[46:55] and anoint that y well and you accepted
[46:58] that thought because remember it comes
[47:01] through what you saw you ruminated it in
[47:04] the spirit realm right the conscience
[47:07] the affections the my she she she she
[47:11] needs someone too but you know but my
[47:13] wife you
[47:15] know I'm just being real with you
[47:17] all and that's how Satan starts and then
[47:20] you desire and then you start thinking
[47:22] and if you if you let it get into your
[47:26] heart
[47:28] that's the moment where you can say okay
[47:30] I reject that or or I accept it that's
[47:33] right when you accept it then you start
[47:36] cuddling that thought even
[47:38] more that's
[47:40] right man look how she looks
[47:43] today and your poor wife at
[47:47] home and that's how things happen
[47:51] eventually I'm just using that as a
[47:52] thought as as as a as an
[47:55] example because saying Saints that's how
[47:57] tricky the devil
[47:59] is and what what s what Satan wants to
[48:02] do is above all things he wants to
[48:05] destroy
[48:07] marriages because he if he can destroy
[48:09] marriages he destroys the family
[48:11] completely and destroys the whole church
[48:14] amen praise God someone said one time a
[48:18] man is what he thinks about all day
[48:22] long yeah that's what you
[48:25] are oh I just think about cars all day
[48:28] long well that's what you
[48:31] are you just that's that's what you are
[48:34] I mean you let you you is the word of
[48:36] God fit in there
[48:38] somewhere does it fit in there somewhere
[48:41] nothing wrong with cars but does the
[48:43] word of God fit in there somewhere amen
[48:46] praise the Lord
[48:47] Jesus look what a poet expressed one uh
[48:50] one day uh he said this he said it this
[48:53] way he said I have a house inside of me
[48:56] a house that others seldom see it has a
[49:00] door through which none pass and windows
[49:04] but they're not of
[49:05] glass where do you live ask folks I meet
[49:10] and then I say on such a street but
[49:13] still I know what's really me lives in a
[49:18] house folks never
[49:21] see that's the heart that's who you
[49:24] really are again you could put on a s
[49:27] before people all day long but God knows
[49:30] that
[49:31] heart and you know what's in your heart
[49:35] amen praise the Lord
[49:40] amen now I don't want to keep you all
[49:42] here too long
[49:44] tonight but um let's talk about the
[49:47] difference between reputation and
[49:49] character
[49:52] amen reputation is what people think you
[49:54] are that's right that's right that's
[49:57] that's your reputation I'm just trying
[49:58] to keep up my reputation you're trying
[50:01] to keep up so what people think you are
[50:05] right but what character is is what God
[50:09] knows you are as he looks upon your
[50:12] heart amen that's character amen that's
[50:15] why brother randam said that character
[50:18] is a victory right because whatever you
[50:21] do in secret when others are not
[50:24] looking that's what count that's what
[50:26] DET that's what tells what your heart
[50:28] really is that's right right see what we
[50:31] do in front of the public that's just
[50:33] our reputation and that's what the
[50:35] public knows that's why Facebook is so
[50:38] tricky social media is so tricky it's a
[50:40] facade most of the time now I'm not
[50:43] saying that there's no there's people
[50:45] there that that don't portray themselves
[50:48] and you know genuinely whatever happened
[50:50] that day I mean if they're eating uh you
[50:52] know a hamburger that day and they
[50:55] whatever that's the picture that they're
[50:57] going to take that's what they are they
[50:59] got it hanging on the side of their face
[51:01] and that they're going to just show what
[51:02] they are right but then some people they
[51:06] just show what they're
[51:07] not right and that's that's that's what
[51:12] social media is about it's displaying
[51:16] your
[51:17] reputation but what really you are is
[51:21] what you do behind the
[51:23] scenes that's the heart amen right so
[51:27] that's what character is character is a
[51:29] victory brother brandom said it's to be
[51:32] able to do the right thing when nobody
[51:35] else is looking amen and that's
[51:39] hard especially when you're driving on
[51:41] the
[51:43] road oh yeah look at y'all Y started
[51:46] smiling and and and uh Well everybody's
[51:49] going 90 miles an
[51:53] hour should you
[51:58] nobody there's no cops around I know
[52:00] there's no cops around this
[52:02] road says 55 speed
[52:05] limit 65
[52:09] 70 now that's
[52:13] character they say well the cops ain't
[52:15] watching me but God
[52:19] is that's that's the tough part
[52:22] amen I it's nice when it gets quiet cuz
[52:26] I know you're talking to the
[52:30] heart amen true character lies in the
[52:34] heart's Purity amen amen amen praise the
[52:37] lord it's deceiving to think what
[52:40] happens inside doesn't matter as long as
[52:42] the outside looks clean that's very
[52:46] deceiving me and that's what the
[52:47] Pharisees did they did amen they did
[52:50] that and and they they they perfected
[52:53] that yes amen because everything was
[52:57] going so well for them until Jesus came
[53:00] on the scene until the manifested word
[53:03] that they thought that they believed
[53:05] really came on the scene and exposed
[53:09] what they really were that's right amen
[53:12] and that's why we don't like it when the
[53:14] word exposes
[53:15] us now a true the a true daughter and
[53:19] son of God likes it when the word
[53:21] exposes you amen a false per a false one
[53:25] doesn't like it
[53:27] amen likes the anointing but doesn't
[53:29] like the reality of what the word can
[53:31] really do for you amen praise the Lord
[53:34] Jesus
[53:36] amen so Jesus says in Matthew chap 15:
[53:39] 19-2 for out of the heart proceed evil
[53:43] thoughts murders adulteries fornications
[53:47] thefts false Witnesses uh blasphemies
[53:51] these are the things which def follow
[53:53] man in other words out of your heart
[53:56] come evil thoughts murder unfaithfulness
[54:00] in marriage vulgar Deeds stealing
[54:02] telling lies and insulting others Jesus
[54:06] said that all of that comes out of your
[54:08] heart am you were born with those things
[54:11] inside of you before you came to the
[54:13] Lord and that's why we always have to
[54:16] guard guard our hearts amen because
[54:19] those things will want to spring back up
[54:21] eventually they will want to amen but
[54:23] that's what we have to do what what what
[54:25] what Solomon said there in Proverbs to
[54:27] guard our heart because out of it comes
[54:30] the the the the things of life amen
[54:33] these are what make you unclean praise
[54:35] the Lord so what's in the heart ruins
[54:38] you outwardly as well amen amen now
[54:42] let's let's just take this last verse
[54:44] here and maybe with this we'll we we'll
[54:45] finish it up in Matthew
[54:47] 12:35 and it says he says here Jesus
[54:50] says a good man notice that it's a good
[54:54] man right out of the good Treasure of
[54:57] the
[54:58] heart bringeth forth good
[55:02] things if it just said there that it was
[55:04] a good
[55:06] man then it could just be a hypocrite y
[55:09] right you can be a good man and not have
[55:11] good treasure in the
[55:13] heart amen you can act and pretend like
[55:17] you're good but not really have good
[55:18] treasure in the
[55:20] heart and we we we see that many times
[55:23] out of the good Treasure of the heart
[55:25] now the the treasure has to be good as
[55:27] well you have to have good treasure what
[55:30] are you feeding on in your
[55:33] life young people what are we feeding on
[55:36] what are we allowing to come into our
[55:38] minds that that that are that are
[55:40] influencing Our Lives that's right they
[55:43] are influencing our thoughts they are
[55:45] influencing the way we talk they are
[55:47] influencing the way we think amen that
[55:51] is what is good treasure and that's what
[55:53] we got to do amen when we when we come
[55:55] to the Lord is to keep feeding on the
[55:57] word of God Amen and as you're feeding
[55:59] on the word of God you're feeding on
[56:01] those good things and you're adding into
[56:02] that Storehouse that Coffer amen good
[56:05] treasure so that you can bring forth
[56:08] good things because you can't bring
[56:11] forth good things if you're feeding on
[56:12] the trash of the
[56:14] world if you're feeding on
[56:17] Netflix and just to make it clear I
[56:19] don't have a Netflix
[56:23] account I deleted that a long time ago
[56:29] I do have Amazon Prime
[56:31] [Laughter]
[56:34] though but many of you do
[56:39] too but what what are we feed I'm not on
[56:41] it though 247 though I do order from it
[56:46] though what are we feeding on young
[56:48] people what are we feeding on
[56:51] adults remember we've got to we've got
[56:54] to add good treasure in the heart they
[56:56] amen so that you can so that if you
[56:58] think right then you can do right
[57:01] right and then he says here Jesus
[57:03] continues to say and an evil man out of
[57:05] the evil treasure bring him for bringeth
[57:08] forth evil things amen it is no surprise
[57:11] it's no it's no surprise that if you're
[57:13] feeding off the the the dirt of the
[57:16] world you're going to be
[57:18] dirty and you're going to look dirty if
[57:22] that is what you're allowing to come
[57:24] into your mind and you're accept it in
[57:26] the heart right and I'm afraid that a
[57:29] lot of us amen we've accepted the the
[57:32] the the education of the world Amen and
[57:36] have accepted it in the
[57:38] heart and now there it's hard to get
[57:41] that out I mean it's it's it's not
[57:43] impossible for the
[57:44] Lord but then you'll see the people amen
[57:48] whatever's in their heart that's what
[57:49] will come out you'll see them act out
[57:52] whatever is in their heart amen so when
[57:55] we're feeding on the good things when
[57:56] we're feeding on the word what's got to
[57:58] come out of that the word right when
[58:01] we're feeding on the right things of of
[58:04] God Amen what has to come out of that
[58:06] the right things of God when you're
[58:08] feeding on the trash of the world then
[58:10] trash will come out amen it's what Jesus
[58:12] is saying here amen but it deals with
[58:15] the heart amen it all stems from the
[58:17] heart
[58:20] amen and they may take a while for all
[58:22] those things to manifest but they
[58:23] eventually will amen
[58:26] what's in the heart will eventually be
[58:28] manifested manifested outwardly
[58:32] amen and let's talk about suppression
[58:35] real quick for just a moment because
[58:38] sometimes we can suppress those things
[58:40] in our
[58:41] lives right some some people can
[58:45] suppress those things and and and not
[58:48] show that that's what I'm doing on the
[58:50] background and they'll suppress it but
[58:52] eventually it comes
[58:54] out right eventually comes out you know
[58:57] I I help my wife uh sometimes I I I cook
[59:01] rice in a pot you know we cook rice we
[59:03] eat a lot of rice at the house and and
[59:06] you put that thing on high you know to
[59:08] to to start cooking and and you can put
[59:10] a lid on top of that pot and that that
[59:13] pot will start cooking that rice in
[59:15] there and you think that that lid will
[59:17] stay on
[59:18] there but that Rice gets hot enough and
[59:20] that pot's there to eventually that
[59:23] lid's going to come off mean you you can
[59:25] you can sit there and hold it in like
[59:27] that but that thing is is moving it's
[59:29] shaking it's cooking it because why
[59:32] whatever is happening on the inside it
[59:34] wants to come
[59:35] out and you can suppress it for a while
[59:38] but eventually that steam is going to
[59:40] find a little crack somewhere around
[59:42] that lid to come out and that's how it
[59:45] is a in the spiritual amen you could
[59:47] suppress things for a while but
[59:50] eventually there's a little crack
[59:52] somewhere and that will come out and
[59:54] really show forth who you are amen
[59:58] really show forth what's happening in
[1:00:01] your life
[1:00:05] amen praise the Lord
[1:00:08] Jesus and look what suppression means to
[1:00:10] put down by Authority or or Force to
[1:00:13] restrain from a usual course or action
[1:00:18] and you could you can artificially
[1:00:19] suppress something but at some point
[1:00:21] amen the reality of it is going to come
[1:00:24] out amen so suppressing your intentions
[1:00:27] your feelings emotions that doesn't
[1:00:30] work that doesn't work eventually every
[1:00:33] what what's in there it will come out I
[1:00:37] put here cough
[1:00:39] suppressant like a like a l La you think
[1:00:43] oh that's going to take my cough away no
[1:00:45] it doesn't only
[1:00:47] temporarily it's a suppression only
[1:00:52] temporarily and they know that that's
[1:00:55] why they want to keep keep you buying
[1:00:57] it it's a suppressant that it only
[1:00:59] suppresses it for just a little while
[1:01:02] amen and eventually that cough of what
[1:01:04] really is it'll come out again you see
[1:01:06] so we can't suppress things in our lives
[1:01:08] amen if it's in our heart amen we've got
[1:01:10] to do something about that amen that's
[1:01:12] right we got to say Lord Jesus help me
[1:01:15] Lord Lord I can't give this up in my
[1:01:17] life but heavenly father I know that you
[1:01:19] are the you are my victory you are my
[1:01:22] you are my helper you are the one that
[1:01:24] can change my heart you are the one that
[1:01:26] can that can turn this thing around for
[1:01:28] me because I can't do it on my own
[1:01:31] amen but if that desire is not in you
[1:01:35] then has Satan gotten in your
[1:01:37] heart and caused you to disbelieve his
[1:01:42] word but I'd say this that if you're
[1:01:45] still here there's a chance for you
[1:01:48] that's right God's not done with you
[1:01:54] amen if if you're still here you haven't
[1:01:57] you haven't send your day of Grace away
[1:01:59] come
[1:02:00] on God is not through with you amen amen
[1:02:04] praise the Lord Jesus
[1:02:07] amen so what is inside the treasury of
[1:02:10] the heart will eventually spill out amen
[1:02:12] praise the Lord Jesus and with that
[1:02:15] we'll just stop right there amen you
[1:02:18] know you you you you hear of so many of
[1:02:20] so many things that you know situations
[1:02:24] and and and and and in life and and
[1:02:27] people you know who you looked up to and
[1:02:30] and you thought my goodness that
[1:02:32] Minister that preacher I mean I mean
[1:02:34] he's just solid as solid can be and then
[1:02:37] and then all of a sudden something just
[1:02:40] happens and in reality wizard really
[1:02:42] wasn't all of a sudden it was a
[1:02:45] transition it was something that to was
[1:02:47] taking place in the Heart All This Time
[1:02:50] amen and we didn't and you don't realize
[1:02:53] it amen but that's how Satan wants to
[1:02:56] get you he doesn't want to he doesn't
[1:02:58] get you right away he gets you little by
[1:03:00] little amen amen and so that's why what
[1:03:03] we need to guard our hearts amen
[1:03:06] especially in the hour that we live in
[1:03:08] that we live in it's so deceiving guard
[1:03:10] our hearts amen and make sure that we
[1:03:14] are taking care of that word that God
[1:03:17] has put in US amen cuz Satan would
[1:03:19] definitely want to rob that from us amen
[1:03:21] praise the Lord Jesus let's stand to our
[1:03:23] feet
[1:03:24] tonight amen if you had the musicians
[1:03:31] come hey man
[1:03:34] let's maybe if we can sing that song uh
[1:03:36] brother Boyd I don't I don't know what
[1:03:38] you had but creating me a clean heart

[1:03:58] that needs

[1:04:06] go from here you might be at a moment
[1:04:08] where where you you know you you're
[1:04:12] confused amen God is not the author of
[1:04:17] confusion Satan is what's gotten you
[1:04:20] confused man God wants to set you free
[1:04:23] amen God wants to deliver your mind God
[1:04:27] wants to deliver your thoughts and align
[1:04:29] your thinking Amen to his word amen
[1:04:32] praise the Lord Jesus and as I said you
[1:04:34] wouldn't be here if God is it was
[1:04:36] through with you and so don't believe
[1:04:38] that lie of Satan that you've already
[1:04:41] sinned too much you've already he's just
[1:04:44] throwing condemnation at you to hinder
[1:04:46] you putting those roadblocks in in your
[1:04:48] life so that you don't come to the truth
[1:04:51] so that you don't come to the word so
