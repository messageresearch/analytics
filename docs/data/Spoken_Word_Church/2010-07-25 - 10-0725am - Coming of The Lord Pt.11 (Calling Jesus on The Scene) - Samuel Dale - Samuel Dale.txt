Earth instead of in Earth every time amen every time you know he's in this Earth You Know amen and and if he's in this earth he'll manifest himself we're going to change the order service now brother Dale's going to come and uh waiting on the message of the day Open the Eyes of My Heart Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord open got no visitor I want to see you I want to how do you want to sing you to see you high and lift it up shining in the light of your morning pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy is he holy I am it up

to see you I always say to you glad for you to be here we don't welcome you as a visitor CU you already been here before so we say good to see you amen if you'd like turnning your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Psalms 118 okay we will also read from Mark 4 now we may have a visitor preaching for us Wednesday and we got to get in touch with brother Burley he's supposed to be bringing some of his people over but we will see about that later you know just remember that remember Wade will be preaching this afternoon so remember him our wife's going to try to come this afternoon to church if she can to uh you know to be with us and she wants to come but just remember her there's one spot there that's really been giv her a lot of problems and they say it's a a normal part of the um operation for that to happen but it's one one spot about that big and it just burns and does things but there's no blood clots no nothing like that that is just a a problem that goes with that form of operation so we ask you to just keep praying for that the Lord would bless him and I heard that they said Brother Dean down preaching for brother Harris today that the Lord will bless him all right Psalms 1118 and Mark 4 and we're going to have our Bible study this coming Saturday but we've got to get together with some of them after service to because there's a birthday conflict into that but we'll see how it'll work out in you know doing what we can do but we will be having the Lord will in our Bible study okay father we thank you we thank you most of all the fact that you gave us salvation amen because without salvation there would be nothing in any of us that would be worth anything but you saved us you chose us and thank you Father we ask ask you now that you would just come and do as you promised and it's not as the prophet said one day it's not hard to ask God to fulfill his word because you promised it so then we just ask you to come that's the simple point of believing you and then we must believe that you are here to make yourself manifest among us we love you and we thank you we ask you to be with each one of these be with the sick remember our wife Lord and just reach down and touch that place that's bothering her so much cuz we know that there's by the the surgery and all father that there's things that will be there but we don't have to relax and let anything be that would be one tormenting thing we can pray and believe that you will take care of all things and we thank you have your way now forgive our sins and just guide each one of us and keep us in Jesus name amen remember next weekend now that uh Wade in June and a good many of you will be up at brother burley's for the Youth Camp so just keep them in mind Wade's got problems with his because his boss is going to have to be operated on Friday so you know it's going to be up and down so remember the travel and the things that would be taking place okay Psalms 118 reading from verse 19 through 26 then we'll go over to Mark 4 open to me the gate of righteousness I will go into them and will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter see that's that's the Gate of righteousness right I will praise thee for thou has heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refuses become the head stone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it save now I beseech thee Oh Lord oh Lord I beseech thee in now Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord amen all right let's go over to Mark 4 we'll begin reading about verse 35 and the same day when e the evening was come he said unto them let's let us pass over unto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full the original says filling you know so as he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillar and they awake him and say unto him Master CEST not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great Cal and he said unto them why are you so a so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to the other what manner of man is this that even the wind the sea obey him you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word I want you to notice they were afraid of the storm right right they were afraid of the storm but when he rebuked it and and peace was still then they afraid of him right because they realize hey this man must be something and even the wind and the waves obeys him right so I think it's thing if you'll notice that throughout the message today I think that's the point I want you to get because being afraid of what takes place in the world is one thing being afraid of being killed being afraid of being run over by a car Etc whatever that's one thing but we should all always be in an attitude of being fearful that's right of not believing God CU that was what he was rebuking him for they had seen great things take place but yet here they was having problems so just you know remember that all right now the Lord willing to I forgot got brother uh George Quinn from Ireland will be with us next Sunday the Lord willing preaching for us I believe that's right there week after next yeah but we can't do it week after next going got the wedding so that's what we done talk about we got to figure out something but brother Quinn will be with us preaching for us in a weekend or so I was thinking he was coming back the 8 to preach but yeah next weekend I got this whole month all messed up okay we'll keep it straight anyway I come to a church we'll be here me today don't worry about it all right cuz I put down on mine and I got dates I guess different but anyhow we've been talking about now on a little subject that I've been concerned with and this is not new for me to preach on this because uh about somewhere a little over 30 years ago I begin to see something that I believe was very important unto each and every one of us and it was the coming of the Lord amen amen and I know there's a lot of things and a lot of ideas and you know we at least should all be away from the uh Lord descended from heaven you know with a shout and a great big you know all over the world and and then aot and we we we can get rid you know pretty well easily get rid of those things amen because we can hear the prophet right but uh I'm wondering do we see it cuz this is my point as I said and this has been my point for over 30 years well over that I quit trying back then I saw something that I realized that we need to know and one of the things was that I quit trying to go to heaven amen amen right you know it's naturally everybody's goal and idea and thoughts are going to heaven right right you know I mean sure but what I mean by that was I begin to realize if the Lord doesn't come here amen that's right and take us D amen then we're not going there amen that's that's the what I begin to realize and then I begin to try to preach on it and uh you know to see that what is the second coming of Jesus Christ now you're a prophet of God said it's the bride coming of Christ amen I gave you all of those quotes trying to back up and review just a little you know he said the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church amen well now that was his definition okay okay so now we got to go with his definition that's right mine and yours don't Mount to a hell of B all right what you think what I think that don't have to do with it cuz that's what happened in the garden the prophet said he said I think and that's what messed the whole thing up now we got to think but just remember we better think according to the word according to his now then we've come to the point of realizing like the prophet said on page 308 of the seal book he said the the second coming is the rapture amen amen then it should be tying together with us to where that we can see that all the things the prophet has taught us are tying together into a beautiful picture right because he said we don't he doesn't come here in a Corporal body he doesn't come phys physically Among Us he said we meet him in the a right all right so the second coming will be to meet the Lord in the act right you say no that's going see that's the problem then we've got to see that the the things that he has told us tying together over all of the time that as we were given to you I think is what the Holy Ghost given for right where he said that Jesus would become visible right Among Us come on Amen and raise the Dead come on and we go into Rapture now then our human mind automatically relates visible to materialistic things you know W flesh whatever but we got to remember the prophet is the one with the answers not you and I right so whatever our brain tells us is always what connected to the senses and the senses has got a problem so then we've got to take what the prophet said amen so he said he become visible Among Us that doesn't mean he becomes Corporal or physical he even as I gave you the other day I can show it to you where he said that these people that say they got blood on their hands and on the forehead and and oil and things he said they don't realize what they're saying right he said because if you have that then you must have the Corporal body you know the physical body would have to be here if you you got the oil you know anything that would come from him if you got the blood especially then you would have to have something real and see that wouldn't tie it together he said they're messing up the scriptures all right so now I didn't say these things and I'm like Paul said have I become your enemy because I found what the prophet said Is that West taken it I've become a lot of people's enemy because I I found where the Prophet said what I was talking about right all right so in doing that then now thinking about the second coming as the bride coming of Christ then we should be realizing that to be among us that God will be here Among Us in such a way and I believe that until he will raise the dead and we'll go into Rapture I believe that amen all right now how does he become visible which I gave you the definitions there Wednesday that visible means to like to see in the eye right or Webster says in other words apparent to the eye something you can see well now brother you're saying that he's not here physically and then you're saying that he's here enough to be able to see him now I I didn't say that brother brandham did all right let's get that straight I didn't have enough sense to say that and neither did you or anybody else go we carnality all right but now then it must be that the prophet he given us the definition right amen of the scriptures all the way through that he can be so real here in you and I until he can change these bodies right right and take us in the Rapture and then we meet him in the a because remember the second coming of Jesus Christ has got to be covered as the bride coming of Christ right then he comes to the two witnesses to Israel but that's not a physical body well now wait wait a minute now now brother the Bible says they say where did you get your nail prints that's true okay so those two prophets makes them so rich until they see the nail prints that's right has not this Prophet made so real to you the death the resurrection Etc of the Lord Jesus Christ and you say you can't see the nail prints in his hands because your Prophet said that would be one thing that would be left even when we get there he will always have those nail prints in his hand where do we see it by Revelation amen so how do we see the resurrection by Revelation right how do we see the change of these bodies by Revelation how do we see these things by Revelation oh that's just head knowledge I didn't say that I've been accused of being intellectual in the basis of that I'm just like a Baptist is just found where the Prophet said it and can read it well okay why hasn't your Holy Ghost found it come on me that's all I got to say I'm not Argan with nobody I just say why has it your holy ghost that you say you have that you are and say I'm just intellect well at least one thing Lula's got it sewed in the seed in the field that's up to God to Quicken it cuz I can't Quicken it brother Rand couldn't Quicken it brother Rand said even the Lord Jesus said my own life did not reveal that unto thee right so now it's got to be the Lord okay now so we hold the point and get it in right doing right see so now the prophets spoke and they done is I was trying to bring Wednesday night before that God could come to the Earth in his first coming the prophets declared that you agree they declared his first coming you know Isaiah and all of them you know virgin shall conceive so when I say something in a minute remember that point and then don't try to make me something that I'm not saying remember the prophets the word we went through it the brother Rand went through the message called Masterpiece where he covers Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph as the foundation then he covers the prophets building the body and then John being the last one to come to introduce the head all right then you have seven Church ages and you are have it there that we're built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets all right just as they were see we're not built on just the apostles we're built upon the apostles and the prophets of what was D because if this is not what was D we better be hunting something else but now we're built on the foundation Apostles and prophets then down through the church ages God has been building a body and the light was to be the prophet of melachi 4 to come to introduce the head so it ties together identically with the scriptures as to where the old and the new is to bring forth then the second coming is not a halfhazard happening right it took 4,000 years to bring to pass the first coming what's the problem would taken 2,000 years to fulfill the second coming CU now ours were that people would differ with me about what I believe I believe the second coming of Jesus Christ started on the day of Pentecost right Amen in the hearts of the Saints where do you think his second coming started if his second coming didn't start in the the new birth then they explain to me why Jesus had to be born amen he had to be born to bring the first coming into being right all right is that sensible right amen see then in the second coming of the Bride coming of Christ coming out of the church well now brother Dale the book of Acts never come out of church you better read the book of Acts and study your prophet's message cuz they were sure a whole bunch of garbage back there right read what the Apostle Paul was saying about it right Grievous wolves among you amen read what was happening in the book of Acts and see if they wouldn't things taking place we want to read about the good things but we want to read about the bad but it was there in the book of Acts cuz the Antichrist John said he's already with us he were looking for the Antichrist to come to last day John said he was already with us now remember what your Prophet said he said what happened back there was that when Jesus Christ came on earth right he said Judas came are you with me but he said when he came back on the day of Pentecost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said the Antichrist came see we want to talk about the Antichrist in the end time well John one that said it he said he's already with you he said he that deny that Jesus is the Christ he Antichrist now so is the second coming the second coming is not complete yet right you know what I mean you say that's a bold statement brother Dale well hey I'm looking at you and you looking at me if your Prophet is right when he said the second coming is a Rapture oh we've been in that thank you I'm glad you're thinking bless it because remember I made a statement I've never preached on it yet your Prophet said the seventh seal is the coming c o m i n coming of the Lord right which means it is a process taking place right amen would you agree to that statement right it's a process taking place but the word come does not have that meaning to it right but he gave us the definition of coming right now the first coming the prophets had to bring it and declare it all right now who was it down through those prophets was it not the word that they were bringing right amen all right is that true the word they were bringing right who was that Christ amen like brother ROM would say I I couldn't understand how Moses could tell God a better way of doing things he said until I realized it was Christ right in Moses amen so now who was it they doing it until they were actually called Gods Come On To Whom the word come to Jesus said right he have any trouble relating to it cuz see he was standing there knowing that he was the Fulfillment of all of those prophets right amen can't you see the wonderful position that this last day Prophet was standing to stand there and see the things amen if the Apostle Paul could say hey brothers you haven't added one thing to what I've said is that what Paul said that's paraphrasing the scripture but that's what scripture said he said you done added one thing to what I said well how much more could this end time Prophet stand and say you haven't added anything to what I've said said because if for certain one thing we better not add to what he said we got a problem in the Bible right all right but getting the point now those prophets actually the word through those men actually delivered unto the world God Almighty in human flesh okay now you know what though if they hadn't said it it couldn't come to pass now let's get on to the message today if they hadn't said what they said Jesus couldn't have come that's right amen it's always he God he can do anything he wants to he can't do anything outside of what his word says that's exactly will do amen so don't go you know up and off with your fancy computer brain and try to Out quote me on it just sit back and listen then later tell me I don't agree with you that's all right but listen the prophets spoke the word and then God made it come to pass right amen okay right and that's the point of the message today okay and you'll get the title in a minute all right now now this was what I was trying to get across this past Wednesday if we don't confess that we're healed then God is not obligated to heal us you ain't do anything he wants to no he can't go contrary to his word right okay that's what your Prophet said now he said God can't go contrary to his word so don't worry about it there's plenty in the word but what I like was the time he said it boy had to swallow but he said if you can find in the Bible what God says and said you can call him on the scene and if he don't do it you can call him a liar right I now bu that's strong right cuz see we was all taught that well God done this and God could do anything he wants to you remember the old saying was uh you know could God create a rock that he couldn't pick up you know all of that doing is trying to to twist our mind it's impossible for him to create a rock that he couldn't pick up right but we think well now wait a minute now well you go on then you go create you a rock and try to pick it up see now listen for you to be healed you've got to say that you are healed amen that's right amen right right now you must speak the word and and then God can come and honor it now you see the background the prophets spoke that word and it produced God in human flesh now you and I must speak the word now according to Romans 10 about verse 9 we must believe in our heart and confess with our mouth before we can be saved is that scripture right but are we like the lady that said the other lady you know said brother Brown was talking one day said this lady said I got the Holy Ghost last night but said don't tell nobody he said now I don't bless you got it that's right that's right that's what he said that's right amen yeah who are you well he was a prophet that's who he was he was just being honest cuz the Bible says it that's right the Bible doesn't just say believe in your heart and you're saved right that's only half of the situation right now if you want a high salvation go ahead and do what you want to but see you must confess right if we're healed we must confess we're healed right amen before God can come on the scene and reveal that now watch what I've been trying to get here's the point now so is it with the second coming of Jesus Christ amen if someone doesn't confess that he's here and it be to real now be real now a't talking about we've been talking about second coming of Jesus Christ ever since he left right amen now that don't mean anything about it they put it in the newspapers right it all over the world that don't mean anything about it right what I said about healing why is it you say by Stripes I'm heal by Stripes I'm Healed you Ain heal he ain't believe you know what it don't come to pipes right now we use that propped up situation Abraham waited 25 years I'm waiting too well that's all right good fine if you're waiting amen my wife gets on to me all the time about she's why in the world you going to the doctor for something you got when you don't tell the doctor what you got so well I was going and say hey Doc how you doing you that's why I talk to them cuz there people that's like you know I put their Brides on like usly and I ain't going to one that's not a Believer but I'll say hey Doc how you doing good great how are you I said I'm doing wonderful what's the matter well I got a bad Cal can you help me get rid of that you know I had something bit me or something on the eye the other day and least and them kept on after me and and until finally I went to the doctor you know to see what it was all right they walk in there and look at it and you know I just I'm just as happy as can be well it could have been a spider I said okay you take this I said okay thank you doc I'll see you later I talked to them like I talk to you one came in one day I've been going to this doctor and he came in walking on crutches you know I mean he had his knee operate on I said first thing I said I said you need to find you a go a good doctor he said that's my trouble I've done found but you see I thank God for doctors amen I take their medicine and their thing but I know who the healer is they told me I had the leukemia I told him right up front I said I am not going to take your chemo do everything else you can do to help me but I won't do it so they run their test and said hey thank God you got the kind of don't kill you okay what it matter to me I'm kind of like my uncle was he was he got married when he was 80 something years old the fourth time and you know he finally died I don't know how old he was he was in his 80s but I told someone I said my Lord something had to get him well you know you can't just keep living but now listen everybody understand see I believe that we must confess that God is here sir now what are you saying when you're saying you're healed what are you saying amen are you saying God is up in heaven now Paul said not to do that that's what he's telling us there in Romans 10 don't say God is up in heaven or over the sea or whatever he said tell him God here well see if you're healed God has to be here to heal you amen it ain't a button up in heaven and he clicks and he down on Earth something happens it's a reality on Earth that thrilled me when I first heard the prophet and I'll read you quote in a minute and remind you of it again he said God busied himself like a father over his family with the children of Israel well you know all I could read all the dirty things he do he said he was just as happy to be back there with him he said like a father with his family see we're going to have to get away from a lot of these things all this that I'm preaching of this series you may not think it but this is a background for some of the simplest messages that I've ever preached in my life all right I want to preach on right n peace but I'm going to preach it in a way that I hope God will make it known for today amen all right now see before God can make manifest that he's here someone must say that he's here all right what did your Prophet say Paul said he's not up in heaven right right Paul wasn't talking about a God in heaven Paul was talking about Christ in you the hope of glory and the life that I now live in the faith you know I live by the faith of the Son of God anybody that's ever seen God doesn't speak of a God in heaven right that's God knows my language and I'm sorry but what good is a god up in heaven bless him your Prophet made it like this one time he said I'd rather have God's word and something to that degree and how him then the how concrete poured 100 ft deep all the way around my child I'd rather have God's word and believe in him right we don't realize God in what he's doing amen before he can take us away he must be here all right now he will come here and make manifest in the visible form that he will be in right and I'm looking for things your Prophet said uh in conduct order Doctrine huh he said after the door the Gentile church is CLO GL will ano the church and he'll do in one year what theologist tried to do in 2000 all right here's where we failed to get the other part but he said he's doing it now right that was about either 59 61 somewhere I know it's back in those all right it's questions and answers book Seven now God is waiting on you and I that's right okay all right he's waiting on you and I right right exactly right he's waiting to see what you'll do amen he's child training you what do you think he's been doing for 40 something years since the prophet has been gone right he's child training his children he's been putting us through trials and tests and problems and heartaches and troubles and seemingly that he's not even with us like you know maybe he's out there in the denominations Healing The Sick more than he is with Among Us what do you think he been doing he's been child training us right amen hey come on folks in the adoption series your Prophet would speak of praying for rain well now in in a monsoon season you don't want to pray for more rain so you know what he's saying it's got to be dry he was down in uh mon in that area down there here in Georgia and uh when he got there it hadn't rained for quite a while that was back in the ' 50s I think 55 somewhere in there and he prayed and rain came well you know there's no need of rain praying for rain if they done had 14 floods right I've tried my best to explain that to you over and over and over how can you how can you manifest God as a Healer if you're never sick amen oh now I don't want to be sick that's right like I was saying there the other day and a brother called me and said he really appreciated but you see job was perfect in God's eyes and God turned him loose to the devil and said get after him do anything you want to but don't take his life that's right you know sometimes we kind of wish that he had had said it like that you know why cuz he couldn't take his wife she was the biggest problem he had right he was one that said tell him you just Curse God and die but see cuz when he said you can't take his life couldn't take hers either that's it cuz she's part of it but he was there because he was perfect amen oh but that don't sound good your Prophet said Satan cannot put anything on to you that God does not allow him to do is that what your Prophet had to say that's right well you mean God made me sick brother BR said he has to slap us down sometimes to get us to be able to sit down and shut up long enough to to listen oh right amen well I think that's what he's been doing for about 40 years now 40 something years he's been slapping us around to see what we'll do isn't it in adoption where that the the tutor goes back and said I made him sick i' done this I turned his friends against him i' done all these things are you listening to the prophet's message that's right he said I've done all those things said now father he's acting just like you now show me where Jesus brother R said he Gran with a headache when he raised uh that n the baby from I believe it was nine that Lazarus when he raised Lazarus he he he sat on a rock and grown with a headache oh God didn't well your Prophet said it that's all right now listen here's what I'm trying to get to God is waiting on you and I to confess that he's here right now here's where we go I don't want to lie that's what people do you never talk to people that that you say well now what you need to do is confess you you're healed well I'm not healed and I don't want to lie about it you ain't never heard people say that uh come on you ain't never said it yourself you know what I'm going to I'm call you a liar if you say you don't you hadn't so that's just the best way to just put the liar out there cuz see that's automatically the first thing I'm not healed I still got the lump I still got the problems I still got the troubles I don't want to lie when God takes it all away I'll tell everybody it'll never go away the doctor can't take it away nothing can't take it away why cuz you're accepting what you got you're a liar to say that you're sick cuz the Bible says what is it we sing that song it's coming out of the song let the sick say that they're well isn't that the scripture right when you sound like you're gloring in being sick no no no I got I'm beyond that now folks don't accuse me a lot of things accuse me something but than that I don't want to be sick right and I don't say well God now I'm sick for your honor and Glory no I say God what did I do cuz that's what we do as humans right well what did job say God what did I do one of these days I want to preach a message out of job got something the other day where you know have you ever noticed that he said back to them buddies of his he said if you was in the shape I was in you know what he went on to say he saidou accusing me of doing these things and said you've done things too he said what if I brought them up we don't want that shot of it oh no no no no no one people come to me and they say brother Dale I'm sick I said okay let's pray if you've done anything wrong go straighten it up now he said what I don't believe I've done anything wrong well then all right the prophet said if you've done everything yielded yourself confessed all your wrongs and you're still sick he said stand right there now I'm a direct quoting he said because God is trying you but see oh we want it on the Glory Glory Glory side all of it right this ain't no glory thing it's glorious in what God has revealed unto us amen but now watch see the second coming of Jesus Christ has been a mystery right right never to be comprehended by mankind Until the End Time amen even though it was taking place right the first coming of Jesus Christ was not comprehended right right that's right the Jews had it figured out he was coming yeah yeah figured out the great big as the prophet said that that great big thing would be rolled out and and it roll right up to cus you know the high priest and Jesus would walk right up to him and say you know I finally got here you foke of me all this time and you know no the first coming of Jesus Christ was a direct mystery hidden in the word that many things would happen in there even that the Gentile garbage canned dogs would come into this picture yep that Rahab the Harlot and and and basba would come into all of those things right that's right right garbage cans would happen but it would bring to Pi that's right I don't believe the garbage can brought it to Pi no it was just there I don't agree with a lot of these things preached about that you know how that Tamar and Judah was in the will of God now they was it was in adultery but was just used to bring a natural seed cuz the seed they brought was not Christ right the woman that brought Christ had to be a virgin amen not adultery that's reason I don't go along with all these things now listen remember what I stated that I believe cuz I don't mind telling you what I believe you know you get preachers up and they'll preach it this way and they preach it that way and after while they get one side of the congregation holler amen and when they do they just start preaching it that way you know they just run with that they go to another congregation and the left hand side picks it up and they just run it that way you tell me it don't happen now can I just tell you what I believe I believe the second coming of Jesus Christ started on the day of Pentecost when the new birth struck into the heart of man what are you talking about in the second coming if the first coming was God in human flesh come on what would be the second coming your Prophet kept saying God in human flesh amen that's what's got to be here before we're going to be taken out of here listen to what your Prophet had to say now go to your notes on number one on Christ The Mystery of God revealed and listen to it I at least try to bring to you what the prophet said and I encourage you to read the whole message 1963 728 all right and all these things tped him just in time but yet the mystery was hid them men didn't know what they were doing they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do something now holding it back listen in the last days for the great Revelation now he's jumped all way over here right right but expressing it expressing himself in Moses and David and Joseph and Elijah on down true you we we could take each one of those prophets and bring their lives out and sure it express Jesus Christ perfectly exactly yet never giving his secret in full right amen waiting for to make it known in the last days as he promised listen waiting for it to be fully comprehended before he could express it if he told the whole thing because the Bible's written in mystery Jesus thank the father they was wrote in Mysteries right waiting for it to be comprehended understood now brother R says God first what he does it then he reveals it and then he'll make it manifest no so he's waiting for it to be understood now we believe the new birth was down to the ages right but we believe also that the bride during those ages was caught up in Catholicism so it would have to be the end time that something would have to take place but then you can see that it's the bride coming of Christ is coming out of the church right amen Martin Luther came out of the Catholic church right but brother Dale I never been in the church well then you just born one right Born between the serpent and Eve now not the Beast and Eve brother R didn't say that he said you're born between the serpent and E what you're born in a mind of carnality and we got to be birt out of that the new birth doesn't give you another mind or brain that's right it only gives you eternal life in your soul but if you can't see that's his coming into you you got a problem right all right now how did the prophet say it he comes three times first he comes to redeem his bride next he comes to get his bride the next time he comes with his bride okay easy to see number one easy to see number three right right look back at the first coming look over to there and we right back in the Millennium right all right but what about coming in his bride amen well I can see it in brother Brandon and I don't have to see it in nobody else well oh my okay brother Brand's on one going that's right sorry that's right you differ with me whatever you want to do that's just blun to me that's just the way I see it right brother randam didn't give you a new birth right the Lord Jesus Christ can only give you a new birth that's why I was quoting while ago that Jesus said my own life didn't reveal that because the prophet Christ the my God reveal he said the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the word right so while Jesus was here in flesh he could not reveal that's right anything about those things and as a matter of fact your Prophet said he did not know about his second coming now better put another quote in there he spoke more of his second coming than he did his first coming so you better get it right now yeah he said he didn't know when he's coming back but said after he come to John on patmas then he realized then why because it starts off on patmas what Revelation the Revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John amen then he knew about his part in the second coming and he could see what was transpiring if you see it anything outside of the new birth and the growth development into you you know and to where that we come up to a place that the word will be so prevalent in us that it will change these bodies and we'll go into Rapture then you go ahead and believe what you want to believe that's that's just the way I believe it now say who are you well that's same thing to you who are you right no problem but listen waiting for it to be fully comprehended ended you said what was he talking about there if talking about the mystress why I invite you to go back to the whole book because the whole book of Christ The Mystery of God revealed is the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ right in a three-fold revelation what all God was he poured into Christ all Christ in the church and to take her back to the Garden of Eden or restore Fallen Eve right I believe it's Fage 74 Christ of mystery that brother Brandon said the bride is part of the mystery and she must be revealed right I'll give you another one that's God of this evil age I'm pretty sure I'm looking at the quote but in my mind but he said that God is not complete without you that's exactly right even said to godhead is not complete without you now waiting in the this day now listen to the point of what I'm trying to get now Israel believed in a historical God they were down in Egypt they had lost Joseph they lost the contact of knowing god they had come out of it as a historical point now you are you listening in other words you know what I mean by historical they came him out of it caring the Scrolls they came out of it carrying even Moses with the Scrolls and so much until Moses and the things that would take place but yet they never did believe it you said they didn't well right how about when he come over there and said well let's go up and they said no we don't want to go up right well the next day they changed their mind but you know what happened by the next day God had said you're not going so they said we're going well they lost a bunch of people and they come back knuckled under Moses and tried to believe now those were human people trying to believe without the baptism of the Holy Ghost the waiting in the days of the children of Israel was on the problem of the people it was not on God's problem right God had Moses out in the wilderness the whole time right for 40 years he's on the backside that's right 40 years God was waiting on Israel brother Brandon said they had to be crying out for a deliverer before God seen it right amen okay now but Moses was there ready all the time see God's been ready all of this time but he's waiting on you and I right he's waiting on you and I to do something that is very sensible let's read a little bit now lifting God out of History I would invite you to listen to that message uh await Jesus and then calling Jesus on the I think he's two or three of those this is preached 1958 101 he's talking about a historical that's a historical God that give the promise see what's underlined there now to start there and we're the people today of his pastor with a sheep of his fold and he's waiting on us to stand and call him on the action call him on the scene watch him go in to move us watch him do the Supreme watch him do the thing that man will wonder and scratch their heads and not understand he's a historical God and a present day God he's waiting to be called out of History Israel had a historical God you know they believed in right but when God appeared They Crucified him right so he's still historical ever present water from the rock 61723 this great Pentecostal move today now how much great signs and wonders and all was among the Pentecostal group when brother was preach brother R was preaching back there the 40s 50s and up into the 60s look and this great Pentecostal move today God is waiting for you to call him on the scene you're not out of speaking distance with him listen though we've done wrong and sinned and turned their backs on him think of the children of Israel that I said a minute ago and all the dirty things they've done but God was right there with them 10 times they sinned against him before they become to C Baria and they were ready to go across and God would have still took them but they disbelieved his word amen all the other things was disbelieving this disbelieving that gripping and complaining about this and that and the other in the wilderness but when they disbelieved his word he said Into the Wilderness you go until you get rid of all of that so look though we've done wrong and sinned and turned backs on him and and done things we ought not to do but yet he's with us Christ said he would be with us the Bible says the waters followed the children of Israel when they got thirsty they know the water was near all the garbage that was taking place but it still fed awaking Jesus 631 117 you know what he's doing he's here tonight waiting to be proved that's right you you know what we ought to do we ought to do like they like they wait Jesus that's in us they woke him up in a boat right right now this is not waking him up in a boat right this is waking him up in where in Soul wake Jesus that's in Us Wake Jesus in our lives the god that set our souls a fire with the Holy Ghost amen the god that taken these blinded eyes of mine and opened them up the God that raised me off of a death bed the God that I seen bring the dead back after being dead for hours the doctor pronounced dead and write a statement to five different times waken that God wake him up we to call Jesus and wake him up he going down this waken him call him on the scene me and that computer that printer we have a problem if I don't get it exactly right he prints it sideways I guess he's trying to tell me what I am calling Jesus on the scene 1963 80 I think it's time when Trouble Comes that we say to those say to those disciples who must have said let's go wake him let's go call him let's call him on the scene oh my beloved brother my lovely sisters I love you and and remember I'm telling you the truth if you got trouble tonight he's right at hand he can be called on the scene by just a move of your lips he'll come on the scene amen call Jesus on the scene wait Jesus for we have him with us and he's the same yesterday today and forever remember the other wasn't with us it was in us who do you pray to as a prophet said one day calling Jesus on the scene the same message but it's paragraph 120 that was 118 if we could only realize that he's here with us the same yesterday today and forever Lo I'm with you always I'll never leave you never forsake you I am with you to the end of the world do we believe that well why don't we go haywire when things go wrong right right why don't you go haywire when things go wrong if he's in you where you going to Hy come on brother oh I needed to get a couple of weeks prayer meeting and fast and cry and pray oh that's wonderful but brother R said Joshua I believe said he didn't have to stop and pray he said he only had to say he said because he's prayed through for the world Amen he didn't have time to stop and pray did you amen but Matthew 4 I'll never leave you again he said oh again I'll never leave you nor forsake you I was just looking at the scriptures I had wrote down here concerning how can we be sure by his proven word he is now waiting for you to call him on the scene to be proved so let's go and await Christ in our lives how do you awake Christ now how do you awake Christ in your life your prophet's answering it right by believing his word faith brings him on the scene that's what brings him on the scene Faith then call on him to confirm his word and don't doubt in fear don't do that just believe him as it is written and let it be done and God will prove to you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we worship an invisible God Amen go away Jesus 63103 he talking about Boven and the composers and the songs then if Christ lives in me my if Christ lives in me the works of Christ will be done through me certainly if bethoven Lives in You The Works of bethoven will be made known if Christ lives in you the works of Christ will be made known for he is the same same he can't change remember what I said he's Eternal he can't change he's the same yesterday today and forever well then call him on the scene are you afraid to is Men Of This Hour as men of this day afraid to call Jesus on the scene to say Lord you promised it now do it right you remember what I said when I first read the scripture the disciples were afraid of the water the problems they were in that was one form of fear of dying would you remember what we read they were more afraid when they realized who was in the boat with them reach your Bible they were afraid because they realized this man could stop the winds and the waves do you actually want God to come in your Pres presence come on brother that's a good question come on your Prophet preached the message do I have to emphasize a lot of it he said if you can't turn around in the clothes you got on and face the Lord Jesus that's men women whatever right he didn't say women only you know if you can't turn around and face Jesus you're afraid right amen and you say you have the new birth does our actions and reactions show that we would be willing for him to walk right down through here I've told you many times I believe in the FF Ministry I believe there's prophets in the five-fold ministry we're not looking for another Prophet to come no but there's prophets in the fivefold ministry right and if I knew a brother had a real genuine gift of calling out our sins I'd call him up and get him here amen but I wonder how many of you would come oh you'd have an excuse I'm married a wife I tried to I sold a dog I bought a cow I've done something went wrong I can't come I'm honest fol right amen would you be willing for somebody to sit down and call out your sins amen oh yeah yeah yeah yeah but what about when you started it's like brother Tatum used to go to brother Jack Co you know brother random done it a lot and then the Lord you know he he quit doing it brother Tatum said there in the lines of Jack Cole said he'd call him out you're living in adultery with that man right back there he said what just a minute there was nobody in the prayer line everybody goes and sit down why they don't want their sins called out brother R said it calls lawsuits and killings and things if I told what God showed me amen you know many of you I said Brother D tell me what my problem is and you know to this day I would never told anybody number one I got another problems myself but number two I don't want to lose you as my friend man at work one time a real friend of mine wonderful guy he told me some problems he had in his life from that day on he was never my friend because he's exposed what he was and he knew what I believed about it I don't want to lose you I know you think I do you think I try to run you off when I say hey go out the door just make sure the door don't hit you but be careful now cuz it kind of you got to push pretty good to get out of them and you know why the reason we had to do that cuz you bunch of stubborn old people not the kids stubborn old people go out the door the door is going back and forth we done it because of you you won't do it now you won't slam it now there's always ways of taking care of things but listen folks brother brandom said are we afraid to call God on the scene oh yeah you're going down the road and you see a truck coming your way oh Jesus help me and about that time the truck goes off the road you going down the highway that's right and then you say like the fell said you know it was sitting out on the creek Bank the two guys they was fishing on Sunday morning and one of them said to the other one you know when he heard the church bells ringing You' heard it so we would I should have went to church this morning the other one said well I couldn't cuz my wife was sick okay the truck runs off the highway you're going down the road then where you going the church is back the other way yeah thank God then the next Sunday you come and want to testify right I want to tell the testimony so want a testimony oh I'm not going to tell you where I was going but there was a car you know truck okay that's what I get but I don't never tell you can't tell you testimony right that's right am are you afraid going down below there same quote same message paragraph 71 that's paragraph 770 if you're afraid to wait Jesus in your life that's been asleep for a while see are you afraid to wait Jesus is in your life that's been asleep for a while are you afraid to wait that thing that a few years ago that come down upon you and filled you with his Blessing oh my are you afraid to wake him up say Lord Jesus I'm in trouble tonight move on the scene for me in sailing the Seas I've been stricken with disease I'm Afflicted help me Lord help me oh Lord help me are you afraid to you call him on the scene no when you can call him on the scene like those disciples all doubt takes it seat sets back Faith raises up doubts are no longer I'm honest my wife says I'm too honest you know if I know I've done something wrong and I get sick I don't ask God to heal me I ask him to kill me did you understand what I said yeah yes I said if I know I've done something wrong right and I get sick I'll go to the doctor take what he's got and fight it out why because I'm not worthy to ask him to heal me how do you feel he said well bud you sure a strange guy I agree with you no problem but I'm honest what do you do go out and live like a garbage k out of church do what you want to go do this do that and then something happens to you and then you say God what did I do wrong don't ask God what you do wrong you you know what you do wrong don't ask brother Dale what you do wrong you know what you do wrong amen right come on look what he gets on let me H you read all what I gave you looked on the number nine on your notes calling Jesus on the scene preach 1964 uh 3:19 notice after these disciples found themselves at the end it must have doned on them of doned on some of them that the Creator was still with them I hope it does that to us tonight amen of Hebrews for Hebrews 13:8 says he the same then what did they do they awaken Jesus gowake Jesus wake him call him on the scene he's very easy called you remember the prophet where he explained how that he went down when he was invited down and he knew they was going to make fun of him he still went he he very easily called they had seen so many things that God had done and the and the words of vindicating him so have we and he was not hard to be called into action to woke him up and said do you car us not that we perish you say how can we be sure of this can we prove it John 14:12 Jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also that's exactly our faith brings Christ in our presence amen right what about the next one calling Jesus on the scene 64319 notice when you call him on the scene notice let us awake him back above there I got a circle where you say we see his promises then call him to confirm his word and the thing that he promised to do the way he he we would know in the revelation of Jesus Christ in the last days would be like it was in the days of Sodom he promised that Revelation to the church when he would be revealed so don't doubt and fear call him on the scene for it's to awaken him in our s ourselves call him on the scene remember the rock never left Israel never present water from the rock Israel left the rock it forgot about the rock being with them all the time it was right there went right with them to the end of the road it followed them it wasn't out of speaking distance it wasn't out of hearing distance or it wasn't out of seeing distance and neither is Christ with the church today he's not out of speaking distance some of you have backslid and done that which is wrong and you lost that joy and your water is dried up he's still in speaking distance of you he follows you he knows every move you make and everything you do he's longing to hear you call him on the scene call him on the scene 1964 319 now can't your faith come come to that can't we call him on the scene call him on the scene your faith is the only thing that can do it now you believe that with all your heart each one of you now listen to this one we quit believest thou this 19642 paragraph e29 why you say Mr Moody now Mr Moody wasn't living in this day that's right we're living on the coming of the Lord and we just took it for granted that he was with our Kindred but the other day when a challenger challenged Mr Graham we found out that he wasn't among wasn't among our kin folks you remember when he was challenged overseas Billy Graham brother R said well that he should have called for some of his brothers to come in other words already to call for him to come let it be settled you know but said better still now I'm quoting it you go find it he said better still he already have called he said CU God would have kept his word are you willing when death is facing you but he said we left our Pentecost we've left our Pentecost that's where we left him now you know the story what he's telling come on brother musicians he's telling you the story a word that Jesus this brother Jal Hughes was bringing out the other day really enjoyed it that 3 days they had left him 3 days they went you know didn't hunt him three more three days they left him tried to find him when they found him they said your father and I brother R said see there she denied the Virgin birth you think you don't do that you think I don't do that but he said I must be about my father's business but to show that he was God and what he was doing the Bible said he went home and
