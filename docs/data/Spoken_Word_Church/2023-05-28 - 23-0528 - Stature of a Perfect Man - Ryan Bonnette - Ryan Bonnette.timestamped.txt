[0:13] and then also communion Second Sunday
[0:15] this month
[0:19] okay
[0:21] and brother Joe if y'all can get the
[0:23] PowerPoint connected I'm not sure if
[0:25] it's
[0:26] if I did everything right here to make
[0:27] it work
[0:31] there it is okay
[0:39] and then we're gonna go ahead and open
[0:40] repair again for this just for the
[0:42] Sunday School lesson here father would
[0:43] probably just bless this lesson what
[0:45] would you know how I've told over this
[0:46] to try to prepare it for your people or
[0:47] to pray you let it be a blessing to them
[0:49] just help them and just help me to just
[0:51] take it slow and easy and just just
[0:53] teach you the best that I can I want to
[0:55] pray and let it be a blessing to your
[0:56] people in Jesus name amen
[0:59] this morning I want to talk about the
[1:00] Statue of perfect man I don't like to
[1:03] kind of get off the beaten path you know
[1:05] what's being preached and being taught
[1:07] whenever I'm asked to teach I'm a
[1:08] substitute so you know I just don't want
[1:10] to get everybody in mind wandering away
[1:12] from from what we're being taught right
[1:14] now so brother Wade he's been on the
[1:16] Statue of perfect man been talking about
[1:18] um
[1:18] uh the son of man who is the son of man
[1:21] such a perfect man brother bald's been
[1:23] on faith and in the book of Hebrews
[1:25] chapter 11. talk about Vindicated life
[1:28] the life that's in the blood and Cain
[1:30] and Abel about them making choices and
[1:32] all that so we're going to try to stay
[1:34] right along on those same paths talking
[1:36] about the life of God the statue of
[1:37] perfect man coming and being manifested
[1:39] in our lives individually and um
[1:43] so a quick little uh something that
[1:45] helps me understand this kind of like
[1:47] this I'm going to do a comparison of the
[1:49] Lord himself uh with this statue of man
[1:53] because it's the statue of Christ it's
[1:54] his own stature it's his own attributes
[1:57] or his own characteristics so if you
[1:59] take like any person you could take any
[2:02] one of you or any or me and and say like
[2:04] if you wanted to be like one person I
[2:07] know better than I know anybody is my
[2:08] wife so I'll just use her for an example
[2:10] if you say Ryan how would I be like
[2:12] Gabby and then I'd say well first of all
[2:14] you got to be real bashful if I want to
[2:16] talk about the Statue of Gabby I want to
[2:18] say you need to be backward in bashful
[2:19] very meticulous because all these years
[2:22] that I've known her every little project
[2:24] or craft I see her do she's so
[2:26] meticulous she'll work at it for hours
[2:28] and hours and hours on these little
[2:30] crafts and things so you got to be
[2:32] meticulous and pay attention to detail
[2:34] and then you got to be patient because
[2:36] I'm not patient enough to spend hours on
[2:38] a project like that but if you're going
[2:39] to be a gabby you got to be patient and
[2:41] those are just a few of the things that
[2:43] we could go with each person
[2:44] individually here and name some of your
[2:46] characteristics some of the things that
[2:48] you're born with it's just part of your
[2:49] who you are and this is the character of
[2:51] Christ this is who he is and this is uh
[2:55] basically him saying be perfect here's
[2:58] how we'll get to that slide here in a
[3:00] minute
[3:02] so that's the best that basically that I
[3:04] understand the stature perfect man is
[3:05] these are the characteristics of the
[3:07] Lord himself
[3:10] okay Jesus first comment was overlooked
[3:13] by many people because they were not
[3:15] looking for him correctly according to
[3:16] the way the Bible said he would come
[3:19] he comes to those who are really looking
[3:21] for him correctly according to the
[3:23] scripture
[3:24] he came the first time just as he would
[3:27] as he said he would he's come the second
[3:29] time in his bride so that's where we
[3:31] look for him in the bride first John 4
[3:34] hereby know we the spirit of God every
[3:36] spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ
[3:38] is come in the flesh is of God and you
[3:41] know by the way he's been talking about
[3:42] the son of man John 1 and begin with the
[3:44] word with God Word was God now the word
[3:47] made flesh God Among Us it was in Christ
[3:49] but now it's in us and that's what he's
[3:52] been putting all the emphasis on is that
[3:54] that word has been made flesh in US
[3:56] so we're being we should start to see
[3:59] these characteristics in the stature
[4:00] perfect man reflected in our own life
[4:03] behold what manner of love the father
[4:05] hath bestowed upon us that we should be
[4:07] called the sons of God therefore the
[4:10] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[4:11] not beloved now are we the sons of God
[4:14] and doth not yet appear what we shall be
[4:16] but we know that when he shall appear we
[4:19] shall be like him so we'll have his
[4:21] characteristics
[4:24] for we shall see him as he is and every
[4:27] man that hath this hope in him purifies
[4:29] himself even as he is pure
[4:31] so as I said we're doing a comparison of
[4:34] his life and the statue perfect man
[4:37] okay there's this is a like an endless
[4:39] subject this is not something you can
[4:41] cover in a 30-minute lesson so I'm just
[4:43] going to kind of take some of the
[4:44] examples that stand out to me that put
[4:47] on display that stature perfect man and
[4:50] the life of the Lord himself
[4:52] because it's it's not hard to find a lot
[4:55] of examples
[4:56] second Peter according to the divine
[4:58] power given unto us let's just go and
[5:00] Skip on down verse five and beside this
[5:02] given all diligence add to your faith
[5:03] virtue and to Virtue knowledge into
[5:05] knowledge Temperance and the temperance
[5:07] patience into patience godliness and
[5:09] regardless brotherly kindness and in
[5:11] brotherly kindness charity
[5:13] if these things being unabound they make
[5:15] you that you shouldn't either be bare
[5:16] nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[5:18] it doesn't say virtue difference and all
[5:21] that it says knowledge right there so it
[5:24] must be talking about
[5:25] the whole scope this is knowing the Lord
[5:27] what I'll say in the beginning talk
[5:28] about I know my wife Gabby and I know
[5:30] her stature I know her characteristics
[5:33] This Is Us no one coming to know the
[5:34] Lord and knowing his stature his
[5:36] characteristics and it being made alive
[5:38] in us manifested in US
[5:40] nor approval and then knowledge of our
[5:42] Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh
[5:44] these things as blind cannot see it far
[5:46] off and hath forgotten that he was
[5:47] purred from his old sins or for the
[5:49] rather brethrenic diligence that you
[5:51] make your calling and elections sure for
[5:53] if you do these things you should never
[5:54] fall
[5:55] there's so many interest shall be
[5:56] Minister unto you abundantly into the
[5:58] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[5:59] Savior Jesus Christ
[6:01] Matthew 5
[6:03] this is some of the things again that
[6:04] you'll do if you have the character of
[6:05] Christ this is him on display but I say
[6:08] unto you uh we're going to skip down in
[6:10] verse 44. I know it's really small it
[6:12] says 44 is about halfway down I say unto
[6:14] you love your enemies bless them that
[6:16] curse you do good to them that hate you
[6:19] and that's not natural human nature to
[6:21] do that this is all contrary to Human
[6:23] Nature pray for them I should spitefully
[6:25] use you and persecute you that you may
[6:27] be the children of your father which is
[6:29] in heaven before you make the sun to
[6:31] rise on the evil and on the good sendeth
[6:32] rain on the just and the unjust for if
[6:35] you love them which love you what reward
[6:37] have you do not even Republicans the
[6:39] same and if you salute your brethren
[6:41] only what do you more than others do not
[6:43] even the public and so be therefore
[6:45] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[6:47] perfect so as I said a minute ago he's
[6:49] saying be perfect
[6:51] here's how this is the statue of perfect
[6:53] man talking about the Statue of Our Lord
[6:56] and it's
[6:58] there's a lot of detail on this let's uh
[7:00] define stature quality or status gained
[7:03] by growth development or achievement so
[7:06] it just basically means growing up it
[7:08] basically means coming to maturity
[7:10] and while I was looking it up I stole it
[7:12] down beneath this
[7:13] um that definition there Google was it
[7:16] said what is the spiritual meaning of
[7:18] stature
[7:19] spiritual stature is a product of the
[7:21] molding hands of the Potter upon the
[7:24] clay it is the molding hand of God that
[7:26] produces stature with God it comes from
[7:29] our obedient responses to God's dealings
[7:31] in our life and it is usually
[7:33] accompanied with much pain and suffering
[7:36] so that was from Google thanks Google I
[7:38] didn't see that one coming that was uh
[7:40] unexpected a little nugget there
[7:42] somebody posted that on there if you can
[7:45] get that get that point to understand
[7:47] this is uh brother Dale from 2019 uh
[7:50] September 15th if you can get that point
[7:53] to understand what faith really is
[7:56] then it'll be easy to be able to say add
[7:59] virtue because it's the same material
[8:01] all right it's not a different material
[8:03] it's the same material added to it
[8:05] virtue and knowledge would be the same
[8:07] material Temperance patients calling us
[8:09] and all be the same material okay so
[8:12] you're not having to try to figure out
[8:13] so if you just ever find out what faith
[8:15] really is and get that and you're
[8:17] understanding then you'll see what these
[8:19] virtues really are it's just adding
[8:21] Faith to Faith to Faith to Faith or
[8:24] Revelation Revelation opening God's word
[8:26] to each one of us
[8:27] that's God and simplicity there's
[8:29] nothing hard about this it's I know it I
[8:32] just read on the previous slide there's
[8:33] pain and suffering that comes with it
[8:35] all these trials we go through are part
[8:36] of it but God always gives us Grace to
[8:38] overcome he never puts on us more than
[8:39] we can stand that's all part of it and
[8:42] but it's not something so great that we
[8:44] can't attain to it okay it's not
[8:46] something's out of our reach it's in the
[8:47] reach of every one of us
[8:51] I think I just yeah this one's from
[8:57] yeah next one here this one's from
[8:59] Brother Bob
[9:00] about a year ago April last year as the
[9:02] word is revealed to you your life begins
[9:04] to change as you partake of the word
[9:06] he's claiming you he's actually taking
[9:09] possession of you he's claiming your
[9:10] life until he caps off everything that
[9:12] he's claimed with the headstone he caps
[9:14] off your possession what is it every
[9:16] word that you hear and receive it's like
[9:18] God putting a little flag over you
[9:20] saying this is mine this is mine and
[9:22] when he claims it it's not going back
[9:24] when he claims your soul it can't go
[9:26] back when it adds virtue it can't go
[9:28] back when he has knowledge it can't go
[9:30] back it'll never be taken away and
[9:32] claims your life and it's now under his
[9:34] possession he's putting that little flag
[9:36] over you saying this is mine now this is
[9:38] why the Bible I believe Solomon Chapter
[9:40] 2 says he brought me to the banqueting
[9:41] house the place where I'm going to eat
[9:43] to sit down and at the table and His
[9:47] Banner his little flag over me was love
[9:48] he's claiming me as I eat the word both
[9:51] of them basically just said the same
[9:53] thing you're eating the word you're
[9:54] becoming the word did you eat the word
[9:56] this is a daily like brothers was saying
[9:58] Wednesday night just to mundane so it is
[10:00] kind of mundane to our flesh it's not
[10:02] entertaining to sit down and read the
[10:03] Bible if you roll beside me in the
[10:05] chicken truck you could be bored stiff
[10:07] all I do is drive and listen to sermons
[10:09] and drive and listen to sermons you
[10:11] would be like banging your head against
[10:12] the wall my life is incredibly boring
[10:15] sometimes okay but you're gonna see a
[10:18] little nugget on that if you didn't see
[10:19] it Wednesday night I got another little
[10:20] example that goes along with that here
[10:21] in the Lord's life
[10:24] Luke 2 this is the Amplified version he
[10:26] went down to Nazareth with them and was
[10:29] continually submissive and obedient to
[10:31] them and his mother treasured all these
[10:33] things in her heart and Jesus kept
[10:35] increasing in wisdom and in stature by
[10:38] most natural proof of man in stature he
[10:39] kept growing
[10:41] and in favor with God and Men
[10:48] so let me back up to that Jesus did not
[10:49] need salvation as I said last time I'm
[10:52] talking about that in great drama this
[10:53] is all a great drama and he's acting it
[10:55] out he's a he's a character in his own
[10:57] play okay he didn't need salvation but
[10:59] he came and played the role he acted it
[11:02] out of what it takes to be a baby and
[11:05] then come through life through struggles
[11:07] and then come to consecrate yourself to
[11:09] Christ at a very young age is what he
[11:11] did and then
[11:13] growing in Grace and knowledge and the
[11:15] encounter status man and then come into
[11:17] a Ministry or whatever God has for you
[11:19] to do in in life and you know and just
[11:23] going out to living out this whole
[11:25] entire Earth Journey he was a character
[11:27] in his own play and not that he needed
[11:30] salvation but he just acted it out for
[11:32] us to show us what to do he was our
[11:34] example
[11:36] he was never lost he was born in Jehovah
[11:39] so Hebrews 5 so also Christ glorified
[11:42] not himself to be made in high priest
[11:44] but that he said unto him Thou Art my
[11:46] sons today by begotten thee he said also
[11:48] another place thou the priest Forever
[11:49] After the order of Melchizedek who in
[11:52] the days of his flesh when he had
[11:53] offered up prayers and supplication with
[11:55] strong crying and tears unto him that
[11:56] was able to save him from Death was hurt
[11:59] and that he feared though we were son
[12:01] yet learned he obedience by the things
[12:03] which he suffered and being made perfect
[12:05] he became the author of Eternal
[12:07] salvation he's writing that play as he
[12:09] lived it out on Earth he's he's writing
[12:11] this great drama and writing himself
[12:14] into it and writing our part into it
[12:16] author of Eternal salvation of them that
[12:18] obey him called of God in high priest I
[12:20] have to order Melchizedek
[12:22] in John 10
[12:24] the Jews answered I'm saying for good
[12:26] works don't we not but for blasphemy
[12:29] because that thou being a man maketh not
[12:30] a self God Jesus answered him is not
[12:32] written in your law I said you are Gods
[12:34] so he's the one that said that it's in
[12:36] the law of God you are Gods if he called
[12:39] them gods to the word of God came to and
[12:42] scripture cannot be broken save him whom
[12:44] the father is Sanctified and sent to the
[12:45] world without Blasphemous because I said
[12:47] I am the son of God
[12:49] hope one of that one quoted there is
[12:51] just to say that the scripture shows you
[12:52] are Gods that's God becoming one with
[12:55] flesh again
[12:56] first John 4 beloved believe not every
[12:59] Spirit but try the spirits where they
[13:00] are of God because many false prophets
[13:02] gone out into the world hereby know ye
[13:04] the spirit of God every spirit that
[13:06] confesses Jesus Christ is come in the
[13:08] flesh as I've gone
[13:10] and every Spirit confesses not that
[13:12] Jesus Christ come to the flesh is not of
[13:13] God and this is that Spirit of
[13:14] antichrist wherever you've heard it
[13:16] should come and even now is already in
[13:17] the world
[13:18] okay
[13:20] so word being made flesh now
[13:23] as this is a picture of the two the
[13:26] disciples on the road to Emmaus this is
[13:28] after death burial and resurrection of
[13:30] the Lord and he appeared to them as they
[13:32] were walking and talking about the Lord
[13:34] that's where he always comes around when
[13:35] you're worshiping him he inhabits your
[13:37] Praises when you talk about him think
[13:38] about him meditate on his word and
[13:41] anything you do that's spending time
[13:42] with the Lord reading his word or
[13:44] whatever he comes around he's always
[13:46] faithful to do that
[13:48] and as it appointed to man wants to die
[13:50] but after this the Judgment so Christ
[13:51] was once offered to Bear the sins of
[13:53] many and unto them that look for him
[13:55] shall he appear the second time without
[13:57] sin unto salvation
[13:58] this is one of many examples but the
[14:00] disciples on the road to Emmaus they
[14:02] were actually you know disheartened or
[14:04] they were down downtrodden whatever you
[14:06] want to say they weren't talking about
[14:07] him maybe in good way they're kind of
[14:09] disappointed but yet they were talking
[14:10] about them and he came around but
[14:12] there's many other examples you can give
[14:14] in the scripture where the disciples or
[14:15] someone would be talking about him then
[14:17] here he'd come around so he comes to
[14:19] those who are looking for him that's my
[14:20] point if you're really looking for him
[14:22] and living a life that's consecrated to
[14:25] him and really closely looking for him
[14:26] in the Bible and the message in your own
[14:28] life you'll see him
[14:31] the statue perfect man
[14:34] if you take uh well if you take us
[14:36] that's nothing but a wild Gore and not
[14:38] head C I'll skip on down uh see because
[14:41] I got too many
[14:42] goals to get to here Christ's Faith was
[14:45] not based on those Pharisees Saturday
[14:46] season and their pots kettles or pans
[14:48] they're watching it's based on the word
[14:49] of God so much until Christ was the word
[14:52] the word was made flesh and then when we
[14:55] can get so transfused by his power that
[14:57] we die to our own thinking our faith
[15:00] becomes a genuine Faith Hallelujah then
[15:01] the Life of Christ is transfused into us
[15:04] we become living creatures of God a
[15:06] dwelling place where the Holy Spirit
[15:07] consented radiant blessings down through
[15:09] there and we're in the stature of Christ
[15:11] so that's how that happens we get in
[15:14] Christ
[15:15] and now we put on the uh put the blood
[15:17] of Jesus Christ and see that brings the
[15:19] faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of
[15:21] Jesus Christ the knowledge now he says
[15:23] blood here we're talking about blood the
[15:24] life is in the blood that's what brother
[15:26] Bob's been teaching on in Sunday school
[15:27] the life in the blood
[15:29] the knowledge Jesus Christ the Timbers
[15:30] of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus
[15:32] Christ the godliness of Jesus Christ the
[15:34] brotherly kindness Jesus Christ and the
[15:35] love of God which is Jesus Christ he is
[15:38] the head that controls you and your feet
[15:40] is the foundation he man control by the
[15:41] head
[15:42] that's the stature of as the perfect man
[15:45] of God when he possesses these virtues
[15:46] so let's go back to the life of Jesus
[15:48] when he was at 12. it's interesting the
[15:51] Bible would make a note to make it a
[15:53] point to mention that because you know
[15:55] the rest of that time of him growing up
[15:57] is what we call the silent years you
[15:58] don't see much of anything any account
[16:00] of him in the scripture but for some
[16:02] reason it mentions him at 12 and what's
[16:03] he doing he's all about the father's
[16:05] business
[16:06] he's in the temple with the uh you know
[16:10] the scribes the teachers basically just
[16:12] say discussing the word of God because
[16:14] he was all about the father's business
[16:15] even at that very young age it's what we
[16:17] call the age of accountability
[16:19] it may not be a defined age per se at
[16:21] exactly 12 it could be 10 11 12 13 some
[16:24] are long in there but when at this stage
[16:26] in life when a person recognizes they
[16:28] are a moral agent and have the ability
[16:30] to choose right and wrong okay no longer
[16:33] what Mom and Daddy tell you right and
[16:34] wrong about get your hand out of the
[16:35] cookie jar don't cross the road without
[16:37] us holding your hand or whatever this
[16:39] comes to a new level when when your
[16:41] conscience sort of awakens to the
[16:43] realization that you are a moral being
[16:45] and you can make right and wrong choices
[16:47] moral right and wrong choices and then
[16:50] that's the age where you can first
[16:52] really sincerely give your heart to the
[16:54] Lord because you begin to realize you're
[16:55] a sinner needs salvation what's our Lord
[16:57] doing he's so consecrated to God that
[17:00] he's discussing the word with these
[17:02] seasoned you know scribes and Pharisees
[17:05] and whatever all was there
[17:06] he's he's all about the father's
[17:08] business from a very young age and
[17:10] you'll see now how that spawns this
[17:12] growth for these silent years that you
[17:14] don't hear of him again from 12 to 29
[17:16] and a half you don't hear much of
[17:17] anything of him but those are growth
[17:19] happening in there
[17:20] okay
[17:21] there had to be because that's that's
[17:23] what he was living out he was portraying
[17:25] that part of a Christian Living their
[17:28] life and daily just doing his carpenter
[17:31] work and
[17:33] taking his lunch box under his arm to
[17:34] work and meditating on the scripture
[17:38] in Luke 252 and Jesus increased in
[17:41] wisdom and his stature in favor with God
[17:43] and man so here you see a picture of
[17:45] maybe what he might have looked like a
[17:46] little bit older still about the
[17:48] father's business
[17:49] it didn't just show up at the River
[17:51] Jordan just died one day on so I'll be
[17:52] baptized I think this would be a good
[17:53] place good time to be baptized I know
[17:55] there was a whole long time of a life
[17:57] consecrated Christ leading up or
[17:58] consecrated to the Lord leading up to
[18:00] that point okay it wasn't just overnight
[18:02] he just decided that one day
[18:05] so this is from uh brother Louise
[18:07] Wednesday night through our ups and
[18:09] downs God is molding these virtues in
[18:11] our hearts and lives through our mundane
[18:13] task of life it didn't take a shouting
[18:15] service to give you knowledge it didn't
[18:17] take a shouting service to give you
[18:18] patience it didn't take for a brother to
[18:20] lay hands on you amen give you godliness
[18:23] it's through the daily routine of coming
[18:25] to church going to work dealing with
[18:27] people talking with people doing my wife
[18:29] I hope he didn't get in trouble for
[18:31] saying that dealing with my daughters
[18:32] dealing with her children cleaning dirty
[18:34] diapers folding clothes amen doing all
[18:37] that and now you get all it and in this
[18:39] mundane in these mundane things so we
[18:42] need those mundane things we need our
[18:44] daily life
[18:45] it's a supernatural thing that's
[18:46] happening but it happens just on our
[18:48] day-to-day life as you do your chores
[18:50] around the house or go work with your
[18:53] lunchbox on your arm and make the best
[18:55] of them the joy of the Lord is in my
[18:57] strength and in the mundane routine
[18:59] things you know the things of this life
[19:00] it's all about mundane routines and
[19:02] repetitions
[19:03] nothing that's why the Bible says that
[19:05] he is the same yesterday the day and
[19:06] forever that's the foreman right there
[19:08] makes great things happen he never
[19:10] changes so we know always need to the
[19:13] dramatic
[19:14] we don't always need to see dramatic
[19:16] things and in our life get well
[19:19] acquainted with the mundane of your life
[19:20] and say Lord how can I reflect the
[19:22] kingdom of God in this that I'm doing
[19:24] because I just don't see it but help me
[19:26] to see it
[19:27] amen so here's Jesus a little bit older
[19:30] and what's he doing he's burning the
[19:33] midnight oil so to speak staying up
[19:35] reading the scripture in the Old
[19:36] Testament Scrolls and studying the word
[19:39] of God becoming acquainted with that
[19:41] Jesus increased in wisdom and stature
[19:43] and Faith we're gone so these Jesus I
[19:45] said here is in the silent years Daily
[19:47] Grind mundane life quietly growing in
[19:50] Grace and knowledge at some point he
[19:51] took on and worked with his um
[19:54] Earthly dad will say Joseph and did the
[19:56] carpenter work and so forth but he still
[19:59] kept growing in Grace and knowledge
[20:01] no doubt staying up late reading the
[20:03] Scrolls because he maybe had such a full
[20:05] day's work he couldn't get to it that
[20:07] day so he if you don't find time for God
[20:09] you have to make time for God okay
[20:11] that's a lesson I learned when I was 15
[20:13] years old and I said I can't find time
[20:15] when I make time to read my Bible every
[20:17] day I don't care what it takes
[20:19] then here's Jesus all of a sudden come
[20:21] to be baptized well as I said that was a
[20:23] long life
[20:24] of Consecration and
[20:26] leading up to that
[20:29] didn't just happen overnight
[20:32] Matthew 4 then was Jesus led up of the
[20:35] spirit of the Wilderness to be tempted
[20:36] of the devil now here's where you see
[20:38] some of this uh statue of man that's now
[20:40] come into him he's developed he's grown
[20:42] up into the stature and now it begins to
[20:44] be tested immediately after he's
[20:46] baptized he goes to the Wilderness to be
[20:47] tempted and tried or into the desert and
[20:50] when it fasted 40 days and 40 nights he
[20:52] was outward hunger and when the
[20:53] temperature came to him he said if thou
[20:54] be the Son of God command these stars
[20:56] but me they may be made bread
[20:58] by the answer instead of not is it not
[21:01] it is written man should not live I've
[21:02] read alone but by every word that
[21:03] proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[21:05] so he had knowledge to know what to do
[21:07] with the word of God he had Temperance
[21:08] self-control all of a sudden all these
[21:10] attributes started to come into display
[21:12] he had
[21:13] um or the virtues he had patience to
[21:16] wait on God
[21:17] his natural body was hungered all of a
[21:19] sudden but now he's he's already come to
[21:22] this stature of a perfect man and he can
[21:24] he can handle these trials and
[21:26] temptations Matthew 4 then the devil
[21:28] takes them up to the holy city instead
[21:30] of them on a pinnacle of the temple and
[21:31] saith in him if thou be the Son of God
[21:33] cast thyself down for his written he
[21:35] shall give his angels charge concerning
[21:36] thee in their hands they shall bear the
[21:38] opposite any time thou bash left foot
[21:39] against the stone Jesus said unto them
[21:40] it is written again Thou shalt not tempt
[21:43] the Lord thy God he knew what was to be
[21:45] done with the word he had knowledge to
[21:46] know how to handle the word and he knew
[21:48] that he's not the clown around for the
[21:50] devil not to make a not to be made a
[21:51] puppet or something
[21:53] again the devil take him up to a seating
[21:55] high mountain and show them all the
[21:56] kingdoms of the world and the glory of
[21:58] them and say to him all these things
[22:00] will I give thee if thou will fall down
[22:02] and worship me
[22:03] then saith Jesus unto him get the hint
[22:05] Satan for his written Thou shalt Worship
[22:07] the Lord thy God him only shall thou
[22:09] serve and the devil leaveth him and
[22:10] behold the angels can Minister unto him
[22:12] so again he knew what to do there he had
[22:15] all these virtues to know how to handle
[22:17] that situation in John 2 I'm just I'm
[22:19] not going to read the whole thing y'all
[22:20] know what's happening in the uh Temple
[22:23] he went to cast out the money changers
[22:24] turn over the money changers tables and
[22:26] cast them out because they made his
[22:27] father's house the house of merchandise
[22:29] but one scripture this one here is in
[22:31] John 2 points out that he planted a
[22:33] court of ropes you know he didn't just
[22:35] all of a sudden just lash out at him he
[22:37] had sat there and meditated this this
[22:39] was channeled and uh not something just
[22:43] sporadically he just lost his temper no
[22:45] it was very intentional and he was in
[22:48] full self-control of what was happening
[22:49] there
[22:50] then we find him many other examples
[22:52] between here and there but when we
[22:54] finally get to his Garden of Gethsemane
[22:56] experience as brother Aaron preached a
[22:59] while back he made his petition known he
[23:01] said Lord I would that this father what
[23:03] this cup passed for me that was his own
[23:05] desire he said I'm just asking you at
[23:07] this past me nevertheless not my will
[23:09] but thy will be done he surrendered his
[23:11] own will to the father and said I'll do
[23:14] whatever you say if this is your will so
[23:16] that showed self-control it showed
[23:18] patience and showed a submission and all
[23:21] those things to the to the father's will
[23:22] godliness
[23:25] and then first Peter 2.
[23:27] this is all talking about where he was
[23:30] being mocked and being basically
[23:33] tortured uh beat right before the um
[23:35] crucifixion and throughout all of this
[23:38] punishment that he bore for our sins
[23:41] at the very last months of his life he
[23:43] was asking them and they would come to
[23:44] the place which is called Calvary and
[23:45] there they crucified him the malfeiters
[23:47] on the one hand on the and then on the
[23:49] other on the left then Jesus said father
[23:51] forgive them for they know not what
[23:53] they're doing that is the very epitome
[23:54] the embodiment of all those
[23:57] things he talked about earlier on about
[23:59] us being perfect and coming to this full
[24:02] growth of stature perfect man he was all
[24:04] of that embodied there and on display
[24:06] because the people who are torturing him
[24:08] killing him mocking him and betraying
[24:11] him and all those things he prayed for
[24:12] them and loved them
[24:14] despite all that
[24:17] statue of perfect man we're not the
[24:19] building organization I might hear this
[24:21] morning to build an organization Christ
[24:22] never sent me to build an organization
[24:24] Christ sent me to build individuals to
[24:26] the stature of Jesus Christ that they
[24:29] might be the PowerHouse The Dwelling
[24:31] Place of the Spirit by his word
[24:33] so you build up the individual to that
[24:35] place now build an organization but
[24:37] build the individuals Sons and Daughters
[24:38] of God that's the idea uh you musician
[24:40] musicians can go ahead and come up
[24:42] and I think I'm gonna have to close
[24:44] right there
[24:46] let's see and now we've put the blood of
[24:49] Jesus Christ in and see that brings the
[24:50] faith of Jesus Christ I already read
[24:52] that I remember reading that sorry
[24:56] I'm going to skip down about halfway
[24:58] down this one he spoke through it isn't
[24:59] me it wasn't the seventh angel no it was
[25:02] the manifestation of the son of man it
[25:04] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[25:06] mystery that God unfolded it's not a man
[25:09] it's God the angel was not the son of
[25:12] man he was the messenger from the son of
[25:14] man the son of man is Christ he's the
[25:15] one that you're feeding on you're
[25:16] feeding you're not feeding on a man
[25:19] his words will fail but you're feeding
[25:21] on the unfailing body word of the son of
[25:23] man okay I'm gonna stop right there God
[25:25] bless you all
[25:27] [Applause]
[25:41] [Music]
[26:07] thank you
