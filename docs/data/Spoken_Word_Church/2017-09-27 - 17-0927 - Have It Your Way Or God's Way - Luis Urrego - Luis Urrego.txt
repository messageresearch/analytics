because that's what he's all you're doing good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you ready to hear the word we sing let's invite our brother to come on out and minister the word of the Lord

taking place and I don't like that we know it's a horrible day but it's here and we can't stop things from going but we can ask God to be with the people and comfort them co destiny is right open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart I want to see you I want to see here open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my I want to see I want to see to see you hi and lipid shiny pour out

to the house of God to get filled up Amen I believe God's house is God's filling station said that before you know you see the Cutie out in the road and you're running out of gas and when you see those signs those gas station signs you know you're safe when I see the house of the Lord opened up I know I'm safe Amen because I know the word of the Lord is there a man filled me up to give me the rest of the week amen praise God I don't know about you but I feel that way it's up to you between you and God if you don't feel that way amen praise the Lord let's let's just go to the let's go to the to the scriptures tonight and in Jonah chapter 4 Jonah chapter 4 and appreciate each and every one of you for praying for us to Sunday we were in South Carolina ministering for brother Burley Williams there and near my hometown well where I grew up part of my life there in Anderson so it was good to see all my family there and everything said and the Burley wasn't there he's he was in the UK but the Saints there they send greetings to you all brother Dale and everybody amen so we had a good time amen I believe the Lord Lord bless the people and it's kind of strange because I had to administer in English and Spanish you know they have people there that don't speak English and so when brother Bradley gave me a call he said brother Louise my interpreter is not gonna be there either he was in Oregon ministering as well so he said you think you could do it in English and Spanish and I've done that once before I believe I said well let's do it but the Lord helped me out and you know so you know transitioning between English and Spanish you know is you know interpreting is a little difficult but then when you're having to preach in both languages you know that's another thing but but we had church amen so appreciate the Lord for that amen praise God let's just turn let's just go to Jonah chapter 4 Jonah chapter 4 verse 1 it says but it displeased Jonah exceedingly and he was very angry and he prayed unto the Lord and said I pray thee O Lord was not this my saying when I was yet in my country therefore I fled before unto Tarsus for I knew that thou art a gracious God and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repentance thee of the evil aren't you thankful that he's that way amen that's why he's God and I'm not therefore now O Lord take I beseech thee my life from me for it is better for me to die than to live then said the Lord there was now well to be angry I wonder if that's a question that the Lord asks should ask us some of us so Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city and there made him a booth just go whine a little bit and said under in the shadow till he might see what he would would become of the city Amen let's just have a word of Prayer our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord further your blessings that you provide for us through your word now father God anoints lips that we just have just to say what you would want us to say Lord you know the needs of your people and father God just help us you speak to you the people father God open up our ears of our understanding that we were only here Oh father God what you would have to say unto us Lord and not what a man has to say father we pray we commit ourselves into you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen any man praise God you may be seated this evening praise the Lord I also wanted to read proverbs chapter 14 verse 12 says which says there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death amen praise God and I want to call this out title this message have it your way or God's Way man you know the step by the way do you know he's been preaching about the seals brother Dale's been bringing forth what he's been bringing and now we're gonna just kind of get a little bit down to our lives a little bit and if I say if I say something that might might step on your toes well maybe they needed to be step on you know because let me tell you we all have a little bit of Jonas in each and every one of us and if you say if you say that you don't or you've never experienced some of the things that Jonas has a Jonah here has experienced maybe you're lying because all of us have a little bit of Jonah some of us have a lot of Jonah and I'll be the first one to raise my hand I'm hard-headed stubborn but I pray God that God would just take that Oh and he's working on me just like the little song says he's still working on me I'm glad he is that means he's not done with me because he's still working amen praise the Lord so the you know and I want to just throw this in I wanted to throw this in that in second Timothy chapter 3 just for those who say well you know what he's not preaching deep you know he's not going deep but let me tell you about the grace of God the grace of God is very deep it's something that you and me don't understand and we can't experience the grace of God we don't know how to have the grace of God the way God has the grace the grace for people you and me it feels up to you and me I thought I'd kill people you know what I'd say Lord take him out take him out because that's not what out you know but God sees things a different way amen and second Timothy chapter 3 says all Scripture is given by inspiration of God it says all scripture and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works I believe we can add the Book of Jonah in there hey man praise the Lord how many love the Lord Amen so you know Burger King they had they had a saying for a long time they said have it your way when they were sell their food how many remember that have it your way and they were trying to let the people know that you know you want it you're gonna get it the way you want it in reality you know there was already a cookie cutter method for them to serve your food but they were trying to bring that to the people you know to have it your way and but you know I don't know about you and the spiritual there is your way and I don't want that you know your own way will lead you to destruction I would rather eat God's hamburger than my own hamburger amen God's hamburger taste better it doesn't have any fillers and doesn't have any antibiotics and all these kinds of things amen and you know there is a consequence you know if you're constantly eating at Burger King right you're gonna see it are you gonna see it show up amen the view that that's what you constantly eat and so there is going to be a consequences for you to have your way I'd rather have God's Way amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so tonight I want to gear this message you know it's for all of us but I want to also gear it to the toward the young people as well amen so I believe each and ever one of us are young we're heading to youth and those who may feel little wearying that you're you're becoming younger amen praise God amen so we know just a little bit of background we know Jonah he was a true prophet of God he meant and you know people criticized and I know we have a little Jonah's here tonight and brother Joe little boy but when I'm a brunette when I'm talking about Jonah well I'm not referring to him I'm talking about this Jonah amen amen so so Rachel and and brother Joe you you you know that amen praise God but in the Bible we don't know too much about Jonah other that he lived in the days of one of Israel's Kings which was Jeroboam ii there's another scripture in the Bible where it talks about Jonah and that's in 2nd Kings chapter 14 verse 25 which says worse 23 I'll start here at verse 25 he restored the coast of Israel from the entering of hema 'the unto the sea of the plain talking about King Jeroboam the second according to the word of the Lord God Israel which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah the son of Amitai the prophet which was of gaffer so we see here that Jonah was who we seen here that he was the son of Amitai and he was also from gaffer and gaffer is a area in Israel just right above just right above Jerusalem around the place where Jesus was actually born near Nazareth and so and so during this time that Jonah during this reign of Jeroboam ii there was a lot of political and economic prosperity in the kingdom but there was not any spiritual prosperity and if there was very little king jeroboam reign for about forty one years according to what the Bible says and so Jonah he prophesied that King Jeroboam he was going to have this prosperity that was going to come to Israel at that time so we know that he was a God sent God called man right I don't think any one of us could argue with that Amen praise God and so we see here in in Jonah chapter one in Jonah chapter one if you want to if the brothers would just want to bring it up on the screen and we'll just kind of we just want to kind of go through through the Book of Jonah here is four chapters amen but they're very powerful chapters the story of Jonah is very interesting amen and so you know the Lord was just been been dealing with me about this and and so I hope something you receive a blessing from it Amen praise God it says it says in Jonah chapter 1 it says in verse 1 now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of amat I see we see there again who he referencing that he was the son of Amitai saying arise go to Nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me amen so we see here that God is telling Jonah to arise because there is a city that needs his that needs his his ministry man and we know God God could do things himself but I mean we know he uses man he used he used the man in this hour right he used as a fivefold ministry in this hour to speak to us amen to help us amen and so we had and we know that God knows the beginning from the end so before even he called he knew what was going to happen he knew what was going to be Jonas's response and so he he tells him go and cry against this city for this city is uh is wicked and the stench of the city has come up before me now I wanna I wanna I want to read just just a little bit of just a little bit of history about about the the city about the city Nineveh so the Nineveh was a very prosperous city and it was very elaborate it was very elaborately well built populated by different kinds of peoples from the from around the Middle East so it was somewhat like the city of Los Angeles which was a group a group of cities that they made the the city of Los Angeles right it was a pagan city Ishtar was the goddess of fertility and war and that was the goddess that they worshiped and they also had another goddess by the name of ninja and ninja was was the female version or the female counterpart of Dagon which was the fish God and brother branham he talks about the this that this city they worshipped the fish God and it was very possible that when Jonah rose and landed on the shore that they saw that he came out of mouth of the fish and therefore that's the reason why they served you know they repented and they heard and heard his message but now look at what the Israelite people in Jonah one of the reasons why he didn't want to go this is this is what it's talking about Nineveh just looking at some history says when God said that Nineveh was wicked he was not kidding not only were they extremely immoral but the Assyrians had a reputation for cruelty that is hard for us to fathom their specialty was brutality of a gross and disgusting kind when their armies captured a city or a country unspeakable atrocities were occur things like skinning people alive decapitation mutilation ripping out the tongues making a pyramid of human heads this is when they would go and conquer a city or a nation this is what they would take all the males and decapitate them and make pyramids out of out of the the male's heads piercing the chin with a rope and forcing prisoners to live in kennels like dogs ancient records from Assyria boast of this kind of cruelty as a badge of courage and power so the Assyria and the record assyrian records where the Nineveh is currently located word or it was located it's right it's located where Mosul Iraq is currently right now and it's just later ruins right now but this is what they record and they were proud and they boast of these things so you see no wonder that Israelite people hated hated the Assyrians hated the people of Nineveh and and why would Jonah's not a same thing he hated these people he hated he would be more than glad to have seen them being destroyed just like you know today you know a lot of a lot of Christians and a lot of people and I believe in some form of programming but they have this thing against the the the that the Muslims are gonna come and get us and all these kinds of things and and you know what and they have this this hate towards the Muslim people but you know what God loves the Muslim people just as much as he loves you I believe I believe that God can save the Muslim people amen I believe that God there's a sister there's a sister up in Canada that she was a Muslim and she goes to a messege church up there in Canada and she got saved so God can save Muslims amen so they're not they're not they're not all evil amen praise God we got God where God has a heart for the people that we Don that's why we don't understand what grace is all about it men and you know it's a very common word that's be that we use the grace of God in that it's using Christianity when you say the grace of God the grace grace but it's sometimes hard for us to to fathom you know if somebody's trying to give us something somebody calls you up and says well you're going to do the book you want a Bahamas trip for five days and five nights - you know - the Bahamas on a cruise well the first thing that comes to your mind is uh well what's the catch because I mean there's nothing free in life there's nothing free in life you know what's the catch and you're wondering what I'm gonna have to pay something in just a moment something's gonna my brother's good bank account is going to be something's gonna come out of my bank account because there's you know we're being programmed nothing's free in life but God a man all the way for instance since uh since even before a since Abraham he was showing us what hid what His grace was all about in Exodus chapter 34 he says when and when speaking to Moses he says and the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed we speak when he was speaking to Moses and proclaimed this is what the Lord proclaimed he said the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious long-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth they meant keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children I'm glad that he mentioned grace and mercy before he mentioned that he was going to visit the iniquity of that you know that's why he's all about he would rather give grace and give mercy and forgive before he would gen send judgment that's our God amen praise the Lord I'm thankful for that in this hour because like I said I certainly needed that grace I certainly needed that mercy amen and so grace is very shocking to us as humans something we don't understand the grace of God that's why I said I'm careful that he's God and I'm not because that's the first thing I would do you know I the homosexual out here what we want to do condemnation God said in his word God can say the homosexual - amen the prostitute out here the drunkard the no matter who it is amen you know what and you and me could have been that way if it wasn't for the grace of God amen and we know that the the capstone amen the headstone is crying grace grace grace amen I'm thankful because if that grace which is Jesus Christ amen if that grace is abiding in you and me then that's what we need to be shown to people as well grace grace and this our mercy before judgment but we're so quick to to judge when somebody does us wrong or where we hear that somebody's saying something about us or something's talking about us you don't even get the whole story you just heard it from that person and you're quick to judge amen but so that's the that's that's what grace we don't understand what grace is all about amen so Jonah here in in in in Chapter 1 he receives a phone call from God and says go to Nineveh because there's a people that you need to preach to over there amen and and and sometimes in that type of phone call then you know sometimes we may get a phone call that way and it changes your life completely and maybe on that line they may maybe somebody the same well you have a great aunt or something like that and you're inherited hundreds of thousands of dollars well that'd be great news but then they're on the other line they could be somebody who's saying you know somebody that close just passed away and it just changed your life forever right and this is the kind of message that that Jonah received something that had changed his life forever because I'm sure he wasn't the same from then on amen so we see here in Jonah and Jonah and Minh that's the thing that God he loves to pull us out of our comfort zones you know I mean what is your Nineveh you each and every one of us have an innovating our lives sometimes we just get so comfortable and lacks Oh every Sunday we're gonna go to church and we know that there's gonna be 45 minutes of song of 30 minutes of song leading and brother Dale is gonna come out and preach and then we go home and you know we just kind of get in the routine and and but maybe our Nineveh is that next-door neighbor next to your house that you that just gets on your nerves because you don't cut the grass maybe that's your Nineveh maybe maybe the your Nineveh is uh you know something something for the young people you know in Nineveh I can't I can't I can't get on the phone like the cellphone the way out the way I want to you know chat on Facebook I come why can't I have a Facebook account the way you know just all open access you know and everything you know but you see God knows exactly what he needs to do in order to to make us to kind of rubber our fur a little bit a man and this is what he did to Jonah a man so we read we continue to read here in Jonah chapter 1 is in verse 2 it says arise go to Nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me but Jonah rose up and you would think here in the next verse that they would say now Jonah rose up and he went to Nineveh but that's but that's not what it says right that's but Jonah rose up to flee on to Tarshish you see that was his intention to flee on to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord and went down to Joppa and he found this ship going to Tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it now I want you to see how the Lord is saying down down and we see that later on he goes down down further down you know and that's the spirit that's our spiritual life sometimes because when you're not when you're going down you're certainly not going up later on we're gonna see that he's down in the cabin then he goes down into the sea and then finally he's down into a whale's belly or if big fish belly and his that's the climax of his spiritual life but but God you know God has certain say he has all intentions to go to Tarshish all intentions to go to Tarsus and he goes and he buys a ticket and I'm sure when he boards the boat you know he I'm sure he he's packing his bags and everything the night before he says I'm leaving I'm sorry Lord I'm not going over there to speak to Nineveh that's just not me he goes packs his bags leaves play pays for his ticket and he goes down into a cabin and he probably takes off his sandals and in the sits on the bed and just just to relax wow this is nice you know probably has a nice little cabin window right there next to him where he can look at the ocean view and and and so he's just relaxed you know and the Bible says in verse 4 said but the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken so God we see that God is the one that's doing all this amen and when Jonah thought that he was able to escape from the presence of God or try to get away when he bought that ticket to Tarshish you know when Satan when when you want to flee from the presence of the Lord in your spiritual life when you're trying to get away from the God and you're trying to do you know Satan and he'll provide a boat for you he'll provide a way for you to get you know I got many boats to choose from you want to go you want to go here you want to go here you want to go here there's plenty to choose and he'll provide the transportation for you and so he found a ship to go to Tarshish and but you know what when we think that we're doing the our own thing and we think we're getting away from the Lord and the Lord Huff's he just allows us to just do just go ahead go go on go on that doesn't mean you're right doesn't mean you're right but he lets us because he snows that he has a lesson to show here and that's why he's gonna show here and just say he has a lesson for Jonah amen and verse four says but the Lord sent out or we would just read that verse 5 then the Mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his God and cast forth the where's that's the cargo that were in the ship into the seat lightened to lighten the boat so we see here that God sends this this this storm and it was so strong that they had to cast out the the cargo from the boat amen and it was it was and God had it was just looking at Jonah's the whole time and the only reason why this was happening to the ship was because Jonas was on the boat and and the people were being affected by what was going on they didn't they didn't they didn't do anything it wasn't their fault that the ship was in chaos and they were in the middle of the storm it was all Jonah showing us that that you you know you don't sin alone when you sin and you're doing things behind behind people's back you're you're not just gonna affect yourself you're gonna affect your wife you're gonna affect your children you're gonna affect the church you're gonna affect the pastor you're gonna affect everybody around you so you think you're doing something sneaky and you're trying to get away with with with something and nobody's seeing you for first of all God sees you that's more than enough for two to bring the fear upon you right but eventually you're gonna affect the people that you love around you amen I've been there done that and you affect the ones that love the ones that you love around you and and this is what happened to Jonas so he the people that there wasn't it wasn't they're there they're there their fault so verse 6 it says here - so - it Master came to him and said unto him and I can imagine the ship master that the ship was in the middle of this chaos and this ship master he's he's going around and around the cabins knocking to make sure is everybody okay is everything going okay and he goes over to Jonases uh cabin and he finds him sleeping because he's over there knocking and nobody is opening the door he knocks again excuse me sir nobody's opening the door finally he just kind of latches the door open and he sees this man sleeping and in the middle of this storm and you know what Satan Satan when you're out doing wrong and stuff like that he's got sleeping pills for you he's got pills where you you you have nothing you know nobody knows anything and and so everything's okay you know everything's quite all right and I'm here in my I'm doing it by myself and everything's quite all right and and you know and you're blind to what's going on this is exactly what's happening to Jonas in the middle of the storm such storm that they had to throw out their cargo mariners are panicking all over the place and Jonah's downstairs sleeping yeah my yeah I'm wondering if some of us are not sleeping in this hour you know the Bible says that there's going to there's a sleeping virgin in the light and then in the in this Howard there's a sleeping virgin and that's not just the denomination that could be those who say they believe in a prophet Oh III believe the profit I've came into the message you know fifty years ago and I know I'm saved and filled with the Holy Ghost but when the word goes forth in this hour when don't when when the word is is being laid out you know in in brother Wade's been bringing out some of the good things on the seals and stuff like that and you cringe about that are you receiving the word for your day amen because I mean we're beyond God sent a prophet I mean we should be amen I believe God sent a prophet I believe I believe that he sent but I want to know what he said that's what I want amen I want to know what he said praise God so the shipmaster came to him and said unto him what meanest thou o sleeper arise Colin died Gardens it's a sieve maybe if think upon us that we perished not and they said every one to his fellow come and let us cast lots that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us so they cast lots lady in there knitting that they didn't know what else to do the destroyit started gambling in the middle of this storm started gambling that you know I don't have they had dice or what but they cast lots somebody's causing this and it might be that sleeper down there and so they cast the Lots and the Lots we know and just trying to avoid a little bit of reading so like the time but and the Lots fall on Jonah and don't you think that God wasn't in control of those Lots now I'm gonna show you a scripture here in the Bible the Bible says in proverbs chapter 16 verse 33 it says the law is cast into the lap but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord so people can you know people through these Lots in the ship but it laying it and it landed on Jonah Atlanta for Jonah and God was in full control of all that just as he was in full control of the storm coming in and I believe he even allowed for him to even board the ship as well he said okay Jonah is that what that's what you want let me go ahead and uh here you go here you go and Jonah thinking the whole time he's getting away from the presence of God I wonder if that's how some of us don't think you know oh I'm just getting away with it I'm having my own way but Nederland knowing that God he is perfect his his permissive will will always turn into his perfect way amen praise God amen and you know Jonah probably thinking in his mind before he boarded the ship he's probably thinking oh my well because you know how sometimes we rationalize things in our head and we spiritualize things and say Lord will Lord maybe I mean I know in Tarsus they need the Lord just as much as an in event so I'm gonna go to Tarshish you know and I prayed about it you know and you know everything's everything's everything's all right and you know what Lord I'm confident because I went down to Joppa and I had the money to pay for the fare III was there was a ship it's straight for Tosha so this has to be the will of God yeah and he's probably there just you know Lane when he was laying down and fell honestly just thinking about that just reason and don't we do that sometimes the reason in our heads you know about whether we should do something or not and brother brother Graham said if there's a question about it don't do it at all you know there's a question about it right praise God so the lot falls on Jonah and so we continue reading here in verse nine or verse eight then said they unto him tell us we pray thee for whose cause this evil is upon us what is done occupation or no what is your job and whence where when do you where do you come from whence cometh thou what is that country and of what people art thou and he said unto them Jonas is that I am a Hebrew and I fear the Lord the God of heaven which hath made the sea and the dry land isn't it a shame that that's that that we have to confess you know the weird out doing the worldly things and when we're out in the world you know and eventually when that's not really in us to do but we're just following the crowd eventually we're gonna have to really confess who we really are it's gonna show forth a man I know what I know when I was uh when I was a out in the world doing the things of the world I know how it was raised I was raised right I was raised to serve God and I accepted the Lord Jesus as a savior when I was 12 years old and I was out daily downlink of the world and with my friends and they're out smoking cigarettes and I'm sitting there trying to smoke cigarettes and couldn't do it just couldn't do it I never did inhale [Laughter] you know I just I never learned how and you've heard that before top ranking official but and you know it was something like okay yeah I wanted to fit in but at the same time I couldn't fit in and they would ask me what's wrong it's wrong well you know I just can't do that I'll get you venture I would have to let them know you know that's just not I can't do that you know and when you're when God is dealing with you a man young people listen when God is really truly dealing with you you can't do the things of the world and he'll it and live happy and the things of the world you can't be happy with with uh you know just just doing any old thing and getting by with it and thinking you know when God is really working in your life if God is really working and doing their work in your life right amen things are gonna change in your life they're not gonna be the same they're not gonna be the same praise God so first believe burst and then we're the man exceedingly afraid after Jonas told him this and why has thou done this for the men knew that the fled from the presence of the Lord because he had told him so the people were afraid on the ship because they knew about Israel I'm sure they knew about Israel and I'm sure they knew about the guy how God is with was with Israel and when they told him I served a lot of the Lord of the Hebrews they were exceedingly afraid the Bible says then said they unto him what shall we do unto thee that the sea may be common to us for the Syrah and was tempestuous and he said unto them take me up and cast me forth into the sea so shall the sea be come unto you for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you to see Jonas knew the whole time he knows nevertheless I want you to see verse 13 nevertheless the man rode hard to bring it to the land but they could not for the sea rock and most impetuous against them these men had more grace than Jonah did they were trying to save Jonah they were trying to save Jonah before they would cast him into the sea so they had me had more they had more grace for Jonah than Jonah had for them and so in verse 14 wherefore they cried unto the Lord and said we beseech thee after they found out that they could not get to the land we beseech thee O Lord we beseech thee let us not perish for this man's life and so now these people are crying out to the Yahweh the Lord God the same God that Jonah the same God of the Hebrews they're crying out to the same Lord when in previous verses they were crying out to their gods but they decided their gods wasn't listening it's another cry out to the Lord and so Jonah all this has taken place Jonah's back slid but yet God is changing the situation to where people are knowing the true and living God and yet God is and yet Jonah's back slid but people are being saved in other words think about that your situation in your life no matter how negative it may seem it could be used for the positive right God has all of these things in control amen he knows every single detail and whether we understand it or not God has every detail in controlling man and so we see here that they took up Jonah and they cast him forth into the sea and the sea ceased from from her region so the storm stopped then demand then the man feared the Lord exceedingly and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord and made vows so without Jonah trying he made these man he made these man got saved and made the missionaries to Tarsus because I'm sure that boat was continuing to Tarsus out of all this chaos and Jonah's in the sea back slid in and and feeling all this guilt and all these things but yet God is working everything out where these men they recognize who the true Living God is because I'm gonna tell you these men when they get to Tarshish or wherever they get to they're gonna testify about what happened I mean I would I mean I just got saved from from a sinking storm in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea I was I'd be worshiping the Lord - and offering sacrifices my praise God and so continuing here in chapter 2 and says then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fishes actually verse 17 back on chapter 1 now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah and we know that there's a there's a thing you know people would say well it was a whale where it was it was a fish - what it doesn't matter it just says that the Bible said that God prepared this fish that's how we worried about and God prepared this fish and he told the fish you know what fish you're going to you're gonna gave him like GPS coordinates you know and told him he said you're gonna come over here to this specific spot and in this part there's gonna be a man that's gonna fall down and as he's falling down you're gonna open up your mouth and you're gonna swallow him up don't don't chew on him just swallow him up and that's exactly what the fish did fish obeyed God more than Jonas did and you know one time uh what was it the the Prophet who with the donkey you know that donkey speak through the donkey they obeyed the God more than the Prophet did now as we're looking through this Jonah's life you just think about the things as gone in your life amen or maybe things that are going on right now you know what's happening in your life is their stubbornness of your life because let me tell you God is not gonna lose not one of his children and God is gonna fulfill his word no matter what and you can go through your stubborn situations in your life you can go through I'm not gonna do that I'm not gonna obey the Lord in this even though the Bible says so but God's gonna make sure that his word is going to be fulfilled by you and he's gonna be obeyed by you whether you like it or not but I know eventually it will you will end up liking it because I'd rather have his his grace amen then his judgment Amen because we see here that Jonas in Chapter two we're not gonna read the whole prayer but but in Jonas chapter two he prays to the Lord and he's confessing to the Lord and he's and he's saying he's saying and said I cried unto I cried unto the Lord I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I on to the her and thou heard it's my voice amen and we know brother Bama said that he was in a Jonah was in a in the belly of the well of the fish and when he looked at his left there was fish guts and when he looked at his right there was fish guts when he looked forward there was fish guts behind him fish guts everywhere was fish guts and I'm sure it was darkened and nasty in there and stunk what else are you supposed to do there was no place station to play in there certainly and he couldn't get on his cell phone there was no signal what else is there to do but pray me and you can read his prayer in your own time amen but just the kind of highlight he says here in verse five the waters he's verse four says then I said I am cast out of thy sight yea I will look again toward thy holy temple Amen and when we're in trouble on this our Saints you know the Holy Temple was Jerusalem at that time you know was the temple there in Jerusalem but what is our temple in this hour is Christ amen hey and and when we look to him amen no matter what we're going through Saints no matter how how the situation how bad the situation is just look to the Word of God we cannot wait that's the only place where we can get help from amen you know you can go to the psychologist you can go to the brother you can go to the sister but there's suddenly a limit that they can do amen but when I turn to Christ amen he's limitless amen there's no limit to him and there and there's always a solution provided by him amen it may not be right away sometimes may not be right away but God has a solution for each one of our problems amen verse 5 the waters can pass me about even to the soul you know say young people you know sometimes we let the waters are though of this life of this world compass' us even it affects our soul you know too much video gaming too much Facebook too much too much Instagram too much Twitter too much all of this you know all this eventually can affect your soul right now saying those things are bad within themselves they have their place but what are you feeding on where you spend in town more is it the real Facebook God's Word face that book amen or is it Facebook amen because I'm telling you you know a lot of people find themselves marriages have been destroyed because of this relationships have been destroyed because of this Amen but there is a there's a there's a there is a way that these things can be used for good amen but anything that you spend more time on than God amen is a god to me amen it can be hunting it can be Facebook and can be basketball it can be whatever it is you more time more than God it's it's your God amen the weeds were wrapped around Bob my head you know and you may be going through trials and situations and demons may be talking to you God doesn't love you you've extinct you extent you you you you there's no more grace for you in this hour a man if you're still a lot there's still grace for you you know just have to run to it amen praise God verse 9 but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving a man I like that because Jonas is say even in the midst of his trouble he's thanking God and that's the best thing for us to do amen is thank the Lord when we're going through these trials and tribulations amen we don't know what to do just thank God amen I took one there was a brother in North Carolina one time that told me a young older brother and and I was young I'm younger the way younger than him and he was asked he was telling me he was like he's like my brother Lewis you know I get to a point now where I can't pray I don't know what to say when I pray like what he's like yeah I don't know what to say I said wood don't have to say anything just start thanking God just start worshiping God start praising God and then when you get into that atmosphere or that mode of worship eventually things will start flowing amen I mean that's what happens with me things with God this the Holy Spirit will speak and start speaking through you he meant praise the Lord amen and I will pay that that I have bowed salvation is of the Lord so out of out of Jonas's stubbornness this is what he comes to he comes to realize that it's not about me and it's not about it's not about me it's not what I desire is not what I want it's about him amen and he's gonna have his because the Bible says in first Corinthians 7 23 you are bought with a price and you're not your own amen but you are bought with a price your life belongs to God praise the Lord so when you're out dilly-dallying with the things of the world and the things that they are not helping you spiritually you're doing your own thing you're forgetting that you are bought with a price spiritual adultery on God amen in the Lord watch verse 10 and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land so there is a way out of the problems you know I always say problems have a beginning and they have an end problems are not eternal no matter what it is because they have a beginning and they have an end and so when God sees you that your attitude is right your heart is right Jonah's heart we see here that is right now right he's he's he's right and asked the Lord to forgive him and all these things and when God sees that you are in that's in that in that you might be coming out of your trial little by little or sometimes you can just come out right away Jonas came out right away vomited just like that out of the fish and what would you say when you were letting when you land on the shore I mean what would you do if you if you've landed on the shore and you got fish guts all around you you smell like fish you may look like a fish I don't know what are you supposed to do amen so chapter 3 Jonah the Bible says 2 - Jonah says and the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time and I like that baby because we know that God is a God of second chances amen and I'd just second chances but third chances fourth chances fifth chances you know Peter asked that's Jesus he says Lord how many times am I gonna forgive my brother is it seventy times and he said no i say unto you seventy times seven oh you mean four hundred it was at four hundred forty nine times okay four hundred and forty-nine times then so when I get to four hundred forty eight and brother Dale transcript brother Dale 448 you better be careful four hundred forty nine is coming you better not do it is that what the Lord met the Lord unlimited now not amount of times he maybe I'm in wouldn't you want to be forgiven I'm limited amount of times I mean you know God does have punishment I mean the Bible says that those that are his he's not going to let him get away if they're his you know if you're my child you know when I'm in Walmart or wherever I ain't punish somebody else's child when they're out in the floor crying and and and screaming and and and hitting their parents I I can't I can't punish them because they're why they're not my children but if my child was doing that I could punish them for that right because they're my child and if you're not feeling just like Jonah you know he was thinking he was getting away with all of this mmm sometimes the Lord just let you go for a little while so that you can suffer the consequences of it later amen verse 2 is in in verse 2 and chapter 3 says arise going to Nineveh that great city and preach it didn't preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee I will see a little bit more sternness in the Lord's voice here now preach what I print out what I bid thee to preach so Jonah arose and went on to Nineveh according to the word of the Lord now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journey now I want the brothers to see if they could pull up this the the graphic that I sent to them they don't mind and while they're doing that if they could pull the the the other one they have the other one now here's gaffer right here this is where Jonah was or was where he's from Joppa is right here this is the mission Nineveh it's about 500 miles from there but he decides he wants to go to Tarshish all the way up into Spain that's where Tarsus is it's about 2,500 miles and that's what we do sometimes we'd rather take the long road then take this the short road they meant to do good to do to do what God tells us to do oh I'd know I'd rather do it this way you know because I think it's just better Oh fine go ahead the Lord says but right here somewhere in here that's where that's where he gets caught up in the storm now so there's Nineveh right there and you remember how we were talking about how corrupt Nineveh was and uh and so this thing that even though Jonah had repented and he had he had gone through this situation that he's gone through even though he had repented he still had this this fright for to go to go to us you know and he had this thing because later on we'll see we'll see why and Jonah began in verse 4 in chapter 3 verse 4 and Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey and he cried and said yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown and that's all he told them that's all the message that he had for them was 40 repent because in 40 days your cities gonna be overthrown didn't say anything else to them 40 days you better repent or else the city will be overthrown and he steps out from the city after preaching he steps out from the city and we'll just read that in chapter four he steps out and sits not in the east part of the city and sits down to wait to see him so the Lord can destroy the city and isn't that how sometimes we wait you know for the people you know when they do wrong but well can't wait to see that destruction from the Lord okay wait for God to punish them oh my I'm gonna sit here with my crunch bar in my popcorn and I'm gonna have me a good time that's what later on Jonah does he's waiting for the destruction of the city to take place and the Bible says that the city they hear they don't hear Jonah but they hear Jonah but they hear they hear what they hear what God had to say through Jonah and they immediately from the king to the rest of the people they put on sackcloth they start repenting they start they start saying the the stop stop feeding the cows and stop feeding the chickens stop feeding your dogs put on sackcloth not just for the human people but also for the even the animals were to put on sackcloth the bankers stopped banking the teachers stopped teaching everybody stopped because we wanted to see if this if we can appease the the grace of God amen we can appease the Lord and the Bible says that they repent and in chapter four chapter 4 says but it displeased Jonah exceedingly and he was very angry and he prayed unto the Lord and said I pray thee O Lord was nothing was not this my saying when I was yet in my country therefore I fled before unto Tarsus so he's given us the reason why he fled on to Tarshish because I knew that thou art a gracious God and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness amen thank God and the people of Nineveh this is what they experienced so in verse 3 he says therefore now O Lord take I beseech thee my life from me for it is better for me to die than to live now John is acting like a little baby you know you know when you have when you have your your your child and he's screaming and hollering and saying I want it I want it and you know you can't have it but why you know and that's what Jonas is doing screaming and crying like a little child and this is a god called man the prophet of the Lord and I wonder sometimes you know we're caught God called people amen but that we love the people out here Amanda the same way we love the people in church you know just as I said earlier you know the prostitute out here the drunkard they need God just as much as we as you and me did I said well we blast those denominations and we say we you know and forgetting that you came out of one yourself at least I mean I did some of us may have come out from straight from the street you know but God saved each and every one of us Amen sinners saved by grace amen praise God then said the Lord do us that well to be angry in other words are is it okay for you to be angry so Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city and there made him a booth and senator said under it in the shadow till he might see what would become of the city he was so sure that God was just gonna destroy this city just I'm just positive I mean he's set there probably he got front-row seats you know just to watch the whole show not knowing that inside the city the people were doing what he had where he was requesting what he had and so Jonah I can imagine I'm just thinking you know John is probably mad because he has to go back to Israel and probably tell the people in Israel they never repented and people Israel hated the Ninevites what if what would that make him look like you know his pride you know sometimes our pride you know gets but gets the best of us amen and the Lord God prepared a gourd and made it to come up over Jonah that it might be a shadow over his head to deliver him from his grief I'm just thinking you know the Lord probably prepared this gourd this tree or this load there's something to kind of calm him down a little bit give him some shade you know take away this is this anger this thing they that he's gonna but he's got a lesson for him as well amen so Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd oh we're so happy when the blessings of the Lord come oh my you know and and everything's going alright you know the world is dying but you know we're blessed you know oh my we're not you know I have food in my house I have I have money in the bank I have everything's going fine but the world can can go to hell but I'm blessed I have food and everything's okay you know and we're supposed to be gracious people we're supposed to be people full of grace amen Saints but God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day and it smoked the gourd that it withered and it came to pass when the Sun did arise that God prepared a vehement east wind so here's God preparing all this the whole time and the Sun beat upon the head of Jonah that he fainted and wished in himself to die and said it is better for me to die than to live my goodness I mean what would you think of this man yeah if you were dealing with him you're a god dealing with this man what would you do for the weights but yet God still shows his mercy and grace to give us this I mean if I'm not mistaken I mean I believe was Joe names that wrote this I'm not sure exactly I would have been Jonah I believe he learned a lesson for him to write amen and God said to Jonah doest thou well to be angry for the gourd and he said I do well to be angry even unto death that's the reply that he gives to God yeah I am angry so take it take it or leave it you know kind of like cane the way he responded to God take it or leave it Lord then said the Lord thou has had pity on on the gourd for the which thou has not laboured neither made us to grow which came up in the night in Paris tonight so God telling Jonah look I could do whatever I want I do whatever I want to I could take you out if I wanted to and you're here whining like a baby and and and and saying why is it that I forgave the people is didn't you do what I asked you to do and I told and and and they did what I wanted them to do so therefore what else could I do it's trying to tell Jonah they repented verse 11 is should not our spared and innovate that great city wherein are more than six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and also much cattle so God can do whatever he wants to Saints amen so that's what he's trying to show Jonah and you know what Saints just wondering you know if if we don't have that type of attitude Amen sometimes right you know and God is trying to god is trying to let us know like well such as such you know such and such sister or such and such brother you know they might come into church and and they may be here for a while and there's something that you may be doing right but they might not be doing right and but but men of the Lord is dealing with people amen can't you just show grace to them let the Holy Spirit work in their lives amen let the Lord do the work in in people's lives amen because when the Lord does those types of work when the Lord does the work the Lord the work will be done right but when you try to do the work it's gonna it's gonna fall to pieces when Jonah tried to do his own thing amen it all fell to pieces the boat almost sank people around him almost died a storm came he ended up in the whales belly when you try to do your own thing when you try to bring your own word forth amen be careful not you may not do more harm than than you think you're doing good amen sometimes you know as the prodigal son the prodigal son when we read the Bible about the prodigal son the father he'd just let him go he said look okay here's the inheritance just go he never stopped him once but he was the Bible says that he was looking for him everything every day it was there at the door at the door waiting for him people probably tell me you know what your son's not coming back what are you talking you might say that but I know he is he's my child I know him I know her amen it's been 40 days he's coming he's coming she's coming your child amen your child may may may may be out in the world and been out in the world 10 15 20 30 40 50 years what doesn't matter I prayed for him I've prayed for her I'm claiming them amen I'm claiming her amen God's gonna bring him amen and it won't be me but I'll be right here waiting I'll be right here waiting for him amen and that's what the that's what the father did and eventually the the just like Jonah the the prodigal son he got into mischievious things you know went out and spent his money and bought expensive probably bought all kinds of expensive basketball shoes and bought all kinds of all kinds of things and he said to the people one time in the bar and all his friends he's like look all the beer for its it's all on me he thought that he had unlimited amount on his card one day he goes to charge it out in a nightclub and you come come back and come back denied look at your card is being denied what I know I got I have more than that it's key charges it again comes back tonight look you're gonna have to pay or some way somehow for these things you know that you you you got your own DJ in here and you got your own you're gonna have to pay up well that's that's the only card I have well I'm sorry then go work then you go labor with pigs then that's the way you're gonna have to pay us then so that's where he ended up but he learned his lesson the Bible says that he came to himself and when he came to himself amen the the father wasn't on the cell phone calling him you know talking to him you know and and all that late son when are you gonna come to church son when are you gonna do this some are you gonna do that the father was just praying for him and eventually the father a man the Bible says he came to himself and he came up walking up to the road and he said look the servants have but there lived better than I do walking up the road and the father there waiting for him and he and before he even came before he even got to the father the father had already his arms around him hugging him and telling him in telling him son you've come back I knew you would I knew you would and the he the son get ready to to tell him Father forgive me and the father says don't worry about that he looks back and he says calls out to his servants bring me the robe bring me a ring bring me shoes bring me this because my father was my son was lost but now he's found was blind but now you can see Amen that's the grace of God Saints so how many of us have experienced the grace of God in our in our lives they men how many are still experiencing the grace of God amen as I said I certainly needed a man I need the grace of the Lord amen you know I told you all our this year something happened to me that that out in the sea you know that uh I just bought lost my life if it wasn't for the grace of God middle of the there you know knocking the just trying to have a good time but being stubborn my wife telling me you be careful be careful those waves are kind of hot they feel good they're slapping on my back and it feels great you know and then see you know and then that undercurrent you know it just takes you and then there's nothing you can do you feel vulnerable you can imagine how Jonah feel felt I mean the reason why you know that the fish is but the the well the fish's belly where he was then that was that was his his his rescue right there you know he was safer in there and then he was out you know and and some song while I was out there and current pulling me and I'm sitting there screaming for help and nobody can hear me nobody can hear me because it was hardly anybody there on the shore and my wife she's fur but she saw that something was wrong and at that moment she says lord help him and I'm sitting there thinking is this how I'm gonna go Lord is this how I'm gonna die in the middle of Alabama in Alabama I'm not even in Georgia I'll die in Alabama in the ocean somewhere but God provides the fish for me God provided the vehicle for me amen right some way or another there was a wave that just popped right in and just pushed me right in I don't know how it happened I was able to grab with my feet amen on the shore and was able to walk out amen I know each and every one of us have had close calls in our life some way or another how is it Lord that I got through that if it wasn't for the grace of God because there's something there's something for you and me that we're not done completing here on this life you're here because God is not done with you it's not to make money although that's part of you know you have to live you have to live alright it's not because you have to have girlfriends you know boyfriends you know like you know God has a purpose for you God has a purpose for each and every one of us amen and it wasn't for his grace amen praise God brother Brown says here in that message man running from the presence of the Lord he says oh how many denominational ships have we got going down to Tarshish for the Jonah's of these days 900 of them something our ships I believe there's more of that now there's many more now something our ships that takes the easy route don't want to face up to it Jonah they didn't want to face up the thing of going to the Gentiles he didn't want to take that cruel message over there within 40 days you'll perish if you don't repent he hated to do that I mean you know but God likes to get us out of our comfort zone because you know he wants to teach us lessons and he thought them Gentiles is hard to tell what what they'll do to me but he had to face up to see it see but he took an easy ship and went down to Tarshish went down in the whole of the ship and went to sleep took the easy route that's not sometimes we do we just take the easy route you know we'd rather instead of going 500 miles we'd rather go 2,500 miles to Tarshish and like I said Satan will provide the vehicle for it too you know you know it's an easy way it's a popular way with the people it's easy to take the way where everybody can pat you on the back and say you're a good fellow and this is so and so uncertain and the world will look upon you it's easy to go to the popular way am i it's easy you know it it would be easy for for ministers to get up here by the dáil and by the way to get up here and just preach you know easy sermons God loves you and God cares about you and he does but when that word goes forth can you take it taking criticism amen but that's part of it that's part of doing God's will they meant hey no man that has ever done God's will was not ever criticized or ever talked about every one of them even Jesus so you might as well accept the fact that when you serve the Lord you're going to get criticized when you're trying to when you try to do something for God somebody's going to criticize you when you're trying to young people's young girls you're trying to wear your long skirts and you wear your hair the way the Lord says in the word to do it some there's somebody out there gonna criticize you there's gonna be there's gonna be people that look at the way she wears her hair it's gonna be criticism boys don't wear shorts you're gonna get criticized you're gonna get criticized but when you have and this is so and so uncertain the world will look upon you it's easy to go to the popular way but when when you have to do something different when you have to stand to your conviction of what you know to be the truth there's where the hard part that's that's the rub comes right there amen praise God are you willing to take the the hard route or the either are you willing to take God's Way have it your way or the Lord's way amen I want to have it God's Way and I know that if I'm a child and daughter or God amen even if I have to go through if I get off course God said okay that's fine I'm gonna teach you a lesson out of this and other people are gonna be affected by it as well amen don't don't you know sometimes God you know the Lord allows that those things in our in our lives and maybe there's no just no other way to learn lessons in life you know but to go those hard routes but God knows our beginning from there and and he has he has everything already prepared prepared amen and nothing takes God by surprise that's the thing nothing takes God by surprise you know you being here and you going through whatever you're going through whatever's happened in your life you know God didn't say oh my goodness why is that happening to him that's not what I it's not what I saw no God saw that exactly but God knows that there's a solution for it as well I'm thankful for that amen so no matter what your problem is Saints no matter what's going on in your life Amen let's just trust in God let's put it over to him and let's just be thankful during the times amen once trials and tribulations are in our midst amen just like Jonah man he was in the fish's belly nowhere else to turn nowhere else to go no one to call no one to go but look up amen to look up amen and and to seek Him amen that's the time to seek Him a lot of people think when problems are coming in their life and bad things are happening in their life well that that means God doesn't love me God God's not worried about my situation and they feel that that is the excuse for them to just stop serving the Lord that's the time for you to draw closer to God amen because they meant something is something as God is doing something I always ask myself you know situations and whatever it is I meant I always say Lord what are you trying to teach me in this in this situation what are you trying to teach me Amen what what is it that you're that I'm not getting that's that's the hidden under part we see the superficial part death sickness disease problems you know sexual problems whatever the issues may be but Lord what is it that you're trying to do underneath that's what I want to know Lord that's that's my desire and I trusted that is your desire to know any man those guys so let's cling on to the Lord more Saints amen so let's let's have the musicians come amen praise God why don't we sing that song what's the name of it love lifted me love lifted me maybe maybe the key of uh maybe the key of e-flat sister Joyce just enjoys
