[6:36] Community foot washing
[6:38] um also I sent out that WhatsApp about
[6:40] Father's Day and I didn't get any
[6:42] replies but one so fathers you all need
[6:44] to think about what we want to do I did
[6:47] look at that cabin that we used to get
[6:49] in Helen it is available that weekend of
[6:52] Father's Day so if you'd like to do that
[6:53] again we need to discuss that among
[6:56] ourself and uh see if we want to do that
[6:59] or or go over to the uh to the pond like
[7:02] we did last year so we'll we'll decide
[7:04] on that but just be thinking about it
[7:05] also I know all of you
[7:09] uh we've been
[7:11] um working with the group in Ohio for
[7:14] now almost two years
[7:16] uh they came out of a church
[7:19] that
[7:21] um there was some disagreement with
[7:24] Doctrine
[7:25] and and most of you know the the details
[7:28] but you don't need to know the details
[7:29] all of them they just left the church
[7:32] because of certain things all right
[7:35] and then
[7:38] their dad had already left and he had
[7:40] been watching us online since like 2015
[7:43] and he's been trying to get them I mean
[7:45] the suns are always a little bit
[7:47] hard-headed except me and and uh
[7:51] Donnie
[7:54] we can't say that can't we it's okay
[7:57] but they were a little bit hard-headed
[8:00] and a little slow they're not watching
[8:01] in today they're doing something
[8:02] different today but yeah slow too but um
[8:06] they came to watching us online now most
[8:09] of you know the back side of it now that
[8:11] they're they watch us every service they
[8:14] send their tithe to us religiously
[8:16] religiously they send their tithing they
[8:19] send their offerings and their gifts to
[8:21] us whatever we need they're a part of
[8:23] this church all right but they don't
[8:24] have a pastor and they consider us to be
[8:27] the pastor of of the group up there of
[8:30] about 14 people and they have a couple
[8:32] of extra ones that are coming now
[8:34] so back several months ago it well
[8:38] actually when we went up there in July
[8:39] when all of us went in July I kind of
[8:43] got all the men together in the church
[8:44] and I told them I said look I said you
[8:47] guys need a pastor
[8:49] it's okay to watch online and it's okay
[8:52] to you know there's a lot of people
[8:53] doing in the message but I don't agree
[8:55] with it not for a length of time
[8:59] not for a length of time temporary not a
[9:01] problem
[9:02] but a length of time you need somebody
[9:04] to look you in the eye
[9:06] that's why I take Ministries and stuff
[9:08] like that no
[9:10] no don't work well the Bible said it
[9:12] wouldn't work you can't be perfected
[9:14] that way so you got to have somebody and
[9:16] brother Ryan tells us that a pastor has
[9:19] to be the Shepherd in other words he's
[9:21] even got to smell like a sheep
[9:26] but they know him by his smell because
[9:29] he lives with him brother Ryan says the
[9:30] pastor lives with his people all right
[9:32] so it has to be
[9:35] um even in the absence you know brother
[9:36] Dale there then you've got there
[9:38] somebody's got to be taking this thing
[9:40] and keep going all right because we are
[9:42] sheep we and I need it as much as you
[9:44] need it we we need a head we need a
[9:47] pastor we need somebody we can go talk
[9:48] to somebody that we can can relate with
[9:50] and somebody that on Sunday he gets on
[9:52] you to a little bit on you a little bit
[9:54] about some of the things that's going on
[9:56] because he does have discernment and he
[9:58] does have part of the fivefold ministry
[10:00] the pastor kind of covers all those and
[10:03] we know that but we don't cover them all
[10:05] in his fullness that's why we bring
[10:06] people in to evangelists and teachers
[10:10] and different ones if we can find a
[10:12] prophet we bring him in
[10:14] but you've got those different Falls
[10:16] that that me as being this every Sunday
[10:19] but you got to have that every Sunday
[10:21] service for your recharging and for
[10:23] somebody to you know be with you and and
[10:26] nurture you in in the Lord I kind of
[10:29] wanted to get to that last night in the
[10:30] Bible study about planting seed but um
[10:33] we'll get to it maybe later on
[10:35] so I told him I said you can't have you
[10:39] can't consider me or or the ministry of
[10:42] this church that can't be a pastor for a
[10:44] length of time
[10:46] temporarily yes
[10:48] but from where they came out of there
[10:50] are several churches in Ohio
[10:53] but they all teach the same thing for
[10:55] what they came out of so they can't pull
[10:56] from the pool of people
[10:59] in another church or or a pastor didn't
[11:02] come out or a minister didn't come out
[11:04] and say well I don't agree with brother
[11:06] so and so I'm going to start my own
[11:07] church they just came out and then so
[11:10] fell in love with a ministry here and as
[11:13] brother Isaac he'd they'll be watching
[11:15] this later on will tell you they were
[11:17] they realized sitting under the ministry
[11:19] of this church now I'm talking about all
[11:21] now they've listened to brother Dale
[11:22] since 2015.
[11:24] and going on back to Family Matters and
[11:27] all the different series that we've been
[11:28] preaching for
[11:30] since the 2010 I think it was they're
[11:33] sitting there watching and bringing it
[11:35] up online from the website so they're
[11:37] not sitting there not doing anything
[11:39] they're wanting but they realized they
[11:41] were so far behind
[11:44] that they needed to catch up
[11:46] and I told him I said if you're going to
[11:48] catch up you're going to have to need
[11:49] somebody to pastor this church because I
[11:53] can't do it I've seen people there's a
[11:54] brother that does it in Tennessee and
[11:56] when he gets older he will not be able
[11:58] to do it he passes the church on
[11:59] Saturday and then he passes the church
[12:01] on Sunday that is not the way the Bible
[12:03] set up that is not the way brother
[12:05] Branham set it up that's not the way I
[12:07] don't think God set it up either all
[12:09] right now if you have to watch online
[12:11] like this people like sister Johnny
[12:12] sister Freda different ones that's okay
[12:15] and we have people streaming right now
[12:17] that can't get to this church but it's
[12:19] because they can't get to this church
[12:20] it's not because they want to sit in
[12:22] their slippers and watch online
[12:25] see that's easy to do there's no
[12:29] overcoming we had to overcome to get
[12:30] here amen we had to overcome to get up
[12:33] this morning to get here and then what
[12:36] we're going to do sit here and just
[12:37] listen to me ramble no I believe God's
[12:39] give you something to listen to and
[12:42] something to take into your heart and
[12:43] then what live it yeah go after the door
[12:45] we've always sat down greatest gift we
[12:47] can give brother
[12:49] damn we can put his picture on the wall
[12:51] on your wall we can give him cars and
[12:54] boats and planes
[12:56] plane
[12:58] that's one thing we haven't got planned
[13:01] but listen we can give him all that and
[13:03] that's fine and that makes life happy
[13:04] and that makes everything good and cozy
[13:07] but he'd rather see you live it
[13:11] and for you to be come to that headship
[13:14] where no one else will come to he wants
[13:16] to preach you to that and then he can
[13:18] sit back and look at it and say I have
[13:20] done my job
[13:22] as Paul said I've done my job I've run
[13:24] my race I there's before me a Crown of
[13:27] Life
[13:27] and to me that's why uh and and I was
[13:31] listening to brother Donnie this morning
[13:33] just for a little while brother Johnny
[13:35] Reagan and he was preaching on the same
[13:37] basically the same thing but he said a
[13:40] successful pastor
[13:42] is not somebody that can tickle your
[13:44] feelings
[13:45] it's not somebody that can make you feel
[13:47] good or or cozy in warm it's a pastor
[13:51] that can get you born again
[13:54] bottom line it's a pastor that can get
[13:56] you born again if you and brother down
[13:58] started with 12. then we've had other
[14:00] people come in you know other ministers
[14:01] and different ones but not a pastor so
[14:03] we can see this is the fruit of what
[14:06] has been preached as we were trying to
[14:08] get to the seed last night because the
[14:11] seed is the word it's the word being
[14:12] sown all right not a not a sperm or a
[14:15] little seed something Little Dot
[14:16] floating around in your body somewhere
[14:19] but he's preached the word of God and
[14:21] people not people Christians have been
[14:24] come from that
[14:27] um as a testimony I'll tell you this and
[14:29] it's going to surprise Mom and Dad
[14:32] we were sitting yesterday at Cafe I sat
[14:34] with them old men sorry I sat with them
[14:36] old man and then when I get up they said
[14:38] where are you going I said I'm going to
[14:39] work so you don't have to
[14:41] and they say just keep going so I can
[14:42] get my check
[14:44] but we were sitting there talking about
[14:47] um my cousin Terry was talking about how
[14:49] long our church had been because the
[14:51] Methodist Church is fixing to just split
[14:53] wide open
[14:54] there's going to be some church
[14:56] buildings available because there some
[14:59] people said they're quitting the
[15:00] Methodist they're not going to they're
[15:01] going to dissolve a certain part of it
[15:02] and dad's brother Marshall is one of the
[15:05] ministers that's that's very prominent
[15:07] in this area everybody knows Marshall
[15:09] Dale and he's been here before
[15:12] so we were talking about churches and
[15:15] Terry pops up and he says well brother
[15:16] he said that he said Samuel which is his
[15:19] uncle said he did it right said he just
[15:21] bought the church to begin with said
[15:22] he'll have to see throw everybody out
[15:24] and he had to keep it to South
[15:26] I said well that'll work that way he
[15:28] said I know he said I drove by the other
[15:29] day and he said your parking lot was so
[15:31] full and he said I like that
[15:33] so he said well when did the church get
[15:35] established I said well in 1971 and my
[15:39] other cousin Roy Turpin was sitting over
[15:42] there across from me and he popped up
[15:43] and he said no it wasn't
[15:46] and I thought how you know you weren't
[15:47] here
[15:48] he said no he said that church started
[15:50] at General Motors
[15:54] because he worked at GM with that he
[15:57] said that church started General Motors
[15:59] said he was preaching to a group of
[16:01] people some of them's already passed
[16:03] over by the cauley's a recipient of it
[16:04] brother dick brother Al uh Brother Dean
[16:08] different ones brother Tom they all
[16:11] worked at GM so that so he popped up and
[16:13] said no I didn't start in 1971 he said
[16:15] it's 30 when he started preaching they'd
[16:17] take they'd have 30 minute lunch
[16:19] and they would have church meeting
[16:22] I don't know if they eat or not it
[16:23] probably it didn't matter they ain't
[16:24] worried about but brother Dale then
[16:26] gathered a group together and then they
[16:28] just brought him up here
[16:30] so it was good to know there's a
[16:31] testimony of a man that never stepped
[16:33] foot in this church
[16:35] which was Roy which is he's a Methodist
[16:37] but he he knew one thing's for sure that
[16:40] brother Dale had started Church before
[16:41] he started this one he started it down
[16:43] at General Motors and just brought it
[16:45] here so that's a good that to me that's
[16:47] a testimony and then and um of the of
[16:50] the longevity too of like as brother
[16:52] Donnie said a real Pastor stays with the
[16:54] people helps them grow and they sure
[16:56] they grow in numbers but I want to grow
[16:58] in stature not statue stature all right
[17:00] to where we can be a Powerhouse for God
[17:03] and that's why we've been talking for
[17:05] now 98 sermons on this so let me get to
[17:08] the uh what I want to tell you
[17:11] there was no one
[17:13] that was um
[17:15] I wasn't going
[17:16] and Bob and them's not going it's be
[17:20] hard to move to Ohio
[17:22] so from July till yesterday
[17:26] I'd been working with them
[17:29] and working on getting this rectified or
[17:31] getting a solution to their to their
[17:33] issue
[17:34] try to get them to cut the cord if you
[17:37] might say
[17:38] I not so much cut to court and we never
[17:40] hear from them or see them again but
[17:43] they elected a pastor yesterday
[17:45] and it was uh brother Isaac Negron
[17:54] now
[17:58] he's been see we've been trying to keep
[18:00] this a little bit under wraps tonight
[18:01] people yeah I hate that can't we just
[18:05] get behind him
[18:07] we just get behind him
[18:09] just get behind him forget about all
[18:11] this other junk call us yak
[18:14] but he has been speaking for several
[18:16] months since January actually
[18:19] um on like a three-month basis and I've
[18:21] been listening in and and uh and kind of
[18:24] nurture name up and then the whole
[18:26] church agreed that they needed a pastor
[18:29] and that he could fulfill that
[18:33] without uh having us
[18:37] be every service they have to to watch
[18:39] in
[18:40] all right so there the name now they
[18:43] named the church a long time ago but
[18:45] it's a lighthouse of Refuge in Lorain
[18:47] Ohio so that's what they're going under
[18:49] now Lighthouse of Refuge I think brother
[18:51] Aaron denim
[18:53] um a plaque so we've been kind of
[18:55] working toward that I know I know some
[18:57] of you may not agree with what we were
[19:00] doing but you know what I'm not going to
[19:01] ever leave anybody behind
[19:03] never will I put somebody in a boat and
[19:06] shove them out I'm glad God didn't put
[19:09] you in a boat and shove you out in the
[19:10] water and said fend for yourself
[19:13] help
[19:14] we're here to help the body we're here
[19:16] to help the body not cut the parts off
[19:18] all right so we're just going to pray
[19:20] for brother Isaac and and I'm going to
[19:22] go up probably in three or four weeks
[19:24] and and speak with them and they've
[19:27] already got the church set up they set
[19:28] it up just like ours they've been paying
[19:31] tithe here so now the tithe will be
[19:33] going to the ministry there at the
[19:35] Lighthouse of refuge and brother Isaac
[19:37] will be the pastor there so we will
[19:40] they're still going to stream in
[19:42] uh listen those guys let me tell you
[19:43] what they do how they on Sunday morning
[19:46] they watch us no not today but they
[19:48] watch Us online Sunday morning
[19:50] Sunday afternoon
[19:53] they stream Us in and then they go and
[19:55] and go to the archive sermons and pull
[19:58] up another one so they're like three and
[19:59] four sermons a day Wednesday night
[20:02] Wednesday night they they stream and
[20:04] then they go home and listen to a
[20:05] service
[20:06] uh whatever like brother Dale preaching
[20:09] on um I can't remember the one that but
[20:11] the seals and the different things they
[20:13] listen extra so they know they're not
[20:15] dilatory they're not people that that I
[20:18] don't trust
[20:19] I trust him so I trust listen I trust
[20:22] their decision
[20:23] because listen
[20:24] I'm like what brother Brown said the
[20:26] pastor's only got one vote
[20:29] sure he's the final say sure he's the
[20:32] headship of the church but he's just got
[20:34] one vote
[20:37] you have the vote
[20:39] you are the ones that put people in and
[20:41] take people out not one person
[20:44] except the Lord Jesus by the holy spirit
[20:46] so they voted him in yesterday and I
[20:48] appreciate him and I love him with the
[20:50] love of the Lord so let's stand our feet
[20:51] we'll get started I just want to let you
[20:53] know because you know send them some
[20:55] Atta boys and send them some you know
[20:58] um I don't believe in luck but send them
[20:59] some prayers send them some blessings
[21:01] and say we're behind you we're with you
[21:03] there like I said they're still going to
[21:04] stream in uh I think on Wednesday night
[21:07] now they're going to stream it stream Us
[21:09] in to keep going
[21:11] um so Isaac doesn't have to preach so
[21:13] much three or four times I don't see how
[21:14] in the world brother Dale did it
[21:17] just getting two services on Sunday it's
[21:19] killing me and he got two services on
[21:22] Sunday one on Wednesday had no backup no
[21:24] help he had the lead singing and he
[21:26] worked 40 something hours at General
[21:28] Motors and drove an hour and a half down
[21:30] an hour and a half back so praise God
[21:34] Rest
[21:36] Ranch for a little while
[21:39] unless some of us Young Folks do
[21:41] something
[21:43] but they're going to stream in they're
[21:45] always going to be a Bible study so we
[21:46] haven't wasted our money to to zoom uh
[21:50] uh they're still going to be with the
[21:51] Bible study with us and
[21:54] um like I said streaming on Wednesday
[21:55] and then they will be watching online
[21:59] but not live because today is the first
[22:02] day that brother Isaac is speaking to
[22:05] the people there at in Lorraine so we
[22:09] appreciate the Lord we appreciate what
[22:10] he's done for us
[22:12] we appreciate that we've had a pastor
[22:14] for 50 years we hadn't had to go look
[22:16] for one amen
[22:18] so we've got we've been blessed
[22:22] we've been blessed
[22:24] we all have been blessed and I hope that
[22:28] goes in a testimony somewhere
[22:29] [Applause]
[22:32] today
[22:34] if y'all know what I mean
[22:36] that do know what I mean
[22:40] Lord bless your sister Barbara good to
[22:41] have you with us today
[22:43] so y'all know where we're going with
[22:44] that all right so we're gonna speak
[22:47] today just for a minute and then we will
[22:49] uh uh try to maybe get the bulk of it
[22:52] this afternoon so let's buy our heads
[22:55] yes ma'am
[23:02] so he's out of the nest what
[23:05] as of today I ain't getting it
[23:09] yes I'll still be working with them
[23:10] personally
[23:12] yes okay yeah like
[23:15] 30 minutes this morning on the phone
[23:16] yeah before I got here yeah
[23:19] so I mean yeah they're babies
[23:22] and like I said the cord's been cut but
[23:24] you still once you cut the cord you
[23:26] still got to feed the youngin all right
[23:27] you still got to die for him and you got
[23:29] to put you know you got to put you can't
[23:31] he can't find his own food so he gotta
[23:33] feed him a little bit so know that we
[23:35] will not cut them off at all
[23:38] it's just that the importance of them
[23:40] having a pastor has been taken away from
[23:42] this church and had been placed on them
[23:45] to take care of some of their issues and
[23:47] things that they have because uh we all
[23:49] have issues we all have things and and
[23:51] really pray for him because it's family
[23:53] all right so just keep them in prayer so

[26:02] pray for each one they've already
[26:04] established they've got deacons they've
[26:05] got um trustees they used our same
[26:08] Charter and um so they're just kind of
[26:11] filling in those parts and so they have
[26:14] everything pretty much set up already
[26:16] we've been working on that it's not just
[26:18] something we called yesterday and said
[26:20] this is what we need to do we've been
[26:22] working since July so and I didn't want
[26:25] to burden any of you with it and I
[26:26] didn't want to hear your
[26:30] anything about it
[26:33] I just want to hear positive things
[26:36] they're a body they're a bride listen I
[26:39] I wish we had that Zeal all of us had
[26:43] the same Zeal to listen to three or four
[26:45] tapes a day to make to know that we're a
[26:47] little bit behind and we got to catch up
[26:48] and not miss a service
[26:50] all right and they've been working on
[26:52] well sister Melissa's been taking piano
[26:54] lessons so they're working toward
[26:57] you know having a service where they've
[26:59] got instruments and and some of you
[27:01] that's watched them or they've got
[27:03] plenty of instruments to play with they
[27:05] just didn't have a piano player so
[27:07] sister Melissa took it upon herself to
[27:09] take piano lessons so she they're buying
[27:11] her a piano small like we got the
[27:14] Cleveland over downstairs and they're
[27:16] buying her a small piano and she's
[27:18] learning how to play and then this
[27:19] afternoon they're gonna all practice
[27:21] song so they're not just sitting up
[27:23] there on their heels they are doing
[27:25] something for God so we're just going to
[27:27] put our shoulder to the wheel with them
[27:28] and we're going to ask the Lord to
[27:30] anoint them
[27:32] as a church right so this is part 98 in
[27:35] the beginning was the word where it was
[27:36] with God and the Word was God and that
[27:39] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[27:40] and we beheld his glory the glory of the
[27:42] only begotten of the father
[27:44] full of grace and truth
[27:46] II Peter 1 says and besides this giving
[27:48] all diligence add to your faith virtue
[27:51] and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[27:53] Temperance Temperance patience and
[27:55] patience
[27:56] godliness and we'll try to get the
[27:57] godliness this afternoon first Timothy 3
[28:00] 16 it says without controversy we're
[28:03] going to look at that because it says
[28:04] without controversy
[28:09] no argument
[28:12] great is the mystery of godliness
[28:15] God was manifest In the Flesh justified
[28:17] in the spirit saint of angels preaching
[28:18] to the Gentiles believed on in this
[28:20] world received up into glory and I'm not
[28:22] adding to the word I'm going back to
[28:24] John 1 1. that word became flesh again
[28:27] in a group of people amen you may be
[28:29] seated in the Lord has blessing to the
[28:30] reading of the word and we know that God
[28:32] had a plan and a purpose and let me read
[28:34] making a way brother Ryan talks here in
[28:36] 1956. he said Jesus died for one purpose
[28:39] and that was to save those who God
[28:41] foreknew would be saved we kind of went
[28:43] through that a little bit in a Bible
[28:45] Study last night
[28:47] and and the Really the good thing about
[28:49] Bible study is is you can broaden for
[28:52] two hours you can broaden the subject
[28:54] created just me trying to hit for
[28:56] knowledge just for a few seconds if
[28:58] you'd have been here last night I
[28:59] wouldn't have to cover this again
[29:00] because we could usually we try to we
[29:02] cover don't we don't we cover what we're
[29:05] I'm going to preach on the next day or
[29:06] even Bible and his in his Sunday school
[29:08] class different ones so and you know
[29:11] what to me that's the Lord because we
[29:13] don't get together like a school
[29:15] and all the all the instructors get
[29:18] together and we said well no we're all
[29:19] going to preach on this right here no we
[29:21] don't do that we don't discuss that
[29:23] all right we let the Lord do it for us
[29:25] and he brings everything together and
[29:27] makes it perfect
[29:28] and that was to save those who God for
[29:31] knew would be saved now remember he
[29:34] would not that people be lost he would
[29:36] that all be saved and come to the glory
[29:39] of the Lord but he knew that there's
[29:40] some people that as I've said many times
[29:43] before the way to understand
[29:44] foreknowledge is to know that God knew
[29:48] it even if he gave Hitler a million
[29:51] years if he let him live let's just say
[29:53] Ten Thousand Years
[29:55] he never would come to repentance
[29:57] because God could see that remember he's
[29:58] infinite he can see all the way
[30:01] past what we can see so he could see
[30:03] that some as we were talking last night
[30:05] some come to a Justified State and a
[30:08] Sanctified State and God knew they
[30:10] couldn't go any further
[30:12] so maybe he'd take them off the scene so
[30:14] they have to don't have to go through
[30:15] the tribulation we were discussing uh
[30:17] this morning or last night brother
[30:19] George that we talk about people that
[30:21] we've been around all of our life and
[30:22] all of a sudden they fall over dead
[30:24] or we've got a family member that that
[30:27] that's just good Christian person then
[30:29] they die
[30:30] and we're so sorrowful but we ought to
[30:33] look at it a different way
[30:35] God has pretty much preserved them in
[30:39] the state they were in
[30:41] put them in a grave put their soul in
[30:43] another dimension and they ain't got to
[30:45] worry about tribulation period they
[30:46] don't have to worry about any of that
[30:48] they just got to worry about coming up
[30:50] to watch on judgment and if they're good
[30:52] to the bride
[30:54] they'll be given eternal life
[30:56] everybody with me with that to me that's
[30:58] the Glorious thing about Grace Grace is
[30:59] not only just to the bride it's not just
[31:02] only the Christians it's the people that
[31:04] are around you that God knows he's going
[31:06] to give eternal life to that we we don't
[31:10] but he does and he is so Sovereign that
[31:13] he can take somebody out of the way
[31:15] so he let Adolf Hitler live his life and
[31:18] then take his own life as they say
[31:19] knowing that if even if Adolf Hitler
[31:22] would have been given another 10 years
[31:23] another 20 years he would have never
[31:25] changed from what he was see to me
[31:28] that's the Providence of God by
[31:30] foreknowledge not putting him in a tube
[31:33] and pulling him through it now about
[31:35] with me on that God did not do that with
[31:37] anybody he did not put him in a tube and
[31:40] make him a robot and say well this is
[31:41] the way it's going to be no he saw your
[31:44] choice to me that's the simplest thing
[31:45] he saw your choice because we choose and
[31:48] I was telling him last night
[31:50] listen even when we get in the
[31:52] Millennium even when we get in the
[31:54] future home we still got to make a
[31:55] choice
[31:57] do I want to go out of the city or do I
[31:59] want to stay here do I want to eat that
[32:00] fruit or do I not want to eat that fruit
[32:01] do I want to go visit brother darty well
[32:04] that's two thousand miles brother
[32:05] Donnie's house I'll be there in about
[32:07] that right there so it doesn't matter
[32:10] that's right God knew there was going to
[32:12] be somebody saved and there had to be a
[32:14] preparation now what is a preparation
[32:16] that's a plan or as we said before a
[32:19] plan is a method of achieving an end so
[32:21] God is as brother Brown tells us that
[32:24] God has a threefold purpose we go back
[32:27] in the back part of God's mind and we
[32:28] see that God had a plan and a purpose
[32:30] well what was it planning the purpose to
[32:32] get us back to Heaven Amen to get us
[32:34] back to the Garden of Eden because
[32:36] remember all God was reported to Christ
[32:38] poured into church
[32:40] took her back to the Garden of Eden he
[32:42] didn't leave her listen he's not leaving
[32:44] us down here he's taking somebody home
[32:46] amen everybody with me
[32:48] and there had to be a preparation or a
[32:51] way made for them to be saved if there
[32:54] wasn't salvation wasn't possible if God
[32:57] foreknew that people would be saved
[32:59] knowing who they were he had to lay a
[33:02] plan down yes
[33:04] and we'll talk about that maybe this
[33:05] afternoon if we get to it
[33:07] election you have to bring election in
[33:10] all right same way with today today you
[33:13] may be born again but still under
[33:15] election you got to decide whether you
[33:16] want to climb this Jacob's Ladder
[33:19] or just stay the Way You Are
[33:22] you choose that
[33:24] you know what the preaching does the
[33:26] preaching just what brother I'm saying
[33:27] open scales to your eyes so you see what
[33:28] God's already done not what God's coming
[33:30] up what God's already done
[33:33] and then you make your choice from that
[33:35] you're still making you're making a
[33:36] choice right now yeah
[33:38] yeah everybody's making choices why does
[33:41] he say he's not willing and then he
[33:42] should perish he isn't he isn't willing
[33:44] that it should pair any should perish
[33:46] but did all might come to repentance but
[33:48] the or in order to be God
[33:51] he has to know who will and who won't or
[33:54] he wasn't God because he's omnipotent
[33:56] I'm I'm the president omniscient he
[33:58] knows every everything he's at every
[34:00] and all powerful so foreknowledge looks
[34:03] back and says that he foresaw this and
[34:06] knows that's the reason he could tell
[34:08] what the end was from the beginning and
[34:11] therefore knowing all these marvelous
[34:12] days that we're living in now listen
[34:14] knowing that even people like Paul and
[34:17] the different ones that were in the
[34:18] first church age they come to a a
[34:21] conclusion or come to a revelation that
[34:24] God was not going to come right then
[34:27] now they preached and it's in the Bible
[34:28] talks about to the coming of the Lord
[34:30] but brother Brown tells us that Paul was
[34:33] trying to get each the Corinthians and
[34:35] them to realize God wasn't coming in
[34:37] their generation
[34:38] God had work to do to seven Church ages
[34:41] and there John stood in that first
[34:43] church age John the Revelator and
[34:46] watched the church ages unfold so he
[34:48] knew that God wasn't coming during his
[34:50] lifetime but now you and
[34:54] somebody you and me
[34:56] and me that's right that's not our
[34:59] conclusion that's not our Administration
[35:01] our Administration has changed our
[35:05] Administration says we're not going by
[35:07] the grave somebody is going to go up not
[35:10] down
[35:12] you got you and you know what you got to
[35:15] decide whether it's you or not
[35:18] so God made a preparation before the
[35:21] foundation of the world
[35:23] he had this plan and the plan is perfect
[35:27] and as we were talking last night
[35:28] somebody had asked
[35:30] the question was is as you start when
[35:33] you start your Christian Journey
[35:35] uh what happens to this group that dies
[35:37] before the
[35:39] um change what happens to these people
[35:42] that have changed the body and what
[35:43] happened to the food's virgin so we got
[35:45] the little chart out that we done and I
[35:47] think Joe's got some pictures of it if
[35:49] you want it uh I know it's online of the
[35:52] Journey of a Christian that journey of
[35:54] actually it's a journey of everybody
[35:55] it's the whole Plan of Redemption say
[35:58] tell them where we go but the people in
[36:01] the end time let's hone in on that the
[36:03] people in the end time today we have a
[36:05] we have a mandate or our Administration
[36:08] tells us that we have got somebody has
[36:11] got to come to a body change so it's not
[36:14] going to be though that there's an x on
[36:16] the calendar and when we get to that day
[36:18] somebody's going to be changed all
[36:19] that's left
[36:21] alive is going to be changed that's not
[36:23] the way God does things
[36:25] that's not the way he put his plan
[36:27] together he put his plan together to
[36:30] send us a prophet in the end time to put
[36:32] the word of God together and then he had
[36:34] big nuggets and we break it down into
[36:36] little nuggets and then you take it and
[36:37] you eat the book right and when you eat
[36:40] the book you realize that we have to
[36:42] have these virtues listen one more time
[36:46] we say well this was just for the end
[36:48] time no it's not
[36:50] from right here down was in the first
[36:54] church age
[36:56] they had these virtues working in their
[36:58] life
[36:59] listen working in their churches
[37:04] when we get to brotherly kindness that's
[37:06] where you're gonna feel it
[37:09] the Bible says they had all things
[37:10] common they brought everything they
[37:11] owned in
[37:13] oh yes right
[37:15] and distribute it out evenly to
[37:17] everybody
[37:19] get ready for your pensions
[37:27] but Michael don't have no pension yet
[37:31] you gotta share with him
[37:34] brother College said all right he'd be
[37:35] the only one in the whole building and
[37:36] say all right
[37:39] but that's probably kindness and you
[37:41] know two people got in trouble and died
[37:42] because they didn't show brotherly
[37:44] kindness
[37:46] for those of you that didn't hey man
[37:47] I'll tell you who it was 99 cents to
[37:49] fire they owned the pieces of properties
[37:51] oh yeah here here's my property here's
[37:53] my here's my property but there was one
[37:55] piece of property they kept in their
[37:57] pocket
[37:58] right and the Holy Ghost discerned that
[38:01] and they died because of it all right
[38:05] just telling you that's what brother
[38:06] Brown talks about brotherly kindness
[38:08] read that
[38:09] now God comes down to cool of the day
[38:11] now look that's the purpose of the Holy
[38:13] Ghost we're gonna fly through this it's
[38:14] a father again God the Father dwelling
[38:16] in you look working out his plans to
[38:19] finish his Plan of Redemption working
[38:21] what through you making you a co-worker
[38:24] so we got to be where as we were talking
[38:26] about vulcanization we've got to be
[38:28] vulcanized to what we're talking about
[38:30] right now
[38:31] amen all right are you going to get left
[38:33] behind there is a there is a movie
[38:35] called Left Behind it's going on right
[38:36] now
[38:40] but you're left behind is going to be
[38:41] worse than they're left behind
[38:44] because you know too much
[38:46] you can't be a foolish virgin and sit in
[38:48] this church I promise you that
[38:50] foreign
[38:52] giving you a place giving you a part of
[38:54] your Fallen lost brother and sister
[38:55] giving you his spirit and his love to go
[38:57] hunt the lost as he did in the Garden of
[39:00] Eden Adam Adam Where Art Thou that's
[39:02] what the Holy Spirit does to a man or a
[39:04] woman when it strikes into their heart
[39:06] and takes Abode there's a thirst and a
[39:08] hungering for lost souls that's what the
[39:10] matter with the meetings today there's
[39:12] not enough Spirit touching it to go for
[39:14] the souls of the Lost and the dying it's
[39:16] more like making a name or a church or a
[39:18] building or a denomination instead of a
[39:20] soul-winning program how pitiful
[39:22] I'm just reading what the brother what
[39:24] brother Brown said now brother rammstead
[39:26] and in Christ Mission Gardnerville said
[39:28] look back in the back part of God's mind
[39:29] there was something that he was trying
[39:31] and going to achieve now he saw the
[39:34] picture unfold
[39:36] he saw the plan unfold because it was in
[39:39] his mind can't change that's right can't
[39:41] change he knows who did and who did who
[39:43] I mean who would who wouldn't but we
[39:45] don't
[39:46] that's right that's why they asked
[39:47] brother around said well brother Brown
[39:48] if God knows everything why are you
[39:49] preaching he said I throw the net out he
[39:52] said I get frogs lizards and I get fish
[39:55] every once in a while all right so that
[39:57] doesn't do away with Ministry it makes
[39:59] it more important
[40:01] now back in the back part of God's mind
[40:03] there was something he was trying and
[40:05] going to achieve and look he had a
[40:07] motive
[40:08] in doing it brother Robert said check
[40:10] your motive and objective God's motive
[40:12] and objective was was to get us out of
[40:14] this condition that we're in right now
[40:16] praise God get us out of this condition
[40:19] that we're in right now why do we want
[40:21] to stay in this condition
[40:24] in order to let himself be expressed
[40:27] through what stars moon no you yes right
[40:30] amen
[40:32] that's
[40:33] and by with me
[40:35] join his great mind he wanted this now
[40:37] if it stayed in his mind he wasn't God
[40:41] if it stayed in his mind he wasn't God
[40:44] but he had to let it Loose because you
[40:47] and I were in there
[40:49] the bride was in there even the foolish
[40:51] version even the people that are given a
[40:53] cup of water they were in his mind but
[40:55] as we were man brother Joe Canada were
[40:57] talking about the sections of a book
[41:00] there's a lounge Book of Life and then
[41:02] there's an eternal section
[41:04] you can be taken out of one but you
[41:06] can't be taken out of the other Judas
[41:08] was taken out of one but once you're put
[41:11] in the Eternal section Revelations 13 8
[41:13] you can't lose
[41:17] right and there's not there's not a book
[41:19] and an angel up there racing your name
[41:21] it's just telling where you and I can
[41:24] understand what's going on
[41:26] when we get to the watch on judgment and
[41:28] we judge others we're not going to have
[41:30] a book right here and it just go
[41:33] well
[41:35] no you know what you'll know
[41:38] if you missed it you'll know why you
[41:41] missed it you'll know why you're
[41:43] standing right here and not standing
[41:45] right here
[41:48] get quiet on me that's okay
[41:50] you'll know God will not have to tell
[41:53] you why you didn't make it
[41:55] you will know why you didn't make it
[41:57] brother Brown said there'd be a still
[41:58] Small Voice tell you you missed it
[42:01] wow
[42:03] wow
[42:05] let's continue on
[42:07] let's skip that we know about deep call
[42:09] of the deep there's got to be something
[42:11] at once there's something there's
[42:13] something desirous of man about wanting
[42:15] to be more like God it's just that we do
[42:17] it with as Bob said we we take our
[42:20] passion and we put it on this that or
[42:23] the other instead of God we all have a
[42:25] thirst for for a being
[42:28] that's like I want to talk to this y'all
[42:30] I know some of you are not from here but
[42:32] there was an atheist went to the meeting
[42:35] at the Lewis city council right up here
[42:37] well I know the mayor he's a he's a
[42:39] nominal Christian man he works for the
[42:41] post office too but he wouldn't allow he
[42:44] said a prayer and he wouldn't allow the
[42:46] atheist atheists to say a prayer I said
[42:49] why are atheists even praying
[42:52] what are they praying to
[42:54] an atheist don't believe in a superior
[42:56] being
[42:58] I thought if I was there that's what I
[43:00] got going okay buddy who you praying to
[43:02] let me know who you praying to
[43:04] because you have just not you have just
[43:06] become an unatheist if you have a being
[43:09] that you pray to you have because an
[43:12] atheist doesn't believe in no God they
[43:13] actually believe that they are the the
[43:15] you are the higher intelligent higher
[43:17] power I'd really like to talk to him
[43:19] about that but
[43:23] that's just the way the world is
[43:26] and they still having issues with it up
[43:28] there
[43:29] Genesis 5 22 says Enoch walked with God
[43:34] after he got Methuselah
[43:36] I want y'all to understand something too
[43:38] we've um there was a question yesterday
[43:40] or last night after the Bible study
[43:43] about
[43:45] um the moment of silence
[43:47] now we got to remember when we keep our
[43:49] types correctly Enoch type 2.
[43:53] the bride
[43:55] know what type what if it was virgin
[43:58] right they had to go over the
[44:01] tribulation
[44:02] all right and then come out
[44:06] Enoch walked with God and left so all
[44:10] that that connects with the Seven Seals
[44:12] and all the different things that
[44:13] connects with Enoch that does not
[44:16] connect with Noah
[44:17] so you can't type them together you
[44:19] gotta type them separate because people
[44:22] say oh yeah we got in the safety of the
[44:23] Ark and Noah no Noah tie it
[44:28] the foolish virgin
[44:30] Enoch type the bride all right so let's
[44:33] keep everything straight but you know
[44:35] what with God there is nothing we know
[44:36] about Enoch except he walked
[44:40] he walked with God and was not for God
[44:43] took him what are you saying walk
[44:47] with God amen amen and as I was saying
[44:50] last night
[44:51] when we get to the patients in just a
[44:53] few minutes patience is not you sitting
[44:55] on your honey
[44:59] waiting on God to bring you something
[45:02] with your shoes on your slippers on and
[45:04] you got your feet propped up in your
[45:05] house well bro wait and the Bible says
[45:07] for us to be patient
[45:09] Paul says run with patience this race
[45:14] that's right yeah
[45:16] the man has anybody ever seen a race
[45:17] where everybody sit in the couch
[45:21] I've seen them idiots try to get on the
[45:23] couch and put wheels on it race it down
[45:24] the road
[45:27] I said idiots sorry about that but um
[45:31] that would be if you put wheels on a on
[45:33] a couch
[45:34] so these are the generations of Noah and
[45:36] always a just man and perfect in his
[45:38] generations and Noah walked with God
[45:42] so God's power to transform watch what
[45:44] brothers Brown says
[45:46] this is the new one I put in here we
[45:48] were talking about last night here we go
[45:50] back to I'm sorry that I'm referring to
[45:51] last night but there was so much within
[45:53] that two hours that I'm covering today
[45:55] that um they would have helped you if
[45:57] you'd have been here
[46:00] um
[46:01] we were talking about a corn plant
[46:03] coming up and we have maypops everybody
[46:07] know what a map is
[46:08] I know some of us older ones know
[46:10] because we used to throw them at each
[46:11] other
[46:13] and they would pop that's why they're
[46:15] called
[46:16] made pops they grow on a vine they have
[46:19] this real pretty flower but they will
[46:21] literally pull your corn to the ground
[46:24] because they have runners
[46:26] but that little thing about that big
[46:27] round that's caught this the little
[46:29] fruit on it brother John I don't know if
[46:31] you ever you're not old enough but men
[46:32] Terence in different ones we'd have
[46:34] fights with them because you're throwing
[46:35] at each other and it hit it and it
[46:37] popped because it opened up that's why
[46:39] they called them
[46:41] and they blame
[46:46] it so brother Brown knows this he calls
[46:48] them creepers
[46:50] for if you didn't get those Creepers out
[46:52] where the corn was in the row like this
[46:54] then the creeper would reach over grab a
[46:56] hold of that corn and wrap itself around
[46:58] gradually what are you saying by the way
[47:00] remember what we were trying to get into
[47:02] last night there's a seed that comes up
[47:04] it germinates comes up out of the ground
[47:06] and then it gets choked out
[47:10] because you stopped walking
[47:12] you don't get these Creepers out
[47:14] I like what it's called creepers
[47:18] who wants a creep in their life no grab
[47:21] a hold of that coin and wrap it around
[47:23] gradually so easy so sly
[47:27] that you'd hardly tell it was wrapped
[47:31] and finally it gets stronger and
[47:32] stronger and it pulls that corn till
[47:35] it's deformed
[47:36] listen to what he's talking about pulls
[47:39] it against itself wraps it around its
[47:41] own Vine deforming form it from what it
[47:44] was now remember it was corn it's still
[47:47] corn but it's now deformed corn
[47:50] from what it was to something else yet
[47:52] it's corn but it's deformed corn and we
[47:55] are look and we are still in the image
[47:58] of God but some are so deformed as sons
[48:02] of God that ought to hit you right
[48:04] between us mine did me when I read that
[48:07] he's talking about sons of God he's not
[48:09] talking about
[48:11] somebody off the street drunk he's
[48:14] talking about sons of God sons of God
[48:17] get caught in that look that walk
[48:19] contrary to his word
[48:24] and to the way that he had us and
[48:27] provided for us to walk what's the plan
[48:31] just letting something the world twist
[48:33] us out of the way
[48:35] pull us close to it and away from that
[48:38] straight narrow strip that he planted Us
[48:42] in to be Sons and Daughters of God sin
[48:45] has done this evil thing to the Sons and
[48:49] Daughters of God
[48:50] now that ought to make you
[48:52] sh shiver in your liver that we were
[48:55] talking about last night shivering your
[48:57] liver because you know what that talk
[48:59] about Sons and Daughters of God me and
[49:01] you
[49:03] we can get to life choked out of us if
[49:05] we don't go up this statue of perfect
[49:06] man
[49:08] you can be a stumped Christian
[49:13] who wants that
[49:18] just getting a plan folks it's just so
[49:20] simple to get in the plan
[49:22] do the what the word of God says that's
[49:24] what we've been trying brother Dale's
[49:25] been trying Bob brother Louise brother
[49:27] Aaron myself we've been trying to tell
[49:29] you what the word of God says if you
[49:31] don't do it it's your fault
[49:33] all right
[49:35] you've never heard a preacher stand
[49:37] behind this Pulpit say now I know the
[49:38] Bible says but you really don't have to
[49:40] do that
[49:41] right right never have you heard that so
[49:45] whose fault is it if you interpret that
[49:48] in your little brain
[49:51] yeah creepers
[49:54] creepers
[49:55] creep in
[49:57] and take that good looking big old corn
[50:00] plant
[50:03] pull that thing over
[50:06] and be totally deformed
[50:09] right but yet still be a son and
[50:11] daughter of God
[50:13] wow
[50:15] you're quiet
[50:16] all right let's go Temperance Temperance
[50:19] now look how to answer in kindness when
[50:21] wrath is spoken let's continue through
[50:23] that let's go to patience we before we
[50:25] gotta get through here in just a second
[50:27] in the New Testament remember the word
[50:30] the word patience is not in the Old
[50:32] Testament
[50:34] the literal word patience starts in the
[50:37] New Testament
[50:38] all right so
[50:40] the Bible says in your patience possess
[50:43] ye your souls all right
[50:46] join the new test it The Testament the
[50:48] characteristics of a man who is not
[50:49] swerved from his deliberate purpose what
[50:52] gets in the plan of God which never
[50:54] swears
[50:55] it's never pulled down by a creeper you
[50:58] allow he pulled down by a creeper I
[51:01] allowed to be pulled down by a creeper
[51:03] amen what is a creeper your own ideas
[51:06] and my own ideas contrary to the word of
[51:09] God
[51:12] and his loyalty to Faith and piety by
[51:15] even the greatest love trials and
[51:17] sufferings patiently and steadfast
[51:20] steadfast waiting for remember Simeon
[51:23] was 80 something years old it's not
[51:26] recorded where God spoke to him but the
[51:28] Lord spoke to him and said you'll not
[51:30] die till you see the Lord's Christ
[51:32] you'll not die
[51:35] when are we going to realize that that
[51:37] God spoke to us will not die till the
[51:40] Dead come out of the ground
[51:42] they have to be destroyed in a group of
[51:43] people
[51:45] Hebrews 6 verse 10 said for God is Not
[51:47] unrighteous to forget your work and
[51:49] labor of love which you have showed
[51:52] toward his name in that ye have
[51:54] ministered to the Saints and do Minister
[51:55] now continue listen
[51:57] and we desire that every one of you to
[52:00] show the same what Dylan
[52:04] Assurance of Hope what unto the end yes
[52:08] now remember what brother Mills always
[52:10] preached the seven civil programs it was
[52:11] the end of all things it's not the end
[52:13] like things are going to be done away
[52:14] with you can't end God but you can end
[52:18] an Administration you can end a
[52:21] testament we're going to read it tonight
[52:23] or this afternoon when we take communion
[52:26] it what Testament was done away with and
[52:30] the New Testament came into place the
[52:32] Old Testament was bulls and goats the
[52:35] New Testament was the blood of a man
[52:37] blood of God
[52:39] all right so we desire that every one of
[52:41] you do show the same diligence to the
[52:43] full Assurance of Hope unto the end that
[52:46] you be not slothful
[52:49] come on
[52:51] why don't we come to church to sleep
[52:57] I've never come to church
[52:59] and I know it's hard sometimes
[53:03] but I'm gonna tell you one more time you
[53:05] you have never fell asleep at a doctor's
[53:07] office
[53:09] he might have put you to sleep
[53:12] maybe that's what I'm doing
[53:17] praise the Lord anyhow
[53:19] to me this is life to me this is this
[53:22] should supercharge instead of instead of
[53:23] we're just listening and a lot of you
[53:26] that y'all that's all you're doing you
[53:27] just listen you just come to listen
[53:28] and you don't do a lot of that
[53:31] but ye be not slothful
[53:35] you ever seen somebody that I just
[53:38] um Daddy and Terence were talking one
[53:40] time and and this guy I
[53:42] we've got some and you've got some we
[53:44] all know some you know as britches
[53:46] there's three sizes too big his shoes
[53:48] are 12 sizes too big he's just Nothing
[53:52] fits everything's just slouchy and
[53:54] sloppy and they walk like this
[53:59] got hair all the way down to hair that's
[54:02] lawful
[54:04] and they were discussing somebody the
[54:06] other day you know years and years ago
[54:08] and and um
[54:11] on the testimonies that we should be
[54:13] doing
[54:15] the greatest testimony is that that I
[54:18] had a father that wasn't that image
[54:21] I had a father that was that image
[54:24] he was that image he was upright he was
[54:26] a Christian or not he was a better man
[54:29] than most men
[54:31] just by being who they are instead of
[54:33] being slothful
[54:35] so if he would have been that way though
[54:38] poor cancer looked just like he'd look
[54:40] like Ted Nugent back in the 70s
[54:42] praise the Lord if you don't know who
[54:43] that is Google it Luis will tell you
[54:46] maybe in a couple of weeks
[54:51] he's still alive y'all know that his
[54:53] hair's short he's a deer hunter that's
[54:55] why I know him
[55:00] uncle Ted
[55:05] but that's how we grew up
[55:08] we grew up dressing good being clean
[55:10] going to church on Sunday not being
[55:12] slothful
[55:14] not having to get my daddy up I know uh
[55:17] friends of ours we'd have to go to their
[55:19] house
[55:20] and get their daddy out of the bed
[55:22] because he's drunk
[55:25] never had to do that
[55:27] do that and I know if some of you did
[55:29] you rise up above that but what I'm
[55:31] saying is be not slothful the Bible
[55:33] tells us not to be slothful but
[55:36] followers of them who through faith and
[55:38] patience inherit the promises
[55:42] for when God made a promise to Abraham
[55:44] because he could swear by no greater he
[55:46] lifted his hand and he said I'll do it
[55:50] I'll do it
[55:51] uh Adam I I wanted you to do it you
[55:54] can't do it
[55:56] I wanted you to can't do it I'll do it
[56:01] I'll bring this thing to pass in other
[56:03] words I'll make this plan so perfect you
[56:05] can't get out of it
[56:06] it's going to perfect the people we'll
[56:08] talk about that last night tonight how
[56:11] are we going to have white robes how are
[56:12] we going to get blameless how are we
[56:14] going to get perfect
[56:16] there's therefore now no
[56:19] some of you are condemned now because of
[56:21] what I've said
[56:22] because you ain't living the right life
[56:24] but there's therefore now no
[56:26] condemnation to them who are in Christ
[56:29] Jesus who walk
[56:32] get mad
[56:35] yeah Paul was the one that wrote it
[56:36] because you know what he was looking at
[56:38] what was going on in the church
[56:40] Romans Corinthians Philippians they were
[56:43] all churches and people in the church
[56:46] and that's what he was addressing but
[56:48] you know what that same Spirit didn't
[56:49] die it just came over here into the
[56:51] second Church age Third Church Age 4 5 6
[56:53] 7. all right
[56:55] James 1 verse 2 says my brother
[56:57] encountered all joy Joy
[57:01] when you fall into many Temptations
[57:05] Joy
[57:08] hey knowing this that's a trying of your
[57:11] faith
[57:12] worketh patience but let patients have
[57:15] her perfect work
[57:18] that you may be perfect and entire
[57:20] wanting nothing
[57:23] we got to start realizing the Bible's
[57:25] already got all the words we need it's
[57:27] got everything in there exactly the way
[57:31] it's placed and not changeable it is
[57:34] unchanging this Bible is unchanging
[57:37] When It Was Written 1500 years ago in in
[57:40] print form it hasn't changed one word
[57:46] I want to put my faith in that
[57:48] not into shifting Sands of man's ideas
[57:52] he said now you're beginning to reflect
[57:53] the works of Christ but so many of us
[57:56] try to do the works of Christ before the
[57:58] reflection of Christ is in US
[58:02] work work work work work work work work
[58:03] work
[58:04] and why don't you get work on the new
[58:06] birth first
[58:08] get born again get born again then you
[58:11] can start working on these other things
[58:13] right seek ye first to what kingdom of
[58:14] God and then all these other things
[58:17] things will come to pass
[58:20] we find those things happening now
[58:23] there's the trouble you know it I know
[58:24] it now brother Brown where is it there's
[58:26] the trouble
[58:28] we want to do what we think that we can
[58:30] work our way into heaven
[58:32] we think we can tithe our way into
[58:34] heaven
[58:35] no tithing is just you get a blessing if
[58:37] you tithe all right
[58:40] so many of us try to do the works of
[58:42] Christ before the reflection of Christ
[58:44] is in US
[58:45] now there's the trouble we find these
[58:48] things happening you know it I know it
[58:50] we see these stumbles along the road
[58:53] we find the scrap heap of Ministers of
[58:56] Christians piled up along the road is
[58:59] because they didn't go into it right in
[59:01] other words they didn't go by the plan
[59:02] of God
[59:04] and that's why I'm here this morning is
[59:06] to try to teach this little church and
[59:08] myself how that we can become the
[59:10] dwelling place of the Living God
[59:13] how many would like to be that raise
[59:15] your hand say Amen
[59:17] you know why you know why somebody
[59:18] didn't raise your hand because you're
[59:19] scared of it
[59:21] right you're scared of it
[59:24] you better not be you're right
[59:26] but you're scared to be the dwelling
[59:28] place of the Living God
[59:30] don't be scared if you're scared that
[59:33] means the devil's there
[59:35] and then the Bible says flee from him
[59:37] resist him and flee from him
[59:39] and say Lord come on in
[59:42] the Lord is not slack concerning his
[59:44] promise as some men count slackness but
[59:47] his long-suffering that long word
[59:49] long-suffering right here is bare long
[59:53] have patience
[59:56] not willing that any should perish but
[59:58] that all should come to repentance we
[59:59] read that not too long ago that's what
[1:00:01] God wanted he wants everybody to repent
[1:00:04] Greek Lexicon says bear long suffer long
[1:00:07] to be long-suffering that's what long
[1:00:09] suffering means patiently endure we're
[1:00:11] going to look at that word endure in
[1:00:12] this a little bit to be of a long Spirit
[1:00:15] not to lose heart
[1:00:18] two person patiently and bravely in
[1:00:22] enduring
[1:00:23] what
[1:00:25] what
[1:00:27] Misfortune in trouble yeah that's your
[1:00:31] two
[1:00:33] friends
[1:00:35] if you're a human
[1:00:38] to be patient and look now can you do
[1:00:40] this
[1:00:42] to be patient in bearing the offenses
[1:00:44] and injuries of others
[1:00:50] remember brother Brown said one time he
[1:00:51] said if I was God I tell you one time
[1:00:54] if you didn't believe it
[1:00:56] gone
[1:00:58] but God's long-suffering
[1:01:00] 120 years he listened he waited for a
[1:01:04] seven billion people to receive Noah's
[1:01:08] message and knew when he started he was
[1:01:11] only going to get eight
[1:01:14] children of Israel 2 million come out he
[1:01:17] knew by the time they got in the
[1:01:19] original would be too
[1:01:21] yet he yet he he he
[1:01:24] babyed him the whole way
[1:01:26] same way with me and you
[1:01:28] to be patient and bearing the offenses
[1:01:30] of injuries of others to be mild and
[1:01:33] slow to punishment James 5 verse 7 says
[1:01:36] be patient therefore brother unto the
[1:01:38] coming of the Lord behold the husband
[1:01:40] and husbandman which is the bridegroom
[1:01:42] waited for the precious fruit of the
[1:01:45] earth now who's the precious fruit of
[1:01:46] the Earth
[1:01:49] we're it that's us we are the precious
[1:01:52] fruit of the earth he's not worried
[1:01:53] about apples and oranges and pears
[1:01:56] he's worried about me and you yes and
[1:01:59] have the long patience for it until
[1:02:00] receive the early and later ain't be
[1:02:03] also patient establish your hearts for
[1:02:06] the coming of the Lord drawth now more
[1:02:09] now than then
[1:02:11] says fourthly add patience to your faith
[1:02:14] if you got faith it works patience the
[1:02:17] Bible said so this is patience now
[1:02:19] that's the next thing on building this
[1:02:20] stature God's got real material in his
[1:02:24] building and how short we are brother
[1:02:26] and sister see why we're our where we're
[1:02:28] at see why where we're at
[1:02:32] yes sir we have Glory shouts because we
[1:02:36] got faith but when we come down to these
[1:02:38] things here
[1:02:40] God can't build us into that stature
[1:02:43] he can't he can't make us up to that
[1:02:45] kind of a place we got all other things
[1:02:47] these other things we fall slide off we
[1:02:50] can't build his church he can't build
[1:02:52] his church
[1:02:53] the prophet of God sees virtue must be
[1:02:55] in us until we get virtue I've read this
[1:02:57] many times Maria because sometimes it
[1:02:59] stumps you say why faith is just it
[1:03:02] faith is all I got to have no it's not
[1:03:06] Paul says I can have all faith
[1:03:10] know all Mysteries yet have not charity
[1:03:15] I am a sounding brass and a tinkling
[1:03:17] simple symbol
[1:03:20] then when we get true virtue we can add
[1:03:22] it to our faith that's the next
[1:03:24] foundation wall now first you must have
[1:03:26] faith but faith alone won't do it
[1:03:29] I'll shout out 1960 brother Brown said
[1:03:31] then Abraham we find out didn't obey God
[1:03:34] just right he didn't Abraham said get up
[1:03:36] and leave
[1:03:38] he got left but he took a lot with him
[1:03:40] he wasn't told to do that
[1:03:43] see but now in Abraham's heart he's like
[1:03:45] well this is the thing I ought to do no
[1:03:47] it wasn't the thing he ought to do it
[1:03:49] was Authority inside the whole town
[1:03:51] now he made ready and had faith in the
[1:03:54] promise but see we can still
[1:03:58] not obey
[1:04:00] let me read that one more time I put in
[1:04:02] big letters for all those who said
[1:04:04] now he made ready and faith in the
[1:04:06] promise this is Abraham
[1:04:11] and then not obey still it'll hinder us
[1:04:17] wow
[1:04:18] I believe in the Holy Spirit I believe I
[1:04:20] should be baptized with the Holy Spirit
[1:04:22] now no matter how much you believe
[1:04:23] you've got to obey that Commission
[1:04:27] just faith alone won't work because
[1:04:30] faithful that works is dead that's right
[1:04:33] just like the borderline Believers got
[1:04:36] people today you find in the Bible said
[1:04:38] for it's impossible for those which are
[1:04:39] enlightened and may protect us of the
[1:04:41] Holy Ghost to fall away to renew
[1:04:43] themselves and get into repentance
[1:04:44] seeing They Crucified to themselves the
[1:04:46] Son of God afresh and count the blood of
[1:04:48] the Covenant when he was Sanctified
[1:04:50] another holy Unholy thing and done
[1:04:53] despite to the works of Grace and
[1:04:55] Hebrews 10 it says it's a fearful thing
[1:04:57] to fall in the hands of a living God
[1:04:59] and those people you've seen them come
[1:05:02] to church what was talking about this
[1:05:03] last night they'll come and they'll say
[1:05:05] oh yes I believe yeah I got you brother
[1:05:07] Dale I'm with you I'm with you by the
[1:05:08] way I'm with y'all I'm with you I'm with
[1:05:10] you I'm with him wait a minute I'm with
[1:05:11] you I'm with you now I'm with you but
[1:05:14] they believe
[1:05:15] but they'll never
[1:05:22] actually we become hindrances
[1:05:25] you ain't man if you want to I'll amen
[1:05:27] because we because we I said we
[1:05:30] we become hindrances
[1:05:32] you're gonna blame it on God
[1:05:35] thank you you're gonna blame it on the
[1:05:37] devil well maybe a little but let's
[1:05:39] blame it on herself like Caleb and
[1:05:42] Joshua came back with the evidence
[1:05:43] they'd been over in the promised land
[1:05:44] now those other believers he shouldn't
[1:05:46] mean unbelievers they said oh it's great
[1:05:48] but we can't do it
[1:05:51] but they hung along just the same
[1:05:53] remember those 10 spies that said we
[1:05:55] can't make it
[1:05:57] and then the two that said we could
[1:05:59] Joshua and Caleb they didn't they didn't
[1:06:02] separate
[1:06:03] Joshua and Caleb stayed right there with
[1:06:05] him for 40 years
[1:06:07] stayed with them and they walked like
[1:06:09] this and was right there at the promised
[1:06:10] land and they just kept walking like
[1:06:12] this
[1:06:13] but look they never got to enter the
[1:06:15] promised land except for those two just
[1:06:18] those who come back with faith that we
[1:06:20] could
[1:06:22] and then he talks about
[1:06:24] the amorites and all that well now God
[1:06:27] just didn't go over there and take a
[1:06:29] broom and sweep out Canaan and all the
[1:06:31] amorites hit dots and all them and sweep
[1:06:33] them out say come on in Israel this is
[1:06:35] yours we've even planted Crocs for you
[1:06:37] no sir they had to fight for every inch
[1:06:40] of ground in other words they had to
[1:06:41] fight their way in they had to fight
[1:06:43] their way to stay there
[1:06:44] but they had the promise of Victory how
[1:06:47] many we got to we've got to have that
[1:06:50] promise of victory
[1:06:52] if you're so beat down try please try to
[1:06:57] say I have the victory somewhere it
[1:07:00] might be a little one
[1:07:03] battle ain't gonna be one in one day
[1:07:06] a war
[1:07:09] look
[1:07:10] Footprints means possession
[1:07:13] every time the souls of your feet touch
[1:07:15] that's it take that much ground in other
[1:07:17] words a little bit a little bit more a
[1:07:19] little bit more let's do this and then
[1:07:21] we'll close
[1:07:22] brother mom said patience with heart
[1:07:24] what what kind of patience first thing
[1:07:25] is have patience with who not your
[1:07:27] neighbor not your brother not your
[1:07:28] pastor not your friend patience with God
[1:07:31] if you've got real genuine faith you'll
[1:07:33] have real genuine patience because Faith
[1:07:36] worketh patience When God says anything
[1:07:38] you believe it that's all you got
[1:07:40] patience you said well I asked him last
[1:07:42] night and I'm just as sick this morning
[1:07:44] oh my what patience in other words what
[1:07:46] are you working on that's what we were
[1:07:48] talking about last night somebody asked
[1:07:49] a question what's the difference in
[1:07:51] Divine Healing and the difference in a
[1:07:54] miracle
[1:07:55] a Divine Healing takes patience
[1:07:58] a miracle is something that a capture
[1:08:00] falls off or like the picture that's
[1:08:02] just free to send us to one picture this
[1:08:04] lady just eat up with cancer black spots
[1:08:06] all over him she was prayed for next
[1:08:09] time she went to have her X-ray done
[1:08:10] nothing there
[1:08:12] all right
[1:08:13] but now Divine Healing
[1:08:15] takes a while
[1:08:17] it tries your faith
[1:08:20] well I ain't no bet have patience
[1:08:23] what if Noah 10 years into his
[1:08:27] tenure as the pastor of
[1:08:30] whatever City he was in
[1:08:35] they tell him every day Nola they no
[1:08:37] rain
[1:08:39] and they're Whiting
[1:08:42] remember the Bible says the ground it
[1:08:43] come up from the ground the mess came up
[1:08:45] in other words the the aqueducts and the
[1:08:47] viaducts was pushing water up out of the
[1:08:48] ground there wasn't any reason for rain
[1:08:51] so he was preaching something totally
[1:08:53] totally away from science and totally
[1:08:57] away from anybody's perspective
[1:09:01] I promise you
[1:09:03] before Noah started preaching and during
[1:09:06] the time he started preaching
[1:09:09] nobody sold an umbrella
[1:09:14] right brother Carly umbrellas got
[1:09:16] created After the flood
[1:09:18] because they didn't need them before so
[1:09:20] that made it even more like I'm telling
[1:09:22] you today and some of you look at me
[1:09:23] cross-eyed somebody is not going to die
[1:09:28] somebody's going to need that umbrella
[1:09:31] somebody
[1:09:32] 's here before all that Eno didn't need
[1:09:35] one
[1:09:36] he walked was gone and he was not that's
[1:09:38] right because God took him but Noah had
[1:09:41] patience if he didn't come today it'll
[1:09:43] come tomorrow what if 10 years into this
[1:09:45] brother Dale would have said well I deal
[1:09:47] with these bunch of rebels no more
[1:09:50] where would we have been that would have
[1:09:52] been 1981. some of y'all wasn't even
[1:09:55] born
[1:09:56] what if he said fully I'm done with it
[1:09:58] close Church get out of here finish
[1:10:00] don't want no more of this bunch of
[1:10:02] rebels no he persevered
[1:10:04] he had patience
[1:10:06] knowing that what God would
[1:10:08] end his promise
[1:10:11] the end of the promise is is us going in
[1:10:13] the Rapture all right come on musicians
[1:10:15] why God said so
[1:10:18] and brother Louise was preaching several
[1:10:20] Wednesdays ago
[1:10:23] Wendy tell you that Noah
[1:10:30] Revelation that's a little over 100
[1:10:32] years old
[1:10:33] and we want fresh Revelation every day
[1:10:35] we want something to we want something
[1:10:37] to spark listen we need to hang on to
[1:10:40] what God's already got it for us what
[1:10:42] God's already give us we need to hang on
[1:10:44] to it we find God come this far waiting
[1:10:46] for the church too but it'll be there
[1:10:48] don't you worry he promised it let's
[1:10:50] stand to our feet
[1:10:55] they that wait upon the Lord
[1:10:57] shall renew their strength
[1:10:59] they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles
[1:11:02] they shall run and not be weary
[1:11:05] they shall walk and not faint
[1:11:07] Teach Me Lord
[1:11:09] Teach Me Lord
[1:11:11] to wait
[1:11:12] trouble over there is where people were
[1:11:14] in too much of a hurry
[1:11:15] it's just got to be done right now can't
[1:11:19] come back no more say and when you get
[1:11:21] that in your mind you're going to lose
[1:11:24] right there
[1:11:27] when you get that in your mind you're
[1:11:29] going to lose right there you're on
[1:11:32] losing ground right there you have
[1:11:36] nothing to stand on
[1:11:38] you must be patient
[1:11:41] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:11:42] their strength that's what I said God's
[1:11:45] in no hurry
[1:11:48] he let the Hebrew children
[1:11:51] get so close until they had to start
[1:11:53] feeling the heat because it killed the
[1:11:54] people that was beside of them
[1:11:56] that's how hot it was
[1:11:59] but you know what their testimony was
[1:12:00] we're not bowing to what you told us
[1:12:03] about too
[1:12:04] Satan we're not doing what you told us
[1:12:06] that we're supposed to do or or the
[1:12:07] government's got for us or this got for
[1:12:09] us and that's got for us we're not doing
[1:12:11] that we're going to die well if I die
[1:12:13] I'm gonna die happy I'm gonna die in the
[1:12:15] Lord but guess what happened
[1:12:18] it burned everybody else up but them
[1:12:21] it singed the ropes off of their hand
[1:12:25] s and when they come out and they didn't
[1:12:26] smell like they was even in a fire
[1:12:29] God didn't just keep them from the fire
[1:12:31] you talk about a body change
[1:12:34] how many of you have had Burns
[1:12:37] they hurt
[1:12:39] and blisters I've seen people burn all
[1:12:41] over their body and it's hideous
[1:12:45] it was seven times hotter they was
[1:12:46] walking in and the thing was glowing
[1:12:49] if you'd have just touched the outside
[1:12:51] of the Furnace you'd have died but they
[1:12:53] walked in it
[1:12:55] they walked in there
[1:12:57] we got trials and tribulations folks but
[1:12:59] we never had a trial like that before
[1:13:02] hey man we never were told that if you
[1:13:04] don't do what I tell you to do you're
[1:13:06] going into that fire pit
[1:13:08] but they did but they what they had
[1:13:10] Faith under the blood of bulls and
[1:13:12] ghosts they had that much faith
[1:13:14] because they come to a conclusion I'm
[1:13:16] not going to do I'm not going to bow
[1:13:20] we got to come to a conclusion today
[1:13:21] we're not going to bow
[1:13:23] to what the devil's got
[1:13:26] amen I'm not
[1:13:28] you should not bow
[1:13:29] we don't have to bow there's only one
[1:13:31] person we bow to
[1:13:33] and you know what he don't make us
[1:13:37] he don't make us
[1:13:40] but he loves it when we do
[1:13:42] when we Bow Down and Worship Him see
[1:13:44] don't be in a hurry wait and watch
[1:13:46] listen take the scriptures examine it
[1:13:49] see if it's right and if it's right hold
[1:13:52] on to it if it's not
[1:13:54] tell me so I can get it right
[1:13:57] that's what the prophet of God said
[1:13:58] right
[1:13:59] one more time be patient
[1:14:03] now we got that way we got to add it but
[1:14:05] if you ain't got it that way don't add
[1:14:06] it it won't work
[1:14:07] in other words we were talking about
[1:14:09] last night you know God shut the ark
[1:14:14] no it didn't Noah was still at the 120th
[1:14:17] day wanting a a crowd of people to just
[1:14:21] rush into the ark
[1:14:23] that's how much he believed of what he
[1:14:25] was preaching
[1:14:26] but God said I've had enough
[1:14:29] I'm going to close the door
[1:14:31] nobody else is getting in
[1:14:35] and then brother Brown tells us there's
[1:14:37] time when a gentile's door will close
[1:14:39] and I'm not going to close it and you're
[1:14:41] not going to close it
[1:14:43] God's going to close it
[1:14:44] and who's out there is out there and
[1:14:46] who's inside is inside that's what we're
[1:14:48] coming to it's not now I don't believe I
[1:14:50] believe we still got people coming in
[1:14:52] we're still preaching the gospel as if
[1:14:54] that is but there's going to come a time
[1:14:56] and a place with us that and listen
[1:14:58] that's our mandate in this
[1:14:59] Administration tells us there's going to
[1:15:01] be a day when the door is going to be
[1:15:03] closed and we can't open it for nothing
[1:15:06] nothing we can do
[1:15:08] but God said look God said it's going to
[1:15:10] rain and it rained and those who found a
[1:15:13] way of Escape took it
[1:15:15] those who didn't perished the same God
[1:15:18] that said it will rain set fire is going
[1:15:21] to fall from Heaven and destroy the
[1:15:23] world and there's a way prepared for you
[1:15:25] those who will take it will escape it
[1:15:28] those who do not will perish The Sinner
[1:15:31] will perish with a sinful world but the
[1:15:33] redeemed will be Redeemed by the Holy
[1:15:36] Spirit
