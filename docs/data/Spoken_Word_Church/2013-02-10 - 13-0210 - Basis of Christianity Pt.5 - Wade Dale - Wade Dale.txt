========================================

that one either let's go back review and read review and read chapter 18. all right okay what's the date 10. this is okay okay we're in now okay 18 verse four let's back up for a second the words of a man's mouth are as deep Waters that can be good or bad and the Wellspring of wisdom is a flowing Brook it's not good to accept the person of the wicked to overthrow the righteous in Judgment of Fool's lips enter into contention and his mouth calls for stroke a Fool's mouth is his destruction and his lips are the snare of his soul the words of a tail Bearer are his wounds and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly you know what a tail bear is Right paddle tail Busy Body somebody talks all the time about others all right so we got to quit that the Bible says our Whisperer the words of a Whisperer that's in the original all right verse nine he also let it slothful in his work his brother to him that is a great waster the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and it's safe the rich man's wealth is a strong City and is in high wall in his own conceit Before Destruction the heart of man is haughty and before honor is humility look at the difference look at that Before Destruction the heart of man is haunting and before honor is humility all right he's an actress of matter before he Hearth it it is finally in shame unto him in other words somebody that stands up and makes comment of something or or hearsay or whatever the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded Spirit who can who can bear The Heart Of The Prudent giveth knowledge and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge now verse 16. a man's gift maketh room for him same thing with you sisters too this is sisters and brothers and bringeth him before Great Men we see that a lot of times you know you want to do something for the Lord and if it's not your gift to do it's not going to prosper but if it is a gift that God gave you if it is something a man's gift maketh room for him in other words if you got a gift of of wisdom then God's going to make room for that gift of wisdom if it's of God right all right and same thing with preaching or teaching or anything else you just gotta know though like I I don't try to I don't try to make myself be an evangelist I'm not I'm just not just not my mold and that's not my gift my gift is teaching breaking things down and and getting people to understand things and trying to make it you know a little bit on the fun side so we don't get so mundane in our in our learning but that you have to make room for yourself okay that's what the problem I see with a lot of people in the message we've got a lot of bangers wanting to be pastors a lot of pastors want to be evangelist you can't do that you got to stand the gift that God gave you all right if you stand the gift God give you you know what he'll make you more successful than what you think you'd be doing something else all right and that's the same thing with anything we need to pray you know of course we all have desires and this is what I was thinking about we all have desires to do things yes but maybe that's just not the gift that God if God gives you a certain gift then take that gift and use it nurture it do something with that gift all right uh even your sisters if your gift is just to be a homemaker then guess what just be on a good one just be a good Homemaker all right if he wants you to do something and go out for the Lord and testify or whatever do it but a man's gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before Great Men he that is first in his own cause sameth judge but his neighbor cometh and searches him all right in other words your neighbor's gonna know what's going on by the fruits that you bear that's what we've been talking about that's what we're talking about now about our fruits and living me a sermon let's go to 19 a brother offended it's harder to be one than a strong City now look at that a brother offended verse 19 a brother offended you see that is harder to be one than in other words a walled City with and you've got 50 000 troops it's easier to take that City that wall city and fight your way through it than it is to offend a brother so let's think about that just food for thought a man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth in other words what's in there is going to come out not just the belly of your general your belly it's talking about the inner part of you and with the increase of his lips shall be filled death and life are in the power of the tongue brother Brown said you can kill somebody with your influence without physically killing them and it's worse than just physically killing them all right and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof so what's the fruit that that's going to Bear death and life death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof who shall findeth a wife find it's a good thing and obtains favor of the Lord you're not just going to make your wife happy and you happy you're going to make the Lord happy the poor uses and treaties but the rich and shrimp roughly all right so you have to kind of be careful you can watch the uh I was looking for a quote I got one on being somebody being flattered or flattering just be careful when you start flattering because uh you can Heap a lot of things on her head to see the rich and ruffling the poor uses in previous so you have to kind of watch sometimes it is if you're if you're rich in God it is it is okay to be a little sharp it is okay to be a little you know say hey this is the way it's got to be because we're sheep we got to be led so we have to be told things what to do right all right right and that's just the way it is all of us all right same way with us and you know say who so find that the wife finds a good thing I'm trying to favor the Lord don't think about that just as your spouse you're the wife of Jesus Christ so whoso if Christ finds us a good wife us the bride you'll obtain favor from the Lord but oh my goodness be careful if we do things wrong because we will be chasing all right a man that has friends verse 24 must show himself friendly remember what I said about Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln he said hey if we make our enemies our friends we've defeated our enemies that's what we need to start doing instead of instead of trying to put the person down just make them your friend and there is a brand that's stickers closer than a brother all right verse chapter 19 let's continue I want to get down to a point right here stop better is the poor that walketh in his integrity this is what we're talking about integrity see better is the poor that walketh in Integrity than he that is perverse in his left and is a fool our fruits are going to show what we are that's right and better is the poor that walketh in his integrity sometimes I'd rather have a poor man if he's pouring wealth right but have integrity have something you know something to show I've seen people like that but I've seen people that had millions of dollars that I didn't want to even listen to what they had to say right also that the soul be without knowledge it is not good he that hastes with his feet Senate he that hate in other words you'd go out you go out past the program of God brother Brown said you see him laying on the side of the road scrap heaps of ministers God has a program and how many times you've seen preachers I've seen preachers go go way out here go away from the program of God well you know what the steady ones is gonna The Tortoise and the hair all either went through because Dave Ramsey course you know who always wins that's why that being there like to read the book called in the end the turtle always wins that's right because the hair went out here and said oh I'm out here and I got all this great stuff and I'm this and this but that hair just I mean that tortoise just kept going day by day walking day by day now I think that's what God wants us to do we see a lot of things that that we want to try to manufacture well if we try to manufacture it I'll promise you one thing it'll fail that's right if we try to manufacture it it will fail that's why I'm just saying about the gifts God Will Make Room for a gift best thing for you to do is to be pliable enough instead of just say well this is what I'm going to do it's a lot different than saying I'm going to try this and see how the Lord you know see how the Lord feels about it because you know what he wants us to be successful but he wants us to be successful in what in what he wants us to do that's right okay not what not a lot of times what we want to do but what he wants us to do that's the same thing talking to your neighbor going to Walmart and I'm telling you I may be just real overboard on this but even walking down the aisles at Walmart if someone's laying in the floor I'll pick it up I may not put it back in the same place but I'll put it up somewhere to keep a kid from kicking it all at all the place and what in our parking lot the other day people throw down drink bottles and stuff pick them up I've seen people walk by them and kick them you know no pick a thing up make it make as you go through life make what's behind you better and if you do that you know what that's characteristics you say oh this is just this is just Mind Over Matter well maybe it is but I see in the scripture where where Solomon was a wise man he did what God told him to do right he was one of the wisest men in the world and he asked for wisdom and God gave him wisdom plus riches but if he would have asked for riches first he would have never got wisdom he might have got the riches but he never got the wisdom but he asked for wisdom first right right man then God said okay you've asked for wisdom and you've not asked for well I'm gonna go ahead and give you wealth too because by your wisdom you're going to be able to handle your wealth right that's what we're talking about in in the Dave Ramsey course and I agree 100 God's not going to give you something oh and then you mishandle it I said if God gives you something and you don't want you to miss handle it he wants you to do the right thing with it same way with money I don't believe some people have money because God knows you can't handle it but if you'll start doing the principles and say Hey I want the wisdom of how to do this then God will bring the things together and we can live a better comfortable more comfortable life what you're saying is it and it goes down to trivial stuff too because let me tell you what happened to me now what I do now is when you go in the supermarket and you get something and you get so far you say well I don't want it and you just put it in the place they're gonna but now I'm very conscious of it and it's it weighs on your mind where you have to man you have to go six or seven hours back you take it and put it back in the same spot right yeah what happened is okay what I did my son daughter said well Grandma I don't have to take this as an um we have to take it you don't want it we have to take it back and it grows on over into it absolutely that's what that's the little trivial stuff that you don't expect until you start thinking about I want to be like Christ right ain't going on and you say well that's trivial and I know from the past experience I get something I don't want that whatever but I always had and what they're gonna do is take it back later somebody's gonna take it back and they're gonna put it back in there somebody's gonna get it or whatever and you think about it last time we're missing it in the walk let's try to do our walk right to first if we do our walk right God has got listen God has got to honor that it's not like we're just living good be good people no God's Gonna honor that if you do something right God will honor that and if we're children of God he's going to honor us much more I believe I just believe he'll want to rest more than somebody just you know brother Brown said some of these virtues were were you know were not god-given but they were Natures out in the world of people that were Mickey Mouse well that's okay but how take that though and put god with it and see what you can do y'all don't know but your pastor every Sunday morning this is the messiest place for that long giveaway thing over there he picks a whole grounds every time he messenger right and you know what yeah it makes you look better and we got a better place to be and and you know what it's just like when the Bible says honor your father and mother that your days belong on the face of the Earth well that doesn't say Christians that just says honor your father and mother that your days will be long that's why a lot of young people I believe are dying at Young ages because they dishonor their parents yes you dishonor your parents then it's just Bible but we're trying to take Natural Things to be a natural brother Brown said if we're missing it in the walk let's try to walk first right then God's going to bring these things right but if you make if you make a wall where God can't get to you with these virtues that are god-given then you're stopping God I mean it's not it's not God stopping God wants to give everybody these virtues but we need to have these virtues working in our life and I'm afraid like sister Johnny I used to not do that but I feel condemned at laying something up true you know what I go back and do it now we'll put it back put the thing back up don't put the do this do you know toys and stuff now I really don't try to look for the same thing to hang it up on but I'll at least put it back in the toy department you know and stuff like that and they just make make the place better and you know what if it doesn't do anything it gets that little devil that says it says you should have put that back if you were who you think you are well you know what the best thing to do is go put it back and he ain't got something to worry about it I was just along the same line I was just saying along what you're saying about putting things but just little trivial things like that the times that I have not done it it's it's almost it's more than like the little devil it feels like it kills something for me right in my spirit right like something dies that's right then when you go to pray there it is one condemnation pops up so if we can get rid of that that's what I want us to do here all right you know I don't want us to say well this and this is deep stuff this is deeper than anything that that's going on because brother Brown freaks God hidden and revealed hidden and revealed in Simplicity before he started to seal so it's the simple it's the simple things we got to do and then that little devil hops on the other shoulder once you've picked it up and he said now that's that was a good thing to do that's right that's one word one more step into heaven you don't you don't do it right that works well you get a nod from God and that's what brother Ram walked through life he got a nod from God why because he did a wrestling if we start doing the right things we might get a nod from God every once in a while you know he might say hey good idea good thing to do that's great keep it up brother Joe yeah they cracked up a pallets and they have fellas everywhere instead of me going around I pick them up from the garbage can sure absolutely and you know what somebody sees that somebody sees that and and even in our job I've told I've tried to get it to these young people if you would just act a little bit different than the others they'll pray they'll make you assistant manager and most time they'll make you a manager yet because the assistant the manager is they're just there for a job if you would just if you just do that man just that one little bit so you have a hand up yes no you had your palm up yeah bus 19. could you expound to that one a brother offended it's harder to be one than a strong City don't don't offend a brother because it's very hard to win him back yes that's right it's harder to be one than a strong City an offended brother it's harder to be one than like I said you could amass an army and take over a city rather than a brother offended you know brother Brown told us and this is something we don't do if you think a brother's got all against you you don't you don't wait for him you gotta you're supposed to go you're supposed to go to him that's right you're not supposed to wait and say well if he's got something if he's got something against me he can just come tell me about it no the scripture says and the brother round teaches that we supposed to go to that person and say hey you got something against me because what you got to do is get it off your tip so hey you got something against me brother and if he says no see the net Heat's all up on him you're done it Heats all up on him if he says no I ain't got no problem but he really does have a problem so if you think somebody's got a problem why I'm saying undies and I'm not saying this because of sister Dale no yeah no I'm saying this because of a brother he's not coming to church because he got offended somebody made a fun of how he dresses so I thought people be very careful how you treat people don't make wire of some somebody because what hurts you may not hurt somebody else and we'll have somebody else I'm gonna hurt you and you know we're trying to bring him back but people be careful how you treat other people that's right yeah just something small like that somebody come to church hey that's a stumbling block you know what if you stumble and fall I don't care if the Block's Empire or this high if you stumble and fall it hurts whether you're stumble on a little one or just to remember I was just be quit going to church because his life was better than it was a stumbling sure it was a stumbling block that's what it was he saw those deacons That was supposed to be exemplary deacons and this was in the 60s and he's all there everyday life was not good so that was a stumbling block that handled somebody so I agree with with um we say things in Jess sometimes but sometimes you know maybe let's hone this thing down to where we you know we don't have to be we don't have to walk in and be like zombies and just sit here you know and no you can use your personality but try not to use your personality in a hurtful way even though you might not think it's hurtful you know just hey if it's somebody brother wants to dress in a well I have a problem with the pink shirt and a pink tie all the time but let's do something else but you know if if they dress different so what as long as they're within the I mean your sisters look at the color difference look at the color difference of the of the what you wear mom likes flowers some others don't well just because she like flowers doesn't make her the devil and you God you know that's just human nature that's just human things that's just human but don't go off it's nice to tell somebody else unless it's provocative or unless it's not within the line of the of the message in the hour yeah but yeah right yeah these shirts and purple pants is okay well actually this brother was he just needs to get him a purple dress purple and pink tie to go with him he's over dressed it's not like he wore weird colors oh I did drinks and somebody and he spelled well if I dress up to go somewhere I should dress up to go to the house of God brother Brown said wear your best for Sunday wear your best now you don't have to look but I'm not hearing jeans and a t-shirt right I wear jeans on Wednesday night but you know what brother they'll see quit doing it I quit doing it if he's comfortable with it then I'm comfortable with it because he wears jeans he worse crops one night on Wednesday night you know his toes wasn't showing yeah I don't talk but see we get we get into that but but if we're within the light of the message of the hour so what big deal I don't care doesn't matter to me I don't you know we got some preachers in the message and we'll stop right here because I want to get to a point and we'll finish in a few minutes we got some people in the message some preachers in the message are Pastors in the message they don't let their sisters wear it won't does not want them to wear up they want them long if I want a big deal I mean he makes that a Doctrine in his church that his sisters have to wear their hand their hair like sister Gwen not like sister Jim to me there's no difference the only problem I ever got with it is if your hair is like assistant wins or anybody that wears as long you go in there and start working with food please put your hair up at least do something with it braid it Danny because it doesn't bother me though I'd rather have a hair this long in my food than one this long if you understand I'd rather have one have one from up here I had one stuck around the button the other day and I kept pulling that thing and pulling that thing and it was way down here that's okay I've seen that's just that's just that's not a doctoral issue though you don't say well sister you're going to hell because you wear your hair down like that's Gwen over here but but I do believe in being modest I do believe in the Bible says wearing modest apparel everywhere you go that's like Danny said one time he said you know you you dress up you go to church and you dress up you go to town you dress up you go to work and then your husband sees you and amen and a uh nightgown how many housecoat and fuzzy slippers all the time I don't agree with that I just don't see that do I I don't either thank you mother Danny but listen the whole thing of this we laugh about if we want to but we have to live an exemplary life if our life is as common as a world out here and and you can't tell the difference between me in my walk and my talk if you if you walk with me brother I said I walk in a man's office and tell him tell what what his desires are right okay so if you so then it must have something to do with your environment right that you create that you create whether you have you know music on that shouldn't be I know we work in some of you working offices where you can't control the music that's okay you just tune that stuff out but if you're in control of a situation and that's what you feed on then I would be I go to the altar I try to get rid of that thing same way with your clothes and same way with you know all of our we should be where everybody should know that we're Christians that we're different not even just like a nominal Christian I mean but we've got to be above that nominal Christian because a nominal Christian just knows what they know and that's it and that's basic even talking about what we're talking about now a nominal Christian wouldn't wouldn't even listen to you because about our hair and our dress and stuff like that because they don't deal with that stuff but that's why that brother Brown had to come and preach that to get a start toward the area of lining up and so that that when we walk through the you know through the Walmart or through work through the world they say man that's different or even like brother Joe see brother Joe nobody is probably ever sees that but that thing's on a video camera somewhere maybe and the head boss you never know and the head boss sees him throw that away on a security camera that's a wonderful man well if there is a situation comes up that maybe brother Joe let's just say he runs into one of the light poles out in the parking lot and it bends it over the guy's going to be a lot more lenient on brother Joe because of the things that he does because we're humans we make mistakes that's a human mistake but in light of but now if he would see brother Joe on a camera he don't smoke but now I'm throwing a cigarette butt down or drinking coffee and throwing the cup down he would ask that company never to come back his right well see bro Joe would then either lose his job or the company would lose something everything's connected people everything is connected whether you do this or everything is connected and if you do if you are in a worker day world with as many cameras that are out now you better do things right and you know what no it's on it's on it's a witness camera it's a witness right and like I said brother Joe you do or anybody you do something wrong an employer or a customer or a vendor is going to be much more settled hey it's just a human mistake but if he sees bro Joe just kick that pilot out of the way or throw down a coffee cup or he may kick him out but if you see him do the right thing he said hey this is your human being he's trying to do a good job he's just making a mistake and that's what I want us to uh you know we we got the message of the hour we've got all the quotes we got everything we need but if the brother around says we're missing and missing it in the walk that's right and we're missing it missing it and leave us a sermon then that's what we need to start working on I mean if we but if we do get that then that's a good foundation that's right there Faith Foundation don't forget your foundation let's work on putting all these other virtues and letting them do this with God instead of just having human nature virtues to do right there are people that do right just by human nature they're just they just do right maybe they were brought up right but if you take that though and you can take somebody that's brought up wrong take the new birth it's got to go back to right it's got to go back to right so if we take that and put them two together and I think that's what God wants us to do he wants us to walk as a human but walk is a Godly human because you can be you can be you can be a Godly human and a human at the same time because you got God in you and in what God projects from here like we read the belly out of the belly flows right rivers and water whether it's good or bad everything proceedeth out of the mountain so keep those things in mind we'll talk about a little bit more next couple of Sundays and then we'll start on statue of a perfect man thank you brother Tom Ernest he'll be here on Wednesday night with us goodbye yeah we got something guys this afternoon he'll do Jeff is fine
