TRANSCRIPT
========================================
okay we're recording now okay speaks truth we are wrong all right we're all know Lilly Zooey's will be here in a minute oh are you just running behind i'll be here man period so while staying with the chickens until the head brewster gets here okay so uh the boys gone too with sterling and em up to Indiana let me to distraction good ok now for those of you any I'll have this out I know Rebecca's got the app on your those of you that are there applied applied savvy so that's what that mean it's an application or play is a nap and it's the table and this is all the quotes you can pull up I'll get put in 70th and they give me 31 results so there's 31 times a brother round said the word 70th okay so we're just going to pick that one today we read some of them last week and go read them again this week because they're important and and as we were talking before the contention in the message in contention means one contend one way one contends another way the desert treat ok you can contend them but this is this this dip with this one treat my brother Dale Toma there's only one tree that's one true thank God God can't give you an untruth he has to give you the availability to get true and then you have to run it through your filter that's the problem some people run it through their natural filter and get a different interpretation than what the Prophet said but the contention in the message is since we've been through all this and we have the church know one thing for sure there's one we left have direction according to the Bible I say that first according to the Bible and the prophets message there's one week left after the rapture that 70th week will be right here after the rapture takes place go fulfill scripture all the way three we've proven it all the way I don't think we have to prove it anymore all right but let's go to the quotes because what they're saying is they say that brother Branham talk Daniel seventy weeks in 1961 one way and then when the seals broke he taught it another way and in 1961 he was basically wrong you'll never get most of the admitted but those that have left the message those that have left and said brother Branham was wrong false prophet or whatever the ones that have left the two things that they Kim well three actually number one is the cloud they say he wasn't out there they say this wouldn't happen they say that didn't happen number two damn 70 weeds he made so many mistakes he was wrongly wrong the wrong and in 1977 that's the three things that you'll go on to believe the sign or any of those websites that are those sites that are wrong thats a brother around was wrong and they're trying to get the people out of the message now yes it brother ground was so wrong in these areas okay well my my contention is is that if the people in the message in the message that are saying that they that he was right but yet they come along and say well done brother I'm changes doctrine from one week left after the rapture to only three and a half years left after record alright but now this quote to me if this globe versus what we're teaching versus what they say is true then brother Ram was the most confused man that ever lived that we're supposed to listen to I said that we're supposed to listen to that rat dream faith delays in these books and take this way man ok so it can't be an opinion are or we can't decide what the brother ground was wrong now bro Brad was wrong when he preached a white horse rider was the Holy Ghost he himself God corrected him during the seal ok but you'll never hear him say that God corrected him on Daniel seventy weeks it was always you misunderstood what I said and will read that later on but now their contention is is that he showed one week left now my whole problem with this thing is he preached three sermons I'm day in 70 wheels if one part of this is wrong it's all wrong right he preached it right out of the Bible took it right out of the history and I believe when he said in this book is the same thing he said in the sealed there's just a revelation there that we must have that shows that he was right continually all the way through so their contention is is that brother branham preached this what we're going to read a minute from Daniel seventy weeks that there's one we left after the rapture and then in the seals he changed it as only three and a half years left all right now but now I wanted I found this quote from 1957 questions and answers all right and it's the video can show that she's shown and also this is questions and answers don't look at Hebrews now watch it was given by Lord Jesus on Matthew in Matthew 24 that the Jews would be taken out of patron what's he talking about Matthew 24 they would be taken out we would be grafted in and then they would be put back in like Ryan Ryan was asking me a question about the Jews and about Israel about God God was married to Israel in the Old Testament that was his first bride preach that years and years here if you there's a series called Israel and the church it's in a book form almost like this one there's like several sermons that is a real good book to read to understand how God treated Israel he was married to her he had the divorce her it even says in the Bible I am married to thee alright but he put her away because she went for and after other gods and he picks up the wild olive branch on the Gentile bride and brings us in but he never will forget Israel that's why the damn Stephanie weeks come in so beautiful God doesn't forget them in the land you've got to keep the land involved remember what we were preaching less windy you've got to bring you the land God said land the land must rest what's this on the land that temple that temple that city is the holy city that's just the holy city cause nothing to do away with all right now excuse me dan said it back over in the old prophets he said would be seventy weeks of weeks yet allotted to the Jews no watch was what he said and the Messiah would come the press and would prophesy in the midst of the 70th weeks watching which was the seven years there's your key Jesus prophesied three and a half years here he prophesied three and a half years here he was cut off in the middle of that week he's talking about now I want to show you something you brother Bob did real quick this to me this blouse in it for a long time but really this something visual that you need to see and it's really wonderful i'm trying to get Bob to you know put it on chart don't worry about my be keeping stuff your chart and I watch look because look if brother branham was if he said the devil straight up we're going to read it meant that this tree and a half years left of the Jews in 1957 then he says there's one week left in 1961 then he changes it back to three and a half years in 1963 he is very confused man when she's not you're just not getting what he said watch right here I like it when we can do this all right right here one week of Jesus's ministry not the 70th week but brother Brown condenses all of Daniel 70 weeks into one week three and a half years of Jesus's ministry here three and a half years of Jesus's ministry here thank y'all for Gentile correct I want to show you that look a little bit a little bit closer I agree with this and he's done a lot he's added a lot of things he'd even put a white horse rider red or black belt and he's just totally correct in all this and I will give power to my two witnesses they said prophesied mallu to him threescore that's revelation 11 3 1830 and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off enough himself he's cut off right here all right okay if I got that we gonna put this chart up but but watch how he even puts in here and tending the passages with baptized and praying the hill was open Luke 321 he's got the water there that's kind of cute 26 ad and he died 38 days so he was 29 and a half years old in Luke 3 which was in October it's when he started his ministry making it three and a half years all right so everybody got that okay I see it on I think see it on there too but this is what they're missing in the message brother branham is speaking of because look there is nowhere in the Bible that it said Jesus was coughing to mr. we find it there's only one scripture Daniel 9 27 that says he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and break the code in the middle week and that he is not he that he's the Antichrist but brother branham is bringing us a revelation that we're not understanding that the three and a half years of Jesus's ministry is here and see the contingent of the people the messages see they tear up everything brother drowned said they're saying that you got squeezed this over this way but the last half of the 70th week here and put the first half of the 70th week over there according to the Bible that can happen the program cannot break scripture listen people then then preachers they've been in a message for thirty and forty years we're drawing their own charts bringing out their own script to the brother baile never used they were you know why said before somebody asked me said have you ever seen a bunch of people so confused I said well it's kinda like you know how he died yesterday he was the greatest but I can who was it Frasier Frasier meet him right right they boxing away at all of a sudden boom somebody who I'm supposed to be shoes my old hits you and you fall down what are you gonna do you're gonna come up fight with you man and that's what happened to those ministers in the men's room now we put it on the internet because I really don't care they were fighting and grabbing at straws because they couldn't they couldn't tell me why this was wrong and everything else is right so I'm saying you saying this is wrong are you any more than the people that saying that brother outgrown here they leave the message I contend that he's right all the way through the man so brother branham is telling us about this mesial ministry now I work brother Claude unit Son of Man ministry because this is a ministry of the Son of Man right this is the minister the Son of Man God would be in human flesh and HP problems ok so now he has cut off in the midst of that ministry week not the 70th week according to the Bible this has to be to fulfill the six full purpose and we're going to go back to it next Sunday alright we're going to go through the six full purpose there's no way you can squeeze that whole six whole purpose in here because if you stop Daniel seventy weeks right here you got to put an everlasting righteousness and building a temple here and then you got the Battle of Armageddon that's going to destroy everything just one of the main you start grabbing at straws you know what they start doing start close quote for well now show me this is what brother been seen in 1957 the Messiah was cut off into mr. Lee what week now this week the Messiah week that Messiah ministry the Son of Man ministry was seven years brother round always condenses all right the real killer that because I want to try to get it goes look he's got all kind of things in him which is wonderful all the way down here capstone message coming at the end coming right here see that touchstone message shop Boyz trumpet he did a really good job all right just be well I can't print it over here do after pulling up yeah yes we are that's what we're gonna do I just was trying to do it on here I'm good all right so anyway we'll run that off and he's got all the kingdoms and these guys ahead of gold and all the way down to here so and then right here he's proving just to get will follow slap on the back the time line up why Jesus died in a t30 and he was 33 year ago he showed this to actually be pointing four weeks into go go all the way through and show you you here okay cut brother Fredo many brains in the quote brother Brown said now inside I wrote in the city Jerusalem trap on the Bible wat new Palm Sunday hey cool second 8030 maturities laughing my man home Hank alright so now you got 483 years to here and one week left our seven year they're selling here as well yeah come right in hey mamas nobody dude I'm always growing spiritually and where I'm going we're lucky she goes okay okay well you just put together what we've been talking about John an individual pictures for no watch now watch what brother Brown says watch what he says here in 1957 before 61 the Messiah would come the press and we prophesied and would prophesied in the midst of the 70th week which was the seven years now if you take that literally according to the Bible you're going to have to put Jesus prophesied right there in the middle of the 70th week if you take it as exactly what we're talking about the lord mercy that's the bell are again no no right but he was cut off in a mix of that seven-year message because well three and a half years let's just let's just real plane three and a half years the Jews rejected him we accepted him our Redemption comes from that message change of the body and everything now then we're going in a rapture and he's coming back to fulfil revelations 11 3 the last three and a half years of his ministry because the Jews rejected that one they're going to see their my side at the end of this one okay because you're going to rip we're going to read maybe next Sunday where the question was asked about the 70th week all right so if I got it all right we need more run that off come out where but like Bob said you gotta get a paper this big to really get big enough Claude or something you know what can we send it to this to print just get them to Princeton big big bear looking stuff okay okay which was the seven years so brother branham takes the seventy weeks of Daniel and compresses it to seven years because truly all this the 49 years of building the Temple the four in 34 years coming up to Jesus what we talked about last night about thing and all this is kind of the event date but it's proven that God's telling them what to do in that's right bro but really the truth of the matter is the seventy weeks of Daniel is the redemption of Israel and the city we are injected in the middle of all that to get that first three and a half your message for our redemption so that that seven-year ministry which is not it's not really seven it's the same green i have over again you know it just it breached seven years he preached three and a half we got that part the Jews rejected it then we come up and get this part of going to wrap trend in the same trend have your message goes for the Jews but according to revelations 11-1 they get 1260 days of that message Christ comes back into profits and preachers to them and they improve to them that the Messiah has already come okay so that's how brother Graham is condensing it which was the seven years that part that Bob brought up the yellow part you see that I tried to explain that to mess with me but they sure we're brother I'm say that what's he saying it now so anyway you even people really proud he'd be cut off in the mix look how perfect what Jesus was exactly preach three and a half years was crucified but there is that come right in on this other question here there's three and a half years yet log into them to the Jews it's got to be so it is just three and a half years of Jesus's ministry left but you can't break the Bible the Bible says there's one week left after that print signs of Covenant and we're not here when that Sun if I got that so now I wrote around them is though saying this and then let's go to hear let me did last Sunday this is in the seventy weeks of Daniel Gables instruction watch revelation 6 1 Revelation 19 21 is connected with the 70 weeks of weeks therefore we want stop and explain before we go further with my stop and explain why these 70 of weeks because if you don't you'll miss the seals you mr. trumpets how do we work place and every bit of this in here okay because we know one thing for sure the sixth seal opens literally through those two prophets during this ministry right here okay and all trumpets sound under the sixth seal what is the seventh trumpet the kingdoms of our Lord have become the kingdom are the kingdom of this world have become the kingdom of luring I cry that is the seventh seal programs to the seller sell to us as the same as a civic trumpet to them what's going to happen fall trumpet sound under the sixth seal which is known to prophets the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdom what what's going to happen once that bad well we're getting over the kingdom of God is coming in right to be established you'll miss those trumpets so we can place the trumpets right see that's another thing they say the feast of trouble around made many mistakes he did not make any was that you'll miss the louse plays three unclean spirits like problems three rows we know the third or will be the third whoa casting out of the red dragon right here one inside remember the woman she's carried away for how long three and a half years protected you'll miss it all if you don't because it takes place right here in this 70th week now he's in this week's right here all right because we're not here we don't get this message we've already got our message you take place right here according to the Bible in the prophets message there's one more week left after the retro okay now let's go to the 6-foot purpose I'm telling you this Expo purpose if you'll read it is the full purpose will explain to you the 70th week so Israel did wrong to God and end this 70th week what's going to happen I'm going to finish the transgression of Israel read that keep going this is still in the six volt purpose and this don't see that and this 70th year of Daniel heey corrects itself eminent we'd rather coming to make an end of Sam put it away what's the first finish trend right in this 70th week alright here's another one this is paragraph 109 right what is the end time the end of the seventh week when that prints out of Christ shall be revealed at this time making himself God all right know what keep going you going in the middle of this 70th week all right this is still Emma 6 full partners anything gotta save it in wait all right let's go back up there how will it be we say this to you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain think that's lonely was your library manually coming Lord so now hinder or prevent those routes or sleep with a trumpet of God you found the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air will be called away in a moment in 2009 during that time that ends the church a now what is it going where's the what every church a go ahead right that has the church a church ages or Gentile right Jude as a nation then down here on earth God starts dealing with the Jews they'll be two prophets the eleventh chapter will pick that up two anointed prophets like a lot of Moses who I think it is and they'll bring curses after they saying that them consolidated in Rome have broke its covenant that print and in the middle of this 70th week what's the middle been that it will break it's coming up with Rome a Rome will break it with Israel and that caused the abomination to begin the scatter now Armageddon remember we talked about that right remember the abomination he's going to walk in bleep where we're showing that he's going to walk in and Passover on listen of the three and a half years and he's going to desecrate the temple the Jews can't do any more sacrifices 144,000 streaming you don't need it let's get out of here all right go up watch sorry and there will be a great flood when the Gentile remnant sleeping burden now the sleeping burden is going to be what killed right here right the dragon realms bird water out of his mouth to make war with the realm of the woman see to keep the commandments and dog Rome will do that a confederation of church will consolidate them together and bring the Jews into this Confederation and bring them back to their own temple worship again into the said Gloria they'll have me own turf nice on my right here when they made the tree when they make the tree all right now watch but watch right here but they have not their temple worship yet and when they establish the temple worship the church will be gone right here so he shall make a covenant with many for one week and in the midst of that week he the Roman prince will what break that covenant that's follow your brother around can't say anything that the bible does like a man Rome will break it in the middle of the 70th year three and a half years he'll break that covenant with them and cause the abomination make it that's what to spread to the consummation then he will take constant Jews and persecute them so that's going to happen right in here all right because I was thinking the other day you don't don't take this is it's just something on throw out there the Bible says they'll process time for 1260 days and then after that after that they'll be hunted down and killed so right here for 1260 day ministry there might be a little left over time in here remember they'll promise on 1260 days and when all 144,000 is sealed they don't know I'm going to come in what the food products right at the end of that could do is for just a few days they can just start bringing all kind of firing because the Bible says whatever comes out of their mouth they open that 60 or they can do anything with nature they want to call the earthquakes called all these things going and then they're going to be killed comes remember who you got to come in in the middle that week and break the Covenant so it's absolutely 1260 days so there's a little lap over time in a long time still to go all right the what I like this one right here what a great God is what a merciful Father friends let me say as your pastor you don't realize the privileges that you're living under you don't realize there's many great men nice great Saint thousands of holy men that died in years gone by Spirit fill man who would have loved to sing this day that we're living in lets you and I take advantage of all right let's continue the street full purpose that was the same quote we had Roma break it in the middle of the 70th year three and a half years okay if I got that now we're going to the 70th week of Daniel 70th week means that whatever you want the next the quote behind that little spread what is the straining the middle there right under 70th you'll break the covenant with Chris Brander come that's what the Bible says the abomination of a successor and it was preying on way to conservation conservation of the 70th week the desolation I thought of my all the people that right you read that yeah it's been there for about six weeks desolation there's your desolation are there that's what I said you've got wrong then you've got Israel for three and a half years you're not going to hear much about Roman is we're well maybe a little bit about Rome but not much about Israel there's going to be a time of peace they're gonna have their pen worship they got they want they've been wanting for 2,000 years they got their worship but there's two prophets it's going to come out and say come out of her my people that's why that's in Revelation between 61 and 19 come out of her my people and being on protective of her plagues what wrong come out of her then when he desecrates that temple 144 pounds going to leave the key problems are going to lead interactor and then there is your abomination to make it desolation he comes in and he's the abomination he is going to make that temple desolate and other words that you can't go in there you can't go in that temple and it's going to spread it to the consummation what about of Armageddon this out a World War not just Israel and there's a late Friday night Israel find the whole world and like I said they have the sense in the faith when they see the day I'm gonna make it you ain't gonna make it even remembers what's a swim did something said take my life today Lord but a bang in other words in my damn he killed more he killed 3000th listings in his death they had killed the whole time he was alive so they have that Sampson effect where they pushed the wall down hey its roof they're proud people they were smart to they'll call fire out of heaven and everything else you just wait it's a lot of that land ahead okay everybody got there so the abomination to make investment the Pope will walk into the temple and make that temple of desolate so yeah that's going to make somebody mad the Jews are sitting there they're saying the Messiah's coming we're going to make the sacrifices they got 144,000 and to prophets over here that are telling them they that temple worship is not yet right temple worship is not it the Messiah already come you're trying to kill him again you know through the sacrifices you've already killed in one time realize that I come to the damn automa because the day of coma is when they separate cry where'd you get those scars and house of my friends alright that's the day of atonement the dama told me you afflict your soul not that you're killing Jesus again you're reflecting your soul realizing you're centering your loss okay if I got that so when he comes in he then all of a sudden for three and a half years they're in they're doing what they're doing and then all of a sudden the Pope waltz into that Holy of Holies because God's not fair people I was not in that whole Ebola he left that holy of holiness hey man that's why the anointing to the temple that's going to be built here is going to be people it's not going to be a cloud and smoke and fire on tonight sighs all right it's us where they're going to the temple because in order here's the Holy Ghost we know the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will come into the temple okay if I got there but what what about if a man walks right into that holy holy one day throws the curtain back and there's a high priest with the blood he's doing what he's supposed to do and he turns around and there stands a Roman Catholic hope I Gentile and he walks in and says there'll be no more of that I'm your God I'm the one you've been waiting on I'm your guy you'll see they'll never use that temple again so the abomination makes desolate that temple will become desolate until they build here in the Millennium this is just a beautiful picture once you see it all come together but if you've got questions like 300 73 an avid sailor it's both there's three and a half years of Jesus's ministry level but there is one week left according to the Bible according to the prophets message and according to all these things that we think that's one we left after the rapture to finish the seventy weeks of Daniel all right right okay because you got you'll have to read that when we get into the next part we're going to get a few more we never can get past this we're not yeah thing all right brother though he's caught my brother handle this continue this great message that we're endeavoring to explain this 70th week of day now he's went from Gabriel's instructions to Daniel to a six whole purpose now he's explaining he has explained the 70th week so this last sermon is not just 70 weeks in anal it's showing the 70th week see what that says this now I didn't write that I didn't ever get that in there okay voice of God made it the 70th week if you want to say anything but that I'm sure brother Ram told on me i'm sure it's um I wrote down Stephanie we can bang so it's not to say when you win tonight it's the 73 my trust whinnies to explain this 70th week of damn then so many people are gathered and all that all right now watch he can't scroll down all right now my Pentecostal brother now Joe who wins brother be realized do you know with 144,000 here do you know for all the great miracles of Revelations appear over in the Jewish days nine hours they gets a literal happening we get the spiritual part right there is nothing recorded in it just the church getting ready and going out sure with the power of God we do miracles in that point we know that but the real thing with over here to the Jew I mean the real working power miracle-working 144,000 don't appear there they're over they appear not in the third chapter what is the third chapter revelation nice 13 revelations three is us the turkey okay that's my brother I'm said revelation 6 12 relations and a penis to the Jews we go up and 41 bob is a scene of redemption 61 is the opening sealed and all thanks to the Jews they appeared on the third chapter there on over in the scripture further listen to 11 this with 144,000 come in and now we see that all this stuff was to take place was over in this time of the 70th week the last half of the week Oh buddy son oh this is the last week that's what seven years okay now they've already had 69 weeks oh boy and lived it exactly the way God said they would sounds like a preacher make a mistake don't think so it happened exactly the way God said it would do then there's one more week promise to the two if I alright with that now that he asks them I understand up at this point that it's perfectly the truth it's the Bible it's the prophetic year sounds like a Maddux confused huh I didn't think something all right ok let's take now one stop right here just moments playing this one day rejected them aside was when they of course rejecting Jesus suceder and crucified that's when he was cut off Isaiah 53 said his generation was cut off to talk through the Bible remember hear what the Bible said that he shall be cut off but not from Selma sided print I think I approached close that prophecy hit right don't remember he said April the second 8030 he just rode into Jerusalem on white dong kyun in five days later he was crucified on Friday right so look how perfect that if that prophecy here exactly to the day exactly to the time and exactly the way it said it would this other seven this 17 weeks left 17 years rather seven days seven year will hit exactly according to the sound like a confused man right now remember he was cut off God sees to deal with them they did not go any further they were scattered by the Roman Empire that was in AD 70 remember the temple was destroyed Jesus told so there won't be one stone left on another that's why they're trying to build a temple by can we prove that Rome has all the menorah and they have a Holy of Holies and I got everything that the Jews need put temple worship back alright you notice here where I got the cross if you look on the chart you see that crosses ad 30 there's where they rejected but the time extended out just a little bit further to 70 years those tightest her own general destroyed Israel forty years later what if Jesus was healed maybe 30 was 40 plus 30 AE 70 40 years Roman to destroy Israel Jerusalem scatter the people Titus 40 years later alright then he only dealt with them until they rejected cry so we know they sent here they cried let his blood be on us and our children and it's been ever since all right got it when the devil in the Jews will keep going to hang out now watch next time on searching sleeping through every one of these ages waiting and we which are alive a little remaining bunch over here remaining alive until the coming of the Lord when I hinder those with your sleep for the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise I'd be literate come but I be right a painter hit it yeah I think that's it yeah cuz he upheld the coming of the Lord will not enter those which are sleep for the trumpet Adagio sound the dead in Christ shall rise first and we will be caught up together with them a man with them here we are meeting right here I'm sure he's marking it right on this chart brie shows the rapture on his chart right hands he said right there after that stone that's the rapture now look where did the Maasai get caught exactly where the word said where will that seven if we begin exactly after this church is cut off then God returns to the Jews when will that 70th week begin exactly after this church is cut off hmm right ok now let's read one morning we'll go then we'll stop with starla national next next week now you protestant say well now that's it just a moment we find out that the Protestants has an organization makes a confederation of churches and image to the Beast and go right with them and we find out here that the Jews are called in on this Confederation yes sir and they agree and the Bible said they did and he makes a covenant with them you home Daniel 9 27 in the midst of the 70th week he Brett the Antichrist brings his covenant with the Jew by people 1c in revelation 11 i'll send they're coming on over here toward 19 he will send His two prophets know prophesied that time and they'll get angry with these prophets and actually kill them dead body shell and spiritual streets called Sodom in tomorrow which are warm food fight Jerusalem that right they lay there for three days and nights
