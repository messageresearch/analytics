========================================

we're going to keep going through the book of hebrews here if the brothers could go ahead and pull that up and uh i was i was listening to sirs uh uh would you see jesus um sir sir we would see jesus and brother brown was talking about how if the brothers should go ahead and pull that slide up how the bible is kind of written in uh in a way that if we we read the the way that it's written now and the kind of that king's english that's kind of difficult to read and difficult to understand almost but he said in the in in that sermon he was breaking down about how that the way it was originally written was was like street language it's supposed to be real real simple for us to understand and um maybe um maybe this morning we can make things a little bit simpler before we get into this let's just let's just pray real quick well god we just asked lord that you'll just open up the word lord as we as we kind of study some some deeper things out this morning lord did you just be with us and be with brother wade that back there studying and just bless him and help him lord and give him strength we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen so um we got down to around about uh we we read the last time we we got through down to about verse 12 i think so we're on verse 13 which is a little bit weighty so let's just kind of catch up a little bit to set the context of where we were in verse 7 says and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers of flame of fire but unto the son he saith thy throne o god is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god even thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellas and you'll remember the last time just to kind of recap a little bit we we kind of recapped how the angels uh how paul was kind of bringing that down to the ministering spirits minister sent to bring the word to the people but but god under the sun he saith thy throne so the son has got a throne and his scepter is righteousness and because he loved righteousness and hated iniquity he he's been anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows and we kind of dove into the difference between righteousness and iniquity a little bit and compare those two and if you kind of you know i like to just kind of run things down through the scriptures if you kind of get in your mind what what iniquity is and and how iniquity is that crookedness getting off the word something something down if you if you can get in your mind what the iniquity is and then how to get rid of iniquity the righteousness of the word is what will get rid of iniquity and bring that all over into the first seal where brother brandon began to talk about how the mixture of iniquity already works and what iniquity is and think about as you begin to just get to go back and study the scripture because we are studying church we we rock we like to study so when you study study things out think think about that maybe when you go back and listen to the to the first seal again think about what it takes to get rid of iniquity and what brother brown is really speaking of there and in verse 10 and thou lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands thou they shall perish but thou remainest and they shall all wax old as death of garment and as a vesture shall thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail and you can see as the earth changes and and people change and they get older and they get wrinkles and things but yet god remains the same and i think that's a confidence that we can have this morning that he's the same yesterday today and forever the same way that they approached him in the old testament we can approach him the same way and get the same results because he's the same god and he never changes and then here we are at the end of almost the end of hebrews 13 hebrews chapter 1 verses 13 and 14 and verse 13 is really weighty so let's dive into that a little bit this morning it's it's kind of getting into some deep water and it says but to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make thine enemies that footstool and this is something that david quoted in psalms 110 psalms chapter 110 and again that peter quoted on the day of pentecost why would they why would peter quote this scripture on the day of pentecost to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make down enemies that footstool so paul's he's conveying a lot of imagery in here somebody's god is sitting down somewhere and he's got a footstool and he's here you know he's uh he's he's at a place where he can sit somewhere until something happens and so let's dive into that let's go to the next slide now now this kind of echoes hebrews at the beginning of this chapter paul said who bring the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high so he sat down somewhere so the question this morning is where did he see it where did he sit because if you can find where he's set then you can begin to you can begin to see the pattern of what's happened what's taking place in daniel 70 weeks and the seals and what brother rounds really talking about in the seals and things begin to open up if you can kind of begin to get to get the picture of where did he see it where did he sit what does the right hand of his power mean what does it mean to to have a footstool until all of his enemies are conquered what does that mean all the enemies all all of the all until every enemy so let's go to the next strong the next uh the next slide questions and answers law having a shadow brother ram said and i'm just going to read read you what brother brown said about it he said what did the prophets all say jesus would do when he come rule the nations with a rod of iron is that right they failed to see his first coming to the gentile so all the prophets said he was going to come to rule the nations with a rod about in other words sit on the throne and that's what the jews were looking for that when he would come he would see he would sit on his throne and rule the king he would have a kingdom and and so they were looking for it but then there's there's something has has to take place in between that in between him actually sitting on his millennial throne and ruling over the earth and and and so forth there's got there's got to be something else take place in between there and that's what the jews missed when they were looking for is looking for is coming he said they failed to see his first coming to the gentiles when he returns then he does rule all nations he will come he isn't up on his now here's the key he isn't up on his throne now he's sitting on god's throne so that's where he's sitting he's sitting on god's throne now if we can find out where god's throne is then we're getting somewhere so he's not sitting on his throne yet what was his throne his throne is going to be his throne his work where he actually comes back in his flesh and sits in the millennial kingdom and he reigns for a thousand years and he's actually there back in his body again sitting on his throne back it back raining again but for now he's setting on god's throne he that overcomes and brother ram quotes the scripture he that overcomes shall sit with me on my throne as i have overcome and set on my father's strong now he's wanting to come back and and who where is his earthly throne he says the throne of david god said he'd give him the throne of david in the millennium he'll sit on david's throne and we'll see him the great king of kings sitting there we'll see him we'll be able to look with our eyes and see him actually sitting there on his throne now he's sitting on his father's strong in other words he's sitting in god's power in spirit now but when he comes back he'll set an earthly body on david's throne now he's sitting in the majesty of father now when we say father it's jesus it's the spirit of god by the holy spirit in us now he's on his father's throne right hand of majesty i love the wording that paul uses the in the right hand of power and authority because that means wherever he's sitting he's not sitting there just to play around or just to just just to play a game or something but he's actually seated in power and authority wherever he's seated now now to really understand where he's seated you got to go back to the old testament types and kind of it kind of paints a picture in your mind so let's go to the next slide now in the old testament there was a seat and it was in the middle of that three-room house and i think we all know we've been taught well enough that we know where that three-room house was and we know the journey that you go through that three-room house justification sanctification the baptism in the holy ghost the light is uh you know as you go through the the the light on the outer corner it you know that they can be covered by the clouds and so forth and do all the types you get into the into the holy place and you've got the candlesticks they have to be kept lit and burning but once you get in the inside there's a kind of glory lights up that place all the time it's always lit and so in that place is a mercy seat it's a seat and it's kind of a think of us you wouldn't think of a seat as looking like this normally a seat would have a cushion maybe some armrests a place for actual body to sit down but this is not a place like a seat like that this is a a seat for deity a seat for deity to come actually and dwell in that place and there were requirements for the deity to be for god to come and be able to come and dwell in that place first there had to be blood sprinkling them on the mercy seat there had to be an atonement made there had to be you had to get the word uh packed in there you had to get um all the the process of going in there that the the priest had to go through all the all the rights and everything to be able to get in there but once you got in there once once the deed once all the requirements were met the deity god will say i'm saying the deity the deity we're talking about is god god would come and sit down on that seat but it's typing something it's typing something that would take place in the new testament that god can actually come down and sit himself in the bride and in psalm 99 1 i got the scripture written here it says the lord reigneth let the people trembleth he sitteth between the cherubims he actually sat on between the cherubims on that mercy seat that's where god set in the old testament as a type that one day he wouldn't be sitting between the cherubims anymore like that but he would be sitting in your in your tabernacle he sitteth between the cherubims and let the earth be moved so he sat in the center of that in the type of the center of the three-room house now brother brown in in in the next slide in 1961 he said now now the mercy seat now the mercy seats where's the mercy seat at in the heart see where the shining forth of his glory and all of his children the shekinah glory and the human heart here is the human heart the center of that three-room house is that right is that the mercy seat how do you come through it into that through these different systems through self-will comes into here and through here comes out what shekinah glory what is the shekinah glory is god's presence and when a man's walking or a woman he's reflecting the shekinah glory he don't go in the damn gambling dens and carry on and go out here and deny the word no matter what the people says he's got his heart set on one thing god and there's a there's a good evidence of whether or not god is sitting on the throne of your heart is whether you actually care about the things of god or not because once he's once did he has set down on that seat then it's going to change everything now you can see over i got some little diagrams that i pulled off the internet of of what the mercy seat looked like and what the tabernacle looked like and those are all kind of things to ponder and dwell on about what what what that means that that you need to think about the tabernacle is just a symbol of you and the mercy seat is a symbol of god coming down and dwelling in your heart excuse me now let's go to the next night sliding up now now brother ram said and just keeping on that on that thought he said now you say i got to in revelation chapter 4 number two he said i got to all right i can tell i can tell dirty jokes that don't condemn me why you ain't got nothing they can condemn no one's there to take it out no one's there to condemn you in other words before the holy ghost there's nobody seated in there that that god is not seated on your throne so nobody's there to condemn you but just skipping down he said there's nobody there's nothing there to judge you but when christ comes in what happened you created an altar on your heart and your sins are taken daily saint paul said i die daily nevertheless i live not me but christ liveth in me there's the inner veil what's the interval of god that god actually coming in into your heart past past that interval that was typed in the old testament testament to to to sit on your throne now let's go to uh the next slide and in acts chapter two now so so we know i mentioned earlier that paul peter actually quoted this scripture from psalms 110 on the day of pentecost and a lot of times we we uh we like to quote that he quoted joel you know this is that and he identified this now that that that joel said that he was poor spirit out on all flesh but we kind of skip over a lot of times that that peter quoted this scripture and and we'll read it here uh this jesus had god raised up wherever we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which he now see and hear for david now here's the scripture that he's quoting david david is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand until i make thy foes thy footstool now see we're just we're carrying on from what what paul is saying in hebrews 1 13 that sit on my right hand until i make down enemies that footstool now they're both quoting from david they said in psalms and jesus quoted this to the pharisees when when he began to say now you say that that that the messiah is going to be the son of david but how how could he be the son of david and yet david calls in the lord when he says the lord said unto my lord sit down on my right hand now you see there's all sorts of things bottled up in this little scripture here the lord said on my the lord said unto my lord what's that talking about sit thou on my right hand sit down on my right hand that sounds like that sounds like multiple people until i make all your enemies by my my footstool until i make until until everything's been conquered so there's a lot there to unpack the lord said unto my lord who's that talking about sitting on my right hand so i think we've already kind of established where god is sitting so and he's not sitting he's not sitting just to play around but he's sitting in power and authority and he's sitting there to do something to conquer all the enemies until every enemy is under his feet until he's made his footstool so let's keep reading if the next slide brother brown said in christ 1955 he said and through the blood you become a part of him into the same into the same cell that he came out of and the very presence and part of god comes into you by faith you purchase it and that same holy spirit that was in the lord jesus christ comes into you and he said if we keep reading down think of it brother how that god in his infinite mercy purchasing us through the blood of jesus and now sitting at the right hand of the majesty right hand means in power and authority that as a high priest to make intercessions upon anything that we confess that he has done after once coming into the fellowship sign your name on the check say here it is there you get it we believe that we get what we asked for because we've judged god to keep his word so now now god he's he's painting the same picture that paul painted that god sets down at the right hand of the majesty he sets down in power and authority to actually fulfill god's word and he's sitting down on the throne of your heart so he's sitting down on the throne of your heart in power as a high priest so there again is that picture that paul is trying to paint that christ is our high priest and what does the high priest the high priest goes in with the offering and he's there to to to to do all the all the working of of atoning for your sins and doing all fulfilling all the rights and all so christ actually goes into your heart with us with to show that the blood has been offered to do the work and he's he's the one that we we can pray to with with the surety and and uh knowing that he's he's touched by the feeling of our infirmities and with all those confidence because he is our high priest that's entered in beyond the veil to to make intercessions upon anything that we confess that he has done now let's go to the next slide and just keep kind of laying this out now in hebrews chapter one when brother brandon preached this this message he said what does right hand mean not god has a right hand that somebody is sitting on it right hand means the power and authority got the authority over everything in heaven and earth and all the heavens and earth is made by him and in the eagle as the eagle stirred up her nest he said he's sitting at the right hand of god on god's throne that's not his throne he's coming back to reign on his throne it's the throne of david he's to take his throne he's sitting on god's throne waiting till the last enemy is made his footstool now let's let's recap a little bit because i know some some people got in a little bit late this morning so his throne is that throne that actual physical throne where you can look over there and see jesus sitting on his throne but in the meantime he sits on his father's throne and we've established that by reading several quotes and and going through the scripture and going through the message that the father strong is the throne of your heart and so he said it he sets himself on the father's throne and while he's working something out he's he's doing he's accomplishing his purpose to overcome every enemy and we'll see we'll see later that the all the enemies include sickness includes sin includes it include the final enemy brother brown said was death so he sets himself down on the father's throne until every enemy until until he's working he's working it out until every enemy including death is conquered and when death is conquered death is conquered in you like brother ram said that you can you'll come to a place where you can wipe death off your sleeve you'll you'll be changed and go in a rapture now let's go to the next slide so again just what we're talking about is hebrews 1 13 but to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make thine enemies that footstool and we're diving into that now in revelation 1 16 it says he had it in his right hand seven stars and and brother branham again in the in the ephesian church age really hones in on what the right hand means he said there he is with the seven stars in his right hand the right hand or arms signifies the power and authority of god in psalm 144 3 for they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arms save them but thy right hand and that arm in that right hand of power are seven stars who according to revelation 1 20 are the seven church messengers and he said this signifies that the very power and authority of god are behind his messengers to every age they go forth in the fire and power of the holy ghost with the word how could they do that because deity is set down in the throne of their heart and because he sat down he sat down on the right hand of power and authority so they've got the holy ghost within them to preach the word in its entirety in his fullness and when god sets down on the heart of it when god sits down in your heart you can go with that same power and authority that god has set down in your heart let's go to the next slide and brother ram said uh uh well in revelation chapter 3 verse 21 it says to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne now we know where his throne is now his throne is going to be a a an actual throne that you can look at that you can go up to him and talk to him that when we get to the the new jerusalem you'll be able to go up to the very top of that pyramid that pyramid-looking city and you'll be able to sit down with him and tell him thank you for all that you've done for me and he'll say he'll say go my brother around and say go and enjoy all that just go and enjoy it however he worded it even as i also ever overcome and then sat down with my father in his throne so he's got a throne and the father has his throne and so you can see now that's where he is set down that paul is trying to explain to us and that peter said on the you see why peter said that on the day of pentecost because on the day of pentecost was the first time that god was able to set down on that throne he on the day of pentecost he actually came and dwelt in the believer for the first time that the price had been paid the atonement had been made the blood had been offered uh all all the the rights that were prophesied over the old testament have been fulfilled the way had been made and now deity could come and live and sit himself down on that throne like he always wanted to do and they identified christ of all ages brother adam said then when he died rose ascended and sent by the holy spirit that was the son of god god is a spirit and through the church age it's been son of god and then in the millennium is son of david sitting on the throne ruling that son of david the son of david dispensation is he him sitting on his throne he is ascended up he that overcomes shall sit with me on my throne as i have overcome and sit down on my father's throne he's sitting on the father's throne now but in the millennium he sits upon his own throne because he is the son of david son of man son of god some son of david see it's just perfectly and now and so he he's he's seated on the father's throne until every enemy is conquered so if we go to the next slide we we we're reminded that paul said in first corinthians that death is going to be the last enemy and paul said he said then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death now you're wondering why why do we come to church we're coming to church every day that we and i will be closing here in just a moment the reason that we come to church is to see the destruction of all these enemies to see that one that's seated on the throne of our heart have total dominion and total power over sin and sickness and death and and and and grief and sorrow and everything in our lives to give us a joy that passes everything that the world can throw at us because he's set down on the throne of our heart and the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death as he he's got so much power that he's rolling through with holy ghost that holy ghost fire he's rolling through everything that the world can can throw at it just consuming everything until until finally that last trumpets in the bible and in the book of revelation it says all all the kingdoms of the world every everything's been conquered by that by that conqueror now let's go let's close on this next slide so then you might wonder why do we need to understand daniel 70 weeks what's the purpose of daniel said in the weeks because daniel 70 weeks paints this picture so that's why brother ram said if you don't understand daniel 70 weeks how are you going to understand the seals because if you don't understand daniel 70 weeks you can't see what god is really doing you can't see that he's set down as christ as the high priest there through the seven church ages you can't see him sitting down at the beginning of this process right in 80 30 he died for us and then he sat down on the day of pentecost and he's been sitting down through the seven church ages and then when it's all accomplished he stands up so that he can go and take his throne all of that picture is painted in daniel 70 weeks so when you begin to really study and maybe you think that it's been a long a long hard slog maybe and things i've i've had i've had people actually cry to me saying i'm having a struggle trying to understand it but then the picture pops into view and you can begin to see it and we'll in the musicians can go ahead and come forward and we'll end that but see you see what christ is doing he's he's painting a picture for us so we'll understand and as the as the word is opened up to us and the seals are revealed to us we begin to understand what god has done for us and to us and how he has redeemed us and that's the picture that's painted in daniel 70 weeks
