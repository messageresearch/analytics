morning amen as we gather here today we've not gathered around religion or traditions but we've gathered around the word amen to surrender our lives to his word this evening and amen there's one thing we know the more we empty out of ourselves the more we'll receive of him amen and i truly believe that's what we all want to leave here with today is more of him a man not more religion or more uh church entity amen but more of the person jesus christ himself on the inside of the believers do you love him this afternoon amen if you have your bibles while you're standing with us today we'll go straight to the word we want to look in the book of mark the fifth chapter given brother joseph our scriptures back there but i've just added this one here so you all forgive me this morning but in the book of mark the fifth chapter we want to look and we also want to look in the book of luke the 16th chapter and we want to say it sure is an honor and a privilege to be here with you all once again and we sure thank brother wade and the church here for the invitation to come and to minister to you today amen and we just want to look here in the book of mark the fifth chapter and i want to look in the 21st verse it's a very very familiar reading in mark the fifth chapter the 25th or the 21st verse the bible says when jesus was passed over again by ship and to the other side much people gathered unto him and he was unto the sea and behold there cometh one of the the synagogue jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet and it sought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death i pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and shall live and jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him now jesus is on his way somewhere and here is is interrupted by a lady it says in a certain woman which had an issue of blood for 12 years think about this for 12 years and had suffered many things of many physicians and it's been all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse and when she had heard of jesus now notice she heard of him she came in the press behind him and touched his garment for she said if i may touch but his clothes i shall be whole i i love this because no matter how long you've had the condition there's still a possibility for change and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague and jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes and his disciples said unto him thou seest the multitude thronging me and says who touched me and he looked around to see her and had done this thing but the woman fearing and trembled now let's just sit like this this was needless fear she didn't need this fear this woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her she came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague also in the book of luke the 16th chapter the book of luke the 16th chapter i want to read a verse there amen you love the lord this morning or this afternoon luke the 16th chapter and the 16th verse jesus here is speaking and he's just actually reproved the pharisees and in the 16th verse he says now the law and the prophets were until john and since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man presseth into it let's read this verse together the law and the prophets were until john and since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man presseth into it would you would you mind reading one more place with me hebrews 11. i know every bible believer here this morning could read this by heart but in hebrews 11 i want to look at the first verse hebrews 11 and verse 1. paul here speaking about the heroes of faith and the nature and the fruits of faith he says here in hebrews 11 and verse 1 it says now faith is a substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear amen we ask the lord this as we just borrow our hearts together here this morning heavenly father lord as your believers have gathered here today lord as these young people stand before me this morning this congregation today lord lord i feel inadequate to stand here lord father i have no abilities of my own to offer no personality lord but i believe that this message that you've seen in this generation lord was not just sent to the elders or to the preachers or to the or the officers of the church but it was sent to the young people and lord i believe this morning if we can get ourselves out of the way that we can receive something of supernatural value from your word now father i invite you this morning to come take preeminence of both speaker and hearer and lord may you drive out every evil spirit oh god may you bind the hand of the enemy lord may liberty come into this building this this day lord father if there would be sickness among us lord may you heal them if there would be bondage lord may you set them free i pray oh god this morning you would drive it from the midst of the congregation lord may be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers says amen and amen and may god bless you this morning as you may have your seats here today amen i want to okay i want to help with the lord uh here from these scriptures this morning amen for just a few moments i would like to speak to you if i would title this thought today i want to talk to you for a few moments on anointed for a breakthrough anointed for a breakthrough i believe amen this morning that we are not gathered here just as church members i don't believe we're gathered here just as people fulfilling religious duties or doing things uh maybe of a religious nature amen but i believe we're here today as believers and i believe that god has called us he has ordained us amen he has chosen us he has elected us amen he's actually called us from before the foundation of the world amen to the places that we are today amen as i began to look at this here in mark the fifth chapter amen you know the story very well of the woman with the issue of blood and you know that how that she had suffered these things for the bible says for 12 years she had been plagued and she had been to doctors she had been to physicians she had been all over the place and been trying to receive help but she was nothing better amen but she only grew worse and we find that at some point in her life or at some time amen amen she heard of a man named jesus she heard amen that there was a healer there was a deliverer amen and the bible actually says that she heard of jesus and when she heard of him it put her into action and the bible says that she came in the press behind and she touched the hem of his garment now we could all say it this way she was perseverant right amen she was perseverant now you know the prophet of god is going to preach a message called amen perseverance right he says now this morning we want to talk on faith he says now my subject this morning is perseverance he said for perseverance means to be persistent amen to make a goal so it's not just to be casual amen it's not just to be drifting or floating or wondering amen but it's to have a target right it's to have a vision is to have something that you're aiming for and another place he said man that's ever amounted to anything at any time through any age has been men who believed in god they had faith in god and they stood against the enemy on every side and was perseverant because they believed in god think about that he meant a man that is ever amounted to anything he meant at any time through any age has been men who believed in god and had faith in god amen and stood against the enemy on every side he meant and was perseverant because they believed in god he said now i believe every christian amen should be very perseverant think about that amen i believe every christian should be very perseverant amen he's not saying to be casual he's not saying to be lukewarm he's not saying to be just a church member but he's saying have a drive about you amen amen have something pushing you have something motivating you amen i believe every christian should be very perseverant amen amen brother i don't know what's happened in my ear but it's changed since the song service if you could put it back the way it was that'd be great amen in luke the 16th chapter amen in the 16th verse jesus here is actually speaking he's not speaking about being casual he's speaking about being persevered he said the law and the prophets were until john and since that time the kingdom of god is preached now somebody say preached amen the kingdom of god is preached and every man presseth into it look at what this word presseth means it means to suffer violence it means to use force it means to apply force it means to inflict violence upon now here he's saying amen if you're going to come in the kingdom of god he meant at some point or another you're going to have to use some violence amen you're going to have to use some force you're going to have to push your way amen and look at matthew 11 12 he says from the days of john the baptist until now somebody say until now amen until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence amen but the violent take it by force isn't that amazing amen that the lord jesus is speaking about the kingdom he's speaking about people possessing the kingdom at the same time he's speaking about people becoming violent telling them now who are we becoming violent against are we becoming violent against our brother violent against our sister the prophet said i'm not trying to be rough but you cannot baby devil see amen you've got to let them know who is boss he said and we are boss now amen amen because jesus is here amen our big brother our big brother of redemption is here amen so the prophet is saying you're going to have to apply some force amen against the devil you're going to have to use some violence against the devil amen you can't just get casual and lay down and say well amen if i'm to receive the holy ghost then maybe some preacher will come through sometime amen and i'll hear the right quotes or read the right scripture amen but you've got to get desperate amen amen you've got to get and think about this amen the prophet preaches the message the token and follows it that night with a sermon called desperation he said seek desperation when thou seekest me amen with all thy heart then i'll hear you he meant he said amen see the law and the prophets were until john amen and since the kingdom of heaven's been preached and man press into it amen you don't just stand around and say pick me up by the collar lord and push me in but you press into it he said you get desperate it's between life and death amen amen if you want the holy ghost get desperate amen if you want deliverance hey men get desperate now amen if it's okay i'm just going to preach it for a minute amen because i think we're getting a little too casual he meant about serving god i think we're getting a little too casual amen about this message i think if there's ever been a time amen for a group of young people to raise up he meant under the anointing and the authority that this message has been delivered in i think it's now amen amen if there's ever been a young woman amen to really get persevered about the things of god i believe you are the young ladies amen if there's ever been young men that get on fire ignore the fire the holy ghost of this message you are the young men to do it you say well brother andrew there's an age coming there is no more ages coming amen we are in the final age we've got the final message amen we're living in the final hours amen if there's ever been a time to do something for god now's the time to do it amen now's the time to get desperate brother said see it's between life and death it's between life and death now think about this amen then where is that desire coming from in your heart he said when you seek me with all thy heart amen then i'll hear you amen the prophet said see that is not an unrighteous desire that is a righteous desire amen how many come here today to this service with a desire in your heart amen you one of you came amen two of you three of you amen how many came here today with a desire in your heart maybe maybe a healing or maybe maybe a deliverance or maybe an answer from the lord amen do you realize that that devil that you're fighting did not put that desire in your heart amen if you've got a desire to receive something from god amen that did not come from the devil amen it did not come from hell amen but that desire came from almighty god amen the prophet said see when i say this amen i want to be dead earnest with you he said when we when we when he speaks to me i can just say what he showed me he said whether it's good or bad i have to say it and sometimes it's not pleasant to tell people these things he said but yet i'm just just duty-bound amen to tell people the evil things that will befall them as i am duty-bound to tell them the good things that will befall them amen do you realize that when a prophet stood before the congregation he was not in control of his own voice he was not in control of his thoughts amen he was surrendered to a higher power than what he was saying was not coming from his office or coming from his church or coming from some school what he was saying was coming from god himself amen and the faker prophet would stand there amen now how many believes that brother branham was a prophet amen let's let's drive that devil out of the building for a minute we believe that william branham was a vindicated prophet of this age he meant with the message of malachi 4 that would turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers we we believe that right amen then let's say it this way he was a vindicated prophet now amen you realize that when a prophet stands amen before a congregation he's looking at them but he's also seen in another realm like like i could be looking at you amen but a prophet would be looking at you but he would be looking at something in another realm that's why he would say i see you with a heart trouble or i see you with the nervousness so i see you with some you were bit by a dog as a child and that thing has followed you all amen he was looking in another dimension amen then he would come back and say hey man i see a black streak and it's going from one to another while it's a cancer he said see i see it there and you're free of that cancer and people would rejoice because they were healed he would say now that devil's exposed there and you're healed that see he was seeing things in another dimension and he was coming back down to the church and he was telling them what he was seeing in another dimension amen how many believes that a prophet sees the negative in another dimension we believe that amen then if we can believe he sees the negative in another dimension then this morning i want to talk to you about what he saw in the positive is that okay in a message show us the father it'll suffice paragraph 13 amen it's right before he reads the scripture and if you're not really even paying attention you'll read right over it he said now don't doubt just have faith to believe he said and i believe god's going to give us a breakthrough tonight i believe it's on the audience and then think about that i believe that god is going to give us a breakthrough tonight i believe it's on the audience amen then just as he could see depression he meant an anxiety and all kinds of demon spirits upon the audience i believe a prophet could see a breakthrough upon the audience and he said i believe it's going to happen tonight amen now how was the prophet speaking the prophet was speaking by the word of faith amen he was speaking by the word of faith in the book of romans the 10th chapter and the eighth verse the bible says it like this but what saith it amen the word is nigh thee it is even in thy mouth in the heart he said that is the word of faith which we preach amen that is the word of faith which we preach amen look what that word preach means it means to publish it means to proclaim openly something which has been done think about that it means to stand before a congregation to stand before a group of people and to boldly amen and strongly proclaim amen something has been done with the intent that if it's been done before it'll be done again oh god what are you saying preacher i'm saying amen that the word has delivered a young person before and i stand here this morning to say if the word did it before the word will do it again amen the word has healed the young people before if the word did it before the word will do it again amen the word of god has never failed in the mouths of believing christians amen now let me just go and let you a little secret okay amen i'm going to preach amen and if i've got to do the preaching and the amen it'll take twice as long to get out of here okay amen so if you want to get out of here quicker help me amen amen somebody is going to believe what they're hearing preached amen somebody is going to receive amen the word of faith amen i find it amazing that jesus himself stood and he said i must preach think about this i must preach the kingdom of god amen to other cities for therefore am i seen the prophet said i must preach the truth regardless of how it hurts i must preach the truth regardless of how it hurts amen or what it hurts he's telling you we must preach the word amen somebody say preach the word we must preach the word i think it's amazing when paul was writing to timothy there he says it like this preach the word amen be instant in season and out of season you reprove you rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine amen the prophet said i want my friends both here and out in the lands where these tapes will go the reason i have took the stand i have for the word is this very reason preach the word amen that's the reason i would not talia with any of these creeds any of these denominations because i've been commissioned of god to stay with the word now if anybody else wants to do anything else that's up to them but he's saying my commission is stay with the word amen preach the word amen what are you saying i'm saying liberty comes by the word amen anybody want deliverance today it'll come by the word anybody want freedom today it'll come by the word anybody want victory today it'll come by the word that's why the prophet said we must stay with the word amen the prophet said see a few years ago in the holy ghost before it came he said the church began to get formal back in the days of methodist he said and you people cried to god amen for deliverance and god sent down the baptism of the spirit now since then people has been liberated amen from their sins by receiving the baptism of the holy ghost is that right he said now those who do not believe in it amen they cannot receive it amen you've got to believe in it therefore listen to this therefore he sent anointed preachers to preach the word and you received it amen he sent anointed preachers he meant to preach the word and you received it amen then god sent his word amen by anointed preachers amen the prophet will take time to show you how amen that when a person is preparing their chickens amen for the brooding house seem anybody here got chickens if you've got chickens you know what a prophet is talking about he said they're preparing them for that brooding house he said they'll place the eggs under the regulation of the heat in order for them to hatch he said see now in it don't you thank god for sending the country prophet amen amen somebody you could relate to amen he talks about putting chickens in a brewing house and placing them just right so the eggs will hatch then he turns brother's hand amen to anointed preachers and he said see then he has sent anointed preachers he anoints preachers amen they're sent out to bring the word to put the eggs in the right position he said then he sent this same word and anchors it out there and then comes over and hovers it by the holy ghost he says until that word becomes life amen until that word becomes life in the human heart and all the devils in hell amen could not keep it out of there amen no sir whatever the egg is it'll bring forth and he said the holy ghost will brood over the church until the word comes to life old church of the living god amen what have we gathered here today amen not to sing a bunch of songs not to hear a sermon amen not just to see each other we have gathered here until the word of almighty god amen becomes life in the church becomes life in a young person and i'm just going to be myself and preach for a second amen i think that's what we need we've had enough clothes we have enough ideas enough traditions what we need is the life of god amen to come back in the church until it burns sin out until it burns unbelief out until some young person amen can stand in a place of liberty in a place of freedom in a place of joy of the salvation of god amen the holy ghost does not come to condemn the holy ghost is come amen to make the word life in the heart of the believer my to think this morning he is here amen to make his word real how many would say lord make it real to me he is here to make his word life how many would say make it life in me amen i don't want to just leave here with another sermon i don't just want to leave here hearing a few more songs i want to leave here with life amen the bible says in romans 10 13 amen for whosoever amen shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved amen the bible says how then shall they call on him whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard now can i preach to you how shall they hear without a preacher how shall they hear without a preacher how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things amen but they have not all obeyed the gospel for isaiah saith the lord who hath believed i report amen see so what does the devil do the devil fights the preaching of the gospel the devil fights anointed preaching of the gospel the prophet said see the only thing amen now you wonder why the devil fights to preach of the word anybody ever wondered that amen well if you listen to a prophet you'll you'll find the answer the devil fights the preaching of the word because the preaching of the word cast out the devil he said the only thing that kept me from being saved when i was 12 years old amen was because a spirit hung over me amen let's say that together a spirit hung over me let's say that together a spirit hung over me what was it a devil saying wait a little while longer amen amen if we got any 12 year olds here today is there anybody you're 12 years old buddy amen a prophet of god said he was your age and he said i would have given my heart to god a lot sooner he said but now listen there's a 12 year old boy has got a spirit hanging over him amen who's going to be a prophet of god who's going to speak squirrels into existence who's going to stop storms in colorado who's going to receive the revelation of the word of seven seals amen but the spirit hung over him as a twelve-year-old boy amen saying wait a little bit longer he said that's the reason you wasn't saved when you become the age of accountability he said because a spirit maybe you got with a crowd and that hovered over you and it kept hanging over you you wanted to do right he said but there's not a man that's got his right mind amen but what wants to do right but there's something won't let you do right amen see that's why the devil fights hey man he fights you amen there's a spirit hanging over you that won't let you do right is that right amen he said see that's the devil amen let's have church here today amen let's just expose that old day of hope amen that spirit hanging over you is a devil it comes from the pits of hell and there's a word here today he meant to send it in the direction back to hell amen where it come from that you could receive the liberty of jesus christ is that right he said christ paid for your healing christ just doesn't pay for your salvation now listen to this he commissioned his church to do what to cast them devils out amen he commissioned his church to cast them devils out amen there you are in my name they shall cast out devils amen he said listen you ain't going to heal nobody amen are you hearing me amen salvation is paid for this morning amen healing is paid for the preacher is not going to save anybody amen the preacher brother louis it's not going to heal anybody he said but what you are going to do is you're going to cast the devil away from them so they can accept the healing that i've already done for them amen see in other words when preachers stand on the platform and preach the gospel the devil scatter amen the man come to the altar under conviction and say i want to get saved he never saved the man the preacher never saved the man he cast out the devil and the man got saved oh glory i mean like shout right there amen he cast out the devil and the man got saved are you hearing me this morning anybody want to get saved anybody want the holy ghost anybody want healing here this morning amen i don't have to do nothing amen but preach the word your healing's done paid for your salvation is done paid for the holy ghost is done paid for the only thing that's got to be done is that devil that's standing between you and the purchase power the purchase promise has got to be cast away oh god can i preach this morning when the preachers preaching devils scatter amen he said see you sick here this morning believe that you've been born again and are sons and daughters of god then christ has already healed you juvenile diabetes is already healed amen high blood pressure is already healed cancer is already healed he said see the only thing keeps you from being well this morning is a spirit hanging over you you realize there's some of you right now want to say amen but there's a spirit hanging over you saying you can't say amen you want to raise your hands but there's a spirit hanging over you saying you cannot raise your hands you want to rejoice in the liberty we're with christ that set you free but there's an old spirit hanging over you saying you ain't got a right to rejoice you ain't got a right to raise your hands but i take the authority of god's word this morning and i cast out the evil one and i say make way for the liberty of the holy ghost amen to fall in this church until every spirit is broken every power is defeated i'm not going to save anybody this morning but i have been sent to preach the word until every spirit hanging over you begins to back up it begins to scatter the brother said see it's hanging here this morning he said it won't let you fully go out yonder and believe amen god's promise amen you really want to believe how many believers have we got here today you really want to believe amen but the spirit hangs between you and that promise and says you can't go out there and believe it amen but let me say it like a prophet said i believe with all of my heart that every demon power that's in here at this minute is already broken glory to god amen right here at four o'clock amen at 4 10 in the afternoon every demon power that's in this building right now is all ready broken amen he says i do believe every sick person in here right now feels a lot different if that's right raise up your hand you who is sick see you what's the matter that devil has broke away from you he has to because faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of god amen see then what does preach of the word do it cast out the devil what else does preaching the word do the prophet said the preaching of the word actually brings a blood veil down in the church he said see through the preaching of the word it brought down the blood veil he said and in there you see that someone died in your place he said then you'll throw down all your earthly possessions all your faint angle ideas all you're dancing you're immoral living and all these things you've thought up in your own self that you go to church and you know your rules and your ten commandments you're not eating meat oh god all these things you lay them aside when you see the blood amen when you see the blood come down amen is there anybody here this morning want to go to a place where there is no devil anybody want to go to a place where there is no fear where there is no anxiety where there is no devil power anybody want to go there anybody want to go to a place where the devil is bound let me say it like this anybody want to go to a place where the devil can't even get in the devil can't even get in well then where can we go brothers hack amen if we got to go into some other dimension i'll tell you what the prophet said he said while the word is being preached a blood veil is coming down he said and by faith you go through that blood veil he said and you're behind the blood and the devil amen can't even get to you because you're behind the blood and if he did get to you he'd have to come to the blood himself come on young people there's a place we can go where there is no covet there's a place we can go where there is no fear there's a place we can go where there is no anxiety there's a place we can go where there is no peer pressure there's a place we can go where there is no fear where there is no tormenting spirits where is that place amen it is behind the blood in christ jesus see then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god amen faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god the prophet said see or the word of god made manifest amen so it's not just reading amen the word that faith cometh by it's by hearing the word of god made manifest when you hear that god done it for somebody else it increases your faith to believe if he did it for somebody else he can do it for me is that right amen can i give you an example amen the prodigal said like this he said see the holy ghost is here somebody say is here it's here to reveal to you that god is not a way off object or a historical something he said he is a living present tense his word made manifest he's hid himself in human veil in his church revealing himself by your faith he meant in my faith coming together making the unit of god he said i can do nothing without you you can do nothing without me neither could do neither could do anything without god amen so together it makes the unit the connection he said god sent me for the purpose now listen he's showing you that there's a amen how many likes dramas how many likes please amen there's actually a drama taking place here this morning amen how many knows in a drama amen i'm not talking about church drama or family drama i'm talking about a play amen in a drama amen there's parts got to be played and if one person misses their part it can throw the entire play off amen amen amen there's an expected end oh god there's an expected end amen somebody has wrote them what can i preach this morning somebody's wrote the drama somebody's wrote the script brother samuel but there's got to be somebody amen fulfill the different parts are you with me amen amen now this is going to be real stupid or real simple but can i can i can i give you a drama okay amen amen you got a you got a house you got a table and you got a grocery store hey and you're going to have people over to eat you got to have somebody amen going to go to the grocery store the end of the play is somebody is going to sit at the table and eat amen but you're going to have parts somebody's got to go get the food somebody's got to cook it somebody's got to set the table somebody's got to prepare hey are you hearing me there's parts to be played amen and if one part is missing then the expected end will not come up amen but when that writer writes that play he chooses somebody amen to play the parts ain't meant to fulfill the roles amen that the expected end might be wrote oh and to think this morning that that same lord jesus amen that said he would send anointed preachers it's the same god who said i have good thoughts towards you they're not evil thoughts they meant to give you an expectation then right here this morning in this service you've got a part to play come on you've got a part to play what about that i'm not preaching you got a part to play i'm not it you've got a part to play the prophet said you bring your faith and i bring my faith he said see and neither of us could do anything without god he said so when god sent me for the purpose i have amen i have fulfilled my part this morning amen god called me to preach he called me he placed a gift in my life to preach this message amen brother wade called me and asked me to come and speak amen i have showed up this morning i have studied i've prepared i've talked i've i'm given to you what i believe god laid on my heart to give you i have come here to fulfill my purpose god sent me here for the purpose he said now notice here's the next part is you believe it amen amen the preacher can stand here and preach it perfectly and preach it from every direction but until somebody believes it amen nothing's going to happen he said but when i come for my purpose and you believe your purpose then something's going to happen glory to god i believe here this morning amen something is happening something is happening the prophet said you can only serve god as you do amen as you believe the servants that god sends you you can only serve god on earth see as god's servants are sent on the earth by divine inspiration interprets the word to you and you believe it see then as i am standing here amen interpreting or preaching the word to you amen you've got to believe it you've got to believe it well by the andrew i don't want to believe it well if it was my opinion you've got a right not to believe it if it was my idea you've got a right not to believe it but i have given myself amen to study what a prophet said and if i'm going to feel a pulpit i'm going to say what a prophet said therefore there's no question on whether we can believe it or not if a prophet said it amen somebody's going to preach it and somebody's going to believe it see amen were they writing an example how many knows there was a girl in the bible named hannah the bible says you know there's a girl there named hannah right hannah was a barren woman she had never had a child the bible says she was bearing a reproach for being a barren woman the prophet of god said one day she got in her house and she got to read the scrolls and she received a revelation from god you're going to have a baby now brother wade here's what's amazing to me but let me say when hannah received that revelation you're going to have a baby he said she automatically went to church she automatically went to church so whatever revelation hannah got didn't keep her out of church it brought her to church whatever revelation she received didn't keep her away from the church it didn't elevate her above the church her revelation actually brought her to the church the prophet said she come in the church now watch this he said she interrupted the service he said she come in and she was screaming she was shouting she was rejoicing and she ran down to the altar and he says the minister eli the priest amen came out of the study and he walked up to her and he said how long will you be drunk on strong drink she said i'm not drunk she said god met me this morning and said hannah you're going to receive a child and you're going to give birth to a child and i'm going to remove the reproach over your life that you've been carrying all these years and she said eli all i know is something clicked on the inside of my soul i pushed through criticism i pushed through unbelievers to get here amen and the prophet of god said eli looked at her you know what eli was he was the preacher he was the anointed preacher he looked at her and said that's thus saith the lord he said she went on and announced with god's blessings now and i preached to you for a second she had to go through the hall of critics to get there she had to walk through the hall of critics she had to walk amen through people saying there's that barren woman there's that barren child that barred woman never had a child amen but she kept on going and she kept on pressing amen now let me show you something amen just because you make it to church don't mean things are automatically going to get easier it don't mean things are automatically going to get better she went to church brother zach amen with that kind of faith should god not have come down and give her a child right there and she come out of the building carrying the child but the prophet said that god made her wait nine months he made her wait nine months that that child could come to full maturity listen friends as a sign to show you amen are you willing to stand the test and the persecution after you've received the promise come on now amen let's let's come on let's preach a minute amen amen amen you realize she walked through critics to get to church do you realize when she left she walked to the same critics on the way to church they said hannah where are you going she said i'm going down to church what are you going for because god give me a promise i'm going to have a child they said oh yeah sure you are that's right brother oh yes sure you are yes sure you're going to have a child sure you're going to have a baby amen we'll see amen and she come back amen do you realize she didn't even stop to listen to him they were still there criticizing her but faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god and she received the word of faith in her womb that manifested a child what are you saying i'm saying somebody's going to preach it amen eli was going to preach that god is able to give a child god is able amen the prophet said you know where she got inspiration to believe from from sarah amen eli broke brother lewis no doubt eli preached about sarah and hannah sat there brother and heard heard eli minister about sarah and one day oh god amen one day brother bob the revelation dropped in her heart right there in the middle of the service while eli was preaching i can imagine brother zach amen hannah stood up and said if god did it for sarah he's going to do it for me if god did it for her he's going to do it for me if he did it before he can do it again because he's god and his word is true and his power is here to perform the word glory to god amen something anchored in her heart and she began to testify i'm going to have a child are you hearing me amen somebody's going to preach it somebody's going to preach it and somebody oh god let me just say it like this somebody's going to preach god as a savior somebody is going to preach god as a healer somebody is going to preach that god gives the holy ghost somebody is going to preach that god breaks the strongholds of pornography somebody is going to preach that you are more than an overcomer somebody is going to preach greater is he that is in you that he that is in the world somebody is going to preach william branham was a prophet somebody is going to preach the seventh seal is hoping somebody is going to preach the third pull somebody is going to preach the future home somebody is going to preach revelation 10 1 is fulfilled are you hearing me somebody's going to preach it but now let's turn a corner if somebody's going to preach it then somebody's got to believe it is there any believers here this morning it says as long as somebody will preach it i will believe it because i'm a believer somebody's going to preach it somebody's going to believe it and when somebody preaches it and somebody believes it we're going to have a breakthrough come on we're going to have a breakthrough i believe it's on the audience here tonight can i bring that to lula georgia in the year of 2021 when covet is raging through the land when churches are closing when people's hearts are failing for fear when people can't even come to the house of god no more amen i believe somebody is going to take a rapture i believe somebody is going to take a body change i'm not a crazy man i'm a believer i believe the word it's the word of faith see the prophet said what time is this this is adoption time when the bible would say that as many as are led by the spirit of god they are what they are the sons of god he says for ye have not received the spirit of bondage somebody say the spirit of bondage the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption somebody say the spirit of adoption the spirit of adoption amen whereby we cry amen in that amazing we don't nod and we don't give a thumbs up amen amen but we actually cry we actually get vocal we actually open our mouth amen we cry how about our father amen do you realize what's happening there is a pentecostal age amen and the prophet said it this way he said by sensations and emotions is where pentecost missed it they went by who was speaking in tongues now now hey man you should be there this is the youth service i know but i'm preaching some stability if that's okay amen we don't go by feelings we don't go by sensations that's where pentecost missed it amen one day if they were shouting they were saved and the next day if they were in the mulley grubs they were lost amen but this message has brought us to an adoption faith which is without the spirit of bondage again to fear amen let me let me you oh god can i preach for a minute amen people tell me all the time they say well this message is so real that how come we can't find the prophet's quotes in the scriptures i said well how come you can't read i said i'm going to show you romans 8 14 and 15 right here in a message called god rich in mercy i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away somebody say get away get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are you're not going to be but now you are the sons of god see you always were the sons of god so the spirit of bondage again to fear one day i'm a son one day i'm not one day i'm heaven bound one day i'm hell-bound amen but the spirit of adoption has quickened your soul he meant to believe if i ever was the son of god i always was the son of god if my name was ever on the lamb's book of life it was always on the lamb's book of life and there ain't enough devils in hell or spirits hanging over the church today that can take that out of our hearts i'm not talking about intellectual i'm talking about supernatural hello i'm not talking about intellectual i'm talking about supernatural intellectual deals with the head supernatural deals with the heart amen and the prophet of god said we today are god's spiritual church with a spiritual law written on the tables of our heart we are being led in a spiritual form isn't that amazing then whatever the spirit of god in you will lead your soul to believe that is yours are you hearing me what oh god whatever the spirit of god in you will lead your soul to believe that is yours now come on well brother andrew then we don't need preachers oh yes we do what does andrew if we got the spirit of god we don't need a preacher amen a preacher stands there to confirm the word that's in your soul anybody ever anybody ever been to a to a concert to a singing or something he ever been to a concert you get tickets right hey it astounds me you get tickets much in advance you've had months to look at those tickets you know what i'm saying you know if you get a ticket and that ticket says you're in row four seat eight you know that you've been looking at that ticket i'm in row four i'm in seat eight amen you know what amazed me and you get there and brother lewis there's some at the door that says show me your ticket why it's paid for no show me your ticket so you show them their ticket and they say follow me and you say well where are you taking me i'm taking it to your seat i'm going to show you your seed well i know my seat well follow me i'm gonna take you to you are you hearing me are you hearing me and they lead you they lead you to your seat and they say here's rope four and there's seat eight and brother wade in your mind you're thinking i knew that before i even met you amen but you needed somebody amen that could lead you and could confirm what you was carrying oh glory to god listen friends we have got a message we have got books we have got tapes amen but may i say thank god for sending holy ghost-filled preachers who will stand behind the pulpits and will refer to what a prophet said to confirm the word of faith in our heart that when we see the holy ghost moving we can say the waters are troubled it's time to step in when we see the shaking in the mulberry bush and the angels flowing out of the benches of heaven we know it's time to go to war glory god has sent a spirit with anointed preachers with an anointed word to lead us and guide us into all truth now the prophet said this can i have a few more minutes the prophet said see he said the power that will raise us up is right in us now if you've got a shadow of the power of god in you you've got power to speak a world into existence and go live a private life on it if you can what believe it then whatever god somebody say whatever god will lead your soul to believe that is yours whatever god will lead your soul to believe that is yours what did zachariah say he said not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord then what happens the word remember it's in it's in wisdom versus faith he said the word was already sown in the disciples the word was already sown him he said then what happened he said he sent his spirit he meant to energize the word he said the water of the word of faith energizes the word of god and makes it work see then there is an energy coming in the church amen it's not energizer bunny amen it's not it's not five hour energy it's not red bull it's not monsters amen it's a holy ghost energy it's a holy ghost energy flowing in the church energizing your heart energizing your soul come on church energizing you to raise your hands energizing you to sing energizing you to clap you all know as well as i know there's times you've come in here you didn't even feel like being here but before you left you left with a blessing you know why because there was an energy of the holy ghost amen flowing through the church that was energizing your innermost being to believe god is still god and his word is still true and his power is still here are you hearing me amen and when that energy comes in the church problem says when you really realize that god has revealed to you the truth of the thing there's nothing in the world going to defeat you in it you're absolutely somebody say you're absolutely say i am absolutely brother says you're absolutely undefeatable not you but god that's in you amen see not christ not the body he said but this the word that was in him not mary but the word that was born from her then the prophet said you become the word as you receive the word when you really realize the truth of the thing you are absolutely can i can i finish this you are you are absolutely undefeatable come on come on one with this your blood you've had it for 12 years amen 12 years of bad doctors reports has not defeated you oh god amen 12 years of doctor visits has not defeated you 12 years of disappointments has not defeated you are you hearing me she had been holding on for 12 years when she heard of jesus and i preached it for a minute brother zach when she heard of jesus the bible says the blood was flowing from her body amen i don't know amen y'all know that that if you ain't got blood you ain't gonna live long if you're losing blood you ain't gonna live much longer amen and the bible says this woman's blood was flowing from her body she was in a terrible condition let me say it like this she didn't even have the physical strength he meant to press through the crowd she didn't have the physical strength ain't meant to get through the press amen then brother zack where did her strength come from i'll tell you where it come from amen the word is a seed and that word had been sown in her and she had heard there was a man named jesus passing by and when she heard jesus was passing by the spirit of god glory to god the spirit of god began to energize her it's your last chance but believe again it's your last opportunity are you hearing me where was her energy coming from it was coming from the spirit where is your energy coming from it's coming from the spirit oh god i hope you're hearing me when you when you're too weak to even believe in your human elements in your human body there is an energy the brother said there's an energy flowing he said there's an energy flowing through the church he said that is literally electrifying go look it up it's a direct quote the energy of the holy spirit is literally is literally electrifying the church of the living god come on let's preach this morning church amen there's a liberty in here there's electricity flowing it's not coming from edison it's not coming from appalachian power or whoever supplies your power it's coming from god come on young people amen why are you still here in the face of everything you fought why are you still believing in the face of ever let down you've had because there's a word there's a seed that's been sown in you and there's a spirit here amen to energize the word that was sown in you oh glory to god i may be persecuted so was mary but you know what my prophet said he said when jesus christ when was christ jesus he was being formed and married that's when the persecution set in come on when that woman was getting the closest to the hell of his garment that's when the persecution set in and when christ jesus was being formed in the womb of mary he said that's when the persecution set in but can i tell you what amen i'm gonna i'm gonna take the breaks off and preach here for a second amen if that's okay amen mary broke through he meant she was anointed to break through you know why because she was carrying mary was carrying the breakthrough hello mary was carrying the breakthrough what is the breakthrough the breakthrough is the word the breakthrough's not a shout the breakthrough is not a dance we do those things when we do break through amen but the breakthrough is the word which scatters the devil that a son of god amen can believe the word concerning them glory to god are you hearing me church we are going to break through we are anointed to break through what are we we are believers we are believers we believe the word of promise then what does the word of faith and the word of promise say vermont says now listen to this he says now care all this message how many cares for all the message you want it all 47 to 65. three pulls seven seals seven you want it all theophany he said carry all this message and when you listen to the tape even maybe i'll be gone someday when the lord is finished with me here on the earth and you'll refer back to this listen to my voice what i'm telling you if he takes me before his coming you just remember i spoke to you in the name of the lord by the word of the lord if he takes me before his coming you refer back to what's said on them tapes under my voice it's been said can i have some liberty in the name of the lord by the word of the lord and the prophet said see what is it it is vindicated words in other words brother wade what you hear on them tapes it's okay to repeat what you hear a prophet say it's okay to say and a prophecy of a breakthrough amen was vindicated words then when i heard a prophet say don't doubt just have faith and believe i believe there's a breakthrough going to happen tonight it's on the audience i didn't receive that as passing comments i didn't receive that as the words of inspiration of a man i received that as a prophetic word that somebody is going to be in laodicea under all kinds of pressure under all kinds of fears under all kinds of anxieties but they're going to break through it they're going to break through it because the word the word is in them the spirit is energizing the word oh god what did peter say he said there's an entrance somebody say entrance there's an entrance which shall be ministered unto you he says abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ then what are we doing here we are entering into the influence of another kingdom what did jesus say in the model prayer he says thy kingdom come the kingdom of heaven is preached thy kingdom come thy will be done in the earth as it is in heaven are you hearing me amen thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven then what that tells me is is there's a kingdom people on the earth who is manifesting the kingdom of heaven on earth now what is his will his will is his word see then he said thy word thy will thy will be done thy word be done on earth as it is in heaven now as i try to land this this bow in 777 there's one of two things going to happen to you in this age are you hearing me there's one of two things going to happen you're either going to have a breakthrough or you're going to have a breakdown you're either going to have a breakthrough or you're going to have a breakdown what brother andrew there's not that big of a difference there is a difference see a breakdown listen what a breakdown is a breakdown is a mechanical failure mechanical are you with me a mechanical failure a failure of relationship or system but watch this but a breakthrough so in other words you can have all the mechanics and still have a breakdown but but a breakthrough i love this is a sudden dramatic important discovery or development it is an instance of achieving success in a particular sphere or activity what does the word sphere mean it means domain it means realm or kingdom so peter said a entrance into the everlasting kingdom shall be preached unto you and ye shall enter in are you hearing me amen the problem of god listen i want you to hear this the problem of god standing in the discernment line he says almighty god author of life and gave her of every good gift send thy blessings upon this woman and heal her thou art here lord and this devil knows his time has come the devil knows his time has come to this woman he says entering into this fear of faith here to this woman entering this fear of faith here he knows he's got to lose he cannot hold her any longer well may i in closing may i tell the devil amen in this church service this afternoon upon these young people satan you've got to turn loose you can't hold them any longer you've tried but your power is defeated you've tried to hold on you've tried to bind them but the spirit of a breakthrough is flowing through the church there's an energy coming we're going to break through you're entering this fear of faith here he knows he's going to lose he cannot hold her any longer listen thou deaf spirit come out of her in the name of jesus christ i charge thee to lead the woman now watch this can you hear me he says do you hear me amen now notice this this was in the ear that's been deaf all the time do you realize this woman was standing there amen healed before oh god before she come in the prayer line she was already healed you say she was already healed brother zach then why didn't she come up with a good ear because there was a spirit hanging over her that would not let her fully go out yonder and believe she was healed there was a spirit i'm closing there was a spirit clamping that nerve there was a spirit shutting off her ear amen from here and what she should hear but she was already healed are you hearing me so when she stood before a prophet it was her opportunity for a breakthrough it was her opportunity to break through that spirit and go out yonder and fully believe the god that made the promise was their present to confirm the promise he says do you hear me can you hear me this was in the ear that's been death all the time do you hear me he says say a man why did he choose the word hallelujah why did he choose the word why did he choose the word thanksgiving why did he choose the word glory he chose the word amen because what does amen mean it means it's finished it means it's over it means it's settled it means jesus christ himself is the amen do you hear me do you hear me say amen i love this and you know what the sister says amen amen now it's not just a preacher who was sent with faith commissioned to preach the word of faith stand there saying amen he's a healer amen he's a deliverer amen he's a great physician but now her faith is contacted in another realm and now it's no longer just him saying it it's now her saying it i am healed do you hear me say amen i love this say i love the lord she says i love the lord say praise the lord she says praise the lord say jesus loves me jesus loves me say amen amen oh god y'all probably think i'm a crazy fanatic and that's all right amen i'm a fanatic for jesus amen i think we ought to have some life in this message i think if a woman that's been deaf her whole life amen can stand in the presence of a prophet and receive her healing then what about the church of the living god this morning are you hearing me amen i'll tell you what that devil's been doing he's been trying to cut off your hearing he's been trying to cut off your hearing what does the bible say amen he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit of god saith unto the churches and you know what when you hear something you can only repeat what you hear you know why you ain't living no more victory because the devil's cut off your hearing you ain't hearing no more but if that nerve if that nerve can come open to begin to hear the word again and you hear a preacher say you are victorious then you'll say i am victorious if you can hear a preacher say you are an overcomer then you'll say i am an overcomer are you hearing me what's happening the devil has lost his hold over you you broke through you broke through you broke through into a realm with god we're all things somebody say all things all things are possible the prophet says it this way he says if you can break through that prayer a faith breaks through he says see what it is how many knows daniel prayed 21 days the problem god said but the lord heard him the first time now watch this the angel says the prince let me let me just i'm i'm i'm closing right here then he said unto me fear not daniel for from the first day somebody say the first day thou did it set thy heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy god thy words were heard and i come for thy words but the prince of the kingdom of persia which withstood me one in 20 days but lo michael one of the chief princes came to help me and i remained there with the kings of persia he said listen i heard you i heard you the first time you prayed i heard you the first time you asked but i was withstood but i didn't give up and daniel did you didn't give up you prayed 21 days i fought 21. okay i stood there because i knew there was a breakthrough coming that's what the prophet says if the blessings placed on you hold steal if the blessings placed on you how many will raise your hand and say the blessings been placed on me if the blessing has been placed on your blander the blessing had been placed on me go read revelation 1 3 unto him that heareth and readeth there is a blessing if you just hear this prophecy and read this prophecy there's a blessing placed upon you sometimes it's days before it can get to you daniel prayed one time and the angel didn't get there for 21 days is that right he said i've seen the time where men and women would wait for weeks but the first thing you know here we go all at once it happened all at once it happened the angel passing through the neighborhood what are you saying i'm saying don't give up you're anointed to break through you're anointed to believe are you hearing me you know god still moves you believe that you believe god still moves no matter how long you've been carrying something in a matter of a moment while the words being preached you can be delivered from that thing forever back in april first night of our spring tent meetings here i was ministering wednesday night i didn't know there was a woman there who had been in a car wreck 20 years before that before that time 20 years brother bob she'd been in a car wreck she'd been carrying a fear of that car wreck for 20 years 20 years she'd been carried on the first night of that meeting while i was minister on the the attraction what is the attraction something's drawn you to it the spirit of god dropped down right there on the first night of that meeting and delivered that woman of that fear she'd been carrying for 20 years are you hearing me he's still the god of breakthroughs he still comes through you love him this evening let our musicians come listen church we're not looking for the mechanics he says we're looking for the dynamics of it he said we've got the mechanics of the religious of the bible so bottle eyes he says it looks like a great big 16 or 35 coach train sitting out here on a track he says but if you haven't got any steam in it it takes the dynamics somebody say dynamics to perform with the mechanics in desperations he says then at the end of the message you see the attraction see the action the whole the great holy spirit see him come down visible before people even take pictures of it see it working and showing that it's not a man it's not a preacher it's not a certain congregation it's the holy spirit showing the same thing it did when it was embodied in the body of jesus christ he says now notice him turn a corner now it's embodied in the body of his bride brother got all the brother andrew i think we're good with the mechanics okay well let's go today to dave and saul saul had all the mechanics right he had the armor he had the so he had everything but when goliath laid out his boast saul's armor broke down in the pressure of goliath's boast but david's dynamic experience stood there and said i've seen a bear come down i've seen a lion come down this uncircumcised philistine will come down as well are you hearing me he's the god of breakthroughs can i tell you something you come to church and sometimes you sit there and you think you know what i'm thinking my own thoughts ain't nobody hearing them i don't want to be here i'd rather be somewhere else and you're thinking all these thoughts let me just let you on a little secret god hears all the thoughts you're thinking can i share a little testimony with you back in 2018 we was out at brother mike walls doing a youth camp there it was on the the second night of that meeting it was outside under a shed and we was preaching and preaching the way we was having a good service you know how he's preaching preaching and there was liberty but all of a sudden a storm coming in when the storm come in it started lightening and thundering and pouring rain i mean rain was just poor and thankfully we was under a tent or under a shed and they they the a lightning struck hit and it went i mean when it hit i mean it was like it lit up the sky i was almost ready through the microphone so i thought if it strikes this microphone this got to have somewhere to go when i did the lightning struck and the power went out in the building i mean went totally out and god's my witness my wife was here when that happened that place went into an uproar i mean they were shouting they were screaming i looked back brother mike brother michael was just weep and he was just just rejoicing shaking the power of god and in the back of my mind i'm thinking how in the world did this happen how was i standing here preaching the power goes out and the service goes to another level well brother when i did i i thought the power was out so the powers out the mic ain't going to work when i did i heard this there's no light everything's pitch black but the microphone's still working i grabbed that microphone up i said god is still god his word is still i mean and the place went into another level priests man i'm talking about it was wide open preaching then i it was actually fun preaching then i mean it was just damn you know demons flying devils flying i mean the power of god roll it was a good meeting but i left there thinking and we and we saw mighty things happen but i left there thinking why did the power go out that service go another level i pick up the microphone and go to the we didn't stage these acts we didn't get out and plan this how did this happen and for years i've carried that in my mind of what happened until the other day i was back up there preaching that youth camp a few weeks ago and i got on the golf cart with a brother and he said brother andrew i need to thank you i said well you know i'm thinking back in my mind he's thanking me for coming so i said well you know god bless you brother thank you all for having us it's been good to be here well i appreciate you coming he said but i need to thank you for something more i said what's that he said does this name ring a bell he called this girl's name i said brother i'm sorry it don't he said well let me tell you who that is that's my daughter he said and if you'll recall a few years ago when you as you're preaching the power went out he said and you you laid the microphone down and you picked it back up i said yes sir he said my daughter was sitting there running from the lord he said she didn't even want to be there he said she had said there is nothing to serving god there is nothing to living for him she he said she was sitting there and she said these words she said god if you're real prove yourself to me and if you're not then let something happen and let that preacher shut up that's what she said let that preacher shut up i'm tired of hearing him he said and no more than she said that he said the power went out and these were her next words well right there goes to prove he can't preach now the microphone don't even work he said and you picked it back up and you said god is god he said my daughter fell right there under the conviction the holy ghost said she surrendered her heart to god receive the holy ghost said this is her testimony she wasn't even wanting to hear the word but the preacher kept on preaching are you hearing me that girl's still serving god today he's the god of breakthroughs church don't give up amen keep on preaching though there's obstacles keep on preaching though the service is quiet somebody keep on pulling and before long you will pull a breakthrough in the church and there'll be a victory like you've never seen before there'll be an outpouring like you've never seen before it's still in the word won't you stand your feet with us this evening he's still god his word is still true his power is still here he's still given the holy ghost he's still casting out devils what is he he's the god of breakthroughs he's the god of breakthroughs you know sometimes the problem of god said like this he said wow look at this quote god is here this afternoon that's his direct statement he says god in expectation 54 well now look god is here this afternoon now we've got to follow the law of god he said the law of god is one accord love one for the other he said see how am i he says there you are one accord everybody under expectations that god's going to pour down this power listen you know it's here scientifically you know it's here lookie here how could miss waldrop be sitting here dying with cancer how many across the world are the thousands times thousands of cases listen how could you a drunkard a few weeks ago or a few months ago and a gentleman this afternoon how could you a street harlot a few weeks ago and the lady this afternoon by the transforming power of god being transmitted by the holy ghost into your heart changed your nature changed your making it made you another person is that right you might have not felt it now i don't know about that but it's here anyhow are you hearing me orlando i don't feel it but it's here anyhow whether you feel it or not let's give god thanks for it it's here anyhow whether you feel it or not let's give god thanks it's here just the same whether you feel this transforming power or not that don't matter sis it's here the same then watch a prophet turn and says now watch this he says there's streaks going through this room right now he says do you feel them he said you don't feel them he said you know why because they're they're ordained to be picked up by televisions he said the television picks it up ain't been that streak flashing can i finish this over that okay he said that that streak flashing through here it'll fly brother it'll go right by you and you won't feel nothing you know why because you weren't ordained to pick it up but it goes by television and a television grabs it and displays the picture he said see now it's the same way here he said if our body was magnetized like that he says to one word he says that word is yes somebody say that word yes say it loud yes see stretched out from the window this window it's sweeping through the building it's going right through you and somebody's saying yes on the radio he says well it comes right through as it goes through them the powers that forth it goes through your body now when it hits against the crystal it catches it and you see the television say yes oh god when the television catches the word yes it'll say yes when the radio catches the word yes it'll say yes he said now if god up there if god up there said by his stripes you were healed the holy ghost entwines brings that down by the power of god your heart is set on that it says yes by his stripes we are healed mark 11 24 yes lord i believe the meetings on the road he said then stand there like that till the power of god comes down and when it hits it says yes and then the next man says yes look then you got double power of yes amen then triple power then four times power of yes then the first thing you know then the first thing you know it becomes thousands of powers of yes then the holy spirit moves in and confirms the word with signs and wonders follow and that's it when you just give yourself to the word oh church can i show you how this works amen let somebody stand up and say god is a healer and brother wade says yes and brother aaron says and brother lewis says
