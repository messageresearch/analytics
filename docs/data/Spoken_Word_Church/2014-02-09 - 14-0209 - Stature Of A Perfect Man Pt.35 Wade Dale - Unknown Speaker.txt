========================================

we're ready to go now all right good to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen good to see each and every one of you Full House patience we were talking about patience last Sunday and uh we really didn't get down much too patient but uh we just got to have patience to get down to Patient we're patiently waiting but remember patient let's we don't have to turn to it can y'all see it over there you see it okay can y'all see it back there okay everybody see it all right for your older ones in the back old up front too oh joy yeah the older one in the back oh she said me huh today no how about being old somebody just had birthday who this one of y'all okay Joor we're the same age for just a little while all right just a little while 54 now I don't look 54 I look a lot younger than that Joyce now with the other hand look out patience with God remember yeah patience patience with the people so yeah we're 54 now so I um the other day I was thinking kind of funny but Jun and I do surveys online and E rewards does a survey well most of the time the survey begins with what's your birthday or what's your age and they have a bracketed age it's not exactly they want you know from 44 to 49 and then from 50 to 54 well next year I'll be in that 55 to 60 bracket that they have out there and I'm like man no I don't want to do that anyway but it's the Lord ter I want to have another birthday you know I I want gey to continue to be older than me for a little while anyway but second Peter verse one let's read the scripture and get started according as he hath according as his divine power ha given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness so that's what we were talking about and last week we spoke a good bit on life and Temperance listen it's just a journey and it's it's it's something that Peter didn't get like overnight he worked on it uh the very one that says being born again Peter did there Being Born Again by The Incorruptible word of God the problem with a lot of people because you see that scripture says Being Born Again by The Incorruptible word of God see a lot of people are listening to corruptable word and you can't get perfected by corruptible word it has to be The Incorruptible word of God so you've got to figure out where the corruptible word is and where The Incorruptible word is and thereby I don't think you can go up the statute of a perfect man with corruptible word cuz it's the statue of a perfect man it's making it's you know the five-fold ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints is to make you perfect or complete so you have to make that choice where that is through the knowledge of him that ha called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and virtue knowledge and knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness we'll stop right there and then you want godl brotherly kindness then we looked at the word the word patience means enduring the last one is the one I want that we really a patient enduring you see those ings that's an ongoing process enduring Paul says running the race enduring to the end sustaining how you going to get sustained sitting at home not coming to church sitting at home not listening to the prophet or listening to you know brother Dale or who or whoever you know to get your sustaining uh you know we we fill our bellies up every day uh what about our spiritual belly that's right you know I mean that's but see that has a lot to do with patience cuz everybody wants this everybody wants this remember I told you that power without character is satanic you may have the power you the new birth is the power of God Bible says the power of God under salvation all right so there's the power of God you have the power of God at the new birth but not saying that you're that brother R wasn't saying that you're satanic if you try to use the gift but that power without character you're going to always use wrong because you're going to lean to your that's right virtue your knowledge human your Temperance which short fuse long fuse it doesn't matter when the bomb goes off it's the same thing that's right it's a mess if it's a short right if it's a short fuse or a long fuse when the bomb goes off it's a mess so it really doesn't matter whether you have a short fuse or a long fuse we were born with a fuse right and we've got to sustain and perseverance perseverance is just keep on keep going and and keep fighting man this is a battle you know that you're not just going to get up at statute of a perfect man just by who you are that's right okay or your Birthright except for one that's the new birth right all right but not by your own doings right have long patience bear long suffer long be longsuffering patiently endure to be of a long Spirit not to lose heart that's what happens remember the car remember the the seed that was sewn remember the seed was sewn the plant came up but the Bible says it withered and and and blew away because it didn't take root remember the winds come by and blew it away right what they do they let the world and the things of the world get a hold of them be of long Spirit not to lose heart to persevere patiently and bravely in enduring misfortunes and troubles and I'm sure we all can attain to that to be patient in bearing the offenses and injuries of others right cuz we're going to read in a minute first thing brother Brown said to be patient with was God then patient with there's no way that you you need to be patient of yourself you know what you are but you have to be patient with others right you know you can make yourself mad you understand what I'm saying but that's okay to me I don't mind you know if you say you big dummy but when you call Brother Bob a big dummy that's the difference you understand what I mean I mean you call yourself hey why' you do that you know dummy or whatever you that's yourself but be patient with a brother when he makes the same mistake you made do you say hey big dummy to him you know or her or whatever you put the word in there you want to be patient in bearing the offenses and injuries of others it's wonderful to have patience with somebody when they're the same as you are that's right but when they're contrary to you that's where the patience comes in cuz remember Jesus told us the greatest commandment was to love our neighbor as ourselves and then love our brother as ourselves you know that's hard to do it I mean we all love oursel but can you love somebody that's contrary to you as much as you do yourself had an experience yesterday and I I'll tell you about it next Sunday we won't talk about it today but um uh it's just something that that come to my heart that uh an experience just for me nobody else nobody else knew about it just for me but you got to realize these things and you got to see that that what you got to do is is you got to Bear brother what did Brother R say now brother Brown what if he prayer line would have come up and he would have said oh there's nothing wrong with you just a little bit of this and that going he took every case and he was patient he analyzed every case you're from certain certain Town you're from here he saw the whole thing going on he could have just said you got cancer no he was he was getting an atmosphere he was he was being patient what brother Brown say that woman did that uh they had the baby she prayed for the baby he said that mother entered in she entered into the spirit of that other mother to pray for the baby that's why you sisters when we have somebody come up for prayer and and they stay long in the in the sanctuary you need to go up there and pray with them cuz you know I can't pray for an infirmary you have as a female that I don't have and that don't mean just female trouble that means y'all are just wired different than us Lord Jacob and I were talking about the other day about about um he's been married a year now and um he's figuring out the wiring ain't the same and uh you be put it out for long he says they're just different I said I told you that before you got married they're just and you are but you know what you can enter into that I've never been a mother so if my B if a baby's sick you can enter into that okay but that's being patient bearing the offense in other words bearing the burden of others all right be patient and and injuries of others to be mild and slow to punish and you shall be hated of all men here we go with some scriptures you should be hated of all men for my name's sake but there shall not a hair of your head perish in your patience possess ye your soul all right you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake you'd think that was probably Temperance but that's patience is having patience on who God to do what he said he do remember you come to this analogy and the analogy is that that you may be called up before government we may be called up before government I mean the Bible says we might but said if you're called up before government in other words don't sit down the day before and study what you're going to say right cuz you're going to get it wrong you're going to do your own thing you understand what I'm saying but in patience you sit there and wait on God he said I'll tell you what to say I'll tell you what to say well see when he tells you what to say then what we do we have patience we wait on the Lord they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength then now Romans 5 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into his grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in Tribulation H Paul should know that shouldn't he Yeah that poor old guy was beat and stoned and they about own him to death one time and they beat him with u you know 39 lashes or whatever it was that before right before he killed him and nobody liked that guy but you know what he didn't he didn't spend half the Bible lashing out at his critics right he didn't right I mean he would make little Snippets and say Hey you know you this or this or this this but he didn't spend a whole lot of time well bless God you know even David we were reading there you look David said my en my enemies have compassed me my enemies have done but I Look to You Lord I Look to You Lord and he didn't even have a new birth he just had patience in with God because of his because of his U countenance his his demeanor and patience wait and not only but we glory in Tribulation know that tribulation worketh patience so you're going to have to go through let me warn you if you hadn't already you're going to go through tribulation to find out if you got patience right all right so you're going to it's going to happen and patience experience and experience hope so there's a there's a a broad range of of what's going on here with patience cuz to me patience is a key because look how close you're getting up in the pyramid you know you're up number four there in patience and man you're right there at godliness and then brotherly kindness so you're packing it in but I think patience to me just to me personally Temperance and Patience are the two things that are key because they're right there in the middle you know it's kind of like the U kind of like going to you know you got first quarter second quarter halftime and then in halftime you prepare everything for the next two quarters you know so we're preparing if you got Temperance in patience that's preparing you to propel you on up to Godliness and brotherly kindness because you know you run well you virtue knowledge is good make virtue knowledge but you got to have Temperance what I'm saying knowledge knowledge is kind of you can get that on your what you understand what I'm saying you can get that on in other words you can experience stuff for yourself you can read the word of God yourself but now Temperance is around you that's right what's around you that's right you got it not is you and God that's right you understand what I'm saying yes virtue is you and God but it goes out to other people that's right but now Temperance is coming back at you right patience is coming back at you that's right but see godliness and brotherly kindness then though is what goes out from you so you see what I'm saying God starts you real slow and he says okay I'm going to work on you and I'm going to give you virtue going to come out now knowledge is going to come out cuz it's what I give you but now Temperance and patience is what's going to bombard you this way right it's what's going to come in here and beat you to death that's right then see godliness is what you portray out brotherly kindness is what you portray out love is what you portray out so to me Temperance and patience is kind of a key in there that you're going to be tested and tried okay go ahead it's kind of like the Soul and Spirit is hardly separable correct that is correct one one of the other it's really Temperance and patience to me are the ones that are so close together you can call them both because even it says right there that in patience possess you your soul you know and all these things in patience Temperance and patience like I said they they go really hand in hand because it's what happens to you externally if you ever thought about that look at the statute of perfect man faith is an internal work virtue is an internal work that shows out right you got to have virtue before it can go out knowledge you got to have knowledge before it can go out but now temperance is somebody what they're doing to you patience is what somebody's doing to you now godliness is what you got going out cuz you're showing to be like God right and then brotherly kindness It's what you show that's right it's not what they're doing it's what you're doing Temperance and patience to me though is the key we we really you know we spend a good bit of time on Temperance but we can flip-flop back and forth with Temperance and patience and not just be P listen being patient is not just something somebody like Sister Barbara that's just human she's just got human patience you understand what I mean she's got Godly patience I believe but inside of her is just a patience that for her to work with the children she works with and for her to be around a bunch of us loud mouth and be able to control herself and be able to you know and you understand what I mean you understand I mean and and look at all the situations in her life and you know she's just not it's justness just just a calm you know and there and I enjoy that I really do I wish I was that way a lot of times but and y'all do too I'm sure we can all say Amen together amen okay brother brand said though that you can have all of the sure just have them not not even have Godly y have be that time first what you need is Godly wisdom to operate the knowledge why if you look if you look at the pope he would seem Godly read scriptures every day you understand what I mean he he he he doesn't drink smoke cuss never had a wife all these things you'd think well he's he's the closest to Jesus but yet he's the absolute Antichrist so here we go you got to show it a little bit better than than what the pope said but like I've always said these are these are virtues that that reflect back from the word of God you know it's got to be it's got to come from the word it's got to be a revelation it's got to be a um a change yes it's got to be a change and you can't go to any motivational seminar you can't get it preached into you you can get it preached and then you receive it but brother Bram said you know preach patience till they get patience you just keep preaching it and the people somewhere they click and everybody's not going to get it at the same time we've been through the statute of a perfect man here at this church three or four times and every time we go over it maybe it'll Jack us up up to a higher level and make us a little bit more aware cuz all I can do is make you aware that you got a problem yes and I got a problem I'm just making you aware of that you know the Lord's going to to say hey this is where you need to work on it at and it's going to come from experience right all this is going to be experiened cuz remember we read the scripture says life and godliness so it's life and what you do in your Christian Life we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence and what's that perseverance diligence and perseverance is the same thing cuz look at us we've been here now 50 years almost since brother Brown's been gone 25th thing will be 50 years the prophet will be gone 50 years and we're still here got people that can't even understand things out there that you know you preach to them and they look at you like with a blank look on their face and it's something that there in this church we amen and know what the preacher is talking about you understand what I'm saying yes so you but you got to have patience yes God did yes he had patience with you so he's got to so we got to have patience with others that's right you know everybody can't get to the same level and everybody can't do the same thing you do amen we're all different and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence so we got to show it right to the full Assurance of hopeing to the end let's keep on going that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises and boy was Abraham one of them now Abraham waited 25 years and he got worse it wasn't like God came to him at at 15 years old and said you're going to have a child and then here he is you know 30 or 45 or whatever I'm still have kute no he come to him at 75 and he was finally he was able to have one like Dad has been talking about you know with Hagar but not the promised child and then he had to wait on a little bit further he had to wait on so it was totally impossible for Abraham to have any thought in his mind that he can naturally produce this baby that's the same thing God wants with these virtues when you can't humanly produce them right when you can't humanly produce them that's when God says okay I'll give them to you now right when you can't humanly because remember when you humanly produce it it's like what Mom said when you humanly produce it it's just it's just you living a good virtuous life yes a lot of people live good virtuous life there's a lot of people's going to come up to the Lord remember in the scripture and says have I not done this and this and this and this and this and this cast out devils and spoke in tongues and preach the gospel and all these things he said depart from you I never knew you in other words you were built on your own ability and not mine all right for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after after he had patiently endured now God may come down and give you a promise just like that but most of the time you know if you're going to have patience you got to wait for something that's right right he obtained the promise Hebrews 12:1 let's get we got the scriptures last week let's get through them and get to a couple of quotes wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness excuse me let us lay aside every weight huh lay aside every weight in a sin which does so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us James 1 my brethren count it all joy when you fall into many Temptation knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh worketh t ongoing worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that she may be perfect and entire wanting nothing James 5:7 be patient therefore Brethren un the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman waiteth now who's the husbandman Christ Jesus Christ waiteth for me and you to grow up right Ain that what it's saying it's waiting for me and you to grow up well because we're the fruit on the vine right for the precious fruit of the earth and have long patience for it until we receive the early latter rain which we know we're in all we're in the latter rain now the Harvest part be ye also patient James 5 establish your heart for the coming of the Lord draweth not now that was 2,000 years ago what about today Grudge not one against another Brethren lest you be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering Affliction and of patience behold we count them happy which endure you have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and tender of tender Mercy now let's read here statute of perfect man paragraph 228 when your knowledge is like his knowledge I come to do thy will on God say with the father's word he defeated every devil Heaven and Earth will pass away but the word will not see when you got that kind of knowledge it'll vulcanize with your faith when you got the right kind of temperance like he had it'll vulcanize if you haven't just a man-made halfway sou up belief or Temperance oh I slap him down but maybe I better not cuz they might put my name in the paper about it how many of us are guilty of that H silence in the room I didn't hear somebody said no no was me I a never thought about doing that wellow you're L that ain't that ain't the kind of temperance he's talking about don't try to add that it won't work but when you can really with a sweetness from your heart forgive every man hold your peace shut up Let it Be Gone see then it'll vulcanize see let it be gone in other words Let It Go all right didn't Paul tell us one time that we wrestle to our own destruction somebody somebody in in the New Testament said we wrestle we wrestle with things we can't do one thing about that's right nothing I can't save my kids but I can try to have enough virtue that one day they'll catch a hold of it that's all you can do you can add that to your faith one day I'm going to have to help Daddy on that cuz when he says W ew he goes we that's not we that's our brother R go you hear on tap he go no listen the no wonder the church is so short isn't that right no wonder I'd say repent and be baptized Bible says the name of Jesus Christ and strict TR trinitarian don't believe that said that Antichrist he did Jesus name he's Jesus only Look Out Boy I don't know about your Temperance right now see he's linking Temperance and patience almost right here together of course they are together but watch him right here was brother R let's reason this together I'd like to hear this explain see then come down and listen to it then it's put right before you and then you walk away well get to that just in a few minutes in godliness but when you fly loose want to jump at every conclusion now that's not having patience right that's right that's not having Temperance our patience that's right all right that's not it see you haven't got Bible Temperance yet when you do that how to answer back then if you got all this you can add this to your faith now he gets into it then fourthly we'll read a couple quotes and then we'll go upstairs a little bit full today so we'll get up there and not stir around so much then after that fourthly you want to add patience to your faith if you've got faith it work as patience the Bible says so this is patience now that's the next thing is going to build this stature you know God has got real material in his building see how short we are brother sisters see see why where we're at yes sir we have Glory we've had that for 50 years we have shouts and things we've had that 50 years because we got faith we've got power this is the power right and then with the message man that's the power of God all right what are we doing with it though are we just having faith cuz right here he says we have Glory we have shouts and things because we got faith so we got to New Birth he said we got faith faith is New Birth right but when we come down to these things here God can't build us into that stature see he can't he can't well yeah God can no God can't do what you won't let him do that's right that's right he won't override I mean even though you got faith and got the new birth he's timid he's not going to override your freem moral agency he's not going to he's not going to say I'm just going to give you patience no that's contrary to the Bible that's right all right that's why I believe that and and Buster will probably see this but the brother cross here in this church over here that's what he said when he told me he been he's been watching these and he said I thought you got them when you was born again he said it that's not he said that's contrary to the Bible in other words he said I see you have to add these afterwards well he's he's trying to get them and that's good that's good get them into a you know get them into a shape where they can receive something you know um we understand that could be in a different group you know different group who virgin or whatever but when we come down to these things God can't build us into that stature see he can't he can't make us up to that kind of place we got all these other things we fall slide off it see he can't build his church why can't he build his church he said he was going to cuz somebody's going to right somebody's going to take it and go with it all right now brother R says patience with what this is paragraph 233 statute of perfect man what kind of patience first thing is have patience with God if you got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because Faith work patience When God says anything you believe it that's all you got patience that's right but now then we go and start trying to figure stuff out all right say well I asked him last night to heal me and I'm just as sick tomorrow oh my what patience I run past my quote God told Abraham and 25 years later there wasn't even one sign he was still believe beling he was patient with God uh-huh put him always before you let him be the next Crossing thing you can't cross him so just keep him before you he said so it's going to happen so keep him before you that's right Noah had patience Noah had real Godly patience God said I'm going to destroy the world with rain and Noah preached 125 years plenty of patience not even DW fell from heaven was it nothing see it's not that it's rain the there was no such thing as rain and we must we must use this analogy the same way with there's never been a body change like you listen to what I'm saying like we're taking today so when we talk about a body change it's just like Noah telling the people it's going to rain if you tell somebody you're going to take a body change they go right what we going have a body change you know nominal people and even people in the message yeah we're going to have a body change but how do you get there you got to know how to get there plenty of patience not even DW fell from heaven wasn't nothing just as Dusty It Ever Was for 120 years but he was patient then God tries your patience after he told that's right God tries them now what happened what happened with old Noah it we stop right here what happened with Noah he preached 120 years finally he got all the animals in the ark God told him to go in the ark God shut the door did it start raining right then seven days they sat in that Ark got worse and worse symptoms got worse you probably could hear hear him out there say oh no what's wrong is they going to rain you hear rocks probably throwing rocks you know a bunch of unbelievers he told no I said no I want you to go ahead and get in the ark I'm going to run the animals in there and I want you to get in climb up way upstairs now so you can look out top window I want you to get in there I want you to tell these people tomorrow what I've been preaching for 120 years is going to take place all right you go down there and tell them we'll stop right there but you remember what happened M remember his daughter comes up says Noah what daughter-in-law said Noah what it's going to rain 7 days he had to wait inside that Ark but you know what no one knew that if God shut that door see you that's what you got to look at little experiences Noah couldn't physically shut that door itself that's right so if God shut the door it was going to happen that's right it's going to happen so it's going to happen that's right the body change is going to happen we just got to be able to get there so we'll start start right here next Sunday Lord bless you get up be quiet and easy going upstairs
