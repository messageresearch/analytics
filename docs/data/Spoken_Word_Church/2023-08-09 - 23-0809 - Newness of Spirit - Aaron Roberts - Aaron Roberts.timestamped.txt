[17:56] you and to your hands in the name of
[17:58] Jesus Christ amen
[18:01] amen Romans 7.
[18:03] one says no you're not brethren for I
[18:06] speak to them that know the law how that
[18:08] the law hath dominion over a man as long
[18:11] as he liveth for the woman which ath and
[18:14] husband is bound by the law to her
[18:17] husband so long as he liveth but if the
[18:20] husband be dead she is loose from the
[18:22] law of her husband
[18:24] so then if while her husband liveth she
[18:27] be married to another man she shall be
[18:29] called an adulteress but if her husband
[18:31] be dead she is free from the wall so
[18:35] that she is no adulteress though she be
[18:37] married to another man therefore my
[18:39] brethren wherefore my brethren ye also
[18:41] are become dead to the law by the body
[18:44] of Christ that you should be married to
[18:46] another even to him who is raised from
[18:49] the dead that we should bring forth
[18:51] fruit unto God for when we were in the
[18:54] flesh the Motions of sin which were by
[18:56] the law did work in our members to bring
[18:59] forth fruit unto death but now we are
[19:01] delivered from the law that being dead
[19:03] wherein
[19:04] we were held that we should serve in
[19:07] newness of spirit and not in the oldness
[19:10] of the letter
[19:12] amen well God bless you you may be
[19:14] seated
[19:17] and I just want to
[19:20] look at a few things tonight
[19:27] and this is from the
[19:29] the
[19:29] from the message
[19:31] Elijah
[19:34] in 1953
[19:37] and uh
[19:40] brother Brandon says let me tell you
[19:42] something brother America is loaded down
[19:44] with that Tommy rot
[19:46] he said we've got all they got
[19:49] on the programs in the radio time and
[19:52] everything sold as such as that because
[19:54] they got the sway of the world that's
[19:56] right he said why the Gospel of Jesus
[19:58] Christ ought to be preached in its power
[20:01] and men and women born again and come
[20:03] away from such stuff as that and live
[20:05] for God
[20:07] he said let me tell you something
[20:08] brother you say now brother Branham
[20:10] we're going to you're going to teaching
[20:14] about morals
[20:16] you just get that old-fashioned baptism
[20:19] of the Holy Ghost and you'll find out
[20:20] what God will do for you
[20:25] it says you say
[20:27] well I have to quit smoking brother
[20:28] Benham to get the baptism of the Holy
[20:30] Ghost
[20:31] he said listen when Springtime comes we
[20:33] live here in this country
[20:35] there's a lot of little old scrub Oaks
[20:38] you know it is around here it's got
[20:41] leaves all year round they're hanging on
[20:44] you know right now they'll hang on until
[20:46] next spring now when Springtime comes
[20:49] you don't have to go out and pick all
[20:52] the old leaves off am I just let the new
[20:54] life come
[20:55] up and the old Leaf drops off he said
[21:00] just get down here at the altar and stay
[21:03] this Tuesday until God fills your heart
[21:06] with the Holy Ghost and you won't have
[21:09] any more time for that kind of stuff you
[21:11] won't have to preach against it or
[21:13] nothing it'll take care of itself
[21:17] and I just want to look at a few things
[21:20] tonight because
[21:23] one of the the things
[21:29] here in the scripture you know
[21:33] Paul's writing to the
[21:35] to the Romans and you know he's talking
[21:37] about the oldness
[21:39] the old man the old things that were and
[21:42] and when he was writing about this
[21:45] typing it as like marriage and divorce
[21:48] but when he was talking about when that
[21:50] when the old man has passed away
[21:53] then you come into a newness
[21:56] and you don't and so when that old man
[21:58] is passed away
[22:00] when that old Union has passed away then
[22:04] you walk in newness of life there's an
[22:07] As Romans 6 tells us we walk in newness
[22:10] of life if we've been buried in baptism
[22:12] with Christ and rose again just as
[22:15] heroes from the dead than we raise with
[22:17] him then we are to raise and walk in
[22:19] newness of life and here here he is
[22:22] speaking that when that old nature when
[22:25] that old
[22:26] Union that we had has passed away then
[22:30] you know what we are to walk in newness
[22:32] of life
[22:33] and you know when I was
[22:37] speaking on in the Sunday School Sunday
[22:39] morning and
[22:40] you know um
[22:42] I was thinking about what brother
[22:45] uh I hope brother Ryan don't mind but
[22:48] um you know he was he had asked that
[22:50] question and you know
[22:52] when you know you begin to realize that
[22:55] when when God begins to deal with you
[23:00] when you when you see where you've come
[23:02] from
[23:03] when you know what what you were
[23:06] and where you come from today
[23:09] when you when you see you know everybody
[23:12] well I gotta wait to a certain point no
[23:15] if you realize who you are
[23:18] when you come because you know I was I
[23:21] you know I don't have I didn't you know
[23:24] somebody don't have to tell me that you
[23:26] know I had this I had this great seed in
[23:28] me I was a gene seed of God yes but you
[23:31] know what I was lost I was alienated
[23:34] from the life of God I was doomed and on
[23:36] my way to hell
[23:37] now anybody can everybody can try to
[23:39] stand up you know throw their shoulder
[23:41] out trying to Pat theirself on the back
[23:43] tell them about how great they were and
[23:44] who they came from and and all that kind
[23:46] of stuff but you know I know who I was
[23:50] and I knew what I needed
[23:52] I needed salvation
[23:55] I knew I needed a a whole change I I
[24:00] needed I needed a new birth I had I had
[24:02] to go through a change and something had
[24:04] to take place in me
[24:06] because I know who the old man was
[24:09] and you know when you when you when you
[24:12] come from that and you understand who
[24:13] you were and when you come to the place
[24:16] that you know there was a day
[24:19] and I can still remember getting down
[24:21] the first time brother wait I can still
[24:23] remember getting down on my knees and
[24:25] praying through
[24:27] because you know I told God I can't live
[24:29] like this anymore there come a time
[24:31] where you know what I was tired of the
[24:33] old man
[24:34] I'm tired of living that old thing that
[24:37] old way that trying to fight the old
[24:39] battle I'm not dealing with that anymore
[24:41] and because you know what because God in
[24:44] the grace of God had come to me and he
[24:46] was drawing me I didn't go looking for
[24:48] him he came looking for me and when he
[24:51] became well and he came looking for me I
[24:53] wanted I wanted what he had what he was
[24:56] offering I wanted to accept that
[24:59] and when I when I began to you know I
[25:01] couldn't but you know what there was
[25:02] come a day sister there come a day when
[25:05] when I got down and I prayed through but
[25:07] you know what I didn't I didn't get the
[25:09] relief that I was looking for I didn't
[25:10] get that that moment
[25:12] but you know I put I put my confidence
[25:14] in God I put my faith in with my calls
[25:16] that's what he told me to do he told me
[25:18] if I would would confess my my sins he
[25:23] said he is faithful and just to forgive
[25:25] me and to cleanse me from all
[25:26] unrighteousness now that's what he said
[25:28] I didn't do it all I had to do is take
[25:31] him at his word but you know what there
[25:32] was a day that I received a revelation
[25:34] that you know I realized I come to a
[25:37] realization that my sins were gone
[25:41] now you know what the devil could bring
[25:43] up all he wanted to and look back hey
[25:45] let's let's pull up all of the old
[25:47] pictures and all the old memories and
[25:49] let's go through all that but you know
[25:51] what thank God God don't remember that
[25:53] anymore
[25:54] all of that was as far as is in the sea
[25:57] of forgetfulness as the song says as far
[26:00] as darkness is from dawn
[26:03] why because all of that was gone for me
[26:06] I didn't have to deal but you know what
[26:07] I still had to battle that same old
[26:09] devil that same old nature was still
[26:12] there but praise God I did receive one
[26:15] thing I did know that my sins were
[26:17] forgiven
[26:19] but you know what that started me on my
[26:22] journey
[26:23] and you know what I could walk in
[26:24] newness of light
[26:27] and newness of spirit
[26:29] why because you know what I didn't have
[26:31] to worry about that
[26:33] now I still thought the same I still had
[26:35] the same desires I still thought the
[26:37] same Devils I still thought about those
[26:40] things but you know what I was starting
[26:42] my journey I had a journey to begin and
[26:45] you know what I stopped and you know the
[26:46] thing is is you know everybody's looking
[26:48] for a
[26:50] a Deliverance
[26:52] well you know what Deliverance will come
[26:53] but you know sometimes the problem is is
[26:55] we don't want we don't want to be
[26:57] separate from the devil we don't want to
[26:59] be separate from the things of the world
[27:01] we don't want to be separate from all
[27:02] the carnal things that we had that we've
[27:04] towed it around for so long
[27:09] foreign
[27:11] but sometimes that's what it takes
[27:13] you've got to you've got to put a conch
[27:14] make a conscious effort you've got to
[27:16] step forward and say listen I'm not
[27:18] going to there anymore
[27:20] you know like I was telling you
[27:23] with with music you know country music
[27:26] you know I got rid all you know I got
[27:27] rid of all the CDs
[27:29] everything that I had
[27:32] well because you know I was getting
[27:33] ready I had that that was that was my
[27:36] life
[27:39] I mean I was y'all y'all don't know how
[27:43] much I was I was absorbed in country
[27:46] music
[27:49] and so you know I mean Richard Richard
[27:51] can tell you I mean I knew I knew
[27:52] songwriters I knew all kinds of artists
[27:55] I knew I mean it was just like this I
[27:57] was this encyclopedia I mean I was just
[27:59] I was everything about it
[28:01] and you know it was just all I mean
[28:03] everything just fascinated me I just
[28:06] but you know time to get rid of all that
[28:09] you know all all the memorabilia get rid
[28:12] of the shirts the CDs posters you know
[28:16] everything that you wow you got to get
[28:17] rid of all that because you can't have a
[28:20] little bit here and a little stick it in
[28:21] the closet and try to hang on to it no
[28:23] it's time to get rid of all that
[28:26] you don't need you don't need any of
[28:28] that all that stuff from your past
[28:29] life's got to go
[28:32] 513 trash you know
[28:36] sell it whatever get rid of it
[28:39] because it because you know what you
[28:41] still have the desire but the thing is
[28:43] is you got to get rid of all that
[28:46] you know I had a had a friend of mine
[28:49] his his brother
[28:51] he he was such an alcoholic
[28:55] and you know he said he said he'd go to
[28:57] church and he'd pray through and he'd
[28:59] come home he'd throw all his alcohol
[29:00] away
[29:02] and he said well I got Deliverance
[29:05] and he said then next thing you know
[29:07] he'd be sneaking out back he'd be trying
[29:09] to get what he could find in the in the
[29:11] trash can
[29:12] and get it out
[29:14] or he's going back to the store to buy
[29:16] some more
[29:19] why and you know because it's like well
[29:21] I'm trying to get rid of it well that's
[29:23] good
[29:25] but you know what you got to realize I
[29:27] don't have Deliverance that that Devil's
[29:29] still there
[29:31] but you still got to try to get rid of
[29:33] that
[29:33] still fight that battle and you know
[29:35] what if you fall
[29:37] well you know what I never I never I
[29:39] just didn't start right I just I just
[29:42] just wasn't it just wasn't called to
[29:44] this because I can't overcome it
[29:47] but you know what if you're in if you've
[29:49] come to a state of justification and you
[29:51] be and the Lord begins to deal with you
[29:52] in sanctification you know you've still
[29:55] got a struggle you still gotta fight and
[29:57] if you fall down you know what you fall
[30:00] down and what I was thinking to that
[30:02] quote on the on the way to church
[30:04] tonight you know brother Brandon was
[30:06] talking about uh
[30:07] he says it several times but you know he
[30:09] says um if if I if I fail
[30:13] or if I sin
[30:15] um he said let me rise and try again he
[30:18] said forgive me Lord and try me one more
[30:20] time
[30:22] what you know if you fall down well then
[30:24] you know what it's still the grace of
[30:26] God that started you on your journey is
[30:28] this grace of God is keeping you on your
[30:29] journey and you know you just can't quit
[30:31] just because you fall down just because
[30:33] you because you go you have a
[30:36] a shortcoming
[30:39] hey he's on you know because it's
[30:41] everybody even even if you're born again
[30:43] you know what you're still going to cook
[30:45] you're still gonna fall you're still
[30:46] going to commit sin you're still going
[30:48] to have problems
[30:51] I know you're still going all the way
[30:53] this struggle you know what you still
[30:54] gotta fight
[30:56] but you know what I you know because
[30:58] when you start on that Journey they say
[31:00] well I'm not where I ought to be I'm not
[31:01] where I want to be well that's true but
[31:03] you know what praise God you're not
[31:05] where you used to be because you've
[31:06] actually started on this journey you've
[31:09] actually started moving forward then you
[31:11] can say well praise God because now
[31:13] you're in the fight
[31:14] now you're pushing forward and if you
[31:17] come to this place and praise God I'm
[31:19] gonna keep fighting I'm gonna keep
[31:20] fighting if I fail then you know what
[31:22] I'm gonna stay in the word and I'm gonna
[31:23] eat on the word and I'm going to
[31:25] continue to Feast on it until it becomes
[31:28] something inside of me that I can
[31:30] overcome with not just not just some
[31:32] idea but you know you still gotta fight
[31:34] he just you just can't give up
[31:37] and you keep finding in one of these
[31:39] days you know what it's you know because
[31:41] now some people have this have this to
[31:43] happen to them you know what everything
[31:45] that they all of a sudden everything
[31:46] goes they're just over you know and you
[31:49] know what some of us it's one thing at a
[31:51] time
[31:53] you know people people give up smoking
[31:56] and you know what or they give up
[31:57] drinking they can't give up smoking they
[31:59] have this problem and they have that
[32:00] problem and they're trying to get over
[32:01] this and they're trying to get over that
[32:03] but you know what it's still the work of
[32:05] the Holy Ghost
[32:06] and as you begin to all of a sudden you
[32:08] know what you you see the work is taking
[32:11] place
[32:14] and then when you stop to say you know
[32:15] what I've overcome this why because by
[32:18] the grace of God I've overcome well you
[32:19] know what you continue to overcome but
[32:21] you can't get you just can't stop
[32:23] because the devil's gonna say you
[32:25] thought you had that you thought you had
[32:26] the victory you thought you had the
[32:27] victory you thought you had the victory
[32:30] but you know what you keep fighting
[32:33] amen why because you're you just you
[32:36] just got to keep plugging and pressing
[32:37] forward so what have you thought out get
[32:40] up
[32:40] keep going
[32:44] why because you start to say well you
[32:46] know what devil you had me on this and
[32:47] I've overcome and you had me on that and
[32:49] I've overcome and I've had this and I've
[32:51] overcome you see all the things that you
[32:52] can't hold me back on anymore
[32:55] why because the Lord has brought you
[32:57] this far and all of a sudden you know
[32:59] what you realize you know what you've
[33:01] come to the place that you've come to
[33:02] sanctification well you can see the Holy
[33:05] Ghost has done a work in you and you
[33:07] begin to change
[33:09] but you know what you can't stop there
[33:11] when you've laid all these things down
[33:13] and you realize you know what you're
[33:14] feasting on the word and you realize
[33:17] that you've come into this place and you
[33:18] know you you have a desire for the word
[33:20] and you keep going forward but you know
[33:22] what you can't stop there why because
[33:24] the devil wants you to get to that place
[33:26] where you get into a lull and you think
[33:27] you're okay and hey I'm I'm doing pretty
[33:29] good well you know what that's when you
[33:31] become religious and that's what he
[33:34] wants you to do he wants you to become
[33:35] religious but you've not come to the
[33:37] place where you've actually because
[33:39] you've been cleaned and set aside for
[33:41] service but you've not been put in
[33:43] service you've not come to the place
[33:45] where you've received the Holy Ghost and
[33:47] if you've got to come to the place
[33:48] you've got to keep pressing forward
[33:50] until you step into that place where the
[33:52] Holy Ghost takes up residence in you
[33:54] when you become when you realize there's
[33:56] a place when you realize the Holy Ghost
[33:58] is inside of you the Holy Ghost is
[34:00] living in you
[34:03] when you come to that place well you
[34:05] know what that don't solve all your
[34:06] problems
[34:08] because you know what as soon as you
[34:10] receive the Holy Ghost tell me one
[34:11] person when after you receive the Holy
[34:13] Ghost the Devil comes and tells you you
[34:15] didn't get it you didn't get it you
[34:17] didn't get it
[34:18] you think you did
[34:21] you're a make-believer
[34:24] what's he gonna do you ain't got it you
[34:26] ain't got it
[34:28] he gonna fight you all the way
[34:33] and that's his job
[34:36] you know we have a very good adversary
[34:40] but you know what you've got to press in
[34:41] you've got to keep fighting
[34:45] you know just because just because you
[34:47] said well I I'm mourning it well you
[34:48] know
[34:49] now the battle really far starts now you
[34:52] really gotta fight on your hands you got
[34:53] to keep you got to keep fighting
[34:57] you know everybody well you know I I've
[34:59] reached this
[35:00] I've reached this stage
[35:03] and we got a long way to go
[35:07] but you just got to keep fighting that
[35:09] that fight
[35:10] the devil all the way
[35:13] you don't let it you don't let him have
[35:15] a foothold in anything
[35:17] you just keep going
[35:21] but like like brother Brown said see
[35:23] when you come to this place
[35:28] he says we you know will we uh
[35:30] you know will I have to give up all
[35:32] these things no you don't have to give
[35:34] up these things
[35:37] don't try to give it up
[35:39] let the Holy Ghost do the work
[35:43] many times you know because people they
[35:45] have this issue and well I don't I don't
[35:47] know how I'm how I'm going to overcome
[35:51] because the devil just beats you down
[35:52] sometimes
[35:54] and I've seen young people go through
[35:56] that
[35:59] and you know you you get so ashamed of
[36:01] the things that you've done
[36:04] and you know what you you'll allow the
[36:06] devil to hold you back
[36:09] you'll stop your progress
[36:13] it'll stop your journey because you're
[36:15] so Bound by what the devil tells you to
[36:17] do
[36:19] well you know the thing is is exposing
[36:25] because that's that's the only thing the
[36:26] devil doesn't like to be exposed
[36:31] and you know what and and so many people
[36:34] you know they they fight so many spirits
[36:38] and and different things in their life
[36:39] and they they allow the devil to stop
[36:41] them right there
[36:43] well let me let me tell you something if
[36:46] you if you are especially if you go to
[36:49] this church if you call this your home
[36:51] church let me tell you something I want
[36:53] I want you to know it from from my voice
[36:55] and and the amens from the from this
[36:58] congregation let me tell you if you've
[37:00] got a problem I don't care what your
[37:01] problem is you know what we're always
[37:03] behind you we're always praying for you
[37:06] we're always going to be be there for
[37:08] you there's not anybody here that thinks
[37:10] somebody is better than somebody else
[37:13] there ain't no big eyes and little use
[37:15] in this church let me tell you something
[37:17] if you think you think well I'm all
[37:19] alone let me tell you you ain't all
[37:21] alone
[37:23] you know what you you might you might be
[37:25] alone but you ain't lonely
[37:29] but the devil will put that in your mind
[37:31] that you know I I'm I'm so I'm so this
[37:33] and I'm so that no listen if you're if
[37:36] you're on your journey let me tell you
[37:37] something you're a child of God you know
[37:39] what we claim we claim everybody you
[37:41] know what if you're pressing the battle
[37:43] you know what we're pressing the battle
[37:44] with you all you got all you got to do
[37:46] is say listen I got a problem bro George
[37:48] you I got a problem you know what all of
[37:50] us have got problems but you know what
[37:52] none of us quit
[37:55] now only the only time we allow Satan to
[37:58] have the victories when we quit
[38:01] when we start to listen to the devil
[38:03] what he what he tells us if we sit
[38:05] around and just contemplate all that you
[38:08] know I was telling sister June Sunday
[38:10] it's like you know we you know he is the
[38:12] he's the liar and he is a father of Lies
[38:14] but you know what we will sit and we
[38:16] will listen to what he tells us
[38:19] and the truth is not even any but you
[38:21] know what we will sit down and
[38:22] contemplate exactly what he tells us
[38:25] we waste our time listening to him
[38:31] when he begins to talk to you know what
[38:33] that he's he's a liar and the truth is
[38:36] not in him
[38:39] but you know what we'll say well you
[38:40] know and
[38:41] I might be right
[38:45] we ain't got time for that
[38:48] we ain't got time for none of that
[38:50] get rid of all that
[38:52] because you know what there there's no
[38:56] there's no virtue in any of that
[38:59] there's no strength in any of that
[39:02] you got nothing to nope
[39:05] getting a time for that contemplate that
[39:08] cast down all of Satan's reasonings
[39:13] all things that he says
[39:16] and just look to the word
[39:19] this is from the message the faith of
[39:21] Abraham brother branham's
[39:24] speaking
[39:25] he says so when when he stepped out on
[39:27] God's promise he said watch what
[39:29] happened God said Abraham he said oh my
[39:32] god listen to this Abraham just look as
[39:36] far west as you can look just as far
[39:39] east north and south it's all yours it's
[39:41] all yours blessed are the meek Jesus
[39:43] said for they shall inherit the earth
[39:45] Abraham's seed oh my
[39:47] he said then Abraham he said don't just
[39:49] stand and look at it
[39:52] walk through it it's yours
[39:56] he said it's yours that that's why I
[40:00] can't understand Christians
[40:02] except Christ when I accepted Christ I
[40:05] began to dig into the Bible see what I
[40:08] had and look through it
[40:15] he said he said if somebody give me a
[40:17] house I'd examine every inch of it I'd
[40:20] go through the pantry down in the cellar
[40:22] up in the attic he said I'd find out
[40:24] what I had when I become a Christian I
[40:26] want to know what I got what I'm an heir
[40:29] to what was give to me
[40:32] now listen he said some of you just step
[40:34] in the door say uh-huh it's awful nice
[40:37] somebody lived back there and I bet
[40:39] that'd be a pretty place there it's
[40:43] yours every promise is yours I want to
[40:46] know what I got
[40:48] he said it's a big arcade if somebody
[40:50] would give me a big arcade I'd start
[40:52] messing around looked on every shelf see
[40:55] what I got
[40:58] he said look it over pick this up go all
[41:01] over the all over the way through it go
[41:03] all the way through it it's mine I was
[41:05] baptized in it so I guess it belongs to
[41:07] me he said I was baptized by the Holy
[41:10] Ghost same one that was upon Abraham
[41:12] baptized me into the body he said I'm
[41:15] heir of every one of the promises if
[41:18] somebody looks like looks just a little
[41:21] bit High
[41:22] if something looks just a little bit
[41:24] High I'd go get me a step ladder and get
[41:27] on it and examine it see what it looks
[41:31] like that's the way if Divine Healing
[41:34] seems to be a little out of my reach I'd
[41:36] get on my knees that's Jacob's Ladder
[41:39] and climb right up up in prayer till I
[41:43] could find out what it's all about see
[41:45] what I own it's mine it's yours it's all
[41:48] of you's if you believe it
[41:51] so if if we are
[41:54] children of God and we've received this
[41:56] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then
[41:58] that's what he says then us we we see
[42:01] this as ours then we've received it just
[42:04] like Abraham
[42:05] Abraham by Grace Abraham received a
[42:09] promise he was given the promise but you
[42:11] know what he had to believe it
[42:13] and you know what he began to do he
[42:15] began to walk in his promise
[42:17] when he was a stranger
[42:20] when it wasn't his but God had promised
[42:22] it to him and he began to walk and he
[42:25] began to look everywhere well God told
[42:27] him look all around Mo Abraham look
[42:29] everywhere you look everywhere you see
[42:31] is yours all this belongs to you
[42:36] and he began to walk throughout all that
[42:39] you know what nobody else saw that
[42:42] but you know Abraham knew who he was
[42:45] and he began to walk all throughout that
[42:47] land and he said see if you are a child
[42:50] of God then you walk into that
[42:53] because all of that is yours and if it's
[42:56] been given to you because if you've come
[42:58] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost all
[43:00] of this belongs to you
[43:03] well then let me tell you something you
[43:04] know what if if God is is is if he
[43:08] justified you
[43:10] then you know what the promise in the
[43:12] scripture is that sanctification is
[43:14] yours
[43:17] you know what you don't have to plead
[43:19] and beg to come to that
[43:22] right why because God wants you to walk
[43:23] in faith God wants you to trust in him
[43:26] and believe you know what because that's
[43:27] what the scripture says
[43:30] because people how many times have
[43:32] people come to the place and you know
[43:33] they're seeking the baptism of the Holy
[43:36] Ghost and you see and you stop and ask
[43:37] them well what's the first thing you've
[43:39] got to do what does the scripture say
[43:41] repent
[43:43] have you do you know what do you know
[43:46] what true repentance is have you come to
[43:48] the place where you've repented
[43:51] and it's so people people want the
[43:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost and they don't
[43:55] even know what repentance is because
[43:56] when you begin to speak about repentance
[43:58] people people are lost
[44:01] you know it's like you're speaking
[44:02] another language
[44:06] and see but he said if you repent and be
[44:09] baptized
[44:10] he said then he said then you shall
[44:12] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[44:15] but all of this is a promise
[44:18] and so you just continue to walk in that
[44:20] well you know what you come to this if
[44:22] you come through that then you know what
[44:24] if he if you receive this then you know
[44:26] the promise is unto you
[44:29] then when you come in there all of this
[44:31] is all all this all the promises and all
[44:34] the scriptures are mine every promise in
[44:36] the book is mine
[44:40] well then the question is are you
[44:43] actually going to claim it are you going
[44:45] to let the devil squat on your land
[44:50] he said you was baptized by the grace of
[44:52] God into this great big arcade that's

[46:14] agent the Holy Ghost he will throw him
[46:17] out yes sir it's your property ever
[46:19] Divine promise in the Bible belongs to
[46:22] every Christian
[46:25] you know when you
[46:28] you know when you go to court
[46:30] and you know I was uh I spoke on that
[46:32] before you know when you go to court you
[46:33] know you don't have to go in there
[46:35] and plead before the judge
[46:39] you know when you go when you go to
[46:40] court and you and you have a case
[46:43] and you you have your attorney that goes
[46:46] in you know he's not up there screaming
[46:48] and crying and telling a sob story
[46:52] he says listen this person has legal
[46:55] standing in this court because as a as a
[46:57] resident of the state of Georgia and
[46:59] they live in a certain County or
[47:00] whatever and this is the law then what
[47:02] does he do he goes in there and tells
[47:04] them listen this is this person's legal
[47:06] standing because they have this abstract
[47:08] title deed they have this they have the
[47:11] legal right to this this is their
[47:13] standing and the law says so he goes
[47:16] back to the law and says the law says
[47:18] because they are a child of God and they
[47:20] have promised to this then he doesn't
[47:23] have legal standing here
[47:26] when you go to court when you when you
[47:28] were go to k to court to bring you plead
[47:31] your case then all you're doing is Hey
[47:32] listen I have a right to be here and
[47:34] this is the facts of the case and this
[47:36] is what the law says and then the judge
[47:38] is to to hear both sides of the argument
[47:41] but you know when you go in there and
[47:42] you show him what you've got then you
[47:43] know what he's supposed to answer the
[47:46] his verdict is supposed to because he's
[47:48] supposed to answer the question and his
[47:50] verdict is supposed to come forth and
[47:51] say like yes you have the legal right to
[47:53] this it belongs to you and he's got to
[47:56] go
[47:58] and it's the same way you don't have to
[48:00] plead and beg and and scream why because
[48:03] God wants to give you what what is yours
[48:06] what he's promised to you but you know
[48:08] the problem is is he wants us to believe
[48:10] him he wants us to have faith in him and
[48:13] trust him that it's going to take place
[48:17] many times you know people have
[48:20] you know because the devil wants us to
[48:22] get to a place where we just so worried
[48:24] and and fret and and get upset about
[48:27] things
[48:30] but you know that's that's not that's
[48:31] not
[48:32] the life of a Christian
[48:37] you know you just you just hold on and
[48:39] believe
[48:43] as you know in the scripture we know you
[48:45] you think about
[48:48] the the
[48:49] ones from the Old Testament different
[48:52] ones and you know you think about what
[48:54] they what they done Daniel there praying
[48:58] when that when they when the decree came
[49:00] the law came and said listen if you if
[49:03] you don't do what we tell you to do if
[49:05] you're not going to bow down to worship
[49:06] our image so we've been if you're not
[49:08] going to do these things and guess what
[49:09] we're going we've got a place for you
[49:11] we're gonna get rid of you
[49:13] there's a death sentence that hangs over
[49:15] your head
[49:17] but you know what you didn't see well
[49:19] Daniel up there Lord what am I going to
[49:22] do now
[49:24] yeah you know what he had he had faith
[49:26] in God
[49:28] he had a testimony that you know what it
[49:30] didn't matter what was going to take
[49:31] place he was going to trust God well he
[49:34] walked out there that he was going to
[49:35] trust God because hey y'all y'all get
[49:38] y'all want to kill me that's fine y'all
[49:40] exact your judgment
[49:43] they go ahead but you know I've Got
[49:45] Confidence in God I'm going to trust God
[49:47] I'm going to stand up here and I'm going
[49:49] to go forth and they throw up in the
[49:51] windows and pray and show everybody you
[49:53] know what I'm not afraid
[49:55] I've got my calls I serve a living God I
[49:58] serve the Living God I serve the high
[50:02] the all-powerful god
[50:04] and you know what if I die I die but you
[50:07] know what I'm going to steal I'm still
[50:08] going to trust God I'm still going to
[50:10] stand up and I'm still going to Proclaim
[50:12] that who God is and who I am
[50:17] he stood up there I'm going to trust God
[50:23] when they when they went out there to
[50:25] throw him in the Lion's Den you know he
[50:26] didn't he didn't worry about it
[50:29] but you know what because he put his
[50:32] confidence in God and he stood up for
[50:34] God you know what God come on the scene
[50:35] for him
[50:40] so many times when when the Devil Comes
[50:43] against us and he wants to try to he
[50:45] wants to lots of times like brother
[50:47] Brown said God puts things in your life
[50:49] things happen to see what you're going
[50:51] to do
[50:55] how are you going to handle it how are
[50:56] you going to respond to it
[51:00] so you can just get up there and
[51:03] see if you if you get to a place where
[51:04] you just well I don't know you're going
[51:06] to cower down
[51:07] say God can't trust people like that
[51:11] he wants to find out if you're going to
[51:13] if you're gonna if you're gonna go forth
[51:18] you know so many times we think about
[51:20] the the things that we we the scripture
[51:23] tells us about the different ones that
[51:24] are in the scripture you know you think
[51:26] about Daniel going into a lion's den and
[51:28] and different ones and you know how many
[51:30] how many people we would be standing and
[51:33] you know you're on a boat in the middle
[51:35] of a storm
[51:38] and I mean the the waves are crashing
[51:40] all around you know you can't see
[51:42] anything maybe maybe they felt like they
[51:44] were going to drown in all of the midst
[51:46] of all of that and here here's an all
[51:48] and all this storm here comes Jesus
[51:50] walking on the water
[51:53] and here that here they are coming
[51:55] walking you know they they the boat is
[51:57] about to sink
[51:59] they got no hopes
[52:01] they're going down
[52:05] because that was that was the devil's
[52:07] job he was going to sink that boat
[52:08] that's what he was after
[52:10] but Jesus come walking on the water
[52:14] and the rest of them were you know here
[52:16] they are they're already afraid because
[52:18] they think they're going to sink they
[52:20] think the boat's going to sink then they
[52:22] see a ghost and they start freaking out
[52:24] even more
[52:25] here they are but you know what Peter
[52:27] gets this idea he said Lord if that be
[52:29] you bid me to come
[52:32] well I can tell you right now that
[52:34] wouldn't be me
[52:39] you know because here you know I might
[52:41] be sinking in this boat but at least I
[52:42] got something underneath me
[52:48] I mean how many people you know I'm just
[52:49] gonna hop I'm just gonna hop out of this
[52:51] boat
[52:53] in a raging Storm
[52:57] but you know what there was something
[52:59] about Peter
[53:01] that when he saw Jesus
[53:04] he knew who Jesus was and he's like he
[53:06] said because he began to speak to him
[53:10] not to be not afraid it's I am it's me
[53:14] I'm here
[53:16] in the midst of this raging Storm
[53:20] and you know what and he and Peter had
[53:22] confidence in Jesus when he saw that he
[53:24] said Lord if that be you then bid me to
[53:26] come
[53:29] and he stepped hey guys said it would
[53:30] come and he climbed out of a out of a
[53:32] boat out into the raging Storm
[53:37] right man
[53:38] he wasn't he wasn't walking out on on
[53:41] the nice smooth Lake
[53:46] he's getting out in the water
[53:50] but you know what if he had confidence
[53:51] and Jesus being able to do that
[53:54] then you know what I can do the same
[53:56] thing
[53:57] because he spoke to me and said come
[54:00] he had confidence in that he could do
[54:02] the exact same thing he stepped out on
[54:03] that boat
[54:05] and you know what he had one way of
[54:07] doing it he had to keep his eyes on
[54:09] Jesus and if he could keep his eyes on
[54:11] Jesus he was able to walk he was able to
[54:14] do the impossible but he kept his eyes
[54:17] on Christ the whole time
[54:19] but you know what he got to the point
[54:21] where he got his eyes off oh then you
[54:22] know he got he got into he got a little
[54:25] maybe a little bit of lighted you know
[54:26] he's out there like look what I'm doing
[54:27] look what I'm doing
[54:32] then all of a sudden instead of keeping
[54:34] his eyes on Jesus he got into his mind
[54:37] and started thinking
[54:38] what am I standing on
[54:41] then he starts looking at the waves
[54:45] it's like I don't know if I should be
[54:47] here
[54:49] and then he starts sinking
[54:54] and instead of staying and thinking you
[54:56] know what Jesus is doing it and Jesus
[54:59] told me to come
[55:00] and if I can just keep my eyes on him
[55:02] and keep following the words you know I
[55:03] keep doing that yeah
[55:06] yeah and then all of a sudden when he
[55:07] got to the point where he got looking
[55:08] all around and he got afraid he started
[55:10] sinking and Jesus come and pulled him
[55:12] out of the water and said Peter why'd
[55:14] you doubt
[55:16] look you were overcoming
[55:19] and took him right back to the ship and
[55:20] got in and then he spoke to the storm
[55:22] and calmed the waters
[55:25] and the still and the storm went away
[55:28] see if if we have the same if we have
[55:32] that same faith that we can we can do
[55:34] the impossible
[55:36] he is the god of the impossible
[55:39] if you can if you can trust him that he
[55:42] is because he's the same one that called
[55:45] Peter when he was down on the on the Sea
[55:47] on the shore of Galilee and he called
[55:50] Peter to follow him
[55:55] and brought him all that way
[56:00] and so all of the all the faults and
[56:02] failures that Peter had all the problems
[56:04] that Peter had you know what God still
[56:05] kept dealing with him
[56:07] Jesus kept speaking to him
[56:11] you know he told me he said look all you
[56:14] know he knew what Peter was going to do
[56:15] he knew Peter was going to fall and have
[56:17] problems
[56:22] well you had said when he had such love
[56:24] for for the Lord that he was standing
[56:27] out there and and Jesus is telling him
[56:29] listen Peter
[56:31] just gonna be me
[56:33] I'm going through all this
[56:35] I've got to die
[56:37] and I'm Gonna Be Alone
[56:39] and nobody's going to be with me
[56:42] I got to bear this I got to Bear all
[56:43] this by myself
[56:46] alone Lord Lord let me tell you what I'm
[56:48] gonna be right there with you the whole
[56:49] time
[56:49] I'm on your sixth the whole time
[56:52] I got you
[56:55] no Peter let me tell you
[56:59] can you imagine when he stood there and
[57:00] said he said Lord
[57:02] you know everybody else I forsake you
[57:04] but I'm gonna be right there with him
[57:06] Peter you're going to deny me three
[57:07] times
[57:10] listen you're gonna deny me
[57:11] but you know what Jesus when he when he
[57:14] when he went through all all of that and
[57:16] he died and he rose again and he come
[57:18] back and he told Mary and them he said
[57:20] go tell my disciples and Peter
[57:24] go tell Peter that I've risen
[57:27] and to meet me in Jerusalem come meet me
[57:30] I'm coming to see you
[57:34] why because he wanted Peter no listen I
[57:37] know who you are and I know your faults
[57:39] and failures but you know I want you to
[57:40] know I still love you
[57:42] I still think about you why because I
[57:44] died for you
[57:47] yeah you know the one the one that he
[57:49] had had all of the issues with Peter had
[57:52] had to talk to Peter all the time
[57:55] he's up he's in the upper room you know
[57:58] as a scripture was reading the Sunday
[58:00] you know here he's in the upper room and
[58:01] he's and he's speaking to the disciples
[58:03] and he and he's going to wash their feet
[58:05] and Peter's like you ain't washing mine
[58:08] you know the rest of them he can wash
[58:10] their feet but he's the one that he's
[58:11] got to be contentious
[58:17] but listen Peter I'm doing something
[58:18] that you'll understand later you may not
[58:20] understand this right now
[58:24] because listen I'm just washing your
[58:25] feet because this is an example that I'm
[58:27] doing
[58:29] right but listen one of these days
[58:31] you're going to understand because well
[58:32] Lord wash my hands and my feet washed me
[58:34] all over Lord that's that time comes
[58:39] but I'm doing something right now that
[58:41] you'll understand later
[58:44] but but listen you're because there's
[58:46] coming a time you will be clean
[58:49] why because the Holy Ghost is coming
[58:51] you're going to go through that process
[58:53] but I'm showing you something
[58:56] listen now because here I am your master
[58:59] and Lord and I'm showing you how to be a
[59:02] servant
[59:04] but because that's that's your goal to
[59:06] be a servant
[59:08] and so when when see when later on then
[59:10] Peter could come back and look look at
[59:12] the life that Jesus lived and know I am
[59:15] a servant
[59:17] because of the things that I've seen God
[59:20] has brought me this place but I want you
[59:22] to understand what I've been through I
[59:23] want you to understand the grace of God
[59:27] because if Peter went out there and
[59:28] began to talk to the people he said
[59:30] listen he said when you come through all
[59:31] this Peter strengthen the brethren
[59:34] why because when everybody else is out
[59:35] of well brother Peter you know what I'm
[59:38] struggling I went through this and I
[59:39] went through that
[59:41] I got a story for you
[59:44] listen y'all want to know what Grace is
[59:47] I denied the Lord
[59:49] this is Grace
[59:51] you want to know what Grace is
[59:53] I'm all the time trying to contend with
[59:55] the Lord but you know what this is Grace
[59:58] when you want to know what Grace is just
[1:00:00] like when he calls Paul and he comes and
[1:00:03] brings Paul and Paul becomes out there
[1:00:05] and he talks about being the prisoner of
[1:00:06] the Lord and he begins to talk about
[1:00:08] being the grace of God and he begins to
[1:00:10] talk about the grace why because he's
[1:00:12] standing there talking about I've
[1:00:13] received look what I was I was a
[1:00:16] blasphemer
[1:00:18] I I was the one that that instructed
[1:00:21] people to put the Christians to death
[1:00:24] I stood there and held their coach while
[1:00:26] they were stolen Stephen
[1:00:29] and you know here this is the grace of
[1:00:31] God that he called me to preach the
[1:00:33] unsearchable riches unto the Gentiles
[1:00:37] when I was the one that was standing
[1:00:38] there watching Christians die
[1:00:43] and say but this is the grace of God
[1:00:45] Amen
[1:00:47] when you think when you think you've
[1:00:49] you're lost and you're alienated and all
[1:00:51] that I'm going to tell you what the
[1:00:52] grace of God is
[1:00:54] and say when we look at the when our
[1:00:57] lives and we say well I I've fallen but
[1:00:59] you know what there's Grace that that
[1:01:01] abounds more than you can comprehend
[1:01:04] and that's why God wants you to see
[1:01:05] there's Grace
[1:01:08] if you can see the grace of God and all
[1:01:10] the things that have taken place God
[1:01:12] knew everything that you would do all
[1:01:14] your faults all your failures all your
[1:01:16] problems God knew all of that there's
[1:01:19] nothing that's going to that that God uh
[1:01:22] was surprised about
[1:01:27] you know you know uh
[1:01:30] brother Bob always talks about me being
[1:01:33] in like genealogy so uh but you know
[1:01:36] when you think about your genealogy you
[1:01:39] know brother Graham said you know for
[1:01:41] you to get here
[1:01:43] he had to breathe you know this one come
[1:01:45] to this one and all this you know when
[1:01:47] when you think about it
[1:01:50] so if
[1:01:53] you just try to you start to think about
[1:01:56] some of this stuff sometimes
[1:01:58] if you count
[1:02:01] if you count your
[1:02:03] your parents as one generation back
[1:02:07] and then your grandparents be two
[1:02:09] generations back and your
[1:02:11] great-grandparents three
[1:02:13] if you go back 10 Generations which is
[1:02:15] your eighth great-grandparents
[1:02:18] do you know how many of your eighth
[1:02:20] great-grandparents you have
[1:02:23] if you went back 10 Generations you know
[1:02:26] how many you know how many
[1:02:27] eighth grade grandparents you have
[1:02:30] you have a thousand and 24.
[1:02:35] there was a thousand and 24 people
[1:02:39] that had to get together
[1:02:43] when you start to think about that
[1:02:47] for you to for you to be who you are
[1:02:49] today
[1:02:52] you think about when you when you go
[1:02:53] back to you go back 12 Generations I say
[1:02:55] there's I think they say there's 4096
[1:02:58] ancestors and that in that generation
[1:03:02] over four thousand
[1:03:06] those four thousand over four thousand
[1:03:08] people had to come together
[1:03:13] and in the mind of God he knew every one
[1:03:15] of them was going to come
[1:03:17] because every one of them had to you
[1:03:19] know and you think about all of the all
[1:03:21] of the
[1:03:23] I think about my grandfather
[1:03:26] my paternal grandfather
[1:03:29] served in World War II under Patton
[1:03:32] he had one time he was he had landed on
[1:03:34] the beach
[1:03:36] they come through Sicily into France
[1:03:40] he hit the beach I was like 54 of them
[1:03:42] there's only two survived him and
[1:03:44] another man
[1:03:46] he was in the combat engineers he built
[1:03:49] Bridges the Germans bombed it twice they
[1:03:52] were rebuilding it the third time they
[1:03:54] were carrying a big steel plate that
[1:03:56] took six men to carry
[1:03:59] they got hit
[1:04:01] all five of the other men that he was
[1:04:03] carrying that plate with died
[1:04:05] he was the only one that survived
[1:04:09] he stood there and told us as kids
[1:04:14] he said you don't know what the
[1:04:15] Supernatural is he said big I can be a
[1:04:18] little kid I can still remember being a
[1:04:19] little kid sitting there and him talking
[1:04:21] about he said the angel of the Lord had
[1:04:23] to be standing in front of me he said
[1:04:25] because I could hear the bullets go in
[1:04:26] that direction in that direction
[1:04:29] but they didn't hit me
[1:04:34] when you see those type things why
[1:04:37] because you know what we had to come
[1:04:38] into existence
[1:04:41] and you think about all you know you
[1:04:43] think about all of your ancestors that
[1:04:45] traveled
[1:04:46] on boats
[1:04:49] for months
[1:04:51] all across the oceans
[1:04:55] and you think about all the ones that
[1:04:56] come from all around the world
[1:05:00] and all the things that they had to go
[1:05:02] through
[1:05:04] all of all the suffering the heartaches
[1:05:06] all of the problems and you know what
[1:05:08] all of that had to take place all the
[1:05:09] way down for you to be who you are
[1:05:14] and you're like well you know what I'm
[1:05:16] just I'm just a little insignificant
[1:05:18] blip on the screen and you know God
[1:05:20] don't know where I'm at you know what
[1:05:22] God God knew all that
[1:05:25] and he got you all the way down through
[1:05:27] here because you were one of his you
[1:05:29] come all this way to be manifested in
[1:05:32] this hour
[1:05:34] and you cut you've come to all of that
[1:05:38] all the things you you think of how all
[1:05:40] that come about
[1:05:44] for God to realize to manifest what he
[1:05:48] wanted to in this hour
[1:05:49] for you to come into existence
[1:05:52] because you are what God had in his mind
[1:05:56] and through and through the fall
[1:06:00] you know all of those all those
[1:06:02] attributes had to be displayed had to be
[1:06:05] expressed and you know what all that had
[1:06:06] to take place
[1:06:10] you know God you know sometimes we think
[1:06:12] well it's just you know
[1:06:15] like the world wants to think you know
[1:06:16] it's just like rolling the dice
[1:06:20] you know it's just just some haphazard
[1:06:22] something happened
[1:06:24] no when you start to see what God's done
[1:06:27] all this way
[1:06:31] when God what God has done all this way
[1:06:34] to bring you to this place
[1:06:38] and he's brought you to the place where
[1:06:40] he's made himself known unto you
[1:06:43] he brought you because there was a day
[1:06:46] that the word passed you away
[1:06:49] and he made itself known to you
[1:06:53] and he filled you with the Holy Ghost
[1:06:57] and he's brought you into this and he
[1:06:59] wants you to
[1:07:01] Feast on this
[1:07:04] then
[1:07:05] you know what it's a sad thing if we
[1:07:08] don't walk as the scripture says if we
[1:07:11] don't walk in newness of spirit if we
[1:07:13] don't walk in the newness of life if we
[1:07:15] don't walk a new way
[1:07:18] to walk and realize hey all this is
[1:07:20] God's done all this for me
[1:07:25] and then when we we don't realize who
[1:07:27] where God's brought us from and all the
[1:07:29] things that's taking place and then we
[1:07:30] don't have we don't have faith to heal
[1:07:32] the toothache
[1:07:36] and not realize what God's done for us
[1:07:38] that God has brought us all this way
[1:07:44] if he's If he if he does if he done all
[1:07:46] that he could do he done the very best
[1:07:49] and give give his life
[1:07:53] if he's done that then then you know
[1:07:55] what then we can accept and reap the
[1:07:58] benefits of that
[1:08:04] so this is this is from uh trying to do
[1:08:06] God a service
[1:08:08] and brother Bram says but one great
[1:08:10] thing again about God he has not left us
[1:08:14] not without knowing what's the truth and
[1:08:16] how to do it
[1:08:18] he wouldn't be just to punish us for
[1:08:20] doing something that we didn't know
[1:08:22] how it was going to be done
[1:08:25] didn't let us stumble into something he
[1:08:27] is not that kind of God he's a God that
[1:08:30] speaks the word and expects his children
[1:08:31] to believe it and therefore he knows
[1:08:34] what's best and when when to do it and
[1:08:37] how to do it he said we have our ideas
[1:08:39] of it but he knows
[1:08:43] so when when things come our way see God
[1:08:46] knows what to take place and how how
[1:08:48] it's going to take place all things are
[1:08:49] going to happen
[1:08:53] he's like well I don't know why well you
[1:08:55] know that's what the word is for
[1:08:58] the word has come to bring us to the
[1:09:00] place we know how to do it we know
[1:09:02] exactly where we are and Who We Are
[1:09:05] and so
[1:09:06] going back to the previous one when when
[1:09:08] he was talking about when you are
[1:09:12] a child of God and brothers talking
[1:09:14] about Satan being a squatter
[1:09:17] when he's squatting on your land he said
[1:09:20] you can go to court
[1:09:22] you go to court and you through the Holy
[1:09:25] Ghost he said is it God's law
[1:09:27] enforcement agent he will force him off
[1:09:30] the land he will force him out
[1:09:33] I said brother Brown says and the great
[1:09:35] thing about this is he doesn't leave us
[1:09:38] a place where we don't know how to do
[1:09:40] that
[1:09:41] because we've been given the legal right
[1:09:43] to force him out and guess what he's
[1:09:46] also given us the way to show us how to
[1:09:48] do that
[1:09:50] how you overcome
[1:09:53] well because he he's he's the same one
[1:09:56] he shows you how how to come through
[1:09:58] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:10:01] of the Holy Ghost and then when you get
[1:10:03] it born into the body then he shows you
[1:10:06] how to continue on
[1:10:09] then when you go up the stage of a
[1:10:10] perfect man what is him showing you how
[1:10:12] to do that
[1:10:13] when you need healing he shows you that
[1:10:16] how you go overcoming
[1:10:18] why because he's giving you the word to
[1:10:20] show you how to do that
[1:10:23] so all these things see he shows you how
[1:10:25] to do that
[1:10:27] says then if he set up a system
[1:10:30] that what he's going to do and didn't
[1:10:33] tell us what was going to happen and how
[1:10:35] it was going to happen then we stumbling
[1:10:37] at it would be justified in our
[1:10:39] stumblings and trying to do something
[1:10:41] each one but would be justified but
[1:10:44] there's one there's only one way and
[1:10:46] that is his word
[1:10:48] so he's given us the word to show us the
[1:10:51] things that we have to do and how to do
[1:10:53] it because the word will instruct you
[1:10:55] how to do the things because why because
[1:10:58] the the Holy Spirit if it's on the
[1:11:00] inside of you you desire the word
[1:11:03] then if you desire the word then you
[1:11:05] know what it's going to draw you to the
[1:11:07] word
[1:11:09] all the way through your journey he's
[1:11:11] drawing you to the word and the thing is
[1:11:13] is when you you say well Lord I don't
[1:11:14] know how to do this I got a question
[1:11:15] about this or whatever then then what is
[1:11:17] he doing he's going to draw you into the
[1:11:20] word and you're going to begin to feed
[1:11:22] on word and he'll begin to deal with you
[1:11:24] in the areas that that pertain to your
[1:11:26] life
[1:11:29] how many times have you said in the
[1:11:31] truck or the car and you go down the
[1:11:32] road you're sitting at home you think
[1:11:34] about something and you've got a
[1:11:35] question about something and all of a
[1:11:37] sudden somebody comes to church and
[1:11:39] brother Wade gets behind the pulpit and
[1:11:41] he begins to talk about something and
[1:11:43] maybe sometimes he gets off his notes
[1:11:45] and all of a sudden he's off somewhere
[1:11:46] else talking about something but all of
[1:11:48] a sudden everybody's like well why is he
[1:11:49] over there well you know what he's
[1:11:51] dealing with somebody they may be
[1:11:53] somebody listening in and all of a
[1:11:54] sudden the Lord's leading him a certain
[1:11:55] way that he begins to deal with a
[1:11:57] certain thing and all of a sudden
[1:11:59] somebody's getting their answer
[1:12:02] how many times have you come to church
[1:12:04] and all of a sudden nobody knows what's
[1:12:06] going on nobody knows what you think but
[1:12:08] all of a sudden when the when the
[1:12:10] preacher begins to speak or some brother
[1:12:12] comes up here and starts doing Sunday
[1:12:13] school or whatever all of a sudden the
[1:12:15] things that they say is right down your
[1:12:17] alley right down your line everything's
[1:12:19] like hey that's exactly for me
[1:12:22] why because God knows what you have need
[1:12:24] of and when we begin to meditate on then
[1:12:26] the Lord begins to deal with the things
[1:12:28] that we're looking for
[1:12:31] it's in the word
[1:12:34] and he begins to feed us on the word the
[1:12:36] things that we have negative
[1:12:43] so brother I'm speaking of
[1:12:46] you know growing
[1:12:49] he's talking about growing trees and you
[1:12:51] know when you plant the seed in the
[1:12:52] ground
[1:12:55] see when that when when you plant the
[1:12:57] seed talk about the word of God when the
[1:12:59] when the seed goes in the ground you
[1:13:00] just it goes in the in the ground you
[1:13:03] got to plant it and you got to water it
[1:13:08] you see when those things take place and
[1:13:10] he says see go to the the next one
[1:13:13] Brothers but he said say he said well it
[1:13:16] has to drink more than its portion
[1:13:18] it has to drink and drink so much till
[1:13:21] it pushes it out
[1:13:23] until it pushes out so you've got to you
[1:13:26] gotta take in all that you can for your
[1:13:29] situation
[1:13:31] he said it begins to push out limbs see
[1:13:34] when that seed is planted when the word
[1:13:36] of God is planted inside of you then you
[1:13:37] keep watering it you keep feeding it
[1:13:40] because then all of a sudden it's going
[1:13:42] to come forth
[1:13:45] just like brother Wade was talking about
[1:13:46] you know if you if you put a seed in the
[1:13:49] ground then you know what you need to
[1:13:50] have the right nutrients in the ground
[1:13:52] because you you can put a seed in the
[1:13:54] ground in poor soil but if you don't put
[1:13:56] any nutrients in there you can water it
[1:13:58] from now to and and it's not ever going
[1:14:00] to come it's not ever going to come up
[1:14:02] and it's not ever going to come to the
[1:14:04] fruition that it needs it never comes to
[1:14:06] its full potential why because the
[1:14:08] nutrients aren't there
[1:14:11] but see what's the reason when it comes
[1:14:13] our responsibility to prepare the ground
[1:14:15] so when the word of God Goes Forth then
[1:14:17] we can receive it that it can grow
[1:14:23] he said it pushed out limbs it pushes
[1:14:27] out leaves it pushes out apples
[1:14:29] he said it's in it but it has to keep
[1:14:32] drinking and he said in every word of
[1:14:34] God as a seed and that seed can be
[1:14:36] planted by the inexhaustible Fountain of
[1:14:39] Life which is Christ the believer has to
[1:14:41] drink Beyond his imagination drink and
[1:14:44] push out push out everything you have
[1:14:47] need of because it's in you when you
[1:14:49] receive Christ and we are planted
[1:14:51] together in Christ and he is the
[1:14:54] inexhaustible Fountain of Life
[1:14:57] and he said don't never
[1:14:59] be afraid to ask big things
[1:15:02] God wants you to ask big things he don't
[1:15:05] want you to be little petty and juvenile
[1:15:08] he wants you to ask big things that your
[1:15:11] Joys may be full and then he begins to
[1:15:14] tell the story about the fish being in
[1:15:15] the water you know in the Atlantic Ocean
[1:15:17] and worried about how much water he
[1:15:20] drinks and wonder if he's going to have
[1:15:21] enough he's going to survive because you
[1:15:23] know and talks about the uh the mouse
[1:15:26] and
[1:15:27] Egypt and the and the gardeners and
[1:15:30] wondering if we're going to have enough
[1:15:33] well we might just eat two of these we
[1:15:35] got to save up we don't know what's
[1:15:36] going to happen next
[1:15:41] and he said and he begins to talk about
[1:15:43] how how the inexhaustible the ocean was
[1:15:46] and brother I'm talking about the rat
[1:15:48] and the gardener he said if there had
[1:15:49] been ten hundred thousand rats that size
[1:15:52] they'd never be able to eat it up
[1:15:55] and how many times could we multiply you
[1:15:58] could never exhaust God in his powers
[1:16:00] and his mercies to his children he's the
[1:16:03] inexhaustible Fountain of Life just
[1:16:05] drink and drink and drink and drink
[1:16:14] this is from the from the message
[1:16:16] what does thou here
[1:16:17] and he's talking about he's talking
[1:16:19] about Elijah in the still Small Voice he
[1:16:21] said let's get that still Small Voice
[1:16:23] that somebody that something that puts
[1:16:26] the cream in the life that something
[1:16:28] that though you speak with tongues of
[1:16:31] men and angels and have not that you're
[1:16:32] nothing though you can prophesy and
[1:16:35] speak with tongues and show signs and
[1:16:37] wonders and work miracles and do great
[1:16:39] signs but if you if that still that
[1:16:42] little still small voice isn't there
[1:16:43] you're nothing says the scripture that's
[1:16:45] what we're listening for now we've had
[1:16:48] the Thunders we've had the fire we've
[1:16:49] had the rushing winds and the
[1:16:50] earthquakes but God send us the still
[1:16:53] Small Voice that's what we need
[1:16:58] and he says you can never exhaust God's
[1:17:01] love and mercy to you say well I hate to
[1:17:03] bother you so much father he wants you
[1:17:06] to bother him that way he does don't
[1:17:10] ever think that you could ever ask too
[1:17:13] much of God I believe the scriptures he
[1:17:15] said you have not because you ask not
[1:17:17] yes not because you believe not he wants
[1:17:20] us to ask and believe that our joys
[1:17:23] Joyce would be full he wants you to ask
[1:17:26] abundantly ask for big things don't
[1:17:28] limit your faith to some little mustard
[1:17:31] seed
[1:17:34] he says he says get on
[1:17:36] get on out here to some other kind of
[1:17:40] faith and move out in big things he said
[1:17:43] big things is just as easier to receive
[1:17:45] as little things you just have to
[1:17:48] believe that's all and if you've got
[1:17:49] faith just know exactly
[1:17:52] how to use it and it'll be all right you
[1:17:54] can put it right to work
[1:17:56] and it'll be fine and he said could you
[1:17:59] imagine talking about exhausting God's
[1:18:01] love and Power
[1:18:02] and beneficiaries for you could you
[1:18:04] imagine the little bitty fish a long way
[1:18:07] talk about that little fish again been
[1:18:10] up there
[1:18:11] in the middle of the ocean he said I
[1:18:13] better consider this thing a better
[1:18:15] drink of this water sparingly because I
[1:18:17] might run out someday a little fish
[1:18:19] about that big in the middle of the
[1:18:21] ocean
[1:18:22] he said well that could easily be done
[1:18:25] more easier than you could ask too much
[1:18:27] of God he's the inexhaustible Fountain
[1:18:30] of Life whatever you have need of ask
[1:18:32] him and believe it he provided it in the
[1:18:35] Redemptive blessings when he died at
[1:18:38] Calvary and gave a promise to you for
[1:18:40] everything you have you have need of
[1:18:42] while you're in the journey
[1:18:47] it's yours and you'll uh if you'll ask
[1:18:49] can believe that's right
[1:18:52] and he begins to talk about that little
[1:18:55] mouse again
[1:18:56] said when he talks about being that that
[1:18:59] little mouse down there and he says see
[1:19:01] that's the way people act as Christians
[1:19:03] get up of a morning God bless my family
[1:19:05] today and keep us Close to You amen well
[1:19:08] I've done my religion for the day
[1:19:10] oh I just like to lay down really and
[1:19:14] drink don't you and just get a real
[1:19:16] spiritual gastronomical Jubilee and just
[1:19:19] drink till you just can't drink no more
[1:19:22] just continue to drink
[1:19:24] and this is from the message why do us
[1:19:27] thou here and I wanted to get to this he
[1:19:30] begins to talk about that still small
[1:19:31] voice again see if we get back to that
[1:19:33] still Small Voice that he spoke to us
[1:19:35] about and he that's the state because
[1:19:37] it's the same voice that started you on
[1:19:39] your Journeys the same voice that'll
[1:19:41] speak to you all the way through and
[1:19:43] it's the same voice and he because he's
[1:19:45] talking about you know if you see these
[1:19:46] things and understand God wants you to
[1:19:49] ask big things don't ask for just little
[1:19:50] things but the big things and he said
[1:19:52] see big think great things are quiet
[1:19:55] things
[1:19:57] all right did you know that friends
[1:19:59] listen the son now listen this the sun
[1:20:02] which gives life on the earth to every
[1:20:05] little living thing and body life plant
[1:20:07] life tree life and whatever it brings
[1:20:09] forth life
[1:20:10] the sun does
[1:20:14] and he says and it can draw a million
[1:20:17] gallons of water
[1:20:18] from the earth and make
[1:20:20] less noise than we can get a bucket full
[1:20:23] of out of a pump
[1:20:25] say it's big things Quiet Things are big
[1:20:28] things did you ever hear the world
[1:20:30] turning
[1:20:31] did you ever hear the parent the planets
[1:20:34] as they pass through the orbit
[1:20:36] did you ever hear one
[1:20:38] that's the big things
[1:20:40] did you ever hear the sun rise
[1:20:46] when we began to look at the big things
[1:20:50] see God wants us to ask for the big
[1:20:53] things
[1:20:55] if you have if you have a need
[1:20:58] I don't care how big it is God wants you
[1:21:00] to ask
[1:21:01] you know brother Brown said God has a
[1:21:04] you know God has a problem with you not
[1:21:06] asking when you're a child of his and
[1:21:08] you have a need and you don't ask him
[1:21:12] and you don't pour your heart out to God
[1:21:15] then God has a problem with that
[1:21:18] and when you can't say Lord I'm gonna
[1:21:20] put my trust in you no matter what I put
[1:21:23] my trust in I got my confidence in you
[1:21:26] amen and you know the thing is is
[1:21:30] when God's on the same God does Miracles
[1:21:32] and you know what you never see it
[1:21:37] you know because God wants you to ask
[1:21:42] you know I tell everybody all the time
[1:21:47] I had
[1:21:49] I had
[1:21:51] when I worked for heating and air
[1:21:52] company before a work what I do now
[1:21:55] you know we lost the keys to the truck
[1:21:57] everybody's heard that story about you
[1:21:59] know we lost the truck keys and man let
[1:22:00] me tell you what we went high and low
[1:22:01] and everywhere looking for him
[1:22:04] we had to have those keys for that truck
[1:22:06] we got one set of keys and they were
[1:22:08] gone
[1:22:09] we went through the dumpster and
[1:22:10] everything else we went looking
[1:22:11] everywhere
[1:22:14] because when I drove the van back to the
[1:22:17] shop I backed it in the parking place
[1:22:19] and I usually carried the keys into the
[1:22:21] shop and I laid them on the desk in
[1:22:23] there so if anybody needed them they
[1:22:24] could get in there
[1:22:26] man those keys were gone it's like we
[1:22:29] need those keys
[1:22:31] me and a buddy of mine we was digging
[1:22:33] through everything praying and looking
[1:22:34] and we couldn't find them
[1:22:36] and I went home
[1:22:40] and you know I was praying Lord I don't
[1:22:42] know where those keys are I don't know
[1:22:44] where they're at and I like we need
[1:22:47] those keys Lord
[1:22:49] and I prayed and prayed and I went to
[1:22:51] bed and I didn't sleep very good that
[1:22:53] night but I
[1:22:55] in the midst of that
[1:23:00] that night I had a dream and brother Ron
[1:23:02] Spencer come to me in a dream
[1:23:06] and I and I as soon as I saw brother Ron
[1:23:08] I told him to brother Ron
[1:23:09] I don't know where those keys are we
[1:23:11] need them
[1:23:12] and brother Ron said don't worry brother
[1:23:14] Aaron the Lord knows where they're at
[1:23:15] he'll take care of it you know brother
[1:23:17] Ron he's he he's he's never lost for you
[1:23:21] know he's always positive it don't
[1:23:23] matter what's going on I ain't never
[1:23:24] seen brother brother Ron down or
[1:23:26] whatever and you know he he come don't
[1:23:28] you worry
[1:23:30] the Lord will take care of he knows
[1:23:31] where those keys are
[1:23:34] but I went to work the next day and you
[1:23:36] know we had a little barbecue grill out
[1:23:38] beside the
[1:23:40] right out beside the door the shop door
[1:23:44] and we had the trash cans and had a
[1:23:46] barbecue grill like sometimes we cooked
[1:23:48] on and
[1:23:49] I was heading into the shop
[1:23:53] and my boss come by and he said we found
[1:23:55] the keys
[1:23:57] really
[1:23:58] yeah he said they were laying on top of
[1:24:00] that black barbecue grill when I got up
[1:24:02] this morning when I got here this
[1:24:03] morning
[1:24:05] I had a set of black cart you know I
[1:24:07] don't have my keys with me but anyway we
[1:24:09] had a
[1:24:10] a door opener
[1:24:12] the remote and had keys and it had an
[1:24:15] orange
[1:24:16] number one about that big on the
[1:24:18] keychain that was all that was on there
[1:24:21] sitting on top of a solid black barbecue
[1:24:24] grill
[1:24:25] and we walked in now that door multiple
[1:24:27] times
[1:24:29] and that orange number one was laying on
[1:24:30] top that's the first thing he saw that
[1:24:31] orange number one laying on top of that
[1:24:33] barbecue grill
[1:24:35] we walked high and low we worked
[1:24:37] everywhere
[1:24:39] but you know what the Lord told me not
[1:24:41] to worry
[1:24:45] I don't know how it got there
[1:24:48] it's not my job to know
[1:24:50] but I know the Lord put them there
[1:24:52] I don't know where they come from but
[1:24:54] you know what the next morning they were
[1:24:55] there
[1:25:00] when I got when I got laid off from that
[1:25:02] job I was sitting at home in front of
[1:25:05] the computer we was getting ready to go
[1:25:06] to the fellowship meeting at brother
[1:25:07] homers
[1:25:09] and I was sitting there and I'm thinking
[1:25:10] what am I going to do
[1:25:16] and I
[1:25:18] and while I was sitting there
[1:25:20] starting to have my little pity party
[1:25:23] the Lord come by and told me he said you
[1:25:25] know who's preaching the fellowship
[1:25:26] meeting today
[1:25:28] and it oh wow
[1:25:31] brother Ron Spencer is preaching
[1:25:35] and brother in Alabama at brother
[1:25:37] Homer's
[1:25:40] and so when I went down there I told
[1:25:41] brother I was telling brother Ron after
[1:25:43] church you know that you know it's like
