memory or something like that to that degree so the older you get you'll start start writing things down when we get where we can't find our way home without writing it down we stop driving okay but we do the best we can okay if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn today to where we've been reading in Romans 8 and then we will go to Isaiah 65 and Genesis 1 Romans 8 Isaiah 65 Genesis 1 Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this day and your grace unto us thank you for all things and you give them to us freely so we just pray that you would bless and guide each and every one of us and let your love be made manifest in our hearts in our lives this day that you may be the one to have the preeminence in each one of us we've gathered today for one purpose and that is to hear from you so come Among Us and speak to us in a great way we love you and we thank you bless all of these that are not here by traveling and different things and bless those that are sick and just reach down and

we want to stand complete in you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen I know maybe Joe and him's up this morning and we say hi to them and all pray the Lord would bless them and take care of them uh we miss Jonas I ain't saying we don't miss the rest of them but we miss Jonas I go out and and uh put water in all of for the Virginia and every day she says Jonas Jonas Jonas so we're trying to maybe get him back home right okay Romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen Isaiah 65 we'll begin reading at verse 17 and I know this goes into the Millennium and all but that's the purpose that you'll see in the minute of the scripture for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall be remembered shall not be remembered nor coming into mine but be you glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people of Joy I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying there shall be no more then an infin of days nor an old man that shall not fulfill his that hath not fulfilled his days for the child shall D in 100 years old but the sinner being 100 years old shall be a cursed and they shall build houses and inhabit them they shall plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build and another inhabit now that's a wonderful promise ain't nobody can't take away from you what's yours they shall not plant and another eat far as the days of a tree are the days of my people and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the Blessed of the Lord and their offspring with them now that's the point we're getting to for they are the seed of the Blessed of the Lord and their offspring with them now if if it's a seed and then you get your Offspring see if you read that correctly and understand you can claim your children right in Christ all right see because then you're Offspring with you because if you're the seed they're the seed right come on that that's these are the scriptures brother around them used when he was preaching the spoken word is the Original Seed okay and it shall come to F before they call I will answer and while they are speaking I will hear okay now one more because these are the scriptures brother randam used on the spoken word is the Original Seed and we're just reading part of it so we go to Genesis 1:9 and God said let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place and let the dry land appear and it was so and God called a dry land Earth and the Gathering Together the waters Waters called his seas and God saw that it was good and God said let the Earth bring forth Grace the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yeld yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself now once it's after its kind why because the seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good and the morning and the evening was the third day you may be seated The Lord At His blessing to the reading of the word now as I said we will get down into it talking about it but these are the scriptures the Isaiah and Genesis that brother RAM used when he was preaching the spoken word is the Original Seed all right now we we tried this past last weekend because we didn't have any servic our Wednesday but we were trying to get a point to us and to understand something because to me now one of these days you'll see why that I have put so many services into a lineup to uh be able to understand what the prophet was talking about CU we believe what he said he said you come here with a seed in you I believe that but I don't believe that like a lot of people believe it you know I I believe that there is an eternal judgment I believe there is an eternal condemnation and that's what people believes and see they go on and believe there's an eternal hell I don't believe that do you understand what I'm saying I don't believe that I believe in Eternal judgment because once you're judged it's done I believe in Eternal condemnation if you're condemned it's done ain't nothing you can do about it it's finished all right I believe that and like I said I believe what the prophet said when he said you come here with a seed in you I believe that I just don't believe what most people make that all right so we're laying down a lot of foundation now to be able to really understand predestination and understand how everything fits together all right now this past Sunday we were talking about what that brother Bram says page 80 of the old Hebrew is page two uh paragraph 2 um 79 of the Hebrew chapter 2 57 825 now these are not up so not these are just quotes that I've done before that I'm doing over he said the soul that was in the man the difference between a man and an animal God put a soul in a man he didn't put it in the animal he said because the soul that was in the man is that theophany all right now see we want to go with the thought then we were trying to express Sunday as we try to go over in the Corinth and we say but we have one waiting you know well I agree with that I believe that I believe the scriptures right right but I believe those that He predestinated those he called he's already done it that's right I believe it's already finished don't you as far as God is concerned amen all right we do have a theophany a finished theop would be the mind of God in reality but you got too much understanding see to pull away and that's what I'm trying to make see the prophet says your soul is you theophany he said well I don't believe that well he said that Jesus his soul his Spirit his theophany of his being message in tum 57 was what went to hell he said that Jesus preached to the souls in prison in the same kind of a body that he saw the glorified ones in the other night well now what was in hell did that was adoption 19 60 what did in other words we can believe that Jesus went and preached to the souls and prison right right we know the scripture says spirits but your Prophet said so because the word soul and Spirits interchangeable right all right so then why do we argue the point but Brother D I just can't see what you're getting at that your soul is your theophany well what is it come on what is a theophany what is a theophany you look up the word in your dictionary and it'll show you that it's the body of a deity right you know just simple language right all right you know we used to have in our soul the devil you agree with that right I believe that all right and he was our God and we served him amen and we were the body not talking about this now cuz you see that's where I don't believe like most people I believe the soul is a real you what your Prophet said if it's a real you it's more real than this body this spirit this wood this metal this anything but it's not your spirit is going to have to be destroyed one day it's not your body it's the soul the soul is a real you right well brother Dale I'm just a body spirit and soul that's what I am all right that's a TR being like God is father son Holy Ghost that's fine but remember it has to be divided right if it's not divided you got a problem right go tell me where sin lies and you tell me you don't sin I'm going to call you a liar and read to you what the Bible and the prophet says where he said he sinned every day so you can argue with him yeah but you just pull the quotes well what do you pull but see your soul is that real you that's right the Bible said All Souls Ezekiel 18:4 All Souls are mine Satan can't create right he only perverts he can't give you a soul that's right but he can pervert the nature right of your soul amen cuz that's what happened when we come into the world we born into the world see we're born as perfect as God can create which is no problems with it right but then Satan comes along and perverts the nature well brother Dale I've always just believ the Soul's just the nature of the spirit there is no quote the soul is just the nature of the spirit I want you to bring that to me see that means it's nothing but when you say the soul is the nature of the spirit now you're getting it correct cuz that's what the prophet said but you see people say well I know it's in there I've done this for 40 something years I want to read it I want to read it's just the nature of the spirit because that means it's just something floating around it's just nothing tangible nothing real it's just a nature of something bird dog horse cow whatever got a nature about it you know how to teach a bird dog to point he's born with a nature to do it but a hound dog if he points you better go run your lineage back he's got a bird dog somewhere right my brother-in-law we had he had an old dog at you know made it up with the wrong one and come out of it and boy there some of was pretty it was just an old hound but he one day we was all over there hunting on the side of the road bird hunting and and he had that old hound that was a bird dog looking and and that thing just standing on the road just right off the road just pointed right at these birds while these other dogs were pointing and Miss mam stopped well man he jumped out and he just looked at that dog and he said I want to buy it my brother long said it ain't for sale when that man left he had the bird dog my brother-in-law had every dime he had and the spark tire off his car see that nature some way went down through and it come out but see it's just just a nature that's what we want to make it but I've tried my best for 40 something years to preach to me a soul is the real you is what you are it will live on after you die don't fear him that can destroy the body right and spirit fear him that can destroy the soul why because only God can do that but Satan can't create but he perverts everything see that's when I trying to get to last Sunday brother randam says that the angel of the Lord is which he's referring to right in a message let me see if I can find it here but he said the angel of the Lord said solds under the altar cuz that's who he's talking to when he's beyond the curtain of time sold under the altar he said they were there in theophany that's right well well is the theophany in the soul is the soul in the or is it one brother brother said his soul his Spirit his theophany of his being and we know the body of Jesus never went to hell but it was his being is what we are yeah but I thought we had one beyond the curtain of time I mean Beyond I thought we had one up in heaven that's a positive God's mine that's simple we receive the new birth right right here at Faith does that mean you have the headstone no but it means you got a connection that's right and that headstone starts pulling yes that that's beyond the curtain of time is pulling you an eye amen see positive all right but see your soul then is your theophany and that being your theophany it's being it's the real you see you said but but brother Dale you you can't use uh Souls under the altar well brother Brandon was really easy to use it 1965 on things that uh trying to do God a service without his will he said if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting the good Heavenly Father permitted me to walk behind that curtain one day and see it have many heard the see look in a pis the curtain of time there it was just the same as I'm preaching to you all there they stood Soul under the altar crying how long not just a man myth but somebody who had intelligence but but but I I thought so on the alar was F you it is when you say to avenge our blood that's the way brother random defined it he said that's not the bride where it saids how long how long to avenge our blood he said we don't cry that we're forgiving people would you see then why is it we can't believe it 40 something years I've been trying to explain that Souls under the altar crying how long the soul of man is the real you right it's what you are you heard brother R said you can't see me he said I'm inside this body right something is motivating you and I amen right we either have an upper pull or an underpull you agree with that cuz that's what he said we're either being pulled down or we're pulled up that's right all right so that means that if we're going down we we're going to the wrong place but that's the soul see your body and your spirit is not the point because as I said about what is it Ezekiel when you get over there or what the scripture there where don't about I give you a new heart a new spirit that's right brother said that ain't the Holy Spirit he said give you a new heart he said because you can't stand yourself he said give you a new spirit it's not take your spirit out and put another spirit in no it's just working on the nature of it but he said then I put my spirit in you he said that's the Holy Spirit right I gave you the quote where brother around and said he sent back his soul on the day of Pentecost in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said when that's give out down through then the Rapture will come I'm not trying to deal with your body right not trying to deal with your spirit that's where most preachers preach and you know that's true that's right oh you need to do you need to do oh yeah and then like brother Ram like I said the other day brother said don't you go down too there and try to talk them people into coming to the Altar and begging them and telling them grandma died and goone to Heaven if you want to go to heaven with Grandma you got to go to you got to believe it he said don't do that amen what are you dealing with body and spirit right just walk right up to people and tell them you're lost right but brother Dale I love the Lord you love with your spirit that's right that's right that's one of the senses of your spirit that's right the soul only has one sense either Faith or doubt you're either born again or lost there's no gray area right there's no in between well I I've tried to do this yeah that's good that's started in the W that's cleaning out of that place for God to come to abide but you see what I'm talking about yes see then that way your soul is the real you and see like I said now go over it again he said but I thought it was up there well let me ask you a question the Bible says we have one Eternal in the heavens is that the scripture there in Corinthians now do you have eternal life up there and you have eternal life down here I mean you don't think like that I know but that's just my way of thinking if there's eternal life up there and eternal life down here I got a problem but if there's eternal life in here and God in heaven drawing me to that positive that I'm supposed to be then I got hopes because it's something real that's right it's not just a a a a myth or a thought brother brandom actually felt them people beyond the curtain of time he said they were there in their senses I even used to I didn't believe that I'm as honest as I can be I don't mind telling you you know because the reason I do it because that way maybe somebody else thought that away right I used to think that the soul of the individual you know beyond the curtain of time had no feelings but I kept reading that's right that's right and I kept reading and I found what the prophet said to do yes so I come to the church here and told you I was wrong because they are more real than we are those people beyond the curtain of time are more real than you and I you said well what are the end a theoy body which is their soul yes see your soul is what you really are your theophany body and those in hell are in their theophany brother R called it that come on yes you think it's not what about the adoption where he says only read part of it he preached to that same kind of body see he said they had senses now listen he he went to hell and preached to the souls in prison how did he do it he had senses of feeling he had sens of hearing he had senses of speech he preached with that same kind of body I saw those glorified ones in the other night he preached to the souls that were in Hell amen what were they in he went and preached that theophany that body that went and preached to the souls that were in prison and repented not in the longsuffering but see do we believe it see church I'm trying my best to preach eternal life eternal life is real I don't want just an anointing on my spirit amen I don't want to just say I love God come on I want his word I want his being of his person living in me right in a new birth see then I don't have to worry I'm not captivated by the world and the things of the world we live here okay but there's a difference in us why because something on the inside yes is different all right but listen church let me go on the end of the thought now that was just a background part I know it's been taught by most people in the message one form or the other about how that you were born with a seed in you and uh some teach that that seed was always Eternal you're two Soul people back there that's the reason when they were talking about two Souls I was studying about the soul of God and I tried to talk to him about it and he said well Soul just the nature of the spirit I said okay let's go over to souls in prison where brother BR said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again but said if it's not it's of the world World stand up in Jeffersonville Indiana the man looked at me said how can you how can you nature have a nature I said why don't you talk to the prophet he was the one that said it not me he'll tell you you know but you see church we just take quotes yes and just make a quote and think we know what we're talking about well let me give you a scripture and just see what you think Jesus one day said I chose you 12 that's right the Bible he said I chose you 12 he just got through talking about whether they were saying it was great you know this that and the other he said don't be do that but said Rejoice CU your name is written in heaven and he said I chose you 12 and he said one of you is the devil that's right that hit me the other dayk you father well now brother D what that is he chose for him to be the devil you've done messed up because you made God making him the devil and he didn't make him to devil so you just went wrong with it you better wake up he said I chose you judas's name was written in heaven he had a part of the ministry that's right and he said I chose you we'll get back to that one of these days cuz there's more to it than just that but I'm just leaving that see you say well you know you just quote a quote you just gra scripture why what's it doing so I believe all them quotes brother there where where brother Brown said was come here with a seed in US when was it put there according to why Christ speak 1963 7:14 the morning service which is after the opening of the seals right you God in his Mercy before the foundation of the World saw me and placed a little seed in there before the foundation of the world okay now was there anything physical before the foundation of the world well why is everybody want to deal with a physical seed we'll get back to that quote later month or two in the next year I guess but if you was born here with a seed in you where when would when was it put there well when I was born it was put there the prophet didn't say that he said it was put there before the foundation of the world now then with all that in mind I ask you a simple question what is the seed of God what is the seed of God does God have a literal uh how can I say it uh 16 elements human you know whatever or does he create did he have 16 elements or did he create 16 elements so what is the seed of God we said well the seat of God is the word of God Amen we're going to we're going to talk about that but we're going to talk about it in a way that maybe you hadn't thought of what is the seed of God so then I'm asking you the question does God have a literal seed or does he create now if you're going to go to a had a literal then you got a problem with the Virgin Mary and and you're going to have to have God having intercourse with Mary uh plain but true it's true that's right but if it's his word that can create that's right then he created that's right in the wound of Mary the egg and The Germ right just don't think that I'm not making it the way that it is true because listen God is more real than any tangible elements we can think of that's right I've tried my best to get you to see that oh God is a spirit is he just floating around now brother brand said he's a being right he's not like the wind he says he said he's really not even omnipresent present see if it was wind it could just be everywhere he said because he's a being right right but said he's omnipresent in the basis he's omniscient he knows to be there if there's anybody up on the moon he has to be up there to make a record that's right but if there's nobody up there they don't have to be up there but you see that's what I'm trying to get you to see he's real and get you to see the new birth is real yes amen it's not an imagination or a thought or a good concept or or change of life amen it's not an alcoholic synonymous that puts you through rules and or like the school are today trying to make the kids s to to remain you know virgins try to make them to make commitments because they've learned if they get them to make commitments and they get 10,000 to make them about one or two will keep it but how real is God to you well brother D it's just a Spirit came in me praise the Lord I remember brother Tatum I remember a lot of your experiences remember brother Tatum sitting out I believe was under an apple tree I'm not certain but he's sitting there and he said just like raindrops falling on you oh glory to I believe in that I believe in that I believe in his presence I've smelled him I've seen him i' I don't have to worry about it I know he's real but he's more real than just the thoughts of your mind that's right that's right think on it what is thece of God if he doesn't have a physical mankind like elements of that but that his elements are so much greater than this to leave a theophany brother Brandman explaining it I've read it to you over and over he said a better eye that theop body has a better eye he said a better sense of hearing and feelings and things in a theophany but you see Church what is God's seed he said well that's his word well amen all right now let's take that thought and dwell on it maybe the rest of the whole day because what does it mean to say that God's the seed is the word of God go ahead and pull up number two I guess it's Satan does not have a seed we've been through that you remember you remember how we brought it out from the church a book that Satan doesn't have a seed because he could not enter the human race that's right of a seed he's an Angelic being the prophet says he doesn't have a soul that's right yet there is a quote brother around said about his soul he doesn't have a body as a man yet the Bible says he's a man but what's it describing he's an Angelic being Angels don't have souls even the Beast what he had a place for a soul but he didn't have one but here comes Cain with a soul why because God created he said All Souls are mine right right so then Satan cannot create cuz he's an Angelic being but God is not to just say an Angelic being God is real and he can create yes and did create world and all kind of I've got one somewhere that I'd love it I looking at it this morning again where brother brother Brown talking about the word of God and how that he spoke them things into existence and he said he didn't have anywh for it to come from he said but his word said it the Bible says what did he created out of right it wasn't something somewhere else for him to create it from that's right he spoke his word look what he says here in Luke in our thought Luke 8 verse 9-15 and this is the parable now this is not the parable there you remember there's two ways of expressing the parable one of them is the so went forth the SE and it's the children of the Kingdom we'll get to that all right but then he got the tires which is the children of the wicked we'll get to that all right but this is the parable of the so that went forth to seow and what what he said and his disciples asked him saying what might this Parable be and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of God those by the wayside are they that hear we'll get to that in a few minutes remember they here then comes to devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts now are you going to tell me that the Pharisees didn't have the letter Perfect come on they had it letter perfect right and killed the god of the word okay but you see those by the wayside are they that he here then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved and they on the rocks are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which were a while believe in the time of Temptation fall away and they which fell among Thorns are they when they have heard go forth preachers right and are choke with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection that's right now are you with me yes they have the word the Pharisees had the word right see one of these days you're going to find out what brother R was saying and you're going to realize he's right he said the Baptist has got the word now bless God they don't have the word they don't they they believe your Prophet said it they read the same Bible you read they have the letter of the word the letter of the word says baptize in the name of the father of the Son and the Holy Ghost that's right and that's what they do amen yes but they just don't know the truth how much do we know why there so much split in this message oh my when there's only one message I used to bother me when I was in the Baptist why there was so many different denominations in one Bible I come in this message find out they worse than all of the denominations there was put together but think about it and they bring no fruit Ro to Perfection so evidently they get started right come on why does the bible say that that's right it starts growing but the cares of life and things choke it out right I planted okra this year it rained so much the okra came up it like that but the weeds was like that so when it finished up the weeds was like this and the okra was somewhere in there and the bushog got the rest of it cuz it was nothing I could get to are you looking at it when they have heard go forth how about all the people in this message you can think of that stuck with it for a while yes and what about now right when they're falling away like crazy yeah if you don't believe that go home look on the internet and see and boy they're proving him to be wrong they proving this to be that they arguing over that this that or the other the people that were the ones that brought you and I into the message right amen right all right these people start and it grows a little but then all the things takes over verse 15 but that on the good ground are they which in an honest heart on excuse me and good heart like that having heard the word keep it how long did they keep it about 3 and 1/2 years right are we talking about the disciples and then how long did you hear it and keep it but how long did the disciples keep the word and keep it remember what they said we don't know he said why don't you go to you know rest of them go in 70 walked away he said why don't you go well a one thing left we know you got the word of eternal life and we just going to hang around right and keep it and bring forth fruit with patience so what is the seat of God me this afternoon I know now but is everything you read out of the Bible now I'm asking you a question and you're going to have to bear withen now when you sit down and read the Bible do you believe that's the word of God Amen that's fine that's good but can the word of God say baptize in the name of father son Holy Ghost and Lord Jesus Christ you see that's why I'm glad God sent a prophet right cuz you know what the prophet said one day he said the only way you can baptize in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost is to baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right you notice when I baptize you what I say to fulfill the Great commission to baptize you in the name of the Father the Son I now baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you so bless God I don't want to be baptized no father son Holy Ghost if you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you got to be baptized in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost or either you're saying one's wrong the other one's right now you're arguing with the word come on you're arguing with the word remember we're talking about the seat of God so does it save you to hear the word now you got to hear it but does it save you to hear it something's got to happen to it right now I know I won't get to it this morning but why is it I I heard it so many times in the Baptist Church preached in Romans 8 I believe it is or 6 or8 where it talks about the word and and the things you hear and and the the you know with your mouth you can f yes I heard that so many times I didn't really want to read it I'm honest I'm calling up brother Tatum brother Tatum said he began to hear about it and he said I used to read Matthew 28:19 and he said I'd get over to acts 238 he said I'd turn real fast I got some tickle cuz I know what he's talking about amen but see it's not just believing in your heart if you believe in your heart won't confess with your mouth what are you hypocrite that's right not saved that's right but why is it that everybody that says you know what I'm talking about alter call and people come up do you believe that Jesus Christ is Son of God yes I believe it why is it that everybody's not saved it says that right you know that is God's word may me not letter you know verbatims but you know what I'm talking about what's the problem so it must be that letters on a page is not what the Bible is we get today a while or this afternoon because Paul said what he said the letter kth that's right the spirit giveth life now why is it I'm asking you a question now anointed ones or Anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit you agree do we need to go back and prove all that we've been through all of it you agree anointed ones are anointed with a genuine Holy Spirit if that Holy Spirit can come down upon you and anoint you come on why did it not give life to the word come on cuz you're not talking about anointing falling out here just average Joe person walking down the road right you're talking about religious real right you know when he says he poured out his Spirit upon All Flesh that doesn't mean he poured out on every body right he pour it out on the religious part right why is it that that anointing does not give life to the word they you me all of us we walk down to the Altar and the preacher said do you believe that Jesus Christ is a Son of God and he died for your sins and you say yes well is it not true that the biggest portion some receive the Holy Ghost right there right and you B you age but the biggest Fortune don't why and brother randam says you find any promise in this book and you call God on the scene now do you need this quote he said God's obligated come on why don't it happen the anointing is there right am I right the anointing is there why did it not Quicken the word back in our scripture in Luke one about those that took the word and they held it for a while when the Holy Ghost fail Why didn't it give them eternal life so then I'm asking you the question what do you mean Lord Prophet what do you mean when you say the word of God is his seed now oh my Lord you do no this is four hours later when you can take and make a grain of corn that looks identical right makes the same amount of corn flakes cornbread whatever but you plant it and it won't give life everything is perfectly exactly the same and recording brother brandom the pulp Etc the things within it playing the shell outside and then the inside and the part but it won't live why because it don't have no germ right amen so then the letter kth Paul said why why does the letter kth don't on Jer but yet what he was talking about was the word of God that does have the germs you know germ in it why did the Pharisees kill Jesus when they knew the letter of the word and they knew Isaiah right they knew the scriptures what was wrong with him is it possible to have the word and the word how no germ you're quiet that's good you're either asleep or you thinking if you snore we'll find out you asleep but I'm just asking a simple question I'm so deep to people don't understand me and I'm asking the most simple question in the world why is it that the word that we hear does not convert US come on don't get me wrong now you got to hear the word first don't start off with your computer running that's right stay with me you could at least afford to do that much you want the internet or whatever you are you could at least stay with me and say well let me listen to what he's talking about whether I agree with him or not father Son and Holy Ghost is in the word of Goden and you know that God winked at ignorance and allowed people in the body they was baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost right right and he may be winking now because that's all people can hear but you know what I'm talking about in this day it'd be hard to say that he's winking in ignorance because the radio broadcast the things but I don't care why I bless God I don't want to listen to that old junk now what you mean is you don't want to admit what the truth is you're afraid to listen but now if you go out too much listening you're going to get caught with their doctorine so go ahead find the middle of the road amen come on you go too far you went off that way you go too far you're off the word is a seed that's right it needs moisture right are we right uh what is the moisture to the word the Holy Spirit you agree you agree that the moisture is the holy spirit well how come anointed ones don't get the New Birth come on let me say that again because your mind's running why is it that the anointing of the Holy Spirit can come down on a person and not make the word alive simple questions but yeah we say well I know what it is the word of God is a seed or the seed is the word of God I wish you'd go back and listen to a spoken word Original Seed you know might help you that's right CU even the title of the message is wonderful the spoken word is the Original Seed that's right now come on he didn't say the word is the seed like we're thinking he says the spoken word is the Original Seed that's good okay but why is it that we can take the word now how many will admit that you because we all talk like this right that I read the Bible I read the prophet's message I read this and I read that and all at once once something jumped off the page right did everybody agree with that you know you you're hearing it and all it's all at once it just something happened that's right right I mean you agree with that yes well what happened I mean did the letter change no what happened the seed of God what is the seed of God is it letters on a page but then you got to be careful because see everybody wants to say well what it is you got to read between the lines well that's good I I know the quotes all right okay I know know what the prophet said about read between the line and I believe it agree with it but you know reading between the lines can't be different than what the line says now you agree with that cuz that's what he said that's right reading between the lines just jumps it off the page into your heart but you see that's what people say another gir back there we was eating one night and Sister Margaret and it was all this about the seventh seal is this and seventh seal is that and brother the G said well if that's true I can take the seventh seal and just say I can marry as many times I want to and see he could be I'm reading between the lines but see the lines don't say that so that's not between the lines and Sister Margaret said if you get that I get a revelation I take my 37 and blow your head off I said Sister Margaret I agree with you but you see we think that we know what it is what brother tell his word is his seed well how come it don't come up but you better remember now also where Paul said the letter kth I got it in here to read but remember what he was saying when he got to saying the letter kill it you know what he said he began to talk about faith cometh by hearing right brother D I don't need a preacher I can get it myself I want scripture for it that's right not trying to enhance mine because I don't get no different if there's 10,000 wasn't out there listening today then just remember I don't get a dime from you so it ain't helping me at all right I'm just trying to be honest see I can read you all of these quotes where brother brandham goes through explaining the seed is his word all right but what about it his seed is his word and Faith cometh by hearing that's right amen and what's the rest of that scripture and how can they hear without a preacher bless God ain't no preacher taught me this message I got the book you you you want what' you say I got a tape and I got a book uh uh somebody was on that tape in writing that book uh right ain't no preacher bless God well and ain't helping me or doing away women either way don't change me so I don't have to to worry about but I want you to show where you got it at because you got it from somebody amen cuz the Bible says everything we have what we receive that's right yes sir going back off because I'm going too far in Isaiah I'm going to say this and then back up I believe it's 9:6 isn't it where he talking about the a child is born what if that had never been put in the Bible you see folks we we're dwelling on a lot of things people take well brother random is a prophet I love everything he says but how do you love it he was preaching one day and it hit me and I said Glory Hallelujah now I know what I'm depending on you know what he said he got in the Rapture message and he said it has been spoken now let it come to pass that's right yes sir do you realize if he hadn't said that there would be no Rapture right come on don't play with me with words Paul's prophecy was a prophecy right change them on twinkle an eye you remember that but that was a prophecy why because he never experienced it somebody's going to experience a Rapture because the prophet of God that I believe in spoke it that's right that's right remember James is it no it's not what is it Amos 3 and 7 about the word comes to the prophet amen now that word coming to a prophet you know before it's a word it's a thought are you with me before it's a word it's a thought brother Bram said I don't know where he's holding up the Bible or not but he's referring he said this is God's thought that he has put in the Bible now if somebody don't pick that up then is it the word remember it's thought first then word you say yeah but in the beginning was the word amen you're in Genesis 1 thank you before then it was a thought and then it was FOC Spen remember the title I ask you to listen to the message and ask you to listen to the title The spoken word is the Original Seed Brother D I don't all I believe is it just I I believe the word is a seed well why is it not not alive come on remember to be a seed that is worth anything the grain of corn illustration remember the difference is the germ of life you agree now I said I'm braing off so just back up with me how did that germ get in that seed simple question we'll back up cuz you see I know that I've Advanced way over in my thought but it's there that'll help you to understand how that the seed of God is God's word but remember Matthew 28:19 is God's word and The Germ of life is in it Lord Jesus no it ain't in Matthew 28:19 that's the den they take the they take Matthew 28:19 we take acts 238 Ah that's garbage K if you don't go brother random said by Matthew 28:19 you are not baptized correctly come on that's right well brother down which way I need to be I've told you how I baptized cuz I found one day that's where the prophet said it right that's the reason I do it I say to fulfill the Great Commission of Matthew 28:19 right to baptize in name Father Son and Holy Ghost I now baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right see I fulfilled it right but Matthew 28:19 is a germ of God it is a word you realize if if Mary hadn't said be it unto me according to Thy word that have never been a savior appar he' got somebody else yeah he probably could have got you I hope that goes all good on the internet the way my picture is cuz that's how silly I think you want to believe in predestination then there was nobody in the world right could say that but Mary that's right I don't care how many times anybody else said it it never produced they were teaching the just shall live by faith before Martin Luther study your history they were protesting the Catholic Church before Martin Luther but the best they could do was burn churches that's why what they thought but think about it brother random says on the message now if they throw these fight enough to read them that's fine if they don't you ought to know it chice the father 1950 he said the seed of God the seed is the word of God the S is the son of man the field is the earth and the seed is the word of God Amen notice this seed is the word of God it's if it's whatever God's word says it's a seed Hebrews chapter 6 1957 the seed of God is the word of God faith comth by hearing hearing the word come on he just said this he is the word of God what do you need to hear and what does it say how can they hear without a preacher I didn't write that but you want to te it out that's what a man told me one time he said them gifts and things in in uh there in Corinthians 13 or whatever he said that ought be T out of word I said give me your Bible he know better than hand me that Bible I'd give him $500 to bought him a brand new one the best company found in the world I was going to tear them Pages out cuz he said it had no need of being in there I said let me have it bu you better believe he wouldn't let me have it cuz he knew me I'd have just ripped it out and said here's money go buy you a new one that's being sarcastic and hate when no that's just being plain sorry to be plain but at least you don't play around knowing that I'm trying to pull something over on you that's right see the descript in 1965 the seed of God the word of God Jesus said in a certain place that the word is a seed and every seed will bring forth of its kind and now if the Christian the children of God the children of the Kingdom has become the seed of God then they must be the word of God you read the word of God manifested in the age that they're living in by the promised seed of that age he goes on down he talk about Moses he was the seed of God at that time we're going to get to it this evening but we're going to have to stop because it's late we're going to get to finding out that the seed comes through the body that's right that's what your Prophet said if you got any sense you know it does now don't get technical with me and say we're in the days of test Tu babies they come from somebody get it off presuming 1962 what is it how are you going to have a Revival upon that when you're SE in Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostal and Presbyterian seed and denying the seed of God the word Jesus said the word is a seed the Bible God's word is the seed how you going to bring forth a bible church with a denominational seed now what is a denominational seed he said it wouldn't work he said a denominational seed to produce a denomination every time you agree right amen now I I don't I don't get the story so I'll finish a few minutes saying it uh they read the same Bible we read right I I mean when you come into message did you get a different Bible I don't mean you decided you want to change from scoffield to Thompson Chain I ain't goofy I'm talking about was you reading a Bible and then the next day you went bought you a new one that was a spoken word you see church then if anything is contrary to the truly revealed word it's a denominational Doctrine right you can call it two Soul seventh under virtue perusia you can call it anything you want to if it ain't the word it's a denominational seed Lula or anything you want to call got a postcard I think Anna did the other day talking about us Lula I that's fine but what about it you can't have a Revival what was the story in the spoken word is Original Seed he said you say you've had the rain he said there's a former and a latter rain he said you say you've had the rain the latter rain he said nonsense he said cause you haven't had the former Reign the teaching rain he said you sown your own seed go home and listen to the T please I ask you to read the book he said you can't have the former the latter Reign until you have the former and he said that's why your Reigns is not brought Christ to the church no that's what he said he said because you you taught denominational seed now what is denominational seed like I said I mean when you you got it you went and got a new Bible and you come into the message and and uh and you you read and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose well I read that before didn't you but you see it's possible to have the letter in your possession without it having the germ of life okay how can you do that when a seed remember it takes a union to make a seed is that the prophet's words I give it to you the other day and let me ask you a simple question I'll close Jesus said to the people that looking at them that could take the Scrolls and stick a pen through them and tell you every letter that it went through that's just showing how much he read that's right that's all he done all her life is read the Scrolls right Jesus said one day he said you are of your father the devil right then he turned around and he made an outstanding statement that I wish you to ponder over until this afternoon maybe he said my words are spirit and their life that's right he read the same scroll right brother Dale you that's what I want to do I want to confuse you so much till you'll either just leave out of here and go away and we don't have to worry about building another church or nothing or either you'll go home and sit down and think what is this man talking about standing looking in them fire his face that could quote him every word he says my words our spirit and their life you know what he was telling them you don't have no germ so your words is letter on a page amen letters on the page don't have no germ in it let's stand what is the seed of God well it's the word of God it's the word of God why would Jesus say my words are Spirit in their life in other words everything he said was it spirit and life and all they they had was he he only said what the word said right why would you make that statement and you agreed with it while ago why would it be that that you could read and read and read and read something over and over and over and over and over and over just keep read read it over and over and over and over over and over and then one day something just jumps off the page right into your heart that's right did the letter change you picked up a germ come on we get to it this evening you picked up a germ something became spirit and life that's right brother BR said that a body laid in the Tomb without any life in it until the Spirit came he said the 120 laid in the upper room Little Seeds he said there's no life that's what he said if you don't have the germ of Life the Holy Ghost don't do it no good holy ghost coming down on you anoints the seed The Germ to make it alive what are we doing go ahead brother 192 we going sing this just a verse or something now because it's 3 minutes till
