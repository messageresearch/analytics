[30:28] through through the side that we're on
[30:31] of life and all we get to where we don't
[30:33] need them as much and they're they're
[30:35] not as valuable so uh you know we get

[31:26] us father in your Your Love in Jesus
[31:29] name amen amen
[31:36] Ephesians one we'll begin reading at
[31:39] verse
[31:43] three blessed be the God and father of
[31:45] our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us
[31:47] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[31:50] places in Christ according as he has
[31:53] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[31:56] of the world that we should be holy
[31:58] Without Blame before him in love having
[32:00] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[32:03] children by jus Jesus Christ to himself
[32:06] according to the good pleasure of his
[32:08] will to the praise of the glory of his
[32:11] grace wherein he ha accepted Us in the
[32:14] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[32:16] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[32:18] sins according to the riches of his
[32:21] grace wherein he hath abounded toward us
[32:23] in all wisdom and Prudence having made
[32:26] known unto us the mystery of his word
[32:27] will according to his good pleasure
[32:29] which he hath purposed in himself that
[32:32] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[32:35] time now here's the mystery that in the
[32:37] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[32:40] might gather together in one all things
[32:43] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[32:45] which are on earth even in him in whom
[32:48] also we have obtained an inheritance
[32:51] being predestinated according to the
[32:53] purpose of him who worketh all things
[32:55] after the counsel of his own will that
[32:59] we should be to the praise of his glory
[33:01] who first trusted in Christ you may be
[33:04] seated the Lord at his Blessing to the
[33:06] reading of the word here's about four
[33:09] copies of Sunday that Sunday's so if
[33:13] anybody didn't get a copy somebody here
[33:15] tonight didn't get a copy of the uh
[33:18] quotes from Sunday I made a few there to
[33:20] where we could could U do it now what is
[33:24] the key that
[33:26] we or what did I say we would be
[33:29] bringing out basically in ever service
[33:32] in this series that we'll be trying to
[33:35] bring uh on
[33:39] predestination and it's the one thing to
[33:41] me that is the key to understanding all
[33:43] things let alone predestination the
[33:46] entire Bible all things is to be
[33:48] understood by one thing what that God
[33:51] knows all
[33:54] things he's never had a new thought
[33:59] all of his thoughts are
[34:01] perfect can't be added to cuz it was he
[34:04] wouldn't be God he would be like me and
[34:06] you he would be uh gaining some form of
[34:09] knowledge or some way but he doesn't and
[34:12] that's the key see if if you get that
[34:14] into your mind and just say God knows
[34:17] all
[34:18] things amen but see we we come down into
[34:22] predestination and and like I said the
[34:25] prophet there was talking about it SU
[34:28] that he said there's a lot of of messed
[34:32] up doctrines about
[34:33] predestination you know and see then
[34:36] that way people don't go for the to the
[34:40] way of looking at it because if you
[34:42] approach
[34:44] predestination to me now this is the way
[34:46] I believe it if you approach it in any
[34:49] other form than to approach it in the
[34:51] bases of forn
[34:54] knowledge right then you got to great uh
[34:59] opportunity for further
[35:03] advancement you
[35:05] know but if you approach it without forn
[35:08] knowledge then you've cut off your whole
[35:10] channel right all right so then an all
[35:14] knowing god or what's the matter with
[35:17] your God that doesn't know all
[35:19] things well he just knows some things
[35:22] you know he just well I guess he knows a
[35:25] little bit well you got a little bit of
[35:27] a god
[35:28] that's the best way to say it because
[35:30] your God has some kind of a peanut brain
[35:32] like the rest of us but see now I know
[35:35] what brother brandom
[35:38] said and I understand but you still try
[35:41] to do the best you can to help people to
[35:45] understand I know the prophet of God
[35:47] said he said if you're not predestinated
[35:49] to see it right you'll never see
[35:52] it h and I know that and I realize
[35:56] preaching to people you know that
[35:59] everybody is not going to understand
[36:02] what you're talking about I mean I
[36:04] understand that I that's why I keep
[36:08] repeating keep repeating keep going over
[36:11] it over it and over it because that way
[36:15] see then if I'm wrong then I can be
[36:19] corrected if I'll listen to what
[36:20] somebody else has to say but if I'm
[36:23] right in what I'm saying then if I keep
[36:25] repeating it long enough maybe it will
[36:28] drop down within us to where that God
[36:31] can reveal it but see that's what I
[36:34] think about
[36:36] predestination to me predestination is
[36:38] the most simple thing that I could ever
[36:41] think of I wish that a lot of the other
[36:44] doctrinal things you call it like one
[36:46] God you know different things would be
[36:49] uh is easily understood as
[36:52] predestination that's right because it
[36:55] simply is based upon the fact of whether
[36:57] or not God knows all things
[37:01] right and if he knows all
[37:04] things then all we've got to do is
[37:07] listen to the
[37:10] scriptures as it defines things to
[37:14] us and that way then we can you know get
[37:18] an understanding out of it all right
[37:22] like second Peter 3
[37:25] and9 that God is not willing that any
[37:28] should
[37:31] perish right he's not willing that any
[37:34] should
[37:35] perish all right then that should set
[37:38] our thoughts in a
[37:40] direction to where that we can think on
[37:44] these things that he's not willing
[37:47] now and that he didn't make
[37:51] anybody make a
[37:55] choice all right
[37:58] and we gave them to you there on the
[38:00] morning service and some of you have
[38:02] them there like brother brandom says
[38:04] that uh paragra 10 a super sign he said
[38:07] he don't predestinate according
[38:10] to that's right his desires right that's
[38:14] right that's
[38:16] right cuz he desired that every person
[38:19] in the world should be
[38:21] saved paragraph 122 Harvest Time right
[38:26] not willing that any should perish e E15
[38:29] Queen of Sheba all right if he's not
[38:32] willing that any
[38:35] perish why would our minds be set in the
[38:38] wrong
[38:40] channel
[38:42] of
[38:44] understanding and why not place it in
[38:47] the correct channel right but it's just
[38:49] like all other
[38:51] doctrines the Bible in nowhere in the
[38:53] world has ever taught three Gods two
[38:56] four or have many people come up with
[38:59] you know they have Tess foress and
[39:01] Oneness and it never taught three Gods
[39:06] right it never taught a Oneness doctrine
[39:10] that mankind has come up with right the
[39:13] Bible didn't teach
[39:14] it brother random didn't come and give
[39:17] us a new
[39:20] Bible I still have the Bible that I was
[39:23] reading before I heard of this
[39:26] message you know the pages didn't change
[39:30] you know the words didn't change right
[39:32] you know what
[39:34] changed my understanding that's right
[39:38] amen now then if if if God wanted
[39:42] everybody to be saved then he had to
[39:45] make a way that everybody could be saved
[39:51] right are you listening right right you
[39:54] know Sunday I was more reading a lot and
[39:57] I still read a lot tonight but I want
[39:58] you to think on a couple of items about
[40:06] predestination if God wanted everybody
[40:08] saved and you can't say he didn't that's
[40:11] right oh see they got this great
[40:13] doctrines in the message you know that
[40:15] we was his seed and only the seed you
[40:19] know well we'll get down to that one of
[40:21] these days and see what the prophet is
[40:23] really talking about amen you know we've
[40:26] been through it enough enough on it
[40:28] before but just think on these things
[40:31] brother brandham said
[40:33] on faith of Abraham in 1955 he said he
[40:36] never made Esau the way he was right
[40:40] that's
[40:42] right he gave Esau a
[40:45] choice he even says now I didn't bring
[40:48] you this but anybody can find it he said
[40:52] that Cain had a choice
[40:56] right
[40:57] and we'll get down to it one of these
[40:59] days to bring out a few more points on
[41:00] it but brother brandham I was listening
[41:03] to him the other day we was about where
[41:04] he said that Moses are reading the quote
[41:08] where he said Moses was born with this
[41:10] great
[41:13] gift but you know what the next few
[41:15] words he
[41:17] said he said
[41:19] everybody was born with that
[41:26] gift he said everybody was born with
[41:30] it he said yeah but brother it was
[41:32] according to this longing
[41:35] desire brother Brandon said every Mortal
[41:38] human being no matter if he's a hot and
[41:40] tot in Africa that has never seen or
[41:44] heard about Jesus Christ in any form or
[41:47] or God in any way and he worshiped idols
[41:50] and things like that but said he's got a
[41:52] conscience right and said he's got a
[41:55] desire Within him to serve God
[42:02] right he had to do that to give him a
[42:06] choice right so if he didn't
[42:09] predestinate as we think you
[42:13] know he must have done it according to
[42:15] where that he wouldn't be nobody in the
[42:17] Bible we'll get down to that scripture
[42:19] in a minute in Romans there but see the
[42:23] Bible says the thing formed can't say
[42:25] why did you form me this way that's
[42:27] right amen
[42:29] mm if he forms you wrong he can't judge
[42:32] you for being wrong amen that's
[42:35] right but if he gave us a choice and we
[42:39] took the choice and went wrong
[42:42] right then he could predetermine the
[42:47] destiny because of his for
[42:51] knowledge yes it's simple to me go that
[42:56] way the brother R say on where I think
[42:58] Pentecost failed 1955 God didn't say now
[43:02] I'll make this man by this and I'll make
[43:07] this man be
[43:10] that he didn't do it how'd he do it all
[43:14] of those has it on it if you didn't get
[43:17] a copy you have one all of that has on
[43:20] there that he predestines before
[43:22] knowledge that's
[43:24] right well that's just an old
[43:27] denominational Doctrine we're over into
[43:29] the great
[43:30] Revelation you can't leave the word of
[43:34] God that says those who he forne he did
[43:37] predestinate yes
[43:39] sir see when you leave the word of God
[43:41] you have no basis you have just your own
[43:45] ideas and that's what man has done and
[43:47] why you come up with all of these
[43:49] doctrines y
[43:52] right and it's not like my brother says
[43:54] and I gave you a quote of God's Covenant
[43:57] with Abraham 1956 that Jesus didn't just
[44:00] come to Calvary like on a halfhazard
[44:03] basis and just say well you know uh I'll
[44:07] go down and die that's what my brother
[44:09] says and it's in the same almost quote
[44:11] I'll go down and die and maybe
[44:14] somebody will be
[44:17] saved right he said now he didn't do it
[44:19] that
[44:22] way he even says to you and I that he
[44:25] didn't put us in a tube and push through
[44:27] it that's right amen we still have a
[44:29] desire right amen you know we still do
[44:32] it God doesn't predestinate according to
[44:34] his desires so what did we find he
[44:37] predestines according to your desires
[44:43] right now that way see then you can't
[44:45] blame him for being what you
[44:47] are that's right if he predestines
[44:50] according to my desires and my desires
[44:52] is wrong then he can't you know he
[44:55] didn't make me that way right right you
[44:58] say yeah but there's people here that he
[45:00] didn't give a choice and there's people
[45:02] there
[45:03] see act a denominational Doctrine see
[45:06] right amen but see in the message you
[45:08] got to you can plug up those loopholes
[45:10] by the prophet saying listen he said
[45:14] those people out there in the jungles
[45:16] that had never
[45:18] heard he said they'll be judged
[45:20] according to their own
[45:23] laws you want those
[45:25] quotes
[45:28] they'll be judged according to their
[45:30] laws and how they
[45:33] done well ain't nobody going to happen
[45:36] but they at born
[45:41] again that's the way we got our ideas
[45:46] right they come to find out there's
[45:48] going to be a lot of people in heaven
[45:49] there's going to be foolish virgin
[45:50] that's going to be there and there's
[45:51] going to be a fifth seal Jew that's
[45:53] going to be there there going to be a
[45:55] lot of people in heaven that didn't
[45:56] receive ET Turnal life while they was
[45:57] here
[45:59] right but you see do we believe that or
[46:03] do we still
[46:04] believe what mama
[46:07] said Just remember Mama was under a
[46:10] different age that's right she wasn't
[46:12] under the understanding of the end time
[46:18] right but God keeps his word 1957 he
[46:21] said that God would say well maybe
[46:24] somebody will feel sorry for me
[46:27] and get
[46:30] saved now that's not correct
[46:39] right neither would he page 37 or e37
[46:44] five Junctions of time 50 1956 he
[46:47] wouldn't just that deliberately turn you
[46:52] away right as I said he said to Cain
[46:56] would you not have been
[46:59] accepted had you done what your brother
[47:02] done that's
[47:04] right we think Judas was such a bad guy
[47:07] like I've always say I don't I'm not on
[47:09] all of this garbage kin the world's got
[47:11] about it I'm just telling the truth the
[47:13] way I see it right Judas had an
[47:16] opportunity right and Judas didn't do no
[47:19] worse than Peter did
[47:22] right so Judas introduced Jesus
[47:28] to
[47:30] Pilot right
[47:32] right Peter
[47:35] denied of him being who he was that's
[47:39] right but yet we want to take up for
[47:41] Peter and draw up on Judas no I'm just
[47:44] just like I am I'm just what I am I just
[47:46] look at it straight he gave Judas Judas
[47:49] had an opportunity right until Satan
[47:52] entered into him that
[47:54] night that's right
[47:57] and even after he done
[48:00] that he had more gumption than Peter or
[48:03] any of us has ever had cuz you know what
[48:05] he done he went killed
[48:09] himself but yet we don't look at it on
[48:11] that
[48:12] basis we want make it some kind of a
[48:15] doctrinal thing that what makes it a
[48:17] great big
[48:20] thing we don't want to go back and just
[48:23] look at it like it is as I said all of
[48:27] these has got on them that you're
[48:29] predestinated by full knowledge
[48:34] right God never predetermined anything
[48:38] apart from for knowledge right amen
[48:40] that's right I thought they was this
[48:42] great thing that's see that's where
[48:45] you're still
[48:46] thinking Eve didn't have a right to do
[48:48] it and you and I don't
[48:51] either but you see we put our own
[48:53] thoughts in
[48:55] there
[48:57] cuz we don't really now I thought of
[49:00] this today and I'm going to just be
[49:02] honest and talk a little while to you
[49:04] you know we don't honestly want it to
[49:06] think about it being by for
[49:11] knowledge why would people reject the
[49:14] thought when the biggest portion of this
[49:16] message you know it's true they reject
[49:19] for knowledge they go to
[49:22] predetermining they
[49:24] reject of people in the bride having a
[49:27] choice right they say that's for the
[49:31] denominations brother randam said I'm
[49:33] glad the Bible didn't say William brand
[49:36] I gave you a couple there Sunday right
[49:38] amen he said I'm glad it said whosoever
[49:41] will right amen he said because then
[49:44] that could be me but said it might be
[49:46] more William Brandon right but see we
[49:49] don't like them
[49:51] quotes but why is it what's the trouble
[49:54] about for
[49:55] knowledge
[49:58] why would it not be the most simple
[50:00] thing to think about that God if the
[50:03] prophet is right in the Bible's
[50:06] right that he would that everybody be
[50:09] saved
[50:11] Y and that he wouldn't predestinate
[50:14] according to his own desires cuz he
[50:16] desired that everybody be
[50:19] saved why would we have trouble with for
[50:25] knowledge exuse me I know I'm not going
[50:28] to get on the rest of the message part
[50:30] of it
[50:32] but let's just talk a little bit about
[50:34] it
[50:36] amen why would you not be over joyously
[50:40] as brother Rand said I was reading two
[50:42] or three of them in there and he said
[50:43] don't that just make you feel so
[50:45] great this feels so wonderful to thank
[50:49] that God for
[50:52] new and would predestinate according to
[50:55] his full knowledge
[50:59] yes see then what would he for
[51:04] know why would we be so why should we be
[51:07] so happy about a forn
[51:14] knowledge because he's working according
[51:16] to your desires
[51:19] right right
[51:22] amen then you must have thought
[51:24] something about our desires
[51:31] you know
[51:34] right he knew the prophet
[51:37] said that somebody would want to be
[51:40] saved said thereby he devised a
[51:47] plan and devising the plan then he could
[51:50] manifest himself as as a Healer as a
[51:54] savior and fulfill his attribut
[52:02] right but now just remember one of these
[52:05] days we're going to get down to we're
[52:06] going to back up into heaven with this
[52:08] thing and talk about it a little bit in
[52:10] a deeper way than brother Dale's ever
[52:12] talked before to you
[52:14] so but you can't byass for knowledge
[52:18] that's right amen if you do it where is
[52:22] your basis to put it
[52:25] upon
[52:29] oh but brother Dale you don't understand
[52:30] a great plan and
[52:34] purpose I gave you one out of that
[52:36] message Christ a Myster God
[52:40] reveal what brother Rand says on page
[52:43] 50 he said God never just said I'll
[52:46] choose one y this one or that
[52:52] one right he said it was to fulfill the
[52:55] mystery
[53:00] okay
[53:01] now why would we not want to think about
[53:04] for
[53:11] knowledge why wouldn't we want to think
[53:13] about
[53:18] that cuz you know what four knowledge
[53:20] deals
[53:22] with knowing what you would do and won't
[53:25] do right
[53:27] right you know what then if he
[53:29] predestines according to for knowledge
[53:32] then he knew what we do and what we
[53:34] wouldn't do right
[53:41] right for
[53:46] knowledge and then brother colie he knew
[53:48] that you
[53:50] would get
[53:53] ready go over and pick up
[53:55] Duty I guess you did today
[54:00] in and
[54:01] you'd come to
[54:07] church
[54:12] why why did you come with
[54:22] church is it some Book of
[54:25] Rules
[54:30] is it
[54:34] that you're going to get 10 demerits on
[54:37] your report card because you don't you
[54:41] know
[54:46] come or was it because you wanted
[54:52] to
[54:54] right see if we didn't come on any other
[54:57] basis than we wanted to tonight we were
[54:59] just stayed at home amen right cuz you
[55:02] know what you stayed at home you
[55:04] wouldn't hear what I'm going to
[55:08] say you and be
[55:13] responsible now we were talking my wife
[55:16] was on somebody today and was was
[55:18] talking about
[55:20] it and never was a time in our married
[55:23] life from the time we became I become a
[55:26] Christian in 58 there was never a day a
[55:30] choice a time was ever said are we going
[55:33] to
[55:38] church never
[55:42] right come when you're
[55:48] sick in the hospital with my back
[55:53] Twisted the only time went up to that
[55:56] time we' had like a Friday night
[55:57] Saturday night Sunday night service and
[56:00] I forgot who was preaching but anyhow
[56:02] brother M had Friday night Saturday
[56:04] night Sunday services or
[56:07] somebody and the doctor told me he said
[56:09] I'll dismiss you from the hospital if
[56:11] you go home and go to
[56:14] bed I said you get me out of here I'm
[56:16] going home and go to
[56:19] church he said well you need to go home
[56:21] and go to
[56:25] bed I went home got a nice pack heat
[56:28] pack or one of the two I think was a
[56:29] heat pack I came to church and hooked it
[56:32] up and sat
[56:34] here why cuz I wanted
[56:38] to and you know what God looked down and
[56:41] we talk about those cherim simes
[56:45] Etc you said well it don't I don't well
[56:47] it does have a lot to do with our
[56:50] life but you know what God reached down
[56:53] and touched me and delivered me from
[56:54] that back trouble
[56:57] I've never had another case like
[57:03] that why because I wanted to come to
[57:10] church but how many of you find excuses
[57:14] for not coming right oh that brother
[57:16] they picking on
[57:18] me are you guilty
[57:22] right okay
[57:25] amen if you're guilty I'm not picking on
[57:28] you I'm talking about
[57:31] you
[57:33] am okay how much blunter can I be but
[57:38] you see we make our excuses well don't
[57:40] you think before the world that God knew
[57:42] those
[57:47] excuses now do you think he's going to
[57:49] give a holy ghost to
[57:51] somebody that he
[57:55] knows
[57:57] they won't have the right desire
[58:00] right and you got a messed up idea
[58:03] somewhere there if you think
[58:04] that I'll be glad to find you those
[58:07] quotes cuz I looking at one the other
[58:10] day he gives the Holy Ghost to those
[58:12] that desire him according to the
[58:14] scripture
[58:20] right but what about for
[58:22] knowledge see you want some kind of a
[58:25] predetermined because called
[58:26] predetermined is the end of the
[58:29] journey so you want to live like the
[58:32] devil and then die like Paul as we used
[58:34] to call it the
[58:39] Baptist so you want to live like you
[58:41] want to and do what you want to until it
[58:43] comes time and then one of these days
[58:45] we'll slip through some way
[58:48] and we'll just make it because we're
[58:51] predestinated just
[58:53] remember he predestines according to
[58:56] your Desir
[58:59] right
[59:01] right anybody that goes to hell is not
[59:04] going to hell because God wanted them
[59:06] to right they're going to hell because
[59:08] they wanted to now you know that we're
[59:11] not talking about that everybody wants
[59:14] to go jump off in the Lake of Fire cuz
[59:15] we done found out it ain't a lake of
[59:18] fire but you don't do that with me see I
[59:21] don't play with you when I get this way
[59:23] I talk
[59:25] serious
[59:28] nobody wants to go to hell
[59:30] right you got to get over Calvary to get
[59:33] there you got to give over get over an
[59:36] outstretched arms of our Lord and savior
[59:38] to get to to to get to go to
[59:42] hell but what about
[59:46] it if he knows every thought that we
[59:49] have wouldn't he know those thought
[59:51] before the world right see God don't do
[59:54] things in a halfhazard way so he didn't
[59:56] give Judas the Holy
[1:00:00] Ghost and don't get tied up in the
[1:00:02] anointings and things like that we're
[1:00:04] talking about the New Birth
[1:00:06] amen he didn't give it to him
[1:00:13] right because he
[1:00:18] knew he loved
[1:00:20] Jacob and he hated Esau it says right
[1:00:25] why
[1:00:27] because he
[1:00:32] knew you see if you have the new birth
[1:00:38] today then God knew you wanted it more
[1:00:41] than right just like
[1:00:44] Jacob right you do anything to get it
[1:00:47] right right right he wanted that birth
[1:00:51] right that birth right's the type of the
[1:00:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:56] that's
[1:00:58] right I've talked to a lot of you and
[1:01:00] you've said to me Brother D I don't
[1:01:02] really know whether I'm born again or
[1:01:03] not if you know what's the
[1:01:06] problem he's still working on your
[1:01:08] desires right you're not Desiring
[1:01:11] correctly right see then you say that
[1:01:13] people say well you mean what no no just
[1:01:15] like I said nobody wants to go to hell
[1:01:17] now nobody don't want to miss
[1:01:21] heaven
[1:01:23] right everybody wants to go to heaven it
[1:01:26] don't matter if he's happy hunting
[1:01:27] ground with the old Indian or who it is
[1:01:29] or what he's talking about everybody
[1:01:31] wants something after this world right
[1:01:33] right so now don't misunderstand
[1:01:38] them but see four knowledge that's what
[1:01:40] I got to thinking about I thought well
[1:01:42] why don't we want full
[1:01:45] knowledge why don't we want to just
[1:01:49] accept the Bible and the prophet's
[1:01:52] message that says for
[1:01:54] knowledge
[1:01:57] cuz if he didn't predestinate according
[1:01:58] to the desires right and if he would
[1:02:02] have predestinated according to the
[1:02:03] desires now listen to what I'm getting
[1:02:05] to is if he'd predestinated according to
[1:02:07] his desires you know what he'd have
[1:02:11] done somebody tell me what he would have
[1:02:14] done if he predestinate according to his
[1:02:16] desire he'd have saved everybody
[1:02:18] wouldn't
[1:02:21] he right right he saved everybody right
[1:02:29] but he don't predestinate according to
[1:02:31] the
[1:02:32] desires so back before the world he
[1:02:34] could look down through time and see who
[1:02:37] would be saved and who wouldn't then
[1:02:39] it's my fault and your fault why didn't
[1:02:41] I get to Holy Ghost when I was 11 years
[1:02:43] old in that Baptist Church when God
[1:02:45] appeared to me in that
[1:02:52] church I had nobody to tell me about it
[1:02:56] right I had nobody that could help
[1:03:06] me you said well now you mean God will
[1:03:10] will do things well according to brother
[1:03:13] random there was a pope one time that
[1:03:16] the Holy Ghost tried to come on him you
[1:03:18] remember that need that quote be glad to
[1:03:21] find
[1:03:22] it said the Holy Ghost tried to come on
[1:03:25] that pop
[1:03:26] yeah and he rejected
[1:03:29] it that's a direct quote now so if you
[1:03:31] needed out service let me know we'll go
[1:03:33] in office and run it
[1:03:36] up but you know what that Pope turned
[1:03:38] around and
[1:03:40] done he wrote a
[1:03:44] decree that it was better to make people
[1:03:47] serve God by
[1:03:50] force than it was to let them go without
[1:03:54] it so he wrote to decree to kill the
[1:03:57] people to make them worship
[1:04:02] God that's how far he went because the
[1:04:04] Holy Ghost tried to come on
[1:04:06] him
[1:04:08] now is is our Prophet just talking up
[1:04:14] hazly is the Bible just something that
[1:04:17] we can make it fit anywhere we want it
[1:04:19] to
[1:04:20] fit me ask you a question I thought
[1:04:23] about something the other day I
[1:04:26] mentioned it to brother dick tonight one
[1:04:27] of these days I might preach on
[1:04:30] it you know brother random was out dire
[1:04:33] about marriage and divorce and the Lord
[1:04:36] told him to go out there on that
[1:04:38] mountain
[1:04:41] and he said he come down and told me to
[1:04:44] go tell the
[1:04:49] people to go on as they
[1:04:52] are is that right amen can you say Amen
[1:04:56] to that that he done
[1:04:59] that well you know when he come back and
[1:05:02] preached
[1:05:04] it why didn't he tell all about what God
[1:05:07] told him out
[1:05:11] there so well he did he told him to tell
[1:05:14] them what did he say
[1:05:18] yeah what was the quote the prophet made
[1:05:21] that we're quick to
[1:05:24] quote because of Supernatural Revelation
[1:05:27] because of the opening of The Seven
[1:05:29] Seals I say unto
[1:05:32] thee
[1:05:36] y was God speaking to him out there on
[1:05:39] the
[1:05:40] mountain or had he already spoke it to
[1:05:43] him in the marriage and divorce but he
[1:05:45] didn't know it about it in the seals you
[1:05:48] know cuz he says it in questions and
[1:05:51] answers after the seal he said if you're
[1:05:54] spiritual you'll catch something
[1:06:00] he didn't come to Mar that and
[1:06:03] say the Lord told me to say this this is
[1:06:06] what I'm going to say he said because of
[1:06:08] a supernatural
[1:06:10] Revelation he put it right back into the
[1:06:14] word right cuz he couldn't be contrary
[1:06:17] to the word right I saw that I
[1:06:24] rejoiced
[1:06:26] cuz that Prophet put it in the word
[1:06:29] right you said well I believed it was in
[1:06:31] the word right I do too but did you know
[1:06:32] what's in there word like
[1:06:36] that see Church there's a lot in this
[1:06:39] that we need to know a lot about right
[1:06:42] but when we take our own ideas instead
[1:06:45] of waiting on God we wind up like any
[1:06:48] other denomination or organization right
[1:06:51] and we are no different
[1:06:54] then why would we not want it by for
[1:06:58] knowledge
[1:07:02] right can I drill that heart into our
[1:07:07] minds you know by four knowledge God
[1:07:09] knows that we'll get our little feelings
[1:07:13] hurt we'll get upset with brother and
[1:07:18] sister we'll get upset with a pastor we
[1:07:20] get upset with this right you think God
[1:07:23] don't know that sure
[1:07:26] and then your Prophet would turn around
[1:07:28] and say that even God would sometimes
[1:07:31] make your brother and sister say
[1:07:33] something to you to try you
[1:07:39] right what about
[1:07:43] it do you really want it by for
[1:07:51] knowledge but brother Dale you're
[1:07:53] getting it you you putting it to where
[1:07:54] salvation know what we do or don't do I
[1:07:57] didn't say that see you just
[1:08:00] misinterpreted something you deal with
[1:08:03] God about
[1:08:06] that I just put it in the
[1:08:11] Bible because your Prophet said that it
[1:08:14] was for knowledge that God predestinated
[1:08:17] by
[1:08:18] right not his
[1:08:21] desires so it be according to your
[1:08:24] desires
[1:08:26] why is it that some people when they
[1:08:28] come into this message they just it's
[1:08:31] just wonderful but to some it becomes a
[1:08:34] hum
[1:08:35] drum right you know halfhazard thing
[1:08:40] well I'm in the message of course I
[1:08:43] don't go to church too
[1:08:44] often but I believe the prophet every
[1:08:48] word he
[1:08:52] says he said forsake not dissembling so
[1:08:55] he but brother Dale you don't understand
[1:08:57] my
[1:09:01] problems I sat and cried at my wife
[1:09:04] because of her back and neck and knees
[1:09:07] killing her so much and see her still
[1:09:09] struggle
[1:09:10] right and cry and I
[1:09:13] would to see her get in the car and come
[1:09:15] on to
[1:09:17] church knowing how bad she's
[1:09:21] hurting I see some of you sneeze and you
[1:09:23] can't get here
[1:09:26] I thought church is where we're supposed
[1:09:27] to go to when we sick right I didn't I
[1:09:30] don't understand
[1:09:32] that Hey listen let me put it two
[1:09:37] ways if you got a
[1:09:40] disease that other people could catch
[1:09:43] don't worry about coming to church with
[1:09:45] it we're not going to get it from you
[1:09:50] right right see that's what people
[1:09:54] thinks you got something that's bad you
[1:09:56] not go to church where did brother
[1:09:57] brandom ever turn anybody
[1:10:02] away that had a disease or
[1:10:07] anything see you're scared of diseases
[1:10:09] that's why you get
[1:10:12] them that's
[1:10:16] right you can't get a spirit that you
[1:10:18] don't want I've tried to explain that
[1:10:20] and got in trouble about it had people
[1:10:23] different with
[1:10:24] me that's all
[1:10:28] right you're not going to get a spirit
[1:10:31] that you don't
[1:10:33] want
[1:10:36] right you say well brother Dale don't
[1:10:38] you well sure we have the oil we know
[1:10:41] what that means
[1:10:43] right but you mean I'm going to be
[1:10:45] outside somewhere and somebody's going
[1:10:47] to come up and I'm
[1:10:48] sick I I can't pray for you now cuz
[1:10:51] don't have no
[1:10:53] oil are you going to do it brother Mo
[1:10:55] said have man done one time said he was
[1:10:57] kind of they was praying for him and I'm
[1:10:58] just telling it like he said it he said
[1:11:01] the guy was kind of
[1:11:02] nasty and he said there all laying their
[1:11:04] hands on to pray and said he happened to
[1:11:06] look over the corner of his eye and said
[1:11:08] this man had one finger sticking up on
[1:11:10] that guy's head so I guess he figured he
[1:11:13] could trust one
[1:11:14] finger he wasn't going to lay his
[1:11:21] hands see all of that's according to our
[1:11:23] forn knowledge right
[1:11:29] the four knowledge is exactly what it is
[1:11:32] knowledge of an of a situation or
[1:11:36] existence before
[1:11:43] right or
[1:11:46] knowledge what about it why is it we
[1:11:48] don't want
[1:11:52] it brother around said on a message
[1:11:54] positioning Christ 1960 these are still
[1:11:57] last
[1:12:00] Sundays by his infant every how you
[1:12:02] would say it being infinite is the word
[1:12:06] he looked down through the stream of
[1:12:08] time and saw every
[1:12:10] man that would be
[1:12:12] saved
[1:12:16] right he saw
[1:12:18] their whole
[1:12:21] life do we're not pulling nothing over
[1:12:24] on God it's number 14 on your notes if
[1:12:26] you want to read
[1:12:30] it but why do we don't want for
[1:12:35] knowledge because it shows what we
[1:12:39] are it shows why we think like we think
[1:12:43] right because it shows that we do think
[1:12:45] that way
[1:12:53] right you think God doesn't
[1:12:57] know I was looking at one today where
[1:12:59] brother R was talking about you've heard
[1:13:00] of it where there's a man said something
[1:13:03] you know about his family even and this
[1:13:06] brother told him said ain't you going to
[1:13:07] say something about that he said
[1:13:09] no he said that was a predestinated
[1:13:16] trial that would be put before me to see
[1:13:20] what I
[1:13:24] do a predestinated he it trial right you
[1:13:30] know the Bible said all things work
[1:13:34] what together for
[1:13:36] who the
[1:13:39] called according to his
[1:13:44] purpose so it's not up for everybody
[1:13:46] right that's
[1:13:49] right everything don't work together for
[1:13:51] everybody does it it only works together
[1:13:54] for the
[1:13:57] called because it's there for a purpose
[1:13:59] to bring us through a childhood
[1:14:01] development of growth development
[1:14:06] of but brother Dale I'm like I said a
[1:14:09] moment ago I still feel that thing
[1:14:14] dangling we want to be careful about
[1:14:16] praying for people
[1:14:18] why right
[1:14:24] why why should we be careful
[1:14:30] right you mean you're afraid of the
[1:14:32] demon is in the
[1:14:34] person you're afraid of the disease is
[1:14:36] in the person well you know if you're
[1:14:37] afraid of then you can get it if you're
[1:14:40] not afraid of you won't get
[1:14:41] it you to watch me you've been around me
[1:14:45] long enough you seen what I do I
[1:14:47] don't sure we got all we use all sure we
[1:14:50] pray right but if it's not that way we
[1:14:53] just pray anyway right
[1:15:00] but see a lot of you wouldn't go in a
[1:15:02] hospital room where there's a disease
[1:15:07] at you know why cuz you're afraid of
[1:15:11] them and God's forn knowledge lets him
[1:15:13] know you're afraid of
[1:15:16] right right but it also lets him know
[1:15:18] that is there some dumb clu like me that
[1:15:21] what am I afraid
[1:15:23] of
[1:15:29] you mean it's going to get me quicker by
[1:15:31] laying hands on somebody than it is
[1:15:32] through the IR that I'm breathing just
[1:15:33] walking through the
[1:15:37] life see we're afraid of forn knowledge
[1:15:41] cuz for knowledge let shows what we
[1:15:45] are God by for knowledge knew that you
[1:15:49] and I wouldn't be able we were talking
[1:15:50] about it down while
[1:15:52] ago 40 years God is been waiting on you
[1:15:55] and
[1:16:00] I but for knowledge he knows somebody
[1:16:03] will come to it right and he knew it
[1:16:06] take us 40 years and I'm glad of that
[1:16:08] that's right but he knew it you know cuz
[1:16:11] like I've always told
[1:16:14] you I don't have no
[1:16:17] secrets I wouldn't care for my wife
[1:16:20] thinking in any thought or I wouldn't
[1:16:21] care for any of you thinking any thought
[1:16:23] I would ever ever have about you in the
[1:16:26] wrong way as long as you would know the
[1:16:28] end thought before I'm through with the
[1:16:34] conversation but I might be upset and
[1:16:36] say something wrong you don't think
[1:16:38] something
[1:16:39] wrong but at the end of the day I tell
[1:16:41] my wife I love her and that's I'm not
[1:16:44] going to lie I'm like brother Tom fush
[1:16:46] on one thing brother Tom tells you he
[1:16:48] loves you you can Bank on that you know
[1:16:49] you can go down to the bank you can do
[1:16:51] what you want do with it cuz he say I
[1:16:53] ain't going to tell you if I don't
[1:17:00] me but by for
[1:17:05] knowledge God knew everybody would be
[1:17:07] here tonight this
[1:17:08] year sure
[1:17:11] amen
[1:17:13] right and he knew what You' think about
[1:17:15] what I'm talking
[1:17:17] about that's why you got to talk to him
[1:17:19] about it like the old saying goes You
[1:17:22] Know a Man lust in his heart is not a
[1:17:26] divorce you know grounds for a divorce
[1:17:28] cuz you can't prove it against
[1:17:31] him right CU that's within
[1:17:36] yourself but then he goes and displays
[1:17:38] it it's grounds for a divorce you
[1:17:42] right well so is it with your thinking
[1:17:47] right your thinking is your
[1:17:52] thinking but remember your respon
[1:17:54] responsible for what you
[1:17:59] think I remember something happened
[1:18:01] years ago here at the church and there
[1:18:03] was a certain brother and all I just say
[1:18:05] it a few words certain man came through
[1:18:08] here and it was snowing after the
[1:18:11] service was over with I said give the
[1:18:14] brother some money and I said here's you
[1:18:17] enough money for the preaching and
[1:18:20] here's your two nights in the motail you
[1:18:22] go right out there and you go right up
[1:18:24] through that way you go to Gams when
[1:18:25] they some good
[1:18:26] Motel couple of Brothers
[1:18:29] here they said brother Dale you ain't
[1:18:31] going to let him go out like that are
[1:18:36] you I said Brothers y'all don't
[1:18:42] understand said when he leaves I'll
[1:18:45] explain and when he left I explained
[1:18:49] it you know what the problem was that
[1:18:51] man had been in the brother's home for
[1:18:54] 30
[1:18:57] days and I don't believe neither one of
[1:18:59] them brothers wanted that man to go his
[1:19:01] family to go home with them 30 days not
[1:19:04] that you wouldn't want them to go spend
[1:19:05] the night not you wouldn't want to take
[1:19:06] them help them you know no no but you
[1:19:08] wouldn't want them 30 days so he was
[1:19:10] going to get my home 30 days cuz the
[1:19:11] brother called me and told me he said I
[1:19:13] got this brother been over here 30 days
[1:19:14] in my home I said send him
[1:19:19] over you said Brother D yeah but God
[1:19:22] knows I made it my mind that I was going
[1:19:24] to send him somewhere else cuz I was
[1:19:27] going to help that brother
[1:19:29] out so the end of the thing is to know
[1:19:32] that I was trying to help the brother
[1:19:35] the rest of it sound pretty bad didn't
[1:19:39] it see our four knowledge is what we're
[1:19:41] afraid
[1:19:43] of instead of facing it like it
[1:19:50] is if you're not here tonight because
[1:19:52] you wanted to be there's something wrong
[1:19:54] with you
[1:19:59] right then God sees that and says well I
[1:20:01] see that I see a group of people and we
[1:20:04] do we have the best attendance of any
[1:20:06] church that I know of Wednesday nights
[1:20:10] especially you know average attendance
[1:20:13] you know what I'm talking about right
[1:20:15] per many people we got per what
[1:20:19] comes and see we come to
[1:20:22] hear we sure don't come to look we come
[1:20:25] to
[1:20:28] hear well then you ought to come to hear
[1:20:30] and you ought to listen to what I'm
[1:20:31] saying tonight and say well brother D
[1:20:32] was talking to
[1:20:34] me but instead of that she'll say
[1:20:36] brother they was talking about me no I'm
[1:20:38] not talking about
[1:20:42] you anybody out there on the internet
[1:20:44] anybody else yours these I'm talking to
[1:20:48] you don't even talking about
[1:20:51] you see we're afraid of for knowledge
[1:20:54] because forn knowledge brings in our
[1:20:59] lives and our reasons for doing what we
[1:21:04] do
[1:21:07] right you know God predestines according
[1:21:10] to that that's right okay let's keep on
[1:21:13] going that's
[1:21:16] right brother brand on number 15 on your
[1:21:18] notes Jehovah gyen part
[1:21:22] 262 that He sent Jesus to catch those
[1:21:24] who he
[1:21:29] foresaw I want to get just a little bit
[1:21:31] of of something here in a minute even if
[1:21:33] I ain't going to get all of it
[1:21:36] but so then He sent Jesus to catch those
[1:21:40] who he
[1:21:44] fora and there's not going to be one get
[1:21:47] saved that wasn't meant to be saved
[1:21:49] right amen there's not going to be one
[1:21:53] lost that God didn't know they'd be lost
[1:21:59] right the Baptist had a Doctrine at one
[1:22:04] time and they wouldn't have a
[1:22:09] Revival a lot of you never studied it
[1:22:11] even if you come to a Baptist you
[1:22:13] wouldn't
[1:22:14] even they wouldn't have a Revival in
[1:22:16] their Church brother brandom explains
[1:22:19] this you know why they wouldn't have a
[1:22:21] Revival in their
[1:22:23] Church afraid somebody Sav CA they
[1:22:26] afraid somebody to get saved it wasn't
[1:22:28] meant to
[1:22:29] be now boy that's good
[1:22:33] a so we just won't have a
[1:22:38] Revival then out way why no here's me I
[1:22:42] know I get mean here's me why didn't the
[1:22:44] preacher shut up go home and sit down
[1:22:46] and not preach now of course you know
[1:22:51] why the money end of the deal right
[1:22:56] y why didn't they just say well we ain't
[1:22:58] going to preach no more cuz it way then
[1:23:01] God can save who he wants
[1:23:03] to no that's making a living now you're
[1:23:07] talking about my living now brother
[1:23:09] Dale yeah we'll all give an
[1:23:16] account look what he says on the message
[1:23:19] Jehovah Gyra that was Jehovah Gyra part
[1:23:21] two this is Jehovah Gyra
[1:23:23] 58227
[1:23:25] he said his forn
[1:23:27] knowledge allows him to
[1:23:34] predestinate and you read all of those
[1:23:37] because all of them's got some things in
[1:23:38] it that's real
[1:23:41] good about how did he look down through
[1:23:45] time how did he
[1:23:47] saw how he
[1:23:50] knew but just
[1:23:53] remember he never never saved
[1:23:59] you that didn't want to be
[1:24:02] saved he will not override your freem
[1:24:04] moral
[1:24:06] agency
[1:24:09] right he won't do
[1:24:12] it he knew you'd want
[1:24:14] it or else he didn't give it to you so
[1:24:18] that's why a lot of people say well I
[1:24:19] don't know whether I'm saved or not well
[1:24:20] that's you know I get I get in trouble
[1:24:23] by saying it
[1:24:24] I told one brother one time I said told
[1:24:27] about him I said according to your
[1:24:29] desires brother well he just left out of
[1:24:32] here he said brother Dale said I
[1:24:34] wouldn't even sa I didn't say that I
[1:24:37] said according to the way he was looking
[1:24:38] he
[1:24:40] wasn't
[1:24:42] you cuz Wes do it he wouldn't
[1:24:47] right but you
[1:24:49] see brother Brandon when he got down to
[1:24:51] questions and answers number 17 on your
[1:24:54] notes
[1:24:55] 1959 conduct order and
[1:24:58] Doctrine he said predestination is only
[1:25:01] the forn knowledge of
[1:25:03] God right see now you say but but
[1:25:06] Brother D what about all this other
[1:25:08] about the seed and about this and all
[1:25:14] right let's take one
[1:25:19] quote only the seed come predestinated
[1:25:22] eternally right from God Amen not the
[1:25:26] person that's right now that's what your
[1:25:29] Prophet said
[1:25:31] amen but it wasn't a person that's
[1:25:33] predestinated eternally it was the seed
[1:25:36] our word right right so we got a long
[1:25:39] ways to go
[1:25:41] right but
[1:25:45] listen on the message he arose Jesus
[1:25:47] arose 1956 number 18 in he note he could
[1:25:51] see all things the way it would happen
[1:25:58] happen like I said there's a lot more on
[1:26:00] I read
[1:26:04] it first seal par page
[1:26:08] 12563
[1:26:09] 318 by his for knowledge he saw
[1:26:18] them mark of the beast 61-1 17 by his
[1:26:22] four knowledge
[1:26:26] he Christ a mystery of God revealed
[1:26:29] brother Brown said predestination there
[1:26:30] is the mystery
[1:26:34] yep there's the
[1:26:38] mystery Paul called it the mystery of
[1:26:40] his will I'm not going to get back to
[1:26:42] those scriptures cuz there's a lot in
[1:26:43] this read I keep reading that scripture
[1:26:45] but I would invite you to just study
[1:26:48] Ephesians
[1:26:51] 1 over and over and and
[1:27:02] over questions answered Hebrews part 3
[1:27:08] 57106 by for knowledge he could tell who
[1:27:10] would be saved and who wouldn't be
[1:27:17] saved that's why Jacob have I loved and
[1:27:20] Esau have I
[1:27:22] hated before before they ever done
[1:27:26] anything now how can God be just to do
[1:27:30] that but what
[1:27:33] terminologies would you be able to put
[1:27:35] it on see that's where people don't
[1:27:37] realize what they're
[1:27:39] doing if you take predestination as the
[1:27:42] people of the message the biggest
[1:27:43] percentage take is on the basis of
[1:27:46] predetermining and that we are this seed
[1:27:48] we're this
[1:27:53] seed
[1:27:54] and I believe what the prophet had to
[1:27:57] say but remember if you don't approach
[1:28:00] it by for
[1:28:02] knowledge right you got God Desiring to
[1:28:05] save Jacob because he was some kind of a
[1:28:08] seed and hating Esa because he was a nun
[1:28:14] seed and what kind of a Doctrine have
[1:28:16] you
[1:28:21] got see what I mean see people don't
[1:28:24] think about what they're
[1:28:27] approaching brother I just believe what
[1:28:29] he said I just found 200 quotes about
[1:28:32] how that we was a seed and how we was at
[1:28:37] aen and there every one
[1:28:39] right you know unless it's a slip of the
[1:28:42] tongue brother around ma something he
[1:28:43] said in a paragraph or
[1:28:46] something but without putting them in
[1:28:48] the right category where are
[1:28:53] they
[1:28:55] did you catch what I just said Jacob
[1:28:58] have I love and Esau I hated I people
[1:29:01] say I love he love Jacob cuz Jacob was a
[1:29:03] seed well he didn't he didn't give Esau
[1:29:06] a
[1:29:07] chance so Esau can go to judgment with
[1:29:10] God and say you never gave me an
[1:29:12] opportunity
[1:29:15] right so you don't realize what you're
[1:29:17] doing with the word of
[1:29:19] God that won't change nobody that just
[1:29:21] clicks off the tapes and things that
[1:29:23] just
[1:29:24] they're not going to
[1:29:28] listen they click on to find out what
[1:29:30] you're talking about then when you say
[1:29:32] something I don't agree that's click off
[1:29:34] you
[1:29:36] know I've always been honest enough to
[1:29:39] be one thing if I click on I'm going to
[1:29:41] listen to what the whole ceremony
[1:29:44] is right and I'm not going to try to
[1:29:46] listen to it as a I've already got this
[1:29:49] figured out but I'll try to find out
[1:29:50] what he's talking about if you do that
[1:29:53] you cut the tape off and and go pray cuz
[1:29:54] you're in the wrong shape and remember
[1:29:57] full knowledge allowed God to know you
[1:29:59] would think
[1:30:04] that that's why we don't want full
[1:30:10] knowledge you know that God called
[1:30:12] Abraham by
[1:30:15] predestination by for
[1:30:18] knowledge look at number 24 if you
[1:30:20] notes which is paragraph 318 Hebrews
[1:30:23] chapter 7 part 1 fature 7
[1:30:32] 9:15 he
[1:30:34] predestinated
[1:30:37] Abraham by for
[1:30:45] knowledge no now brother there you just
[1:30:47] don't understand you just you're so
[1:30:50] carnal and I agree with you you you just
[1:30:54] don't know what you're talking about I
[1:30:57] grie you there but what do the word
[1:31:11] say but Brother D we're supposed to know
[1:31:14] something about having this seed in
[1:31:22] US I just covered it there a moment ago
[1:31:25] did you catch on to
[1:31:27] that everybody in the
[1:31:30] world is born with a desire to serve
[1:31:37] God we put ourselves in the pawn
[1:31:40] shop amen by accepting Satan's
[1:31:46] lie you don't believe
[1:31:48] that go over to the life message what we
[1:31:52] just heard Sunday and read there where
[1:31:55] the Prophet said about the two
[1:32:01] natures and see what he had to say about
[1:32:08] it if you put eternal life in your soul
[1:32:11] and it lost that's right you got a lost
[1:32:14] eternal life you got a problem
[1:32:19] right you see but people don't want to
[1:32:21] hear it like that they want to hear some
[1:32:23] kind of a glorious something to build us
[1:32:25] up and make us do things and let me just
[1:32:27] get this last part
[1:32:30] okay you'll have to go to the
[1:32:33] lice the back of all that we just gave
[1:32:35] you today we'll start on number
[1:32:39] 17 then we'll get back to this Sunday
[1:32:42] and bring the rest of it cuz you think
[1:32:44] on it from now to Sunday on one
[1:32:47] thing
[1:32:52] predestination looks to full
[1:32:55] knowledge
[1:32:57] back to full
[1:32:59] knowledge you got the quotes reading
[1:33:02] till Sunday but bring them back we sa me
[1:33:04] having to redo
[1:33:06] it predestination looks
[1:33:09] back to for
[1:33:12] knowledge that's a great
[1:33:17] statement for knowledge looks on to
[1:33:20] Destiny so it's all tied to for
[1:33:22] knowledge so let's just get a little bit
[1:33:24] right
[1:33:26] here let's talk a little bit like I said
[1:33:29] about why are you afraid of for
[1:33:34] knowledge see God looked down through
[1:33:36] time and knew knew every one of us and
[1:33:38] every thought we'd ever
[1:33:40] have every desire we'd ever
[1:33:45] have every word we'd ever say every
[1:33:49] thought we'd ever have right or
[1:33:52] wrong
[1:33:54] and if it's not under the
[1:34:00] blood we'll have to give an account one
[1:34:06] day that's the Judgment you know of the
[1:34:08] Deeds Done in the body whether good or
[1:34:10] bad may not be a decision of eternal
[1:34:14] life without to give an
[1:34:18] account but why would I entertain a
[1:34:22] thought
[1:34:26] you mean after all of these years I've
[1:34:28] preached to you that somebody could come
[1:34:30] up and tell you now brother Dale is uh
[1:34:33] he's just this that or the
[1:34:35] other and you'd listen to that and
[1:34:40] entertain Brother D don't really love
[1:34:42] y'all he
[1:34:44] just You' listen to
[1:34:48] that I appreciate a brother called me
[1:34:50] one time on the telephone you know what
[1:34:52] he said he said brother Dale I some
[1:34:53] brother's up here telling something and
[1:34:55] they said that you said
[1:34:57] it he said I heard two brothers talking
[1:35:00] said
[1:35:01] they they said you said so and so and he
[1:35:03] said I told them I know brother Dale and
[1:35:06] he didn't say
[1:35:08] it I said thank you
[1:35:12] brother that meant a lot to
[1:35:16] me he had the confidence enough into me
[1:35:19] know that I didn't say it the way they
[1:35:20] was talking about it I appreciate it
[1:35:26] all right what God
[1:35:29] fornew or
[1:35:33] fora those who heer knew he did
[1:35:38] predestinate now I will get back to this
[1:35:40] later but I will make this point
[1:35:43] remember the book of Ephesians is not
[1:35:45] written to the
[1:35:48] world it is written only to Christians
[1:35:52] right it is not written to the world
[1:35:56] right so those he
[1:35:59] forne he doesn't have to have a tape
[1:36:03] player to bring it to judgment when a
[1:36:06] sinner walks up there you've heard your
[1:36:09] Prophet make the expression he said that
[1:36:12] he a sinner will go by with his head
[1:36:15] bowed at the Judgment he will not have
[1:36:19] to tell him that he was
[1:36:22] wrong he said but the ones he'll have to
[1:36:24] bring to judgment is those who think
[1:36:27] they are right have not I cast out
[1:36:30] Devils have not I done all these things
[1:36:34] he said depart from me I never knew
[1:36:37] you you wasn't in the for knowledge of
[1:36:40] God on because the forn knowledge of God
[1:36:43] listen to what I'm saying and make it
[1:36:45] right
[1:36:46] now the for knowledge of God doesn't
[1:36:48] give a hoot about the rest of the
[1:36:52] world
[1:36:54] because he knows what they'll
[1:36:59] do you took it the wrong way when I
[1:37:02] first said it didn't
[1:37:04] he you thought I saiding something wrong
[1:37:06] where it said he didn't give a hoop let
[1:37:08] me quote scripture for
[1:37:10] you brute Beast made to be
[1:37:14] destroyed one purpose
[1:37:18] H2O to
[1:37:22] explode y
[1:37:24] now if you don't do that correctly what
[1:37:25] have you
[1:37:28] got if you didn't give that person a
[1:37:31] choice but full knowledge what have you
[1:37:32] got you got a God just making people and
[1:37:35] killing them and then laughing about
[1:37:40] it the predestination of God is dealing
[1:37:43] with the bride of Jesus
[1:37:45] Christ right the true
[1:37:50] church those are the ones he fornew
[1:37:53] right
[1:37:54] the others he just knows all about
[1:37:56] it right but he knows if he kept Adolf
[1:37:59] Hitler and I'm not throwing off on him
[1:38:01] just using them or anybody Samuel Dale
[1:38:04] don't
[1:38:05] matter God knew that if he left me here
[1:38:08] for 100 million
[1:38:11] years my choice would be the same that's
[1:38:17] right and yet a loving
[1:38:21] God that would come down every day and
[1:38:24] deal with you and
[1:38:25] me that's what I don't
[1:38:30] understand a loving God brother R said
[1:38:33] he didn't step in heaven when man sin
[1:38:35] said he came down to
[1:38:36] earth a loving God that will stand there
[1:38:40] and begging you not to go to
[1:38:43] hell do everything he can to show you
[1:38:46] signs and wonders and help you
[1:38:49] financially and and all kind of
[1:38:52] things
[1:38:58] because he wants you to make the right
[1:39:00] choice don't you think God knows how to
[1:39:02] raise
[1:39:06] children he wants us to make a right
[1:39:09] choice
[1:39:13] right this is making way 1956
[1:39:19] 304 so forn knowledge looks back and
[1:39:23] says that he foresaw
[1:39:28] this sensible is
[1:39:31] it and knows that's the reason he could
[1:39:34] tell what the end was from the beginning
[1:39:38] therefore knowing that all these
[1:39:40] marvelous days listen that we're living
[1:39:43] in now and to stand and witness and see
[1:39:46] the things that we SE now God had to
[1:39:50] make a preparation for it right
[1:39:57] what about
[1:40:00] it God made a preparation for you to be
[1:40:03] here tonight what you going to do with
[1:40:05] it I'm going to go away my feelings
[1:40:13] hurt you know brother Dale better than
[1:40:15] that don't
[1:40:18] you if you don't you got a
[1:40:22] problem
[1:40:25] right right cuz you know how I
[1:40:28] am Abraham's seed got one amen 59
[1:40:33] 423 then when God foresaw by his forn
[1:40:38] knowledge how he would redeem the world
[1:40:40] of sin and Corruption he slay Christ
[1:40:44] before the foundation of the world when
[1:40:46] he spoke the word 4,000 years before it
[1:40:49] was
[1:40:52] manifested
[1:40:55] he fornew you and called you in
[1:40:57] Christ all right last let's see 19
[1:41:00] Ephesians parallels
[1:41:03] Joshua what did he
[1:41:06] do that's where I titled the thing you
[1:41:09] know how did he do it said what did he
[1:41:12] do he by four
[1:41:14] knowledge foresaw
[1:41:16] us knowing that he was a
[1:41:19] savior
[1:41:22] self-existence
[1:41:25] now
[1:41:30] listen fora
[1:41:35] us knowing that he was a savior
[1:41:38] self-existing there was no Angels no
[1:41:41] nothing but God just God El Elohim the
[1:41:46] self-existing one nothing but him
[1:41:50] alone but in him was a savior
[1:41:56] well what's he going to save there's
[1:41:59] nothing lost knowing that that he know
[1:42:03] that this great attribute in him would
[1:42:05] project something out y that he could
[1:42:08] say now did he project out are you
[1:42:11] reading that which way you can read it
[1:42:14] this way he projected out he made it go
[1:42:17] out and made Sin appear to where he
[1:42:19] could become a
[1:42:21] savior now is that the way you think
[1:42:23] think that's what's being
[1:42:27] said that would make him condemning us
[1:42:31] for having a
[1:42:32] choice no what is it he would project
[1:42:36] something out yonder that he could
[1:42:40] save in other words he would know all he
[1:42:44] had to do was put us on free moral
[1:42:46] agency and give us a choice right
[1:42:51] amen right
[1:42:53] yeah he knew that's all he had to
[1:42:56] do he couldn't make us wrong and condemn
[1:42:59] us for being wrong he just give us a
[1:43:00] choice but he knew when he give us a
[1:43:02] choice we go wrong then he could display
[1:43:04] himself as a savior right then when he
[1:43:07] did that by for knowledge he looked down
[1:43:10] and he saw everyone that would accept it
[1:43:12] and then by doing so he said to save
[1:43:15] that the only way I can do it will
[1:43:18] become down myself and be made flesh and
[1:43:21] take the sin of the man upon him and die
[1:43:25] for him that I might that I might be the
[1:43:29] one that's worshiped because he is God
[1:43:32] the object of
[1:43:33] worship wonderful God is it last one Be
[1:43:36] not Afraid 1960 look at the
[1:43:40] bottom but when God sets
[1:43:45] it it's forn
[1:43:47] knowledge by for knowledge he
[1:43:51] foresaw everything
[1:43:53] amen by for knowledge he foresaw
[1:43:57] everything then nothing out of
[1:44:00] cater nothing's messed up just for you
[1:44:03] and
[1:44:06] I right we're the ones messed
[1:44:11] up did Brother brandom come and bring us
[1:44:14] something different than what the Bible
[1:44:16] says about
[1:44:20] predestination he told us how it was
[1:44:22] done that's
[1:44:28] right and we'll go back into that and
[1:44:30] follow it down but as I said I wish you
[1:44:33] would read Ephesians 1 over and over and
[1:44:36] over and study
[1:44:39] it a lot in
[1:44:46] there you'll see what choices are
[1:44:50] made I want you to just think about it
[1:44:53] it I'm sorry if I offended you in any
[1:44:55] way tonight what I said I'm
[1:44:58] sorry not for what was said but for
[1:45:01] saying
[1:45:03] it because I don't want to hurt
[1:45:07] anybody but I want the truth and I was
[1:45:09] just sitting there today
[1:45:11] thinking why are we afraid of forn
[1:45:15] knowledge why is it not just a simple
[1:45:19] thing what was the problem in the
[1:45:22] Baptist what was not just why wouldn't
[1:45:23] it just a simple thing to say for
[1:45:28] knowledge but see somebody thought they
[1:45:30] had an
[1:45:34] idea and they made a Doctrine out of and
[1:45:37] they split churches out of it
[1:45:41] Y how many times have we seen that in
[1:45:43] this
[1:45:48] message just remember he predestines
[1:45:51] according to your desires
[1:45:55] what do you
[1:45:58] desire and why do you desire
[1:46:09] it why would you desire something that
[1:46:13] would not be according to God's
[1:46:18] word you know why because we're
[1:46:21] human
[1:46:24] we all have our thoughts in our mind
[1:46:26] don't be playing with me I won't play
[1:46:28] with you okay we all have thoughts in
[1:46:30] our mind and Satan gets in there and
[1:46:32] works on us and does things right cuz
[1:46:34] we're
[1:46:39] human but you know I just want my Lord
[1:46:41] to know one thing when I go to bed at
[1:46:43] night I tell him Lord I love
[1:46:45] you I tell my wife I said I love
[1:46:48] you I tell the kids when they leave the
[1:46:51] house I love you right
[1:46:55] you know that brother Brandon made a
[1:46:56] statement I know you've read it he said
[1:46:58] I'd rather see a love in a church than
[1:47:00] see 10,000 people
[1:47:04] healed now I may be wrong on my numbered
[1:47:06] but I think it's right
[1:47:08] 10,000 I remember when I first read that
[1:47:11] I thought Lord what's a man trying to
[1:47:14] say he'd rather see love than see 10,000
[1:47:17] he goes right on and he explained it he
[1:47:18] said because if love comes in there'll
[1:47:20] be 20,000 or something right
[1:47:25] I would to God that there would be a
[1:47:26] spirit of Love falling among this church
[1:47:28] people cuz there's some here that won't
[1:47:30] even hardly speak to each
[1:47:32] other CU of some little old silly
[1:47:41] something I would to God there'd be a
[1:47:43] spirit of love fall here that would just
[1:47:45] put everybody in love with God you know
[1:47:48] what it to solve marriages you know when
[1:47:50] you got problems in your
[1:47:51] marriage that's right if you got God in
[1:47:54] your marriage you're not going to have
[1:47:55] no problems oh yeah you're going to have
[1:47:56] troubles yeah okay you have
[1:47:58] troubles cuz you're two people and our
[1:48:02] problem is we're too stubborn to give in
[1:48:03] on our
[1:48:06] side I telling my wife the other day
[1:48:08] about something talking to her I said
[1:48:10] you know you got this people over here
[1:48:13] and you got this people over
[1:48:15] here and the way this husband and wife
[1:48:17] acts this husband and wife would love to
[1:48:19] they act that
[1:48:21] way but this husband wife would love to
[1:48:24] theirs act like that
[1:48:27] yeah you
[1:48:30] know but see it's not going to
[1:48:34] work cuz that'd be a lot of
[1:48:37] divorces right and then you'd have a lot
[1:48:40] of garbage skins cuz you'd find out it
[1:48:42] ain't as green over there as you think
[1:48:44] it is you know on the other side you
[1:48:47] know yeah that's
[1:48:51] right mhm
[1:48:53] I was talking to somebody one time you
[1:48:54] know I said well what what's about your
[1:48:57] husband is he is he he don't make a good
[1:49:01] li no he makes
[1:49:03] good what is it he's not at home right
[1:49:06] well he's at home a lot more than I want
[1:49:07] him to be
[1:49:11] maybe and he does all of this and he
[1:49:14] buys you stuff
[1:49:17] yeah I said well what's the problem most
[1:49:20] of the women in the church are like to
[1:49:22] swap with with
[1:49:26] you what you
[1:49:29] say if we don't have a marriage in Jesus
[1:49:32] Christ our marriage is not worth
[1:49:33] anything
[1:49:34] anyway but if it's in Jesus Christ it'll
[1:49:36] all come together that's
[1:49:39] right
[1:49:42] right God is in
[1:49:47] Christ I would to God come on brothers
[1:49:50] that they'd be such a love that's what
[1:49:52] I'm praying
[1:49:53] that's right that would fall in this
[1:49:54] church until we would just love each
[1:49:56] other that husbands and wives would love
[1:49:59] each other and they'd fall in love again
[1:50:02] with each
[1:50:05] other I told you I talk plain I'm just
[1:50:08] as honest as I can be you marry the
[1:50:09] first time you marry from lust by genes
[1:50:12] or what you call them things or hormones
[1:50:15] whatever you call them that's what
[1:50:16] causes marriage you say I fell instantly
[1:50:19] in love with him well you this harmones
[1:50:21] reacted
[1:50:23] no you didn't fall in love cuz you don't
[1:50:25] even know them that's where the trouble
[1:50:27] is people go get married after knowing
[1:50:28] each other two weeks and then what do
[1:50:30] they do and two more weeks they divorced
[1:50:32] right it ain't that
[1:50:35] away that's right but then you learn to
[1:50:38] love
[1:50:41] amen you learn to love after 50
[1:50:47] years you learn to love one another
[1:50:51] amen
[1:50:53] because that's the way it is in
[1:50:56] God God's not looking down watching us
[1:50:59] to see what we're going to do and going
[1:51:01] to zap us because we do something wrong
[1:51:03] you know what cuz he knows by for
[1:51:07] knowledge right he knows by for
[1:51:11] knowledge that you'll make that right is
[1:51:13] that
[1:51:16] true so then it's for knowledge he's not
[1:51:18] looking at you and saying but give me a
[1:51:20] stick I'll beat the daylight out of he's
[1:51:22] looking down he said but look what they
[1:51:26] doing that they down there on their
[1:51:28] knees crying out and
[1:51:30] praying that they're sorry for what
[1:51:32] they've done so Satan just get out from
[1:51:35] here you can't talk no
[1:51:37] more that Buffalo Satan more than
[1:51:39] anything is love in the church let's

[1:56:09] why it would take
[1:56:16] place so what are we then are we afraid

[1:56:59] desire you desire to serve
[1:57:05] him no matter what the world
[1:57:08] says or what takes place going to serve
[1:57:12] you
[1:57:13] why because I'm afraid of going to hell
[1:57:17] no I deserve
[1:57:21] that serve him because to love
[1:57:25] him you love him that
[1:57:28] way do you love him that if he would
[1:57:30] throw you down on the ground and stomp
