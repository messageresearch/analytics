are you when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and children folks you and cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake your reward is great in heaven manner did their fathers sons of the prophets but woe unto you that are rich or you have received your consolation go up to you and all men shall speak well of you for so addition that father due to the false prophets hate you bless bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you to take give to every man that asks me and on him and take it away than this ask them not them

shaken together and running over shall men give unto your bosom for with the same measure that you meet it shall be measured to you again this helpful it's not about his master but everyone that is perfect shall be ss mesh either I'll test now saying to their brother brother let me pull out the mote that is in the eye when the silk behold is not that beingness in that or I the hypocrite guess that first then beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou secret report update mote that is in thy brother's eye free forever tree is known by his own food for a farm and do not gather fixed or a bramble bush last week o son about from the beginning there was he's been trying to separate us or killer or killers so best corner of regulations 1279 chapter 12 seven verse tonight and there was war heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which to see the whole wall he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him so what is he known here so we know there's no way we know there's only two sides the devil side and Ja side so like Joshua said choose your dated state who you shall serve as for me in my house I shall serve the Lord this might be a little off but I'm sorry the devil the devil's getting closer to home yeah pretty for all the people that they had that shooting in Texas today at the church is 26 people got killed I think of sportiness kids and the youngest was 17 months there was old there was one lady that was pregnant so so what are the unbelievers started doing they started mocking the people was when the guy was going on Alex showed everybody they were all praying and democracy very very pretty where's your God now we do that at the same thing to Jesus let's go to mark 15 27 to 32 Mar 15 2015 2 and with him they are cursed by two thieves the one on the right hand and the other on the left hand and the scripture was fulfilled which saved and he was a number of it as transgressors and they they passed by rail on him why I think there he is insane though they destroyed the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself and come down from the cross love also the chief priests not said among themselves with a scribe he saved others himself he cannot say that Christ the King of Israel is sending up from the cross that we may see and believe in me and they they were crucified with him reviled we all have to learn to forgive each other unforgiveness unforgiveness is like the balloon if we try to suppress it in one area you'll pop out in another area of our life at time they start with obvious when someone is harboring unforgiveness mentioned the offender's name and all sorts of negative emotion bubble to the surface but other time and I'm forgiving spirit may not be so apparent because it's been repressed or deny it personally I wonder why he feels critical is distrustful with others realizing these emotions or symptoms of something deeper unforgiveness is like the balloon it would try to suppress it in a one area of our life it will pop up and another one this is no way to live there's certainly not the way the certain not for God intended for us according to Ephesians 4:30 we do to put away all bitterness wrath anger clamor slander malice each of which is evidence I'm forgiving spirit and he brews 1215 we were warned not to let ruin a bitterness spring up costing and upon those around us [Applause] we know God made the mountains the valleys the ocean so we're all different some people get offended real easier if somebody don't shake their hand or you know say hi or what others but but others other people's nothing bothers them you know we got one guy you told me to do something and he kind of rolls it and another the other guy you you talk do something just goes like that and then he says he'll throw his head in the ground said I ain't doing it so we're all different so just think God had made just one person the Venus horrible for example I'm not picking on him it was all brother ways this whole earth was cold by the way Vietnam place it would be a perfect world or a big world but if your neighborhoods ourselves you would get your mail and I hate myself you get your alive Abelson if you get your mail on time because maybe we'll get your grass cut you free hey ho wait a minute no no that'd be a charge for their 3d brain release on that Matthew 18 18 to 21 to 35 all forgiveness I'm gonna read it anyway yeah there's no later than have 18 Matthew 18:21 yeah yeah I just 13 I just did 35 so my gosh um I have any fives also on to you you from your horse forgive not every one his brother their transgressors maybe I'll just mark them off and the message pursue member Lim said he said here not long ago they got some issues each one pull up to himself as the little issues presuming that's what they ought to have done that's what they ought not to have done stick together all of you don't take your issues out like that bring it in here and pray it out if you can't have your issues and still love your brother all right but when you lose respect and fellowship with your whether your issue is killed kill you we'll say at 14 for our lilting backsliding I will love them free for my anger strength away from him Matthew 5:43 48 you revert it has said thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children are your father which is in heaven the hope or he made the Sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust but if you love that we love you what reward have ye but the money and that poker counts the same if you salute your brother only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect matthew limits 61920 for said lay not your treasures at the pond earth and when it where moth and rust do corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up yourself treasures in heaven which neither no moth nor rust do corrupt Bertie's the membrane through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also the light of the body is the eye therefore the eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light better than I the evil their whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light is in thee be darkness not great instrument darkness no man could say to vessels where he will hate the one and love the other also he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve to serve God and Mammon that's benefited my family Matthew 22:30 5:37 man one of them which is Lord ask him a question tempting him the same master which is the Great Commandment in the law Jesus stayed on behind not shalt love thy Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and Great Commandment and the second is like time to unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as ourself by the way that's right matthew 24:6 13 and you have heard of wars and rumors of wars either you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom to eventually famine and pestilence earthquakes in diverse places all these are beginnings of Sorrows driven and I shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another the many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of Managed west cold but neither shall endure to the end the same shall be saved John 13:34 a new commandment I give unto you that you go one of us and notice I had loved you that ye also love one another that's quite a few on that whole Bible still below normal Romans 13:8 over no man anything but to love one another where he that of it another that fulfilled the law 1st Thessalonians 4 9 but it's touching brotherly love you need not get it right unto you for you yourselves have thought of God to love one another first Peter 1:22 seen you yet purify your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit I'm dead I'm forgiven love the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently let everybody feel it here first John 3:23 and this is it this commandment that we should believe on the name of his son Jesus Christ and love one another as he gave us commandment first John four eleven twelve we fell because so loved us we ought to look also love one another no man has seen God at any time we felt one another God dwell in US and his love is perfect in this [Music] second job Johnson and now I beseech you lady not as that though I wrote a new commandment unto thee but that wish we had from the game that we love one another in the message protocol both of em said I can see him again with the big crowds down there as long as money lasted he was a good fellow that's the way the world treats you as long as you've got money got friends but when your money's gone your friends along that's right whether friends an old friend will stick by if you haven't got haven't got a penny Jesus Christ the Son of God I've been to a place where I had another cent he loved me he loved me just as much as that would have a penny or if I had a million dollars he loves me just the same that pure holy unadulterated love comes I'm going along down from his people that's the way we should love one another with God the message the works that I do bear witness of me after all I read all had the love of God steel in my heart and all the gifts there is in the Bible that's right I thought of that here human nice ago my little girl called me and told her she wanted me to come home to her she does me oh my so I said told her I sent her a new dog but she didn't want at all she said I want you daddy not your dome she wants me well that's the way I think about Jesus I love his gifts and things to help its people but I want Jesus the love of God sealed in your heart press the head until all the water the world's press down and you see nothing but the Lord to love him as you love one another you love the Lord if you don't know how to know that you can love the Lord he says so that's right and God can't move into it the works that I do bear witness I mean and remember the children I don't care what church you don't talk or what you have done oh well you've done this or that or they are there how much you put it in the collection place or if you're a deacon preacher or pastor or be a lay member or whatever it is you'll never come into the kingdom of God until the Holy Spirit has Sealy and then to the kingdom but His divine love that the whole Christian world is your brother and sister that's right the world sealed up and God's sealed in well you'd ever want to know that truly with divine Christin little that's right then you know the Holy Spirit is really working through you then that's right and by their fruits you shall know them faith is a substance so Paul said it was impossible for him to do those things without having the giver though I speak with tongues of men and angels they're not charity it prefer to mean nothing Rosi all right no know one another about everything that you do that one another as you know wanna know you love glossy you love each other and you love God or God is love man they watches him love walks in life and perfect love casts out all fear many you can't take him at his world and not feel terrible about it say lord I love you I know you're going to answer because you promised me you would I just know you're going to do is see and it takes away all fear you describe the same yesterday every room and one is is an attribute of God and if we be just children and God wants us to love one another in doing so without God is that right we love his church not the building that people right Jesus quite the same yesterday forever the same message I wasn't on this and I found this in my life my ministry if you you want to serve God serve his people that's how you serve as we love one another without God I love its people I'm doing all that I know not to try to really percent our Lord Jesus Christ and no wait that means divine mercy and power that he has given me to the church in his last day in the healing line listen here's a lovely thing is you're sure one and all you're serving God see the love of God is in every Christian heart and be kind to one another forgiving one another if you don't see the scripture just a life well you believe any home and pray for the other person and just that one you'll find there's no greater evidence a Christian in the world and love expectations and when we love God with all our hearts Souls and minds and we love one another as ourselves our neighbors as ourselves the people and actually feel that you can't put it out you can't make it believe because they'll know it I believe Lincoln said one time you can pull a part of the people for the time but not all of the people all of the time and that's right if you got love in your heart for the people of Illinois you might act different different or anything but still they know they can't feel it it's another dimension as we call it better injects to these people love they know it and they believe it and that's when you can help the person when you believe it and retention my power that's a good thing about all time religion it makes everybody said together and love one another sure does takes all the differences away makes new creatures you'll make that succeed your coat and a pair of overalls but your arms are on one another say brother you getting along that's right sure you'll make a silk dress and call it cold what's a colleague account fundamental material I know glad you don't have open their arms and say sister Lydia that's what it does it sure does just tear down the differences rich or poor barn or food we're all one in Christ Jesus the position I believe in Christ forget your tradition let's come together as God's children and you can't know one another like that then there's something wrong with your experiences I want to save upon emotion and you wonder why all this false false teachings are rising up in these churches people in person anything is the very cause of a the church is hunger and food but you can't get together get yourself together in Christ Jesus and God will give you that real genuine faith in Tison spirits it's just like God heard the car works where they build a big bunch of freight car or a big bunch of passengers car you said I used to work there an egg take it and build a little big coaches and everything and put fargood in and laid mahogany hard on it so beautiful set it out there on a track it was then it was dead as a doornail there are said to hinge and no steam minute you just said that what it is today is some fire in a boiler when this today is some steam when is today in the church - Paul - the hottest point thing there is two balls the sin out of your life don't forgiveness it's part of sin develop out and you can't love one another how are you going to love God well you haven't seen without hides a multitude of sin getting a little with God and you love one another then you love the church you love the college you everything that's godly and you keep away from the things of the world where I think pentecost failed he would disagree a million miles upon theology if he loves the Lord Jesus he's my brother and it's my sister and we've drawn those nine we can't love your brother we have seen how can you love God we can't have never seen Embree little money that goes out got gold when love goes out you got close with it well god is love and you can't never get anywhere with it without divine love as much as you've got one another you I've got about a million laughs ready fellowship with God but this great strain of man longing for fellowship we try to bring people together through their ages many times the educational programs has tried to unite people together by education and standing in this auditorium tonight this leverage school certainly won't speak against education but education is not the appropriate way for fellowship you can't educate people to love one another you think you can but it takes that divine order to do that there's no way to do it through education the church and its condition you can't love nothing that wasn't of your nature love it has to unite with love and husband and wife has to love one another if they ever made the grade family has to love one another you've ever make the great something to be loved you search everywhere find a girl to be your wife that you know your searches planning a husband that you could love you got searches trying to find a soul that he can love so he representing himself there on earth as in gentle dove and a gentle man if that land would want in one minute ever taken on nature snarling wolf the dead dove would took flight immediately ship that gun oh wait a lot of time we filled down or if somebody don't love me or somebody hurt my medicine I'm not beside God it's hugging your your kids or your grandbabies I'm ready to tackle the world from the beginning it wasn't so if your church tradition has taught you contrary to that let's go back to the beginning of where we left it and let's produce here tonight a members of the church at the beginning who had brotherly love one for another they down their lives for one another men and women would love one another such divine love till they go any degree or two the yellow sweet penitentiary get or to the Gulf each other that's the original church the Lord bless you while we pray conference with God so you see beyond an ending controversy God has seen his people and we ought to respect one another we are to love one another be honored Dominus my name is Barry we ought to love one another anyhow no matter we can't agree maybe they are possible they couldn't be they wanted to know who's going to be the greatest and many things John Moore Paulo there Peter Apollo they had a disagreement but the bonds above that's what we're trying to contend for today - oh the Methodists Baptists Presbyterians Lutheran's we're all together as Christians unite now we're trying to get fulfilled with the spirit of month Porsha - god that's division I was talking about the people insects of the head killed they say well they're not in the message I thought Jesus died for all so our heart goes to them analyse your churches I never won an interest or indifferent don't weekly trauma disagree if we will spend at a table one date and one kind of pie one another it would be just as much as right here see when it comes to felsham I know that we love one another though we don't do that then wish you we should do that and it will never go no further than God until we do today just don't forget it don't forget that the greatest get the ball gifts is loved those people ton of the men and angels and my body to be burned as a sacrifice understand all knowledge and so forth nothing so but when that which is perfect which is that if all of this pure gift this mortal together with love it won't hold any other mortal will break away you would love continue forever turning northward the one another Jesus said this will be long man know that you're my disciples when you love one for another the business man all men will know that you're my disciple God love one for the other that's the greatest evidence of the holy boat that I know when you can love one another sir that's the greatest commanding waiting we speak with tongues of men and angels it profits you nothing from that time we must love them mind a little one another and you don't see and you don't see your brother's mistake if he does make a mistake you never you never look over the top of it and you love in many how do you guys say love those that love you that does not not thus and do the same thing but love those love does something love you that's what shows that Spirit of God is in you because he loved you and when you were there is anything you don't you and that spirit in you you know make you love your enemy as you do your friend humble their self if the Spirit of God is in you you love the other for that person when any isn't wrong and then see just pray for them and know one another above everything below God and love one another in me we may be humble with God and I Ron one another and God blessed us and it's hard telling what he will do usually my church begins to get in numbers and get to getting a little bigger or something like that and they get away from that real thing their real thing and over the way was saying last night that 20 people we've got 20 problems that other people either problems Christ is the mystery of God reveal of do without one or another about everything don't one another don't no matter what the devil tries to say now you do all one great big sweet group now but remember I wanna see Satan one that that stayed that way no serve you shoot everything he has to bring somebody and to make make the starving dead brother Graham said the devil not had to photoshop we all got real shooting at each other but we know it sighs gonna win though thank you yeah you'll bring some critic or an unbeliever and sit him down cast him to fell share with you under the quietness and methane then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poisonous stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have that to do with anything else you stayed right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that you'll be saved too or that one or ever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another and stay with it fester see he's a shepherd and give him respect he leads you through and cost is ordained of God to do so [Applause] and the message divine love for the Rebbe talks about the Romanian when he was in the Portland Oregon he said he stood in August his spit in my face he said your snake in the grass I'll show you how my servant of God you are you deceiver I never said one word I just looked at him and all at once the Holy Spirit something that another what would you think of a man spit in your face why there's any temper about you it was right it sure it would here come two cups of the same two cups that good things and there has to beat the man not to take him off but I couldn't let them do it God had brought love in my heart for that moral being I thought it's not the man it's the devil's got him in that condition that man would be a normal man who wants to live who wants to learn to live like all the mentalism but it's the devil it's got him live in and love again to throw art for that man and the first thing you know that man drop that fell across my feet there said when divine love had projected suffering grace stepped in and took his place he'll do it every time what's that mean you know heels talked about the Hornets he said he said although I was cutting my grass he says the morning and I forgot there was a nest I'm gonna stuff the part around I'm more into that and better hitting my shirt up not sure when I hit that past week that more machine having a shirt on in a moment's time I was cover all over the Hornets you know what they are and big messed up Hornaday would kill you wait big fellows just bust on one time a little place named funny he said first a scare me then all of a sudden something happened to it began to quiet down then Warner still buzzing around now there's something to get this on but the Jew at home but God I haven't noticed whether it's true or not then instead of trying to fight and beat and smack them morning there was some kind of godly love coming over me and I thought poor little fellow you've got it right to build and that's that's the way God made for you to protect yourself and just and I just start being I'm sorry they did if I had to do it over again I don't want to disturb you I didn't mean to do it but I said I'm a servant of the Lord and his six children I is here to be prayed for and I got to hurt and mothers you're not on your little creature of God in the name of Jesus Christ go back to your nest not bother you and what was it it was that I pray for I could have been stunted in in love of God it was submitted hard that particular came forth and sever grace taking it over what could tell them warning speak and every in every one took a circle and flying line up the community military bunch of soldiers and went right straight back to their nests that the veteran thing yes thank you hey Lois you got the next year chubby yeah [Music]
