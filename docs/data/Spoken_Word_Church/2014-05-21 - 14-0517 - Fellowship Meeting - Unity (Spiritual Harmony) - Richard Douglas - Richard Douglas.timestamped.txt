[2:27] remember
[2:27] the book of ephesians chapter four
[2:31] i want to read verses one
[2:35] through 13.
[2:42] when you get it say amen amen amen
[2:45] aren't you thankful for the word amen
[2:48] david said i've heard thy word
[2:50] in my heart that i've sinned not against
[2:52] you he was already testifying of the
[2:55] holy spirit
[2:56] amen
[2:59] he says i therefore the prisoner of the
[3:03] lord beseech you
[3:04] that you walk worthy of the vocation
[3:06] wherein your call
[3:09] with all lowliness and meekness with
[3:11] long
[3:12] suffering forbearing one another in love
[3:15] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[3:17] spirit in the bond of peace
[3:20] there is one body one spirit even
[3:23] as you are called in one hope of your
[3:26] calling
[3:27] one lord one faith one baptism
[3:30] one god and father of all who is above
[3:34] all
[3:35] and through all and in you all
[3:38] but unto every one of us is given grace
[3:41] according to the measure of the gift of
[3:44] christ
[3:45] i'm just going to stop right there and
[3:46] we'll finish it later let's pray
[3:49] father what more can we say but
[3:52] thank you father amen father your grace
[3:55] has been more than sufficient for us
[3:58] lord
[3:59] father we're so thankful now lord we ask
[4:02] lord jesus that you'd come now
[4:04] the divine interpreter of the word that
[4:06] you would come and minister to our
[4:07] hearts lord
[4:08] would you set me aside lord would you
[4:11] get me out of your way lord i give
[4:13] myself completely to you
[4:15] for your honor and for your glory that
[4:16] you might speak to your children father
[4:18] we have one purpose
[4:20] and that's to see you glorified to see
[4:22] you magnified to see you lifted up
[4:24] father
[4:25] and for lord this service here today
[4:27] that we would leave
[4:29] a better christian lord and father
[4:31] there's only one
[4:32] way we'll ever do that is that's when
[4:34] you speak lord
[4:36] father because man can speak nothing to
[4:38] better us but lord you
[4:40] speak everything and it makes us for
[4:42] better than persons and father
[4:44] better walk of life father you're the
[4:46] one that does it all father so we
[4:48] surrender ourselves to you
[4:50] that you may be glorified for we ask it
[4:52] in jesus christ's name
[4:54] amen and amen you may be seated amen
[4:58] i like the way paul starts here he said
[5:01] out there for
[5:03] the prisoner of the lord you know you're
[5:05] a prisoner
[5:06] yes one way or another you're either
[5:08] gonna be a prisoner of the devil
[5:10] or you're going to be a prisoner for
[5:12] christ i mean we have
[5:15] and i'm glad god put us on free mortal
[5:17] agency that we
[5:19] have a choice in this he said we're no
[5:22] longer
[5:22] under bondage of sin right but we've
[5:25] been set free i'm thankful for that
[5:27] verse 4 said there is one body
[5:30] he said and one spirit even as you're
[5:33] called in one hope
[5:35] he said that one lord one faith one
[5:39] baptism one god and father of all who is
[5:41] above
[5:41] all through all and in you all right
[5:44] he's showing the oneness here for us
[5:46] he said in verse 13 says till we all
[5:50] come in the unity of the faith and the
[5:53] knowledge
[5:54] of the son of god unto a perfect man
[5:57] unto the measure
[5:58] of the statue of the fullness of christ
[6:02] i want to talk about this afternoon a
[6:03] little bit just for a few moments of
[6:05] your time
[6:06] spiritual harmony you know paul is
[6:08] talking about their hat that uh there's
[6:10] a christian here he has an atmosphere
[6:12] that he can create
[6:14] you know and god has you know god gets
[6:16] us to the place of where we have to
[6:17] have an atmosphere created for him to
[6:19] come in and to be one with us see
[6:22] jesus come and had a purpose in his life
[6:25] that he would bring
[6:26] god and man back together come on
[6:28] brother there had
[6:29] to be an atmosphere created there had to
[6:32] be one that would die and give his life
[6:34] for me and you that mean you could come
[6:36] into this spiritual harmony
[6:38] this relationship with christ because we
[6:40] were sold
[6:41] under sin we were sold out we were under
[6:44] a shotgun wedding and god
[6:46] who's so rich in mercy said i'm going to
[6:48] come down and i'm going to make a way
[6:50] back
[6:51] where we can come together in spiritual
[6:52] harmony and live
[6:54] in oneness with him and his word that's
[6:57] what he's desiring of us
[6:58] he's telling us here you know the first
[7:01] the most
[7:02] direct destructive uh part is when
[7:05] sin comes in that's what brought this
[7:08] force that separated god in man
[7:10] that bring this separation right every
[7:13] time that's what brings separation
[7:15] is sin come on for the bible said we
[7:17] have all sinned and come
[7:18] short of the glory so it had to take a
[7:20] redeemer to come
[7:22] and bring us back to this place one that
[7:23] was sinless without sin
[7:26] to bring us to the place where we're at
[7:27] today i'm so thankful that god sent us
[7:30] a message that could bring us back to
[7:32] the oneness
[7:33] of the word the truth not depending upon
[7:36] any man or any idea or any any
[7:39] intellectualism
[7:40] but we're depending upon the word is
[7:42] bringing us back to this maturity
[7:44] the full word first of all to have
[7:47] unity requires truth amen that's one
[7:50] thing we'll never come together
[7:52] under unity except truth hallelujah
[7:55] if it ain't the truth there's no way we
[7:57] can unite to anything
[7:59] except the truth the bride can has no
[8:02] doubt or no desire
[8:04] to unite to anything but truth because
[8:07] he said you shall know the truth
[8:08] and the truth shall set you free and who
[8:11] the son is set free
[8:12] is free indeed see jesus whole purpose
[8:15] here
[8:15] in saint john 10 30 he said i
[8:18] and my father are one amen
[8:22] see that's what he's desired for us to
[8:23] be is to be one with him
[8:26] amen one with his word he said
[8:29] sanctify them through thy word that word
[8:32] is truth
[8:33] and this message was the only thing that
[8:36] could bring us to a place
[8:38] of a true sanctification that we could
[8:40] become one
[8:41] with the word that would bring a rapture
[8:44] to get us in a position
[8:45] to receive a rapture oh my what a mighty
[8:49] god
[8:50] amen we got something to be excited
[8:52] about we got more than just
[8:54] fables we got the truth and the truth
[8:56] has made us free
[8:59] real true faith is men's weakness
[9:03] leaning on god's strength that's what
[9:04] dale moody said
[9:06] he said real faith is men's weakness
[9:09] leaning on god's strength
[9:12] we have to come to a place to realize
[9:14] that we are leaning on his strength
[9:16] and him alone he is our strength paul
[9:18] said when i
[9:19] am weak then he's strong it's not about
[9:22] a certain personality
[9:23] it's not about a man it's about god
[9:25] we're here for one purpose that christ
[9:26] may be lifted up
[9:29] spirit means or refers to as the holy
[9:31] spirit unity
[9:32] without the holy ghost you cannot
[9:34] understand the thing of god because
[9:36] we see nicodemus come and he asked him
[9:39] these questions and he said you
[9:40] you can't even understand you being a
[9:42] teacher and you can't even understand
[9:44] these things
[9:45] see it took of earth it took a
[9:47] born-again experience to be able to
[9:48] understand the word of god
[9:49] not this head it's a spirit it's a
[9:51] divine revelation that god has to give
[9:53] us
[9:56] man i'm thankful for the grace of god
[9:58] ain't you when a person accepts christ
[10:01] and lets him come into his heart it
[10:04] brings a union
[10:06] and the union brings this holy spirit
[10:09] that brings us and marries us to christ
[10:12] that's what this message is it marries
[10:14] to christ
[10:17] what is grace unmerited favor with god
[10:23] unity you know there's all kinds of
[10:25] youth there's a unity of a calling
[10:27] we have a call to serve one another
[10:32] not me myself and now but to serve one
[10:34] another
[10:35] we're not here for ourselves we're here
[10:37] to serve one another
[10:38] brother brown said he said when you're
[10:40] living your life for others you're
[10:41] standing in heaven in the face
[10:44] we've got so many so much selfishness
[10:46] around a lot of
[10:47] times around the mess this they think
[10:48] it's being myself and now but it's
[10:50] serving
[10:51] we are here we're sorry even though sons
[10:53] we're here to serve
[10:54] come on one another gloria we got the
[10:58] unity of the ministry
[11:00] you know the unity of the mirror the
[11:01] spirit and the bride are saying the same
[11:03] thing
[11:04] not two different things one self same
[11:07] word
[11:08] it's not what i think it's not what
[11:09] brother death thinks it's what god
[11:12] thinks
[11:15] he said endeavoring to keep the unity of
[11:17] the spirit
[11:18] in the bond of peace you can't have
[11:21] peace
[11:21] in what you believe until you receive
[11:23] the holy spirit the revelation of it
[11:25] that's why we see so many times brother
[11:27] brown said talk about
[11:28] so many people tossed to and fro because
[11:31] they don't have the spirit
[11:33] the spirit of god brings unity to
[11:35] another lets you know who you
[11:36] are and what you're here for
[11:40] oh we have a unity with a purpose
[11:44] our unity as the purpose of the bride of
[11:46] jesus christ is to be like him
[11:48] amen not to be like a church certain
[11:51] church
[11:51] or a certain minister to be like christ
[11:55] oh i'm thankful for the grace of god
[11:58] and the message works that i have done
[12:02] bear witness of me 1951 he said look at
[12:04] the disunity in our nation
[12:07] what it's doing look what's happened
[12:09] right now
[12:10] right now this was infinity war we can
[12:13] say that now
[12:15] he said right in the time of war isn't
[12:18] that
[12:19] horrible he said that's a disgrace to
[12:23] our nation
[12:24] he said well it's more than a disgrace
[12:27] to jesus christ a church
[12:29] in this unity it's just before the
[12:32] coming of the lord
[12:33] and the loosening of the antichrist on
[12:36] the earth and here we are
[12:38] separated with denominational barriers
[12:41] i'm methodist he said praise god
[12:44] you could shake him he said you couldn't
[12:46] shake me i'm baptist
[12:48] i'm a seamless of god i'm church of god
[12:51] i'm a pentecostal church
[12:53] oh my he said where are we anyhow
[12:57] he said that's right what's any of us
[13:01] nothing but what god would let us be
[13:06] it's all in the grace of god so let's
[13:09] look to him
[13:10] praise him and and our associate
[13:14] with our brother we can associate on the
[13:18] word
[13:18] right the bible said come and let us
[13:20] reason together over what the word
[13:23] all right jesus said let every man's
[13:25] word be a lie
[13:27] and mind the truth that's good enough
[13:28] for me that'll be good enough for you
[13:32] brother said i didn't i preached just
[13:34] what paul preached
[13:35] right what else could you say right what
[13:38] more could you add to it
[13:40] how could you take away from it it's
[13:42] already finished
[13:43] it's already been said what's supposed
[13:45] to be said right it's already done
[13:48] people are arguing this has got to be
[13:49] done that's gotta be it's already done
[13:51] come on what we gotta comes to the unity
[13:54] is of faith
[13:55] we gotta believe it we gotta leave it
[13:58] right oh my what almighty god
[14:02] remember paul spoke to the corinthians
[14:04] and he said
[14:05] well he said well one one would say i'm
[14:08] a paul
[14:09] i'm of apollos i'm of cephas
[14:13] he said who is paul
[14:16] who is apollos he said i sowed
[14:20] applause water but god gave the increase
[14:24] without the increase there would be
[14:26] nothing but a wet rotten seed
[14:30] takes the quickening power of the holy
[14:32] spirit to bring it alive
[14:35] and that alone what does the word unity
[14:39] mean it means
[14:40] the state of being united or joined as a
[14:42] whole
[14:44] this message don't think is going to
[14:46] bring the bride together as a whole
[14:48] not a toe over here and a foot over here
[14:51] god's not going to have a dismembered
[14:52] body
[14:54] they're all going to come into place
[14:55] what's going to bring us all into place
[14:57] the word amen oh amen
[15:00] the state of being in full agreement
[15:04] robert said that entirely to the token
[15:06] that's why there's so many people that
[15:07] don't have the tokens they're not in
[15:09] full agreement
[15:10] not with me not with you but with the
[15:12] words that's right
[15:15] oh spiritual harmony with the word
[15:19] this unity means just the opposite lack
[15:21] of unity of record
[15:25] well i can't do this and i can't hey you
[15:27] can't until you come under the headship
[15:29] of the word
[15:31] it's not the headset of the pastor it's
[15:33] not the headship of
[15:34] the evangelist it's the headship of the
[15:36] word
[15:38] and the capstone is only going to come
[15:40] down on the full body of christ
[15:44] until we come together to the unity of
[15:46] the faith
[15:47] i like what david said in psalms 33 1 he
[15:50] says behold how good
[15:52] and how pleasant it is for brethren to
[15:54] dwell together in unity
[15:57] what is that unity the word that's
[15:59] what's brought us here
[16:00] this afternoon the word has brought us
[16:02] here together
[16:04] stop being some organization or some
[16:06] man's talk it's been the vindicated
[16:09] words brought us together
[16:10] we can come and say amen
[16:14] oh brothers what a mighty god oh
[16:17] i'm so in love with jesus ain't you
[16:20] you know one of the main reasons the
[16:22] world lacks unity
[16:25] you know and lies broken because man has
[16:28] disunified himself from god right
[16:32] that's what happens to a lot of
[16:33] ministers they get the place where they
[16:34] say well i'm going to do what i want to
[16:36] do and say what i want to
[16:37] but brother said we don't have a thought
[16:39] coming we don't have a say in this thing
[16:42] the holy ghost says it glory oh brothers
[16:45] and sisters
[16:46] it's not what mine in your thoughts is
[16:48] it's what god says
[16:50] unity you know there's power in unity
[16:53] there's strength in it
[16:55] see that's what satan wants to do he
[16:57] wants to put this little ism here and
[16:58] this little israelite the reign
[16:59] separation because he knows
[17:01] unity there's power right here when we
[17:04] all get the character of christ
[17:06] we're going to have the power it already
[17:08] lays within us but god's not going to
[17:10] let us have it
[17:11] until we get the right character because
[17:13] he said
[17:14] power without character is satanic
[17:18] but power with characters fit to rule
[17:21] come on
[17:22] how's he going to let you sit down with
[17:23] him if you ain't fit to rule with him
[17:26] we all want to get into get in the seat
[17:28] but we don't want to be under the mold
[17:30] and the tuner tutorship of the word we
[17:32] want to get to our
[17:33] own way
[17:37] oh my what a mighty god
[17:40] where where we need to go look even the
[17:43] stars
[17:44] testify of unity you don't hear the
[17:47] stars complaining
[17:48] right hey look you're brighter than me
[17:50] north star i need you to come over here
[17:51] it's my turn to shine or the sun and the
[17:54] moon they don't argue
[17:56] they work together in harmony it's not
[18:00] we're not here to make one man
[18:01] better than the other one man lest we're
[18:04] here to lift christ up he's the only
[18:05] great one among us
[18:10] until we realize that we'll never be
[18:13] able to come into the unity of christ
[18:14] like we should
[18:15] the stars testifying
[18:18] you know what the main task of ministers
[18:22] is not theology but what it is
[18:25] is neology we've got too much theology
[18:29] around the message
[18:30] we need some neology where you've had an
[18:33] experience with god where you went on
[18:35] the back side of the desert
[18:36] and you had experience with the holy
[18:38] ghost your burning birth
[18:40] experience then that takes away all your
[18:43] ideas
[18:44] takes away your stinking thinking
[18:47] oh i'm thankful for that because i tell
[18:50] you my
[18:51] my thinking stinks but his is perfect in
[18:54] all
[18:56] the only way we can unite is we unite to
[18:58] the word
[19:00] in the message the total total
[19:01] deliverance 1954. but brown said
[19:04] and that's the same way it is with the
[19:06] church when the church
[19:09] is away from its principles it can
[19:12] never i like it never serve the saints
[19:15] well
[19:16] right when they got to he said we've got
[19:19] to stay together
[19:21] he said got to be unified he said we've
[19:24] got to be
[19:25] one heart and one accord or we'll never
[19:28] serve god or his people right unless
[19:31] we're one heart
[19:33] and one accord right to stand by the
[19:35] principles of the bible
[19:37] and the things that god has saith that's
[19:40] right
[19:41] we must always stand by them
[19:45] gloria i tell you if you don't stand for
[19:48] jesus you're going to fall for anything
[19:50] that's what's wrong they're not standing
[19:52] for jesus they've been following the man
[19:55] they've got their eyes on the man so
[19:57] long they forgot to who
[19:58] the brother was bringing to us christ
[20:02] we got to get our eyes off man and start
[20:03] looking to christ
[20:05] he's the only one that's going to get us
[20:06] out of here he's the only hope we got
[20:11] in acts chapter 4 verse 32 they were in
[20:14] the same
[20:15] heart and soul christ was preeminent in
[20:19] all of it right
[20:20] no schisms no isms not my way not your
[20:24] way god's way
[20:25] glory in beautiful spiritual harmony
[20:28] they continued together
[20:30] the holy ghost brought them together the
[20:33] word bring them together
[20:34] they preached and they taught the gospel
[20:36] exhorting the people
[20:37] to believe what paul or james or john
[20:40] to believe christ the word
[20:45] they had fellowship around the word
[20:49] they believed and kept the commandments
[20:52] because there was the holy ghost keeping
[20:53] them
[20:54] they couldn't do it paul come and told
[20:56] peter said you ain't been able to keep
[20:57] the law
[20:58] why are you trying to make them you know
[21:01] the only way you're going to keep the
[21:02] law is the holy ghost
[21:03] right oh i'm thankful for that they
[21:06] prayed together
[21:07] holding fast a profession of one faith
[21:10] this is not many little messages or many
[21:12] little ideas
[21:13] it's one message christ jesus and him
[21:16] alone
[21:18] oh i'm so thankful for that ain't you
[21:21] we are uniting with the word
[21:25] not a certain idea or a certain thought
[21:27] we're uniting
[21:29] back to the faith that was once
[21:31] delivered to the saints
[21:33] it could only be in this day back to the
[21:36] full restoration of the word
[21:40] see paul had to decrease because he was
[21:43] bringing those ephesians
[21:44] to rapture but it wasn't time there were
[21:47] six more
[21:47] church ages there had to come through
[21:50] that span of time
[21:52] because there was a seventh church age
[21:55] that had to see it
[21:56] had to manifest it what we need to do
[21:58] just get out of the way and say god
[22:00] take away all my thoughts take away all
[22:03] my ideas all my will just let me
[22:06] be what you want me to be thank you it
[22:08] may be humble enough
[22:10] and sincere enough just to let you have
[22:12] your way in my life
[22:14] the church and the bride and the word is
[22:15] being
[22:17] being they're becoming one until the
[22:20] very word itself
[22:21] is working out the words of the
[22:23] bridegroom in the bride
[22:25] right he said you speak it
[22:28] i'll perform it she unites herself what
[22:32] under the word back to the word
[22:37] she's becoming one with the word
[22:41] oh my man i love that
[22:44] the bridegroom and the bride are saying
[22:47] the same thing
[22:48] right not her thoughts
[22:51] but what he's thinking she's saying
[22:53] right amen he said you become so in tune
[22:56] with him
[22:56] that when he does this we'll know
[22:58] exactly what he wants
[23:00] just like a man and wife they come in
[23:02] such harmony
[23:03] that all he has to do he's so confident
[23:05] in us that he just do this and say
[23:07] oh yes i know brother pageant will do
[23:10] what i want him to do now
[23:11] he's in harmony with me i just know yes
[23:14] that's exactly what
[23:15] his word is as good as mine glory
[23:19] my brother christine that's where we're
[23:21] coming to
[23:22] uniting to the headship of the word
[23:24] glory
[23:26] see they can't come to the headship of
[23:28] the word unless they've had a word birth
[23:30] they had an intellectual conception of
[23:32] it they had a good
[23:33] thought they had a good they had good
[23:35] reasoning
[23:36] that they made it real to themselves
[23:39] through their own way
[23:40] but they never had the word birth that's
[23:42] why they're falling away
[23:44] they're having somebody has to fulfill
[23:46] the scriptures said they're shall arise
[23:48] scoffers
[23:49] where can you get a real scruple from he
[23:51] has to come out the message
[23:53] the methodist the baptist all those
[23:54] can't scoff they don't know nothing
[23:55] about it
[23:57] it has to come out from under this
[24:01] that's where they're coming from we
[24:04] ought to feel sorry for them
[24:06] they're fulfilling their day now what
[24:08] i'm saying god let me fulfill my word
[24:10] your word for your day in my life
[24:14] what a mighty god she's becoming the
[24:17] word
[24:18] the bride the hearer of the word come
[24:21] together
[24:21] they become one the word becomes you
[24:25] and you become the word
[24:30] that's what i'm what does he do what
[24:32] we're doing restoring it back
[24:34] to the pentecostal faith not a
[24:36] denomination
[24:37] an experience with the same
[24:41] message and the same signs right
[24:44] they're made evidence by the power of
[24:47] god
[24:48] showing his evidence in us oh i'm so
[24:50] thankful for that
[24:52] right oh what almighty god she unites
[24:55] herself with him
[24:57] which is the word not an organization or
[25:00] a church creed
[25:02] unite with christ and be sure
[25:05] it's him right right
[25:09] but you careful because they're hauling
[25:10] unite and unite
[25:14] not that did we come in one accord we
[25:16] remember we remember back in the days
[25:18] when there was jehoshaphat and ahab
[25:22] they was calling for a uniting come
[25:26] together
[25:27] there's 400 of us and just one of him
[25:30] and they had word they had the word but
[25:34] it was misrepresented
[25:35] it was misplaced it wasn't for him to do
[25:37] it right
[25:38] it was for a certain person to do it god
[25:41] has a certain man to do it
[25:44] what we have to do is get in our place
[25:46] and work with the program
[25:49] no matter how they screamed they
[25:50] hollered but it still didn't come to
[25:53] pass
[25:53] the wrong man was trying to fulfill it
[25:56] that's what's wrong around the message
[25:57] people are trying to make it happen
[25:59] instead of just giving up and let god
[26:01] make it happen
[26:08] what about that in a lying spirit said i
[26:10] will go down
[26:12] i'll go down and get in those prophets
[26:15] huh because they were saying they wasn't
[26:18] saying the whole word of god
[26:20] they just had a problem took a little
[26:22] scripture and said well this is all
[26:23] right with me
[26:25] see a lot of people taking a little
[26:26] quote this is good enough for me
[26:29] i'll take the whole counsel of god the
[26:32] whole word of god
[26:34] how can two walk together unless they
[26:35] agree
[26:37] we can't even the only thing we can
[26:39] agree the holy ghost agrees with the
[26:40] word
[26:40] that's all he eats that's his diet
[26:43] that's his
[26:44] that's his diet he eats the word and
[26:47] nothing else
[26:48] he don't care what you think what men
[26:50] you think it ought to be like
[26:53] he just does he just wants to hear what
[26:54] the word says it is
[26:56] hmm you know nature's rely on a leader
[27:01] sons all of a sudden there's a little
[27:03] duck rises up in the park
[27:05] and he starts squawking louder than any
[27:07] of the rest of him
[27:08] and he starts making sense to those who
[27:11] ordain to follow him
[27:13] but it's just a false quack to the rest
[27:15] of them
[27:17] it don't affect the geese it don't
[27:19] affect the
[27:20] the buzzers it don't affect the crows it
[27:22] just affects the ducks
[27:26] and they come under headship they unite
[27:28] on that leadership
[27:30] that's what god has done in our day he
[27:32] sent a voice crying
[27:34] out and we heard it we heard an eagle
[27:37] scream
[27:38] we left our barnyard we said papa
[27:41] it's you that's right
[27:44] oh what a mighty god
[27:48] trouble with man is he don't know who
[27:51] his leader is
[27:53] that's what's wrong i can tell you who
[27:55] your leader is the holy ghost
[27:57] because he said i'll send you the holy
[27:59] ghost and he shall lead and guide you
[28:01] into all truth
[28:03] and you're thankful for that oh
[28:06] i'm so thankful for the truth this truth
[28:09] really
[28:10] has done a lot for us a lot of times we
[28:12] take it for granted
[28:13] what this truth has brought us to it's
[28:16] brought us to full freedom
[28:18] we're able to exercise our freedom as a
[28:20] christian we can worship god in
[28:22] spirit and in truth
[28:25] not just worshipping them in spirit a
[28:27] lot of people just worship him in spirit
[28:30] some just have truth but he said i'm
[28:31] requiring you to worship me in spirit
[28:34] and in truth it's a unity
[28:38] it's a uniting in the message preserver
[28:41] perseverance he said in 1962 he said if
[28:44] you'd only look up
[28:46] unity comes from god right
[28:49] not man comes from god the power of god
[28:53] when the believer the creation here on
[28:55] earth
[28:56] that god has created is united with god
[29:00] right now then there comes a unity that
[29:03] gives faith
[29:04] he said and when a man sees that he's
[29:07] persistent
[29:08] nobody is going to shake him brother
[29:10] dale i don't care how
[29:12] loud they holler how much they try to
[29:14] disprove it's still the truth
[29:16] and nothing but the truth
[29:21] i've not been persuaded by man paul
[29:23] wasn't persuaded by the apostles he said
[29:25] i went on the backside of the dead
[29:26] that's where rod a lot of them just
[29:28] followed the man because
[29:29] he said a certain thing but they didn't
[29:31] go and get the experience
[29:33] like paul did paul said i didn't confer
[29:36] with none of them
[29:36] i went on the back side of the desert
[29:38] and he showed me to come back saying the
[29:40] same thing he wasn't saying nothing
[29:42] different
[29:42] he was saying the same thing baptizing
[29:44] the same way they were
[29:46] preaching the same thing they was
[29:49] that's spiritual harmony harvest time
[29:52] 1964 he said oh surely god
[29:54] would be in this if we could get
[29:56] together
[29:58] and make a whole world council of
[29:59] churches surely god would be in it
[30:02] he wants unity he wants brotherhood
[30:06] with himself
[30:10] that's good enough that's where i want
[30:12] it
[30:13] he wants you with himself not with the
[30:15] world
[30:16] a brotherhood with himself worship to
[30:19] himself
[30:20] that's what he died for that's what you
[30:24] should want that's what he requires me
[30:26] and you to do is to worship him
[30:28] that way he desires that
[30:32] satan's got a unity called the
[30:35] antichrist
[30:36] he's bringing them together they're
[30:39] throwing commercials they're doing all
[30:40] this come on back home
[30:42] come on back home that's not my home
[30:45] i'm not my home that's mama calling
[30:49] them not me papa's calling me
[30:54] when mama calls she don't deter me i'm
[30:56] listening for
[30:57] papa
[31:01] come on back come on back i never was
[31:04] there
[31:05] if i ever was an uh attribute of god i
[31:07] still am
[31:08] right huh jesus said i came from god and
[31:10] i'm going back
[31:12] he asked us where were you brother
[31:13] christian when the sons and daughters
[31:16] worshiped and shouted brother patrick we
[31:18] was there
[31:19] and i'm going back there not over there
[31:22] it's not going to be here i'm going to
[31:23] meet him over there
[31:24] in the air under the headship of the
[31:27] word
[31:28] can i read you a little quote by charles
[31:31] spurgeon way back in his day
[31:33] talking about the same kind of unity
[31:35] trying to be back then
[31:36] i just love this really stuck me he said
[31:39] to remain divided is sinful
[31:41] did not our lord pray that
[31:44] that they may be one even as we are one
[31:47] saint john 17 22.
[31:49] he said in the course of ecumenical
[31:51] voices keep
[31:52] harping the unity tomb he said what
[31:55] they're saying is christians of all
[31:57] doctrinal shades and beliefs
[31:59] must come together in one visible
[32:01] organization
[32:03] regardless unite unite listen to what he
[32:06] says
[32:07] he said such teaching is false
[32:11] reckless and dangerous he said truth
[32:14] alone must determine our alignments
[32:18] truth comes before unity
[32:21] unity without truth is hazardous
[32:24] our lord in saint john 17 said he said
[32:27] it must
[32:28] be read in its full context we've heard
[32:30] him read this
[32:31] if you've seen that little thing on the
[32:33] thing where he was called them all
[32:34] together he read this
[32:36] he said sanctify them through thy truth
[32:39] thy word is truth he said only those
[32:41] sanctified through the word can be one
[32:44] in christ
[32:45] to teach any other wise is to betray
[32:49] the gospel
[32:53] sounds like sounds like a winner to me
[32:58] any other things false false we got to
[33:01] come to the place saying lord
[33:02] this is the truth lord help me to line
[33:05] up with
[33:06] what everybody's trying to do is they've
[33:07] tried to take the message and make it
[33:09] fit them instead of letting the message
[33:10] take them and fit it same way with the
[33:14] bible
[33:15] what is the message jesus christ the
[33:18] same yesterday
[33:19] today and forever unchangeable he said
[33:22] here you here's what i'm the lord thy
[33:24] god and i
[33:25] change not for nobody for you
[33:28] for me for anybody he don't change
[33:31] that's what i love about him
[33:33] his first words just found the word amen
[33:36] in the message in absolute 1963 he said
[33:39] we're we he said now you see
[33:42] we are not a divided people we've got to
[33:45] be in unity
[33:47] each one of us is holding a part of god
[33:50] right when we can start seeing that into
[33:52] one another we'll start treating one
[33:53] another a lot different than we do
[33:55] what we do we don't we're not seeing
[33:58] that part of god in each other
[34:00] we're too busy looking at the outward
[34:02] and he said try the spirit
[34:04] know whether it's a god he said that we
[34:07] must come together
[34:08] and then the pillar of fire is
[34:10] manifested
[34:12] your little late brother donnie my
[34:13] little lip your little lip comes again
[34:15] and that brings the pillow fire
[34:18] he said in the wholeness in the fullness
[34:21] of it
[34:22] he said when his church sits together in
[34:24] heavenly places
[34:25] the fullness of the power of god is in
[34:28] his church
[34:29] each one of us holding spiritual gifts
[34:31] and spiritual offices
[34:33] coming together brings that pillar of
[34:36] fire
[34:36] back again we want to see the pillow
[34:40] fight
[34:41] we got to come together on the headship
[34:42] of the word lay down our little penny
[34:44] any difference just
[34:46] don't mean nothing to god hmm
[34:49] let me read you something
[34:52] in the message harvest time
[34:56] he said god is uniting his bride she's
[34:59] coming together from the east
[35:00] from the west from the north and south
[35:03] there's a uniting time
[35:05] and that's on right now what is she
[35:08] uniting for the rapture
[35:10] he said amen god is getting ready yes
[35:14] sir
[35:14] united what is she uniting with with the
[35:17] word
[35:18] boy i love that for all the heavens and
[35:21] earth will pass away
[35:22] but my word shall never pass away she's
[35:25] uniting herself
[35:26] with thus saith the lord
[35:29] regardless of what denomination or
[35:32] anybody else say
[35:33] she's uniting herself she's getting
[35:35] ready why
[35:36] she is the bride he said that's right
[35:39] and she's united herself with the
[35:41] bridegroom
[35:42] and the bridegroom is the word glory
[35:46] in the beginning was the word and the
[35:47] word was with god and the word was god
[35:50] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[35:52] among us
[35:54] little messiahs is what we are he said
[35:56] in the church and the bride and the word
[35:59] is becoming one
[36:00] until the very word itself is working
[36:02] out the works of the bridegroom amen
[36:05] he said you see it a uniting time no
[36:08] more
[36:09] join the church not no more this but
[36:12] flee
[36:12] from everything and tie to jesus christ
[36:15] see
[36:16] it's the uniting time god's uniting his
[36:19] bride
[36:19] together bringing it back just exactly
[36:23] uniting the word of his promise he said
[36:26] first thessalonians says
[36:28] that the saints that are asleep in the
[36:30] dust of the earth will awaken
[36:33] and we will unite with them the living
[36:35] ones
[36:36] with the ones that's been dead that's
[36:38] right we will unite before we even go up
[36:41] there
[36:42] because the bride will be complete when
[36:44] she gets there
[36:46] the ones that are living that have
[36:48] united himself with the word
[36:50] and those that are gone already that did
[36:52] that
[36:53] he said all of it comes together to make
[36:56] one great union
[36:57] of uniting before going up there
[37:00] glory amen thank you lord that's good
[37:03] enough for me
[37:05] you can call it say what you want to but
[37:07] it's good enough for me
[37:08] hey man call me crazy but i'm crazy
[37:12] happy
[37:13] amen i may have been this happy
[37:16] before look at what the prophet said in
[37:18] here in the message shalom
[37:20] what's causing this the darkness is
[37:22] separating itself from the light
[37:24] it came the stronger the light comes to
[37:27] bring this uniting of the word the bride
[37:28] and the one becoming sir
[37:30] the darkness is separating the light is
[37:32] forcing it to do it
[37:34] it's forcing if you're not light you
[37:36] can't connect to it you can't unite to
[37:38] it
[37:39] it's forcing on brother christian
[37:40] forcing them to do this
[37:42] he said it's coming to bring when the
[37:44] light comes i'm going to reveal it
[37:46] and the lights come he said
[37:49] god has caused it the light
[37:52] is doing it it's not me it's not you
[37:56] god has caused it the light is doing it
[37:59] see the light is pressing itself in such
[38:02] a way until the darkness
[38:04] has to congratulate itself together
[38:08] congregate itself together he said they
[38:11] had a chance to accept it
[38:13] and they wouldn't do it so he said
[38:16] condensed itself so it's condensed
[38:18] itself
[38:20] and they that do that by the putting the
[38:22] church together
[38:23] and the council of churches and the
[38:25] uniting it with pagan darkness
[38:28] when they so firmly disagree with one
[38:30] another
[38:31] but they had to go together
[38:34] to make the night come upon the people
[38:38] they've had to to bring the full
[38:40] darkness for them
[38:42] amen the only light they've been walking
[38:43] in is what god has left here for the
[38:45] bride and now there's making them come
[38:46] together to make it darker on them
[38:48] a greater condemnation lord
[38:52] oh think about it brothers and sisters
[38:54] he said in the message oneness
[38:56] he said now don't you see the great
[38:58] picture he said we in flesh
[39:01] are different we're like a byproduct
[39:04] he said a created being by holy wedlock
[39:07] he said but in the spirit we are sons
[39:09] and daughters
[39:10] not some other spirit but the spirit of
[39:13] the living god
[39:15] lest it live in you he said cry been
[39:18] paul say christ in you the hope of glory
[39:20] we are in his likeness in his unity
[39:23] in the perfect image of the living god
[39:25] because we are sons and daughters
[39:27] not separated but the same spirit the
[39:30] same god
[39:31] the same person joined in wedlock to the
[39:34] eternal
[39:35] see how god planned it that we should be
[39:38] not different but him
[39:42] not as some other being of some other
[39:44] tribe
[39:45] but a real union an offspring of all of
[39:48] the almighty
[39:49] done by a holy union right
[39:52] you're the offspring of god glory huh so
[39:55] if he's your father
[39:56] and your his spirit lives in you you're
[39:58] gonna work out the acts of him
[40:00] just like you had the spirit of john
[40:01] delanger you're gonna have a criminal
[40:03] spirit in you
[40:04] you're gonna want to kill you're gonna
[40:05] want to rob that's how he said try the
[40:07] spirit know whether it's a god or not
[40:09] you got that spirit of arguing and
[40:11] wanting to fight listen this
[40:12] really just blowed me away when brother
[40:14] brown said this in the message one this
[40:16] he said the disciples even walking with
[40:18] jesus
[40:19] they didn't have oneness think about it
[40:22] he said they didn't have any unity
[40:26] no they argued
[40:30] sounds like a lot of message people
[40:31] don't who's going to be the bishop after
[40:34] this
[40:36] everybody's been trying to take brother
[40:37] brown's place since he left
[40:40] i want to be the big honcho now they
[40:43] ain't nobody big among except christ
[40:45] he said who's the greatest among us he
[40:48] said they couldn't even believe
[40:50] jesus they couldn't understand him
[40:53] they said they'll speak us in riddles
[40:57] tell us plainly what you mean he said
[41:00] there was no unity between the disciples
[41:02] and jesus
[41:03] think about that huh he said
[41:07] jesus to he said
[41:10] jesus to them he told them don't you
[41:13] preach
[41:13] no more or even try right if you're
[41:16] going to act like that don't even try
[41:19] he said wait in jerusalem i'm going to
[41:21] see you i'm going to send you
[41:23] a promise that will unify you then right
[41:27] and nobody's saying well you know me and
[41:28] james is going to sit over here and
[41:30] y'all going to be
[41:31] we're going to be the main one here now
[41:33] peter you just watch us
[41:35] we're gonna really show out now he said
[41:37] see god wasn't in them yet
[41:40] they were just associated all right
[41:43] well we've got a lot of people just
[41:45] associated with this message listen to
[41:46] what the brother brim said this really
[41:47] stuck me when he said they were just
[41:49] associated in fellowship with listen to
[41:52] what the prophet said he said that's
[41:54] many good men today they wasn't one with
[41:57] god yet
[41:58] what brings that one is the holy ghost
[42:00] right we've got a lot of associations
[42:02] around the message but we want to be one
[42:04] with god
[42:06] what a unity when god united himself in
[42:09] the human body
[42:10] the greatest of all unitings he said god
[42:13] united
[42:13] with man left his great strand of being
[42:17] god
[42:17] and stretched forth his tent and took in
[42:19] humanity
[42:21] and became one of them unity that
[42:24] brought
[42:24] peace between god and man forever
[42:28] not this unity brought peace between god
[42:32] and man forever he said
[42:33] how thankful we are to be right
[42:38] my goodness couldn't even get along with
[42:40] one another
[42:41] huh it's wrong a lot of people well i
[42:43] got i got
[42:44] i'm gonna prove my point here you know i
[42:47] don't have a point to prove
[42:49] it's already been proved that's what god
[42:51] said that's all i got if i say what he
[42:53] says brother
[42:54] just said say what i say and you'll be
[42:55] all right you know
[42:57] but you can't even say what the problem
[42:58] said unless you've got the holy ghost
[43:00] you'll throw your little your little two
[43:02] cents in there
[43:03] then you know what that just throws it
[43:04] all out of country continuity
[43:08] when the prophet said we don't got to
[43:09] say coming in this thing i'm glad that
[43:12] boy what i say i'd be a lot of people be
[43:14] in trouble from what i said brother dale
[43:15] you know the same for you
[43:18] faith the faith of abraham as long as
[43:21] the devil
[43:22] can keep you separated that's as good as
[43:24] he wants it
[43:27] wow he said you'll never
[43:30] go forward like that right he said do
[43:33] you know how the indians lost this
[43:35] nation
[43:37] to the white man they were not united
[43:40] he said we're going to lose it again by
[43:42] not being united
[43:46] look at america now we've got this with
[43:48] this thought
[43:50] republicans is fighting among the
[43:51] republicans the democrats fighting among
[43:52] the democrats the impenders fighting
[43:54] ain't no unity what brings you to the
[43:57] word
[43:58] right oh i'm glad we got the truth
[44:02] the truth has set us free
[44:06] where i'm fixing to finish here he said
[44:08] i will restore 1950 cent 1957.
[44:12] he said pentecost has a disease
[44:16] a disease it's got a lot of fungus
[44:19] growing on it
[44:21] he said that's right all of our churches
[44:24] have fungus growing on them
[44:26] so boy he just sucked us right in there
[44:28] we better watch it
[44:29] we need god to spiritually examine and
[44:31] say lord what are we
[44:32] we don't want no fungus on us we don't
[44:34] know no fungus
[44:36] among us we could say it that way he
[44:38] said we've left
[44:40] let that old palmer worm
[44:43] does that name sound familiar
[44:46] he said come along with his stinger and
[44:49] break down
[44:50] brotherhood break down unity among us
[44:53] paul said in the bible that he wanted us
[44:56] to all
[44:57] speak the same thing he wanted us to all
[44:59] be in unity
[45:01] amen aren't you thankful for that amen
[45:04] i'm so thankful for the grace of god
[45:06] aren't you i'm going to read one more
[45:08] quote and i'm going to let you stand
[45:10] amen he said in an absolute he said
[45:14] now you see we're not a divided people
[45:17] we've got to be in unity because each
[45:19] one of us is holding a part of god
[45:22] and we must come together and then the
[45:24] pillar fires manifested i just read that
[45:26] he said it again in absolute
[45:28] i said out of the mouth of two or three
[45:29] witnesses said the wholeness the
[45:31] fullness
[45:32] when his church sits together in
[45:34] heavenly places
[45:35] then the fullness of the power of god in
[45:37] his church
[45:38] each one of us holding spiritual gifts
[45:41] spiritual offices coming together brings
[45:43] that pillar fire back
[45:45] we want the pillow fire working among us
[45:46] again then we got to come back to the
[45:48] word
[45:49] come back to the truth the word of god
[45:52] has set us free
[45:53] right amen we can't unite ourselves
[45:55] nothing but the word
[45:56] there's nothing wrong with having
[45:58] fellowship right now loving one of jesus
[46:00] didn't say stop loving one another
[46:03] he said let's unite to the word now
[46:06] we'll go so far but when
[46:07] this when it's contrary to the word then
[46:09] we'll say wait a minute i'm gonna keep
[46:11] on walking with the word
[46:12] right i'm gonna pray for you that you
[46:14] get back in line that's right
[46:16] probably said some of them got out of
[46:17] step said he had to scream stay in line
[46:20] little lebron
[46:21] that's all the ministers are doing the
[46:23] fivefold mystery stay in line little bro
[46:26] stay in line with what the word the
[46:28] message of the hour the truth
[46:30] that's what's wrong us here let's stand
[46:34] amen ain't you glad of that wanting us
[46:36] to stay in line with the truth
[46:38] we don't have a social god this is not
[46:40] an association
[46:42] this is a born to getting spirits you're
[46:43] born into this kingdom
[46:45] you're not just associated with a
[46:47] handshake or an a thing or
[46:49] some kind of intellectual thought of
[46:50] what this is supposed to be it's not
[46:52] might in your thoughts it's his
[46:54] do we come into that one accord
[46:58] under the influence of the holy ghost
[46:59] the holy ghost brought them in one
[47:00] accord
[47:01] they was fussing and fighting and
[47:02] arguing until the holy ghost come
[47:04] and it bring them all together right
[47:07] holding the word the message of the hour
