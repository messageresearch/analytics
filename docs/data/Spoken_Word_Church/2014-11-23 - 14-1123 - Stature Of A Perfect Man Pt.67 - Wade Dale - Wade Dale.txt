thank you we'll be leaving wednesday after service going against that so we'll be there but i'll be preaching for brother mike oh team but yeah i already talked to louise he's going to do it bro louise is at bernie williams he called me and wanted to come preach for him so that's where they're at so pray for them and terrorist elise is on their way to myrtle beach for a little r r so i think erin and sarah are going to to tennessee aaron and sarah are in tennessee so we've got a few out today but that's okay we always do yeah all right let's um i'll tell you what i want to do let's go to the book of ephesians and i want to read ephesians 4. let me get my other bible out over here ephesians 4. somebody took my bible i like that bottle there well thank you did everybody see that if you haven't if you have a is it just for ipad or is it for yeah okay it's a bible by tim carter it's really it's pretty neat i like to i like to read it because he puts pages all right let's go to ephesians 4. where are we going to start because i want to read a good bit of it let's go back to let's read the whole chapter ephesians 4 verse 1. paul says i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called all right with all lowliness and meekness with long suffering for bearing and you know we need to turn this on thank you okay plug this up too at least what does that vocation mean whatever you're called in like i'm a teacher i'm a teacher i'm not an evangelist and so don't i don't want to be an evangelist all right work hello work with you work will work i don't think you're talking about electronics though they don't work all the time i mean your job in the church your job in the church hello hello hello hello hello hello hello bench warmer whatever anyway yeah we got that okay rare warrior yep that's right that's your vocation what worthy of the vocation where with your call all right she called to do something brother brown said when brad realized who she is and what she's doing here well that's ephesians four verse one with all loneliness and meekness with long suffering for bearing one another in love so he's paul is probably uh by this time he's talked to peter he and peter have talked about the statue of a perfect man not it being the statue of a perfect man but talking about growth development because peter had it in second peter 1 or and then you see paul bringing it just a little different way and he basically tells you how you're going to get it peter tells you what to get everybody understand peter tells you what to give add to your faith virtual version of get the divine nature of god as this and that's this but now what paul says all right this is the way you're going to get it okay got it endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there is one body this is the body of christ all right this is the body one spirit even as you're called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all through all and bless his southern name in you all paul was a seller probably from albany yeah l.a no because he would have said y'all somewhere but until every one of us has given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ see what he's doing is measure measure this is measurement this is my measure your growth right we put the little lines on the wall in the end we got it in the bed in the bathroom we put a little head there and marked her growth one year and then mark it the next year and market well we we mark her growth well what does it look like it's marks it don't go that way she doesn't shrink she grows okay she's growing in a stature that's what we should be doing growing in a stature but until every one of us has given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now paul's fixing to interpolate because look at the parentheses now that he ascended what is it but he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he's filling in he's telling you that jesus went to hell right went to the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things now if you take that out take verse 9 out let's read it let's verse 8. wherefore he says when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and give gifts unto men and he gave some apostles some prophets there's the gifts that you're getting right but paul interpolate in verse 9 tells you that jesus went to hell went to heaven now he's come back down here right to give us gifts and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith this puts us in unity when we come to brotherly kindness that puts us into unity of the faith and of and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure see there's another measurement measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we hint forth what does henceforth mean now and going on henceforth means now and going on all right that we henceforth be no more children this is children down here this is babies all right toss to and fro and carry it about with every wind of doctrine we see that happening already by the slight of men now not the apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists that god has put gifts in the church it's one that man has put in the church all right carried about with everyone adopted by the slightest man and cunning craftiness whereby they lying wait to deceive that has nothing to do with this this is perfect that is the other side okay but speak the truth and love what these five folds but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is heavy in christ all right so paul is pointing to here he's pointing to the head that's the head right there divine love that's the headship that's the son of man ministry that was jesus christ fully walking on the earth all right may grow up into him there's another measurement grow up into him and all things which is the head even christ for whom the whole body fitly joined together now we're going to read that in just a minute because brother brown said the holy spirit comes down and what we call welding welding these things together all right what fitly joined together and compacted there's only one way you can compact something you beat it that's right squeeze it right pressure or squeeze it but to compact if we compact the ground to plant whatever we need to plant or put pavers down or anything even when they build a road you see any big roller graters they're full of water and they weigh thousands of pounds what are they doing they're compacting the earth so that when they pour that heavy concrete on it part of it doesn't sink down here and part of it stays up here that compaction pushes it down so so paul is really you know peter says paul says things hard to be understood peter was i mean paul was a little a little bit more in the word i guess than peter was because he's a prophet sure peter could be a minor prophet but paul was a major church age messenger prophet he was a pattern messenger so we had to know a little bit more than peter about this stature of a perfect man so he's staying fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supply the every joint right making okay but at whichever joint supply according to the effectual working in the measure there's another measurement in the measure of every part now when i start on this in january y'all don't lay out on me i want some amends up there in the in the sanctuary don't you fall asleep because you're going to hear this over again but maybe in a little different form making look measure of every part making increase what is increase it's a measurement volume okay increase making increase of the body into the edifying of itself in love because you got to edify the body first the body must be edified first before you go out and give it to somebody else because if you can't you know if we can't strive together and and you know talk about our you know it's like i always said you you family you know fights in the backyard between each other but don't fight my brother and sister in the front yard okay because you got to deal with me we may fight in the backyard but don't fight me and go fight my family in the front yard so the same way with here we may have little things among us that we got to get worked out but we better stand true because you know this is the only family we really got is this family here into the edifying of itself in love so the edification's got to come from here and flow out right this i say therefore and testify in the lord that you henceforth there it is from here and from here and beyond walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind the world okay in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darken now he's bringing it back in where paul's talking about one day he talks about grievous wolves coming in the book of acts because and he said and among you now say he knew they were among him then that brother knew there was people among him among his group that didn't believe what he said having the understanding darkened being being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them you have a choice but remember ignorance once truth is presented to you it's not ignorance anymore it turns into iniquity and there's no sacrifice for that except come back to the truth there is an ignorance offering in the old testament if you ignorantly done something which means you don't know okay if you've ignorantly done something then there was a sacrifice there but when you do it willfully having the knowledge of the truth see paul brings that out again he's if you do things willfully now having a knowledge of the truth there's no sacrifice for that you got to repent you got to come back to god even you can't just keep walking or you're just not part of the body of christ having the understanding darken being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart there's your cause because of the blindness and not your heart your soul that's right the blindness of your soul all right who being past who being past feeling have given themselves over until lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness now that don't have nothing to do with here this is cleanness this is not selfishness all right uncleanness and greediness which is taking them out but ye have not so learned christ if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus that you put off concerning the former conversation of the old man all right this is in the conversation of the old man when you get born again okay that you put off concerning the former conversation of the old man which is corrupt so there ain't nothing good about us anyway that's right none good no not one that's right if y'all remember wednesday night or sunday brother they were ready to quote and i've got it pinned that i'm going to use and i wish i'd used it at the minister's meeting brother branson you were born with a sinful soul and questions and answers he said you somebody said explain body spirit and soul he said no you were born with a sinful soul so why can't we just realize that we were born wrong we were born wrong everything about us was wrong there was were totally contrary totally alienated from the commonwealth of god paul said all right but they put off concerning the former conversation of the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and i don't mean just lush for the body that means lust of all things that's right okay and be renewed in the spirit of your mind you're still in that statue of a perfect man because if you're not being renewed in your mind which is working right into that soul that's where that comes from remember that works from the inside out yes okay where for what i'm sorry and bet you i'm sorry 24 and that you put on the new man which is that which after god is created all right you don't get a new soul remember created means make a new remember we looked in genesis 1 26 god created man well he couldn't have created that man so that man is eternal he formed or fashioned or brought it into view so you can see it all right so he's doing the same thing which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness so now the buddy that's that's up there all right godliness and true holy see how paul's walking you right through the statue of perfect ma'am wherefore putting away lying speaking every man truth with his neighbor remember what was the second greatest commandment besides love the lord thy god with all thy heart second one love thy neighbor as thyself and brother brown said that was that brother kindness all right wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another all right be ye angry and sin not watch how he puts all that in there be angry and sin not he throws that in there let not the sun go down upon your wrath jesus was angry i don't believe he was mad there's a difference in mad and angry right big difference in mad and angry yes do you this is a stupid question but did jesus apologize to those people he chased out of the temple because it says that the sunshine could not go down here and he didn't do that no i don't think he did well he said unto though at the cross he kind of laid everything out when he said father forgive him you know he in his in his soul in his soul which was almighty god he had to look at them as a just god which was judgment they were doing something it's kind of like when he walked up to the woman at the when they throwed her down remember with the woman that was caught in the act of adultery right right but remember if jesus had seen the act if he would have went with those people and seen the act of that woman committing adultery he would have had to stone her first because he was the priest he would have to stone her but what did he do he told him he said okay any of you got no sin that's the first time so they all left he said woman where are your accusers well jesus was standing there yeah woman where are your accusers she said i have none in other words he's saying well i didn't see you do it either i didn't see you do it where's your witnesses so it's just me and you standing here i'm a man and you're a woman i'll forgive you for sins and that's what god does to all of us right because remember he doesn't see our sin remember he doesn't see our sins he hears our voice through the blood right he hears our voice through the blood and that was that whole scenario that that was because see the world's gonna condemn you you're gonna be standing there in judgment one day and you know you're gonna do something wrong to somebody and they're gonna look up there and they're gonna see you standing there in white doing the judging and you're they're going to go i did you know in other words that what's he doing standing up there and i'm doing that here because he did something to me and jesus is going to say well he asked me for forgiveness and you did that's going to be just as simple as that i mean he's just going to be it's just going to be so simple so that's what the woman the woman standing there in the act of adultery we're all an adulterer we were born from an adulterous act so we were all committed we were just like that woman we were caught in the act of adultery and the world was standing around her that saw her do it but she couldn't commit adultery about herself no no but let's stay with this story huh yeah so we all committed spiritual adultery let's put it that way because we you might all could not committed natural adultery just being born between your mom and your daddy you're born an adulterer you're born in sin shaping an iniquity a spouse from your mother's womb a liar you know we were all born dead and we're caught in the act because if jesus brother brown said if jesus don't look through the blood he'll kill you too because of this thing that's right see because of this he'll have to kill you because this is contrary to god that's why flesh and blood this flesh and blood that he sees if he was to see it through the blood he'd have to destroy this because it's contrary to anything he ever had to begin with this is permissive well but he had to put that layer of blood like brother branham brother brown wanted to condemn that old woman for being a prostitute and jesus said come here from come here man chris let me walk behind the door for a minute i'll show you something yours is just as bad as her there ain't no big center louisiana you know so he went back with a different attitude same way with the woman then that was caught in the act of adultery we all were caught in the act but he didn't see us do it that's what we got to realize that's the true justification that you never did it to start with the real you and what you know in in let me interpret that's what god's saying god is saying had you not have fallen had you not have come here in a fallen condition that holy ghost that's inside of you would have never done that see so that's what he looks at he looks at that genesis what genesis one man you got to follow him down if you follow him down right we are sinless because of that not because of this but because of what's inside of us that's where the sinlessness starts because listen god won't dwell in an unclean vessel but the very day you get born again and still have issues and problems and all these things that you don't have god says i'm pleased to dwell in that person right there that's what he said that's right on river jordan he said i'm pleased to dwell in that now it's not here you him but i'm pleased to dwell in that vessel right there with all of our inadequacies and all the things that we do wrong he's pleased to dwell because that's where he wanted to dwell to begin with something just hit me when you say that that's how important asking for forgiveness is that's true because just by the act of us asking for forgiveness he was he's pleased to dwell in us right and brother adam said the reason david was a man after god's own right was that he repented right you read what on the psalms there he's just a very repentant man but see if david would have had the holy ghost here we go back to the example if david would have had the indwelling of the new birth right there's a lot of things in there he would have done but that wasn't there yet but see god was still looking at him through the blood had to be looking at him through the blood but remember there's a literal time that you and i have to come down here and we have to prove that that's right because he forgave us before the foundation of the world i mean everybody says that and that's okay well you were forgiven before you asked but you gotta ask that's right but you gotta ask you can't just go through life and say well i was forgiven for it even started so i don't have to you know that's not the right attitude that's right yeah no you you need to ask forgiveness that's what baptists say yeah i was forgiven yeah well i didn't want saved always saying right once saved always that's kind of people in the message let's come to a message church you'll be fine don't worry about it once they always say i believe that if it's true if it's true you always were saved but baby let me tell you something like i told them preachers that weekend i said when you was down on that floor slobbering and crying and snotting all over the place asking god forgive me your sins you went laying there going well i always was eternal i knew that you know i just come to this realization didn't i and that's what i told him with it that's what i told him preachers i said you know what i said snot and i said y'all laying around the floor snotting and crying and spitting and crying out to god i said you weren't laying down on the floor going well bless god i always was then i always was eternal that's right i said no he's crying out for forgiveness why were you crying out for forgiveness because he's a sinner now you read see the problem with people now is i realize that now though that i always was eternal what i have if i'm born again i have what i have always was eternal what came to me that day always was eternal but they had to come to a day that i realized that and look back and the more grace i see now is just to look back and see how god had his hand in everything that's more precious believe in the other right exactly grace it's common sense it's grace yeah well right with creatures you say common sense yes i got in trouble telling them that remember i told them i said you need to lay your quotes aside lay your computers aside and just listen for a minute well they interpreted that i said were supposed to do away with all the quotes and not didn't it ain't what i said but it's what but it's what is what they interpreted that i said they just don't want to listen because most of them it's like you said they have itchineers and they want to refute everything you say but anyway that's okay verse 23 and be renewed in the spirit of your mind let's finish this before we go and as you put on the new man which which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness wherefore putting away lying speaking every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one or the other one of another be angry and sin not let not the sun go down on your wrath neither give place to the devil all right let him that stole steal no more kind of simple isn't it don't get down and say 25 hail marys and you know that's what the catholic church does no but rather let him labor working with his hands the things which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth now you can take that naturally or you can take that spiritually you need to work with your spiritual hands so if somebody needs some of this right hair some of this virtue you got it to give to them because you've already done your work you've already done your work because this is the work of the holy ghost this is the work of holy ghost right so you've done your work which is good that he may have to give them that needed peter says silver and gold have none right that's exactly what that is talking about let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers all right and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption not until unto i said journey unto the day of redemption all right because you can grieve the holy spirit brother brown said you'll grieve him he'll go on a limb sit there and wait on you he's not gonna go out on a tree and sit and wait on you that's just an analogy that's just an example what he does is the holy ghost who says hey you're not acting good i'm not gonna i'm not gonna i'm not gonna help you with that kind of attitude but when you get rid of that just call on your daddy call on your father and he'll come back okay but just as simple as that that's why david said return unto me the joy of salvation david would be anointed in the spirit he would feel just wonderful oh god would just anoint him just like a river and then all of a sudden where are you lord you know like jesus on the cross he said what why is that forsaking me one the anointing had lifted off of him that had been on him the whole time and grieve not the holy spirit of god for by your seal unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tender hearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake have forgiven you that happens right up to right here you don't ever stop asking forgiveness you don't ever stop needing forgiveness even right here you have to watch what you're doing and let god do the work tell anybody any questions i don't have a question i just have i just wanted to tell everybody last sunday cindy and i have been in a battle for months now since she's been staying with us and i've been in the battle mostly in jenna when you said we need to find ourselves in that pyramid where we are right right well it came to me that i'm stuck with tempers and patients remember i told you that was a two rough one this week has been a wonderful week just having the knowledge of that where i was um we've been great cindy can tell you i haven't been angry one time we've had it we've had a wonderful week she's doing better wonderful you know and uh our household has pics and we got to know where we're at you've got to know where you're at if you're going to travel up this pyramid you've got we as human beings got have to know why do we have google earth why do we have all these things why do we have gps's right we want to know where we're at sure it's it's tough being lost you know i wish they'd use a man's voice on those gps instead of a woman i kind of changed it kind of hard for me to do what a woman tells me to do especially in a car shirt he said you can change it i know you can and follow directions too yeah it doesn't matter what the voice is you know you gotta follow the direction or not you know i jumped in i jumped in the car one day and and joseph canada don't let him ever fool your gps he turned mine to it on this chinese one was going no no i looked at that gps and timbo with timbo was working with me he wouldn't die he was rolling in the floor laughing because he knew that joe had gone into our truck and he changed that gps to where it was speaking and she also told me she said tell me something yeah but we have to be chasing
