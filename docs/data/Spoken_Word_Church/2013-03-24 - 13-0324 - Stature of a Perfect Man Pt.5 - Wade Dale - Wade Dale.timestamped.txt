[0:08] now we're talking on the statue of a
[0:10] perfect man and that's what sunday's
[0:11] could have been for the past four times
[0:13] four sundays and this will be number
[0:16] five and we're still just on the
[0:18] foundation of faith all right
[0:22] and we haven't got out of that because
[0:27] just in a
[0:28] review there's one thing we got to
[0:31] understand
[0:33] as the bride of jesus christ we got to
[0:35] realize one
[0:37] we were lost
[0:39] we didn't just come in the message and
[0:41] get saved right
[0:42] right you don't just come in the message
[0:44] and it's an automatic process no you
[0:46] this is the worst place to be if you're
[0:47] not right all right so
[0:50] and that this here is anti-word this out
[0:53] here
[0:54] because it was born against the word the
[0:56] word was not the word did not make this
[0:58] flesh
[0:59] my mom and daddy made this flesh
[1:01] okay
[1:02] jesus was the word made flesh
[1:05] difference right okay
[1:07] he was without sin you and i were born
[1:09] anti-word totally against the way the
[1:11] word was supposed to be all right right
[1:14] so
[1:14] and that doesn't that that doesn't it's
[1:17] like brother branham said it it's a bad
[1:18] thing
[1:19] but god didn't leave us there that's
[1:21] right
[1:23] he wanted to redeem us
[1:25] he don't want us to try to redeem
[1:27] ourselves
[1:28] okay
[1:29] so we're born anti-word well even when
[1:32] we're born again
[1:34] we have
[1:35] the death of the old nature
[1:37] not the old soul dies we're not into the
[1:39] two soul thing
[1:42] but the nature of that soul was burned
[1:44] out just like the earth brother around
[1:46] him in the future homie really
[1:48] if you'll read the future home to me i'd
[1:50] rather somebody read the future home to
[1:52] get a little understanding than to read
[1:54] any other book
[1:55] because he goes all the way through it
[1:57] starts with a journey of a christian and
[1:58] goes all the way through because
[1:59] remember
[2:01] you and i
[2:02] god in isaiah 40 said that this world
[2:04] was made and it was made to be inhabited
[2:07] now when god says that that's eternal
[2:10] so he's going to have some eternal
[2:12] people living on the earth
[2:14] and you and i come out of that earth
[2:15] which was cursed in the garden
[2:18] god didn't curse adam
[2:20] he cursed the ground that he came out
[2:21] from so everything that was in the earth
[2:24] was cursed
[2:26] that's why cain's sacrifice couldn't be
[2:28] accepted it came from the earth it was
[2:30] cursed it was the cursed earth
[2:32] so
[2:33] but then
[2:34] remember christ come to make a way back
[2:38] we're buried in corruption
[2:41] anti-word
[2:43] raised in incorruption
[2:45] now you and i are dead in christ already
[2:47] by the new birth inside
[2:49] so we are going to make manifest inside
[2:52] but now
[2:53] memory reason conscious effects and
[2:55] imagination
[2:58] that's not born again
[3:00] that's not born again
[3:02] you still have evil thoughts
[3:05] yeah that's right we have your memory of
[3:07] the old things you used to do
[3:10] so let's just get on through memory
[3:12] reason conscious face and imagination
[3:13] all those things we love things we
[3:16] shouldn't love that's right
[3:18] okay
[3:19] so that is a carnal nature still of man
[3:22] but now god made a provision brother
[3:24] brown said almost verbatim he said
[3:25] somehow
[3:27] god comes down through that preach it
[3:29] brother
[3:34] you talking to me
[3:36] but somehow god comes down through all
[3:38] that and gives you the new birth well
[3:39] then what happens brother branham
[3:41] preached what thinking man's filter
[3:44] the filter the flues got stopped up
[3:47] adam didn't have a problem talking to
[3:49] god
[3:50] until his flush got stopped up
[3:53] now that's what we got to come back to
[3:55] is the restoration of you and i being
[3:57] able to talk to god face to face without
[3:59] condemnation
[4:01] all right that's what we've got to come
[4:02] back to
[4:04] that's the part that we
[4:05] that we are we fell from
[4:08] and that's the part that we got to come
[4:10] back to
[4:11] everybody understand that yes that's
[4:12] very simple basic you must be born again
[4:15] but brother adam takes the earth and he
[4:17] says now the bible says it's a new
[4:19] heaven and a new earth
[4:22] right
[4:23] old things are passed away
[4:25] you bring it to this all things have
[4:26] become new that doesn't mean that you
[4:28] physically
[4:30] die and god brings a new person
[4:34] you're you when you were born and you
[4:35] were given a body spirit and a soul
[4:38] that's a unit
[4:40] god doesn't separate that he doesn't but
[4:42] like brother brown said i don't believe
[4:44] in transmigration of souls in other
[4:45] words put assault your soul over
[4:47] somewhere else
[4:48] no when you die your soul goes in the
[4:50] sixth dimension your body goes to the
[4:52] grave spirit goes back to god who gave
[4:53] it
[4:54] everybody understand that
[4:56] so i'm trying to delay this foundation
[4:58] of faith because we got to realize
[5:00] number one that we are
[5:02] we have still a carnal nature
[5:06] come on people you see these
[5:08] babies yes we do
[5:10] that's proof enough
[5:12] we're still living in a carnal nature
[5:14] that's not god's perfect will but that's
[5:16] his permissive will to procreate
[5:19] okay but that wasn't his perfect will
[5:21] his perfect will was spoken word
[5:23] children just like you and i
[5:27] can i finish my fault okay just because
[5:29] you and i were one day you know this
[5:31] sunday school class only had about six
[5:33] people in it at one time
[5:36] this church only had about 15 people in
[5:38] it at one time that's right
[5:39] well now
[5:41] freedom central was probably one of the
[5:43] youngest ones to come she where was she
[5:45] 20 years ago where was she 15 years ago
[5:47] or was she three years ago
[5:49] i'm just using for an example
[5:51] she wasn't here
[5:53] there was a time when joshua dale was
[5:55] not here
[5:56] he was in me
[5:58] but he wasn't here where we can see
[6:01] because he was wasn't fully manifested
[6:04] all right so then here comes freedom she
[6:06] appears
[6:09] spiritual multiplication
[6:10] right
[6:12] brother dale
[6:13] is preaching the spiritual
[6:16] seed word of the god of god light was
[6:18] supposed to have happened and then we as
[6:20] children now being born of god on the
[6:23] inside
[6:24] are sealed
[6:26] done just like we said
[6:29] just like we said last week we were
[6:31] talking about the city about living in
[6:32] the city and outside the city if you're
[6:34] born again if you were born again this
[6:36] morning and you die in a car wreck going
[6:37] home you're just as eternal as almighty
[6:40] god
[6:42] because one speck of eternal life is
[6:44] eternal life
[6:45] okay the ocean is huge one little
[6:48] tablespoon
[6:50] has got everything in it that that ocean
[6:52] you can say you've got all of the oceans
[6:54] potentially that's right potentially
[6:57] that's why in ephesians it said you have
[6:58] the earnest of your inheritance because
[7:01] the full inheritance is not this thing
[7:02] being
[7:03] corrupt
[7:04] full inheritance is this thing back to
[7:06] like the garden of eden where you can
[7:08] talk to god face to face right okay now
[7:10] what's your question
[7:11] or comment yeah i happen to think
[7:15] this will never be saved our flesh what
[7:17] will happen for us to take that rapture
[7:20] is it that the faith in us will
[7:23] quicken this that's right
[7:25] romans 8 says the spirit that raised up
[7:28] jesus from the dead if it dwell in you
[7:30] that would be word if right that it will
[7:32] also quicken your mortal body
[7:35] by his spirit that dwells in you see not
[7:38] everybody is not going to be quickened
[7:39] at the resurrection no
[7:42] this is not going to be a general
[7:43] resurrection coming up
[7:44] this is going to be a secret you're not
[7:46] going to walk out there and your brother
[7:48] tatum and sister tatum's laying side by
[7:50] side up here in lula
[7:52] the rapture takes place well if you go
[7:54] see it you missed it
[7:55] but if somebody wants to walk up and go
[7:57] well they're still in the grave that's
[7:59] why it's going to be a secret carrying
[8:00] away god don't have to dig the graves up
[8:02] to get the bodies out
[8:04] he just takes that soul that can walk
[8:06] through a wall
[8:08] the real person of robert tatum huh
[8:12] the real person of jesus christ remember
[8:14] he walked through walls and he even
[8:16] still had he had his flesh body he was
[8:18] glorified
[8:19] but brother tatum's soul is going to
[8:20] come back and pick up that body coming
[8:22] right back up out of the grave
[8:25] right
[8:26] and it's not going to disturb one little
[8:28] dust of of earth
[8:30] so it's not going to be the the
[8:31] resurrection that's what a lot of
[8:32] denominational people think you're going
[8:34] to walk out there in that whole hillside
[8:36] it's going to be like
[8:37] blossomed you know like
[8:39] caskets sticking up like
[8:41] no that's kind of macabre that's kind of
[8:42] like the world thinks of zombies you
[8:45] know here they come out of the ground
[8:46] you know
[8:48] you see this zombie thing there's a
[8:50] meaning behind that
[8:52] i'll get to that one day and i'll tell
[8:54] you what that means what the horse
[8:56] showed me that man let's see you in the
[8:57] office you're alive do i see you in the
[9:00] office working and you're alive and
[9:01] that's when they're right
[9:03] you're just gonna disappear
[9:08] now how about somebody like retro with
[9:09] the baby you should just leave the face
[9:12] baby go baby go
[9:15] all babies go to heaven
[9:17] and i do not believe that god would let
[9:19] that baby stay here or
[9:23] are you
[9:25] see they've got three kids i mean my
[9:27] what would be a god that would take the
[9:28] two parents and leave the three kids in
[9:30] an empty house that's right
[9:32] no
[9:33] they're going with you right but now
[9:34] when they come to age accountability 12
[9:36] 13 14 and they got to make their
[9:38] decision if they don't yeah they are
[9:40] going to stay here i was listening to
[9:42] questions and answers yesterday going to
[9:43] work brother brown they had that
[9:44] question said will my children be saved
[9:47] brother brown said if they're born again
[9:48] he said if they're not they won't
[9:50] he said that's just the way it is
[9:53] you can believe for your children and
[9:55] believe for your children and have faith
[9:57] for your children and i believe if you
[9:58] have real substance faith
[10:01] somehow they'll come
[10:03] it may be a deathbed confession
[10:07] you may never know it but that's fine
[10:09] ten seconds one second split second god
[10:12] saved my soul
[10:13] done
[10:14] right
[10:15] right right
[10:16] absolutely so so you know let's look at
[10:20] this as
[10:21] as a growth process as you and i mature
[10:24] up the statue of a perfect man but we
[10:26] all got to start as babies in christ
[10:27] that's right
[10:29] babbling babies romans 8 says we seem to
[10:32] receive the spirit of adoption will we
[10:34] cry father father out by father what
[10:37] we're going to wobble around we're going
[10:38] to stumble we're going to fall
[10:40] but remember what we said
[10:43] that little baby back there that brother
[10:45] louise little zoe she she's got
[10:47] everything she needs to drive a car
[10:49] right
[10:50] she will develop nothing else
[10:53] as far as externally she'll nothing else
[10:55] she's got everything she needs she might
[10:56] need a couple of uh stacks of papers to
[10:59] sit on to see over the steering wheel
[11:02] but she's got every faculty but brother
[11:04] louise is definitely if he does we're
[11:06] leaving
[11:07] hands her the keys today and says here
[11:08] zoey drive us home
[11:11] but potentially she can as she matures
[11:15] in god that's right
[11:18] in other words she's not have to grow
[11:19] another arm she doesn't have to grow
[11:20] another leg she just has to get some
[11:22] intelligence right
[11:24] knowledge temperance patience
[11:26] guidelines
[11:28] temperance we need we're still driving
[11:29] cars and we still need temperatures
[11:32] brother ray you should have plenty of
[11:33] temperatures because you don't drive
[11:38] pray for your
[11:40] wife that's what we're looking at here i
[11:43] want us to understand that that we're
[11:45] just not
[11:46] revelated just because we're in the
[11:48] seventh church age and we're revelated
[11:50] because we're up there where it says
[11:51] brotherly kindness
[11:53] we all start as babies right here
[11:56] faith
[11:58] it's a big old wide foundation
[12:00] that's why there's a lot to be said
[12:02] about it
[12:04] but you got to have number one a desire
[12:06] to want god brother brown said remember
[12:08] last sunday we read this
[12:10] um
[12:11] the quote before this
[12:13] where he's talking about pulling his
[12:14] wife inside of him you know he said
[12:15] that's the way we should be with christ
[12:17] we should want him so much that and then
[12:19] he continues on that he says that's the
[12:21] way it is with christ we've got to be so
[12:23] in love with him to when we ask for
[12:24] something and he doesn't give it to us
[12:26] that doesn't shake us a bit
[12:28] he didn't say a little bit he said a bit
[12:31] they don't shake you at all when you say
[12:33] god
[12:34] i got so-and-so and so-and-so
[12:37] just keeps quiet
[12:39] now zoe when she's a baby and she cries
[12:41] or eula we jump everybody
[12:44] we want to know what's wrong with that
[12:45] baby give it something give it something
[12:47] but now when that baby grows up to be
[12:48] about 10 years old and they still sit in
[12:50] a corner and cry because of nothing
[12:53] grow up kid
[12:55] i'll give you something to cry about and
[12:57] then we'll know what you're crying about
[12:59] okay
[13:02] um
[13:03] when when we see that the
[13:05] dead saints raised and among us
[13:09] would would the
[13:11] um
[13:12] the spiritual things that we have
[13:13] problems with be
[13:15] over
[13:17] well let me quote you what brother brown
[13:19] said he said until the change this is
[13:21] going to be sticky
[13:23] this is going to be sticky until the
[13:24] moment of the change now
[13:26] now kind of getting off the subject we
[13:27] need to get back down to baby faith but
[13:30] let me let me help you with this
[13:33] when those dead saints come out of the
[13:34] ground
[13:35] we're going to be right here
[13:39] a novice is not going to call the dead
[13:41] saints out of the ground that's right
[13:44] brother brown brought us the headstone
[13:45] message and this is headstone which is
[13:47] christ
[13:48] he's the only one he is
[13:51] we are not so big to where we say we're
[13:53] the resurrection but what we say out
[13:55] from us
[13:57] jesus said i am the resurrection and the
[13:59] life well there's not a number two
[14:00] resurrection he said i am
[14:02] but that i am is going to be so much in
[14:05] us here because we got these things
[14:07] working in our life
[14:08] so when we call the dead saints out of
[14:10] the ground you think it's going to
[14:11] bother us
[14:14] because i don't think like brodel i
[14:15] believe the same way when the dead
[14:17] saints come out of the ground you got 30
[14:18] 40 days
[14:20] bible says it didn't cross your eyes
[14:22] first
[14:23] and we which are alive and remain
[14:26] shall be
[14:27] changed
[14:28] and caught up and meet the lord in the
[14:30] air all right so the dead saints are
[14:31] going to come out of the ground first
[14:32] we're going to call them out by the
[14:34] message that we preach
[14:36] speak the position that we reach that's
[14:39] why i've always said this is not just
[14:41] believing the message there are steps to
[14:43] take and that's why
[14:45] if you'll look in ii kings
[14:48] when elijah was on mount carmel now
[14:50] there was the what that was the second
[14:51] coming of elijah
[14:53] we believe we saw the fourth coming of
[14:54] elijah right so it's the same spirit
[14:57] you take the second coming of elijah he
[14:59] goes to mount carmel and those false
[15:02] prophets preachers
[15:05] they get on top of the altar and by the
[15:07] time they're finished with it it's all
[15:08] tore down
[15:10] the bible says elijah builds the altar
[15:13] back
[15:14] that's what brother brown come to do he
[15:16] came to restore
[15:18] not bring us a different message he came
[15:20] to restore the message it was the
[15:22] original message
[15:24] and then once we got to that level or
[15:27] getting to that level
[15:29] he calmly preached the seals brought
[15:31] christ down to where we can unite with
[15:33] him
[15:35] okay so that is a process
[15:37] elijah had to put the altar back
[15:39] together
[15:40] then he poured water on it then he
[15:42] called god down
[15:45] he wasn't going to call the altar he
[15:46] wasn't going to call god down with the
[15:47] altar being all messed up that's right
[15:49] so he had to restore church order he had
[15:51] to restore our lives back to the
[15:53] position of the
[15:54] faith of the fathers down here the first
[15:56] church age at ephesus okay
[15:59] that's what we got to be restored back
[16:00] to
[16:01] don't don't start screaming we've got
[16:03] rapture and faith and we're here no
[16:05] that's baby faith
[16:07] that's just faith to say god i accept
[16:10] you as my savior
[16:11] and i want you to burn all the old me
[16:14] out and you come in
[16:16] and you're still going to make mistakes
[16:18] you're still going to do things wrong
[16:20] but you're not going to do like we've
[16:22] always said
[16:23] now at sanctification see that's down
[16:25] here before you even get faith that's
[16:26] right
[16:28] all right so the the cussing drinking
[16:30] smoking running around lying cheating oh
[16:33] sure we're all born liars which i wise
[16:34] every day if you don't tell it exactly
[16:37] the truth it's a lie that's right
[16:39] all right
[16:40] but down here at sanctification all that
[16:43] should already been gone that's not
[16:44] that's not talking god's going to burn
[16:46] it out at faith
[16:48] now he's starting a process to burn it
[16:50] out in sanctification
[16:52] water blood
[16:54] life
[16:54] all right water blood life then god
[16:58] starts right back over
[17:00] and you can still go
[17:01] to justification and sanctification is
[17:03] this higher walk brother brown said
[17:05] there's a higher form a mysterious part
[17:08] of justification that luther didn't know
[17:11] luther had just enough faith to get him
[17:12] right here
[17:15] smoked a pipe drank a beer
[17:17] sat in a pub but that was god
[17:20] because it was god on the inside
[17:22] he wasn't he was trying to work his way
[17:24] to the outside
[17:25] but he couldn't get outside because of
[17:26] man's traditions remember the capsule i
[17:28] told you about there's a lot of good
[17:30] medicine inside that capsule that's
[17:31] right but once you you got to put that
[17:33] capsule in an environment to dissolve
[17:35] and get out to do you any good all right
[17:37] so that's the same way god
[17:39] god didn't limit himself man limits god
[17:42] god never limits himself we limit what
[17:45] he can do for us and actually the same
[17:47] thing brother brown says
[17:48] on down a little bit further and we
[17:50] won't get to it today but he says we
[17:52] limit these things in other words not a
[17:54] verbal quote but he's saying
[17:56] we are the ones like daddy said hey he's
[17:58] been hitting this he did it last sunday
[18:01] you have nothing to do with god choosing
[18:03] you
[18:05] but once he chooses you
[18:07] your works is your faith expressed
[18:10] once he does choose you
[18:12] he's not going to lose you
[18:14] but if you can't if you can't get rid of
[18:16] that temper and you're going to keep it
[18:18] bless god i've just got it and that's
[18:20] the way it's going to be that's where
[18:21] you're going to stay and you're going to
[18:23] have to be purged by dying that's right
[18:28] these two things purges you the words
[18:29] while you're standing here are death
[18:31] because the bible says you're
[18:34] planted
[18:36] we planted brother tatum in corruption
[18:39] yeah his body was corrupt you could look
[18:41] at it
[18:42] he was 80 years old
[18:45] not in good shape but that soul of that
[18:47] man
[18:48] is over there protected in that sixth
[18:50] dimension waiting for a time
[18:53] to come back and pick up that body we
[18:55] don't believe they get a new body they
[18:56] get that body made new
[18:58] because we don't believe in and god's
[19:00] going to destroy the earth and then
[19:01] bring a whole new earth you know
[19:03] he's going to bring that body back out
[19:04] of the ground
[19:06] quicken it
[19:08] make it new
[19:09] and we're going to see him walk that's
[19:10] why we got these pictures out here
[19:12] our brother tatum and sister tatum at 20
[19:14] years old
[19:16] brother and sister bush at 20 years old
[19:18] the ones that we've got this past on 20
[19:20] years old
[19:22] got 15 minutes that's a 15-minute bail
[19:25] and uh we're going to see them in their
[19:28] youth because remember we planted them
[19:30] in corruption because their body did not
[19:33] come to a place
[19:35] of purity
[19:36] are perfection
[19:38] all right
[19:39] but now when they raise
[19:42] what are they going to raise in
[19:44] incorruption
[19:46] this soul is going to come and pick up
[19:48] the body
[19:50] bring it out of the ground
[19:51] we're going to stand and end corruption
[19:54] let's just be real honest
[19:57] jesus body was corruptable i said
[19:59] corrupt the ball
[20:02] it was corruptable
[20:04] because he was born in this satan's
[20:06] domain when he come out of the womb he
[20:08] was perfect he was not he was not born
[20:10] of sex he was not born in sin shaping an
[20:13] iniquity like you and i were but when he
[20:15] hit this environment of satan
[20:18] his body because he looked 50 and he was
[20:20] only 30.
[20:22] what did the scripture say i'm not
[20:23] leaving my servant soul in hell or his
[20:26] body see
[20:27] corruption that's why he had to
[20:28] resurrect within three days
[20:30] or the cells would have started popping
[20:32] and he would started corrupting
[20:35] okay
[20:36] so he resurrected
[20:38] to show us
[20:40] it can be done right then he walks
[20:42] through the wall with that body
[20:45] and he eats fish and honeycomb
[20:51] right
[20:53] fishing honeycomb that's what he ate and
[20:54] it didn't fall through the floor it went
[20:56] into something he had substance in other
[20:58] words
[20:59] faith is the substance of things hoped
[21:00] for he had a substance body
[21:02] that could walk through that wall yet
[21:04] they could touch him
[21:05] thomas touched him right put his hand in
[21:07] his side the wound was open put his hand
[21:09] in that side right he was he
[21:12] okay so that's what we're going to be
[21:14] when we resurrect but we've got to come
[21:15] to a place everybody's not going to come
[21:17] to that place
[21:20] sorry ain't going to happen
[21:23] it's only going to look how narrow it is
[21:25] up here
[21:27] there's only a few going to reach this
[21:28] headstone position where they can call
[21:30] the dead out of the ground it's going to
[21:31] be very few
[21:33] when brother brown said i doubt 12 in
[21:34] georgia i believe he meant 12 to stand
[21:37] at the chains
[21:39] not just 12 people it's going to make
[21:40] the rapture
[21:41] 12 people stand to make the change okay
[21:46] but we've got the first half look let's
[21:49] read this
[21:50] we've got to be so in love with him so
[21:51] when we ask for something and he doesn't
[21:54] give it to us that doesn't shake us a
[21:55] bit why and the only way you can do that
[21:59] is become partakers of his divine nature
[22:01] then you'll understand the reason
[22:04] he can't give it to you
[22:06] remember i've always said god's nose are
[22:08] the best yeses you ever get
[22:10] because if he says no he knows that if
[22:11] he says yes this is what you'll do but
[22:13] if he says no you'll do this for the
[22:15] glory of god all right
[22:18] and look here having escaped the
[22:20] corruption that is in the world through
[22:21] lust escaped it
[22:23] see who it is who see who it's too is to
[22:25] the church
[22:27] them who are in christ has been exalted
[22:29] above these things
[22:31] not he exalted himself
[22:34] brother brown said you can naturally
[22:35] have these virtues
[22:37] but somewhere along the way god's going
[22:39] to test them and if you fail what'd he
[22:40] say you got to go back down
[22:44] anybody ever remember the old
[22:47] game called shoots and letters
[22:50] that's what reminds me of the statue of
[22:52] a perfect man
[22:53] because you get i mean you had the
[22:54] shoots and ladders you go down and shoot
[22:55] or you start up that ladder and somebody
[22:57] knock you off or you you'd get the wrong
[23:00] number and you'd have to go back down
[23:01] well that's to me
[23:02] because remember jacob's ladder what
[23:05] jacob's ladder to me has too many
[23:06] jacob's ladder looks like one it looks
[23:08] like this it's a ladder that goes to
[23:10] heaven and it's got steps on it
[23:13] and also remember me talking about it
[23:15] being uh it's just dna strain
[23:17] what does a dna strain look like it
[23:19] looks like a ladder
[23:21] it's got steps in between it and that's
[23:23] what you are and that's what jacob saw
[23:24] he saw angels
[23:27] ascending
[23:28] and descending not descending and uh
[23:30] standing they were already here
[23:32] so they were ascending and descending
[23:34] all right and that ladder to me is a
[23:36] statue of a perfect man now jacob didn't
[23:38] go up that ladder but you and i can
[23:40] because you know what the word was there
[23:42] for everybody to go up that statue of a
[23:44] perfect man but it took a profit
[23:46] to put the rocks back in order
[23:48] rock means what
[23:49] revelation
[23:50] he had to put the revelation back in
[23:52] order
[23:54] to bring us to christ
[23:56] a true prophet points you straight to
[23:58] christ not to himself
[24:00] that's what he done he pointed us to
[24:01] christ so that we could commune with him
[24:03] not with novel eliezer
[24:06] it wasn't ellie either isaac and rebecca
[24:08] in the bed chamber
[24:10] three's the crowd
[24:12] but ellie easier told her so much of him
[24:16] so when she saw him she'd never seen him
[24:18] in his life in her life we've never
[24:20] physically seen jesus christ in our life
[24:22] but brother brown said he'd become so
[24:23] visible among us what through the
[24:25] message that that man preached to us
[24:28] he brought he didn't bring christ down
[24:30] we did because remember revelations 10 1
[24:33] through 7
[24:35] read verse 8 and 9.
[24:39] john is the type of you and i right
[24:41] all right
[24:42] john did not take the book from
[24:44] revelations 10 7
[24:47] he didn't take it from that angel
[24:49] he took it from the mighty angels
[24:52] now now now
[24:54] elijah had to turn us to christ
[24:58] right
[24:59] but john took the book from the one that
[25:00] had his foot on the landing on the sea
[25:02] now that wasn't william brown
[25:04] that was christ that he preached to us
[25:06] so visible
[25:08] until we took the book from christ but
[25:10] if you take a book from william brown
[25:14] you're lost
[25:17] you're lost if you just take the book
[25:19] and say william brown was my prophet and
[25:21] he got it
[25:22] and i just got to believe what he said
[25:24] that's not that's not it people
[25:26] he pointed us straight to christ now if
[25:28] you go to christ
[25:30] you're going to turn and see the message
[25:31] of the hour that's right you can't help
[25:33] it
[25:34] right
[25:35] seed life comes through the body you
[25:36] can't get born out there like daddy said
[25:38] they're dead now my brother brown said
[25:39] they were lodges sorry folks
[25:42] they have these great big campaigns they
[25:44] can heal sick raise the dead
[25:46] but if they're still father-son holy
[25:48] ghost baptism and they're still
[25:50] doing what they're doing they're dead
[25:53] they're dead while they're living
[25:55] you can't go convert
[25:57] a baptist church anymore because it's a
[25:59] lodge brother brown called them lodges
[26:01] that's all they'll be
[26:03] bible called them dead birds
[26:05] right
[26:08] on the point of willing running
[26:10] uh brother brown said if you put a full
[26:13] stop
[26:14] a period you call it period here that's
[26:16] where you organize that's right it's a
[26:18] comma it's whatever the pentecostals had
[26:21] what william brown
[26:25] that's right
[26:26] because what's going to happen is
[26:32] the bible said false prophets and false
[26:34] christs would come now brother brown's
[26:36] dead he's gone
[26:37] his voice is over as far as his voice
[26:40] but the voice is in the bride
[26:43] but where's the false prophets gonna
[26:45] come from
[26:46] they're not gonna come from baptists
[26:48] because their faults already
[26:55] i'm sorry brother brown said it i didn't
[26:57] they're dead so they're right here
[26:58] they're dead there's no way they can
[27:00] come up to be bribed unless they accept
[27:03] the word of the hour that's what he said
[27:05] now the baptist had the word of the hour
[27:07] and when they had the word of the hour
[27:08] when they first started
[27:10] they had the word of the hour they were
[27:12] bribed true
[27:14] right
[27:16] luther wesley
[27:18] but now when they denominated like she
[27:20] said and put a period
[27:22] they died well now when they died and
[27:24] didn't accept no more of that and they
[27:25] accepted creeds and this this and that
[27:27] and the other
[27:28] they died and that when you die there's
[27:31] only one way to resurrect
[27:32] that's when we go back to what we said
[27:34] if the spirit of him that raised up
[27:35] jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll
[27:37] quicken your mortal body if it's not in
[27:38] there you're going to stay in the ground
[27:40] that's right all the way through the
[27:42] tribulation through the millennium white
[27:44] throne judgment you're going to come
[27:47] okay yeah so everybody will go okay with
[27:50] that as far as the foundation the mighty
[27:52] angel came down
[27:54] brother branham explained why he was
[27:56] here that's to my knowledge to bring all
[27:59] of it together he explained why christ
[28:02] was here and who he was
[28:04] because john the mighty angel says let's
[28:07] read that let's read it let's just read
[28:08] it that way it'll
[28:10] take all your uh
[28:12] take all your worries away right here
[28:16] excuse me
[28:17] revelation 10 7
[28:21] and in the days of the voice of the
[28:22] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[28:23] sound the mystery is only one mystery
[28:27] of god should be finished as he has
[28:28] declared to his servants the prophets
[28:30] never look at number eight and the voice
[28:32] which i heard from heaven spake unto me
[28:34] again saying go and take the little book
[28:36] which is open
[28:38] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[28:40] upon the sea and upon the earth
[28:42] he didn't take it from the seventh angel
[28:44] messenger's hand
[28:46] the seventh angel messenger is to bring
[28:48] the mystery of god to a completion
[28:51] amen
[28:53] right
[28:54] he's supposed to bring the mystery box
[28:55] and then we're supposed to take the open
[28:57] book right
[29:00] we're supposed to take the open book
[29:01] from christ
[29:03] if we just get a knowledge of this
[29:04] message or a knowledge i was telling him
[29:06] last night i had a knowledge at 14 years
[29:09] old that brother brian was a prophet and
[29:11] that this was right and it was sex in
[29:13] the garden and there's no eternal i had
[29:15] a knowledge of that
[29:16] and you know what that knowledge was
[29:18] right
[29:19] but i wasn't born again
[29:21] that was just my outside man agreeing
[29:24] like brother ryan said he said baptism
[29:26] he said that's just plain he said you
[29:28] don't need a revelation right
[29:30] but see the real revelation is to
[29:31] realize that you john
[29:34] have to take that book
[29:37] and it didn't say excuse me it did not
[29:38] say that john left some pages laying on
[29:40] the floor
[29:42] right because sometimes we
[29:45] a lot of that's just too much to eat
[29:46] there
[29:48] and that's just a little too much to eat
[29:50] there and
[29:51] i don't think i'll eat that i don't
[29:54] really enjoy that that's true
[29:56] right
[29:58] john took the whole book
[30:00] and it disappeared
[30:02] but it disappeared and became john
[30:06] come on
[30:07] and you never see that book again until
[30:09] the white throne judgment and who's
[30:10] there the books open again
[30:13] which is you and i god's not got a great
[30:15] big dusty book and he's going to
[30:18] and start flipping through the now he's
[30:20] going to say wesley step forward bring
[30:22] your people
[30:23] you judge these people here wesley you
[30:25] bring your people you judge your people
[30:27] pentecostal you come you judge your
[30:29] people what we're in the book
[30:32] we're in the book
[30:33] you don't see that book anymore sure it
[30:35] speaks of the book but you never see
[30:37] this book open until revelations 19 and
[30:39] 20 when we're standing at the white
[30:41] throne judgment and then what's open not
[30:42] a book you that's right
[30:45] you go through walmart god's gonna
[30:47] ladies gonna say god you never ever came
[30:50] by my path
[30:52] he'll have about three or four sisters
[30:54] or three or four brothers come out and
[30:55] they'll he'll say i sent you four
[30:57] witnesses
[30:59] i didn't see one i sent you four
[31:02] and you denied every one of them so as
[31:03] you deny them you deny me right
[31:06] same way with the reverse of that
[31:09] sister christine driving down the road
[31:12] she has a flat tire
[31:14] a guy comes by and just don't know her
[31:16] from nobody just shows her an act of
[31:19] kindness now he may be a drunk a thief a
[31:21] liar and he may have ten wives
[31:24] never darken the door of a church
[31:28] but when that book is open
[31:32] when that book's open it's going to be
[31:33] written in there
[31:35] that that man showed kindness to that
[31:37] system yes
[31:39] and jesus that man knows
[31:43] the environment he's standing in he
[31:44] knows he's gone because he doesn't have
[31:47] the same spirit
[31:48] because he's being judged
[31:50] but what a what a god yes
[31:53] yes sister thing she sold it
[31:55] she taught more last night i've ever
[31:56] heard her talk in her life
[32:00] but that's good
[32:02] that means she can
[32:04] but she's standing in the back and she's
[32:05] this little squirrely voice little girl
[32:07] and there's millions of people standing
[32:08] out there and god's getting ready to
[32:10] pass judgment on that man because that
[32:12] that man don't know who the christ is
[32:14] yeah
[32:15] and christine's going to excuse me lord
[32:17] yes
[32:17] lord
[32:19] lord
[32:20] and he'll hear her
[32:21] he'll say step forward she'll say lord
[32:23] don't you remember
[32:25] this man one rainy night train come on
[32:27] top
[32:30] yes
[32:31] and you said yes
[32:33] that a cup of water in my mind will
[32:35] never be forgotten over this side
[32:37] or on that side that's right
[32:39] what a great thing to say sir
[32:41] because of this sister
[32:43] enter into the joy of the lord
[32:45] so it works both ways
[32:47] but we are witness and that's what this
[32:49] is it's revelation 10 7 it's in the days
[32:51] of the voice it's what is what you and i
[32:53] are saying now now it can't be different
[32:55] than what the prophet said
[32:56] don't let's don't get wrong on that
[32:58] we've got to say what he said
[33:00] he said you say what's on tape and you
[33:02] say what's in these books because
[33:04] wrapped in faith lays in there right
[33:06] okay so long we say that and stay in
[33:08] scripture then we're fine so we're
[33:10] building i want us i want this to build
[33:12] our faith to where we can say either
[33:13] well i know i'm born again or i know i'm
[33:16] lost one of the two okay
[33:19] you know you lost then we can we can you
[33:21] know you can work your way up through
[33:23] here
[33:24] potentially
[33:26] right
[33:27] in sanctification
[33:29] you can get part of it
[33:31] because you got to have some virtue you
[33:32] got to have some knowledge and
[33:33] temperaments and patience you have parts
[33:35] of it all right
[33:36] so what i'm not hallelujah
[33:39] praise the lord get all them kids are
[33:40] screaming
[33:44] but remember to be considered to have
[33:46] the divine right here
[33:49] partakers of his divine nature
[33:52] you wasn't born with his divine nature
[33:54] sorry that's right
[33:57] you were born with the nature of your
[33:58] mom and daddy and the world
[34:01] and that was what was molded
[34:03] but when you become partakers of his
[34:05] divine nature you've escaped the
[34:07] corruption that is in the world through
[34:09] lust so in other words you get a free
[34:10] ride to glory
[34:12] but god doesn't want us just to stay
[34:14] babies right yeah i love deanna like she
[34:16] is but i don't want her to stay that way
[34:17] i wanted to grow up
[34:20] i wanted to be have a full life well
[34:21] that's what this is you're just baby
[34:24] faith is just
[34:25] really inside of you it's like brother
[34:27] brown says it's like a button
[34:29] just a little dot that god wants to
[34:30] start working on
[34:32] he's still working on me then what's
[34:34] going to happen
[34:39] but it's not but now wait a minute i
[34:41] can't control my temper
[34:43] okay then you shut him off right there
[34:47] and you can't control your temper
[34:49] but when you just lay it in god's hand
[34:51] that's why that's why i say it's the
[34:52] birth of the word it's a god's going to
