[3:46] because my loved ones are coming in i
[3:47] don't know about yours
[3:49] but during that jubilee that we've been

[3:54] we're not going out of here
[3:56] if we're in our jubilee we're not going
[3:58] out of here with our kids with us
[3:59] amen but they got to have an experience
[4:01] they're not going on your tail
[4:03] your hotel they're going to go on your
[4:04] experience i mean their
[4:06] own experience with god but you know

[4:13] know they can have one
[4:14] and man they can have an experience it's
[4:16] freda got her hand up too i believe that
[4:18] so let's uh bow our heads just remember
[4:21] these requests and all the ones oh
[4:22] also i know most of you don't know but i
[4:24] don't know if dad and mom knows it but
[4:26] brother uh david nunley's twin brother
[4:29] daniel passed away
[4:31] uh not of covet i don't think but he
[4:33] passed away he goes brother donny's
[4:34] church also
[4:36] just remember that family we knew
[4:37] brother david really well
[4:39] and then brother daniel went to brother
[4:40] donny's church and they were twins and
[4:42] brother david died several years ago and
[4:45] but he passed away
[4:46] either last night or sometime so just
[4:48] remember that family and prayer
[4:50] i'd like to thank sister gwen and
[4:51] brother joe and their family for
[4:53] allowing us to do the service and me and
[4:55] brother dale had a really good time
[4:57] there we thought
[4:59] um a lot of sister maggie and we thank
[5:02] all of you for your prayers and the
[5:04] cards and what you sent for food
[5:06] it was just an outpouring which which we
[5:08] appreciate we're humans
[5:10] we need affection we need we need
[5:12] closeness
[5:14] and if it has to come from a church
[5:15] family then i think we're the only
[5:17] people know how to love
[5:19] we're supposed to right we're the only
[5:21] people know how to love
[5:22] that love out there past these doors is
[5:24] a lot like the scripture we're talking
[5:25] about lust
[5:26] right but we know true love agape love
[5:29] comes from the bride of jesus christ so
[5:31] let's bow our heads
[5:32] the heavenly father thank you for this
[5:34] day that you give us
[5:36] we pray now that as we open your word
[5:38] lord that you'll open our hearts to
[5:39] understand it
[5:41] lord you said that for us to
[5:47] lord be an empty vessel for us to empty
[5:51] ourselves out from the things of the
[5:52] world and the cares of life just for a
[5:54] few moments
[5:56] and lord please speak to the people lord
[5:59] because that's more important than
[6:00] anything is that the people get
[6:03] something today
[6:04] and the brothers and sisters lord will
[6:06] become stronger
[6:08] by listening to what you're saying to
[6:10] them lord we pray that you'd heal the
[6:12] sick lord
[6:13] raise our immune system lord to take
[6:16] care of this virus lord
[6:18] we know that every day that naturally
[6:20] happens in our body there's something
[6:22] always attacking these human bodies
[6:25] and you gave us a mechanism inside of
[6:27] our body lord
[6:28] to protect and you also gave us lord the
[6:31] new birth
[6:33] lord to be able to listen to what you
[6:35] said you said you would never leave us
[6:36] or forsake us so in our darkest hour
[6:38] lord we know you're there with us
[6:40] lord be with the ones that are not here
[6:42] the ones that are sick the ones that
[6:43] have traveled and come back thank you
[6:45] for getting them back safe
[6:46] father we pray that you just sanctify us
[6:48] for this journey that we're on
[6:50] bless our pastor lord and keep him
[6:51] strong safe
[6:53] and bless each one lord that's in this
[6:55] building today father just give us a
[6:56] special blessing today in jesus name we
[6:58] ask him
[7:00] amen so now we've been on eternal
[7:02] redemption
[7:04] and for those of you that are that have
[7:06] come in the middle of it i'm going to
[7:08] try to background real quick
[7:10] but let's go to hebrews 9 verse 11.
[7:13] everything that we as christians look at
[7:15] is based on redemption
[7:17] because we're all lost we didn't come
[7:20] here
[7:21] not needing redemption everybody needed
[7:23] redemption
[7:24] even the animals even the earth needs
[7:27] redemption
[7:28] all right it's because of the fall
[7:29] that's why it's called a fall
[7:31] something fell all right so when man
[7:34] fell
[7:35] everything below man fell and we needed
[7:37] redemption and then we've been talking
[7:39] about
[7:40] resurrection because if we don't base
[7:44] what we have on somebody resurrecting
[7:46] and bringing us a message and coming
[7:49] inside of us
[7:50] then we're a man most miserable the
[7:53] scripture tells us
[7:54] so we got to depend on redemption
[7:58] but it's based on resurrection amen and
[8:01] we're going to read that in just a few
[8:02] minutes and then we'll try to continue
[8:04] on
[8:05] with the two witnesses so but christ
[8:07] being coming high priest of good things
[8:08] to come
[8:09] by greater more perfect tabernacle not
[8:11] made with hands
[8:12] that is to say not of this building
[8:14] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[8:16] but by his own blood he entered him once
[8:18] into the holy place look
[8:19] having obtained eternal redemption now
[8:22] remember he
[8:22] came to this earth not needing
[8:25] redemption
[8:26] amen he was god he didn't need to be
[8:29] saved
[8:30] he came to save us but he had a human
[8:33] body that needed
[8:34] to be made eternal so he acquired
[8:37] eternal redemption for us here
[8:40] when he rose and said all power in
[8:42] heaven there's given unto me
[8:43] there's that glorified body that we were
[8:45] talking about the other night so let's
[8:47] go to amos 3 verse 7.
[8:49] i know this is familiar but
[8:52] several of the ministers have been
[8:53] reading it so i'm going to read it again
[8:56] surely the lord will do say that word
[8:59] with me surely the lord will do
[9:02] so he's not going to do anything but he
[9:04] reveals
[9:05] his secret unto his servants the
[9:07] prophets we needed a
[9:09] prophetic voice in every age
[9:13] israel needed it in the old testament we
[9:15] need it in the new testament
[9:17] we needed it in every church age and god
[9:20] sent it to us
[9:21] amen the lion hath roared who will not
[9:24] fear
[9:24] the lord has spoken who can but prophesy
[9:27] all right let's read revelations 11
[9:28] 3 because when this redemption of the
[9:31] gentiles is over
[9:33] the redemption of israel begins and that
[9:35] what we were talking about last sunday
[9:37] or wednesday night there's two witnesses
[9:39] that's going to go to jerusalem
[9:40] and they're going to preach this same
[9:42] message of redemption
[9:44] and resurrection to 144 000 that's going
[9:48] to accept it
[9:49] so revelations 11 3 and i will give
[9:52] power to my two witnesses
[9:53] and they shall prophesy one thousand two
[9:55] hundred and three score days which is
[9:56] twelve hundred sixty days
[9:58] clothed in sackcloth and read one more
[10:00] before we sit down
[10:01] revelations one verse 20. the mystery of
[10:05] the seven stars which i saw us in my
[10:07] right hand
[10:08] and the seven golden candlesticks now
[10:10] there are seven stars which is in whose
[10:12] hand
[10:12] god's hand not man's hand
[10:16] it's in god's hand so there's seven
[10:18] stars and then we read you where
[10:20] the um the definition of star is what a
[10:23] messenger from god not just a messenger
[10:25] a messenger from god
[10:27] all right so a messenger from god came
[10:29] seven times
[10:30] in seven church ages because look the
[10:32] seven stars i'm reading bible i'm not
[10:34] quoting from a man
[10:36] i'm quoting from jesus christ all right
[10:38] the seven stars are the angels of the
[10:41] seven
[10:41] churches now what in seven church
[10:43] buildings said in the world
[10:45] churches are people churches are not
[10:47] buildings churches are people
[10:49] then we know that the prophet of god
[10:51] come in the end time and he told us the
[10:52] difference between a church
[10:54] and a bride and maybe we'll get to that
[10:57] this afternoon where
[10:58] you got the church and then you got the
[10:59] bride all right and the seven
[11:01] candlesticks which thou saw us
[11:03] are the seven churches you may be seated
[11:05] in the lord as blessing
[11:07] for reading the word for those of you
[11:08] coming in if you don't want to
[11:11] you got to skeet over just a little bit
[11:13] and let
[11:14] unless unless sterling needs to sit on
[11:16] the front row
[11:19] he's ducked down in the back good to
[11:21] have him and
[11:23] sister cali with us today amen pray for
[11:26] them they finna get married
[11:29] that's exciting man that's exciting
[11:33] all right so now we know the seven stars
[11:36] are the angels
[11:37] so god sent us seven messengers or seven
[11:40] messengers from god
[11:42] to seven different church ages separate
[11:44] seven
[11:45] different dispensations according to the
[11:47] bible
[11:49] so like i said before we have contention
[11:52] maybe in the world that thinks that well
[11:55] you know god didn't send william branham
[11:57] he i don't know where
[11:58] you know he's wrong and he's this and
[11:59] he's that and whatever they want to say
[12:02] that's fine with me because it doesn't
[12:03] bother me at all
[12:05] my resolve is is that god had to send me
[12:07] a one of those stars
[12:09] because we're in the last church age so
[12:11] he had to send me a star behold i will
[12:13] send
[12:14] you elijah the prophet before the great
[12:16] and dreadful day of the lord
[12:18] so if william branham is not him i can
[12:21] hold god
[12:22] to his word amen and say if you didn't
[12:25] send me if it wasn't him
[12:26] you got to send me somebody because you
[12:29] said you would
[12:30] one of the seven stars amen
[12:34] matthew 17 verse 10 let's go there
[12:38] and after the disciples it's kind of
[12:40] neat to have to move people over and sit
[12:42] down
[12:43] and his disciples ask him saying why
[12:45] then say the scribes that he lies or
[12:47] elijah
[12:48] must first come listen the old testament
[12:52] the last book of the old testament was
[12:54] what malachi
[12:56] there is no new testament to the jews
[12:58] they don't believe in the new testament
[13:00] because they'd have to believe in jesus
[13:02] christ so they believe the old testament
[13:04] the old testament prophets which was
[13:07] which was the last one was malachi and
[13:10] malachi says
[13:11] we'll read it in a second but jesus
[13:12] answered and said elish truly shall
[13:14] first come
[13:15] and restore all things
[13:19] not bring us something new restore all
[13:21] things back to where it was before
[13:25] so now let's read malachi 4. behold i
[13:27] will send you
[13:28] elijah the prophet before the coming of
[13:30] the great and dreadful day of the lord
[13:32] you say well that was john the
[13:33] john the baptist it wasn't the coming of
[13:35] the great and dreadful day of the lord
[13:36] he was introducing the messiah
[13:39] he was an introducer he was the one
[13:40] standing between the old testament and
[13:42] the new testament
[13:43] and we know he turned to heart now look
[13:45] and he shall turn the heart
[13:47] of the fathers to the children john
[13:49] stood and was preaching to those
[13:51] old rabbis those old orthodox jews those
[13:54] old priests in the old testament
[13:55] that did their sacrament not sacrament
[13:58] but did there
[13:58] did there one two three go to the temple
[14:01] don't do anything on saturday do this
[14:02] don't do that don't touch the women
[14:04] don't look at this don't do that you
[14:06] understand so john was introducing the
[14:08] messiah to them
[14:10] hey look this is the messiah this is the
[14:12] one that's going to take you not destroy
[14:14] the law
[14:14] but make sure that you can live it and
[14:16] live it right because when
[14:18] when the lawgiver came
[14:21] he looked right down in their soul and
[14:22] he said you're not living it anyway
[14:25] you're you you love the prophets and
[14:27] you're the one who put them in
[14:28] in the tomb isaiah
[14:32] i've been reading in isaiah this week
[14:33] and
[14:35] and it's the commentary of the whole
[14:36] bible but you think about isaiah
[14:38] a young man they tore him into pieces
[14:44] cut him up and threw him away just like
[14:46] he was nothing
[14:48] because of what he said he was a young
[14:50] man trying to do what god said
[14:52] and who did it it wasn't the heathens
[14:55] people of israel got mad at what he said
[14:58] have you ever heard that before
[15:00] and left the church oh and it got mad
[15:02] and uh
[15:03] and they killed him in the old testament
[15:05] now they just
[15:06] people just leave and kill you with
[15:08] their influence so anyway
[15:10] so he shall turn the heart of the
[15:11] fathers to the children so here stands
[15:13] john the baptist he's taken the old
[15:14] testament
[15:15] and he's introducing that old testament
[15:17] the old
[15:18] into the new testament behold the lamb
[15:20] of god and takes away the sin of the
[15:22] world
[15:22] then what john leaves then
[15:26] the very one that john introduced in
[15:28] matthew 17 verse 10 said elish truly
[15:30] shall first come
[15:32] and restore all things now john the
[15:33] baptist didn't restore all things
[15:36] this malachi 4 messenger supposed to
[15:38] restore all things so he wasn't talking
[15:39] about john the baptist he was talking
[15:40] about the elijah to come so there's an
[15:42] elijah to come
[15:45] so we have to contend he's either
[15:47] already come and give us a message
[15:49] or he's going to come in somebody else
[15:52] but we need that person here
[15:54] to what time the loose ends
[15:58] i mean my heavens look at all the
[15:59] denominations that we have in the world
[16:01] with all the different ideas there's
[16:02] thousands of different ideas
[16:04] god's not that confused he gave us one
[16:06] bible
[16:08] he sent us one messenger in the end time
[16:10] and then what did that messenger do
[16:12] he didn't introduce the world to himself
[16:15] he did just like
[16:16] john the character of elijah he
[16:18] introduced us to christ
[16:21] because remember back in these church
[16:23] ages man took a hold of some of this
[16:26] now not the seven stars that was the
[16:29] message for the
[16:30] for their day but men got involved in it
[16:33] with men's ideas and as men's ideas got
[16:37] involved denominations became up
[16:40] remember when peter and james and john
[16:42] and all them would
[16:44] when paul traveled to ephesus and smyrna
[16:46] he didn't pass a baptist church in the
[16:48] methodist church in the pentecostal
[16:49] church and the presbyterian church
[16:51] they weren't there now they were little
[16:53] ideas and little sayings maybe that were
[16:55] coming up
[16:56] but most of it what paul was doing was
[16:58] he was giving them what
[16:59] the foundation of the gospel
[17:03] and so this messenger of malachi 4
[17:07] is going to turn read the rest of that
[17:09] and and the heart of the children
[17:12] to the fathers so anyway in other words
[17:14] we were a bunch of babbling baby
[17:15] children pentecostal babies
[17:17] they just thought everything as long as
[17:18] you spoke in tongues it didn't make no
[17:20] difference
[17:21] long as you didn't have you didn't have
[17:22] to have a preacher you could just sing
[17:24] you didn't have to have a preacher you
[17:25] could just somebody stand up by
[17:26] inspiration
[17:27] no it took an elijah to come in the end
[17:29] time and say look you need to have a
[17:30] church service
[17:32] you need to have offering taken up
[17:34] special songs you need to have
[17:36] bible reading you need to have a couple
[17:37] of songs and bring the preacher out
[17:40] and let one preacher preach not a bunch
[17:42] of people so see that's him restoring
[17:44] taking the children what does children
[17:47] need children need guidance
[17:50] without guidance oh my goodness
[17:54] without guidance what would we be we'd
[17:57] be a bunch of children running around
[17:58] somebody jumping out speaking in tongues
[18:00] this one jumping up so i got a sermon
[18:01] today
[18:03] women and men both it happens in other
[18:07] denominations
[18:09] but they're wrong according to the bible
[18:12] that's wrong
[18:14] so what what had to come and tell us
[18:15] this malachi 4
[18:17] that turned the hearts of the children
[18:19] us a bunch of crying babies
[18:20] back to what the faith of the fathers
[18:23] where there's no denomination where you
[18:24] didn't believe
[18:26] eternal hell where you didn't believe
[18:29] father son holy ghost was a baptism
[18:31] that's what they believe out there the
[18:34] whole world's deceived by that
[18:38] because it's not in the bible you say oh
[18:41] yeah about father son
[18:42] yeah it is in the bible but listen
[18:44] father's not a name
[18:46] son is not a name holy ghost is not a
[18:49] name
[18:49] i think the bible told us that all the
[18:51] family in heaven was named what
[18:54] jesus christ and he said i come in my
[18:56] father's name
[18:57] father's not a name the lord jesus
[19:00] christ is the only name god ever had
[19:02] jesus and why shouldn't we baptize in
[19:05] that to connect us to him
[19:08] instead of baptizing the way the world
[19:11] tells you to baptize and the way the
[19:13] world tells you that hell is eternal
[19:15] if hell's eternal then there's eternal
[19:17] people down there
[19:18] and where there's eternal people that's
[19:20] where god is
[19:22] because satan's not eternal so whatever
[19:25] the place was created for the devil and
[19:27] his angel it's going to pass away
[19:29] but now how many people in denominations
[19:31] today will actually fight you physically
[19:35] why because you're tearing down their
[19:36] foundation you're tearing down their
[19:38] doctrine
[19:39] that man has given them god has not
[19:42] given them that doctrine
[19:44] all right there is not three gods behold
[19:46] israel thy lord thy god
[19:48] is one and we believe in one true and
[19:51] living god amen
[19:54] so now let's look at the chart we've
[19:56] been on the
[19:58] this has been 28 sermons on the uh
[20:00] eternal plan of redemption so
[20:03] paul we're slow down here okay you
[20:04] people in minnesota talk faster than we
[20:06] do
[20:06] of course i talk pretty fast for being
[20:08] for being old southern boy
[20:10] there we go all right can you uh
[20:13] for us older ones can you make it a
[20:15] little bit bigger
[20:18] so we went through all this yeah right
[20:20] hallelujah you see you said hallelujah
[20:23] so we're here where christ went to hell
[20:25] preached to the sinners
[20:27] that was already dead that's good we're
[20:29] good
[20:30] he was here for 30 or 40 days then he
[20:33] ascended
[20:34] all right this is bible all right he
[20:37] ascended
[20:38] acts 1 3 first through 11. and then he
[20:41] said
[20:43] tarry until you be indu with power from
[20:45] on high which is acts 2 verse 1.
[20:48] so god came back now as
[20:52] the son of god the new birth
[20:55] to enter into you now he would walk with
[20:57] you as the son of man
[20:59] all right and i'm sorry folks this is
[21:01] for the this is for the
[21:02] the ones that haven't been here so they
[21:03] can get caught up i want to see what's
[21:05] going on so
[21:06] you know just don't take a nap
[21:12] but but just hit pause
[21:15] okay so ten days later in acts two verse
[21:20] one
[21:21] he said go your way be endued with power
[21:23] from on high he said i'll send the
[21:26] comforter which is the holy ghost in my
[21:28] name
[21:30] so yeah the holy ghost has got a name
[21:31] it's lord jesus christ but once it
[21:33] enters into
[21:34] you it's yours
[21:38] and you become mrs lord jesus christ you
[21:41] become god made flesh in another form
[21:43] called a bride
[21:44] or a son and daughter of gods everybody
[21:46] got that say amen
[21:48] all right so that's what happened we
[21:49] were promised that the new birth would
[21:51] come
[21:52] then john goes on the isle of patmos in
[21:55] 1896
[21:57] and god shows him a gentile church age
[22:02] amen because remember we studied this
[22:04] before jesus went to who first he went
[22:06] to the jews
[22:07] yes he came to his own john 1 he came to
[22:10] his own and his own received
[22:12] him not in other words they rejected him
[22:14] they kicked him out
[22:15] right but as many that would receive
[22:19] he gave power to be sons and daughters
[22:21] of god so that's the gentiles
[22:22] and jesus met many gentiles there's many
[22:25] gentiles in the old testament
[22:26] rahab different ones that you see there
[22:30] ruth
[22:32] just for two for an example that's the
[22:33] type of me and you that's the type of
[22:35] being out in the world
[22:36] and then we accepting that we accept
[22:39] god's what redemptive plan
[22:42] because ruth accepted boaz's redemptive
[22:45] plan
[22:46] amen but you had naomi there which naomi
[22:49] was the title boaz
[22:51] ruth was not ruth was the time
[22:55] that come together but naomi was the jew
[22:59] right and she had the near kinsmen
[23:02] ruth did not but ruth accepted naomi
[23:05] being the daughter-in-law
[23:11] she accepted and then what did what did
[23:14] her
[23:14] mother-in-law do guided her
[23:18] to boaz
[23:21] guided her to boaz because naomi c
[23:24] couldn't have boaz
[23:27] but ruth could if if
[23:30] f she was accepted
[23:33] by christ i mean boys
[23:36] amen he she said go to this well what's
[23:39] the old testament
[23:40] go do this don't do that go into his
[23:42] field stay there go lay down at his feet
[23:45] who was telling her this naomi
[23:48] the old jewish lady sorry the old jewish
[23:50] lady
[23:51] the old testament right was telling ruth
[23:55] the new testament girl the moabitess the
[23:59] the
[23:59] out scour of the earth because more by
[24:02] more bites came from lot and his two
[24:04] daughters have an incest so i mean
[24:06] brother brown said there was a hair and
[24:07] a biscuit all right so it was kind of
[24:09] gaggy thing he said but you know what
[24:12] i don't think it bothered boaz
[24:16] because he wasn't looking at naomi he
[24:18] was looking at roof
[24:21] he knew though that to get to ruth he'd
[24:24] have to go through naomi
[24:26] to get to the bride he'd have to go
[24:29] through that old testament
[24:31] because they rejected him in the old
[24:32] testament as bride
[24:34] as husband but he knew that somebody
[24:37] would accept him
[24:38] right amen in the church ages then we
[24:40] see and then we look in daniel 70 weeks
[24:42] we may look a little bit later on
[24:44] that interjected into this great gospel
[24:47] because look
[24:49] just hang on for a minute
[24:53] gentile gentile 2000 years
[24:56] then back to jew then the millennium
[25:00] is not to us it's to the jews
[25:03] we're there on a honeymoon ruth and boaz
[25:05] went on a honeymoon
[25:07] amen but he's going to be there
[25:12] in the millennium doing what ruling the
[25:14] 12 tribes of israel we're not going to
[25:16] be
[25:16] we're not going to be there being ruled
[25:20] no we'll rule and reign on the earth for
[25:23] that thousand years brother brown said
[25:24] just be a honeymoon we'll just be there
[25:26] be able to travel like a thought if you
[25:29] want to go to mars
[25:30] just hang on a little while you don't
[25:31] have to pay 20 million dollars or
[25:33] whatever it is go to the moon now with
[25:34] them
[25:35] a bunch of billionaires you know what
[25:36] they ain't going to be around
[25:38] in the millennium they won't be no
[25:40] billionaires right
[25:42] nope we'll all be the same we'll own the
[25:45] world
[25:46] right amen and all the gold and
[25:48] everything else
[25:49] i mean what you know it's okay we're
[25:50] alive we're supposedly the outskirt of
[25:53] the earth because you know gentiles
[25:55] even jesus called us dogs
[26:00] because he was showing that that nation
[26:03] was an out scour that nation didn't see
[26:06] they had gods
[26:07] yes they have a god israel had a god but
[26:10] they turned him down once they turned
[26:12] him down he goes to the
[26:13] gentile and once he reveals himself
[26:16] through paul arenas martin columba
[26:19] lutheran wesley
[26:20] and brother branham then he knows that
[26:22] there's a bride that's going to become
[26:24] a wife because in revelation 19 we see
[26:27] that the wife
[26:28] has made herself ready is everybody with
[26:29] me amen
[26:33] so anyway according to revelations 1 2
[26:35] and 3 there is a church age
[26:38] that is bride now there there are jews
[26:40] sprinkled in there
[26:41] okay the 120 in the upper room they were
[26:44] all jews
[26:45] right but what did paul and peter do
[26:48] finally they said lo we turn to the
[26:50] gentiles because the jews were just
[26:53] they that was the persecution they
[26:55] weren't persecuted by the gentiles
[26:57] the gentiles opened their arms up and
[26:59] said hey
[27:00] come on in this is wonderful we've never
[27:02] heard this before
[27:03] we've had diana we've had all these gods
[27:06] that don't do us any good they just
[27:07] stand there and stare at us
[27:09] but you've got a living god and we want
[27:13] that and the jews are going he wasn't
[27:15] god
[27:16] we're waiting on our messiah right
[27:20] so is the church world done today all
[27:22] right
[27:23] exactly we're the only people that know
[27:26] this story
[27:31] how it begins and how it ends
[27:35] because we're a bride my bride knows
[27:38] a lot more about me than all you know
[27:40] about me bless your heart you all need
[27:42] to pray for him
[27:44] should anyway
[27:50] not saying anything else so we got a
[27:53] bride and then down to these church ages
[27:55] they've lived
[27:56] took a message passed away and god will
[27:59] send another messenger
[28:00] they would live that message they would
[28:02] they would build not churches
[28:04] buildings but they would build a bride
[28:06] body
[28:08] they had their message for the day and
[28:10] then they would pass away and as they
[28:11] were passing away
[28:13] a new one would raise up because a
[28:15] messenger comes at the end of the age so
[28:17] the messenger would come
[28:18] paul came at the end of pentecost to
[28:20] bring his message
[28:22] then at the ending of paul's message
[28:24] he's already gone he's already told him
[28:25] grievous wills are coming
[28:27] they're going to destroy my message
[28:29] they're going to tear me up
[28:30] but irenaeus picks up the thought of god
[28:32] and he brings a message to his people
[28:34] and then on down through
[28:35] till we get to the end time and god
[28:37] promised us a seventh star
[28:40] whether you believe it was william
[28:41] branham or not i do i rest my soul on
[28:43] that because
[28:45] he took me to god he took me out of that
[28:49] confusion that was called the world
[28:51] that this one believed this and this one
[28:52] believed that and this one believed this
[28:56] to the truth now when somebody brings
[28:59] you to the truth
[29:01] he's a true messenger from god how do
[29:03] you it's not his life it's not all the
[29:05] different things
[29:06] it's what he done he brought you to
[29:08] christ
[29:09] all right and he brought me to christ i
[29:11] don't care if he was hunting out there
[29:12] in january february march april or
[29:14] the cloud to me that doesn't matter
[29:17] but to the born again it's a vindication
[29:21] that he came because he didn't put
[29:24] brother branham's head in there
[29:26] christ's head came into that into that
[29:28] cloud all right
[29:30] and he already told us in right here in
[29:32] acts 1 verse 3
[29:34] them two angels said hey you saw him go
[29:36] up in a cloud
[29:37] that's right you're going to see him
[29:40] come back in the cloud
[29:42] but see ever but see then all the
[29:44] denominational world they're looking
[29:46] i was reading a commentary the other day
[29:47] and we'll get into that not today but
[29:49] later on
[29:49] i mean they're pushing everything as
[29:52] brother um
[29:53] mike ulti was talking about everything
[29:55] does start with a hope
[29:57] right right everything starts with a
[30:01] hope
[30:02] but you can't hope you got eternal life
[30:06] i hope when i get see that's another
[30:08] fallacy
[30:09] in the denominational world is that you
[30:11] got to go to the white throne judgment
[30:13] they believe according to what i read
[30:15] yesterday that you've got to go to the
[30:16] white throne judgment
[30:18] stand before the great white throne
[30:19] judgment and see if you got eternal life
[30:23] see if you got
[30:28] god's not that way folks if you're born
[30:31] again it's settled
[30:33] you don't go to the white throne
[30:34] judgment you do have a judgment
[30:36] of the things you've done maybe against
[30:38] the brother or against a sister that you
[30:39] don't make right here
[30:40] or something you did in your life that
[30:42] you didn't make right because some sins
[30:44] go before some go after
[30:46] all right brother dale's been preaching
[30:48] had already preached on that so we don't
[30:50] have to like i said before one of the
[30:51] greatest revelations you'll ever have
[30:54] is that if you're the bride of jesus
[30:56] christ yeah you may have a little minor
[30:58] tribulation but i'm not talking about
[30:59] the great tribulation
[31:01] you won't ever go through the great
[31:02] tribulation and you'll never have to
[31:04] stand before the white throne judgment
[31:06] see mo all all denominations see they're
[31:09] not even going to come up they're going
[31:10] to have to stay dead till
[31:12] the till i hope i get it
[31:15] you better know you got it and when you
[31:18] know you got it
[31:20] it puts you in a millennium you don't
[31:21] have to worry about all this other stuff
[31:24] why worry about two prophets they're not
[31:26] to you we've already had the one we need
[31:29] we all right not going to get into my
[31:31] notes so we'll just stay right here is
[31:33] that all right
[31:35] i always wonder why brother dale did
[31:36] that no no
[31:38] when you get talking about something and
[31:40] something gives you a line
[31:42] stay in it we'll get back to it
[31:45] so we're looking like i said before and
[31:47] we'll go back and read because i'm
[31:48] getting ahead of myself but while we got
[31:49] the chart up
[31:52] that there's a sixth dimension where the
[31:54] born-again believers go if they die so
[31:57] and and born-again believers don't die
[32:00] they just go to sleep and they move into
[32:02] another dimension
[32:03] the body stays here because it was born
[32:06] in sin shape and iniquity
[32:07] all right it hasn't been changed yet
[32:10] that's right
[32:11] and like i said before i read we'll read
[32:12] it in a little while this is corruptable
[32:15] but we're going to be raised
[32:16] incorruptible so that's another fallacy
[32:18] that they tell you in denominational
[32:19] world
[32:20] and half the people in the message that
[32:21] this body is worthless we're just going
[32:23] to get a brand new one
[32:24] no it's going to be this one made brand
[32:26] new amen because what jesus is an empty
[32:29] tomb
[32:30] the empty tomb shows that there was
[32:33] somebody mortal
[32:34] and now they're immortal
[32:37] they were corruptable and now they're
[32:40] made incorruptable
[32:42] so there won't be any missing pieces
[32:48] i like what a guy said i've been reading
[32:50] some books brother mike ulti gave me
[32:52] they're really nice
[32:52] and they're not message believers
[32:57] anyway but how could god create you
[33:01] from a germ from a little sperm and an
[33:04] egg
[33:05] give you life let you go through life
[33:10] accept his life get born again and then
[33:13] he can't find you at the end time
[33:17] if you have to pass away
[33:20] if he made you he can find you
[33:24] and he will find you he promised he
[33:26] would it doesn't matter if you go down
[33:28] the depths of the sea it doesn't matter
[33:29] what they do with you
[33:30] that's right god's got you right here
[33:33] even your body because he allowed your
[33:36] body to come
[33:37] how do you allow what is this this is
[33:40] all the design of god
[33:42] yes that's right brother this is the
[33:43] design of god that you got here
[33:46] and god gave you a soul and then by the
[33:49] new birth he transformed
[33:51] he didn't take that soul out and put
[33:52] another one in no he burnt that one you
[33:54] got out
[33:55] burnt the sin out of it just like he's
[33:57] going to do right here in the millennium
[33:59] he's going to burn it off not destroy it
[34:04] and then you're going to have a new
[34:05] heaven and a new earth
[34:08] not a new earth where you got to go get
[34:10] on another one no we're going i thought
[34:11] the bible said we're going to live right
[34:12] here
[34:13] didn't john say he saw the help saw the
[34:15] new city in revelations 20
[34:17] coming down where was john standing
[34:21] on earth he saw the city come down
[34:24] and you know what folks we got a long
[34:26] time we're looking for the future home
[34:27] but you know what that thing's
[34:28] way over here we still got a thousand
[34:31] years that's not our temple
[34:33] that's not our place to live that's our
[34:36] honeymoon
[34:38] usually you don't live where you have
[34:39] your honeymoon i said usually
[34:42] you go somewhere on a honeymoon then you
[34:44] come back to your regular home
[34:46] all right so that's what we're going to
[34:47] do we're going to go on a honeymoon then
[34:48] god's going to burn this thing off we're
[34:50] going to come right back down here on
[34:51] this earth
[34:52] and you know what because this earth has
[34:54] been changed
[34:55] amen all right so now
[34:58] i'll get to my quotes in just a second
[35:00] or my scriptures but the sixth dimension
[35:02] according to first thessalonians 4 16
[35:04] we're going to look at it
[35:05] that's the first resurrection that's all
[35:07] these saints that have died and went on
[35:10] because everybody's not going to
[35:11] resurrect in the first resurrection
[35:13] remember this is a secret catching away
[35:16] thief in the night
[35:18] the world's not going to know the
[35:20] devil's not going to have a clue
[35:22] because he'll have no part in the first
[35:25] resurrection
[35:27] only the born-again people
[35:33] so he's been revealed to the church
[35:35] agent we'll read it in just a second
[35:37] as we said the son of god see the
[35:40] physical
[35:41] body of god did not come back on the day
[35:45] of pentecost
[35:48] because he wanted a spiritual body to
[35:51] build on the earth
[35:53] which is me and you and you can't have
[35:55] two bodies on earth at the same time
[35:58] he's actually in he's actually in
[36:00] another dimension
[36:02] dimension number seven he's in the
[36:03] seventh dimension
[36:05] controlling everything but he's got his
[36:08] immortal body
[36:09] yes the bible tells us life and
[36:12] immortality has been
[36:13] brought to life through the gospel and
[36:14] there's only one king potentate
[36:16] the king of kings and lord of lords that
[36:17] has reached immortality
[36:19] he's standing in the seventh dimension
[36:21] that's why brother brown couldn't see
[36:22] him
[36:25] that was a position that god had come to
[36:28] that he came and got a
[36:30] body that wasn't eternal to begin with
[36:33] because yours isn't either
[36:36] amen he lived a life just like you live
[36:39] but when he resurrected he resurrected
[36:41] the glorified body because he's god
[36:43] and he had to be the first fruits the
[36:45] one to do that so he's in the seventh
[36:47] dimension and brother branham goes into
[36:49] the sixth dimension
[36:50] but his old body is still laying on the
[36:52] laying on the bed for those of you that
[36:54] know it or don't know it we had a
[36:55] prophet coming in time and he went in
[36:57] another dimension
[36:58] all right so he's looking back here so
[37:00] that body is what mortal
[37:02] he was in his theophany in the sixth
[37:04] dimension looking at the ones that had
[37:06] died and went on
[37:07] he said where's jesus what did angel say
[37:09] he's higher
[37:11] higher seventh dimension all right so
[37:14] he's in the seventh dimension standing
[37:15] there
[37:16] waiting on his bride body
[37:20] to develop on earth and as he waits on
[37:23] the bride body to develop on earth
[37:25] he has to bring the head the head's
[37:27] where the controlling factor is
[37:29] right he brings the headship back to the
[37:32] church which the denominations they
[37:34] reject headship because they don't
[37:36] have anything to do anything to do with
[37:37] the truth
[37:40] sorry i drove by the old church a few
[37:42] minutes ago
[37:44] there stood two guys outside with look
[37:46] like gym shorts on
[37:48] in church going to church so i mean it's
[37:50] just to them it's just like you go to
[37:51] it's like brother brown said you go to a
[37:53] lodge you go and meet and greet hello
[37:55] boys good to see you and
[37:58] anyway there's got to be some holiness
[38:00] involved
[38:01] all right there's got to be some
[38:03] sacrifice involved
[38:04] in this that we see that god gave us
[38:08] what he restored us back they wouldn't
[38:11] have done that in the first church age
[38:13] paul would have seen it about two times
[38:15] and he would have cut their head off
[38:17] not literally but you understand what
[38:19] i'm saying
[38:22] so first thessalonians we're going to
[38:23] read that in just a minute so you're
[38:25] going to see that the first resurrection
[38:26] brings this sixth dimension into here
[38:29] you and i down to the church ages
[38:34] we have been motivated
[38:38] as the prophet said as the son of god
[38:41] revelation which is god in the form of
[38:45] the holy ghost
[38:47] in the group of people called the bride
[38:50] all right everybody got that say amen a
[38:52] group of people called the bride that's
[38:54] the ones that have it not just
[38:56] not just had a good thought that's right
[38:59] we even went through justification and
[39:00] sanctification because we'll read it in
[39:02] just a little while
[39:03] about the foolish virgin they were
[39:05] foolish because they never got
[39:07] oil oil is the holy ghost
[39:11] you get the baptism of the holy ghost
[39:13] you're a bride
[39:14] if you don't you're foolish that's just
[39:16] cut and dry there's no in between
[39:18] amen either you're married or you're not
[39:23] so if you're married to christ you're
[39:24] either married to christ or the devil
[39:25] one of the two amen
[39:28] sorry
[39:31] you decide so the bride
[39:35] the body of jesus is on the earth as the
[39:37] bride
[39:39] and the son of god is not just anointing
[39:43] you but it's helping you through your
[39:44] life it's not just something that comes
[39:46] on you
[39:46] and then comes off of you no it's what
[39:49] something that stays there
[39:51] it stays with you just like it did on
[39:53] the river jordan brother
[39:54] uh when you look at john john looked and
[39:56] saw the spirit descending like the dove
[39:58] and remaining remaining on that person
[40:02] all right it remains on you and actually
[40:05] he said i'll be with you even
[40:07] in you to the end of the age so it's not
[40:09] that just god said because god can
[40:11] anoint you the devil can anoint you but
[40:13] only god
[40:14] can save you amen satan can't save you
[40:18] he make you feel good he makes you feel
[40:20] happy
[40:21] he can feel the church full but unless
[40:24] you got the new birth you'll just wander
[40:25] right back out you understand
[40:27] because there's nothing to hold you we
[40:28] were talking about the at the uh you
[40:30] say they were somebody asked what is the
[40:32] new birth
[40:33] well to me the new birth in a real
[40:35] simple form that'll really help you
[40:38] when you were born your ship and you got
[40:41] sails
[40:43] and that sail turns as the wind turns
[40:46] there's no rudder down underneath
[40:49] how can you control that boat you can't
[40:53] yeah because the wind's gonna blow that
[40:54] way brother john and you're gonna do
[40:56] whatever you can try to do it's still
[40:57] gonna go that way
[40:59] it's gonna blow that way but if you'll
[41:00] put i don't care the ship can be as big
[41:02] as this
[41:03] building if you can put a little three
[41:06] foot rudder you know what i'm talking
[41:08] about it goes under the bottom of the
[41:09] ship
[41:10] you can't be seen that's right
[41:15] but it's gonna run your boat but you put
[41:17] that rudder down there
[41:19] and the wind starts blowing that way but
[41:21] you want to go that way what you do
[41:22] you turn that rotor now it may fight
[41:25] and what they call in in airplanes they
[41:28] call it like uh
[41:29] crabbing because you go sideways but
[41:31] still once you got that rudder turned
[41:34] eventually when the winds of war and the
[41:36] winds of the devil quit blowing
[41:38] you're going to go the way you want to
[41:39] go just because that one little rudder
[41:41] that's the holy ghost
[41:43] hey look he didn't change the ship he
[41:46] didn't change the sale
[41:47] he just gave you a spiritual runner
[41:51] that when you get into something that
[41:53] thing will turn you
[41:55] brother branham what did he tell us he
[41:56] said the most important person on the
[41:58] ship not the captain
[42:00] he said guy down in the bottom is
[42:02] throwing the coal in
[42:04] they're saying turn to the left and he
[42:05] goes
[42:07] and what turns the rudder
[42:10] hey man that's the important person and
[42:13] you know what it's underwater you can't
[42:14] see it
[42:16] but it manifests itself by where it goes
[42:21] same way with a christian that was fresh
[42:24] by john i didn't really think of that
[42:25] but okay but you say well
[42:28] what it is it is the greatest thing ever
[42:30] happened to you but it's just a
[42:32] it's just a three-foot paddle underneath
[42:34] the water
[42:35] that turns you the way you need to go
[42:37] because you never had a spiritual rudder
[42:40] because you did the things of the world
[42:42] wind blow that way
[42:43] i don't care if you fall a little bit
[42:45] it's going to go your ship's going to go
[42:46] that way
[42:47] but you put that rotor in there same
[42:49] thing with an airplane you put your uh
[42:51] you put your flaps up and down you'll
[42:54] get to go where you need to go that's
[42:55] the new birth
[42:56] you ask god to give you the new birth
[42:59] and when you start looking
[43:00] at the things you used to do and you
[43:02] don't do them no more
[43:05] you're not even desiring to do them
[43:06] anymore and believe me
[43:09] satan's going to put them right there
[43:10] beside you
[43:13] but when you go nope there's a higher
[43:16] calling here buddy
[43:18] you used to play now you can't play no
[43:20] more you can play
[43:23] you can play all you want to the wind's
[43:24] gonna blow
[43:26] go out in the sea the wind's going to
[43:27] blow but you know what you've got that
[43:29] rudder down there that says no
[43:30] i'm going in that direction and that's
[43:33] what's going to take us up
[43:35] amen so let's read now what the prophet
[43:39] of god said because see that's our
[43:40] spiritual rhetoric down to the church
[43:41] ages which has been
[43:42] the son of god the the spirit of god
[43:45] inside of you
[43:47] the new birth to control you yes
[43:51] according to the word of god not
[43:52] according to the world
[43:54] all right everybody got that so that's
[43:56] what god gives us but now in the end
[43:58] time
[43:59] we are required a little bit different
[44:01] because we come to the
[44:03] loudest in church age and we've given
[44:06] some extra scriptures because without me
[44:09] and you
[44:12] because you got seven church ages and
[44:14] look that's it
[44:17] that's it there's no more there's no
[44:19] more big profit to come
[44:22] you and all are supposed to be prophetic
[44:25] people that's right you're right
[44:28] charlotte it is hot up here now with all
[44:29] these people up here y'all need to stop
[44:31] breathing for a little while okay
[44:34] i didn't broke holly no don't do that
[44:37] it's 70 degrees and that's about all
[44:39] it's doing but it's okay
[44:42] we're trying to get away from a harder
[44:44] place
[44:45] amen hey man
[44:49] you don't worry about that but we see
[44:52] there's no other church ages because i
[44:53] believe we're
[44:54] the seven stars in the seven churches
[44:56] we're number seven
[44:58] so god has already i believe sent us a
[45:02] messenger
[45:06] already sent it to us by the holy ghost
[45:08] because look he'll do nothing
[45:10] amen amos says i'll do nothing unless i
[45:14] reveal it to a prophet
[45:16] first because remember a prophet does
[45:19] two things when it hits the earth the
[45:20] prophet either gives you judgment or
[45:22] grace
[45:23] you reject that message it gives you
[45:25] judgment you accept that message it
[45:27] gives you grace
[45:28] and puts you in the body of christ and
[45:30] grace is what's going to take you in the
[45:32] rapture
[45:33] all right grace is what brought think of
[45:35] it people go out in the world well
[45:37] don't go out of the world but when you
[45:38] go out into the world you look around
[45:39] you see people
[45:41] you see people that's trying real hard
[45:44] you see people that ain't trying
[45:46] at all but they're trying the wrong
[45:49] thing
[45:53] they're wanting to be a good person
[45:54] they're wanting to be this they're
[45:55] wanting a good james dobson preacher
[45:57] they want some
[45:58] you know tell me how to and it is listen
[46:01] it is good to have those things to tell
[46:03] you how to live life
[46:05] all right do the right thing dave ramsey
[46:07] different people like that
[46:08] it is good to read those things but
[46:09] that's not going to save you
[46:12] but once you put the two together
[46:13] brother mike oakley we you know talking
[46:15] the other day
[46:16] he gave me a couple of books to read and
[46:18] that one of them was by schofield
[46:20] but see if you take scofield you got to
[46:21] remember schofield larkin
[46:24] uh you're a smith different ones they
[46:26] might
[46:27] they had the new birth i believe for
[46:28] their time because god did use them
[46:31] but they weren't vindicated prophets
[46:35] but you taken god put a vindicated
[46:37] prophet on the earth
[46:39] he reads their writings
[46:44] because if god give them their if god
[46:46] gave these people these writings and
[46:47] they were true
[46:48] then when he sent a prophet now then you
[46:51] take away that scofield was trinitarian
[46:53] that this one was trinitarian that this
[46:55] didn't believe this and then you god
[46:56] sent a prophet to restore everything
[46:58] back
[46:59] and now in the message they're saying
[47:01] well brother branham wasn't nothing he
[47:02] would just use their
[47:03] message well i'd like to ask them if
[47:05] they ever preached something out of the
[47:07] new testament
[47:08] then they're using paul's message
[47:10] [Music]
[47:12] grief you see how frivolous people try
[47:15] to grab straws you make somebody mad
[47:19] see that's what a good boxer will make
[47:20] the next boxer mad
[47:23] because he forgets all of his training
[47:25] and he just wants to beat you up
[47:27] and you just sit there and go all right
[47:29] buddy this is where i wanted you so he
[47:31] starts flailing and you just go pop up
[47:34] that's the way it is with the devil you
[47:35] make him mad boy he just starts sending
[47:36] everything
[47:38] that's all right if you got that rudder
[47:41] where are you going to be you're not
[47:43] going to be in shifting saying you're
[47:44] not going to be out in the ocean of
[47:46] of life not knowing where to go amen
[47:49] so god sent us a message in the end time
[47:52] to restore back
[47:53] the faith of the fathers and to reveal
[47:56] the book see the book the reason
[47:59] clarence larkin the reason scofield the
[48:01] reason
[48:02] you're a smith the reason even um
[48:06] billy graham oral roberts didn't have
[48:09] they weren't
[48:10] operating under an open book now for you
[48:13] that don't understand what i'm talking
[48:15] about
[48:16] when you shut a book i shut my book a
[48:19] book that i'm reading and i hand it to
[48:20] brother daugherty
[48:21] that's all right brother dardy here's
[48:23] the book
[48:24] three weeks later i go oh brother darnie
[48:26] you read that book no but i know what it
[48:28] says
[48:30] have you even opened it no but i know
[48:32] what it says
[48:34] well tell me the story behind it it
[48:36] can't tell you
[48:38] you got to hold in the book hey you got
[48:41] to read what's inside
[48:42] yes but now once i give it to brother
[48:44] doherty which i know he would
[48:46] i said look brother daughter it's a good
[48:47] book to read he'll open that book he'll
[48:48] read and he'll come back oh brother wait
[48:50] page 34 right there that's
[48:51] something good right there page 45. see
[48:53] i know he's read the book
[48:55] so now obviously scofield and those
[48:58] worked under a closed book because they
[48:59] had trinitarian ideas they had
[49:01] all these denominational ideas that were
[49:03] wrong but god winked at their ignorance
[49:05] during that day because he
[49:06] had to with luther because luther was
[49:08] trinitarian
[49:09] but luther had a message the just shall
[49:11] live by faith that was his message to
[49:13] the people
[49:14] amen but now you and i can't live under
[49:16] that because remember god keeps moving
[49:19] he moves further and further and further
[49:22] if you stay right here then you have
[49:23] left god
[49:28] and he's moving on so he's going to
[49:30] close your book
[49:32] the part that you had and he's going to
[49:33] come over here and now you and i
[49:36] we are living under when the seven seals
[49:38] were opened according to revelations
[49:41] 10 7 or 10 1 the mighty angel comes to
[49:44] the earth with what
[49:45] an open book now buddy when you come
[49:47] with an open book
[49:48] everything's made known so all the
[49:52] all the wrongs will be made right when
[49:55] the book is open
[49:56] everybody got that we live under now an
[49:59] open book
[50:00] listen you can close it back if you want
[50:02] to
[50:06] your choice that's right but if you keep
[50:09] that book open because remember john
[50:11] didn't need a closed book john eat an
[50:13] open book
[50:14] amen john eat an open book and that's
[50:16] what we have now
[50:17] we have an open book listen the book got
[50:19] closed down in the church ages what did
[50:21] the prophet of god tell us
[50:23] he said i indict this generation for the
[50:26] second crucifixion of jesus christ
[50:28] they put him back on the cross
[50:31] are we doing the same thing i want to
[50:34] ask you that question
[50:35] because he indicted a whole generation
[50:38] for doing the wrong thing
[50:40] when christ was standing there trying to
[50:42] reveal himself to the people
[50:44] same way with you and i all right so now
[50:46] let's read real quick now he
[50:47] he he's the son of god which is god
[50:51] in spirit form revealing himself to the
[50:54] church ages
[50:55] but listen not fully revealing because
[50:57] look
[50:58] the son of man is jesus christ
[51:01] we're going to get into that maybe later
[51:03] on not when we get finished with this
[51:04] series
[51:05] the son of man was god in human flesh
[51:10] total god you and i are apart
[51:17] but in him dwelt the what fullness of
[51:19] the godhead
[51:21] bodily you and i have a part of that
[51:24] so we're not because remember we were
[51:26] sex born
[51:28] he was virgin born biggest separation
[51:31] there is
[51:32] that just that just did away with all of
[51:34] us right
[51:36] he was virgin born and he was the son of
[51:38] god he was before all things
[51:40] he knew all things why because he was
[51:43] back over here watching all this
[51:45] take place but when he came down into
[51:48] this man right here named jesus christ
[51:51] you know god had to back up from the
[51:55] all-knowing
[51:57] and we'll get into it when we talk about
[51:58] the son of man he was the all-knowing
[52:00] god
[52:01] created all things knew all things
[52:05] he had to learn how to eat
[52:09] he had to learn how to move his finger
[52:13] he cried he had to have his diaper
[52:16] changed
[52:17] he couldn't do it himself but you know
[52:19] what he done it for
[52:21] he does it for me and you he did not do
[52:24] it for himself he did it for me and you
[52:26] he became a baby the bible says he
[52:28] learned by the things he suffered
[52:30] and being made perfect now listen in
[52:32] soul he was perfect because he's
[52:33] almighty god
[52:34] but when he come down to that human body
[52:36] that's where the eternal redemption part
[52:37] comes from
[52:38] you and i are heading toward that
[52:40] because listen if you're born again your
[52:42] soul is already redeemed
[52:44] all down to the church ages by the
[52:45] revelation of the son of god
[52:47] you're inside you is a theophany that
[52:49] real you that makes you move and
[52:51] you take that out today and then we do a
[52:53] lot of funerals
[52:55] the firing mechanism that's what you are
[52:57] that's the soul of you
[52:59] makes you do this makes you listen make
[53:01] you think what's going on and
[53:03] wish i'll hurry up so but not just not
[53:06] the holy ghost won't do that
[53:13] but that was a revelation of the son of
[53:14] god in the church ages
[53:16] was a part of god would come and give a
[53:18] message the part of god would come and
[53:19] give a message a part of god would come
[53:21] and give a message
[53:22] but then he said that according
[53:25] to luke 17 30 but let's read right here
[53:28] real quick i'm getting them
[53:29] ahead of myself let's read quote number
[53:31] one
[53:35] we got a few all right let's read quote
[53:38] number one take the chart off please
[53:41] feast of the trumpets now he's been
[53:43] revealed to the church ages now watch
[53:45] through the church ages as
[53:46] son of god god being a spirit the holy
[53:49] spirit
[53:50] he revealed himself in the church ages
[53:52] as in the congregation
[53:55] as the holy spirit among the people now
[53:58] but according to luke 17
[53:59] let's go to luke 17 verse 24 let's try
[54:03] to keep this in the bible
[54:05] i want you to read this with me real
[54:08] quick
[54:11] and then we'll we'll probably stop right
[54:12] here
[54:14] now for there's the lightning that
[54:17] lighteth out of the one part under
[54:18] heaven shineth unto the other part under
[54:20] heaven
[54:21] so shall also the son of man
[54:25] be in his day everybody got that be in
[54:28] his day
[54:30] but first must he suffer many things now
[54:33] and be rejected of this generation luke
[54:36] has put him in the physical form
[54:39] jesus standing on earth got anybody got
[54:42] that
[54:42] read that so shall also son of man be in
[54:45] his day
[54:47] that was what two thousand years ago in
[54:49] 80 30
[54:50] when jesus was standing on earth
[54:52] preaching his message everybody got that
[54:54] but first must he suffer many things and
[54:56] be rejected
[54:57] of this generation so listen if he
[54:59] suffers and he's rejected and he's here
[55:01] today
[55:02] guess what you're going to suffer i like
[55:04] what brother richard hyatt was preaching
[55:06] sunday he was talking about you know you
[55:07] get a
[55:08] you get a revelation and you have a
[55:10] cycle that you get a revelation you're
[55:11] happy and then all of a sudden here
[55:13] comes
[55:13] trouble right and it's the same thing
[55:16] over again you know everything's good
[55:17] everything's wonderful we do everything
[55:19] right and then all of a sudden here
[55:20] comes trouble
[55:21] but that's just a cycle of being a look
[55:24] think of paul
[55:26] i've been reading the writings of paul
[55:27] from another commentator man
[55:29] he spent he spent half his life in
[55:31] prison almost
[55:32] he was beat every how many times and
[55:35] almost dead they drug him out of the
[55:36] street one time thought he was dead
[55:38] have you ever been through that before
[55:40] then you ain't been persecuted
[55:42] so don't worry about the little paper
[55:44] cuts that you get
[55:46] i told ruth i said ruth i got a paper
[55:48] cut i need to i need to leave
[55:50] she wasn't very sympathetic
[55:55] but now we think the trials it gets us
[55:57] you go back and watch
[55:58] look at what happened to those
[56:00] christians that just standing up and
[56:02] saying i'm a christian in the street
[56:04] you got your head cut off or you got fed
[56:06] the lines and that was the worst death
[56:07] because it took a while before they got
[56:08] you eat up
[56:10] so listen the little persecutions that
[56:12] we suffer
[56:14] nothing compared the bible said to the
[56:16] glory
[56:18] that we're going to receive and you've
[56:20] never been put on a cross either and
[56:21] beat like a piece of hamburger meat
[56:23] like this man was all right and as it
[56:26] was in the days of noah now look as it
[56:28] was in the days of noah right before a
[56:30] destruction
[56:32] everybody got that look when the son of
[56:34] man shows up right before a destruction
[56:38] so shall it be also in the days of the
[56:40] son of man
[56:41] they did eat they drank they married
[56:43] wives they were given in marriage here
[56:45] we go again
[56:46] until the day that noah entered in the
[56:48] ark and the flood came and destroyed
[56:50] them
[56:51] all likewise also it was in the days of
[56:54] what now here we go right before another
[56:56] destruction
[56:58] before sodom and gomorrah is being
[56:59] destroyed we see somebody come on the
[57:01] scene
[57:03] amen you ever thought about that that's
[57:05] why the son of man he shows up right
[57:06] before destruction
[57:09] likewise also it was in the days of what
[57:12] they did eat
[57:13] they drank they bought they sold they
[57:16] planted they built it
[57:17] everybody in this church did have one of
[57:19] those last week
[57:22] bro gary build it i planted
[57:26] some good good christmas llama beans
[57:30] so anyway so look this is then it's
[57:32] vindicating showing our day
[57:34] but in the same day that lot went out of
[57:36] sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[57:38] heaven and destroyed them
[57:40] all even thus shall it be in the day
[57:44] when the son of man is revealed all
[57:47] right
[57:48] so now that's not talking about jesus
[57:50] this time
[57:51] it showed his time before that this is
[57:54] talking about us
[57:54] before a destruction comes behold i will
[57:57] send you elijah the prophet before the
[57:59] what
[57:59] great and dreadful day of the lord
[58:02] because listen
[58:03] we might have minor tribulation but the
[58:06] great tribulation
[58:07] is the wrath of god poured out upon a
[58:10] godless people
[58:11] you'll never see that if you're born
[58:13] again all right
[58:15] so we know that the son of man is to be
[58:18] revealed in the end time before a
[58:20] destruction
[58:22] so god's gonna send us look at verse two
[58:24] i mean
[58:25] quote number two
[58:29] jesus said as it was in the days of
[58:30] sodom this was jesus talking
[58:32] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[58:34] of man look at that angel down there to
[58:35] the church
[58:36] elect what he did look at jesus what he
[58:39] done in his generation
[58:41] look down here at this generation what
[58:42] he's doing now
[58:44] they'll receive a sign but they won't
[58:46] believe it
[58:48] the whole world saw great signs and
[58:50] miracles and wonders that the prophet
[58:52] did always seven times around the world
[58:55] but when he started preaching his
[58:57] message they rejected him
[58:58] forgot what he did before same way with
[59:01] jesus they forgot the five thousand he
[59:03] fed they forgot the healing that he did
[59:05] and they hung him on a cross but now we
[59:08] know that william branham was not the
[59:09] son of man because the requirement of
[59:11] these son of man
[59:12] is is you'd be born with no sex so that
[59:15] just discludes all of us
[59:17] except one guy that's the lord jesus
[59:19] christ all right
[59:20] but the resurrection will be the sign
[59:22] here we go again like i said
[59:24] this whole everything's based on
[59:25] resurrection
[59:28] because you're going to have you had a
[59:29] resurrection in the old testament
[59:32] you had jesus the old testament saints
[59:35] right then we're looking for this
[59:37] resurrection to come
[59:38] then we're looking for a resurrection of
[59:40] the jews
[59:41] then we're looking at a general
[59:43] resurrection so it's all based on
[59:44] resurrection
[59:46] what you do here bases which
[59:49] resurrection you make it to
[59:52] see you can't do like like i said before
[59:54] some of the commentaries i'm reading you
[59:55] know you
[59:56] you well when i get to the great white
[59:57] throne i'm going to plead my case oh
[59:59] lord
[1:00:01] if i make it there i don't have a case
[1:00:04] i don't have a case if i have to go to
[1:00:05] the white throne judgment i have no case
[1:00:08] god took my case
[1:00:11] that don't make you happy god took my
[1:00:14] case
[1:00:15] and he destroyed it he even took the
[1:00:17] book and thrown it out the window
[1:00:19] and it hit in the sea somewhere
[1:00:23] the sea of god is forgetful is never to
[1:00:25] be remembered again
[1:00:28] but the resurrection will be the sign
[1:00:30] and the resurrection the sign is given
[1:00:31] to the church in this last day
[1:00:33] what did i say before no man in the
[1:00:36] history of time except jesus christ
[1:00:38] himself
[1:00:39] stood in front of a congregation and
[1:00:40] said you were at the doctor yesterday
[1:00:42] you had on a blue dress with a yellow
[1:00:44] ribbon
[1:00:45] in your hair and the doctor told you
[1:00:47] this and the doctor said this
[1:00:48] he said your house number's 242 williams
[1:00:51] street and your name is wade dale
[1:00:54] nobody has ever done that before
[1:00:58] in that grand of form where everybody
[1:01:00] heard it now it may have been done in
[1:01:02] paul's age it may have been done in
[1:01:03] iranians
[1:01:04] but it never was done on a public stage
[1:01:07] to where god is going to prove that he's
[1:01:10] opened the book
[1:01:12] and one man a prophet is going to
[1:01:14] release that
[1:01:16] power to the bride
[1:01:20] now listen we're not going to ever see
[1:01:21] it like that in one man
[1:01:23] but jesus said greater works will you do
[1:01:27] because it'll be in a group of people
[1:01:30] how many of you have seen healings
[1:01:32] how many of you prayed for the sick how
[1:01:33] many of you have saw mighty miracles
[1:01:35] that might
[1:01:36] see it's not just one person anymore but
[1:01:39] he had to take that one man standing
[1:01:41] there saying it's not me it's him
[1:01:44] amen the holy ghost come down
[1:01:47] and discern those people's thoughts
[1:01:51] and it never was wrong one time amen
[1:01:55] and look don't base your salvation on
[1:01:58] that though
[1:02:00] you'd better never base your salvation
[1:02:02] on i heard a prophet say
[1:02:05] no but remember that spiritual rudder
[1:02:08] inside
[1:02:08] if you don't have it one little thing
[1:02:11] pops up
[1:02:12] like they're saying now he did this he
[1:02:14] did that he was wrong here he was wrong
[1:02:16] there
[1:02:16] your ship is gonna go shipwrecked but if
[1:02:19] you've got that spiritual rudder you'll
[1:02:21] turn against that wind and you'll make
[1:02:22] sure you go north
[1:02:24] amen up don't worry about all that stuff
[1:02:28] but the angel of the holy spirit in the
[1:02:30] meetings showing the same thing doing
[1:02:31] the same thing across the nation proving
[1:02:33] that jesus
[1:02:34] christ is raised from the dead the same
[1:02:35] yesterday today and forever
[1:02:37] that's the generation that we're
[1:02:40] receiving
[1:02:40] which i contend that's this generation
[1:02:42] we're looking at right now
[1:02:44] and that was a healing campaign but i'm
[1:02:46] looking for healing of the soul but then
[1:02:48] we're going to look for
[1:02:49] before the culmination of everything the
[1:02:54] bride has got to come to a place
[1:02:56] just like jesus was standing on earth
[1:02:58] you said you can't do it
[1:03:01] have you ever read john 17.
[1:03:05] john 17 says father i pray
[1:03:10] i pray for them not to take you out of
[1:03:14] the world
[1:03:15] but that you'll stay in the world but he
[1:03:18] said i pray father that
[1:03:19] they be one as you and i are one so how
[1:03:24] many ones were they
[1:03:26] jesus and god was one person
[1:03:30] and he prayed that we would be the same
[1:03:32] way
[1:03:34] and you know what that's kind of hard
[1:03:36] for a human to figure out
[1:03:39] but i didn't say it god did
[1:03:42] so he's going to have to make a way for
[1:03:44] me to get us there and i believe he has
[1:03:46] he sent us the word of god
[1:03:47] he sent us the prophet end time to open
[1:03:49] the book so that we can truly
[1:03:50] read the bible with with eyes of
[1:03:54] understanding
[1:03:55] not eyes of this may be right and this
[1:03:57] may be wrong and i'll take what paul
[1:03:58] says
[1:03:59] or not what peter says i'll take what
[1:04:00] jesus says over what peter says
[1:04:04] the whole problem with that is it's why
[1:04:07] would jesus stand up one day and said
[1:04:09] baptize in the name of the father and of
[1:04:10] the son of the holy ghost
[1:04:12] but several weeks prior he said peter
[1:04:17] i'm going to give you the keys to the
[1:04:18] kingdom
[1:04:21] and whatever you bind on earth
[1:04:24] i'll bind in heaven whatever you loose
[1:04:27] on earth
[1:04:28] i'll loose in heaven
[1:04:32] so jesus goes away and comes back on the
[1:04:34] day of pentecost he enters into peter
[1:04:36] and changes his mind
[1:04:40] don't change his mind through peter who
[1:04:43] had the keys
[1:04:45] he said repent every one of you and be
[1:04:49] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:04:52] that's the name of god for the remission
[1:04:55] of your sins and you shall receive the
[1:04:56] gift of the holy ghost you know what
[1:04:58] jesus wasn't in another another
[1:05:00] dimension going peter no no
[1:05:02] no no no no he was going perfect that's
[1:05:05] exactly what i was saying
[1:05:07] that's exactly what i wanted you to get
[1:05:08] to the people because he heard that key
[1:05:11] and you know what jesus was in heaven
[1:05:13] and he said
[1:05:14] i told you if you unlocked it down here
[1:05:16] i'll unlock it up there
[1:05:18] he said click i just then unlocked it
[1:05:21] for you peter
[1:05:22] and no man can shut that key
[1:05:25] i don't care what denomination they
[1:05:27] can't shut that key
[1:05:30] think about that because you have peter
[1:05:34] people say well peter was saying this in
[1:05:35] acts and jesus was saying
[1:05:37] is the bible that confused no no
[1:05:41] no jesus was just conveying through a
[1:05:43] person that had the key
[1:05:46] amen peter had the key he'd already give
[1:05:48] it to him
[1:05:50] so anyway all right let's go right here
[1:05:52] and then we'll we will stop
[1:05:55] so everything's based on resurrection
[1:05:58] resurrection is a state of having passed
[1:06:00] completely through death
[1:06:01] and having risen from death to be in
[1:06:04] resurrection is different than to be
[1:06:05] alive
[1:06:06] we're going to get to where the alive
[1:06:08] and remain to be alive is the original
[1:06:10] state without having passed through
[1:06:12] death
[1:06:13] to be in resurrection is to have passed
[1:06:15] through death
[1:06:16] and have been raised up so resurrection
[1:06:17] there had to be a death
[1:06:19] that's why when we take you to the water
[1:06:20] we go to a burial
[1:06:22] yes if you want to be baptized correctly
[1:06:24] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:06:26] you gotta die we're going to a burial
[1:06:29] we're going to a funeral
[1:06:31] because i put you in the water brother
[1:06:33] dale any preacher puts you in the water
[1:06:35] death that's right burial
[1:06:39] resurrection in the newness of life old
[1:06:42] things are passed away leave it in the
[1:06:44] water
[1:06:46] because you'll get the promise of the
[1:06:47] holy ghost if you'll do that right you
[1:06:48] don't have a promise of the holy ghost
[1:06:50] and father son holy ghost
[1:06:53] you get a promise in acts 2 38 that if
[1:06:56] you'll do that
[1:06:56] you'll get the holy ghost pretty simple
[1:07:00] all right revelations 20 verse 4 and i
[1:07:03] saw thrones
[1:07:04] musicians get ready to come i'll stop
[1:07:06] right here and they that sat on them and
[1:07:07] judgment was given unto them them them
[1:07:09] who's them the bride
[1:07:13] and i saw the souls of them that will be
[1:07:14] headed for the witness of jesus for the
[1:07:16] word of god which did not worship the
[1:07:17] beast that's
[1:07:18] us neither his image neither receives
[1:07:20] his mark upon their forehead
[1:07:22] not tattooed on their forehead what is
[1:07:25] this part of you that's your
[1:07:26] intelligence
[1:07:28] you've taken on a wrong doctrine
[1:07:32] or in their hands what works and they
[1:07:35] lived and reigned with christ a thousand
[1:07:36] years but the rest of the dead
[1:07:38] lived not again until the thousand years
[1:07:39] was finished this is the first
[1:07:41] resurrection on such the second death
[1:07:45] hath no power but they shall be priest
[1:07:47] of god and of christ and shall reign
[1:07:49] with him
[1:07:49] one thousand years we'll finish the rest
[1:07:56] this afternoon musicians come
[1:07:58] rule and reign one thousand years first
[1:08:00] thessalonians don't pull it up
[1:08:01] but i wouldn't i have you ignorant
[1:08:03] brethren come on concerning them which
[1:08:04] are asleep that you saw or not
[1:08:06] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:08:08] rose again even sow them also with sleep
[1:08:10] in jesus
[1:08:12] will god bring with him for this i say
[1:08:14] to you by the word of the lord that we
[1:08:15] which are alive
[1:08:18] and remain not not not have to be
[1:08:21] resurrected
[1:08:23] because it said alive if you're alive
[1:08:25] and you haven't
[1:08:26] died you can't be resurrected
[1:08:30] you were spiritually resurrected by the
[1:08:32] new birth yes
[1:08:33] absolutely but this body's got to be
[1:08:36] changed
[1:08:38] in a moment in twinkling of an eye let's
[1:08:39] stand to our feet
[1:08:41] we'll finish the rest this afternoon god
[1:08:43] bless you
[1:08:45] come back for part number two go ahead
