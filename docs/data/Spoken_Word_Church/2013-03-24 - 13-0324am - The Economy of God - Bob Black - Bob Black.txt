let's just say open the eyes of my heart is brother bob black comes to speak the word of the lord unto us this day then open the eyes of my heart is i want to see you is foreign let's turn in our scripture to ezekiel chapter one and then ephesians chapter three we had a little excitement this morning the internet went down and now it's back up and then my bible turned up missing for a little bit and it turned back up it has a habit of doing that when i teach sunday school yeah and now this morning so we just want to settle down and yeah and relax and um that the word can come forth so uh ezekiel chapter one let's let's go to the lord in prayer lord jesus we remember we were reminded of in the old testament how the lord when they were they went under the shed blood under the covering of the door to feast on your word and the lamb was provided for them to feast on under the shed blood and outside death was all over the land thank you lord amen now lord lord i pray that you'll be with us this morning lord as we feast upon your word and open your word to us it's a song we're saying open the eyes of our heart lord we come expecting lord to see you and to receive from you amen i pray god that you will not leave let one of us leave for this house this morning without receiving what we come expecting lord we ask it lord that you'll come and be present here with us this morning because we know if you're not here then we come in vain but we come to worship around the shed blood lord we ask you that you'll be with us this morning in your name in the name of our precious lord and savior jesus christ amen amen ezekiel chapter 1 verse 15 and 16 says now as i beheld the living creatures behold one will upon the earth by the living creatures with his four faces the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of a barrel and they had and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel now let's go to ephesians chapter three and read just a little bit of this for this call that thy paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given to me given me to your word how that by revelation he made known to me the mystery as i wrote before in a few words then we'll just stop right there you may be seated unless anybody just wants to remain standing but i wanted to speak this morning on this word dispensation that in the original greek was is where we get our word economy and the original greek the word was economia and uh just talk about how god has an economy that's built around his word the revelation of his word and the spirit moving in the people in his church and paul talked about how that he was given uh a dispensation that you know the the full the complete plan is like a ruler that's divided up into little pieces the full plan is there's god expressing himself that's what the full plan is and paul had he saw that he had part of that plan to begin to express god and and what to them was a mystery that was being unveiled that god would express himself in a people that that uh the jews excuse me the jews thought would not be called the people that were pulled from all different parts of the earth that unclean people the gentiles and so paul began to uh he if you look all down through the scripture there's so many wonderful scriptures about this mystery right now the thing about a mystery is it's it's something that we don't know what it is and until it's un revealed then uh it can't be fulfilled because how we don't know what it is uh to paul this mystery of the scripture being thank you brother revealed to the uh that god will express himself in a gentile church and the gentile dispensation would uh because it was revealed to paul then now it can be made manifest and then first let's see ephesians chapter 1 verses 9 through 10 he said having made known just the mystery of his reveal according to his good pleasure he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together and want all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him so as we go through these scriptures and go through this little lesson just picture in your mind the ezekiel the wheel in the middle of the wheel because this is that's the the symbol of the economy of god that i'd be speaking of and then colossians 1 chapter 1 25-27 paul tells us the full picture of this mystery he said wherever i have made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word even the mystery which have been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you and the hope of glory now let me uh i just want to start off by going to uh john chapter six and let's uh kind of go through this because this is a picture of an economy that jesus in the middle and the church spread around right ready to receive the word and uh to set the stage we can read the story across all of the four gospels and kind of get a better picture there's some things that mark includes that john didn't include and uh we know that this this story happened after john the baptist had died they think about how you know the messenger for your day has gone off the scene what's going to happen who's going to lead the people where do we receive our word from is there any particular man that we're going to receive our orders from or is it from where where do we get our word right after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee which is the sea of tiberias and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased and jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with us with his disciples and the passover the feast of the jews was nigh and why was that included in this because the passover is where the lamb was eaten exactly you eat the word right exactly and now here the word is in their midst and they fail to recognize who he is when jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he's saying to philip when shall we buy bread that these may eat now the first thing i want to point out is that jesus and john's little tailing of it jesus is the first one to be concerned and if you ever wonder is god concerned about me is he yeah right that's right exactly amen you know sometimes we think god doesn't care about me nobody nobody cares but he was the first one to speak he was one i was concerned all right he entered into the situation with compassion and you know in romans it tells us that we should when other when others are are joyful we should be joyful with them we should weep with him and so jesus was he wasn't just getting there right all these poor people that don't know anything he was he entered into them with compassion and he wanted he asked phillip where are we gonna buy where where can we get bread now in mark's telling other story philip responded we need to send them away yeah yeah all right because in other words we don't have we don't have them here and a lot of times down through life you'll see you just observing uh people's reaction to the word they fail to recognize the word in their midst right and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do philip answered him 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little just a little bit all right philip wanted them to have just a little bit and you know he made a calculation he figured up in his head how much money it would take to buy enough food for all these people but he failed to make a calculation that he failed to add in that christ he didn't add that to the calculation one of his disciples andrew simon peter's brother said unto him there is a lad here which has five body loads and two small fishes but what are they among so many and jesus said make the men sit down now that's an important point too because a lot of times we hurry and we bustle around we don't take time a quiet time just get along with god and let him speak to us we're hustling and bustling to and fro but uh you know another thing that when the word is in was that when the word is in control when you yield yourself to the word then the word begins to put things in order right mark martin the gospel of mark mark tells us that they sat down by 100 by by uh they sat down in ranks of 50s and hundreds because the word was in their midst they ordered them and the word is it begins to order and place your doctrine and your life and it has to move everything and put it in just the right place that's what i'm talking about this morning the placing of the word and the economy of god in your life and in your church and everything everything that where god is and jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were shut down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would as much as they would because i'm not thirsty i'll be feeling right now it's interesting that in this little story that jesus broke the bread and you might stand you can stand back from this congregation and maybe look at what say what's different between this church and the church next door what's different between all the different churches you maybe have took a step back and looked at this scene of jesus breaking the bread and hanging out to the disciples and thought well they're just they're just a bunch of people eating they're eating but something was happening distributed out dispensed right to the people that sat around and uh so looking at the scene maybe one of the people that were sitting there might say well this brother brother phillip brother andrew but phillips bringing the bread and the loaves he has given it to someone that's that's hungry right that's thirsting right and he's giving it to them they receive it with thanksgiving and they say philip you're the one that broke the bread but that would be incorrect i'm standing here today not to introduce you to myself right but the introduction of christ you know the corinthians had that problem when paul began to preach to them he said you think that you're saved because that you you've been baptized by me or by apollos about uh any of these other brothers you think that's that's what your faith is based on but you can't base your economy your your fear of what you believe you're the rock that you're finding your revelation is based on right on on where you go to church or who baptized you or uh that i am i'm a message believer i go to a message church you've got to have an experience so um then further on down you know they they did recognize in this little story that who jesus was because they recognized that he was breaking the bread and further down in verse 26 jesus answered and said very very i say unto you you seek me not because you saw the miracles but because you didn't eat of the loaves and were filled you labor not for the meat which perishes but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him half the father have god the father sealed right right that's the whole point of the christian journey to eat and eat right manifest in you now i want to take a little maybe paint a big picture across the all the whole scripture this morning from the beginning to the end and let's start at john 1 1 in the beginning now you know the only thing that god that brother graham said that the only prayer that jesus had one thing he really wanted right before he went to glory was that i go where i go you may be also that was his desire where he would have fellowship with us and that was his desire all the way from the beginning and jesus didn't start christ didn't start at the in the cradle he started we read john john chapter one right he was he was the one that created the world all things and go all the way back to the beginning where he began in genesis chapter 1 verse 1 he created the heavens and the earth and he created he spun out by the word uh the solar system and the galaxies and everything now picture this now he created the sun and then as the planets just to to create a little picture the planets began to zoom by the big old jupiter the sun caught it and moved it right into its orbit and they couldn't escape the power of the sun right it moved it right in line right as big as jupiter as you think my i got a problem in my life it's too big for the world you know i got i got something that that god's word just can't can't tackle but now jupiter moved right in and orbit around and was placed positionally just right perfectly in orbit and from then on it never deviated it's just so perfect how all the all the planets move then and just the concert and then god began to uh he created he created another economy in heaven an economy of angels and he created the seraphims the burners that take the prayers of the saints and offered him up in in the temple and you know moses when he went up in the mountain to to create the god showed him the tabernacle for the saint for the for the uh the israelites to worship for moses the pattern of the tabernacle um brother brown said what he really saw was he saw solomon's temple with the pillars right and uh because you know it's written in isaiah that the the when the seraphim's cried holy holy is the lord of hosts that they actually shook the pillars of the temple right with their praise and uh so he had a whole economy in heaven that moses modeled the tabernacle after it right a whole economy built around his word the seraphims were placed the cherubims gabriel michael all different eight world war the different angels that had different tasks wormwood uh the judgment angel and and all the different angels and they had an economy placed around his word and uh lucifer didn't realize what was going on right he thought i'm so holy and you know yeah we we've met people before that we we know someone we met someone before that uh had visions and things because i have visions yeah then give them a message book and they said well that's that's not right and fail to recognize the word right right and uh present uh just the simplicity of of how you should a woman should cut or not cut her hair and live holy before god and uh we talked a lot about this in that little bible study at home about how the bible was so plain to say that a woman's hair is giving her for recovering right and usually it's just written there in black and white right and fails it doesn't really even need a revelation to see that you maybe sometimes we think we're so holy that uh uh we don't need we fail to recognize god's word right but and that's exactly what happened to lucifer in isaiah it's written how he was he was so you know he was the the most decorated angel so beautiful he had that beautiful singing voice and you know that's another thing you think my goodness if we only had such a uh you look at other churches and think if they had if we could have a song service like that and then you watch a song leader that's that you think is so wonderful and then fall and start putting up websites about how uh this message isn't true and things right uh because they fail to recognize the word and uh so lucifer you know brother branham said that michael was christ right but when michael stepped out he didn't know who that was right and started a war with it and uh then they took the war down to uh to heaven to earth and um you know god began to create he he he's a god of different economies the same economy with his word in the in the middle and um so what he did is the whole purpose of his grand design is to express himself right so he came down to earth he he began to reach out and pull from this place potash a little bit of this place from clay and a little bit of this place and some dirt from over here and you know you look at each of these little pieces of dirt and say well that that's there's nothing to that look out in this congregation and look at each individual one and say well uh you know this this brother may not be too much to look at or they came from a bad background or something what can god do with this person but again he began to mold it into a pressure and pulled it all together and brought out from the dust of the earth brother said he actually had he was he had when god molded this man he had one foot stuck in the ground and he was stuck there right and then he breathed into him the breath of life the eternal life and that word that was inside of adam began to move everything the the what god had molded together out of the mud and out of the clay moved it together into a perfect little solar system where god where adam was fortified behind the word and remember adam could not be deceived right right so lucifer's looking at this situation how can i get in here he's fortified behind god's word how can i how can i get into this picture okay where can i stick a pry bar to get in right i can't go into him yeah so i'm gonna have to get him to come out to me right yeah and that's what if you stay fortified behind god's word i just read through all the scriptures where brother god talked about being fortified behind his god's word and you know it's really our choice to stay fortified behind it's your choice how much time you want to spend praying and reading his bible right and and developing a close relationship with him so lucifer could see with his eyes but not but not by revelation right and then the same thing happened with e for she couldn't she could see with her eyes but uh she she missed she missed god's point god's his great his grand plan was the same thing that it is today to express himself right and she couldn't hold on until the spoken word was made manifest and the children of god that would be brought forth now go back to the angels now because this is a good point to think about think about you a lot of times going through life's problems and things you think well i'm alone but god created a whole economy in heaven this is what lucifer lucifer didn't see but he created a whole economy in heaven around fulfilling his word right here all right all right that's right he created all of these angels we're trying to help you so that you could bring him and bring him into being in luke 15 10 i'm just going to read through some of these scriptures there's joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner somebody says i i believe that all of the angels there's a want to know these secret things in luke 2 13 it says they uh they were praising god over the fields of shepherds to announce that savior was born amen the savior in luke 1 26 that gabriel announced the birth of the messiah luke 22 43 the angels were present in the reciprocal where the lord rushed in acts 1 10 he uh it said which also said he men of galilee watch stand you gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven so shall come in like manner as you have seen monday night and in psalm 34 7 the angel of the lord and campus round the batman that fear him and deliver them and in genesis 19 1-15 uh the angels rescued a lot from sodom right and just only on how the angels are concerned with the revenge of mankind they're not just sitting up there watching things but they're active because god created a whole economy right here based on his with the center of his word right the whole thing is is based on him right it's centered on him and created an economy just to express himself and the economy that was expressed in the garden of eden an economy uh that was expressed in this creation and the solar system and an economy is expressed in this church right here the common that's expressed right then you and me individually that's right and you know in the garden of eden their economy was placed around the tree of life they uh every every evening they cool in the evening they would they would walk to see the center of that economy the whole garden right to speak with him and fantasy they just lost sight of of the uh of the vision right man now switch gears a little bit and move on down to moses and the 10 commandments you know how they they uh they waited for moses when moses went up for 40 days they were waiting for his word to be made manifest right they were waiting for what turned out to be the god the word of god made manifest and tables of stone right uh and you know they couldn't wait for that to happen they became impatient and he had a doubt and reason in their hearts right and uh you know remember we were talking about enoch last time how enoch was this this the tortoise wins the race slow and steady right so just hang on keep hanging on keep believing god's word because you can't hang on by yourself but then they they waited for that those tablets to come down from the mountain and when they did moses found them they had taken a substitute they had moved the center of their economy which was the word and then moved it to something else golden calves and they began to put all their focus on that right just like lucifer moved the center of his economy from michael on himself and he moved the center of her economy from the tree of life onto what the beast had was preaching to her and they moved that center of their economy onto the golden caps and the hope that that would in the vain hope that that would be a better situation now moses took he remember he had that model for the uh the the tabernacle in the wilderness so he took those tab those tablets and he put them in the in the center of that little model yeah in the center of the of the uh of the tabernacle in the wilderness along with aaron's rod that butted and the manna and as they journey through the wilderness they feasted on that man which you know in our day brother said to shout is that bread of life that came down in heaven we're feasting on this message and so they were eating on the manna they were feasting on it they were being led by the spirit the the center of their economy was the word and as they camped they all formed a little they all grouped clustered around the word and now um brothers if you want to go ahead and pull up that little picture um we i know we've looked at this before of how they camped around they are a jew and it's karin's england on the right hand side and benjamin and manasseh from on the left now or on the west and and the international natalie on the north and and so forth but now the levites had a special place they were real close real close to the word and why were they that close because god had chosen them based on their confession right in exodus 32 26 29 when moses came down and he saw what they had done moses stood in the camp of the gate and said who is on the lord's side let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gather themselves together unto him and he said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel put every man his sword by his side and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother that every man is companion every man is neighbor and the children of levi did according to the word of moses and their fellow people that day about 3 000 men now so they wanted they were close to the word right because they wanted to be close to the word right and i just want to impress you with that they wanted to be close to the word right so the question is how close do you want to be the word and i told this little story to the sunday school class um and uh this is one of those stories that's open for offense to open for maybe to be offended a little bit but bye but um i i tell the story about there was a the brother that married my um my sister-in-law and brother-in-law was down at a meeting in florida and he passed away during the service and the spirit of the lord was there in such a mighty way and brother billy paul was there and i'm not trying to glorify anybody or anything i'm just telling a story right and billy paul took the man and and they some of the other brothers took him and took him into the back room and began to pray for him and the angel of the lord showed up and the man was raised from the dead such a mighty presence was there in that place i wasn't there but it was told to me that the the spirit of the lord was so great in that place and one of the brothers uh said something that really impressed me was that you know as as great as that presence was in that place the pillar of fire you know you could just feel the presence of the lord that mighty wind moving through the building but you know you can have that same presence with you every day like life you know that's something to think about you know you think well i can only feel the presence of the lord when i come to church or when i when i spend hours and hours praying or or when i dedicate lots and lots of time but we should be huddled so close around the world until his presence is with us all the time not just some of the time right uh howard won't say that not just all the time and you know god does it you know that perusian doctrine was that he's over here or he's over there but i don't want him over there right just when i come to church but i want him with me all the time i want to take him so that's picture that in your mind the the levites were huddled around the word all of the israelites as they journeyed through the wilderness when they would travel they had a certain order they would unfold and they would just wheel out that wheel that ezekiel saw and they would move forth and when they would stop they would roll back around the ark and they would like circling the wagons and take the word right so lucifer is looking at that situation just like he looked at adam they're fortified behind the word of god how can i get in there how can i move upon the scene how can i what can i do and there was the mole bites balaam and bayli looked upon the scene and uh they like said we'll curse them yeah try try to curse them yeah so baylor tried as hard as he could you know he what balaam was trying to do was he was trying to be a negotiator between balak and god now how can you how can you negotiate with god hey like says one thing and balaam because running back well he didn't like that so much god now god uh you know that yeah um you know what numbers 22 12 13 let's let's see if we can read that real quick how how balaam i used to wonder when i was reading the scripture what what did balaam do that was so bad numbers 22 12 and 13. and god said unto babel thou shalt not go with them right thou shalt not curse the people that's right for they are blessed amen and balaam now listen to this he's leaving stuff out just like the beast changed changed what god had said and balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of bayley get you into your land for the lord refuses to give me leave to go with you and he said a whole lot more than that he said no right and uh so balaam tried to be a little negotiator and when that didn't work when he saw it these people were blessed despite all their little problems all the little things that they had done he failed to see that they had a sacrifice in the camp they had that brazen serpent to an offering for all the little problems that they had done he couldn't he couldn't understand how they could god would be with him that god would be unveiling his word and manifesting himself to them and revealing to his people that the pillar of fire would be in that camp right and uh you know someone mentioned a few weeks ago what's the difference between message believers and other churches what's the difference the difference is god is revealing his word we know what the mystery is his word is being made manifest amen right and then uh just move you know god showed that as balaam tried to manipulate god god god showed that he was created by amen manipulating bible right and he ended up showing that was dumber than that yeah uh and then just moving on to the next little next little economy that i want to talk about is solomon's temple how you know before uh the first king king saw that the israelites they they were led by the spirit of god right through judges right that uh over a period of time the israelites kind of wane in their faith and god would send another judge to rescue them and bring them back to the faith but then they wanted a king so god raised up king saul and then uh and then king david after him who really unified all of israel around the world and began to accumulate treasures from all over the all over the land and traders and building materials from all around the world from tyre and phoenician from canaan and building blocks and stones and he began and he got everything ready so that when solomon his son became into his king kingdom that he would be able to build a temple right and he built it blah blah blah stoned by stone without one hammer sound without one noise and everything was just perfectly cut beforehand so that when it was brought to the building site it could be placed positionally placed according just just right now picture this building this building is all finished but when it's all finished it doesn't do any good unless it's a unless there's somebody in there right right so that on the day of the dedication all of these little building blocks have been brought from all around the world and brought into this great temple and solomon praised that prayer lord that you've come and lived here and that if anyone is in trouble anywhere in the world and turn their face and that you hear that prayer because they they're looking to your word to the center of their economy right to your economy to your to your to to where your word is right i remember jonah prayed that prayer when he was in the belly of the well he you know how would he know which way the temple was he was looking by faith right to that holy of holies god delivered him and so that temple that temple is a type of the church because each of those stones we talk about uh you know how they rejected the cornerstone but what about the other stones how we can look at our brothers and sisters they say well that it's not gonna make a good place in the building that's that'll never fit right but you know let god uh chisel away it and hold it into his image and place it right and it'll end up being just fit perfectly right in line with with everything else and every stone has a place and every stone has a purpose in the building right now you know zerubbabel said uh zaruga was a steward it was sent back to uh to went back to israel to begin building on the temple and without god working in on the scene durable would never have been able to return back to jerusalem you know they say that uh god started revolts and darius's empire on the other side so that these the israelites could return back and begin building this temple and even when it when they got back you know they had all this problems and turmoil but but god was with him to help them build the temple and he said then he answered in zechariah 4 6 then he answered and speaking to me saying this is the word of the lord and this root will sing not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art the old great mountain before the river thou shalt become a plain great mountain a great mountain that the devil rose up and slits cut down by the sword of god's word to make to be made flat and he shall bring forth a hit stone thereof with shouting he's crying erase grace under it god's building up a church and now let's uh look next to john chapter 3. i've been sitting on john a lot lately and uh there's some good things here and john chapter three i think right here is that how god is building up his church his body john chapter 3 there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and you know he got a reputation from that yeah every other time in scripture that he's referred to it says nicodemus who came to jesus by night yeah but you know he was there when defending him in the to the sanhedrin and he he uh was there with joseph of era mathea to bring murran alone when jesus's death he was there and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him now i want to just look at this for a second because if you look at all the different economies that we looked at at lucifer with his his it looked so beautiful and he was so holy and so close to god how are we to discern what is right what is right and what is true nicodemus have correct discernment as he was approaching jesus we know that you're correct because there are many miracles done by you right now remember that in the old testament when when moses began when the plagues began to fall on moses the first plague was the water turned into blood and they were able to duplicate that by their their little uh their little magic tricks and things and then the next the frogs came out of the out of the river and they were able to duplicate that right they were able to copy that but they couldn't copy when the gnats came in to be smaller than that god god can create life but the devil can never bring something to life sometimes something that's dead and worthless he can't bring it right amen to life so nicodemus is coming to jesus and saying no man can do these miracles and you know in second corinthians 11 13 14 it says for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of life yeah the second thessalonians to god it says even him who's coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders so is that a good test doing wonders and doing signs and and healing even in different places people are the the lame were made to walk and and different things the bills were uh people confessed that they were healed because you know when they heard a beatles song so how do you know in isaiah 8 20 it says to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in here that's the comparison nicodemus didn't have the sermon at that time now jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god he can't understand it he doesn't know what's going on he doesn't know this mystery of how god is invading himself he doesn't know how to get into the kingdom nicodemus sailing to him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus says verily verily i say unto me except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit of spirit now before we go into this a little deeper it's just beautiful how the contradiction between what nicodemus says and then what jesus is right and nicodemus verse two he says we know in jesus verse 11 he says that which we know we speak right then nicodemus verse two he says thou art a teacher and in in verse 10 jesus says ark now a teacher then verse three jesus said except god be with him and nicodemus and said and where forces accept the man be the nickname in verse four says how could a man be born right and christ says except a man be born right now nicodemus didn't even understand the concept of being born again but now jesus laid out the whole right here except the man be born of water and holy spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that's how we get in and that's how we move up right by water and my spirit right so what is the water now i remember i'm talking about an economy considered on god's word right and the economy moves us it places us the economy puts everything in the church in the right order it puts everything in our lives in the right order and it's placing everything the watching of the water of the word that's what it is right now i i didn't have this in my notes but go back to chapter two how the very first miracle that jesus does is to turn the water into the wine but look how he does it he says there's some empty vessels over there first you've got to be cleansed and those vessels have been purified by uh let's see how it says that after the manner of the purifying of the jews right contained two or three frequents apiece and these water pots have been set aside and then jesus said fill the water pots with water first you gotta be filled with the word filled and washed by the washing of the water and they fill them up to the brim and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feasts and they bear it now here's another example of where it looks like jesus is not doing the work but the servants were the ones that were drawing out the water the servants were the ones that took the walk the wine and took it to the to the the people at the feast but it was jesus behind the scenes and you know maybe you look at this little scene right here and think nothing's going on but god is doing something man that's right brothers go ahead and put that quote up the you must be born again 1961 to uh paragraph two of seven now remember now remember i believe that jesus christ says this to every human being on his first doctrine except the man be born of the water that's the word washing of the water by the word and of the spirit which is the holy spirit the holy spirit confirming the word he cannot see the kingdom of heaven right now do you believe that sea of the water washing of the water by the word word and truth he is the truth water and spirit the spirit coming with the word to confirm the word making god live in me see we cannot understand the kingdom of heaven till that's happened right then when that begins to happen that we see the word in us born of the word of the spirit manifesting itself leading me not away from the word the spirit leads me to the word and the word living in me making god manifest in your life you'll never understand the kingdom of god and can no lies enter into it god bless you now there's the whole plan the whole the god expressing itself and how is he expressing himself by building block on top of block word on top of the word and then his spirit coming to make it alive so you gotta eat keep reading and eating until his word is made manifest in him and then you see virtue and then you see temperance and patience in your life manifesting you by the watching the water of the word right like sister shepard's dream that the the word just bubbling up and watching out everything from the inside all the all the the antichrist all of the stuff that don't conform with his word it's pushing it all out and uh in john chapter 7 verse 37 jesus said in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried now am i imagine seeing that the day of the feast and then somebody in the back stands up and cries out with a message jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink amen he that believeth on me is the scripture i said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water amen you begin as the water just gushes up within you you begin everything everything falls into place right you don't you don't wonder about things so much right everything begins to become alive paul said i have begotten you through the gospels james 1 18 says of his own will beget all his own will beget yes with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of these creatures in first peter 2 1 23 says being born again not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever then now we've got to keep reading the story the wind blows where it listed right and now here is the sound thereof that can't not tell where's it cometh and whether it goes right so is everyone that is born of the spirit amen that's a very mysterious scripture how how is the wind like somebody that's born of the spirit first of all you go out on a windy day and you stand there and you say i'm gonna stop the wind put your hand up and say stop right you can't stop it it's an immovable force right the wind is sovereign it's beyond your control right you get out there and say there's a tornado that's coming by and say stop tornado and get yourself in the way you're gonna get hurt real bad and you know the wind is irresistible like a tornado that comes through and it tears down everything in its path right you let the wind of god come in your life in the holy spirit it'll start tearing out all your prejudices and all the all the unbelief in your life and all your uh unloved for your brothers and sisters that tears down all your rebellion and all your opposition all the antichrist doctrines and things in your life it's an invisible force that moves it you know you look out in this building and see all the faces but behind the scenes god is moving just like when he was instructing the servants to pour the water and to scoop out the wine right they had to serve it right it's something moving behind the scenes and and it's invigorating right because it brings life right loretta so moving on we've got a rushing mighty wind that was experienced on the day of pentecost they were all in the upper room now remember picture this they were all in the upper room around and a little economy around god's word because god had told him to go right with terry until you're ready with power from ohio and now as he tells it one of them might have rose up and said well we've already got it and then peter maybe stood up and said hold on now he told us to wait let's move the center of our economy back to his word right they tried to get it off he moved it back right hold on now and then a rushing mighty wind that invigorated him and filled in with the power of god and you know they ended up out on the street now who let them out on the street right i don't think anybody said well i think we should leave now and go out on the street you know they the door opened up and they staggered out and before long they found they were on the street and god was speaking out from inside of them and you know i don't believe that peter really understood before he was in need for power on high how to get into the kingdom right but after that happened he went down the street he said i'll tell you how to get in repeat and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and he gave him the word and they received it and the spirit quickened it and they were filled with the power of god and baptized into the body and you know god put in the church and economy they began moving and ordering things he put a five-fold ministry and they put ministries into the church you know just because i'm just because you're not up here it doesn't have you know brother talked about uh uh how there might be somebody in the church that's praying and fasting right for somebody over here to catch the endeavor right now everybody has something to do i think i think a lot of times the things that are unseen are greater than the things that are seen you know we don't see the ones in here that are praying and fasting at night praying on saturday night for a good church service or praying for one another that god would uh heal one another and minister to one another but we don't maybe a lot of times he doesn't see that but god sees it man that's who we're doing it for we're uh we're doing it for him you know the bible says myself and uh you know that baptism in the holy ghost that economy got a hold of a little man named paul who his economy he thought he was going in the right direction he had his economy over here on uh well we need to kill these people because they're not believing and one day he met the pillar of fire and god shifted his center of his economy onto the word onto the right way right and the things that paul thought were true uh he realized that he was going in the wrong direction it turned into 180 degrees around you know what the first thing paul did was he started looking in the word and he went into the wilderness for three years and the word reflected back on him and it just the the word and the spirit world type of word spirit clicking in it and making it alive to him and by the time he came out of that wilderness he was ready to go and he spent two weeks at peter's house making sure that he was on the right track right the way he went right because paul had he had become part of this economy centered on god's word and you know i was i was reading about how brother branham's talked about how that your your your whole salvation god had pre-planned it and ordained it and and just planned everything out he planned it for paul to meet that pillar fire because he knew he would receive it he planned for you to be here today because you knew you'd receive it right right and uh he ordered paul's sentences around his word and that's what he does to us when we're filled with the holy ghost you start looking at things differently right but first you know abraham got just a little bit of taste in that spirit and he started ignoring his eyesight now i don't even care what i see anymore because i know one day i'm gonna be holding a little baby and uh you know paul started ignoring his reason right by his own reason and by his imagination he can look in the word and say well i i'm right i should be killing these people because they're not believing what the old testament prophet said but when he got when that economy of god got into him he it it moved it moved his senses just like that solar shift the sun moved jupiter to planets around an orbit around the sun you remember one day joshua he was fighting the battle and he was fighting battle with the king of jabez which jesus was the name of jerusalem before it became jerusalem and uh he he needed a little bit more time and the word of god inside of him just spoke out and he said uh he said son you ain't still having a good bed and moving your hands to state to stay still over agilent because i need a little bit more time everything stood still for a whole day because god's word has spoken out from within when god's word moves your senses it'll put everything just in line perfectly around his word maybe not all at once but as the washing of the water word moves up and moves up things begin to fall you know uh i'll wrap up in just a minute here but god uh he he he you know bro brown preached his sermon or the series of sermons conduct order and doctrine right now conduct order and doctrine built around uh positioning us and moving us placing he moves us he places his people he places his church he places your senses everything around the economy of his word and then the last the last thing i want to talk about is just moving right on down is your family because if you don't have god in your home and i talked about this a little bit at the valentine's day banquet but if you don't have got it in your home then things will not be placed right right and i'm not gonna meddle or anything but but uh god in your home you know take time to pray with your family and put god first because you know the devil will try you know all these little stories we told about how the devil would try to move your center the center of your economy yeah from off of god's word on something else he tried to do that with the children of israel by moving it off of the god's word manifested into stones he moved it onto the golden calf and moved it from god's word with eve waiting on god's word he moved it to the the word of the beast and he'll move your focus in your home if you if you don't watch out you'll move it with this layout of spirit let's see in spirit moving in and encroaching and trying to get things out of balance trying to get you off the center the his word is a sinner his word and we don't have that in our in that in our home it'll just be like solomon's temple without an anointing right it'll be uh we'll just be beating our heads against the wall like the scripture says then joshua 24 14-16 it says now therefore fear the lord and serve him in its sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of flood and in egypt and serve you the lord and if it seemed evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the god was your father sir they were on the other side of the flood of the gods of the amorites and whose land you dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the lord all right and the people answered and said god forbid that we should forsake the lord to serve other gods now i i just want to finish up brothers if you go ahead and put up that first quarter way to jesus 1963 wrap it all up by going back to that wheel in the middle of the wheel yeah program 225 nebuchadnezzar threw three hebrew children in the fire furnace that believed in god and stood on his word if they had to die for it was going to stand anyhow just a little thing of bowing their knees some other way but when he looked away and saw jesus he was the fourth man that was in the fiery furnace and it kept all the heat off of his obedient servant that's what nebuchadnezzar saw right ezekiel looked away to see him one day and he was a wheel in the middle of the wheel way up in the middle of the air he was the hub to the wheel whatever he spoke is fascinating amen the big will run by faith but the little will turn by the power of the lord that's who ezekiel saw when he looked away let's go to the next one verse our paragraph 62. that brothers musicians you can go ahead and be coming i'm just finishing up navy kanaz will one day have done an evil thing he threw three believing children into the fire first and when he opened the door to see how they were getting along in there he saw the fourth man on the inside of the face and what did you see when you look at nebuchadnezzar he said he looked like the son of god that's what he saw when he when he looked into a crime that he had done that was one that looked like son of god ezekiel took a look one day he said i saw him too and he was a wheel in the middle of the wheel turning up in the middle of the air right that's what he looked like to ezekiel and the last quote we're in the last days and the last hours of the days now you see him now and his word and all of his word made manifest right here before us old church of the living god get to your feet believe him with all the sin you hold that little wheel in the middle of the wheel let it stabilize every move and every motion that you make every thought that you have may be controlled by this tower on the inside of you because god is sitting right in his word of this hour in the evening light showing forth the lightning right right amen y'all believe that amen yes sir what do you have for us uh amen something great wheels thank you right now oh we always say to you when you come here one time you're a visitor after then you're just part of us because we don't have anything here to join we just have a fellowship as a brother we're talking about we just have a little group of people gathering together to believe in the word of god it's the economy of god but we say to you welcome let's sing one more florida yeah anybody have a name oh i've been born again is oh that's what they are um we are family thank you oh
