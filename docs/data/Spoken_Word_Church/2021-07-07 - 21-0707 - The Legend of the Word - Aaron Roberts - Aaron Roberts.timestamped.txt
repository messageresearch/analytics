[24:43] and it says then the pharisees and
[24:45] scribe asked him
[24:47] why walk not thy disciples according to
[24:50] the tradition of the elders
[24:51] but eat bread with unwashing hands
[24:54] he answered and said unto them
[24:58] well has elias says
[25:01] prophesied of you hypocrites as it is
[25:03] written this people
[25:04] honoreth me with their lips but their
[25:07] heart is far from me howbeit in vain do
[25:09] they worship me
[25:11] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[25:13] of men for laying aside the commandment
[25:15] of god
[25:16] you hold the addition of men as the
[25:19] washing of pots and cups
[25:20] and many other such like things you do
[25:23] and he said unto them full well you
[25:25] reject the commandment of god
[25:27] that you may keep your own tradition for
[25:30] moses said honor thy father and thy
[25:32] mother
[25:32] and whosoever curseth father or mother
[25:36] let him die of the death but ye say if a
[25:37] man shall say to his father or mother
[25:40] it is corbin that is to say a gift but
[25:43] whatsoever thou mightest be profited by
[25:46] me
[25:47] he shall be free and ye suffer him no
[25:50] more to do
[25:50] ought for his father or his mother
[25:53] making the word of god of none effect
[25:55] through your tradition
[25:56] which ye may that ye have delivered
[26:00] and many such like things do ye
[26:03] and unto and when he had called
[26:07] all the people unto him he said unto
[26:09] them hearken
[26:10] unto me every one of you and understand
[26:12] there is nothing
[26:13] from without a man that entering
[26:17] into him can defile him but the things
[26:20] which come out of him
[26:21] those are they that defile the man if
[26:24] any man have ears to hear
[26:27] let him hear amen amen god bless you
[26:29] night you may be seated
[26:33] have a have a little odd
[26:36] title tonight entitled this the legend
[26:40] of the word
[26:43] and
[26:47] the the dictionary
[26:52] list the word legend as a non-historical
[26:55] or unverifiable
[26:56] story handed down by tradition from
[26:58] earlier times
[26:59] and popularly accepted as historical
[27:03] it also means the body of stories of
[27:06] this kind especially as they relate
[27:08] to a particular person group or clan
[27:11] or it also means a person who is the
[27:13] center of such stories
[27:16] so when we look at the word the word
[27:19] legend
[27:20] and and speaking of this you know jesus
[27:23] was speaking to them
[27:26] of their their tradition of the
[27:28] scripture
[27:30] because when they when they saw the
[27:33] when these the pharisees saw the
[27:35] disciples and he said you know they
[27:36] didn't follow the
[27:38] the law as it was handed down which was
[27:41] not
[27:42] what moses gave them but it was added on
[27:44] to
[27:45] it was the tradition of the the elders
[27:48] that they done these things
[27:50] and he said why is it they don't follow
[27:52] this tradition
[27:54] you know brother branham said he said
[27:56] that one of the things that
[27:57] was about the the pharisees he said they
[28:00] were very
[28:00] zealous of their creed he said they were
[28:04] very zealous of their tradition
[28:07] and you know when we when we look at uh
[28:11] people that they get so wrapped up in
[28:13] tradition
[28:15] of things and you know just like you
[28:17] know people they
[28:18] they have these um these stories in
[28:21] their families and
[28:22] you know one of the one of the things
[28:24] that you hear a lot of people talk about
[28:26] a lot in
[28:27] in the world is you know you'll hear
[28:28] people that talk about well i i got so
[28:30] much
[28:31] of uh of this uh bro
[28:35] uh group or you know a lot of people say
[28:37] well i'm
[28:38] i got so much american indian in me you
[28:40] know i got so much cherokee in me and
[28:42] i've got this and i've got that and
[28:43] you know but now in the time that we
[28:46] live today
[28:47] people do dna tests and as they begin to
[28:51] do these dna tests
[28:53] it comes to find out as they do a dna
[28:56] test
[28:56] there ain't no indian in them or people
[28:59] have
[29:00] or people have a prejudice against a
[29:02] certain type
[29:03] of uh nationality
[29:07] and people come to find out is like this
[29:09] one man he didn't like french people
[29:12] you know he just had this thing about
[29:14] the french he didn't well he come to
[29:16] find out when he done his dna test he
[29:18] was like eight to ten percent french
[29:21] well you know and it's so funny because
[29:23] you get wrapped up in these things and
[29:25] people have prejudices
[29:26] and and all these things and come to
[29:28] find out you know we're in that boat
[29:31] and just like just like the pharisees
[29:32] you know here they are they're so
[29:34] wrapped up in this tradition
[29:36] that they believe this tradition is the
[29:38] word and they hold to this
[29:40] but then when the when when jesus come
[29:43] to speak to them of the word
[29:44] then they couldn't receive it because
[29:46] they were so bound by their tradition
[29:48] that he said he said you teach for the
[29:50] commandment of god the tradition of men
[29:53] he said here you are treated taking
[29:55] these things and he said you know
[29:56] you're so zealous of these things but
[29:58] when somebody comes to bring you the
[29:59] truth
[30:00] he said you can't see what the truth is
[30:03] you can't see what how the how the word
[30:05] of god is
[30:06] because you know as jesus told them and
[30:08] so many times you know
[30:09] he began to express to them who he was
[30:12] you know his
[30:13] head was to identify who he was because
[30:15] you know all the way
[30:16] because they so many times the pharisees
[30:18] stood up and said
[30:19] you know our our father is abraham and
[30:22] moses brought us the law
[30:24] and all these different things but then
[30:25] when jesus turned around and brought the
[30:27] law back to them
[30:28] to show them what the truth was then
[30:31] they couldn't
[30:32] they couldn't stand with it and they
[30:34] hated him so much that they were willing
[30:36] to kill him because they couldn't stand
[30:39] with the word
[30:40] but you know they wanted to hold to a
[30:42] tradition
[30:44] they had their own idea of how things
[30:45] were supposed to be
[30:47] you know brother brown talked about how
[30:49] you know how the
[30:51] uh when the messiah was supposed to come
[30:55] you know here here they are when when
[30:57] when the law came and it was supposed to
[30:59] have the messiah come well you know all
[31:01] the all that the jews looked at
[31:04] when they when they saw the messiah when
[31:05] they read the old when they wrote the
[31:07] old testament they read the law
[31:08] when they began to look at what the uh
[31:10] old testament was to
[31:11] what the messiah was supposed to be all
[31:14] they could see was a ruler coming in
[31:16] power and glory that's all they could
[31:18] see was that he was supposed to take
[31:20] over and rule the nations
[31:22] but they couldn't see that he was
[31:24] supposed to come
[31:25] as a lamb he was supposed to come as a
[31:28] babe
[31:29] that was supposed to come as a sacrifice
[31:32] as a gift but they couldn't see that all
[31:35] they could see was
[31:36] the the rulership that was coming they
[31:38] were coming to see the dominion that was
[31:40] going to take place
[31:41] and yet when they began to see and even
[31:43] when they prophesied
[31:44] of john coming and when there was
[31:47] supposed to be a messenger
[31:48] come before my face when he was supposed
[31:50] to come they couldn't see
[31:52] that because it was supposed to be these
[31:53] great things that were supposed to take
[31:55] place
[31:55] and yet they missed it why because they
[31:58] didn't see it because
[31:59] their their idea of what was great was
[32:01] not god's idea what was great
[32:03] so they didn't come the way that god
[32:05] that they got because what they thought
[32:07] was great god's called foolish
[32:08] he know well you know this is this is
[32:10] not the way it comes but he wanted to
[32:12] come
[32:12] in in humbleness and and simplicity but
[32:14] they missed it when they come that way
[32:17] and you know they say but we we have to
[32:19] see how god has to come
[32:21] and that's the way god works is to be
[32:22] coming in simplicity and and humbleness
[32:26] and they miss these things because you
[32:27] know they wanted all the pomp and
[32:28] circumstance and all the different
[32:30] things that
[32:30] that they call for that you know that's
[32:32] the way that they lived their lives
[32:35] why because they wanted somebody to look
[32:36] at them they wanted somebody to notice
[32:38] them
[32:38] and you know that wasn't that wasn't the
[32:41] idea that jesus had
[32:43] but he come to be a servant that's right
[32:46] amen
[32:47] and you know here they hear they come
[32:48] you know they were looking for something
[32:49] that something great was going to take
[32:50] place
[32:51] but yet when when jehovah came jehovah
[32:53] came and he was
[32:54] born over a manure pile right that's
[32:57] right
[32:58] when he come he he was born low and
[33:00] nobody nobody had any time for him
[33:03] when he began and he began to express
[33:06] even even when you go back and hear
[33:08] hear these disciples and even herod and
[33:10] all the different ones
[33:11] here they are but here here's the every
[33:13] time god is not without a witness
[33:16] god always has a witness to what's
[33:17] taking place because even
[33:19] even when when here come here come mary
[33:22] and she began to speak of these things
[33:24] and you know here she was she held it
[33:26] within her heart but you know she
[33:27] nobody wanted to believe that mary was
[33:29] the one
[33:30] why because there was so many that were
[33:33] better educated
[33:34] that come from better backgrounds had
[33:36] had better prestige in their
[33:38] family and it all automatically it would
[33:40] have had to be one of them
[33:41] that god would have called that would
[33:43] have had the virgin to conceive
[33:46] it would have had to be one of them who
[33:48] would have been the high priest daughter
[33:50] or somebody else that was fancy or
[33:51] whatever
[33:52] but it couldn't have been some lowly
[33:53] woman like mary
[33:55] why because she didn't have the pedigree
[33:57] that we expected
[33:59] that's right right brother and then when
[34:01] even
[34:02] when she did rest you know conceived
[34:05] then everybody was like well you need to
[34:06] stay away from her because you know
[34:08] because they did not even believe that
[34:10] it was her
[34:12] and you stay away from her because you
[34:14] know she's a bad she's a
[34:17] woman of ill repute yeah
[34:20] she's not any woman to have anything to
[34:23] do with
[34:25] but they missed god in everything
[34:28] but when it when he came even
[34:31] even here that here they are in this
[34:33] situation
[34:34] and you know they begin to speak and
[34:36] nobody wants you know so many that
[34:37] didn't believe that
[34:39] yet here come the wise men hear these
[34:42] wise men come from far away
[34:44] and begin to begin to speak and say
[34:48] where is he that was born king of the
[34:50] jews because even when the shepherds
[34:52] came from the field
[34:53] because the angels had come and
[34:54] announced the birth of jesus
[34:56] they came in and said you know we have
[34:58] heard because the angels in the heavenly
[35:00] host have spoken to us
[35:02] and here we are to come and worship the
[35:04] one that was spoken of of the scripture
[35:07] but you know most people still didn't
[35:08] believe that because they thought well
[35:09] that's just a bunch of old cranks coming
[35:11] out of the field
[35:12] but they didn't realize that they had
[35:13] had an angelic visitation
[35:16] in their day but nobody believed that
[35:18] but you know those men stood up and they
[35:19] were a witness
[35:20] to that day and then when the wise men
[35:23] came
[35:24] and those men had watched all those
[35:26] years and seen what was going to take
[35:27] place
[35:28] why because that had been written in the
[35:30] scripture been written in the sky
[35:31] and those men had studied all their
[35:33] lives to know what the scripture said
[35:35] why because he wrote this walk the bible
[35:37] in the heaven so when the commons began
[35:39] to speak
[35:40] they knew what was taking place so when
[35:41] they began that journey they knew where
[35:43] they were going
[35:44] and who they were going to meet and when
[35:47] he began to speak to them on that day
[35:49] yet they didn't see that they didn't
[35:50] they didn't recognize that he was there
[35:52] in their midst
[35:56] where is he that's born king of the jews
[35:58] where is he
[35:59] here he is that they came to look and
[36:00] they offered gold frankincense and
[36:02] mirror speaking of who he was
[36:04] and people still didn't see it
[36:08] and even when mary began to bring him
[36:11] into the temple that
[36:12] day to have him circumcised and we know
[36:13] that simeon the lord had spoke to simeon
[36:16] and told him what was going to take
[36:17] place and yet
[36:17] nobody believed it nobody believed that
[36:20] when it had taken place
[36:21] here with simeon's talent said i'll not
[36:23] depart until i see the lord's christ and
[36:25] then he stood and took the child
[36:27] and he said you know now your servant
[36:29] can depart in peace for my eyes have
[36:31] seen the salvation
[36:32] amen right and then the prophet the
[36:35] prophetess anna began to speak and speak
[36:37] of what was going to take place and
[36:39] prophesy over his life and people still
[36:41] didn't see what was taking place
[36:42] and there he was in the midst
[36:47] and so here he is when he began to speak
[36:48] the whole time his whole life
[36:50] was was the fulfillment of the word but
[36:52] yeah they they held on to their
[36:54] tradition they held on to their own
[36:56] concept of what the scripture said
[36:57] and he stood there and he told them he
[36:59] said search the scriptures
[37:01] while we kept taking them back to the
[37:02] scripture to show them he said he said
[37:04] in them you think you have eternal life
[37:06] but they are they that testify of me
[37:08] show me where i have failed the word all
[37:10] right right but yet they didn't still
[37:12] didn't see who he was
[37:18] but we just want to hold on to our idea
[37:21] of the word
[37:25] many people just holding on well this is
[37:28] what this is what mama said about it
[37:30] this is what daddy said about it is what
[37:32] the preacher said about it
[37:34] that's what greer's almanac says about
[37:36] it
[37:37] but they don't but they don't go try to
[37:39] find out for themselves
[37:42] why because they don't want to have they
[37:43] don't they don't take the time to come
[37:45] and get an experience
[37:46] for themselves why because if you've not
[37:48] had an experience you're not going to
[37:50] know these things
[37:51] it takes an experience of the baptism of
[37:54] the holy ghost it has a new birth and
[37:55] without that you'll never get anywhere
[38:02] all the way through the scripture that's
[38:04] what what has happened see
[38:06] god god comes so simple
[38:09] it was missed yes even from the
[38:12] beginning satan
[38:13] satan's always got his work and he
[38:14] always tries to make something better
[38:17] brother abraham said that you know what
[38:18] he's talking about eve
[38:20] when he began to speak to eve when the
[38:22] serpent began to speak to evil into
[38:23] something that was great or something
[38:24] bigger something more wonderful
[38:27] and she missed that he was hebrews 13 8
[38:30] amen
[38:31] that it was the simplest thing it was so
[38:33] simple
[38:35] and that's what god wanted us to see
[38:36] that it was just so simple
[38:39] but you know that's what that's what we
[38:41] have to see that is it's so simple
[38:43] and it takes it takes not our sight but
[38:45] it takes his side
[38:47] we have to have his eyesight to see
[38:49] these things because we can't see them
[38:51] in ourselves many times we miss those
[38:52] things
[38:54] all the way through the scriptures when
[38:55] they begin to speak and jesus had to
[38:57] turn back around and speak to them and
[38:59] tell him these are the things that's
[39:00] taken place
[39:01] when he began to speak to him about john
[39:03] c they kept looking for elijah and he
[39:05] told them look
[39:05] elijah's already come right when he
[39:08] began to expel
[39:09] express that to him oh that was john
[39:12] well they missed it
[39:14] well you know the same thing in our day
[39:15] many times people have read the
[39:17] scripture they've looked at the
[39:18] scriptures
[39:18] they've read the books they've listened
[39:20] to the tapes but you know if it doesn't
[39:22] take if it's not the holy ghost that
[39:23] comes to you
[39:24] to quicken it to you then people miss it
[39:27] it takes the holy ghost
[39:30] that's right we have brother brahm
[39:32] talked about he said we have a map
[39:38] he talks about this is from the message
[39:41] god has provided
[39:42] as a provided way and he's talking about
[39:45] the highways he said
[39:46] you know the highway department has has
[39:47] maps and it has all these little
[39:49] things along the way he said has
[39:52] he has a highway provided you just
[39:54] follow the highway get them out follow
[39:56] the highway
[39:57] it's very easy to go anywhere in the
[39:58] united states just by getting a highway
[40:01] map
[40:02] he said god has a map marked for your
[40:04] healing for salvation and a mountain
[40:05] marked for glory
[40:07] it all leads that way and while we're
[40:09] traveling this grand ole highway
[40:11] if we need a place for healing you'll
[40:13] notice on the map
[40:14] there's a little there's little stations
[40:16] all along the side of the road
[40:18] where the lord has provided for us a
[40:19] healing place he has ministers
[40:22] all down along the road and he that that
[40:25] believes in divine healing and they pray
[40:27] for the sick and needy and then brother
[40:30] brown continues on about
[40:32] uh the
[40:36] the good samaritan you know helping the
[40:38] man to the to the end
[40:40] and help pay for him and bind him up
[40:42] with everything he says
[40:43] but he said but when you become a
[40:44] believer then all these things shed off
[40:47] and it's a new life of belief
[40:49] and it produces righteousness peace joy
[40:51] love long suffering goodness patience
[40:53] gentleness that's the attributes because
[40:56] you're a believer now
[40:57] god he said did you ever stop to think
[41:01] now just a little bit
[41:05] that let's just look straight at the
[41:07] scripture and i love it
[41:08] because it's god's pathway it's god's
[41:10] righteousness and all these things that
[41:12] happened back in the old testament was
[41:13] an example
[41:14] of what we can be if we take the same
[41:18] thing
[41:18] or the road that they did
[41:22] so we go back and we look so i want to i
[41:25] want to look at two things here tonight
[41:26] because you know
[41:27] there's a legend of of
[41:30] the stories and and just you know seeing
[41:33] these things
[41:34] as stories and you know um
[41:37] these people that that people put up on
[41:39] pedestals and
[41:40] you know brother i'm talking about
[41:41] william tale you know he shot an apple
[41:43] off the man's head till he went overseas
[41:45] and realized
[41:45] that never happened and you know
[41:47] everybody you know brother brown said we
[41:49] uh the world know all the kids they all
[41:50] they all know about davey crockett and
[41:52] all these people and you know
[41:53] and he said you know they you know all
[41:54] the great stories that they told about
[41:56] daniel boone and all of them and half of
[41:57] them are not true
[41:58] but you know they were so wrapped up he
[42:00] said they don't know who jesus christ is
[42:02] but he said they knew all about these
[42:03] legends and stories
[42:05] but the thing is is you know people
[42:07] people look and see well that's just a
[42:09] story
[42:10] you know it was just something mama told
[42:12] me that's something granny told me
[42:14] but the thing is is you know it's got to
[42:15] be a truth to you it's got to be
[42:17] something that's real to you it can't be
[42:18] just a story it just can't be a fable
[42:20] because like peter said he said we've
[42:21] not been we've not been led by cunningly
[42:24] devised fables
[42:25] but he said we were eyewitnesses to
[42:26] these states so we
[42:28] when we take these things you know it
[42:29] just can't be a legend as
[42:31] a story or anything but the thing is it
[42:33] does have to be a legend to you
[42:38] and i don't know if y'all if y'all know
[42:39] this or not but there's another word for
[42:41] the
[42:41] for legend the word legend also means a
[42:45] table
[42:46] or a map chart or the like listening
[42:48] explaining the symbols used
[42:51] he says he said it also means like the
[42:54] word key
[42:55] also fits in this a systematic
[42:57] explanation of abbreviation symbols and
[43:00] such using dictionaries maps
[43:02] and everything like that so there is a
[43:04] legend that can be used but it's not the
[43:06] legend where
[43:07] you think that you know it's just a
[43:08] fable or just some story
[43:10] but you actually read those things
[43:11] because what brother ram said he said
[43:13] these were examples to us because it
[43:15] unlocks the truth to us
[43:17] so it shows us the truth and the death
[43:19] shows us the day and hour that which we
[43:21] live
[43:22] but you know that's the reason when we
[43:23] go back to the scripture and we're
[43:24] looking to see
[43:25] the day and hour which we live when god
[43:27] looks and
[43:28] to our day when we see the things that
[43:30] took place what he
[43:32] had to take had to do because of the
[43:34] scripture that what the scripture told
[43:36] us would take place
[43:36] then we realized we had to have a
[43:38] prophet in our day we had to have
[43:40] because all the way through the
[43:41] scriptures he had he had prophets that
[43:44] came
[43:44] he had messengers that came and the one
[43:46] thing that they done was they always
[43:48] identified the error of the day
[43:50] and they brought the truth for their day
[43:52] so there had to be somebody in our day
[43:53] why because
[43:54] it was the same all the way down through
[43:56] history people looking and saying
[43:58] well you know this is what mama said is
[44:00] what daddy said this is what
[44:01] all these different people said but yet
[44:03] when we go back and look
[44:04] you know we we have to apply this to
[44:06] ourselves and it has to be a personal
[44:08] relationship with us we have to see it
[44:10] as a personal
[44:10] experience but when we take these things
[44:12] and it's not what somebody else said but
[44:14] when we begin to look into the scripture
[44:16] and you begin to read it for yourself
[44:17] and you wait for the lord to come to
[44:18] speak to you then he shows you things
[44:20] along the way
[44:21] and some things will pique your interest
[44:22] and you'll say why did he say that
[44:26] when he said that then all of a sudden
[44:28] then you begin to search for the answer
[44:30] they had a question
[44:31] and all of a sudden you'll find out why
[44:32] is it why is it that when people catch
[44:34] things and they say well they don't make
[44:35] sense
[44:37] right there's people that read in the
[44:39] scripture and they say
[44:40] here's matthew 28 19 there's acts 2 38.
[44:45] why is that well i don't make any sense
[44:50] or people stand there and now listen to
[44:51] somebody argue trinity and
[44:53] one god and they'll say well one
[44:54] scripture say this and one scripture
[44:56] says that
[44:56] and they wonder why what's the deal well
[45:00] god's not an author of confusion
[45:02] exactly so then here they are they're
[45:04] arguing over these things well so then
[45:06] all of a sudden
[45:06] they begin to search these things
[45:09] and then people people have simple
[45:11] questions like why did god use angels in
[45:13] the old testament but he didn't use
[45:15] angels today
[45:19] well if he's the same if he speaks why
[45:21] did he use angels then but not now
[45:25] so there's so many questions that people
[45:26] catch all of us and why because people
[45:28] are looking for themselves
[45:32] but see if you're so bound by your
[45:34] tradition
[45:36] just like just like when when jesus held
[45:39] the healed the blind man
[45:40] you know his his mom and dad you know
[45:42] they didn't want it he's of age
[45:43] let him answer we know we're not getting
[45:45] involved in this
[45:47] why because they were so bound by their
[45:48] tradition
[45:51] why because they were so bound by a
[45:53] system that they weren't going to
[45:55] we're not getting involved in this why
[45:58] because we we don't want to rock the
[46:00] boat we don't want to stir no water we
[46:02] don't do nothing because we're just
[46:03] going to flow along why because
[46:04] we don't want to be kicked out
[46:08] but you know if if they had actually sat
[46:10] down and began to look at what the
[46:11] scripture had to say
[46:12] and took for themselves then they would
[46:14] say well you know this is what the bible
[46:16] says
[46:18] amen who would who could who could heal
[46:21] but god
[46:23] amen is there is there any place because
[46:26] the scripture the old testament even
[46:28] psalms and all this
[46:29] all the throughout the old testament the
[46:31] law tells us all the word tells us
[46:33] that only god can heal
[46:37] well a miracle took place in our midst
[46:39] then who done it well they weren't going
[46:42] to challenge they weren't going to
[46:43] challenge the pharisees on that
[46:44] why because it was something but you
[46:45] know he stood up and said hey you know
[46:47] what i was blind
[46:48] and now i see and he said i don't know
[46:51] who it was
[46:52] but he said i know who spoke to me and
[46:54] he told me
[46:55] he said i could receive my sight now he
[46:57] said i did i believe what he had to say
[46:58] and i received my sight
[47:01] he said well if y'all are supposed to be
[47:02] so religious and you're supposed to be
[47:04] the greatest
[47:05] the great religious leaders of our days
[47:07] and why don't you know who he is
[47:09] why are you asking me because if you're
[47:11] supposed to be the ones that god talks
[47:13] to you're supposed to be
[47:14] the the one that's the extension of god
[47:16] on the earth so why don't you know who
[47:18] he is
[47:20] why is it why is it that i'm the one
[47:22] that's trying to tell you
[47:24] well you can't listen to him because
[47:25] he's he's he's got a devil
[47:29] well he's got enough of god to do
[47:31] miracles
[47:33] but if you're so if you're so anointed
[47:34] if you have so much then why can't you
[47:36] do it right
[47:38] why can't you do these things but you
[47:40] know here
[47:41] so you know he took what what he hadn't
[47:44] because he believed what what happened
[47:46] and he said well these are the things
[47:47] that i know what took place
[47:50] and so as jesus began to do these
[47:52] miracles he began to show who he was
[47:55] and he began to speak to different
[47:56] people and then they had a witness of
[47:58] who he was one because they had an
[48:00] experience with him
[48:01] so when they began to speak to these
[48:02] things they stood up and they began to
[48:04] speak of their experience
[48:07] and so you and i we have to have the
[48:08] same experience you know we have to
[48:10] stand up
[48:10] and and declare what our what our
[48:12] experience is what god has done for what
[48:14] we have seen in our day one because
[48:16] there's so many people
[48:17] that's out there that's either
[48:18] wishy-washy or they have turned and
[48:20] completely walked away
[48:22] but you know what god has called us to
[48:23] be eyewitnesses of these things
[48:25] he has called us to be representatives
[48:28] of this message in this hour
[48:29] to stand up and claim what god has done
[48:31] for us
[48:32] we're not we're not we're not ashamed of
[48:34] the gospel of jesus christ
[48:36] i'm not ashamed of the gospel that has
[48:38] been brought i'm not ashamed to stand up
[48:40] and say that my prophet is brother
[48:41] branham
[48:42] william because you know what because i
[48:44] begin to look in the scripture and i
[48:45] begin to see who i am
[48:47] and i can see where i'm standing and you
[48:48] know what came through or came forth
[48:50] from this from the scripture so i know
[48:53] what was said so i can stand behind that
[48:55] and have confidence in what god said
[48:58] well nobody else is going to be able to
[49:00] tell me out of why because they didn't
[49:02] talk me into it
[49:08] i'm not i'm not ashamed of it
[49:12] and you you know just like brother brown
[49:13] i'm talking about you you try to talk to
[49:15] some people and you can't
[49:18] you can't help some people
[49:22] you know he was talking about the doctor
[49:23] and he said you know here here comes
[49:25] here comes a man
[49:26] that's sick and he needs something oh
[49:28] yeah
[49:29] and he you know he comes oh doctor i'm
[49:31] so sick he said what's wrong he said
[49:33] he said when was the last time he ate he
[49:35] said well i ate half a cracker the day
[49:37] before yesterday
[49:40] he's like well what's your problem is
[49:41] you're hungry
[49:43] you're not going to make it unless you
[49:44] eat
[49:47] so what what what is the prescription
[49:49] the prescription is to eat
[49:50] right right and just just like just like
[49:54] you talked about the
[49:55] the doctor the man come to the doctor
[49:57] he's like well i'm sick i need something
[49:59] he's like well you know he said right
[50:00] inside here is the medicine well he can
[50:02] sit on the man
[50:03] he said on the doctor's doorstep and die
[50:05] he gets so close but he can't get all
[50:07] the way
[50:07] he can only get so far but he's not went
[50:09] in all the way to the place but you know
[50:11] the doctor
[50:12] can stand on the doorstep have the door
[50:13] open but until that man decides that
[50:15] he's going to come in and receive
[50:17] then you know he can't do anything for
[50:18] him
[50:22] why because in our day many times people
[50:24] the door has been opened
[50:27] well because not only because we have
[50:29] received the word in our day
[50:31] we have received a key and just like
[50:33] brother i'm talking about then the key
[50:34] to the door you know the door is there
[50:35] and you've been given the key he said
[50:37] the scriptural key
[50:38] he said it's the key of faith he said
[50:41] you got to go and unlock the door but
[50:42] the door is before you but you've been
[50:44] given the access to it
[50:45] but the problem is you've got to go you
[50:47] can't wait for somebody else to do it
[50:49] for you
[50:50] you've been given the opportunity
[50:59] god has called us into a a place
[51:03] god wants us to receive what god has
[51:06] for us but you know we've got we've got
[51:09] to do what god wants us to do to do that
[51:14] you know i was thinking about brother
[51:16] brother altic the last time he was here
[51:18] and
[51:18] and yet you know he was talking about
[51:21] the about manna
[51:23] you know many people talk you know when
[51:24] you're talking about
[51:26] having a need and and you know people
[51:29] you know his brother i'm talking about
[51:30] the man
[51:30] you know he needed to eat
[51:33] he was he was starving to death that was
[51:35] his whole problem but
[51:36] you know there was the talk about the uh
[51:40] the children of israel when when god
[51:41] rained down manna for him
[51:44] you know he he give them he give them
[51:45] exactly what they had need of
[51:48] sure but you know what people didn't
[51:51] like it
[51:53] right you know his brother brother oltek
[51:55] was talking about you know when
[51:56] when the matter came you know he said it
[51:58] was divine and somebody it was divine in
[52:00] origin
[52:01] but the problem was is when people got
[52:03] it you know they want to argue you know
[52:04] they want to examine this
[52:06] right yeah and by their own tradition
[52:08] their own idea
[52:10] well you know i don't think god would do
[52:11] it that way
[52:14] now why would god you said that it
[52:16] rained down from heaven
[52:18] then why did it then why'd god let it
[52:20] pass away
[52:23] if it was divine then why didn't it stay
[52:26] amen here it was that you know it came
[52:30] down
[52:30] and then if you just left it and you
[52:32] didn't go get it
[52:34] then it disappeared
[52:37] well i don't think god would do it that
[52:38] way well that's that's
[52:40] that's just doesn't just make any sense
[52:42] to me
[52:44] well it's not supposed to make sense to
[52:46] you because you're trying to use a
[52:47] finite mind to understand an infinite
[52:49] god
[52:50] so when when the when the word came why
[52:52] because it was a daily gathering of the
[52:54] food
[52:55] so it's just a type of type of a
[52:58] spiritual walk
[52:59] you can't you can't just rely on
[53:00] yesterday's experience
[53:02] you can't rely on on last week's
[53:04] experience but it has to be a daily
[53:07] experience to take place it's a daily
[53:09] eating of the word
[53:10] and so when he said you know they come
[53:12] out there and they gathered that
[53:14] food well if they followed god's plan it
[53:17] had nutritional value to it
[53:20] they fed and he said he said they didn't
[53:22] get weak
[53:23] they didn't get old everything that they
[53:26] had need of was in that
[53:28] all right so they were perfectly healthy
[53:31] and whole by eating what they had
[53:33] because god gave it to them but you know
[53:35] if they didn't go out there and get it
[53:37] there was nothing for them
[53:39] and the other thing is is if you tried
[53:40] to hold that over
[53:42] you couldn't hold that over until
[53:44] because it didn't become spoiled
[53:47] and so you could only accept the what
[53:49] the food that god had given the manna
[53:51] that had been given
[53:52] in a specified time in a specified way
[53:56] because you couldn't do it any way you
[53:57] wanted to you had to do it the way god
[53:59] said do it amen except for
[54:02] except when he told him he said you got
[54:04] to go out and get a double portion
[54:06] yeah because the sabbath was coming on
[54:08] and they had to go get a double portion
[54:10] well then that stayed but you know you
[54:11] couldn't hold that beyond a certain
[54:13] period of time right so here it was
[54:16] they were able to gather the metal but
[54:18] they had to gather it when god told them
[54:20] to
[54:22] but there was one time that the manna
[54:24] never failed
[54:26] it never ruined when god told them
[54:29] he said now listen he said you go and
[54:31] gather the manna
[54:33] and you got this omer of manna and he
[54:35] said you go take it into the holy of
[54:37] holies
[54:39] here's here's a gathering of this and
[54:41] it's set up in the holy place
[54:43] and then when it was there then he said
[54:45] when the new priest came in he said they
[54:48] were invited and they had a right to
[54:51] taste the manna
[54:52] that fell in the wilderness and it never
[54:55] ruined
[54:56] and so see there was a specified time
[54:59] when god had all this laid out
[55:01] and so you know we have been given as
[55:04] brother
[55:04] oltek said we've been given a seed in
[55:06] our day we've been given a word in our
[55:08] day
[55:09] and he said it's the message of the hour
[55:12] and so when we receive this message
[55:14] then we can eat on it any time we want
[55:16] to amen
[55:18] we have a message that we can feed on
[55:19] all the time why because we can
[55:21] we can read and we can listen to it all
[55:23] the time it's it's available
[55:25] but the problem is is and then we can we
[55:28] can we can
[55:28] sustain our life through that but the
[55:31] problem is is
[55:33] when we get outside of god's plan then
[55:36] it has no nutritional value to us
[55:38] when there's only one thing see when you
[55:39] get beyond using when you begin to use
[55:42] this
[55:43] manner when you begin to use this manner
[55:45] in a way that god didn't prescribe to
[55:47] use it
[55:48] when he said when we want to take tapes
[55:50] and we want to bypass
[55:51] a five-fold ministry then all of a
[55:53] sudden then you're ruining
[55:55] the nutritional value of the manna
[55:57] because god didn't plant it that way
[55:59] and you you can't have a christian walk
[56:02] you can't be strengthened
[56:03] you can't go in this journey if you're
[56:05] not going to follow it the way god
[56:06] gave the man just like they had to
[56:09] follow the manna the way god prescribed
[56:11] it in the old testament and the same way
[56:12] today
[56:13] we have to follow the way god gave us
[56:15] the word exactly what god
[56:17] gave us in this hour if you're going to
[56:18] make a rapture if you're going to make a
[56:20] body change
[56:21] then it has to come the same way because
[56:23] there's no way that you're going to live
[56:24] on wiggle tells
[56:25] and make it all right
[56:30] why because god gave us away he gave us
[56:32] he gave us a plan on what to follow but
[56:34] the thing is is you've got to believe
[56:35] that that's what god gave you
[56:37] you've got to see it as yours
[56:44] many people just want to walk and they
[56:45] just see it as a tradition
[56:48] yeah that's right i don't see it as a
[56:50] tradition
[56:52] i see i see it as a way that all of a
[56:54] sudden because many times we read the
[56:56] scripture when we see these things that
[56:58] many people have probed in the scripture
[56:59] and they've looked at things in the
[57:00] scripture
[57:01] and they've not understood them and
[57:02] people come up with all kinds of ideas
[57:04] and everything but you know what it took
[57:05] god coming why because he promised that
[57:09] he would come through
[57:09] through malachi 4 that he would come and
[57:11] bring a prophet
[57:12] that he would come and all these things
[57:15] all the way down through time they had
[57:16] they had truth there was truth all the
[57:19] way down through time
[57:20] every every one of the other messengers
[57:22] all every church age had their truth why
[57:24] because he said they had a
[57:25] he said they had a chance had a revival
[57:27] he said a chance at the word
[57:29] so each each age had a word each age had
[57:31] a revival but the problem is in our day
[57:34] and then it was the bringing is the
[57:35] culmination of all these things
[57:38] not because all the things that took
[57:39] place in the past now it's come to our
[57:41] day to see the fulfillment of these
[57:42] things
[57:43] to see the fullness of god's plan to
[57:45] realize that god what god has done all
[57:46] the way down through time
[57:48] why because in the in the past they
[57:49] didn't understand these things
[57:51] they didn't understand them in the old
[57:52] testament but when john began to express
[57:55] who
[57:55] jesus was and began to express what was
[57:57] going to take place then when jesus came
[57:59] on the scene
[58:00] then he could stand there and look back
[58:01] and he could tell everything that isaiah
[58:03] and jeremiah and ezekiel and all the
[58:05] rest of them had said was exactly the
[58:07] fulfillment of what the day was
[58:08] but they didn't see it why because it
[58:10] didn't look the way it should have
[58:11] looked to them yeah that's right
[58:13] that's right and say it's the same way
[58:15] today we don't we don't see why because
[58:17] you know we don't expect
[58:19] to look the way it does or things
[58:21] haven't happened the way it
[58:22] would think it ought to happen and you
[58:24] know if god was on the move things would
[58:26] be better
[58:27] or you know all these different things
[58:28] but you know we understand it in this
[58:30] day
[58:30] we know it's going to be a battle it's
[58:32] going to be hard it's going to be why
[58:33] because the greatest battle ever fought
[58:35] was in the mind
[58:36] and everything that you have have a
[58:38] preconceived idea the devil's going to
[58:39] shoot you full of something
[58:41] to try to hinder you to hold you back to
[58:43] quote for you to question everything
[58:45] along the way
[58:50] we're going to have to fight all those
[58:51] different things why because it's not
[58:53] going to it's
[58:53] because you know we're human beings
[58:55] we're going to see certain things a
[58:56] certain way
[58:57] we're going to wish things come a
[58:58] certain way we're looking at things and
[59:00] hoping things would happen this way
[59:02] but it's not and many times many things
[59:04] come our way and we wonder why
[59:06] why it came this way and why has it
[59:07] happened or happened to me this way and
[59:09] why is it
[59:10] so so bad looking why is it why is all
[59:13] these things why because god
[59:15] is molding us we know these things are
[59:18] going to take place we know we got to
[59:19] face these things why because you know
[59:21] what but you know no matter what the
[59:22] devil brings our way whatever god allows
[59:24] us to come
[59:25] whatever comes our way you know more
[59:26] than conquerors through him
[59:28] that loved us but whatever comes our way
[59:30] we're overcoming
[59:32] we can overcome these things why because
[59:36] he said that there would be a bride that
[59:38] wouldn't fall
[59:41] i'm so glad see it's not it's not me i
[59:44] can't i can't do it in myself
[59:47] i can't i can't do it but i know
[59:50] that he has right
[59:54] and he takes the word and it takes the
[59:56] word
[59:57] he takes a revelation of the word for
[1:00:00] him to
[1:00:00] to reveal the word to us and if we
[1:00:03] receive the
[1:00:04] revelation of the word then we can see
[1:00:06] what god has done for us
[1:00:14] message this is the
[1:00:17] key to the door brother rem says he said
[1:00:20] therefore i believe in the full gospel
[1:00:21] every word of god that turns the power
[1:00:23] of god loose
[1:00:24] that turns his blessings to the people
[1:00:26] it's the key to the door that
[1:00:28] unlocks it all those great heroes those
[1:00:30] prophets and great men of the bible
[1:00:32] they had that key that's the reason they
[1:00:34] could stop the mouths of lions quench
[1:00:36] the violence of fire escape the edge of
[1:00:38] the sword bring back
[1:00:40] bring the dead back to life again and do
[1:00:42] all kinds of miracles is because
[1:00:44] they held that key they knowed it worked
[1:00:46] because it was a scripture-born key
[1:00:50] he said if i'm programming with a creed
[1:00:52] key i don't know
[1:00:54] what's going what it's going to do he
[1:00:56] says they say my church speaks this
[1:00:58] i don't know about that but when the
[1:01:00] bible teaches it and i hold the key
[1:01:02] the faith key in my hand or in my heart
[1:01:04] that says that's god's words
[1:01:06] that'll quench the violence of fire
[1:01:08] it'll unlock healing for the sick it'll
[1:01:10] unlock salvation to the lost
[1:01:12] i have to come to the door everything's
[1:01:15] in his name whatsoever you do and word
[1:01:17] or deed
[1:01:17] do all in his name knowing that the key
[1:01:20] that you got
[1:01:21] is faith because it's a scripture made
[1:01:24] key
[1:01:24] and if it's a creed's key a
[1:01:25] denominational key i don't know what
[1:01:27] it'll do
[1:01:29] but if it's a scriptural key it'll
[1:01:31] unlock because god said so
[1:01:33] right oh no no wonder
[1:01:36] they could stop the violence of fire and
[1:01:38] so forth they had the key
[1:01:41] so we've received the key because we've
[1:01:44] received
[1:01:45] the message and so the key that we
[1:01:47] received
[1:01:48] or we've ex we've received
[1:01:51] this this past this legend that we can
[1:01:54] understand what the scripture has to say
[1:01:56] so there's a way to unlock these things
[1:01:59] because you know
[1:01:59] many people you know they got a map and
[1:02:01] they pull out the map and they're
[1:02:03] looking at the map
[1:02:04] and they're saying well this is what god
[1:02:06] said but then when you start to try to
[1:02:07] figure out how to get somewhere
[1:02:08] they don't know how to get there you
[1:02:11] know it's just like somebody pulling out
[1:02:12] a map and
[1:02:13] and looking at it and it's like we know
[1:02:15] where we're supposed to be well i don't
[1:02:16] know
[1:02:17] how do we how do we define where we're
[1:02:19] at
[1:02:20] yeah and then and then when they start
[1:02:23] looking oh well here's here's the here's
[1:02:24] a spot on the map
[1:02:25] and it and it says this this is lula
[1:02:28] it's like okay so where do we need to go
[1:02:29] from here
[1:02:30] it's like well you follow the blue road
[1:02:32] up here
[1:02:33] and then the red road goes off to the
[1:02:35] left
[1:02:37] yeah and it's like well how do you
[1:02:38] where's there's no road that's blue
[1:02:42] but they're looking but they're looking
[1:02:44] at the mouth well i'm reading you i'm
[1:02:45] telling you what the map says
[1:02:48] but there's no way to see that until
[1:02:52] until you have a way to identify what's
[1:02:54] in the map until you identify what's in
[1:02:56] the word
[1:02:56] then you don't have any idea what it
[1:02:58] says
[1:03:00] and so many people get up and you know
[1:03:02] one person gets up and and they say well
[1:03:04] you know
[1:03:05] uh you know i i wish i wish that they
[1:03:07] they believed in uh
[1:03:10] you know healing i i know i know you
[1:03:13] know
[1:03:14] it says that but you know i just i just
[1:03:16] don't know if if that
[1:03:17] actually works and it's like well you
[1:03:20] know i've never seen anybody get healed
[1:03:24] and you know you know the bible tells me
[1:03:27] you know
[1:03:27] and i hear and i hear and i've seen it
[1:03:29] in the bible people talk about it
[1:03:31] they say you know if you want to get
[1:03:33] blessed he said he said if you would if
[1:03:34] you'd bring your ties into the
[1:03:36] storehouse
[1:03:37] he said you know if you'd pay tithing
[1:03:40] then you know
[1:03:41] god said he'd bless you
[1:03:45] and you know people well i don't know
[1:03:46] anything about that
[1:03:48] and so so the so they they see these
[1:03:50] things until somebody comes along and
[1:03:52] begins to speak
[1:03:55] just like that ethiopian eunuch you know
[1:03:57] he was standing there and he was
[1:03:59] speaking
[1:03:59] he's like uh is he speaking of himself
[1:04:02] or somebody else
[1:04:05] well somebody that had an experience and
[1:04:07] knew what was then he began to take the
[1:04:09] scripture and begin to express
[1:04:11] salvation to him or who jesus christ was
[1:04:14] and what jesus christ came to do
[1:04:17] right amen and many people they they've
[1:04:20] heard these things that are in the
[1:04:22] scripture but you know they're looking
[1:04:23] for somebody
[1:04:24] to manifest it too i know what it's like
[1:04:28] i know what it's like to be lost i know
[1:04:30] what it's like to be found
[1:04:32] i know what it's like to be blessed i
[1:04:34] know what it's like to be healed
[1:04:37] i know what god has done for me i know
[1:04:38] where god's brought me i can tell you
[1:04:40] what
[1:04:40] and so when people begin to say well i
[1:04:42] don't know about these things well let
[1:04:43] me tell you something
[1:04:44] let me let me tell you share your
[1:04:46] something with you come on
[1:04:49] and sometimes that's what god wants us
[1:04:50] why because people have heard a lot of
[1:04:52] things
[1:04:52] and you know but they've not seen the
[1:04:54] truth
[1:04:56] right and as brother ram said there's a
[1:04:58] lot of mockery
[1:04:59] there's a lot of uh fake
[1:05:04] so so we see a lot see a lot of things
[1:05:06] that are that are not true
[1:05:08] and people get get uh discouraged they
[1:05:11] get hindered by these things and they
[1:05:12] say well
[1:05:13] i wish i knew somebody that was that
[1:05:15] where it was true this these things had
[1:05:16] actually taken place
[1:05:21] so when we not not only do we have it's
[1:05:23] not just a
[1:05:24] standing up and describing something or
[1:05:26] telling something
[1:05:31] but it's for us to be so filled with of
[1:05:33] the spirit
[1:05:38] you know when you begin to live the life
[1:05:40] in front of somebody
[1:05:41] that you know when somebody because
[1:05:43] there's a lot of people they don't they
[1:05:44] don't care they they
[1:05:45] they just walk around with blinders on
[1:05:47] it doesn't it doesn't affect some people
[1:05:51] you know because the the the life of
[1:05:54] jesus christ they're not looking for it
[1:05:57] but you know there's some out there that
[1:05:59] are looking they are seeking
[1:06:01] that you know because people say you
[1:06:02] know where is it where is god
[1:06:04] you know where is where is it where the
[1:06:06] like it says in the scripture
[1:06:09] just like just like brother talk about
[1:06:10] that that man somebody
[1:06:12] you know they were looking for a
[1:06:14] christian they said well i'll show you a
[1:06:15] christian let's go home i'll show you my
[1:06:17] wife
[1:06:19] he's like well you know they thought
[1:06:21] they had some well we we
[1:06:24] mom and daddy talked about all this and
[1:06:26] you know we've sat in a church and we've
[1:06:27] heard the preacher preach
[1:06:29] we've seen a lot of things but you know
[1:06:31] what we've never seen a lot the life of
[1:06:33] jesus christ made manifest we've never
[1:06:35] seen it take place
[1:06:36] i've never had an experience with it but
[1:06:39] all of a sudden when they came to that
[1:06:40] place then you know what
[1:06:41] it become a time when they went in there
[1:06:44] you know he
[1:06:44] they all acted drunk and you know acted
[1:06:47] the way they did you know she
[1:06:48] he threw all his stuff on the floor and
[1:06:50] you know he said just watch this
[1:06:52] and they went outside and she was in
[1:06:54] there singing and cleaning that mess
[1:06:57] and they began to see the life of jesus
[1:06:59] christ made manifest in her
[1:07:01] it's like you know what that's a real
[1:07:02] christian
[1:07:04] amen when you when somebody's looking
[1:07:06] for something
[1:07:07] and they see that they see somebody's
[1:07:09] life it's it's not it's not that you try
[1:07:11] to preach somebody a sermon is so that
[1:07:12] you live somebody a sermon
[1:07:14] can you lift somebody a sermon can you
[1:07:16] live something before somebody
[1:07:18] and you know and then let us let us be
[1:07:19] so molded into his character into his
[1:07:21] image that the world can see
[1:07:25] i want to show the world that he lives
[1:07:29] not not just that that we talk about it
[1:07:33] i want to i want to show the world that
[1:07:34] he lives
[1:07:36] that he is he is here today the same as
[1:07:39] he was back then to do the same thing
[1:07:43] but many people are they question these
[1:07:46] things and
[1:07:47] they say well you know what i've heard
[1:07:48] these things and i've seen things but
[1:07:53] you know if you can show somebody
[1:07:56] brother brown said just be salty let's
[1:07:59] be salty
[1:08:00] he said if we'd be salty he said you
[1:08:02] know he said then you know
[1:08:04] they'll get a thirst one because they'll
[1:08:07] see something that's true
[1:08:09] god god has revealed this message to us
[1:08:12] that we
[1:08:12] may spread the light to the world that
[1:08:14] shows these things
[1:08:17] and i believe that you know we have
[1:08:19] received the truth in our day we've
[1:08:21] received the life
[1:08:24] the light has come from the from the
[1:08:26] messenger
[1:08:28] because i believe it was scripturally
[1:08:30] vindicated
[1:08:32] this word was scripturally vindicated to
[1:08:35] show us who who brother branham was the
[1:08:38] lord
[1:08:39] and it's not it's not making brother
[1:08:41] branham anything that's right right no
[1:08:42] but it's identifying the word
[1:08:45] what the scripture says
[1:08:48] it doesn't make you and i anything but
[1:08:50] it identifies what the scripture says
[1:08:52] it identifies him in the word that jesus
[1:08:55] is the same
[1:08:56] and when we see that the messenger has
[1:08:58] come then he said
[1:09:00] he said it spread the light he said
[1:09:03] brother brown said in the in the smyrna
[1:09:04] church age he said in every age we have
[1:09:07] exactly the same pattern
[1:09:08] that is why the light comes through some
[1:09:11] god-given messenger
[1:09:12] in a certain area he said then from that
[1:09:15] messenger there spreads the light
[1:09:17] through the ministry of others who have
[1:09:20] been faithfully taught
[1:09:22] that's right so that's the reason why
[1:09:24] it's so important to have a pastor
[1:09:26] why because you've got to be taught
[1:09:28] absolutely why because
[1:09:30] it has it has to be taught to us because
[1:09:32] that's way
[1:09:33] that's the way it comes because he told
[1:09:35] it it would come through a five-fold
[1:09:36] ministry
[1:09:37] for the perfecting of the saints so when
[1:09:39] we have to say we have to have
[1:09:41] those that have been faithfully taught
[1:09:42] there is a ministry and everybody says
[1:09:44] well it's just one ministry well we're
[1:09:47] just looking at brother brandon well he
[1:09:49] said there would be
[1:09:50] other ministries that were faithfully
[1:09:52] told that would do the exact same thing
[1:09:54] in every age when he began to speak of
[1:09:57] the
[1:09:58] uh the the voice of many waters
[1:10:02] he said he said it's the voice of the
[1:10:04] ministers in every age
[1:10:07] so then there has to be a fivefold
[1:10:09] ministry that has been faithfully told
[1:10:11] under the prophet's message that she
[1:10:14] that this fivefold ministry began to
[1:10:16] sound and then through the 5-0 ministry
[1:10:18] as the hey begins
[1:10:19] as they begin to sound then the work
[1:10:21] we're not doing away with what the
[1:10:23] prophet had to say
[1:10:24] why because you still receive from the
[1:10:26] message
[1:10:27] but see it also has to come through the
[1:10:29] five-fold ministry through the
[1:10:30] perfecting
[1:10:31] that you begin to sound also that you
[1:10:34] begin to show forth the word that you
[1:10:36] begin to speak
[1:10:37] also it's not just the well because
[1:10:39] everybody says well we know
[1:10:40] what brother branham is and we and you
[1:10:41] know we know the five-fold ministry and
[1:10:43] we'd say well you know i've got behind
[1:10:45] my pastor brother dale and i'm just
[1:10:47] going to stay right here
[1:10:49] come on well god didn't call you just to
[1:10:51] stay right there
[1:10:52] all right well because we have to go on
[1:10:55] from here
[1:10:56] we've got to go on so there's a call not
[1:10:59] just to stay in one spot and say well
[1:11:00] you know i've reached it
[1:11:03] god didn't god didn't call us to lula
[1:11:07] god called us to the word
[1:11:10] god called us to the word he didn't call
[1:11:12] us he didn't call us to be
[1:11:13] lulaites he called us to the word he
[1:11:16] called us to be christian
[1:11:18] he called us to be the bride of jesus
[1:11:20] christ
[1:11:22] amen so we've received these we received
[1:11:26] the word in our day
[1:11:27] amen and the word is to be we're brother
[1:11:30] rem said that he said we have been
[1:11:32] invited to be molded into his image
[1:11:36] we have been invited absolutely you know
[1:11:40] god's a gentleman so we've been given
[1:11:44] this
[1:11:44] that we can receive the word amen
[1:11:47] and follow what god has has for us what
[1:11:50] god has for us
[1:11:52] brother brown says in here in the smyrna
[1:11:54] church age he said he that hath an ear
[1:11:55] let him hear what the spirit saith to
[1:11:57] the churches of every age
[1:11:58] he said in every age it was the same cry
[1:12:01] hear what the spirit says
[1:12:02] if you're a christian you will get back
[1:12:04] to what the spirit
[1:12:06] is teaching that is the word of this age
[1:12:09] every messenger to every age will preach
[1:12:11] that word
[1:12:13] every fresh and true revival will be
[1:12:15] because men
[1:12:16] it's the very last one brother if i've
[1:12:18] got it
[1:12:22] because men have gotten back to the word
[1:12:24] for their age the cry of every age is
[1:12:27] the rebuke you have left the word of god
[1:12:28] repent and come back to the word
[1:12:30] for for the from the first book in the
[1:12:33] bible genesis to the last book
[1:12:35] revelation there is only one reason for
[1:12:37] god's displeasure
[1:12:38] leaving the word and there is only one
[1:12:40] remedy to regain his favor
[1:12:43] back to the word amen let's come back to
[1:12:46] the word
[1:12:51] many times people say well brother
[1:12:52] brother aaron i i'm in the word
[1:12:55] yeah but you know things aren't the way
[1:12:58] they used to be
[1:13:04] we need it's high time we check and see
[1:13:05] why exactly
[1:13:08] that's right you know if you feel
[1:13:11] if you feel cold in the lord and you
[1:13:12] wonder why the lord don't speak to you
[1:13:15] the way he used to
[1:13:17] like that old saying is is you can
[1:13:20] guarantee
[1:13:21] who the one that moved yes
[1:13:27] because god didn't move
[1:13:30] you'll know that you were the one that
[1:13:31] left right
[1:13:35] and then go back to find where he's at
[1:13:36] you've you've left your first love
[1:13:39] that's right you've left the word
[1:13:41] let's go back to the word let's find our
[1:13:44] place
[1:13:44] and let us lord let us just be what
[1:13:48] you'd have us to be less
[1:13:49] let's be on fire let's move forward
[1:13:52] right now i want i want because god has
[1:13:55] brought something
[1:13:56] that no it's so amazing but what god has
[1:13:59] brought to us in our day
[1:14:00] god has brought us the word amen right
[1:14:04] all the things that people have probed
[1:14:05] at and questioned and all these things
[1:14:07] and
[1:14:07] and people are leaving the message
[1:14:09] because they stand there and they say
[1:14:10] well
[1:14:10] you know we've stood around all this
[1:14:12] time and we've listened to this and
[1:14:13] we've listened to that
[1:14:14] and we still you know all and they got
[1:14:15] questions about this and brother brown
[1:14:17] said this and their brother around said
[1:14:18] that
[1:14:18] that's right well the problem is is they
[1:14:21] don't have the key
[1:14:24] it's just been fables to them it's just
[1:14:26] been words to me
[1:14:29] but you know what brothers sisters we
[1:14:30] have the opportunity to have the one
[1:14:32] that wrote this scripture
[1:14:33] come and uh reveal the word to us
[1:14:38] so is a legend why because the
[1:14:42] scripture has been laid here the
[1:14:44] scripture didn't change
[1:14:46] all through all through history the
[1:14:48] scripture didn't change
[1:14:51] but it took somebody with supernatural
[1:14:53] vision
[1:14:55] that could hear from god that he could
[1:14:57] speak
[1:14:58] that's right and when he began to hear
[1:15:01] from god he began to speak
[1:15:02] and he began to look into the scripture
[1:15:04] and he began to bring these things out
[1:15:06] and show the truth of what was what was
[1:15:08] written in there
[1:15:10] yeah and as it began then it became a
[1:15:13] brand new book it wasn't it wasn't just
[1:15:14] denominational guesswork
[1:15:16] it just wasn't some idea from man
[1:15:20] like well you better leave that book of
[1:15:22] revelation alone no
[1:15:25] no god has begun to reveal these things
[1:15:30] you know is god coming on a white cloud
[1:15:32] he's coming on a white horse
[1:15:34] you know is god going to do this or god
[1:15:36] going to do that
[1:15:38] how's how's all these things going to
[1:15:39] take place
[1:15:42] you know why why is there
[1:15:45] three and a half years or is there seven
[1:15:48] all these different things there are all
[1:15:49] these different questions that people
[1:15:51] have
[1:15:53] they said well brother brown said this
[1:15:54] brother said that
[1:15:56] well the problem is is you've got to get
[1:15:58] in the same spirit
[1:16:00] that he was in that's right and to see
[1:16:03] you know so many times people people get
[1:16:05] so hung up on things and you know
[1:16:06] then then they they try to they try to
[1:16:09] solve it themselves or they try to move
[1:16:11] forward or whatever you know stand still
[1:16:16] and know that he is god
[1:16:19] so well i don't understand this it may
[1:16:22] be years
[1:16:24] but you know the thing is is god wants
[1:16:26] you to keep walking
[1:16:29] when god told abraham hey listen you're
[1:16:32] going to have a son
[1:16:34] he said i'm going to visit you according
[1:16:35] to the time of life
[1:16:39] well when god told him that when god
[1:16:40] stood out there and told him said can
[1:16:42] you count the stars
[1:16:43] can you count the sand he said that's
[1:16:46] how your seed's going to be
[1:16:50] here's a man that's you know so advanced
[1:16:52] in age
[1:16:53] his body's failing him
[1:16:58] how is he going to do that but you know
[1:17:01] what
[1:17:01] he didn't he didn't tell him how
[1:17:02] everything was going to take place now
[1:17:04] that's what's going to happen
[1:17:05] you're going you're going to do this and
[1:17:06] you're going to go over here
[1:17:08] and then when this happens you're going
[1:17:10] to do that
[1:17:11] and then you know you're going to try to
[1:17:12] give your wife away and then this is
[1:17:14] going to happen and that's going to
[1:17:16] happen and you know all these different
[1:17:17] things god didn't tell him that
[1:17:20] but he told him to walk by faith he said
[1:17:24] walk in the land
[1:17:25] exactly walk in the land amen
[1:17:29] god didn't tell him that every little
[1:17:30] hiccup in the plan was going to be
[1:17:33] right even when god told him said depart
[1:17:36] from your family
[1:17:37] and go to a place that i'll show you
[1:17:39] that's right
[1:17:40] you know god didn't run out there and
[1:17:42] stop him say right
[1:17:45] i told you to go yeah that's right
[1:17:48] you got that fellow over here a lot you
[1:17:50] got to get rid of him
[1:17:53] no he let him go yeah absolutely
[1:17:57] but in time you know because god told
[1:17:59] him said listen you get away from your
[1:18:00] family
[1:18:01] and you go to the place it was a journey
[1:18:04] of him and god amen and when lot came
[1:18:08] along then you know what
[1:18:09] there was strife that built up and you
[1:18:11] know they had to go separate why because
[1:18:12] god that's what god told him to do in
[1:18:14] the first place
[1:18:15] to go your own way to go away not bring
[1:18:18] anybody else
[1:18:20] but as he began to walk then the more
[1:18:22] that he began to walk in the land
[1:18:24] as he began to journey and along the way
[1:18:26] then god began to speak to him some more
[1:18:28] and began to show him more things of
[1:18:30] what was going to take place
[1:18:32] but he didn't show him everything that
[1:18:34] was going to take place so as he began
[1:18:35] to walk and he began to see more things
[1:18:37] and he began to walk
[1:18:38] then he began to see more things and
[1:18:40] then god began to speak to him more
[1:18:43] yeah well you know what they didn't they
[1:18:45] didn't stop well you know what god's
[1:18:46] speaking to me all the time now
[1:18:48] i'm walking and you know what i don't i
[1:18:50] don't i don't
[1:18:51] see it anymore
[1:18:56] no he was still sinning
[1:19:01] as long as you're in this journey guess
[1:19:03] what you're gonna do the same thing
[1:19:07] and many times people people get they
[1:19:09] they'll get upset about things and
[1:19:10] and then you know some people some
[1:19:12] people get so condemned that they won't
[1:19:14] go any further
[1:19:18] why because they allow condemnation to
[1:19:19] hold them back it's like well i'm stuck
[1:19:23] well i don't know what i don't want to
[1:19:24] do now
[1:19:26] well god trying to talk to you well you
[1:19:28] know we get so we get so tired we can't
[1:19:30] listen to god speak because you know why
[1:19:32] because we're so tied up in our
[1:19:33] condemnation
[1:19:35] that's right just like lazarus we're
[1:19:37] wrapped up in grape clothes
[1:19:38] we're all bound up we're bound up in
[1:19:41] condemnation
[1:19:43] but you know what god's made a way
[1:19:46] and god begins to speak to you don't
[1:19:49] allow your condemnation to hold you back
[1:19:54] you know god don't god don't just
[1:19:55] overlook our sin
[1:19:58] but god will make an avenue for you to
[1:20:00] come back
[1:20:02] god will speak to you for you to come to
[1:20:04] him
[1:20:06] amen but it takes you to make that
[1:20:08] journey
[1:20:10] many people they get so bound by things
[1:20:13] that things that have happened
[1:20:14] and things in the past and they get so
[1:20:16] they get so worried
[1:20:18] or whatever they get so bound up with
[1:20:19] things it's time god's making an avenue
[1:20:22] he's calling for you to come out of that
[1:20:26] don't allow those things to hold you
[1:20:27] back and as abraham began to walk then
[1:20:30] god began to speak to him and as he
[1:20:33] began to speak to him then you know he
[1:20:34] reached a place
[1:20:35] where he had a body change
[1:20:40] even even then he didn't he didn't do
[1:20:42] everything right but you know what
[1:20:44] something took place and he began to
[1:20:46] walk
[1:20:49] he began to see that his old sins had
[1:20:51] been cast off
[1:20:53] he began to walk in newness of life
[1:20:56] it didn't make him perfect but you know
[1:20:58] what he began to walk in the word
[1:21:00] that god had given him see the thing is
[1:21:02] you and i we're not perfect
[1:21:05] but we have a perfect god we have a
[1:21:06] perfect sacrifice
[1:21:08] see god don't see us the way we see
[1:21:10] ourselves
[1:21:12] see we can begin to look at ourselves in
[1:21:14] the word why because he's unlocked the
[1:21:16] word for us to see who we are
[1:21:19] not to see ourselves
[1:21:23] when you begin to stand up and you and
[1:21:24] you begin to see that my sins are gone
[1:21:28] god took my sins and he placed them in
[1:21:30] the sea in the depths of the sea
[1:21:32] and the sea of god's forgetfulness he
[1:21:35] said never to be remembered again now
[1:21:37] you can remember your sins and everybody
[1:21:39] else can remember your sins and
[1:21:40] everything but thank god god
[1:21:42] don't remember our sins anymore god has
[1:21:44] brought us from that place so you know
[1:21:45] what there is no condemnation
[1:21:48] to them that are in christ jesus one
[1:21:51] because god is showing us that we are
[1:21:53] free from that
[1:21:55] to walk in newness to to walk from that
[1:22:00] the thing is is when we come to true
[1:22:02] repentance and we see these things and
[1:22:03] they drop off then
[1:22:04] we just continue on well we still carry
[1:22:06] things and we still battle these things
[1:22:08] but you know what god doesn't see us
[1:22:12] i want to walk the way god sees me the
[1:22:14] word
[1:22:15] through the light of the world that's
[1:22:16] what i want to see amen
[1:22:18] god bless you not let's all stand have
[1:22:20] the musicians come
[1:22:24] i want to sing that song we'll walk in
[1:22:26] the light
[1:22:27] the beautiful light
[1:22:32] why because we've received the word in
[1:22:34] our day and now it's time to walk in the
[1:22:37] light
[1:22:37] the light of that word
[1:22:40] why because now the word has been
[1:22:42] illuminated
[1:22:43] amen and if the word has been lightened
[1:22:45] to us that we can see then we'll walk in
[1:22:48] that light
[1:22:50] just just walk just like the brother i'm
