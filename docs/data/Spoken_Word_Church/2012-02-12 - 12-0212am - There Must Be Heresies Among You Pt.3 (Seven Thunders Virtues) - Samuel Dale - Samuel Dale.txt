TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh holy holy hope I the prophet of God said he invited everyone wanted to see God if his heart was right he would see that's right you see everybody in the house could have looting them back there wouldn't it all right good to see them yeah if I turn in these scriptures from where we've been reading in First Corinthians 11 and first Peter 3. now remember the fellowship meeting will be held here on the third Saturday in March which will be March the 17th the speaker is not announced yet that you know in another week or so but you just remember that now to pray for that we'll get everything ready all right I remember also now the to the uh married couples and things remember the band um the Valentine's banquet will be held this coming Saturday and what time are they supposed to start be there at six okay because from six to seven will be pictures being taken and then at seven o'clock we will be eating and Wade will be speaking uh there and so we we can eat while he talks amen that'll work out pretty good amen remember that remember brother brother give me down preaching for his brother today so remember that amen any other announcements I mean I generally missed something this First Corinthians 11 and first Peter 3. father we thank you we love you and we ask you to just do one thing this day Lord and that is to come Among Us and Lord be the preeminent one in each one of our hearts and lives as we try to talk about you as we try to talk about these things we ask you to have your way with us forgive us when we fail you and we know that we do and Lord we can only speak by what we have understanding and our ears to hear so we talk about these things we pray that you would just be with each and every one lowered all of those on the internet systems and things we ask you to just bless each one as we read your word and we study we pray that they would enter right into the spirit with us today and just be one with you have your way now forgive our sins and you promise to send your word that you sent your word and healed us so we believe you and we thank you we ask you to have your way now and keep us in Jesus name amen amen First Corinthians 11 verse 18 and 19. and first of all when you come together in the church I hear that there'll be divisions among you and I partly believe it for there must need must excuse me now for there must be heresies among you and it must be this guy comes right amen one God allows it to come to do what to test you and I you say well why would he let this happen why not to test you and I to see whether or not we're going to stay with a word amen all right so if then for there must be heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you all right we'll see who will stay with the word right amen and we'll go to First Peter 3. 15 let's sanctify the Lord in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word yeah we have started kind of a little series or part on talking about some of the doctrines among the people of the message and I am in no way trying to straighten out anybody I'm just trying to preach to you and the things that I see and and I put this trying to on each one that I know and realize that there are so many different versions that people have over doctrinal issues and I don't know every version but I'm saying that because there are a lot of people that have a lot of different versions and they as they do that they you know they don't wholly follow say one person with it they'll be different Sprout auction runoffs and things like that and to any of them that here then you just remember that I'm saying that according to what I've heard myself do I speak these things and then trying to show why I agree with it or do not agree with it you know it's that point but I want you to get that in your mind that you know it's not just one thing see and that's why I don't want to call names because that would put it in there's no need of it so you that would hear this you just remember it's your responsibility for your soul to be able to uh search out what's being preached to you or what you've heard or whatever that's up to you it's not up to me because I'm not in no way am I a pastor of anything other than the lunar congregation these are on internet that are with us and things uh this morning um you know that's your choice and and that way I'm not trying to straighten out anything other than preach here what I believe and the things that we stand for and we have you know new ones Among Us and things that we have just started covering some doctrines and if there's anything that you think of uh as we're going along we're going to be another few weeks about this and then Wade is going to be on uh marriage enrichment something like that family life me and so you know you don't have time to write them down and we can kind of ponder over them but if you know if you think of something and say well I heard a brother so and so what do you believe about this write it then I'll answer the best I can not to try to anybody we're out there you know there's another amount of business what anybody believes and I've always said if you can believe your big toe is God if you want to just don't expect me to worship it you know I'm just sorry that just me you know and I've always been blunt I think anybody's reading I read that to be able to give a reason and Hope that lies within you you know and the reason that I believe what I believe and if I cross a doctrinal issue you know of something that you don't agree with but just remember I I didn't know who all would be here today to sit here and if whatever would be listening on tape I'm not that don't have that much discernment so I just rang a topic bring a topic bring a topic and just cover that and we went through um last Sunday afternoon we covered the doctrine of the was called the two Soul doctrine that went for many many many years 40 years ago I guess close to it and came on down through this past Wednesday we did get to cover a couple of doctrines and we covered the doctrine of what is called the two Lords you know we covered that part and then we got into what most people would call the River Jordan doctrinal Point are those that believe that Jesus wasn't God until the River Jordan you know and you know so we covered those in trying to this state what we believe that's why we believed it and that's that's all right as I say whatever you believe that's between you and your God right it is not up to me I'm just trying to express what I believe all right now so what we're going to do today is to take one that was called and I told you now there's different versions so you know I'm just trying to stay with what I know from what I've heard myself if it's something of a Doctrine you ask me something I'll say well I haven't heard that one I'll be glad to tell you that but the things that I've heard and listened to and and some of these doctrines I have listened to um you know on this one on the the the seven tone diversary doctor and I listened to probably 10 or 11 tapes right in a row trying to understand what the person was saying because I want to do that I don't want to argue the point it's not to argue this message is not to be argued it is to be lived in our hearts and lives to bring Jesus Christ forth you know and all like that and uh but this there was a message started back years ago started back in the uh late 60s early 70s that was called more or less than seven Thunder virtue Doctrine all right now as I said there's many versions of that now so just get what I'm talking about and then don't call me and say well you're talking about no no I'm talking about what I understand what I heard myself as to be uh this we were happening to be in brother calling us was in making many years ago when the brother began to talk about the uh the doctrine of the seven Thunder virtues and back at that time they had the uh uh talking about how Henry Aaron knocked the Home Run and and brought everybody in and all these others at loaded the bases up and and then the the uh a chiropractor doctor he preached that you had seven um what you call them in your neck it was many different thoughts about it that was brought out but the basic thought that as far as I could fall and understand words that they were saying that the the Thunders were the virtues of second Peter you know Faith virtual knowledge tempers patience not in this brotherly kindness and Etc and then turning out to be loved and uh you know they said there was was seven this that was the seven thunders in other words that Thunder number one now I'm telling you this now because see there's different versions so get that but the basics of what I heard and understood to be saying that like thunder number one was virtue number one number two with virtue number two and that was why it was called the seventh under virtue virtue whatever how you pronounce it uh doctrine that was uh you know brought in and uh you know there were some things that I try to bring out even something natural all right to where you can look at something and say well well you know uh this some people can't count and they don't read right you know and and I'd like for you if you would to go over of course you'll put it up on the thing uh go ahead brother pull up second Peter and I want you to look real close because that's why I said for me to just get up here and say well what do you believe by yourself I don't believe it well there was a lot in there I didn't really and you know a lot of the things that you do believe about this and that's not an answer to a question right that's diverting from the fact that you have an answer yourself you know I heard it's about a meeting they had one time and they called a certain brother and he was supposed to sit down you know and and uh you know he just got up and he said I agree with that brother well everybody said that brother's right well nobody hadn't heard it what their brother even believed you know and nobody didn't know it just that man's word you know and I don't think that works but now get what I'm saying that of my understanding of what they were saying was the seven Thunders were the seven virtues of second Peter now I want to ask you a simple question if you look at second Peter then you will see wait a minute they got to say up here too bring it down to one yeah back up the chapter brother I may have wrote that down on the thing but I'm sorry but I just carried that in there a moment ago and tell them to bring it up they'll they'll get if you don't look in your Bible you can you can get it and and uh they'll pull it up in just a second does it real good at that I probably wrote it down on the wrong thing so a contract proper opinion I'm not always perfect you know I make a lot of goof UPS you know I don't mind admitting I give up but you know but the Lord will take care of it okay now if you're looking in second Peter though the point I want you to get is if you're gonna have Seven Virtues all right and then where are you going to start with faith you're looking in your Bible you will see that if you said well okay we'll start with second Peter because it says there if I add to your faith furniture all right then you would have Fae virtue knowledge Temperance patient godliness brotherly kindness and charity and something went wrong there because mathematically you've missed it that's eight right amen now we can all see it back here if you count it Faith see one two three four five six seven eight so how where are you going to start see and people don't listen to that they just come up with a Doctrine virtue number one would be faith you know to what the doctrine was virtue number two would be Thunder number two you know well then you would have seven Thunders and you don't have the headstone see if you make this if you see what I'm talking about if you start off Faith you so Faith number one is virtue number one because that was the group of people of Paul's day because the reason I know they emphasize real heavily that they were uh thousands and I'll give you the quote in a minute thousands of Little Voices thundering out brother Brown says but a word in other words for the age and time all right and see then that's what I'm saying you look at things and you say well brother you're just too technical well I have to be technical if I'm going to line up things in the right order amen right Joy as you're looking at it see if faith is a virtue then you would have faith versus knowledge temperamentation you'd have eight okay and that would make you mathematically missing it all right and brother Reynolds said on a message I didn't give you this one so but I'll give you where it says it's paragraph 217 God's only provided a place of worship uh 65 11 I guess it's 1109 or 29 but run around said there's seven ads all right so if you add virtue knowledge temperatures you'd have eight ads that you're mathematically missing it I mean that's just point number one say people don't pay close enough attention to what the Bible says they just take what somebody says and they say well that sounds good and you just lump it out and that's what a lot of preachers do instead of looking at the thing you know from the the point of seeing the pyramid seeing looking at it see if you made Faith number one to try to make sure that you would get Paul and his group of people into the Little Voices then you're going to wind up and have no headstones for the church and run around says there's seven halves all right so do you you know what I've taught you and what we believe I don't believe faith is a virtue right faith is a birth right amen that's right man right it's not a virtue it's a birth itself it's Christ birth in you all right amen your birth by faith you're saved by faith everything you get from God you comes by faith amen all right so now if you take and make not vert not Faith they virtue see then you can add and you'll be right so then you have seven ads see virtue number one would be thank you I got two three four five six seven right you're coming out right you would have seven eyes but see mathematically you would miss it because you're dealing with the wrong thing faith is not a virtue right faith is at Birth that's right the virtues are like uh characteristics right um whatever you would bring a baby when it's born is born again at Faith right in the body of Christ the new birth all right and the baby has ever part not much something goes wrong unless something goes wrong the baby has every part when it's born a normal baby has everything you know fingers toenails fingernails higher you know the only thing you don't have his teeth we're glad of that but they're back up in there right that's right they just think push down all right let's see then you take then you've got seven abs so you got seven virtues which you would start not with faith right that's virtue number one you would start with virtue amen see one two three four five six seven are you mathematically correct that you're dealing with it in a total different realm because see their point was and I'll get to that as I said in a moment the point was that that there were thousands of Little Voices thundering out and I agree with that amen because down through the church ages the people were thundering out the voice of God that's exactly right man they were the voice of God that's how he was thundering out that was what he was doing was to those people but yet that wasn't the seven Thunders amen because the seven Thunders was not brought about until the prophet of God came into view and began to talk about the seals amen right and the things and as he began to talk about it see then he would bring out what a thunder is and that away then he would come up and he'd say those seven Thunders were the revealed in the seals right amen all right you see the basic doctrine that they were using as I'll get to it in a second read it is that the thousands of Little Voices was a 1960 quote yeah right I'm 63 where the seals were broke that's right the prophet didn't know what those Thunders were nope he's like all of us he thought he did all right but he didn't know you agree he didn't know what the seals were that's right amen and we'll show in just a moment what it is the center is the voice of God the prophet said when the seal breaks that's right now there's a connection to the virtues it will get to the lights of the message and bring it back right but that's the connection is because then we can see where it goes but you see you know you can go into debatable and arguments about the people that brought those doctrines how that really they were saying you don't know what it is until I tell you what it is that's right that's it you know and I'll tell you when you got virtue number one yeah number two because I'm 30 days okay and I have a problem with it because we used to uh my wife and I would be listening and he'd say uh you know brother so-and-so when you first got engaged real dick you remember when you and Gail got engaged long time ago then he'd say uh and brother you remember when you got married um yeah you remember when you consummated your wedding and your you become forth with a family and the different things I admit I said there for type after type wondering why in the world is this man talking about because everybody just Rejoice you know and he was constantly not torn off on it I started my business I'm just getting a point across right and I you know what he constantly said you can be seated and why should one man there must be a lot of people coming in you know we'll come find out everybody jump up when he broke those points you know and I didn't know that and I had to I went back and I asked him I said watch this a holding system I said I happen to know that he's got to be making some form of a coated uh kovich you know how do you uh c-o-d-e code you know coded yeah not a code coded you know but it was some kind of a thing that he was saying something that everybody there understood but those outside of there didn't understand all right we'll come to find out what it was but see brother dick you remember when you're first in yeah in other words when you first heard my Doctrine he said but now you remember when you got really into the doctrine with me and you become married for my daughter was he then you become a family with us oh okay now I don't know what the man's talking about you know yeah but my point is just to say in that in case somebody hears those points you know because I did listen and I listened and I don't I do not listen now folks I'm honest my wife will tell you or anybody's everywhere I've told you over and over again you could you come tell me brother so I throw it off the message brother the other day gave me something to tell me to to look at you know and I've got one thing underlined to go back to him to show him that maybe I don't know what this man's talking about right here but other than that I read it with the best understanding I could read it not to try to find something I want to know what the man's talking about right because he may be talking about more truth than you think right you know all right and I killed the benefit of the doubt but like I said now they started out with the doctrinal issue of the virtues being the Thunders all right now we don't believe that the Thunder sounded Until the End Time correct amen we'll get to it in a minute about the seals all right now brother Brown said let the disciples the apostles you know they had these virtues right well did they did they know what the Thunders were right did Peter and them know what the daughters were right amen no no because that was the end time see so it was something trying to make a made a pretty picture but when you analyze the picture the cow is up in the tree she may be eating green leaves but she ain't on the ground where she's supposed to be you know she's supposed to be in the right place all right now say that not making no lie to nobody but just say that to to get me and you click a little bit okay you'll remember that quicker than you will anything else I see it then I found that out a long time ago I'd listened to a man he said you know you click something on people and he said they'll remember it so I'll tell a little dirty I mean not dirty but a little comic or something to go with what I'm saying in a thought and you'll remember it a whole lot if I said something dirty so I found out a long time about speaking you notice that you always remember right the comical part yeah she is you do that in school and that's where if you listen in school I always make my grades in school by listening because if you listen you can make it do click back to you it might take a while all right but now let's get into the point see I do not believe that the Seven Virtues would be the seven Thunders because you would be putting it in the wrong category the Thunder it will prove in a minute is the voice of God when the seal breaks now I will give you the end of the message to where you can now I believe that and can proved by The Prophet's message that it's these these Thunders as they sounded to bring us the voice of God to understand the seals is actually what will bring the virtues into being I do believe that I'll put that right up front so if anybody's listening I believe that you said well that was what he's talking about well that's all right but I didn't get that and I don't think anybody else got that the guy that the virtues with the Thunders and when the brother would tell you you got brother colleague now you have Mercer number three well then you Gloria Hallelujah number three why I called you said I was um well um brother Colleen brother Doherty can remember that there was five of us prayed for in a meeting to receive the baptism in the Holy Ghost years ago all right and the pastor I mean the preacher that prayed for us said I believe every one of you got it well you know just because he said that I didn't believe I had it right I'm honest God I know I didn't have it right wait with a couple of Brothers said they told me now that they believed that they got it because that brother said to God well it was five of us there's three of us here and brother calling brother already didn't say that and I didn't either the two brothers that are gone said that yeah you know they left went back into the world all right you can't base your salvation upon what somebody said you got to make sure salvation and experience of God in your heart all right amen until then for somebody to just tell me say Glory Hallelujah we got the virtues called we know what the Thunders are that doesn't mean that that's right right amen it's when God gives them to you amen and I prove to you for many many years that the only way the virtuers can come into the body of Christ is for the word to be preached Amen to the body of Christ and it be revealed that's right that can bring to virtues right it's because you say you're in the message it doesn't make you virtue number one you know a lot of people believe that that we're born right here because or at least into here because this is the age where we're born to him Lord hallelujah it's an age but that doesn't mean I've got everybody I'm sealed in and ready to go because I'm born in this age so is everybody else born in this area are they ready to go no but let's get to it amen so let's establish I tell you I'm establishing the point of what I don't believe I don't believe the the Thunders are the virtues right I believe you can actually have the virtues and not know a lot about what the Thunders are amen yes sir because the disciples had the virtues you know technically they were not disciples they were apostles but that's Disciples of follower Apostles one who has the New Birth all right now but let's get down to think on something so bring up number one brother on the thing let's go into the first seal and what I want to do is establish one thing what is the what is your thunder no what is a thunder it's Thunders are mentioned in the bible other than in Revelation that's right it's mentioned over in the Psalms yeah you know the the Lord thundered he turned it from Mount Sinai amen amen right because we're going to get to that in a minute you know to show you that right around says the Thunder is the voice of God Amen that's right so that's what happened at Mount Sinai was the voice of God thundered but the people didn't have enough of God in them to know what was said Moses knew what was said right but they didn't understand it because they just heard it thunder all right all right we'll get to Matthew I mean to John in a moment where that that Jesus was standing there and he said glorify me with the glory I had with thee before the world he said and it thundered right that's what everybody thought well that wasn't it that was the voice of God telling him what he was right amen so what do you know all about the technical point of the Thunders and not even have anything related to it amen all right so let's get down what the prophet is really saying now all right when that lamb broke that first seal a thunder brought out that's Revelation 6 1. all right when the lamb broke that first seal of Thunder roared out that's Revelation 6 1. all right now there's not another Thunder listed any further amen right there's one thunder right the Seal's broke right all right I wrote around and said now what about when they break in reality that's right a clap of Thunder yep so there was a thunder in the Bible when the seal broke there was Thunder when God revealed it to the problem all right now so what now that's got a significance it's not a meaning it's a meaning nothing happens without a meaning or out of Thunder a thunder roared wonder what that Thunder was all right now to save time to you to read in between there they can keep rolling that up and let you look at it but he's covering what I said in John 12. and he comes down to the point of John 12 29 when it says you know glorify me with the glory I had with thee before the foundation where they said and the people that stood by heard it thunder see they thought it thundered so that's all they heard right yep like I said the people all they heard at Mount Sinai was a rolling thunder right right I think it says something in the song that the Lord goes up or something with thunder and there's a seven Thunders it's mentioned in song I didn't I'm not arguing the point I'm just trying to show you the thought all right now look what he gets on over to paragraph 146 and says when to thunder remember a loud clapping noise of Thunder is the voice of God and that's what happened to sunny out right that's what happened with Jesus a loud clapping Thunder that they thought it thundered but Jesus knew what it said right he went brother Brandon was on the Ohio River and it come down see everybody didn't hear that voice roaring out you know it wasn't everybody standing on side of the river heard the voice of heard thunder if you're not interested the place is supposed to be then you're just here in a rumble right you're not hearing the voice of God Amen all right remember a loud clapping noise of a thunder is the voice of God that's what the Bible said see clap of thunder and they thought it was a thunder but it was God he understood if or it was revealed to him it was a thunder and notice the first seal opened the first seal opened when it was open and assembled form it thundered symbol form was back there with John on patlas all right now what about when it's open in its reality form what did it do what did it reveal not all of it said first it was God next it's an assembled then it's revealed three things see it's it's coming forth from the throne first it can't be seen heard or nothing it's sealed up the Lamb's blood paid the price it thundered when he spoke it out and when he did a lot more writer started out and it still was a symbol she saw the Thunder when it sounded the white horse rider wrote out and it was a symbol so nobody didn't know what that was right it's a symbol right but see it thundered when that happened all right now let's go on over here let's pick it on that we'll just go on now did it always to be revealed at the last days when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to Christ but to the church notice that oh my that just makes me tremble I I hope that the church truly understands it see what I mean you people I'm going to call you bride see that you'll understand now that's the first time he technically ever said when he started off calling his bride because he would just link us in with the church but when you come up there in the fields he's gonna call you bride now not that he didn't speak of a bride before then but he he hung up and he related to us as well all right now watch what he said paragraph 152 first few the voice of the Thunder The Voice came from work from the throne where the lamb had just left his intercessor now he's standing here to take his position in his Planes but the thunder came from the inside of the throne to under it out and the lamb was standing out here the Thunder where the lamb had left left the Father Strong to go take his own Throne Glory now now don't miss it French all right I go off to it paragraph 262. let's read that one now let's find the symbols you read all in between there and get all the way he's talking about we found out what the thunder means now he's covered that it was a voice to Jesus it was the voice there it's under the tiny eye he covered all of those things now he says what that's perfectly we know that the Thunder was the voice of God when the seal opened all right now there was a thunder when the seals broke in the scriptures to John there was a thunder when they broke to the prophet but then he did not know what those seals were when he was in Tucson Arizona you need those quotes when he came back on the first seal he said I don't know what it is when he's preaching on the the uh God is Simplicity and then the bridge he said I don't know what the first deal is right right first heal he said I don't know what the second one is now if you want to make him alive go and do what you want to do with it but he said he didn't know why because he hadn't heard divorce of God he was only told if you run a thorough search he was told out in Tucson by the the cloud and the things and the angels he was actually told go back to Jeffersonville you need those I'll find them for you it'll be told to you what will happen he comes back to Jeffersonville he does not know what those seals were he had his own idea he was studying the message now if you don't believe me read the first seal he was studying the message from his old notes that he had preached that the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost that's right yep under his old notes he had preached that the demon the Lord broke the seal to him and he saw the white horse rider was the Antichrist he then he he brought it out go read that he said I'd have made a horrible mistake if the Holy Spirit hadn't come and straightened me out well he was going to preach you from his old notes you read the book get to see a book we've glad to run all these quotes through we've been there just 40 years we already know a little bit but all right but see then what he turned out to telling us that the Thunder is the voice of God when the seal opened well they were selling seals see the voice of God had told him what the first seal was didn't tell him what the second seal was that's right until the second day of it right and then the one on the second didn't tell him he's already got two Thunders but he doesn't know what the third one is you're coming down with me you follow me right right so something happened to the prophet what the seven Thunders broke right man he gets over to the seventh seal he said that's what it's been this week it's been the voice of God the seven thunders in Revelations 10 are the is the voice of God speaking to the prophet to tell him what those seals are what else they're going to make it all right amen that's what people has asked me questions about it you know well I just tell you what the prophet said oh but you don't understand brother so and so says is this and I just feel it's that it just gets me good yeah a good piece of ice running down your back will give you chills I'm not sarcastic I'm truthful all right man we've done been through the evidence of the baptism when the Holy Ghost is not shouting speaking in tongues Etc the evidence is whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word you can do every bit of that until be lost and die and go to hell that's right all right amen see Ephesians prophecies and everything else amen that's right that's what Paul said do I have tone to this and that and the other and have not charity right all right and it's time to settle down then to you that are listening and hadn't heard these things before Where Have You Been first off but second off you have an opportunity to hear amen that's right what is the thunder the voice of God what is the seven Thunders the divorce of God through each seal right amen there were seven seals and the voice of God sent it to the prophet the voice in the Bible was one Thunder the one in Arizona was one Thunder but he'd come back to Jeffersonville not knowing what those seals were nice people that believe he know it all along what everything was well now you making him a liar so go ahead I'm sorry all right all right amen he said he didn't right I see you make him a liar I mean I'm sorry I heard people's feelings being that hateful and speaking but what else can I say how do we grow up and be you know men and women of the Gospel you see what the end time has got that's why we've been here all of these years right it's because the people have been scared of the message oh don't get enough for the prophet's broken why can't we stream that's right right Hallelujah she did not come along and I say well do you understand Daniel 70 weeks and they say no I said well I'm sorry you don't understand what you see your car that's right well who are you tell me let me quote run around he said if you don't understand Daniel 's 70 weeks it's in the Daniel 70 week series third 62. if you don't understand Daniel 70 weeks you cannot understand the seals that's what he said amen let's tell me all about it I see people with bypassed right because they don't want that Thunder being the voice of God they want it to be what the brothers has tried to make it unless you don't get down to it a minute you know what's going through number three brother just keep laying it down then we'll get back to where we'll read that where the Prophet looks where the people say and his thousands of Little Voices yeah they want something like that well I do too look what your Prophet had to say this is all for questions and answers out of the seven Thunders 1964 8 30 8 30 the evening service how the seven Thunders which equals seven Mysteries already been revealed where they revealed in the Seven Seals but are yet but are yet not known to us as the seven as the Thunders yet and watch it no they were revealed in the seventh seal that's what the Thunders was about amen the Seven Seals is what the Thunders was about to read it they wish to reveal the seventh Thunders that had other divorces and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh Church age see do we have to have depend upon what the prophet had to say because that's where we hear the voice of God Amen Pride the prophet of God was the voice of God to this age right amen and we don't hear that voice that's right amen me not all of what US preachers saying he is but what God says it is you see what you don't ever understand brother the Thunders what's the new name you know what the Thunders are you know what the new name is I know the name Jesus and I'm gonna hang on to that for something that's happened because I can show you where brother Brown said it'll be made known when we get there when you go ahead and do what you want to but you see that's where people don't study the message they want some sugar tits yeah something to make them feel good now watch what I said I said I'd show this so look at the next one Statue of perfect man 1962 10-14 just one little nod from God that done it just assume why how could they know it was a nod from God they had all these virtues in here all these qualifications another disciples had the virtues but they didn't know what the Thunders were the prophet had the virtues yep come on you're going to argue he didn't have the virtues up in 62. I can quote pretty good you know sure you said when he went beyond the curtain of time he said I preached exactly what Paul preached he said ain't got the same results dude that's where people will say well now up until 62 you can't trust what he's saying why not that's right you show me how you understand after 63 when we're not taking what's before 63 and I mean you're you're all messed up you mean the angel of the Lord would have come to him that's what people just preach there's doctrines that that the son of man come to straighten brother Brown and Mike of course you know what they're saying right right I'm the guy that straightened him out he never didn't even believe it you gotta come to me I'm the one to straighten him out okay was up to Jeffersonville in 1968 I guess it was somewhere right along in there and the doctrine back then was who was to take over in lead us who was to lead us now that brought around was off the scene who was the Elijah of this day brother brother Billy Paul got up and read a quote from wrote around that I really thoroughly enjoyed brother Reynolds said the Elijah this day is the holy spirit that's right amen come on brother everybody look into who we follow yeah what's the matter we got the Holy Spirit here come on all right man I thought we're supposed to follow him come on that's why the Bible says you have no man needing that no man teach you that doesn't do away with teachers in a powerful ministry right that places it right amen you have the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit can tell you whether or not I'm telling you the truth right right yeah it's the only one that can tell you whether or not I'm going to save you right sure all right but I can't receive the Holy Spirit amen it will correct us all right but look what he's saying now those disciples had the virtues but did they have the Thunders I didn't even know anything about the time you're never even been brought out yeah because it would be in the seals it would be brought out to the prophet right you see where you're going wrong by saying that the seven Thunders through the Seven Virtues now here's the the quote that they go by 19 I said 61 it was 1961. uh Revelation chapter four which is uh paragraph 120 1960 108. all right here was moishes oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of live voices the Thunder of God thundering out into sweetness and Holiness Purity undefined lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christian that's that's Thunder against the enemy yeah the Thunder is what shakes the devil but the last one but when you know what that Thunder is Satan can't do anything with you the Thunder's the voice of God when he speaks to you the revelation of the seals amen all right for you to speak to the prophet and tell him what it is all right but if he don't speak to you and I tell us what those seals are then we've missed the whole voice of God if the prophet's message was to begin in 63 that's what he said then those Thunders would be connected in his message right to be able to be brought to us to bring us to Rapture and Faith right not so man to be followed that's right what do you think about brother so and so fine Brother a lot of good people in this message it's got all kind of doctrines amen and I will as I said I won't call names now I will say it this way when we're in Bible study sometime on Saturday if you will someone ask me who are those that follow these certain doctrines one two three four five six seven I will name them dark that's the best of my understanding I still have anything against them right now how's our brother and the old saying about the old ending you know brother Prairie green used to talk about something brother randomly quoted you know don't say nothing about him Anthony walk in his shoes you don't know where a man's come from oh it one day was an enemy to the church that's right having them killed causing them to blaspheme and the next day he was the leader of the church right right higher than even the apostles were so Peter said he says thank hard to be understood so just don't throw off on nobody remember where we came from man there was a day when some of you believe some of these doctrines stick move cover but where did we come from see we came from that so who can throw off on anybody my life first time we went to Jeffersonville I went around and come back and brother molt was over there and was up in the old Armory building brother mode I was just dying to laugh and he said what is wrong with you I said well brother I said well over here this one group and they said we're all old brothers in the message and this happened now unless they were all saying if you didn't see brother Branham you wouldn't urge a witness to him then you can't make it you know you got to be able to see him and know how he spoke and the way he done things to be able to understand him well I walked over to another group and all these was kind of my age you know younger then of course it's been a while ago you know and a lot of the young ministers that are today old ministers they uh they were talking and they said well you know it was all of the 20 years and older died off all them it's seen you know wrote around them in other words Moses you know said they all died young so it's left us under 20 we didn't get to see the prophet we take over and go on I was just dying the laughing I said where do we fit you know what do we do yeah yeah but we've been going on that's right but now listen to what you're getting to see thousands of Little voices I agree with that that's right because Paul thundered his message to the first church age yes he did Peter thundered on the day of pentecost's message to the church amen well brother Randleman 47 thundered for it the voice and that voice kept increasing by the knowledge of understanding that God opened to him and he stood there in 62 and he said I preached exactly what Paul preached he said now where they believed in one God I believed in it and God remember could lead a prophet because down Through the Ages I admit that down Through the Ages let's see brother Brown covers and I'll give you these if you like it let the pure unadulterated word went into the ground at the fourth Church age I can give you that quote if you like it because it started and kept on going up until Colombia and and uh you know when you're coming down up and you got up here to Columbus every how you pronounced his word uh up to that age they had to Pure unadulterated word but then the Catholic Church hid the word from the people and Martin Luther could only come out with a just you'll live by faith but you know what that was that was the new bird of that age you know what that was that was God thundering through Martin Luther the to just shall live by faith thousands of Little Voices went forth in his age to conquer the Catholic church and their ideas and doings Right Wesley come along stepping up a little higher got thundering through that right but now where they were in the Statue of perfect man is hard to understand because I believe they got there at Faith by the new birth but did they get these virtues how many I don't know maybe some had different things just cause you got knowledge of the message don't give you Holy Ghost knowledge that's right it's because you've got a Temperance because you can control your temper don't mean the Holy Ghost Temperance right right all right you understand what I'm saying see then the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the juicer Street coming back but still see there was no one there to teach the people because that was what Peter was doing Peter was in second Peter he was teaching others because remember how I preached to you the 120 in the upper room God never used novices to write the Bible to use those that were anchored into work right man all right and those that got anchored into work could be used to bring forth the message right all right and the people of that day when they were born again remember we've we've divided it to where we'd understand and deceived and that would be very valuable that everybody that's born again is born again at Faith I believe amen but that don't put us all the way up in the pyramid we've got to grow in that all right just cause your age you're born then doesn't put you brotherly kindness that's right that's Philadelphia that's the that's the city upcoming Philadelphia that's brotherly kindness you because that's what it means and you go up there and you run over by car you say that's my brother it'd be hard to believe all right yeah but yeah gee I don't believe that I'm just telling your personal opinion now I don't believe that through Luther's age what's his age and Azusa Street Pentecost that they could have crime very high in the pyramid right sure if you can show me something right around says and I will be glad to accept you but I just don't believe personally they could climb very high because it's according to the amount of words you receive all right now but here comes a prophet yep he said it took it 30 something years go to stature perfect man to see what I'm saying it took him 30 something years before he could preach him go back in 1955 or 56 on a message the Old Timer used to be Intervale and look at what he's saying about how that God wants to use your voice to speak to people God wants to speak through you go through all of your adoption series the adoption series was basically up and just maybe one or two message on adoption that's really titled adoption with only they were all in between the 40s and the the 62. go check it see because that's what he was doing he was teaching her doctor 30 something years to teach that amen you know why that I believe him because he was gaining ground of his own self see he was a prophet you and I can't come up that stature perfect man you see somebody now I'm not throwing off on him just telling you like I'm leaving okay you say well this man over here because now he's hurt around I don't know how much he's read but that's all right we'll see somebody down the road down there ain't never heard of run around you tell me he's got stature perfect man I'm gonna tell you I don't agree with you well that man's got virtue that man's got patience and all right all right we ain't got holy Holy Ghost that's right he ain't got Holy Ghost knowledge question him a little bit on the word you'll find out that's right because he's got the virtues and things the apostles had he'll agree with what the apostles said that's right sure there's wonderful people out there I've always said that to you there's wonderful people in those churches they're preachers out there in a more the more um qualified to preach than I am I'm talking about live wiser of being so sweet and humble and nice and and great potential don't mean it so we're in the day that the word's got to be right amen that's right around was a prophet amen so God could carry him up the pyramid you get it nice he could bring him through from Faith to Virtue and knowledge to temper to patient to Godliness to brotherly kindness all right and you notice I stopped I didn't bring our love all right right because I believe this message was The Headstone amen whether you believe it or not I believe this message wrote around abroad was The Headstone manager all right and see that hasn't come yet right then we'll give you a couple of quotes it's your order not over just pull up number six look what he said on adoption 1965-22 in the evening we'll just get a little point then I gotta hurry the pyramid never was capped was it the pyramid there's no cap on it all right that's the one he's always referring to I guess that's the way you pronounce it something close to it never did have a couch don't put on they never couldn't even find it they don't know what ever happened to it why if I wasn't the cats don't put on bad stuff the top of it because he was rejected when he come he was rejected Stone that's right but it will be capped that's right and then those stones that fit around that headstone will have to be stoned like that'll be so completely like that stone till it's been ever join and everywhere amen did The Headstone did not come all right all right let me just quote these and then if you want them you can have a future home 1964-802 that's the reason the Capstone wasn't put on by Ena see that's the reason the Capstone has to come now the mountain will be pushed up and it'll be the Mount of the Lord dedication 62 11-11 in the morning service now we already have the stones the stones God for ordained see and we've got them all the way from Ephesus to ladyocila we're we're only waiting for that headstone that the builders rejected waiting for his coming the captain Stone hmm is this the sign of the end sir 1962 12 30. this that is this the mystery of the Thunders that will bring back that headstone for flatten up Brothers number nine and let them read it but pyramid never was kept I guess you're ahead of me putting them up in them you know the headstone is yet to come it's been rejected see The Headstone had to become the Cornerstone that's right of the church right cause The Headstone was crashed right and he's a Cornerstone well you couldn't manifest yourself as a headstone It could only manifest itself at the Cornerstone he couldn't manifest himself up here as as the point of love yet love was there but he manifested himself as Christ right waiting till the end time number 10 go ahead put them up make them real just like the pyramid that's in the middle that's 1964 8 23 in the evening this is after the shield bro and we find in that pyramid they never did get the headstone on it why The Headstone Is Yet To Come the seven steps in the pyramid will go through that someday it's just like to show you how it really is perfectly with the scripture the man here that can turn on the lights or turn on the lights reach 1964-125 they don't know where it's at now when that headstone returns it'll be just like the rest of it it will blend in with it with the stone that's left open if you should put the headstone on it it'll have to be that way and when Jesus returns he'll find a church that's washed without Sparta wrinkle and it'll be the same Ministry hey he had it'll bring back The Headstone man all right see the pyramid never was count the natural pyramid because what type of Christ in the church The Headstone did not come I believe the headstone to this church is the seals that broke to the prophet his message not just say single get his message his message begun in the seals now I prove that to you he said not in the years of preparation et cetera et cetera future humble but when he began to sound his message run around had to come and do a work of restoration go back and pick up that and teach these virtues here to us teach these the message to bring us up through there in the virtues all right and I believe he stood there in 1963. with that church ready I mean that him ready not his church because it wasn't ready at that time the church wasn't he was ready and God took him to Arizona and kept him off right I believe that's his adoption you can believe what you want to you can say well it was in his early ministry that's fine I'm not going to argue with you about it I'm just going to ask you where's the quote I can show you where the Prophet said that when the Capstone comes what it would do all right and you can see that's what it done in 1963 when the prophet him though was done and even until now they've got the doctrines that the Lord came to the Earth in 63 and this that and the other all kind of things you know there's all kind of doctrines in this message about 63 and and all of those and 77s and and all of those I'm not concerned about that I'm concerned with one thing trying to get me and you to see Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ come and met the prophet there in 1963 and he brought him his message to deliver you go in the messages you just go and ask you to do this just get a book that's Timeless the tapes you know what I'm talking about the book that you index book and just read the titles and you'll see that 1963 brother rounds message went into eternity future home things that are to be Christ mystery God revealed he'd always preach one true and living God right money to death preached Christ the mystery God revealed over again he always preached who Melchizedek was but then he preach who is this male Chestnut brought it down to the people you see what I'm talking about this message is to bring you and I to that place amen right and I agree we'll give you the quote right you don't know Brothers the last one 327 Church age book I agree with this now this message your Malachi 4 and Luke in Revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children back children to the father phase number one the reason is Phase number one is because that's got to happen before we really know where we're at that's right you and I are going to have to be turned back to the faith of the fathers before we know where we're at and were you hearing the message now anybody preaching Faith to the father come on I'm open on that show me they don't talk about faith of the fathers in the morning it's these great Revelations and it goes off the message right look what he goes on the site now two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the Revelation contained in the Seven Seals now watch I love this it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so run around come and brought the message to you and I God took him off to say because his message was to live it's not giving you the other day where the Prophet said this bride is to vindicate Malachi 4. Luke 17 30. vindicate amen I believe that I believe that the Thunders right the voice of God when the seal broke and when those seals break to you and I it can build a statue of a perfect man into you and I all right man and without those things we don't have it all right I don't care how much you call virtue whatever you got or whatever you call knowledges and temperatures and things if it ain't Holy Ghost temperance amen you say oh now brother there we know the difference yeah you used to interpret the word Temperance as meaning not to drink alcohol right right come on I hope too with a profit he said that's not what it is not to drink alcohol he said it's that uncontrollable temper you got my brother and I got bored again I got you were going to call it faith I got born again I don't have no temper in me well why do you need Temperance for all right Miss God and I got the Holy Ghost I got all the patience in the world you trying to prove that to me or you yeah I had all the knowledge where'd you get it from church I can take all these doctrines if you want to spend time and show you that everyone come out of Genesis that's what your Prophet said that's right and all of these doctrines yep come from the churches they come from the Mormon Doctrine is that who sows two Lords come down from worth it the baddest had two seeds in the spirit Doctrine right River Jordan come from work he went gone to the River Jordan corinthius is that the way he pronounced his name in the time of John the do right away writer John in other words about 80 50. serenthius was teaching I gave it to you Wednesday night that Jesus was not the substance of God a good old-fashioned Baptist Doctrine God in three persons Blessed Trinity co-equal and co-eternal sure you see what I'm talking about these doctors are not you their Spirits they come down from those others who had the doctrine you want a good Baptist a good bad news spirit I just believe the prophet I believe everything the prophet never say yep well when it's word says for sake not to sin well now I don't believe that I believe everybody else well that ain't good bad news comes back and said to believe everything he said you get what I'm talking about that's right not trying to show smarter like no because I don't covered it we all come off of the tree you and I fell off of some tree somewhere right but what's the worst part of people don't want somebody to stay with the truth and can tell you and say well all right you showed me they don't want to hear that you showed me where I ever followed any of those doctrines and I studied them ever won and knew the three or four that I've covered I knew the people personally that started them the church I'm sorry I just stay on one thing let's stay with the prophet amen that's right you're just stubborn okay thank you just don't make me a meal make me a donkey but not a meal all right yeah all right but listen that's why I don't believe the virtue see it would have been impossible for the disciples that had the Thunders you said well John heard it that's right but it was taken totally away from him and sealed up to where he could never say nothing about it because you showed me he did Daniel heard the Thunders and that's your Prophet had to say but he said it was sealed up until the end time that's right that's why it's not the virtues but the Thunders as we read after life the Thunders of God thundering forth the Thunder of God thundering forth through the prophet of God to bring us to revelation of the seals and tell us what the Thunders were can now Thunder through our lives he can Thunder his voice through our lives out to the people yeah they can see Christ and just like I started off giving you mathematically people don't even keep things straight seven eyes if you look at that pyramid behind you and you count these eight things back there Faith virtue and Only temperation God doesn't really kindness and religions no there's not written in the Bible but there's an extra one in there even said the Holy Spirit the disciples had these virtues he said they had the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost now we're going to get to it this evening where people says we know how the Holy Ghost now like it did in the Bible of course you know what that is the man that believed in the Thunder said I'll tell you when you got the virtues the man that had the doctrine of no Holy Ghost Doctrine is what it's called he was the one going to tell you when you got it see there ain't no way I can tell you when you got anything right don't come to me and Ashley's brother Dave do you think I got it I said I don't know you must be questioning something because you're sure we're talking like you're negative you mean you don't know I love what brought around said come on brother I love what he said about it he said anything but one person going in Georgia all of you got to find you another state because I'm the one but he said if you don't believe that right whether Benny if you don't believe you're that one you better start searching for that one right right because you got to say you're the one amen right Sister Barbara you got to say you're the one don't say it with my pastor I know he's going to be there you don't know whether I'm gonna be there or not that's right and that don't prop me up for you to say that if I'm lost I'm lost you gotta have the thing you gotta have virtue you gotta have knowledge you gotta have temperatures you gotta have them yeah patience you got to have the baptism of the Holy Days amen that's right for your own heart and life amen you got to be in Christ now let's get down to one okay one thing but you can claim all them virtues and if you differ with the word then you know for sure you're not right that's right If you deny anything you show me any word that I've ever denied anything this Bible says and this Prophet had to say come and show me now I'm not a word or something I slipped a tongue you know don't do it that way that's silly that's not that's like this too wide two Blind Men or the one blind man that's I'm I don't don't be silly don't you know let's be honest and sincere because our lives were Extinction that's right Brother Richard when I he came here her son-in-law he said I didn't know that run around said these virtues are required it's not to be talked about it's a requirement to happen those that are going to take the change of the body are going to have these virtues now we may go by the grave and somebody have to pull us out yeah right but the ones who are direct the moment of the change will have these virtues sealed in and everything will be right the hip Stone will be there have a name you might have an eight dollars open right now you're having a heart at all as well over there
