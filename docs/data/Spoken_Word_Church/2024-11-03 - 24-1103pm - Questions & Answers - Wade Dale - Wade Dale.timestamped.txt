[9:58] to be in the house of the Lord good to
[9:59] have each and every one of you here good
[10:01] to
[10:02] uh good to be alive and well and serving
[10:05] the
[10:07] lord amen that was a good song We I
[10:10] appreciate that that was a real good
[10:12] song that's hard that song was hard when
[10:15] you're singing it going down the road
[10:17] you you can't keep up with him hard they
[10:18] it was pretty it was pretty tough but I
[10:20] sure enjoy that that was a beautiful
[10:21] song and uh when it's sung by the bride
[10:25] it makes a little it has a little
[10:27] different ring to it you know they sing
[10:30] it professionally with every note and I
[10:33] was listening to One going up to to Camp
[10:36] the other day and I mean it's you hear
[10:38] all that reverberation in the back and
[10:40] you hear that it sounds like they're in
[10:42] a Big Concert Hall that's all added
[10:46] that's all that's all fake stuff they
[10:48] add all that and U the squeaky voices
[10:51] they take them out so the only thing is
[10:54] real is the people of God the people of
[10:57] God's real when you sing you can sing
[10:58] out of you can sing squeaky whatever you
[11:01] want to sing but you do it to the glory
[11:03] of God and that's all that matters so if
[11:06] you got your Bibles let's turn to uh The
[11:08] Book of Luke the first question that we
[11:11] have today is what is the bosom of
[11:13] Abraham so we're going to discuss that
[11:15] just a little
[11:17] bit and uh it's a good
[11:19] question uh but remember also to the uh
[11:23] announcements remember the paper uh down
[11:27] on the uh it's on I meant to tell you
[11:30] today it's on the refrigerator
[11:32] downstairs and just get ready for this
[11:34] in two weeks brother Bob will be
[11:36] speaking this coming Sunday U I'll be
[11:38] gone I'll be in Kentucky hunting and uh
[11:41] then the 17th will be our Thanksgiving
[11:44] dinner um church will be providing the
[11:47] Mee and and you just provide the sides
[11:50] and then we sure do appreciate each and
[11:51] every one of you staying for communion
[11:53] in foot washing and uh it just seems
[11:57] that sometimes that uh uh um ordinances
[12:00] are not important to
[12:02] people uh and I'm sorry but they
[12:05] are God put them in there you tell me
[12:07] where he took them out so they're very
[12:10] important to do and and the Lord said do
[12:13] this till I come well he's yeah we know
[12:16] he come in 63 and I've had heard that
[12:18] argument before but
[12:21] um I believe what brother Brown said
[12:24] about the gifts I believe the ordinances
[12:27] too the ordinances were given to keep
[12:28] the church clean everything God give us
[12:31] was to keep the church clean there's
[12:32] nothing dirty about God it's us we're
[12:35] the dirty ones and we have to be kept
[12:36] clean we have to be Washed by the Water
[12:38] of the word all the time man to get the
[12:41] dirty smut of the world off and and uh
[12:45] we sure appreciate you being here so
[12:47] let's uh let's go to the Lord in prayer
[12:49] dear Lord thank you for this day you've
[12:51] give
[12:52] us thank you for the word that you've
[12:54] give us that you've that you've given us
[12:56] this full seven course meal Lord that
[12:59] when we open the pages of the
[13:01] book we can read it like no one else on
[13:04] the face of the Earth we can read it
[13:06] with inspiration and we can read it with
[13:09] faith that it was given to us by a
[13:12] prophet in the end time
[13:14] correctly we don't have to wonder
[13:16] whether this one's right or that one's
[13:18] right Lord we know that you sent us a
[13:20] prophet that gave us a correct
[13:22] interpretation of the word of God lord
[13:25] just as you wrote it we're seeing it
[13:27] father and I pray that you just be with
[13:28] each one give us all strength for this
[13:31] journey bless the ones that are sick the
[13:33] ones that couldn't be here Lord I pray
[13:35] that you'd bless them be with brother
[13:36] Bob and him they'll be on the way back
[13:37] pretty quick on the highways bless each
[13:40] one as we travel father around the
[13:41] country and different places lord it's
[13:43] just the devil wants to get rid of us
[13:45] and and um Lord I pray that you'll
[13:48] protect us and let that angel be sitting
[13:50] there with us Lord everywhere we go and
[13:52] everything we do but we'll Lord we'll be
[13:55] fearful to give you the praise and honor
[13:56] and glory for all things that we that we
[13:58] have
[13:59] and all things that we do and all the
[14:00] things that's coming up father I pray
[14:02] that you'd bless each one open the words
[14:04] to us father in Jesus name amen all
[14:07] right let's read the book of
[14:10] Luke can everybody see that
[14:19] okay don't ask me to do something
[14:22] again hang
[14:26] on how'd that that work okay okay all
[14:29] right Luke 16:22 now it came to pass
[14:32] that the beggar died and was carried by
[14:34] the Angels into the into Abraham's bosom
[14:38] the rich man also died and was buried
[14:42] and in hell he lifted up his eyes and
[14:44] being in torments and seeth Abraham a
[14:46] far off and Lazarus in his bosom and
[14:49] cried and said Father Abraham have mercy
[14:51] on me and send Lazarus that he may dip
[14:53] the tip of his finger in water and cool
[14:55] my tongue for I am tormented in this
[14:58] flame go ahead and be seeded and we'll
[15:00] continue reading this but the question
[15:02] was what is the bosom of Abraham or
[15:05] Abraham's bosom and it's also called
[15:08] Paradise all right it's also called
[15:11] Paradise Jesus told the U the thief he
[15:14] said today you'll be with me in Paradise
[15:17] all right now the bosom of Abraham as we
[15:20] continue reading this the bosom of
[15:23] Abraham is what the Old Testament Saints
[15:26] look toward they look toward Abraham
[15:28] Abraham was their father the father of
[15:31] Faith he was and I was thinking a few
[15:33] minutes
[15:34] ago you know man is a great mystery
[15:37] nobody you know until brother brandham
[15:39] came along no one said that Abraham and
[15:40] Sarah had their body
[15:42] changed nobody they just had a child in
[15:44] their old age that's what the Bible says
[15:47] but we realize and I think that I think
[15:49] the people that studied the word of God
[15:51] in that time realized also that there
[15:55] was something happened to Abraham and
[15:56] Sarah it was something abnormal they had
[15:59] a child and then grandma was so
[16:03] beautiful that a king wanted her you
[16:05] know so I think they read between the
[16:08] lines their s CU even uh you know we all
[16:11] know brother Dale always told us that
[16:13] the the Pharisees knew what happened in
[16:15] the garden see they they weren't full of
[16:17] all this other
[16:18] ideas back then even when Kus was here
[16:21] on Earth 2,000 years ago when Jesus came
[16:23] along they were blinded to who Jesus was
[16:26] but they weren't blinded to what
[16:27] happened in they read that old Old
[16:29] Testament way more than we read the New
[16:31] Testament they it was required that they
[16:34] know that thing I mean up down sideways
[16:36] whatever they said you know you could
[16:38] roll it up and stick a pen through it
[16:40] and it they tell you every scripture
[16:41] that it went through so they studied it
[16:43] they weren't just dilatory and said well
[16:46] we're looking for a messiah no they knew
[16:48] what how he would come and even Jesus
[16:51] said have I not come in the way you you
[16:53] that that the word said I was going to
[16:54] come where have I missed it at and I say
[16:58] that the same thing with brother Brandon
[16:59] where where did he where did they miss
[17:01] it at they missed it in him coming being
[17:04] the prophet in the end time and just
[17:06] called him a good guy he was a good
[17:08] preacher he had a good Healing Ministry
[17:10] but his when he started preaching you
[17:11] know he was off well
[17:14] that's we don't believe that we know
[17:16] that all right so what is the bosom of
[17:18] Abraham so everyone looked toward
[17:20] Abraham Abraham was the father of their
[17:22] faith Abraham was the father of their
[17:24] nation and that's kind of weird because
[17:26] Abraham was a gentile you you know but
[17:29] but they call Abraham you know the
[17:30] father he was a Hebrew Abraham the
[17:32] father of our faith well they look
[17:33] toward Abraham for everything definitely
[17:36] Lous he identified in hell he knew who
[17:40] Abraham was cuz he said Father
[17:42] Abraham right so the bosom of Abraham
[17:45] was a place the word bosom means right
[17:48] here in the center you you your sisters
[17:51] you you take your children and you put
[17:53] them in your bosom right you put them
[17:54] right here in your breast right here to
[17:56] hold on cuz that's where your heart is
[17:58] well that's when people they couldn't
[18:00] call it anything else there was really
[18:02] nothing in the Old Testament except that
[18:04] they would pass away and and that that
[18:07] some may be an angel and some may be
[18:08] this but they knew that that if you were
[18:11] faithful to Abraham and you're faithful
[18:13] to the doctrines of Abraham that you
[18:16] were going to go into a place all right
[18:18] they were going to place of holding or
[18:20] waiting because
[18:23] remember I I think maybe some of the
[18:25] question will get will develop here in
[18:27] just a few minutes
[18:29] because there's a difference in the
[18:30] bosom of Abraham there's a difference in
[18:32] that paradise and what we're looking at
[18:35] now right right there's a difference
[18:38] there we know there's one thing for sure
[18:41] God knew people would die so he set a
[18:45] place for everyone to go there's not a
[18:47] soul wandering somewhere out in another
[18:50] dimension that's just wandering around
[18:52] and then all of a sudden one day you're
[18:55] going to find out where you're at no
[18:57] everyone is going to a
[18:59] place all right when he die you got to
[19:02] go somewhere because remember you don't
[19:04] die you just move your Dwelling Place
[19:07] all right you move from there to here so
[19:09] you move your Dwelling Place one of them
[19:10] still on okay so the bosom of Abraham
[19:15] was a place that they had seen in the
[19:17] Old Testament that they were going to go
[19:20] to
[19:22] waiting for the Messiah to come cuz they
[19:25] believed in the
[19:26] resurrection I mean all this is not not
[19:29] that this wasn't foreign when Jesus
[19:31] started talking even they knew those
[19:33] things they just didn't think he was the
[19:36] one to bring it they didn't think he was
[19:38] the Messiah because number one I think
[19:42] their eyes were blinded we know that but
[19:44] they wanted him they wanted him to come
[19:46] the way they wanted him to come amen
[19:50] right is that the same way we're looking
[19:52] at do we want the word to come the way
[19:54] we want it to come or do we want it to
[19:56] come the way God wanted it to come all
[19:58] right we don't want it the way we we'd
[20:00] like to have well we'd like to have this
[20:02] and we'd like to be able to sit at home
[20:04] and press play we'd like to be able to
[20:06] put our jammies on and watch service and
[20:08] we had we're just lazy I'm sorry I do
[20:10] the same
[20:11] thing amen but this is De pressing this
[20:14] is a battle this is something you got to
[20:17] face every day something that's not
[20:19] normal tomorrow's going to be normal for
[20:22] us at work you're going to get up in the
[20:24] morning you're going to go to work
[20:25] that's your normal
[20:27] routine most people take Sundays off and
[20:30] in the world and they party they go to
[20:32] ball games they do picnics they go visit
[20:35] Grandma they go do all these different
[20:36] things on Sunday what do we do we come
[20:38] to church all right so we're kind of
[20:42] weird but we are fulfilling scripture so
[20:45] that's okay so let's read this one more
[20:47] time in the Book of Luke it came to pass
[20:49] that the beggar died now the beggar's
[20:52] name is Lazarus we're going to see this
[20:53] in just a few minutes the beggar's name
[20:55] is Lazarus now whether it's the Lazarus
[20:57] that that Jesus resurrected it doesn't
[20:59] say it's not real clear but we know the
[21:02] Rich Young Ruler is the one that died
[21:04] all right cuz brother R even brings it
[21:06] out and I didn't bring the quote so the
[21:09] rich man also died and was
[21:11] buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes
[21:14] now
[21:15] remember for the for the person that
[21:17] asked the question you look hell is at
[21:19] this moment is not
[21:22] burning as we know of burning
[21:26] fire all right it sh goana a place that
[21:30] you're going to go that you have no
[21:33] there's nothing there but but torment
[21:36] because as brother R said it has no
[21:40] foundation so you just continually
[21:42] falling how many's ever had a I had a
[21:43] dream one time that I was falling it was
[21:46] horrible woke up catching you know
[21:48] trying to catch yourself well you laying
[21:50] in a bed well what about if that was
[21:52] over and over every day if that feeling
[21:56] was every day and you knew then you were
[21:58] at a place that you were that God was
[22:01] not there someone said one time that's
[22:03] the worst hell you'll ever have is is to
[22:05] know that you're at a place that you
[22:06] can't get to
[22:07] God cuz right now you can get to God but
[22:11] you can't get to God then God is not
[22:13] even in that Dimension all right right
[22:16] so now look and in hell he lifted up his
[22:20] eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham
[22:23] a far off and Lazarus in his bosom so
[22:27] when we look at these dimensions there
[22:28] is
[22:29] somewhere that those overlap according
[22:33] to the Old
[22:34] Testament all right is everybody with me
[22:36] you don't have to agree with me just
[22:37] listen because there was a witch of
[22:39] indoor we're going to read it here in
[22:41] just a little bit there's a witch of
[22:42] indor brought up the soul of Samuel from
[22:46] a
[22:47] place and that which said I see Gods
[22:51] many people in this different dimension
[22:53] coming up and down and and all that you
[22:56] understand what I'm saying and then
[22:57] Samuel stands there talks to her and
[23:00] talks to
[23:02] Saul he says Saul tomorrow you're going
[23:04] to fall in battle and you'll be with me
[23:07] all right so now let's watch because
[23:09] that that's because that's the blood of
[23:11] bulls and
[23:13] goats all right there is sin still there
[23:16] now I can't explain that there's one
[23:17] thing I can't explain their soul was not
[23:20] born again so their soul was not God at
[23:23] that
[23:24] moment right there was a covering for
[23:26] sin made and we'll read it in book of
[23:28] Hebrews there was a covering for that
[23:30] there was not an eradication of that but
[23:33] see thank God he knew that and if they
[23:35] would do the ordinances of God and
[23:37] really in their heart feel that they've
[23:38] done that ordinance to take away their
[23:41] sin then God would cover it until he
[23:43] went to Calvary all right because the
[23:46] bosom of Abraham and Paradise is going
[23:48] to be done away with now let me caution
[23:50] you because if you look into the into
[23:52] the Bible is that heater on or the or
[23:56] the fan
[23:57] on we've had a little mix up because
[23:59] we've all the different times and and we
[24:01] usually don't have church on Sunday but
[24:03] if it's on about 70 it's okay I
[24:06] guess
[24:08] okay so we come to a place that we look
[24:12] and see that paradise brother R will
[24:15] tell us that we walk down through the
[24:17] paradises of God that's a different
[24:20] place there was a paradise made cuz
[24:23] Jesus said today you'll be with me in
[24:25] Paradise right but there is the paradise
[24:28] of God that we're going to go and the uh
[24:30] the Millennium won't
[24:32] be come on the Millennium is not the
[24:34] paradises of God there's still going to
[24:37] be people there there's going to be uh a
[24:40] man named devil there there's going to
[24:42] be different things that you're not
[24:43] going to have but that new city will
[24:45] be none of that there all right that's
[24:50] the paradises of God that the people are
[24:52] going to walk out and be able to uh U we
[24:55] can't fathom what it would be like right
[24:58] amen but it's there and it's inside of
[25:00] you crying out today if you're born
[25:02] again that's where your Paradise is
[25:05] that's where your new city is it's
[25:07] inside of you today right amen but that
[25:10] couldn't be inside of those Believers
[25:13] with just a covering of bull goat blood
[25:17] animal Turtles doves and all that stuff
[25:20] that couldn't take away
[25:22] sin but God so graciously put a place
[25:26] that he could keep them in cuz he knew
[25:29] we were going to die like I said before
[25:30] he knew we were going to die so as soon
[25:32] as Adam died there was a place for him
[25:33] to go as soon as different ones died
[25:36] Isaiah Jeremiah all the old soon as
[25:39] Moses died there was a place for them to
[25:40] go to right they weren't floating around
[25:43] so God had it all worked out but we know
[25:46] that we see that in the Old Testament
[25:49] speaking of the bosom of Abraham and
[25:51] then Jesus saying today you'll be with
[25:53] me in Paradise all right which was when
[25:56] they died he went to Paradise with Jesus
[25:59] but then they resurrected back up and
[26:01] Paradise was done away with we'll get to
[26:03] that in just a few minutes so in hell he
[26:06] lifted up his eyes being in torments and
[26:08] seeth Abraham a far off so there must be
[26:10] a way that you could see through those
[26:12] Dimensions because there was you know
[26:15] you didn't have a place that says all
[26:16] right this is where if you trusted in
[26:18] Jesus Christ this is where you
[26:20] go cuz remember you go back in the holy
[26:22] of holies that thing covers it stops
[26:24] there's nothing you can't look through
[26:26] it and look out back and look all these
[26:27] different place just right there right
[26:29] all right if y'all start falling asleep
[26:31] now I'm going to put some holy water on
[26:35] you he'll be real holy when I throw it
[26:38] at
[26:39] you holy cow and Lazarus was in his book
[26:44] so la look Lazarus was
[26:46] safe whoever that rich young ruler was
[26:49] and he was in torment he could look and
[26:51] see someone that was in
[26:53] safety Lazarus was probably sitting
[26:55] there beside of Abraham and they were
[26:58] talking walking and all of a sudden the
[26:59] dimensions opened up and here's Laz
[27:02] here's the Rich Young Ruler over in
[27:05] another place and he cried and said
[27:08] Father Abraham have mercy on me and send
[27:11] Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his
[27:13] finger in water and cool my tongue for I
[27:16] am tormented in this flame now remember
[27:19] that can't be a flame that consumes him
[27:22] right all right that can't be cuz he
[27:24] would he would just went
[27:26] away but it was a it was a fire that was
[27:29] burning that wasn't burning him up it
[27:32] was a
[27:34] torment but Abraham said Son now look
[27:37] this is Abraham talking to it Abraham
[27:40] said Son remember that thou in thy
[27:42] lifetime receivest thy good things and
[27:45] likewise Lazarus received evil things
[27:48] but now he is comforted and thou art
[27:52] tormented how about
[27:55] that that'll show you one thing for sure
[27:58] money don't mean your position in
[28:00] heaven money don't mean you gonna get in
[28:03] a cushy place or not get in a cushy
[28:05] place right CU if the beggar made it to
[28:08] heaven and the rich man didn't there's a
[28:10] there's a story there somewhere yeah all
[28:14] right but now he is comforted and thou
[28:17] art tormented now
[28:18] watch now Abraham knew enough to tell
[28:21] Lazarus or tell the Rich Young Ruler you
[28:24] can't switch back and forth
[28:29] praise the
[28:31] Lord it
[28:34] thundered and besides all this now
[28:37] besides everything I've already told you
[28:39] Rich Young Ruler between us and you
[28:42] there's a great Gulf fixed what is a
[28:45] gulf it's a body of water that separates
[28:47] two pieces of land and you can't get
[28:49] across if you I mean you just can't walk
[28:52] across and that's what he was telling he
[28:54] said look in other words you've made
[28:55] your choice and you are there the ri the
[28:59] uh beggar has made his choice and I've
[29:01] made mine and we are here but you can't
[29:03] come over here and we can't go over
[29:05] there all right can't switch back and
[29:07] forth right and besides this between us
[29:11] and you are a great Gul fixed so that
[29:14] they which would pass from hence to you
[29:17] hence where he was at to you cannot
[29:20] neither can they pass to us that would
[29:23] come from th then he said I pray thee
[29:26] therefore father that thou would
[29:28] send him to my father's house now here's
[29:31] the Rich Young Ruler saying okay if I
[29:33] can't get out of this send the message
[29:36] to my family my brothers my five
[29:39] brothers don't come
[29:42] here do whatever you got to do to not
[29:45] come here amen sounds like the Plan of
[29:48] Salvation to me if you'll get
[29:50] it for I have five Brethren that he may
[29:55] testify to now watch this is this is how
[29:58] how God works because that sounds good
[30:02] right I'm in a place of torment and I
[30:04] want you to send somebody to my family's
[30:07] house and tell them don't come to this
[30:10] place Abraham's fixing to tell him in so
[30:12] many words they ain't going to do them
[30:15] no
[30:16] good they got to decide not because
[30:19] you're burning up and you don't want
[30:21] them to burn up they got to make a
[30:23] decision for their own
[30:26] self for I have five brothers others
[30:28] that he may testify that he may testify
[30:30] unto them lest they also come into this
[30:32] place of Torment now this is going to
[30:34] kind of cover a little bit what I was
[30:35] saying this
[30:36] morning cuz I'm telling you without a
[30:39] believing set of eyes and a believing
[30:41] set of ears you'll fall for anything and
[30:44] you'll call good and bad and bad and
[30:47] good but good bad or bad good because
[30:49] watch what Abraham said now watch and
[30:51] Abraham saith unto him says unto who the
[30:56] Rich Young Ruler that wants that message
[30:58] to come out into Lula church today those
[31:02] of you that are with
[31:04] usen and Abraham said unto him they have
[31:08] Moses and the prophets let them hear
[31:12] them in other words you're sitting in
[31:14] this Dimension you're hearing the voice
[31:16] of of God not me the voice of God
[31:19] teaching you talking to
[31:21] you
[31:25] watch but he said nay
[31:29] Father
[31:30] Abraham but if one went unto them from
[31:33] the dead they'll
[31:39] repent and Abraham said unto
[31:41] him if they hear not Moses and the
[31:44] prophets neither will they be persuaded
[31:48] though one rose from the dead amen
[31:53] that's right what I was telling you this
[31:54] morning you could announce all over the
[31:56] country that brother Ram's come back
[31:58] from the dead and he's going to preach
[31:59] right here they won't be no more people
[32:01] they'll be as all the excuses that need
[32:02] to be and they'll not believe he's him
[32:06] just like they didn't believe Jesus was
[32:08] Jesus
[32:10] amen sorry about that that's what this
[32:12] whole thing is this whole allegory is
[32:13] telling us about though someone come
[32:16] from the dead and say I have come from
[32:19] listen if you bless you if you can't see
[32:21] Jesus Christ has come from the dead and
[32:24] he's in your heart I can't put him in
[32:26] there right amen your daddy can't put
[32:29] you put him in your mama can't put him
[32:30] in there you got to ask him to come in
[32:35] there but he said unto him if they hear
[32:37] not Moses and the
[32:39] prophets neither in other words what was
[32:42] that that was a message Moses and the
[32:43] prophets hey that's pretty good that
[32:46] wasn't just some Corner Street Preacher
[32:48] we're talking about Moses and the
[32:50] prophets neither will they persuade
[32:53] though one rose from the
[32:56] dead Luke 23 339 says one of the
[32:59] malactor which was hanging railed on him
[33:00] and said if thou be Christ save thyself
[33:04] and
[33:05] us but the other answered rebuking him
[33:07] saying dust not thou fear God seeing
[33:10] thou are in the same
[33:11] condemnation and we indeed justly for we
[33:15] receive the due reward of our Deeds but
[33:17] this man hath done nothing a Miss now
[33:19] how do you know
[33:20] that how do you know that cuz Jesus went
[33:24] to Pilot's Hall that morning they killed
[33:25] him that afternoon right here right that
[33:27] was a
[33:28] revelation that was him speaking with
[33:31] inspiration that he knew that this
[33:33] person whoever it was there was
[33:35] something way different about him even
[33:37] though they saw him hanging on the cross
[33:39] cuz the other two were probably cussing
[33:40] each other out and cussing this and
[33:42] cussing that and Jesus is just hanging
[33:45] there and he said father forgive them
[33:47] for they don't know what they do they
[33:49] knew he was different right and he said
[33:52] unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou
[33:54] comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said
[33:56] unto him verily I say un you today shalt
[33:59] thou be with me in paradise and it was
[34:03] about the sixth hour and there was
[34:04] Darkness over the Earth until the ninth
[34:05] hour and the sun was darkened the veil
[34:07] of the temple was rent in the midst now
[34:11] watch the veil of the temple was rent in
[34:15] one scripture says top to bottom all
[34:17] right so there's no way that thing's
[34:18] like 40 foot tall there's no way man
[34:20] could reach up there and do it and pull
[34:21] it down it had to be God ripping it from
[34:23] the top to the
[34:24] bottom because what did that do that
[34:27] told us us that the veil was now going
[34:29] to be rent from the Old Testament to the
[34:33] New Testament and then that would
[34:37] be
[34:39] unveiled and your sin would be not
[34:42] covered
[34:44] eradicated that's what it shows me
[34:46] that's what it tells me there's a new
[34:48] order but remember what they do they
[34:50] sewed the thing back up started
[34:52] sacrificing bulls and goats went right
[34:54] back to doing an offering until 870
[34:56] which was 40 years after Jesus died they
[34:58] just kept right on doing it until they
[35:00] destroyed the temple and Jesus cried
[35:03] with a that's what I'm telling you
[35:04] without a revelation we are not going to
[35:06] make it without God revealing
[35:09] supernaturally to you why you're here
[35:12] and why this message is the way it is
[35:14] and why it's being told or preached the
[35:16] way it is you're not going to understand
[35:18] it it's just going to be just like I'm
[35:21] sorry but it's like the old Charlie
[35:22] Brown thing with him and his teacher wow
[35:24] wow wow wow wow that's about all you're
[35:26] going to get amen cuz you don't see the
[35:28] fervor of people anymore you don't see
[35:30] the everything that we do needs to be
[35:33] hung on to the word of God Amen when
[35:37] Jesus had cried with a loud voice he
[35:39] said father into thy hands I commend my
[35:41] spirit and having said this he gave up
[35:44] the ghost so where'd he
[35:47] go where'd he
[35:50] go now brother R tells us he went to
[35:54] hell
[35:55] first then he went to par paradise and
[35:59] saw Abraham right thank God for a
[36:02] prophet so let's read
[36:04] that well let's read in
[36:06] numbers a man that is clean Shall Gather
[36:09] up the ashes of the hepher and lay them
[36:11] up without the camp in a clean place now
[36:13] this is this is the red heer that you
[36:17] have to kill the red heer you have to
[36:19] take his ashes and put it in water
[36:21] because it's a uh it's Waters of
[36:24] purification or separation that's why
[36:27] that Israel is now
[36:29] producing red heers I mean in reality
[36:33] amen and can only have like three hairs
[36:36] can be a different color only three how
[36:37] many hairs is on a bull or a heer I'm
[36:40] sorry a heer millions billions only
[36:43] three hairs could be different color
[36:45] well they say they got it now because of
[36:47] um this artificial in intelligence theyd
[36:50] be able to um do the DNA and they've got
[36:54] them they say they got several hundred
[36:55] of them but that's what they need
[36:57] because without that they know the
[36:58] Messiah can't come cuz they have to be
[37:00] purified for their
[37:02] sin messiah's not going to come to the
[37:04] temple without purification of sin
[37:06] listen messiah's not going to come to
[37:07] your temple without the purification of
[37:09] your sin but you hand them over to him
[37:11] and he takes care of them eradicates
[37:13] them gets rid of them and we ain't got
[37:14] to worry about them
[37:16] anymore but now we'll read here in a
[37:18] minute where Paul tells us that every
[37:20] year they made the same sacrifice over
[37:22] and over again oh right that's why God
[37:26] had to lay us apart heart over here for
[37:28] the Old Testament for for Samuel and for
[37:31] Saul and for all the ones you know
[37:34] sometimes we we put Saul in
[37:37] Hell Samuel he said you'll be with me
[37:40] tomorrow wherever Samuel was is where he
[37:42] was all right so we have to be careful
[37:45] we the old saying is is you know you get
[37:48] to heaven and you're going to wonder who
[37:50] why in the world this person made it and
[37:51] you're going to ask what are they saying
[37:53] they said well they're wondering how you
[37:54] made
[37:55] it so we'll be Sur R probably and the
[37:59] man that is clean Shall Gather up the
[38:01] ashes of the heer and lay them up
[38:03] without the camp in a clean place and it
[38:05] shall be kept for the congregation of
[38:06] the children of Israel for a water of
[38:08] Separation it is a purification for sin
[38:11] it's not an eradication of sin it's a
[38:13] covering of sin amen all right and God
[38:16] honored that because that's what he told
[38:17] him to do in the Old Testament but once
[38:20] the ultimate sacrifice came all that
[38:25] changed all right so let's go to Hebrews
[38:27] 9 and verse
[38:30] 8 the Holy Ghost is signifying now look
[38:34] there's no
[38:35] mention of the Holy Ghost in the Old
[38:41] Testament it's the spirit of God or the
[38:44] Lord um and all these different things
[38:47] but it never says holy spirit or Holy
[38:48] Ghost why that was in
[38:51] Jesus that was that that's why folks you
[38:55] have to be real careful nobody in the
[38:57] the Old Testament had the baptism of the
[38:59] Holy Ghost in their soul amen right they
[39:04] couldn't right whatever God I say
[39:08] whatever I know you know whatever God
[39:10] had he had the book of
[39:12] names all right he give it to Adam as I
[39:14] said this morning Adam took the book
[39:18] everybody with me all right then that
[39:21] was supposed to be that the Holy Ghost
[39:23] was going who overshot
[39:25] Mary okay thank you than you everybody
[39:28] with me
[39:29] now the Holy Ghost overshadowed Mary
[39:32] right there was a seed and a and a and a
[39:35] um egg both planted in Mary without sex
[39:39] there was no there was no emotion no
[39:41] desire right with
[39:43] me now remember he was the second Adam
[39:46] that's the way the first Adam was
[39:48] supposed to produce the second Adam
[39:50] produced it spiritually right right cuz
[39:53] when you got born again the seed of God
[39:56] was planted inside of you right they had
[39:59] over here before the
[40:01] fall everybody with
[40:03] me so the books here Adam has the title
[40:07] deed let's say to eternal life which is
[40:11] this the ability to say come forth every
[40:15] how you want to say tell it to to Eve or
[40:20] it would be no sex it would be just
[40:22] speaking spoken word is the Original
[40:24] Seed all right so that was the original
[40:26] way that was going to happen happened
[40:28] but once Adam and Eve polluted both mind
[40:30] and
[40:31] womb God shut the
[40:33] book the holy ghost overshadowed Mary so
[40:37] who's coming the book's coming it
[40:40] couldn't drop in Moses it dropped on
[40:44] Moses
[40:45] amen that's right it couldn't drop
[40:48] because I'll tell you something in just
[40:49] a minute it could drop on Isaiah but not
[40:52] go inside Isaiah it could drop on David
[40:55] and anoint David but it didn't make
[40:58] David's Soul
[41:00] Eternal right it would go upon this one
[41:04] because if you'll remember even John the
[41:06] Baptist now the Bible says he got the
[41:07] Holy Ghost in his mother's womb you can
[41:09] argue all you want to he did not have
[41:11] the new birth
[41:12] right he might have got the Holy Ghost
[41:14] but he didn't have the new birth right
[41:17] the woman at the well did not have the
[41:19] new birth right the new birth only came
[41:22] when Jesus had this inside of him and
[41:25] said the Holy Ghost is going to come
[41:27] back on you not on you but in you I'll
[41:30] be with you even in
[41:33] you in because
[41:36] remember John the Baptist was told there
[41:39] would be one
[41:40] come remember there'll be one come that
[41:44] when the Holy Ghost descends on that
[41:46] person it'll not just go on them it
[41:50] won't raise back up it'll go in them
[41:54] amen I believe the Bible says John look
[41:56] for the one that the Holy Ghost comes on
[41:58] and
[41:59] Remains the Holy Ghost never remained on
[42:02] anybody in the Old Testament except Adam
[42:05] but Adam was imparted eternal life he
[42:07] had to be cuz he was the first one he
[42:09] was the first one coming up excuse me he
[42:12] wasn't born a baby he wasn't born in
[42:15] sin but the sin came
[42:17] afterwards everybody with
[42:20] me it must be
[42:23] hot pinch
[42:25] yourself so so now the Holy Ghost didn't
[42:29] come until the day of
[42:32] Pentecost right to dwell in a group of
[42:35] people those pillows of fire sunk into
[42:39] those people they went in them and they
[42:43] became what should have been over here
[42:45] in this book the names in this
[42:50] book Peter James John all the other 11
[42:55] even Matias that received the Holy Ghost
[42:58] that's the way we should have come over
[42:59] here born by the Breath of God we've
[43:02] been te teaching that for a long time
[43:04] right so there was listen God is not the
[43:09] author of confusion and he won't dwell
[43:11] in an unclean
[43:13] vessel he won't dwell in an unclean
[43:19] place so the paradise had to be a place
[43:22] to where people
[43:24] went that didn't have the Holy Ghost but
[43:27] but they were that God knew by for
[43:30] knowledge who they were what they would
[43:34] be what their heart would be he knew
[43:37] David's
[43:38] heart David's going to be
[43:40] there the weaken tag murder we can tag
[43:43] adultery on him God
[43:49] can't it was eradicated to Calvary
[43:52] everybody with me now all right so what
[43:54] is the bosom of Abraham it's something
[43:56] God put in the Old Testament to put
[43:58] people in a place of
[44:00] holding all right now listen the ones
[44:03] that went on now that are in that sixth
[44:05] Dimension they're in a place of holding
[44:08] but they are locked in there they can't
[44:11] move to the fifth they sure don't want
[44:12] to and the fifth can't move into them
[44:15] but over here there was some way that
[44:16] there was a could be a communication
[44:18] because a witch brought up a
[44:22] prophet a witch brought up a prophet in
[44:24] the Old Testament Witch of indor
[44:28] brought up Samuel and they
[44:32] conversed and even he took and and into
[44:35] this Dimension we're in now he said Saul
[44:37] tomorrow you're going to fall in battle
[44:38] and you'll be with
[44:39] me but now remember over here that can't
[44:42] happen I'll read it to you brother R
[44:45] said there was there was something there
[44:46] was a question asked online or something
[44:49] and uh about where did you get that from
[44:53] that you know people can't communicate
[44:56] well brother r said
[44:58] it once you
[45:00] die he said if you can talk to a saint
[45:03] he said that's a he said that's not a
[45:05] Believer I'll read it to you hang on I
[45:07] got a quote for that so the Holy Ghost
[45:10] this signifying now this is Paul talking
[45:14] that the way into the holiest of all was
[45:16] not yet made manifest he's talking about
[45:19] the Old
[45:20] Testament while as the first Tabernacle
[45:23] was standing what the real Tabernacle in
[45:26] the wilderness and then Solomon's Temple
[45:29] and all that everybody with me the outer
[45:31] Court inner Court holy of holies all
[45:33] right which was a figure for the time
[45:37] then
[45:38] present right in which were offered both
[45:42] gifts and sacrifices that could not make
[45:45] him that did the service
[45:48] perfect right as pertaining to the
[45:52] conscious which stood only in meats and
[45:55] drinks and diverse Washings and
[45:57] ordinances imposed on them look until
[46:00] the time of
[46:03] reformation but Christ being come and
[46:05] high priest of good things to come by a
[46:07] greater and more perfect Tabernacle what
[46:10] than the one that's in the wilderness
[46:11] and the one that's over there uh the
[46:13] Solomon's Temple and all
[46:15] that not made with hands that is to say
[46:18] not of this building Paul's probably
[46:21] talking he says not of this building but
[46:22] he's talking about this building neither
[46:25] by the blood of goats and calves but by
[46:28] his own blood he entered in once into
[46:30] the holy Place having obtained Eternal
[46:33] Redemption for us am
[46:37] okay for if the blood of bulls and goats
[46:40] and of bulls and of goats and the ashes
[46:43] of an hepher sprinkling the unclean
[46:45] sanctifying to the purifying of the
[46:47] flesh how much
[46:50] more Paul's saying God allowed that in
[46:53] the Old
[46:55] Testament but how much more shall the
[46:57] blood of Christ who through the eternal
[47:00] spirit not a spirit of an
[47:02] animal the eternal spirit offered
[47:05] himself without spot to God Purge your
[47:07] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[47:09] Living God in other words this can't do
[47:11] it but this can all right this can still
[47:15] hold you accountable but if Christ
[47:17] Christ hadn't come they'd still be held
[47:19] accountable but Christ came and took
[47:21] them and
[47:22] us that's why his hands were out he
[47:25] stood Between Heaven and Earth he stood
[47:27] between Old Testament and New Testament
[47:29] brought them all together now see we're
[47:31] in the bosom of Christ but I say Christ
[47:33] is in your
[47:36] bosom and for this cause he is the
[47:39] mediator of the New Testament we'll read
[47:42] it this afternoon when we take communion
[47:44] he said this is my blood this is New
[47:45] Testament and my blood that by means of
[47:48] death for the Redemption of the
[47:49] transgressions that were under the first
[47:53] testament old testament all
[47:57] right they which are called might
[47:59] receive the promise of Eternal
[48:01] inheritance for where a testament is
[48:04] there must also of necessity be the
[48:06] death of the testator for a testament is
[48:10] a force after men are dead now remember
[48:13] the ashes and the heers and the the the
[48:16] the spirits of those animals never could
[48:18] come back on to somebody and make them
[48:20] clean right all right
[48:23] right mortal men couldn't die and come
[48:27] back and can't can't come back and make
[48:29] somebody clean he had to be God
[48:32] himself he was the soul of God so the
[48:35] soul of God can do whatever he wants to
[48:37] do but he came to save your
[48:40] soul for a testament is a force after
[48:43] men are dead so Jesus had to die for the
[48:46] New Testament to become forc what the
[48:48] book could start being named out the
[48:50] names could be coming out in the in the
[48:52] U on the day of Pentecost right
[48:55] otherwise it is a no strength at all
[48:58] while the testator liveth no one
[49:01] received the new birth while Jesus was
[49:03] alive right no one he was the New Birth
[49:08] he told Nicodemus you must be born again
[49:11] but that's telling Nicodemus that when
[49:12] I'm gone you need to get born
[49:16] again all
[49:19] right what y'all eat today y'all eat
[49:23] pasta don't eat carbs
[49:27] whereupon neither the first testament
[49:29] was dedicated without blood now remember
[49:31] the first testament it was dedicated it
[49:33] had
[49:34] blood right but it was the blood of an
[49:37] animal it wasn't strong enough to do
[49:40] away with sin so that you could put
[49:42] these people in one place an eternal
[49:46] Place sixth Dimension all those people
[49:48] are
[49:49] Eternal
[49:51] amen for when Moses had spoken every
[49:54] precept to all the people according to
[49:57] the law he took the blood of calves and
[49:59] of goats with water Scarlet wool his up
[50:02] and sprinkled both the book and all the
[50:06] people saying this is the blood of the
[50:08] testament which God hath enjoined unto
[50:11] you moreover he sprinkled with blood
[50:13] both the Tabernacle and the vessels of
[50:15] the ministry but he couldn't get that
[50:18] inside of
[50:19] somebody that couldn't go inside and
[50:21] change somebody cuz every every year
[50:24] they did the same thing over and over
[50:27] again right that's right and almost all
[50:30] things are by the law purged with
[50:33] blood and without the shedding of
[50:35] blood is no
[50:38] remission it was therefore necessary
[50:40] that the patterns of things in the
[50:42] heaven should be purified with these
[50:44] what
[50:46] animals but the Heavenly things
[50:49] themselves with better sacrifices than
[50:51] these Christ all right for Christ has
[50:54] not entered into the holy Place made
[50:56] with hands which are the figure of the
[50:57] truth but into heaven itself now to
[51:00] appear in the presence of God for us
[51:01] listen Abraham was not in heaven
[51:04] right Lazarus was not in
[51:07] heaven all
[51:10] right nor yet that he should offer
[51:13] himself often Christ don't have to offer
[51:15] himself every day for
[51:17] you Bible says one time for
[51:20] all cuz what' he do he didn't just
[51:22] barely sprinkle blood and just get rid
[51:24] of a few things he got rid of everything
[51:26] right that's what we got to believe
[51:27] folks we just don't believe that that
[51:29] blood's strong enough to take everything
[51:30] away from us that's what's going to
[51:32] change our body amen it's when we come
[51:34] to a place that we are We Are The
[51:36] Perfect sinless Bride of Jesus Christ
[51:38] and we know that by our heart not by our
[51:40] voice our
[51:42] quote for then must he often have
[51:45] suffered since the foundation of the
[51:48] world but now once in the end of the
[51:51] world hath he appeared to put away sin
[51:53] by the sacrifice of himself
[51:57] and as it is appointed unto man once to
[51:59] die but all after this the Judgment so
[52:02] Christ was once offered to Bear the sins
[52:04] of many and unto them that look for him
[52:07] shall he appear the second
[52:10] time that's us in the end time that look
[52:14] for him shall he appear the second time
[52:17] without sin unto
[52:21] salvation now the Book of Matthew tells
[52:24] us says Jesus when he cried with a loud
[52:27] voice he yielded up the ghost now
[52:29] remember he had when he right before he
[52:31] died he said today you'll be with me in
[52:33] Paradise told the told the uh thief on
[52:36] the cross you'll be with me in Paradise
[52:38] so somewhere between that time and this
[52:42] time Jesus went to hell come back up
[52:46] Paradise pick this guy up and we'll read
[52:48] it brother BR said Abraham and all the
[52:50] some of the Dead Saints rose up okay and
[52:54] behold the veil of the temple was ran in
[52:56] Twain from top to bottom and the Earth
[52:57] did quake and the Rocks rent and the
[52:59] graves were open now if you'll look at
[53:03] that the graves were not like
[53:07] this dirt doesn't hold a spirit right
[53:12] dirt can't hold cement can't hold a
[53:17] spirit nothing can hold a spirit except
[53:20] God
[53:22] himself so the graves were open there
[53:24] was an opportunity for their the Theon
[53:26] to come up out of that grave because
[53:28] that theophany wasn't in the
[53:31] grave it came and picked up what was in
[53:33] there and stood up on the Earth right
[53:37] and came out of the and the graves were
[53:39] open and many bodies now I don't
[53:41] understand who God picked it didn't say
[53:43] all it said many of the Saints which
[53:46] slept arose and came out of the graves
[53:48] after his resurrection and went into the
[53:50] holy city and appeared unto
[53:52] many right so now that was the emptying
[53:57] of paradise because remember the next
[53:59] person the first martyr to die was
[54:01] Steven now Steven didn't go into
[54:02] Paradise there was no Paradise for him
[54:04] to go into that's right that was after
[54:07] the New Birth the new birth then there
[54:09] was a place a sixth Dimension that The
[54:12] Souls of the ones that were born again
[54:15] went into and and couldn't travel and
[54:18] and definitely don't want to come back
[54:19] over here not
[54:21] yet all right everybody with
[54:24] me we know this now brother B we know
[54:28] this that in the Old Testament the blood
[54:30] of bulls and goats could not take away
[54:32] sin it only covered sin and the living
[54:36] look the living just waiting in in
[54:39] Paradise for the day that sin should be
[54:41] taken
[54:43] away but when Jesus came the Son of God
[54:46] the Messiah he took away sin he divorced
[54:49] it never covered it he took it away then
[54:52] now since then if this Earthly
[54:54] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[54:56] waiting in glory we go straight to the
[54:59] presence of the father there to be
[55:01] clothed in immortality all right 1953
[55:05] demonology now this Witch of indor she
[55:08] called up the spirit of Samuel and Saul
[55:11] talked with Samuel now
[55:13] watch now you might wonder how that
[55:15] could be done it cannot be done
[55:19] today no sir because the blood of bulls
[55:23] and goats was only a waiting for the
[55:26] time time of
[55:27] fulfillment when a man died in them days
[55:31] preachers back me up if you think it's
[55:32] right I probably they they probably
[55:34] didn't when a man died he died under the
[55:36] atonement of an animal and his soul went
[55:39] into
[55:41] paradise and there he stayed until to
[55:43] the day of redemption and his soul was
[55:46] in
[55:48] there everybody understand that what
[55:50] your soul is your soul is your theophany
[55:52] your soul is the spirit man that dwells
[55:54] inside of you and it's you right and and
[55:57] when the Bible says if this Earthly tab
[55:59] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[56:01] waiting there's not something hanging up
[56:03] in a closet like this waiting for your
[56:06] for your soul to to match that one there
[56:09] too many Souls running around you're one
[56:12] Soul when you die your theophany your
[56:14] soul goes to whatever place that it's
[56:16] that that you've told it to go right
[56:20] amen everybody with
[56:22] me so you know even brother Brandon will
[56:24] talk about the offing about this being
[56:26] over here 20 ft
[56:27] away your souls you're theophany there
[56:30] is nothing of you anywhere
[56:33] else and I thank God for
[56:38] that why it's very simple I know what I
[56:42] got to
[56:43] fix I got to fix
[56:46] me I got to fix me that over there is
[56:49] not perfect and I got to make myself
[56:51] perfect to match it no when you get born
[56:54] again that comes to you you that's that
[56:56] Genesis 126 man the part of God that he
[56:59] saw before the foundation of the world
[57:02] comes and resides in your
[57:04] soul and you and him are there together
[57:08] right not two Souls not not go hang it
[57:11] up somewhere and waiting on you to get
[57:14] there brother R said you building it
[57:16] right here
[57:19] right so now look now today he could not
[57:22] break into that realm and get a
[57:24] righteous man out of that
[57:27] realm he couldn't do it cuz righteous
[57:29] men are not in there where they used to
[57:32] be in
[57:34] Paradise no sir Paradise was done away
[57:37] with when the blood of Jesus took it
[57:40] away right everybody with me on that
[57:43] right 1953 demonology ensboro Kentucky
[57:47] the reason that the witch of Endor could
[57:48] call the spirit of Samuel because Samuel
[57:51] couldn't go into the presence of
[57:54] God the bosom of Abraham was not the
[57:56] presence of God right it was the faith
[57:59] of Abraham that you go to a place and
[58:02] believe believe that there's one coming
[58:05] that's going to take away your
[58:07] sins
[58:10] sorry when we go into another dimension
[58:12] either our soul is born again or not so
[58:15] there's not a there's not an in
[58:20] between but they went
[58:24] believing their prophets believing the
[58:28] Ten
[58:29] Commandments and believing the Messiah
[58:31] was
[58:32] coming now watch because Samuel couldn't
[58:35] go into the presence of God now Samuel
[58:37] was a
[58:39] prophet but he only had an anointing he
[58:41] didn't have the Holy Ghost in his
[58:43] soul and if I may say his soul was still
[58:47] black but it was a there was a time that
[58:50] God knew that Abraham would want that
[58:53] more well he already proved it on on the
[58:55] Earth amen he proved who he was on the
[58:58] earth now look he was in Paradise for
[59:01] the blood of bulls and goats would not
[59:02] take away sin but since Jesus died he
[59:05] divorced sin taken it away and the
[59:07] believer now goes into the presence of
[59:10] God now see that can be misconstrued we
[59:13] don't go right in listen Mama's not walk
[59:15] or my mama not still here but but dad's
[59:17] not walking around with Jesus
[59:20] today right but how many times have you
[59:23] heard that at a funeral are they either
[59:25] they're sit at the feet of Jesus or
[59:27] they're walking with Jesus on streets of
[59:28] gold that's not
[59:31] true it sounds
[59:33] good but that's not true that's coming
[59:36] but they are in a beautiful place don't
[59:38] worry about
[59:42] that and the believer now goes into the
[59:44] presence of God and he can't come
[59:48] back right now what he's talking about
[59:51] before that the Catholics were talking
[59:53] about interceding with Saints talking to
[59:56] him back and forth he said you can't do
[59:58] that now now and he can't come back
[1:00:00] Jesus said in Luke when he was talking
[1:00:02] about the rich man he can't return
[1:00:04] remember there's a great go fixed so if
[1:00:07] you're interceding with any any kind of
[1:00:09] a spirit of someone that's gone on
[1:00:11] outside of God Christ the only mediator
[1:00:13] between God and man then you are in
[1:00:16] spiritualism called
[1:00:18] religion now where is spiritualism at so
[1:00:21] be careful what you say about the spirit
[1:00:23] of God communing with Saints is
[1:00:26] spiritualism all
[1:00:28] right so be
[1:00:31] careful all right everybody with me the
[1:00:34] bosom of Abraham was a place until God
[1:00:37] could come and die on the cross there
[1:00:38] was a place that everybody went to
[1:00:42] paradise and then that it was a holding
[1:00:45] place right is everybody with Meen right
[1:00:49] because brother R tells us and I it was
[1:00:50] a long quote so I'm going to just
[1:00:52] paraphrase it Jesus died he went to Hell
[1:00:57] kicked Satan into the into the house
[1:00:59] took the keys of death and hell but said
[1:01:02] he came back up through Paradise knocked
[1:01:05] on the door and he said Abraham opened
[1:01:07] the door cuz it was the bosom of
[1:01:09] Abraham everybody believed that Abraham
[1:01:11] was the father of all
[1:01:12] this right and Abraham said oh that's
[1:01:15] the one we fed the calf
[1:01:17] to right each one saw him in their
[1:01:20] Revelation like Ezekiel Saw he oh that's
[1:01:22] the wheel in the middle of the wheel
[1:01:24] that's the one that did this that's the
[1:01:25] one that did that oh that's him right
[1:01:28] right Moses that's when that spoke to me
[1:01:30] in the burning bush and what did he do
[1:01:32] he took those Saints and he took them
[1:01:35] up remember the scripture lead Capt
[1:01:38] captivity captive give gift to men lift
[1:01:40] up you Everlasting Gates he he he had to
[1:01:43] do away with
[1:01:45] that because the next part that's coming
[1:01:48] is that we're going to get born again
[1:01:50] and then we're going to be putting in a
[1:01:52] different
[1:01:53] place we're not in Paradise anymore
[1:01:56] we're going to be put in a place where
[1:01:58] thank god brother random got to go to
[1:02:00] and explain to us why and where it
[1:02:04] at and that we're
[1:02:07] Eternal it's an eternal
[1:02:10] place the people are all
[1:02:13] Eternal it's not in the presence of God
[1:02:15] so much to say that God's there but had
[1:02:18] you ever felt the presence of God but
[1:02:20] you never saw a body you never saw Jesus
[1:02:23] floating around you understand what I
[1:02:24] mean you felt this presence they're in
[1:02:27] the presence of God all the time we're
[1:02:29] in a wave we get in the presence of God
[1:02:31] we get in the presence of the devil we
[1:02:33] get in the presence of this one presence
[1:02:34] of that one but over there they're
[1:02:36] continually in the presence of God so
[1:02:39] the bosom of Abraham is a place that
[1:02:41] people went before the New
[1:02:43] Birth that God could hold them there
[1:02:46] until he died he they were covered by
[1:02:49] the blood blood of bulls and goats till
[1:02:51] he died when he died that took that
[1:02:53] group of people with him and he went
[1:02:55] took them into a place and they're
[1:02:57] waiting somewhere right I'm not going to
[1:02:59] argue with whether they have bodies or
[1:03:01] not that's not part of my eternal
[1:03:03] destination okay right you can argue all
[1:03:06] you want to I don't I don't
[1:03:09] know right Bible said they resurrected
[1:03:12] so that's enough for me it's not going
[1:03:14] to it's not going to make my Revelation
[1:03:16] any better or
[1:03:18] worse
[1:03:19] right I mean it's it's it's in the Bible
[1:03:22] two to three different ways so you just
[1:03:23] leave it alone and go on I know one
[1:03:25] thing's for sure the Bride of Jesus
[1:03:27] Christ that have passed on are in the
[1:03:29] sixth Dimension their body still laying
[1:03:31] in the Tomb right amen that's all I'm
[1:03:33] worried about because the dead in Christ
[1:03:35] will rise first so whoever God brings up
[1:03:37] that's his business but we got to come
[1:03:40] to a place that they want to come here
[1:03:42] to get their
[1:03:43] bodies everybody with me all
[1:03:48] right now let's go to the short
[1:03:51] one since you said you're going to cover
[1:03:53] some of the Mysteries that brother Ram
[1:03:55] covered which we're going to give us an
[1:03:57] overview of the 70 weeks of Daniel
[1:04:00] please in 25 words or
[1:04:04] less why are we quiet
[1:04:07] for I know cuz most of you are asleep
[1:04:11] so Daniel 9 let's go to Daniel 9:23 and
[1:04:14] we're going to this is going to be
[1:04:15] you're going to be surprised brother
[1:04:16] Donnie this is a surprise it's going to
[1:04:18] not take very long because I want to
[1:04:21] explain something about Daniel 7 weeks
[1:04:22] real quick everybody look at me and quit
[1:04:24] looking over to wall look at me me can
[1:04:26] somebody not look at me I'm the one
[1:04:28] preaching to you the Wall's not if you
[1:04:30] don't like me you can go somewhere else
[1:04:32] put on some glasses that are like
[1:04:34] blinders you know and just listen to my
[1:04:35] voice cuz I believe I'm telling you the
[1:04:38] truth amen I believe I'm telling you the
[1:04:40] truth Daniel 70 weeks is to the
[1:04:44] Jews it is a Jewish
[1:04:48] restoration of as we say
[1:04:54] Christianity all right the Jews rejected
[1:04:58] Christ he didn't kill them and do away
[1:05:01] with them right he said I'll never
[1:05:04] forget
[1:05:06] Israel all right I'll never forget the
[1:05:08] Jews now they will not have the same
[1:05:11] position as they used to
[1:05:13] have he divorced them put them away he
[1:05:15] said but I can't forget them they'll be
[1:05:17] my
[1:05:18] servants right now they're
[1:05:21] lost right now they rejected their
[1:05:23] Messiah right right
[1:05:26] but God's going to come over here after
[1:05:27] the Gentile dispensation and he's going
[1:05:30] to give them the Holy Ghost and take
[1:05:32] them in a
[1:05:33] Rapture because they are to be the
[1:05:35] servant in the temple for me and you
[1:05:38] they lost their bridh good but they got
[1:05:41] their servant Hood right okay but right
[1:05:44] now they are I was you know kind of the
[1:05:48] Jewish thing going on
[1:05:50] now and U there was this one guy he was
[1:05:53] a some kind of a anti what do you call
[1:05:56] it anti
[1:05:58] anti-semitic you know they're always
[1:05:59] want to destroy the
[1:06:01] Jews why people want to destroy the Jews
[1:06:04] for because they killed Christ a lot of
[1:06:07] people their their
[1:06:10] anti-Semitism is y'all killed
[1:06:13] Christ well if they hadn't killed him
[1:06:16] folks you wouldn't be here
[1:06:18] today it was done for a
[1:06:22] purpose absolutely it was done for a
[1:06:26] purpose he blinded them he blinded them
[1:06:30] himself God blinded his own children so
[1:06:33] that me and you could be sitting here
[1:06:34] today
[1:06:35] amen all right so God's going to save a
[1:06:39] Jewish
[1:06:42] Remnant all right and he's going to and
[1:06:44] there is Jews have a time
[1:06:47] period all right there's a certain time
[1:06:51] this there's not 13 tribes of Israel now
[1:06:54] there's 12 there's not 146,000 there's
[1:06:58] 144,000 there's not 14 Witnesses there's
[1:07:01] two go God specific even in Daniel he
[1:07:05] says time times and dividing of times
[1:07:07] one two and a half so it'll be three and
[1:07:09] a half years everybody with me so God is
[1:07:12] specific with time when it comes to the
[1:07:15] Jews now to me and you as Gentiles time
[1:07:17] shall be no longer according to
[1:07:18] Revelations 10 remember the mighty Angel
[1:07:21] raised his hand he said time shall be no
[1:07:24] more and and remember everywhere we're
[1:07:28] we are depicted in the Bible the bride
[1:07:30] depicted in the Bible it's multitudes
[1:07:34] there's no number
[1:07:36] multitudes un you can't count
[1:07:39] them but you see 24
[1:07:42] Elders you see 144,000 you see two
[1:07:45] witnesses there's always a number
[1:07:49] right so God's going to give
[1:07:52] grace to the Jews
[1:07:56] he's going to save them just like he
[1:07:59] saved
[1:08:00] us right they are going to be going to
[1:08:02] the Millennium the same way we
[1:08:06] are they're not going to be bride I said
[1:08:08] this they're going the same way
[1:08:11] everybody with me but right now they
[1:08:13] can't do
[1:08:15] that they rejected Christ they rejected
[1:08:18] the Messiah somewhere that's got to be
[1:08:19] reconciled back right so there is a
[1:08:22] specific number of time to do that
[1:08:26] because they're Jews so everybody with
[1:08:28] me now so let's read Daniel
[1:08:31] 9 at the beginning of thy supplication
[1:08:34] the Commandment came forth now Dad read
[1:08:36] this a long time ago way he went way
[1:08:37] back before before he started Daniel 70
[1:08:39] weeks we may do that too but Daniel was
[1:08:42] the one that said oh God I want to know
[1:08:44] how much time we have left right prayed
[1:08:48] for long periods of time fasted for a
[1:08:50] long period of time and then finally
[1:08:54] Gabriel shows up
[1:08:57] and this is Gabriel talking to Daniel
[1:08:59] right here at the beginning of thy
[1:09:02] supplication just remember if your
[1:09:04] prayer is sincere God's not just at the
[1:09:07] end of
[1:09:08] it God's at Hallelujah God's at the
[1:09:11] beginning of it he's the one that gives
[1:09:13] you utterance and unction to
[1:09:16] pray do we pray just in our own self
[1:09:20] no we have to be we have to have an
[1:09:22] unction that says hey pray for this
[1:09:24] person or somebody calls or somebody
[1:09:26] gives us leaves us a text message hey
[1:09:28] pray and then you in your heart you stop
[1:09:30] and you say God well now you want to
[1:09:32] pray for that person come
[1:09:33] on you want to pray for that person
[1:09:35] specifically if God had to put that on
[1:09:37] your heart I don't care if it come
[1:09:39] through text WhatsApp or whatever it was
[1:09:41] a communication that got you into a
[1:09:44] channel to pray for somebody am I am I
[1:09:47] right that's right so Daniel wanted to
[1:09:50] know he had been in captivity for 68
[1:09:53] years Daniel had been in captivity and
[1:09:57] he knew that he only had a certain
[1:09:59] period of time here here we go time
[1:10:01] certain period of time and it was going
[1:10:03] to get out now what's going to
[1:10:04] happen Lord I want to know what's going
[1:10:07] to happen to my
[1:10:08] people two more years they were really
[1:10:11] in captivity sure enough 70 years right
[1:10:14] right right ended up being 400 and
[1:10:16] something years later
[1:10:17] on all right so this is this is a desire
[1:10:22] of a man's heart for his people
[1:10:25] to know what's going to happen to my
[1:10:28] people all right
[1:10:31] amen so now Daniel 9:23 at the beginning
[1:10:35] of thy supplications the Commandment
[1:10:37] came forth in other words
[1:10:40] what Gabriel got it from God to go tell
[1:10:45] Daniel what's going to
[1:10:48] happen and I am come to show thee for
[1:10:52] thou art greatly beloved good way to get
[1:10:55] started started therefore be confused
[1:10:58] with the
[1:10:59] matter no it says therefore understand
[1:11:03] the matter right so whatever's coming
[1:11:07] from Gabriel Brother Aaron is not
[1:11:09] confusion that's right because this is
[1:11:12] Gabriel talking to Daniel the whole time
[1:11:15] amen it's not Daniel talking it's
[1:11:17] Gabriel talking amen and consider the
[1:11:20] vision now watch now here we go
[1:11:26] if it's in the Bible it's got to be
[1:11:28] explained as the Bible explains it right
[1:11:30] amen right cuz see where everybody gets
[1:11:33] in trouble is they say well brother
[1:11:35] randam said this he can't say anything
[1:11:37] contrary to the
[1:11:39] Bible or he's a false prophet right
[1:11:43] right he can't right he cannot change
[1:11:48] the Bible he can give us Clarity he can
[1:11:52] put it in his right place but this is to
[1:11:54] the Jew CH this is in its right place
[1:11:58] you just got to understand
[1:12:00] it so 70 weeks are determined I'm going
[1:12:03] to break this down in a minute 70 weeks
[1:12:05] are determined what what is that word
[1:12:08] determined it's going to happen this is
[1:12:11] what's got to happen 70 weeks are going
[1:12:14] to happen upon thy people and upon thy
[1:12:17] Holy City to do six things finish the
[1:12:21] transgression make an end of sins make
[1:12:24] reconcil ation for iniquity bringing
[1:12:26] Everlasting righteousness seal up the
[1:12:28] vision and prophecy and anoint the most
[1:12:31] holy so 70 weeks inside of that 70 weeks
[1:12:36] put your little put your little
[1:12:38] parentheses inside of that those six
[1:12:40] things have got to
[1:12:42] happen all right all right verse 25 know
[1:12:47] therefore and understand that from the
[1:12:49] going forth of the Commandment to
[1:12:51] restore and build Jerusalem unto the
[1:12:53] Messiah the prince shall be seven
[1:12:56] weeks all right everybody with me amen
[1:13:00] and three score and two
[1:13:02] weeks that's two distinct periods right
[1:13:04] everybody with me a 7we
[1:13:07] period and a 62 three score six 62 weeks
[1:13:12] the street shall be built again in the
[1:13:13] wall even in troublous times so from
[1:13:16] Darius and and all the all the Ms and
[1:13:19] Persians way back over here the edict
[1:13:21] came for them to rebuild the Temple it
[1:13:23] took them that period of time to rebuild
[1:13:24] the Temple
[1:13:25] and for Jesus to show up at the end of
[1:13:28] those 62
[1:13:29] weeks unto Messiah the prince that's
[1:13:32] Jesus right
[1:13:35] right and after not

[1:13:40] minute and after 62
[1:13:45] weeks shall Messiah be cut
[1:13:48] off now we're going to go eat after we
[1:13:51] leave this building we're not eating
[1:13:53] now right it's after so after these 62
[1:13:57] weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not
[1:14:00] for himself who was he cut off for us
[1:14:02] right all right amen and the people of
[1:14:05] the prince that shall come shall destroy
[1:14:07] the city and Sanctuary now that is Titus
[1:14:10] in 870 destroyed the temple took it
[1:14:13] apart and took it back to Rome right all
[1:14:16] right that's according to history right
[1:14:19] and the end therefore shall be with the
[1:14:20] flood remember the flood ran out the
[1:14:22] gate they killed everybody they they
[1:14:24] they walled up Jerusalem wouldn't let
[1:14:26] nobody out they ate to bark off the
[1:14:28] trees they ate their own kids
[1:14:30] right and therefore shall be with the
[1:14:32] flood and until the end of the war
[1:14:34] desolations are
[1:14:37] determined now if we've got we'll break
[1:14:40] it down in a minute but look we've got s

[1:14:55] don't go quoting brother random to me he
[1:14:57] knew what he was talking about and I
[1:14:59] know what he was talking about brother
[1:15:01] Dale and everybody sit in this building
[1:15:02] pretty much knows what he was talking
[1:15:03] about there's a mystery in there right
[1:15:06] that's right cuz you can't make the
[1:15:08] Bible anything different
[1:15:13] right and after three score and two
[1:15:15] weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not
[1:15:17] for himself what it was for us and the
[1:15:20] people of the prince shall come shall
[1:15:22] destroy the city which was Titus the
[1:15:24] Romans they destroyed it took it back to
[1:15:26] Rome and the end therefore shall be with
[1:15:27] the flood until the end of the war
[1:15:29] desolations are determined and he shall
[1:15:31] confirm the Covenant with many
[1:15:34] for one week we had
[1:15:38] 69 now we got one more week makes 70
[1:15:42] there are no half weeks in the Bible of
[1:15:44] Daniel 70 weeks not one that's right not
[1:15:48] one people in the message want to find
[1:15:50] it for me just find it in the
[1:15:53] Bible don't give me a quote I want the
[1:15:56] Bible cuz the quote's got to fit the
[1:15:58] Bible the Bible don't fit the
[1:16:00] quote and he shall confirm the Covenant
[1:16:03] with many for one week and in the midst
[1:16:05] of the week he shall cause the sacrifice
[1:16:07] and oblation to cease we'll talk about
[1:16:09] that in just a second and for the
[1:16:10] overspreading of abomination he shall
[1:16:12] make it desolate even unto the cons what
[1:16:14] is the
[1:16:15] consummation destroying everything right
[1:16:18] amen and that determine shall be poured
[1:16:20] out upon the desolate you know brother
[1:16:22] Ram told us that we couldn't understand
[1:16:24] a seals unless you understood Daniel 70
[1:16:26] weeks well if you don't understand
[1:16:27] Daniel 7 if you understand it like most
[1:16:29] people in the message understand it you
[1:16:31] can't put the woes in there the vows the
[1:16:33] plagues you got them all happening some
[1:16:35] other time
[1:16:37] right and we'll get into that later on
[1:16:39] when we get into Daniel 70 weeks we'll
[1:16:41] go all the way to the Future home so now
[1:16:44] look so now let's stop now everybody
[1:16:46] open your
[1:16:48] eyes 70
[1:16:50] weeks how do you know that's 490 years
[1:16:55] brother Bram said that a't that that
[1:16:58] doesn't that doesn't help me
[1:17:01] none he got to be in the Bible yes sir
[1:17:04] all right so let's put let's just hold
[1:17:06] on for a minute let's go to Genesis
[1:17:09] 29:26
[1:17:11] laan con
[1:17:13] man conning a con man cuz what he done
[1:17:17] he said I'll give you Rachel gave him
[1:17:19] Leah on the wedding night I don't know
[1:17:22] how that happened must have been real
[1:17:23] dark
[1:17:25] correct so Jacob comes out and says
[1:17:28] you've tricked
[1:17:29] me I asked for Rachel I love
[1:17:32] her and then laan says it must not be so
[1:17:36] done in our country to give the younger
[1:17:37] before the firstborn he didn't have
[1:17:39] enough gumption to say hey buddy you got
[1:17:41] to marry this one first on the wedding
[1:17:43] night what he done is he switched the
[1:17:45] girls right don't ever try
[1:17:50] that watch what he said
[1:17:53] though fulfill
[1:17:55] her
[1:17:57] weak and we will give thee this also for
[1:18:00] the service which Thou shalt serve with
[1:18:02] me yet seven other
[1:18:04] years and Jacob did so and fulfilled her
[1:18:08] week if you keep reading them down the
[1:18:10] Bible that's seven years he worked seven
[1:18:13] years to get the right
[1:18:15] girl listen this guy was in love with
[1:18:18] Rachel cuz he worked seven years and got
[1:18:22] tricked that's right then he worked and
[1:18:25] said well dude you got to work seven
[1:18:26] more and you get the right one what a
[1:18:28] con man so he went ahead and worked
[1:18:31] seven more years he fulfilled her week
[1:18:33] so one week equals seven years in the
[1:18:36] Bible all
[1:18:39] right and I know it was a revelation God
[1:18:41] took him to that
[1:18:43] scripture but he brother R just didn't
[1:18:45] pull stuff out of the air it had to be a
[1:18:48] Bible prophet he had to have it in the
[1:18:50] Bible amen okay so now one week equals
[1:18:54] 7even
[1:18:55] Years everybody with me so 70 weeks 70 *
[1:19:01] 7 is
[1:19:03] 490
[1:19:05] years I know some of us went to school
[1:19:08] and made it through and you can add that
[1:19:10] up and divide it and subtract it and
[1:19:12] multiply it but 70 * 7 is 490 years so
[1:19:19] it's going to take 490 years for God to
[1:19:23] restore Israel that's right exactly okay
[1:19:28] here's your bracket 490
[1:19:32] years 70 weeks or 490 years are
[1:19:35] determined and that word determined
[1:19:37] means
[1:19:38] decreed upon thy people who is that the
[1:19:42] Jews right and upon thy Holy City
[1:19:44] Jerusalem here's what people in the
[1:19:46] message get it all mixed up it's to two
[1:19:49] sets of of of situations right it's to
[1:19:52] Daniel's people and to build the city
[1:19:55] back
[1:19:56] right right and it won't be built back
[1:19:59] right till they in the Millennium till
[1:20:01] the mill till right before the
[1:20:02] Millennium and we'll get into that later
[1:20:03] on then there's six things that God's
[1:20:06] going to do through two
[1:20:11] prophets right amen God had to send them
[1:20:13] a prophet he didn't send them a preacher
[1:20:16] he sent them a prophet he's going to
[1:20:17] send them too Moses and Elijah right and
[1:20:20] they're going to preach to finish the
[1:20:23] transgression they're going to preach to
[1:20:25] make an end of sins they're going to
[1:20:27] make reconciliation for iniquity and
[1:20:29] number four bring in Everlasting
[1:20:31] righteousness number five SEAL up
[1:20:33] division in Prophecy and number six to
[1:20:36] anoint the most holy all right everybody
[1:20:38] got it 70 weeks is 490 years that's the
[1:20:42] time it's going to take to bring Israel
[1:20:43] back 490 years right all
[1:20:47] right so one week equals 7 years we've
[1:20:50] already established that laan said
[1:20:52] fulfill her week so he fulfilled seven
[1:20:54] years
[1:20:56] Years also in Matthew 18 said Peter came
[1:20:59] to Jesus and said Lord how often should
[1:21:00] my brother sin against me and I forgive
[1:21:02] him seven times Jesus said unto him I
[1:21:04] say not unto thee un seven times but 70
[1:21:08] times seven that's he told them exactly
[1:21:12] how long it would take to get Israel
[1:21:14] back to where they're supposed to be
[1:21:16] amen amen so he's going to forgive them
[1:21:18] 70 time 7 490
[1:21:22] years all right now look follow me real
[1:21:25] fast know therefore and understand that
[1:21:28] from the going forth of the Commandment
[1:21:30] to restore and build Jerusalem we'll get
[1:21:32] into that there was there was some
[1:21:34] people Nehemiah different ones coming
[1:21:35] and said look we need a temple amen we
[1:21:38] need a city with walls right and they
[1:21:41] built a city with walls but they built
[1:21:44] it in troubless times because they had a
[1:21:45] trial in one hand and a sword in the
[1:21:47] other that's right cuz all the neighbors
[1:21:49] knew if they built that City back God
[1:21:51] was going to be in that City or that
[1:21:53] Temple right so they used a trial to
[1:21:55] build the wall and they had a sword in
[1:21:57] his hand to fight even in troubless
[1:22:00] times amen all right everybody with
[1:22:03] me so from the going forth of the
[1:22:07] Commandment to restore and to build
[1:22:11] Jerusalem the
[1:22:14] city unto the Messiah the
[1:22:17] prince which showed up in birthed in a 4
[1:22:21] ad and or 4 BC and we'll study that
[1:22:23] later on
[1:22:25] shall be seven weeks what is seven weeks
[1:22:28] 7 * 7 is 49 you can read it right there
[1:22:33] I ciphered that for you last night or
[1:22:35] this
[1:22:36] morning and three score in two weeks 62
[1:22:40] weeks time 7 is
[1:22:43] 434
[1:22:44] years is everybody with
[1:22:47] me you got
[1:22:51] it
[1:22:53] okay all right right so
[1:22:56] now the street shall be built again in
[1:22:58] the wall even in troublous times I just
[1:23:00] told you what it
[1:23:01] was so 7 weeks plus 62 weeks is how
[1:23:07] long 69 weeks right not 70 not 69 and A2
[1:23:12] not 68 and A2 right
[1:23:15] 69 so 69 * 7 if you got 69 weeks one
[1:23:20] week equals 7 years 69 * 7 is 483 we
[1:23:26] need
[1:23:27] 490
[1:23:29] right and what's
[1:23:32] 483 or what's 490 minus
[1:23:35] 483 it ain't three and a
[1:23:38] half seven one full week
[1:23:41] left as of today right there's one week
[1:23:46] left to go to the
[1:23:48] Jews but now
[1:23:51] brother I'm GNA tell you this real real
[1:23:53] quick I don't care what he said if it
[1:23:55] ain't in the
[1:23:58] Bible and I'll tell anybody that it's
[1:24:01] got to be in the Bible if he was a Bible
[1:24:04] prophet he had to match the Bible the
[1:24:06] Bible don't match his
[1:24:07] quote I'm sorry that may be plain but I
[1:24:10] know God if brother Randon was standing
[1:24:12] right here he'd say that ain't nothing
[1:24:13] but the truth cuz he's the one that said
[1:24:16] it so 69 * 7 is
[1:24:20] 483 the goal is 70 weeks are 490
[1:24:28] years so after 62 weeks Messiah was cut
[1:24:31] off everybody with
[1:24:35] me and after three score and two weeks
[1:24:37] shall Messiah be cut off but not for
[1:24:40] himself and the people of the prince
[1:24:42] shall come and destroy the city we read
[1:24:45] that so at that time when Christ
[1:24:49] died the Jews said let his blood be on
[1:24:52] us and our children they They Crucified
[1:24:55] him they they put him on the
[1:24:57] cross all right but they did it for me
[1:25:00] and
[1:25:01] you he is now turning to a gentile age
[1:25:05] of approximately 2,000 years the church
[1:25:08] ages we just got finished where we're in
[1:25:10] the seventh all right so Christ died
[1:25:14] come back on the day of Pentecost and
[1:25:16] there's been 2,000 years and then we're
[1:25:18] getting ready to close it off and then
[1:25:20] what's going to
[1:25:22] happen what's going to happen
[1:25:26] cuz brother R is and I'm emphatic on
[1:25:29] this we're not going to see the
[1:25:32] Antichrist in his
[1:25:34] fullness we're
[1:25:36] gone we're gone when he becomes
[1:25:38] incarnate in a man we're gone that's
[1:25:41] right so he now here's verse 27 let's
[1:25:45] find where that next week is we got to
[1:25:46] have one more
[1:25:50] week and
[1:25:52] he now remember that he you could say
[1:25:55] well that's Christ this he breaks a
[1:25:59] covenant Christ never breaks covenants
[1:26:02] man breaks
[1:26:04] covenants so this guy's going to break a
[1:26:07] covenant therefore he is
[1:26:09] Antichrist that's right and he
[1:26:12] Antichrist shall confirm the Covenant
[1:26:14] with many for one week or seven
[1:26:21] years and in the midst of the week which
[1:26:24] is 3 and 1/2 years that's right he shall
[1:26:27] cause the sacrifice and oblation to
[1:26:29] cease he's standing in the temple
[1:26:31] telling Israel he's God right amen
[1:26:36] right and they still time left
[1:26:40] right cuz there got to be one week left
[1:26:43] after we gone not three and a half there
[1:26:45] the only three and a half years of
[1:26:46] ministry
[1:26:48] absolutely but to finish time on the
[1:26:50] earth of that 490 years to put them in
[1:26:53] the Millennium you can't can't stop it
[1:26:55] at the battle of
[1:27:00] Armageddon prove it to
[1:27:03] me prove it to me cuz I'll tell you
[1:27:07] something the whole the whole thing if
[1:27:09] you want to get the whole Gest of Daniel
[1:27:11] 70 weeks go back to the sixfold
[1:27:14] purpose yes sir go to the sixf purpose
[1:27:17] and really read it if there's only three
[1:27:19] and A2 years left listen to me if
[1:27:21] there's only three as people say there
[1:27:23] are there's not
[1:27:24] there's only three and a half years of
[1:27:25] ministry
[1:27:27] left but those six things if they're all
[1:27:30] done in that three and a half year
[1:27:31] period before the battle of Armageddon
[1:27:35] you've built a Temple You've anointed
[1:27:37] the most holy and now you've destroyed
[1:27:41] it
[1:27:48] hello but brother R's totally correct
[1:27:50] there's only three and a half years of
[1:27:51] Jesus's Ministry left that's right
[1:27:54] that's in the Bible 1260
[1:27:56] days but you got to separate that from
[1:27:58] the one week left because brother randam
[1:28:00] in the 70 weeks of Daniel the last thing
[1:28:03] he preached was the 70th
[1:28:05] week and he said seven times that
[1:28:08] there's one week left after the Rapture
[1:28:10] right all right oh well they say well he
[1:28:12] got this new revelation when he when he
[1:28:14] U the seals open that's okay but that
[1:28:18] new revelation better match this it
[1:28:21] better match the Bible or it's wrong and
[1:28:23] it did they just weren't understanding
[1:28:25] he's talking about a week of Messiah
[1:28:27] Ministry three and A2 years over here
[1:28:29] three and A2 years here over there when
[1:28:31] Jesus then three and a half years here
[1:28:34] yes that incompasses all the Daniel 70
[1:28:36] weeks to those six those three and a
[1:28:37] half and three and a half but to finish
[1:28:40] time
[1:28:42] time Jews and City remember that Jews
[1:28:46] and
[1:28:47] city right right there's got to be seven
[1:28:51] years left after the Rapture right
[1:28:54] cuz it says right here and he shall make
[1:28:56] a CO confirm the Covenant of many for
[1:28:58] one week I had a brother tell me the
[1:29:00] other day he said well now brother R
[1:29:02] said the Messiah was cut off in the
[1:29:03] midst of the week show it to me in the
[1:29:08] Bible show it to him in the
[1:29:11] Bible you got about you can have all day
[1:29:15] you can call me next
[1:29:18] week so then brother R's not talking
[1:29:20] about that
[1:29:21] week he's talking about he was cut off
[1:29:24] in the week of the midst of the week of
[1:29:26] the Messiah Ministry of Jesus
[1:29:28] Christ there's your
[1:29:30] mystery that brother Dale saw in
[1:29:33] 1974 and been preaching it ever since I
[1:29:36] I I'll stand up in front of
[1:29:39] anybody I see this but you can't get it
[1:29:43] wrong cuz listen if there's only three
[1:29:45] and a half years left where you going to
[1:29:47] put the last wo the last wo is the third
[1:29:50] world war that's
[1:29:52] right the V got to be poured out during
[1:29:55] the tribulation
[1:29:57] period we'll get to
[1:30:01] it so let's read one more
[1:30:04] time then we'll get ready for communion
[1:30:07] 70 weeks are determined there's going to
[1:30:09] be 490
[1:30:11] years until Israel is restored back and
[1:30:16] the city
[1:30:18] yes they have to have a city we
[1:30:21] don't we're Nations Tong
[1:30:26] but 70 weeks are determined upon thy
[1:30:28] people the Jews and thy Holy City
[1:30:30] Jerusalem to do six things all right now
[1:30:33] finish transgression now come with me
[1:30:34] here listen real quick two prophets are
[1:30:37] going to preach what
[1:30:40] salvation
[1:30:42] repentance for 1260
[1:30:45] days all right it's going to finish
[1:30:48] their
[1:30:49] transgression it's going to make an end
[1:30:52] of their sins
[1:30:54] and it's going to reconcile them back to
[1:30:57] Christ so that he can give them the Holy
[1:30:59] Ghost and they can go in
[1:31:01] Rapture are are catching away they're
[1:31:03] they're catching away everybody with me
[1:31:06] all right but there's three more
[1:31:08] left so if all that's got to happen in
[1:31:11] three and a half
[1:31:12] years so you going to bring in
[1:31:14] Everlasting righteousness before you
[1:31:16] destroy the
[1:31:17] Earth you going to seal up the vision
[1:31:19] and Prophecy in the people no and
[1:31:22] they're gone
[1:31:24] uh and you going to anoint the most holy
[1:31:26] you going to you going to build a temple
[1:31:27] and anoint it and then destroy
[1:31:29] it no there's your key right there the
[1:31:32] the Daniel 70 weeks the sixfold purposes
[1:31:35] three of them happen while the Jews
[1:31:37] while the two prophets are here that
[1:31:38] three and a half years and then the
[1:31:40] other three and a half years is where
[1:31:42] you're going to have the third W poured
[1:31:43] out the BS are going to be poured out
[1:31:45] there's going to be a Great Tribulation
[1:31:48] there's going to be a a battle of
[1:31:50] Armageddon
[1:31:54] then the Jews are going to come back
[1:31:56] according to Ezekiel 40:44 they're going
[1:31:58] to build a temple back yeah to finish
[1:32:02] the 70th week of Daniel and put us put
[1:32:06] them in the Millennium and they we come
[1:32:07] Revelations 19 we come into the temple
[1:32:12] and brother Brown said to anoint the
[1:32:13] most holy was when we the bride enters
[1:32:17] into the
[1:32:18] temple now how is that going to happen
[1:32:21] in just three and a half years and then
[1:32:22] the battle of Armageddon is going to
[1:32:23] destroy the Temple we're supposed to go
[1:32:27] into right it's so simple that confounds
[1:32:30] 99% of the people in this message just
[1:32:32] because of a couple quotes brother
[1:32:33] randam said and I'm not you know as I
[1:32:36] well as I do brother randam was not
[1:32:38] wrong he knew what he was talking about
[1:32:41] we just don't
[1:32:43] right he knew what the Bible
[1:32:45] said but he also knew that that was to
[1:32:48] the Jews and to get to get away from all
[1:32:51] the peripherals he said all right
[1:32:53] there's three and a/ half years of
[1:32:54] Jesus's Ministry over here he was cut
[1:32:56] off in the midst of that week amen then
[1:32:59] there's three and A2 years more for the
[1:33:04] Jews that's your whole 70 weeks of
[1:33:06] Daniel it's the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:33:08] but it's a one week Messiah Ministry and
[1:33:12] that's what brother Brown was talking
[1:33:13] about when somebody said something over
[1:33:14] here in the seals he said no no no n n n
[1:33:16] that's not what I said well now what the
[1:33:18] brother said is exactly what brother R
[1:33:20] said right don't get quiet on me right
[1:33:24] exactly son man talking about son of yes
[1:33:28] that's the son of man he well he
[1:33:30] preached he preached it
[1:33:32] himself we're getting that right now
[1:33:35] we're getting that Ministry well that's
[1:33:36] then going to go the baby's going to be
[1:33:38] born and then we're going to give the
[1:33:40] baby remember the story of of U Boaz and
[1:33:45] Ruth they have a
[1:33:48] baby Boaz Ruth was a
[1:33:51] gentile Boaz was type of
[1:33:54] Christ they
[1:33:56] marry they have a baby what do they do
[1:33:59] with that baby they give
[1:34:02] it they give it to Naomi the Jewish Mama
[1:34:06] this message is so real it's going to go
[1:34:08] to them and they're going to see Christ
[1:34:10] I want to know though that we they see
[1:34:12] Christ in us
[1:34:14] now do they see Christ in us
[1:34:19] now so there's your Daniel 7 we
[1:34:24] right there's seven years left after the
[1:34:25] Rapture to finish the time of Daniel 70
[1:34:28] weeks the people and the city there's
[1:34:31] only three and a half years Ministry
[1:34:32] left absolutely because that's what the
[1:34:34] Bible says right but you've got to get
[1:34:37] them in a
[1:34:40] temple and then that Temple is Anointed
[1:34:42] with something in brother brandom if we
[1:34:44] believe he was a prophet he said we are
[1:34:46] the anointing to the temple right now do
[1:34:48] we come back in the middle of battle of
[1:34:49] Armageddon
[1:34:51] no we come back in Revelations 19 riding
[1:34:54] into the Millennium in that Temple that
[1:34:56] the Jews are how they going to do it I
[1:34:58] don't know but brother R said one thing
[1:35:00] he said Gentiles don't know how to build
[1:35:02] a temple and we don't need one Jews know
[1:35:05] how to build a temple you read Ezekiel
[1:35:08] 40-44 it is specifically a certain
[1:35:11] length a certain height a certain color
[1:35:14] a certain this a certain that we're not
[1:35:17] going to build it those Jews are going
[1:35:19] to build it somehow that 144,000 that
[1:35:22] has died is going to come back and make
[1:35:25] that Temple somebody's got to we
[1:35:29] can't we come back into the Millennium
[1:35:31] so what puts the Jews in the Millennium
[1:35:33] puts us in the
[1:35:35] Millennium cuz you and I got to be the
[1:35:37] same way he's got to finish our
[1:35:41] transgression because we're spiritual
[1:35:43] Israel amen so this happens to us
[1:35:45] spiritually
[1:35:47] right make an end of whose sin make an
[1:35:49] end of our sin make reconciliation for
[1:35:52] our iniquity
[1:35:55] bringing Everlasting
[1:35:56] righteousness if you're born again
[1:35:59] you're there amen seal up the vision and
[1:36:02] prophecy what in a group of people that
[1:36:05] nobody's going to understand nobody's
[1:36:07] going to understand the vision and
[1:36:08] prophecy except you and me right and
[1:36:11] then he anoints us and you know what he
[1:36:12] anoints us with he anoints us with a
[1:36:14] getting out of his
[1:36:16] Spirit to anoint the most holy the most
[1:36:19] holy is the one that took a
[1:36:21] resurrection and Ascension
[1:36:24] that's right oh there's a different one
[1:36:26] no the most holy is Jesus Christ but now
[1:36:30] he's decided that it's going to be him
[1:36:31] inside of a group of people and he's
[1:36:33] going to raise us up the same way he's
[1:36:35] going to physically raise the Jews up

[1:42:54] scripture if you'll pull it up for I
[1:42:56] have received of the Lord that which I
[1:42:57] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:42:59] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:43:00] he took bread and when he had give
[1:43:02] thanks he break it and said take eat
[1:43:04] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:43:06] this do in remembrance of me after the
[1:43:08] same manner he also took the cup and
[1:43:10] when he up saying this cup is what we
[1:43:12] were talking about a few minutes ago
[1:43:13] this is the New Testament this is going
[1:43:15] to be my blood not the blood of bus and
[1:43:17] goats it's going to be my blood I can
[1:43:20] actually die and the life that I have
[1:43:22] inside of me me I can divide myself into
[1:43:25] a group of
[1:43:26] people and it's
[1:43:28] me like God say it's me I can divide
[1:43:31] myself Jesus is fixing to say I'm going
[1:43:33] to divide myself into a group of people
[1:43:36] this cup is the New Testament in my
[1:43:38] blood this do you as often as you drink
[1:43:39] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[1:43:42] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:43:43] you do show the Lord's death till he
[1:43:45] come that's why it's important to take
[1:43:48] communion it's an ordinance that's never
[1:43:50] been done away with that's the first
[1:43:52] thing we're going to do when we get to
[1:43:53] the manage supper we're going to take
[1:43:55] communion wherefore whosoever shall eat
[1:43:58] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:43:59] Lord unworthily you got something in
[1:44:01] your heart in your mind shall be guilty
[1:44:03] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[1:44:05] let a man examine
[1:44:06] himself you can literally clean your
[1:44:09] slate
[1:44:10] today hello somebody you can clean your
[1:44:14] slate by a prayer of
[1:44:18] repentance and God will never remember
[1:44:20] it no more that's right
[1:44:23] sometimes we don't know the power of
[1:44:27] repentance am you just don't know the
[1:44:29] power power of repentance yet we all
[1:44:32] don't so
[1:44:34] anyway wherefore whosoever shall eat
[1:44:37] this bread and drink of this cup of the
[1:44:38] Lord unworthy shall be guilty of the
[1:44:39] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:44:41] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:44:44] that bread and drink of that he didn't
[1:44:45] say examine yourself and then leave the
[1:44:49] building so let him eat of the bread and
[1:44:51] drink of that cup
[1:44:54] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:44:55] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:44:57] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:45:00] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:45:02] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[1:45:04] we would judge ourselves we should not
[1:45:06] be judged why but we are judged we're
[1:45:08] chasing of the Lord if you judged
[1:45:11] yourself today you judge yourself
[1:45:13] unrighteous hello if you judged yourself
[1:45:17] I did this I did that I got this ought I
[1:45:19] don't believe this I got this I don't
[1:45:21] want to be here I don't
[1:45:24] amen but when we are judged we're
[1:45:27] chasing of our of not our
[1:45:31] neighbor we're chasen of the Lord who
[1:45:33] knows all
[1:45:35] things that we should not be condemned
[1:45:38] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:45:40] when you come together to eat t one for
[1:45:42] another If any man hunger let him eat at
[1:45:44] home that you come not together under
[1:45:46] condemnation and Paul said the rest I'll
[1:45:48] set in order when I come so let's just

[1:49:08] formality just as a gift were given to
[1:49:10] keep every to keep the church clean I
[1:49:12] believe this this is checking up time it
[1:49:13] gives us time to check up it gives you
[1:49:15] time to stand there for a few minutes
[1:49:17] and
[1:49:18] say you know some some some first
[1:49:22] Sundays
[1:49:23] somebody said in your mind you're going
[1:49:26] I've had a good
[1:49:27] month I've had a good month I don't know
[1:49:30] that I've made anybody mad pray for
[1:49:35] me that's 30
[1:49:41] days but you feel
[1:49:43] satisfied that you've done the right
[1:49:45] thing that you've cleaned your slate up
[1:49:48] and we may have another we may have a
[1:49:50] bad slate come next November
[1:49:53] but at least we've cleaned it or not in
[1:49:55] December lord it's already
[1:49:57] November but at least we've had a
[1:49:59] checking up time amen and we can go
[1:50:02] forward and say Lord I've done you know
[1:50:04] what take him to task say Lord I've done
[1:50:07] what you told me to
[1:50:10] do and don't be mean don't be say I
[1:50:13] expect you but expect them to do
[1:50:15] something wonderful in your life cuz he
[1:50:18] told us to do this till he come he told
[1:50:20] us this was a new testament in his blood
[1:50:23] he told us this ordinance this one foot
[1:50:25] washing water baptism are the three
[1:50:26] major ones to do and we sure appreciate
[1:50:29] that that God sent a prophet to tell us
[1:50:31] that we don't need to eat gra drink
[1:50:32] grape juice cuz it gets old we don't
[1:50:36] need to put leavon and have loaf bread
[1:50:38] and
[1:50:40] crackers but made it with unle bread
[1:50:42] made with holy hands made by somebody
[1:50:45] that knows what they're
[1:50:46] doing that part I think we got
[1:50:49] right so let's just keep working on
[1:50:51] everything else come
[1:50:53] morning I'll walk by the river how
[1:50:58] peaceful I'll rest NE the Ever Green
[1:51:06] Tree I'll
[1:51:08] carry my cross through the
[1:51:14] midnight come morning is
[1:51:17] Glory for
[1:51:21] me sometimes I'm
[1:51:24] despised and
[1:51:27] rejected and I question oh
[1:51:32] Father how long it won't be
[1:51:36] long then I take one more look at Mount
[1:51:43] Calvary and it gives me the strength to
[1:51:49] go
[1:51:50] on you know we've
[1:51:53] I was talking to brother Isaac a couple
[1:51:56] days ago and he's he's trying to uh do a
[1:52:00] little service on the uh crucifixion in
[1:52:03] the days and all that
[1:52:07] and in history you know we we have
[1:52:11] 24-hour days
[1:52:12] right so do the
[1:52:15] Jews but it's not at
[1:52:18] midnight because the Bible says the
[1:52:21] evening and the morning was the first
[1:52:22] day day right so their new day starts at
[1:52:25] 6:00
[1:52:26] p.m. soon as it get sun getting ready to
[1:52:28] go down 600 p.m. it starts a new day
[1:52:30] from that from 6 until 6 the next day 24
[1:52:35] hours
[1:52:37] is uh would be Saturday Jesus was
[1:52:40] crucified he wasn't crucified on
[1:52:42] Saturday he was crucified on Friday he
[1:52:44] wasn't crucified on Thursday he was
[1:52:47] crucified on Friday cuz that's why they
[1:52:49] call it good
[1:52:51] Friday so
[1:52:53] 3 hour to 3 hour to 6 Hour 3 hours on
[1:52:56] the cross that's why that that um and
[1:52:59] you have to you kind have to wrap it
[1:53:01] around your head CU we always think 12
[1:53:03] is is the next
[1:53:04] day well 6:00 the day you got crucified
[1:53:08] when it hit that six o' time that was
[1:53:11] the
[1:53:12] Sabbath that was
[1:53:14] Saturday ye even though they were in the
[1:53:17] Friday day that we would say
[1:53:19] Friday we would wait till midnight and
[1:53:21] it would be Saturday it started at 6:00
[1:53:24] that's why Joseph of
[1:53:27] armas said we need to get his body down
[1:53:31] that's why they were so fast and get CU
[1:53:33] if not if it would have been 6:01 p.m.
[1:53:37] you don't work on the Sabbath he would
[1:53:39] have hung there until the first day of
[1:53:41] the
[1:53:42] week okay so before 6 o' he was off that
[1:53:46] cross and in a
[1:53:48] tomb so he died on
[1:53:50] Friday stayed in the grave on on
[1:53:52] Saturday resurrected on Sunday morning
[1:53:55] it's not three total full days but it
[1:53:57] was within three
[1:53:58] days Friday before 6:00 Saturday then
[1:54:03] Sunday morning first day of the week
[1:54:07] that's when the resurrection happened so
[1:54:08] thank God for a prophet and thank God
[1:54:10] for just some history that'll tell us
[1:54:11] that that their day starts at
[1:54:13] 6:00 all right so let's take communion
[1:54:23] thank you
[1:54:34] Lord cuz it is a little confusing I told
[1:54:37] him I said find a chart draw you draw
[1:54:40] you a chart draw you a day chart you
[1:54:43] know and he sent it to me just a little
[1:54:45] while

[1:54:52] church group they're doing all right and
[1:54:54] I'm glad that we can that brother Aaron
[1:54:56] and him had a chance to go up and be
[1:54:57] with them and uh if anybody else wants
[1:55:00] to go up and be with them sure go right
[1:55:02] ahead cuz uh I think they got they got a
[1:55:05] hunger and a Zeal for
[1:55:07] God and U and they got a lot of uh
[1:55:11] adversity
[1:55:15] but we are made better with
[1:55:19] adversity we are made better with trial
[1:55:22] s and tribulations ain't that what the
[1:55:24] Bible says the footsteps of a righteous
[1:55:27] man order the Lord and He will have
[1:55:31] trouble he will have trouble I promise
[1:55:34] you he will so let's read the foot
[1:55:35] washing scripture and then we'll we'll
[1:55:37] continue on God bless you thank you for
[1:55:39] for being tentative
[1:55:41] today supper being ended the devil
[1:55:43] having now put in the heart of Judas his
[1:55:45] carot Simon's son to betray him Jesus
[1:55:47] knowing that the father had given all
[1:55:49] things into his hands and he was come
[1:55:50] from God and he went to God
[1:55:54] I hope we realize that after he took
[1:55:56] communion he realized he come from God
[1:55:58] and went to God
[1:56:00] you did you get a revelation of
[1:56:02] that should happen to you same way he
[1:56:06] rises from supper and laid aside His
[1:56:07] Garment and took a tow and girded
[1:56:08] himself after that he pth water into a
[1:56:11] basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:56:12] feet and to W him with a towel where
[1:56:14] withth he was girded then cometh he to
[1:56:16] Simon Peter and Peter said 'lord do thou
[1:56:18] wash my feet Jesus said unto him what I

[1:56:22] you'd never know it he saidou won't know
[1:56:24] it now but Thou shalt know
[1:56:27] Hereafter when the Holy Ghost fell on

[1:56:33] wash my feet Jesus answered and said if
[1:56:34] I wash thee not thou H has no part with
[1:56:36] me Simon Peter said Lord not only my
[1:56:39] feet but also my hands not my feet only
[1:56:42] but also my hands and my head Jesus said
[1:56:45] he that is washed he is not saved to
[1:56:47] wash his feet but is clean every with
[1:56:49] and you are clean but not all for in you
[1:56:52] who should betray him he was the only
[1:56:53] one in that room that knew that nobody

[1:56:58] loved Judas they liked him he did all
[1:56:59] the work for him he had the money and he
