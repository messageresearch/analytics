be Friday at 12: and uh you know we really we really will miss brother Tom but uh you know we understand too that some of us are going to go on and go by the grave and that's no embarrassment it's a wonderful thing that's right cuz he told Brother Don Donnie there he said there I believe it was Monday he said I'm just about 20 ft right over there that was you know he was looking and and seeing things different so we appreciate it and uh so we just you know we'll have a a few moments of Silent prayer in just a moment when we get through uh with the announcements but remember that and remember the fellowship meeting starting Saturday 3:30 and then we will have brother for there with us and he'll be with us for the weekend so we're asking if you will to everybody in in your seat and area if you will clean up a little bit it would help you know take up the books the extra papers the the things you've got with you uh try to clean up a little bit in your area uh cuz you probably won't be sitting there so somebody else is going to see what you've left so kind of clean up and you know and that way we won't have to write a name and put on it you know and say brother klie sit here you know but just just try to clean up a little bit and that'll help June and everything in doing for the for the meeting but we we really looking forward to the weekend that's right you know so Ephesians 1 and 2 Peter let's just have a few moments of Silent prayer just in honor of brother Tom and uh because we do we appreciate him 20 something years they've been here I think that's right it's on going on up towards 30 but I know it's about 84 wasn't it somewhere around 84 so that would be what about 27 I guess something and but we we really you you know appreciate all the years that we've had with him and it's like he said he said uh you know he and I would spend sometimes he had a good job and he could come over and we have talked as much as probably 6 hours out of eight you know just walking up and down the line with me there and and everything and Hauling my breakfast cuz that was the one thing everybody laughed about that he had the only uh Hollow in the plant that was a diesel because he of the job he had to do and and that they called it the six ton Hollow said there comes your breakfast it's taking a six ton Hollow to ha your breakfast and he bring down breakfast every morning and you know and then he'd go do his job and come back and we'd Fellowship together so he said one day he said brother Dale he said talk to these other people around here he said cuz me and you've had our day we've had our time of talking and you know and that was that was good you know and we did so the Lord Lord blesses and takes care we just appreciate it so let's just have a few moments of solid prayer before we go through the rest of the service in honor of of brother Tom he passed away this morning somewhere right about 4:30 so just remember that I got up at 4:24 and started that way were there yesterday but came on home and then started that away and got there and found out he passed on but uh you know that was that was all right that was you know I'd love to been sitting our side of him but that's still all right we he's not too far away that's right not too far away today so that's the point let's just have a few moments of Silent prayer before we go with a service just in honor of the time that we've had with our brother okay father we ask you to just be with the fish family Lord now in the time of our brother passing and just make everybody to realize that you know there's a better place and uh we want to go that way Lord and uh if I could have anything that I'd like to have of his would I'd like to have his eternal life right now where he's dwelling at cuz that would be a wonderful opportunity we thank you cuz you made all things possible so just be comfort in the hearts to each one Lord and bless and guide and take care of everybody Lord and we ask you now to be with us tonight as we speak about you from your word that you would come on the scene and and speak to our hearts and Lord just give us what You' have for us this night we love you and we thank you we commit it all to you now in Jesus name amen Ephesians 1 verse3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he ha made us accept in the Beloved I turn over to Second Peter CU this is going to just be the thought we'll be using tonight with this on adoption in three stages uh this is message number six and uh but I want you to think about something that that that Peter says here and look at verse chapter 1 starting verse 10 wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall why for an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly and to the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always reme in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth that's you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the word and and we'll be you'll see what I mean in a minute cuz we're going to be talking about uh this adoption but we're going to talk about present truth I told you Sunday that what we'd try to do tonight is just look through the Bible and the prophet's message and and try to see some promises that are for specifically for us you know it's good when the Bible says by Stripes I'm Healed now that's that's for everybody right that that's for everybody all right now but when it comes on down to where you're at see and and it says something like uh you know and that'll be one of the scriptures we'll get to in a minute in Malachi it says behold I send you Elijah the prophet AR you remember was it sister mey that you know was wondering about Mary and brother brandham you know and the Lord spoke to her on that scripture behold I send you Elijah the prophet all right but there are things that are specific and straight to you and I right and that's what I want us to talk about you know we as I said uh other things you read the Bible and and you can relate with the brothers and sisters down through time that have lived those days and and all like that and but yet we are in an age and a time to to bring all things to an end and to finish up and there's a lot of scriptures and and a lot of things pointing specifically down to where we are and if you remember back not too long ago I was preaching about the the the bride's book and I said if the if you want to see your your part of the Bible read the book of Revelation because that shows you the bride's part you know there the book specifically speaking to us and I was thinking coming up the road I thought what scripture would I use to and I don't know where will or not I thought what scripture would I use to preach brother Tom's funeral and I thought well I guess the best one would be related to him would be Revelation 61 about the seals cuz that was what he always tried to get everybody to see was the SE I don't know where I use it or not but I doing and I was looking as a coming up to there and I saw a big billboard it had VAB Ruth on it you know and it says that he went from a orphanage to uh what is it inducted into the Hall of Fame and I thought Lord you know well brother Tom started in an orphanage but he ain't worried about a Hall of Fame cuz he's in heaven now so that's that's a good point all right but let's get on with it now we've been trying to bring out as I said about adoption in three stages and we covered it took us quite a little bit we covered the uh the new birth because we must be born again we must come into the family of God and you know and then when we're born again then we can start a growth development and things into uh coming up through the stature of perfect man Etc and uh you know we can can come out to a place that the Bible speaks of of the manifestation of the sons of God all right then we gave you there uh this past Wednesday uh the quotes and I gave you know some back to you where brother Brandon was talking about manifestation he said what is manifestation he was talking about manifested sons of God uh 1960 uh 518 and he's he's talking about Earnest expectation the whole creation is waiting for the manifestation see the manifestation what is the manifestation making known right see basically everybody deals with manifestation as signs and wonders but I went outside there uh Sunday afternoon after speaking a while about it and people were coming up relating their own thoughts back to me you know and uh you know the word manifest is to make known we used to we had to go by manifest at work see that was what kept us in order and you doing your jobs and everything you know you've got a manifest Fest you've got a paper where it's not the work it's a paper to show you what is being done well see that's to me what I tried to get you to see that if we make God known right by speaking about him from his word and and trying to show him to the people then he'll make us known with signs and wonders so that's that's all I've ever tried to do is just just to speak about you know the things that God has made known to me and then I try to make them known to you I I want you to see my father that's the the one thing you know that I want you to see I want you to see my father because that way then he'll become your father and you know and we all have the same father but that's the point I want you to see and and I'm sorry to say but that's why that a lot of people are not seeing signs and wonders and they're questioning and they're saying well you know uh why is it not that things are taking place and we've been around here all of these years and and all of this that and the other well could it be that they haven't seed the word down in the hearts of the people you know I don't want to be so hard about that but uh you know uh to me if we make him known he can make us known right well maybe that's why that manifestation is not appearing among a lot of people is because they're not making God known right amen and and you know and and he doesn't he's not underbound right he's onon bound to his word though if we make his word known he's onon bound to make us known with the restoration of the word the prophet said we come to Restoration of power see all right he said and he sent his word what and healed us and delivered us from destruction so then it it's in the word see and let's just do that let's try to make the word manifest and then you'll see what he was saying as I gave you these quotes back to you that brother said on the message Shalom 64 he said to manifest to make known to the people the promises that he's made for this day now we're talking about present day truth see and we you know people have lived their time and all that's well and good but we're here wanting to know about present day truth in other words what is it for you and I right and that's what I want you to look at see he he's made he said manifest the light of the day the then when we do that everything will be fine then he goes on talking about how that there's but in this it but this is the day of the manifestation of sons of God this is the position in Christ uh number three coming down on your notes 196 522 the morning service but this is the day of the manifestation of the sons of God when the mystery that's been hid since the foundation of the world is to be made known this is the hour amen sure the all right I believe in miracles and signs and wonders that's what don't misunderstand me please and we can stand here all night long and talk about it and we have told you of the things that God has done among us to the dead raised the sick heel storm spoken out of existence rain called for and it came people that uh needed salvation it has been spoken and and you know there's two sitting here right now that that I told you before before Wade came back I said he'll come you know well then I told Jo one day I said don't worry about Danny I said he's coming well see it was something that that you know that you can see right and and and you know and you don't want to to uh go too far on some of the things but when it happens you know that it's true right and uh so then that way we don't have to worry God has made himself manifest Among Us with signs and wonders but I want more amen I'm not satisfied right we have sickness among us we have heartaches and troubles I want to be for the people to be delivered I want to be delivered myself you know but the main thing I want is to change of this body and I'm really jealous of brother Tom today because see he's there to where I would I want to be you know and and all but you know now he's you know what he's saying how long right you know that's what he's saying how long in other words how long is it don't take you much down there to get into it of what we've been talking about you know and all like that so it's a wonderful wonderful day but now listen let's think about it see about being established in the present day truth in other words what's exactly pointing to you and I right scriptures quotes from The Prophet that are pointing to he not just an over all view you know not just meaning for everybody right but you remember how I tried to bring it that the prophet of God said in the church 's book there that it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God that's right we come by for knowledge all right but it's the word are seed so then there was a word or seed and I gave you some quotes on that cuz I've already give them to you before four of where there's a word or seed for each age that's right now the just shall live by faith was a predestinated seed there was no way that was not going to come to pass amen that's right you agree amen I mean there it was it had to come to pass it was in God's word well all right that's what I'm trying to get you to see I want us to see what's in the word for you and me that's predestinated eternally and will take place now if we want to be a part of it see we can make our choice but if we don't want to be a part of it right then you know but I've got one in here somewhere brother around and said and if it's right he said let's go for it in other words he said but if it ain't let's get away from it right you know so that's that's a that's a good way to be all right but see it's the it's the seed or word that comes predestinated eternally amen the other is dealing by for knowledge of word the seed or word will land in each one of us well then I believe and I told you that I believe the scripture is talking about changing moment twinkl an ey I believe somebody is living right now in a body you know human body that's corre that's predestinated that it's going to be changed all right now I believe that right I believe somebody's living in a body and I've contended I'm one of them that's living in a body that's predestinated amen not just by for knowledge now right right but predestinated to be the very and and everybody Paul when he comes up he's going to come up in the body he lived in you know we know that all right but he wasn't see that was under still under the body was dealing with for knowledge but we're in the day when somebody's going to say death you're annihilated walk right into eternal life while we're right here amen not have to go up to heaven somewhere and find it that's right but while we're right here just walk right into it and doing that then wouldn't it be that that's a predestinated seed because that way Time and Eternity meet here Time and Eternity don't meet in heaven right no Time and Eternity meets right here that's right and that's why that that we're in the the Romans era of of and we'll get back to it in a minute you know of saying that the whole world is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God right all right waiting on them to make God known right and then he'll make them known that's the whole key now you you think I don't believe in signs and wonders you're you're all messed up because I I've seen too much amen you know I've seen too many things you know they not want to believe in in in Miracles right and things cuz that's you know I just believe it but the end of all things according to uh Peter I think it's 1 Peter 4:7 but he's he's talking about like the end of all things all see now when you come to the end of all things the prophet would say he Sav the best the last right that's why it says the last shall be be first and the and the first should be last why because it's all dependent upon the last part all right everything waiting on you and I see and it's the age we're living right amen and we've got to believe it that's right now when you when if you've ever been healed you know what I'm talking about that one minute you're standing there and and you don't know and you're believing and you're trying to as we call it muster up enough Faith to believe but then something just comes down and speaks to you right well it just don't make no difference brother Tom came in one morning down at work we'd always meet in the break area and he came in one morning and he said uh I'm putting uh blood through my my I think it was his vows that time I'm not certain but any I'm putting blood through and he said I'm leaving now going to the hospital and so we just gathered and we prayed well he went to the hospital and stayed over a week and they never did find out what was wrong with it why because God took it away from him you know and and we believe it because that it is God's word am all right now I I'm saying this let's see how was it right around and said on Calvary was in other words the biggest portion of the Old Testament more of the Old Testament was fulfilled in the last few hours somewhere close to that verb eight un quote than there was of the rest of the scriptures amen cuz that's what everything pointed right was to Calvary right all right now I believe everything in the Bible is pointing to you and I am I believe that so then we got a Bible to fulfill right we've got a word to be F fulfilled it's not just going to church and being good and believe the prophet's message and and help the widows and orphans and all that and all that's well and good but to recognize the prophet preached a message called what recognizing your day and its message right all right now to recognize the message is the only way we'll know our day right that's right but he did do he TI there recognizing your day right and its message the message of the day declares where you and I are at right see that but people will say but but it it you know why are we not seeing because we're doubting what God has done we're not taking what God has said and believing it R around said one person get healed he said in order to throw the entire church into desperation right well because word believe it word believe for me right because it's not sent see healing is sent for everybody but there's a word in this age for you and I to fulfill right all right and and and it's the end of all things all right and that's why I wanted to say like present day truth not yesterday's truth that's wonderful but present day today right today is the day of salvation amen and see then that way we can watch it as it unfolds to see our day and what we're seeing through the scriptures right all right that's far this day amen all right now so let's just take a few and and then we'll get a few of what the prophet has to say about it when everybody knows let's just start off with it let's start off with Malachi 4 it's a good place to start amen all right now watch verse two well let's go verse one for Behold a day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud Y and all that do wickedly shall be stoble and and the day that and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you you see you here over here today now that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings now what was that the prophet said that was a Divine Healing campaign right that went out all right now I'll be glad to show you these or we'll sit down with the computer and run them up for you but he said that was the son of righteous ring with healing he said it was a healing campaign well that happened right right see that took place to all mankind believes in it they just like we was talking last night they just don't believe in the the message the man brought they believe in all the signs and wonders all right and watch with healing in his wings and ye me me see shall go forth and grow up as caves of the stall yep all right right the message is going to come you feed calf in the stall stored up food right right y CU you're you're wanting them to fatten up and ye what shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet now each one of these I didn't do it for this message but each one of these I've got a circle around it where it says ye and where it says your feet in the day I shall do this say the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant because all of the word of the Old Testament spoke of the coming of Elijah right you said well no no it's spoke what you you don't get what I'm meaning Elijah to come in here which would be the last one of the Old Testament would be John the Baptist right all right see then every thing was pointing to that right if he didn't come forth then nothing wasn't right before then right true right but if he came forth it meant everything back there was right right all preceding every Prophet had to line up with the next Prophet right everything had to line up together all right so then that's what he's saying Remember You The Law of Moses I wrote this in my Bible all word speaks of 4 all the Old Testament spoke of Malachi 4 then all the New Testament speak of Malachi 45 you know coming on down right remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded him in h for all Israel with the statutes and judgments in other words stay with my word and I'll back it up right right God is Not Over the Sea he's not up in heaven was that what Moses said he was trying to get to people to see a present tense God right for themselves not just for him yeah right see that's what all the prophets were doing look behold I will send you amen let's read that this way let's read it together all right behold come on read with me say it with me okay behold I will send you now you're saying that to me and I'm saying it to you right right Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord that's a promise in the Bible then now they coming before the great and Dreadful day that's not John the Baptist right so that was promised to be in end time right amen all right now was there any way to stop that now you know the devil done everything he could to try to do it now we can go on with what to turn the hearts of the CH for the fathers of the children hearts of the children to their fathers showing what would happen and coming down but it's pointing down to this day right right right amen that's speaking of this day that we could say with each one of these scriptures this day this scripture is fulfilled now we have had the message of the hour right we've had the prophet to come and bring us the message right amen so now what is it it's left up to the people to take the message amen and to make the message alive in a group of people right all right so that's the present day truth yeah are you with me now let's go over then everybody know scripture but let's go over in 1 Thessalonians everybody knows the scriptures we're using but let's just let's just read them see and think about ourselves right 1 Thessalonians 4 verse 15 now watch this is pointing here you understand my point is reading scriptures it points to this day right all right not another day now CU we believe that but to recognize your day and its message we recognize the message but what about the day all right for this we say unto you who now by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain un the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep now Paul was prophesying right because Paul is not here but he was speaking it as far as he saw it it was there but he was pointing down you remember right the book of Hebrews he was trying his best to get out of the people that God was coming right then and that's what we ought to realize what he said see and we which are alive and remain now he's not here so that's a prophecy speaking of someone that will come and make that manifest y all right since for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout what is that the message right is that the way the prophet explained it the shouts the message have we had the message amen so we've had the message all right to shout with the voice of the Archangel and he said the same loud voice that raised Lazarus from the dead will speak again in the end time amen where from y he right come on with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord all right now Paul didn't fulfill that right but somebody will amen somebody will do it let's go I got one here I jumped over but excuse me let's go back to Matthew Matthew 24 Matthew 24 is a great great course all them great great but you know where you get Matthew 24 but look at 24:14 this is under the fifth seal right and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world now I know what brother brand said in the days of Paul and him and the gospel was preached to the whole world right right I know that and see so don't just say well now you just don't understand that's done been done now but it's got to be done here and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come we stopped to get a about deter today and this girl she said fixing the thing and she said uh you're a preacher aren't you and I yes ma'am she said uh you believe the world's going to end end tomorrow she said they're saying it's going to end tomorrow I said no ma'am you don't have to worry about the world ending tomorrow cuz I didn't have time to explain there got to be three and a half years after the Rapture and I'm still here so that you know I mean I didn't want to go into all that but I just said no ma'am the world's not going to end tomorrow I said they're saying all this at the calendar what it is the Mayan or what something calendar only went to 2012 so they figured it's all over with but I said there's one thing about it though there will be a date when it will come to an end right there will be a day so there'll be a day that that's fulfilled right amen well that day can't be fulfilled now that's right see somebody tells you I got a thing and I wasn't supposed to open it he wrote on it not to open it till May the 25th but I didn't hear anyway but this this brother up in Canada he sent me a message before and he said if I'm a Believer I'll really attach on to this and tell my people about it well I'm going to tell you then what he said he says that the redemption's over nobody can be saved anymore it's all finished fin the seed planting is done we're in the time of the end Gathering of the Harvest and you know coming up in what is it October long in there is the Feast of the end Gatherings etc etc you know whatever but anyhow I don't remember the exact date maybe my wife can tell me but he he put in there that they're going to have these meetings and he said the dead is already started or begins to appear Among Us and they're going to cause great Mass confusion because they're gather you know appearing around the world and everything and he said now make sure you come to this meeting in Canada because that's the end Gathering I assumed that he meant that must be the going away because if the Dead's already raised and and everything so he told me to tell you so now if you want to get the paperwork I'll give it to you and you can go to Canada and and I mean Washington excuse me Washington not Canada he's from Canada but he is Washington is supposed to appear but anyhow so I told you about it you can't argu about that point but I'm not packing up I don't know what you going to do but I'm just going to kind of bite it out and just you know believe and and all like that because you know I'm not concerned because if the dead raises it's going to be among us and I ain't going to be worried about it because I'm I'm going to be established in the present day truth see all these predictions etc etc he did say he said if it don't come to pass said you'll know it well that's a good point we know but anyhow am I'm not making Li of the person cuz you know they get those things in their mind and they get all of this and that and the other but that's what I said a moment ago instead of taking the word and settling down and trying to preach the word to the people Sunday after Sunday week after week year after year they just run with this and run with that they got a whole lot more following you know because everybody wants little things you know to to do something you know they want to to do it's like how if I have probably told that girl I said yep world's going to end tomorrow you better be in church tonight over here with us you know well she might have come but I didn't intend to encourage her or discourage her but now listen let's get off that I'm trying to talk about something present tense all right let's go to um but while you're there have you ever now we read let me let me say this I'm trying to do present day we read Thessalonians right all right we read that scripture and we read it we're called up to meet the Comfort one another with these words but have you ever read the fifth chapter let's just keep reading that to 5th chapter verse one but of the times and the seasons brother you you have no need that I write unto you other words he trying to get it out of their mind it's going to take place back there right for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety isn't that around the world today oh everything's okay yeah then sudden destruction cometh upon them travail upon them as travail upon a woman with child they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in darkness and listen that that day should overtake you as a thief right you're supposed to be programmed you know in the gospel right right you're Children Of Darkness oh I didn't read that right did I children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness therefore let us not sleep as others do but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for all for and helmet the hope of salvation [Music] see we read the fourth chapter but we don't read on down that he's telling us it's not going to be here it's going to be in the end time see we're in the end time you you we everbody everybody said that until of course you go up there people you know you know what I mean you do it you you talk to somebody and they say oh the end of the world's coming like i' said to that girl if i' said to her you know yeah that's right end of the world here yeah it is you know what she' probably say it now nobody knows the day and or the hour see they believe it until you telling them it's coming now they wanted about 40 years down the road that would make me 111 so I don't have to worry about it right everybody wants to put it off but see I'm talking about something now look in first Corinthians that's a scripture we all use First Corinthians 15 if I can get my Bible to cooperate 51 but I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed again Paul is putting it like it's going to be a his time because he's using the phrase We but he he's saying it's not going to be in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality then is brought to P the saying death where you stay grave where you Victory all right now that has not taken place right right right amen now see even if the dead appeared Among Us right now we've not all changed so there's things pointing to specific dates and times that will be dates and times then we're not supposed to be worried about it but it will be a certain date or time it we just don't we're just not concerned see because we're not concerned with dates and things but we're concerned with the scriptures being fulfilled right see that scripture is speaking to you and I that that's for us right we got to fulfill this scripture all right and if we don't fulfill this scripture see the dead can't raage right right that's right man if we don't fulfill the the scriptures of Thessalonians coming over with a shout and the voice this scripture can't be made manifest that's right and even if we fulfill do you understand what I'm saying if we fulfill Thessalonians and realize the shout and and the dead would raise we still got to be we would still have a frame of time dealing with to the point that we wouldn't be changed because the dead in Christ should rise and then will be changed right see that's why you say to me brother there when you you think the end of the world's coming no it can't come for 3 and 1/2 years you sure yeah why because it's 3 and 1/2 years after the Rapture and we're still here right well we not not be going well you go ahead and doubt all you want to you know cuz I believe I know what it is you know the change in the things all right and and and that's what I'm just saying see so it don't bother me predictions the girl she said when I first heard that I just scared well you know where you at you're not scared I ain't worried about it see all right but now get to Point see scriptures pointing to where we're at now we're back into Romans 8 right to see what the world is waiting for are right to see what is related to all of these Chang in a moment twinkle and eye Lord descending from heaven with a shout voice of Archangel trumpet Etc all of that is dependent upon somebody and recognizing who they are right right right because that's what Paul said Paul said here in Romans what verse 19 18 19 for Discerning expectation of the creature or the whole Creation in other world waiteth for what the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity in other words he would put down under all of this problem not willingly not of his own in other words but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God one of these days all of this is going to be changed right right right for we know that the whole creation groan and tril Us in pain together until now groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God so what is the what is dependent what is it all dependent upon see a fulfillment of scripture right it's dependent upon you and I amen all we believe that we are the children of God don't we that's right we believe we're the Sons and Daughters of the Living God well then the whole world is waiting on you and I to recognize who we are and to step out on it and and quit playing around you know we were talking about this last night then it the my brother Tom was laying there and and I remember somebody said well you know he ain't saying nothing but he's listening and he's saying come on you know come on cuz we talking about what he love to talk about you they around brother Tom very long you're going to hear something about Daniel 70 weeks or the seals or something right we may have not agreed with his approach to go out to the world and just grab somebody in a a waffle house and set them down and buy them a dinner and talk to them for as long as they'll sit there about the seals we might not agreed with that but there's one thing about it what was we doing oh we're so spiritual we don't do it like that where was we at oh changes things don't not turn off you know I tried to tell him I said brother Tom you can't tell the world about these things but you know what what there's one sitting right back there right that'll tell you that while he was holding that thing over him and and all and he was doing weightlifting and brother Gary made the wrong mistake while he was doing the weightlifting with the big bars he said you know any place to go to church he couldn't move cuz all he had to do was drop the weights and he did he dropped the weight of where to go right well all right so that's the point but now do you see what I'm talking about I mean my point is that there's scripture for you and I right to fulfill there are still scriptures to be fulfilled now when we get out of here God is going to Israel right you know that that scripture that's not fulfilled right amen so when he goes to Israel and they receive the Gospel they can say this is present tense truth to us right agree but see when are we going to realize that this message is Made Alive in you and I in this present tense right the truth this day this scripture is fulfilled don't you believe we're in the end of the time don't you believe that we've already in the process of the Lord himself descending from heaven with a sh the message Mage right amen don't you believe those things amen all right then the dead is waiting on you and I right how about Hebrews 11:40 they without us all those Warriors of Faith the dead raised the sick healed uh Lions killed Giants killed all kind of the whole Hebrews 11 and he assed up by saying they without us cannot be made perfect right well see then the Bible's right they're groaning right waiting on you and I waiting on you and I right that's hard to think about it and then we let the devil be a good little buddy with us you know talk us out of even thinking it's for us oh yeah it's for yeah I agree now I believe that Bible right but you're just not the person well hang around I'm talking to him hang around because you told the Lord Jesus that he wasn't that person yeah one day proved it right and you can't argue with him no more you know it I'm talking to Satan he can't argue because he knows what he done brother Brown said he believes him to be Hebrews 13:8 a whole lot more than you and I do right all right but now they without us cannot come to a completion see we spend a lot of time and that's that's all right I do too now I've done it too we're talking about the word perfect and what it means and how it doesn't mean what we used to think it mean all that that's that's fine but do we go on to say that they can't be complete without us do we see the key that without us they can't be made complete we don't talk about the us see we only talk about the things of how something is perfect right or what it means but they without us cannot be made perfect right what about what your Prophet had to say right so we must depend upon what he would be saying I gave you some quotes where we talking about the word for each age you got those like Christ identified the same 1964 4 4:15 he's talking about the word for the age when that word is ready to be manifested now what he said you take my word when the word is ready to be manifested God sends down a prophet to reveal the word all right we believe God sent a prophet to reveal the word now he said one day that that Prophet would be pointing to the skies to a word born bride that's what he's going to be pointing in he was pointing those things to you and I but do you believe what he's saying read all them I gave you the word for each age we talk about IM morphe that's why we're not Oneness because one this believe Jesus was the last and morphe of God all right now but we believe the bride is the last IM morphe of the Gentile dispensation then he goes to Israel and they'll be the last IM morphe you know but we believe the truth so I gave you a quote there who this mzd 1965 221 says what a glorious saying God in morphe mask in a pillar of fire god in morphe in a man called Jesus God in morphe in his church God above us God With Us God in us the condescending of of God and he goes on down and it's the last part of that he says that was God above us God With Us now it's God in us the Holy Spirit not the third person the same person right and what does that do then look at God's only provided place of worship 1965 11:28 the morning service paragraph 264 he says no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you now there's a good old devil yeah but we go got Liv so it'll never happen if God promis it it will forget about the rest of it right right all right he said it couldn't happen in Luther's age why ca us to be fulfilled in this age right couldn't happen in Wesley's days wouldn't do it in the Pentecostal age but in the day when the son of man will be manifested revealed brought back the church together now listen to him the church together with the entire deity of God amongst his people showing the same visible signs and manifestation that he did at the beginning do you believe iten Christ mystery of God reveal 6 1963 728 page 56 and in there there'd be a Time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminence in this church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by why accepting what Eve turned down and Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit in life message called pardoned preached in 1963 tuon Arizona 10:28 he's talking about eternal life and the Holy Spirit resting within you and bringing forth the life he said God is waiting the hour to see his church come to that position regardless of denomination regardless of creed color whatever it may be that his entire church would come to the place that they're displaying the token of the death of Jesus Christ Christ is the Myster of God revealed 1963 7:28 page 25 God expressed in Jesus Christ who was both Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily now the complete fullness of the godhead had bodily dwells in his church the preeminence all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was is poured into the church the believer not the denomination he said we'll get to that in finish and show you we have seen his star 1963 126 when Christ Jesus was being formed now listen because when brother R said he said when the bride be to say I and my father are one and the other things he said them denominations will swing together right so now watch him as reason I gave you this when Christ Jesus was being formed in Mary that's when the persecution set in that's right so I thought that's what it want to be formed in you and I that's when her persecution started and it's the same thing in you Galatians 1 or Galatians 4:19 says that when Christ the hope of glory formed formed in you Christ is being formed in you when you are dying and Christ is coming to life watch the persecutions that end watch trouble start on every hand watch The Devil go on a rampage certainly when Christ is being formed in you mighty God unveil 1964 629 then it was God in them days it was God in man his son Jesus Christ we believe that not just a prophet not just an ordinary man ordinary human it was God in Christ God in a man the fullness of the godhead bodily in a man God in man now it's God in men see the fullness of God in the godhead bodily in his entire church manifesting himself fulfilling his word that's right okay when are we going to believe it I like this one and I just picked it out we have seen his star 19631 12:16 he's talking about the baby's form for a long time along in the womb but this is coming to the coming the last days when the completeness when the fullness of the godhead when the fullness of Christ is to be manifested among his people he said so he promised it in his word you believe it do you believe it the bride becomes the fullness of the godhead Bly he said God is not complete without you right a scripture a time a day an hour mhm for you and I to believe who we are amen we talk about adoption but everybody wants to look it well where's the signs and wonders well open your eyes wake up and believe amen but the greatest sign and wonder is for the word of God to be open because Satan can impersonate all of the gifts and the signs and wonders right right brother around said he can pass out Supernatural gift that's right amen see we always thought God was the only one to do it he said Satan could that's right but said he can't be the word he said he can't be the word he said I wish I could do like some of these other brothers he told one of them you know I forgot who it was might have been thean but I'm not certain he said just go set Down Under that old oak tree brother BOS and he said he has really done it he said cuz he goes out and said he just stands right there with a word and he said he just lays it down and said Satan can't argue with the word right but see it's when we believe right all right now Jesus went through a lot of things right but then one day he sat down he read a scripture and he said am he said this day this scripture is fulfilled right right amen you I believe we're in a day when we can say this day a lot of these scriptures that we've spoken of have been fulfilled absolutely amen and we're in the process of more being fulfilled don't worry about exhausting the word it can't be done just get into it study it pray and believe because as I said to start with and what I did there Sunday afternoon the word manifest is to make known that's right what do you think we're talking about you make him known he will come with signs and wonders and make you known brother brandom made God known you agree it's why he would not allow he used to allow people to preach and he would come behind them and just pray for the sick but he stopped doing it right see because it had to be a message he couldn't trust nobody body else to bring it so he preached his own message right and then the signs and wonders took place see when we preach Jesus Christ in the truth of it you don't have to worry about it he'll make you manifest and whatever what other manifestation would you want then to be able to to stay to stand and say I've tried to make my father known got internet while ago man he's talking about said you really appreciate the godhead series and he come down through and he said really helped me and he said like this he said and when I heard that River Jordan he said my heart just didn't agree with it that's yep that's wonderful amen you know it's just one person if all brother Tom has is Brother Gary on the other side if that's all he has to present to Christ amen he still has a wonderful you know a wonderful presentation to give to the Lord Jesus Christ amen if all we have is one person on the internet that hear he it and it catch the truth and believes it it's worth it see I'm just trying to make my father known I love to talk about my father and making my father known to you is what I desire to do then what he does back in return he doesn't owe me anything right he didn't owe you and I anything in the world we owe him everything name amen that's right brother brandham said if he never heals another person I'll still say he's a healing what do you think about it right scriptures specifically stating about you and me amen find yourself in the Bible and if nothing else at least we gave you you four or five scriptures pertaining exactly to you and I right how much more can you come up with to show where we're at and to make him known I can't heal anybody you can't heal anybody you can't do a miracle I can't do a miracle but we can make our father known right and then we can depend on him cuz he promised it you know I like that let's thing come on I like that don't you he made come on he made the promises let's sing that every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every L I am trusting in his love every promise in the sing it again every promise in the book is M every chapter every verse every L I am trusting in his love every prise in the that's the key of s which means s all right so you know but just think about it singing from the heart and believing every chapter every verse every L I am trusting [Applause] in healing is your Bible said by I am healed every every let me just what he every prise the what man let's turn to 510 thank you Lord for saving
