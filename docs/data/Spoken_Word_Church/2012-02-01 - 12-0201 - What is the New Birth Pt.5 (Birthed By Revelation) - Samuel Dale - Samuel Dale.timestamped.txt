[4:19] say it you know I mean John 3 first John
[4:22] 5.

[5:01] John
[5:03] three
[5:06] there was a man of the Pharisees named
[5:07] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same
[5:10] came to Jesus by night and said unto him
[5:12] Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[5:15] come from God for no man can do these
[5:17] Miracles that thou doest except God be
[5:19] with him
[5:20] Jesus answered and said unto him verily
[5:23] verily I say unto thee except the man be
[5:25] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[5:27] God
[5:28] Nicodemus sent them to him how can a man
[5:30] be born when he is old can he enter the
[5:34] second time into his mother's wound and
[5:36] be born Jesus answered verily verily I
[5:40] say unto thee except a man be born to
[5:42] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[5:45] into
[5:46] the kingdom of God that which is born of
[5:50] the flesh is flesh and that which is
[5:52] born to the spirit is Spirit Marvel not
[5:55] that I said unto thee you must be born
[5:57] again
[5:58] and then we'll go over to first John 5.
[6:04] verse 6 through 8.
[6:06] this is he that came by water and blood
[6:09] even Jesus Christ not by water only but
[6:11] by water and blood it is the spirit that
[6:15] bears witness because the spirit is
[6:17] truth
[6:18] for there are three that by record in
[6:20] heaven the Father the word and the Holy
[6:22] Ghost and these three are one there are
[6:25] three that bear witness in the Earth
[6:27] excuse me in a redo right there are
[6:29] three that by our record in heaven the
[6:31] Father the word and the Holy Ghost and
[6:33] these three are one now watch it and
[6:35] there are three that bear Witness
[6:37] one is a record the other one is a
[6:39] witness one's in heaven other one is
[6:41] here on the Earth all right there are
[6:43] three that bear witness in Earth the
[6:45] spirit and the water and the blood and
[6:48] these things agree in one you may be
[6:51] seated the Lord has blessing to the
[6:53] reading of the word
[6:56] no
[6:57] we've been talking about
[7:01] what is the new birth
[7:04] you know and you can ask most people
[7:06] even ask churches you know what is the
[7:08] new birth and well I'll tell you this
[7:10] and want to tell you it's that and the
[7:12] other tell you the other things and and
[7:14] whatever it is it you will uh have many
[7:17] many different uh answers
[7:21] and so is it with the people of the
[7:23] message or the hour that you ask them
[7:26] and you listen to them and you go to
[7:28] this church and they'll teach it one way
[7:30] and it starts that way and all about one
[7:33] thing which is the new birth but uh you
[7:37] know I want us to think on these things
[7:42] and to be able to see the the the
[7:45] importance of it and then you know see
[7:49] whether or not you have the the new
[7:51] birth all right and we tried to cover
[7:54] their Sunday in a lengthy service in the
[7:56] afternoon I'm sorry but it was a little
[7:58] empty but yet trying to get a point to
[8:01] you to show the uh what would you call
[8:04] it the overlay or whatever of brother
[8:06] Reynolds message and the Bible to show
[8:09] that it verifies that uh your new birth
[8:12] begins
[8:14] when you repent right amen justification
[8:18] repentance and your new birth begins
[8:21] right there all right now that doesn't
[8:23] mean that you you stop if you stop at
[8:26] that point you got a problem amen but
[8:28] then you've got sanctification where
[8:30] that you're going to the cleansing and
[8:32] setting aside of the vessel all right
[8:35] and then you come down to the basis of
[8:37] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the birth
[8:40] all right now
[8:42] that way we want to cover it to keep it
[8:44] in line because like I tried to explain
[8:47] you you run around them is preaching an
[8:50] overall message to uh people and he's
[8:54] trying to explain a lot of things
[8:58] and trying to get his message across and
[9:01] he said I've always on on the future
[9:04] home there two times he said right I've
[9:06] always taught three stages of Grace well
[9:10] I then we have to to stay with that to
[9:13] to uh be able to follow it and I just
[9:17] wrote a couple of these off and we don't
[9:19] have them now for the for the viewing
[9:21] there but on uh paragraph 113 is the
[9:23] sign of the time 63 11 13.
[9:27] he said it's three stages of Grace but
[9:30] said really extreme stations right you
[9:33] call it stations there all right in the
[9:37] message called hidden live 55 1006 three
[9:40] steps are dispensations
[9:42] now he's calling it a dispensation and
[9:45] he says we are in the last dispensation
[9:49] all right now
[9:52] and then we've got them naturally on
[9:54] paragraph 78 and paragraph 86 of the
[9:56] future home where he said he believed in
[9:58] the three stages in the talk that from
[10:00] the beginning all right but now when
[10:02] he'll say that you are born again
[10:06] and talking about justification
[10:10] remember that you have to cover that
[10:12] that way because how else could you
[10:14] cover it because if he didn't say it
[10:16] that way it would leave out Wesley
[10:19] Luther and all of them down through
[10:20] there so he has to bring it in the order
[10:23] to try to cover it all right but we
[10:26] believe in this day that we have to have
[10:28] this three stages because that's like
[10:30] the outer Court the inner Court the holy
[10:32] of holies the water the blood the life
[10:35] you know which is the the natural things
[10:37] coming forth and doing that and uh now I
[10:43] stirred some thoughts Sunday afternoon
[10:45] there and I hope to keep stirring them
[10:48] to get you to think amen because I want
[10:51] to tell you the truth
[10:53] you know but you know I tried to express
[10:56] to you uh a little bit about the new
[10:58] birth and and uh you know
[11:02] a lot of people think the new birth is
[11:04] just they'll come to the Altar and and
[11:06] they just pray through right now that's
[11:08] wonderful I believe in that I gave you
[11:11] scripture to show you that the three
[11:14] thousand
[11:15] you know that received the baptism of
[11:17] the Holy Ghost on the debt Pentecost
[11:19] now the 3 000 outside they went through
[11:22] the three stages right there right back
[11:25] but it took the disciples three and a
[11:27] half years to be tutored
[11:30] you know because there was no uh Holy
[11:34] Ghost been given until it was in Jesus
[11:37] Christ all right right but it took them
[11:39] that time and and I told you that I
[11:42] believe that you know and I tell you now
[11:45] listen this is what I'm saying now you
[11:47] say well brother Dave when you say this
[11:49] one now I'm saying what I mean I believe
[11:51] you can come to the Altar and pray right
[11:53] through to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[11:55] that's right all right because it's
[11:57] according to your faith amen according
[11:58] to what you can believe right all right
[12:01] but I believe too that most people will
[12:05] not do it right little takes time it
[12:08] takes that's right the doings but still
[12:10] no matter what now
[12:13] you've got to go through today three
[12:16] stages or steps our dispensations or
[12:19] stations or whatever you want to call it
[12:22] to be warned again amen yeah all right
[12:25] because we're in the climax of it all to
[12:27] tie everything together all right so
[12:30] then you've got to have those three and
[12:31] I believe and did experience my own self
[12:35] so that's the one reason I believe it
[12:37] but I believe it's that each step of the
[12:41] new birth is is a station or a place or
[12:44] a dispensation or a Time
[12:46] and uh you know it's something you're
[12:49] going through
[12:50] all right
[12:52] a birth means coming forth in too right
[12:55] right all right now then in doing that
[12:58] then sometimes it takes time I refer to
[13:02] Brother Gary Atkins and we talked a
[13:04] little bit about it because he was about
[13:05] one year in his experience of of seeking
[13:10] after God and now you've heard me tell
[13:11] this thousands of times that that I was
[13:14] two years when I came into this message
[13:16] I was a uh you know I had received what
[13:20] I thought was salvation when I was it of
[13:23] them when I was about 18 years old and I
[13:27] believe it was a work of God and I
[13:29] believe God cleansed me up and took away
[13:31] a lot of the desires I had and things
[13:34] like that but when I saw what the
[13:36] prophet was saying about the baptism of
[13:38] the Holy Ghost I realized I didn't have
[13:41] it right and for two years now I studied
[13:44] the message and you've heard me even
[13:46] tell I was reading six books a day and
[13:48] listening to two tapes you know in one
[13:51] day
[13:51] and it that was not just one day of
[13:54] doing I would do it all the time brother
[13:55] colic and witness to that because he was
[13:57] sitting right there with me I sat down
[13:59] in an old chair right in his place where
[14:02] he worked and we talked for hours and
[14:05] I'd read for hours you know and do it
[14:08] but I was still seeking God
[14:10] until one day I received an experience
[14:13] that I felt agreed with what the Bible
[14:17] and what the prophet had been trying to
[14:19] describe as the experience of the
[14:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen now
[14:23] speaking in tongues is not the baptism
[14:26] is not the baptism of all this right
[14:29] amen we read where the Prophet said a
[14:31] lot of people shouted and I put it back
[14:33] in here tonight A lot of people shouted
[14:35] and didn't get the Holy Ghost a lot of
[14:36] people believed and didn't get to hold
[14:38] up a lot of people spoke in tongues and
[14:40] didn't get it all right so then there's
[14:43] a difference and now here's one I want
[14:45] you to think about
[14:47] you know I gave it to brother Joe and
[14:50] them to pull up
[14:51] and sometimes when I do that you look
[14:53] outside you'll see ones and then on the
[14:55] other side you'll see one a so go ahead
[14:57] and put up 1A this is one thing that
[14:59] comes up when I'm sitting in that study
[15:01] and something clicks and I I said well I
[15:03] better get that one all right so now
[15:06] look what he said on page 148 of the
[15:09] show Martin Church age which is the
[15:11] church age book all right
[15:14] look what he's talking about let's stop
[15:16] up here in the beginning
[15:18] he's talking about how they had to
[15:20] journey and they all came through the
[15:21] same Mammon and eight of the same manner
[15:24] and would start with a spitting Rock and
[15:26] fought her the same Cloud by day and the
[15:28] pillar Fire by night but only two
[15:30] reached the promised land that's right
[15:32] only two were true are real Believers
[15:35] that is correct because the word tells
[15:38] us that the rest died because of
[15:40] unbelief and because of unbelief they
[15:43] could not enter in Hebrews 3 19. then
[15:47] since that is so and only two entered
[15:49] then the rest were not true believers
[15:51] what made the difference what's that who
[15:56] stayed with the word right when the
[15:58] hearts of the ten spies failed at
[16:00] Katie's barnia Joshua and Caleb did not
[16:03] stack did not excuse did not stagger for
[16:07] they believed the word and said we are
[16:10] more than able to take the land they
[16:12] knew they could because God had said it
[16:15] that's it I have give you the land I
[16:18] after all those Israelites
[16:22] what saw the power the goodness the
[16:25] Deliverance of God they did not enter
[16:27] into rest which is the top of the Holy
[16:31] Ghost so you can see right now that very
[16:36] few will ever believe all the way to
[16:39] receiving the spirit of God Amen
[16:42] and very few people will believe all the
[16:44] way to receive in the spirit of God they
[16:47] may be religious they may go to church
[16:49] they may shout speak in tongues all kind
[16:51] of thing claim the message of the hour
[16:53] all kind of things run around and said
[16:56] that they'll they'll they will be in you
[16:59] know claim to to stay with the old
[17:01] message or something you know and try to
[17:02] claim the new birth of the age that
[17:04] we're living in and you look around and
[17:06] when we get down to getting into those
[17:08] doctrines and I said I wouldn't get to
[17:09] it's been kind of slow but you know
[17:12] taking some of the doctrines of the
[17:13] message you'll find out that a lot of
[17:15] those doctrines were old doctrines right
[17:19] way back
[17:20] brother Brown said every Doctrine come
[17:22] out of Genesis right amen then you'll
[17:26] see that a lot of those doctrines will
[17:28] go back to the Mormons go back to the
[17:30] bad disc go back to the methodists the
[17:32] you know the things that that will show
[17:36] you that that message is where it came
[17:37] from right all right we'll see people
[17:39] claiming to be this great Revelation you
[17:41] know that's come forth in the end times
[17:43] since the prophet brought it but he said
[17:46] he taught three processes three stages
[17:48] from the beginning all right
[17:51] justification sanctification amen the
[17:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right
[17:55] man that is what constitutes as we gave
[17:58] them their Sunday the new birth that's
[18:00] right all right and doing that then
[18:03] I want you to follow it or to listen to
[18:06] what I'm saying
[18:09] I believe then that very few people
[18:13] see he said very few people would really
[18:15] want to receive him right I believe very
[18:17] few people can believe under receiving
[18:19] when they come to the altar right the
[18:21] first time yes sir he said well I went
[18:24] down and shut the hand to the preacher I
[18:25] went down that smoking tongue and I
[18:27] cried I shouted oh that's well and good
[18:29] yeah
[18:31] if it was the new birth
[18:34] amen but if not it was a work of the
[18:38] holy spirit because justification isn't
[18:40] working on this right sanctification is
[18:42] a work of the Holy Spirit but the
[18:44] baptism is not right see justification
[18:47] doesn't put the life of God in you
[18:50] sanctification cleanses The Vessel for
[18:53] the life of God to be placed but the
[18:56] baptism has to burn out according to
[18:57] Future home all the things that are left
[19:00] and can place the life of God within you
[19:03] to be the new birth all right now in
[19:06] doing that then
[19:08] I want you to follow with me and think
[19:10] about it
[19:12] that
[19:13] however it is if you go to the Altar and
[19:16] receive it one time wonderful get me
[19:18] right that's right don't go off and say
[19:20] brother Dale ain't saying the truth
[19:22] now you're lying if you do
[19:25] I'm telling you the best I can to give
[19:27] you scripture for it the prophet talks
[19:28] about things some people receive and
[19:31] pray through right at one time right
[19:34] amen but mainly but basically most
[19:37] people don't that's right
[19:39] that's her
[19:41] then they have to go through the stages
[19:42] but if you go through it right there at
[19:45] one time that night you went through the
[19:46] three stages to get there or you didn't
[19:49] get it right right you didn't get the
[19:50] new birth if you didn't go through three
[19:52] stages that's right well all I've done
[19:54] is just come up shouting and screaming
[19:56] well if you didn't and it was because
[19:58] you went through the three stages right
[20:01] but if you only went into stage one you
[20:03] can shout like everything stage two you
[20:06] can really shout all over the place yeah
[20:08] and thank you got it and that's the
[20:10] danger of the point to people is they
[20:14] won't go on and seek God after them
[20:16] right all right here's 18 492 times I
[20:20] said this
[20:21] I'd rather seek God all my life
[20:25] yes sir and get at the end of The
[20:28] Journey he said you've had it all alone
[20:30] amen then to go through all of my
[20:32] journey not seeking God
[20:35] and wind up at the end of it and he said
[20:37] depart from me I never knew you right
[20:38] right
[20:40] yeah I want to go on with God and keep
[20:42] on seeking God and I you know I I like
[20:45] what brother Brown said he says I knew
[20:47] the Rapture was coming tomorrow right
[20:49] and he said I plant potatoes he said I
[20:51] just go plant potatoes
[20:55] that's what he said all right
[20:58] you said well bless God I know people in
[21:01] this message because of 77 now they sold
[21:04] out quit and barred everything they
[21:06] could ready to live and
[21:08] yep
[21:10] 1977 packs they wound up broke right in
[21:13] financial stress and everything else and
[21:15] then they had to live off a lot of other
[21:16] people probably yep
[21:19] but see it's because of what the dog all
[21:21] right
[21:22] he calls you what did this talk yep
[21:25] amen then for him and help but I don't
[21:28] believe we've taught it that way right
[21:30] all right now do you understand what I'm
[21:33] saying now
[21:36] I believe you can go all the way through
[21:38] it one time
[21:40] I believe that because they did in the
[21:43] Bible
[21:44] that's right but I know all the polishes
[21:46] and all of those different things they
[21:47] were in a journey right right amen and
[21:51] even let's see now if I can get this
[21:52] right and if I quote the names wrong
[21:54] places correctly you do it wasn't
[21:57] um
[21:58] two of the disciples was even preaching
[22:00] the gospel to a group and couldn't get
[22:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost to come on
[22:04] to people that are in the book of Acts
[22:05] and they had to go get somebody one got
[22:07] John or one color or who other Peter or
[22:10] whoever it was to come down and lay
[22:12] hands on them they received the Holy
[22:13] Ghost
[22:15] but see everybody thinks she just you
[22:17] know what do you mean I shouted so I
[22:19] know I got it well all right we're gonna
[22:21] find out after a while what the evidence
[22:24] is amen
[22:26] and see if that evidence will come will
[22:28] you know if if it will do it
[22:31] you know it doesn't matter what we do we
[22:33] shout speak in tongue you could now
[22:35] forgive me for taking it but you could
[22:37] take the life of brother Brown and the
[22:38] ministry he had
[22:42] and bring it down to the bases and put
[22:44] it in an individual and if that
[22:46] individual wasn't born again he still
[22:48] lost right all right amen
[22:51] that's as firm as I believe
[22:54] he said no cause you can't do this you
[22:56] can't do that people have done it
[22:58] right
[22:59] thank you
[23:01] they've done it and wound up still lost
[23:03] right
[23:04] yes you know but brother Dale you don't
[23:07] understand I I know I got the Holy Ghost
[23:09] because I believe the message
[23:12] um
[23:13] brother used to tell me he said I know
[23:15] I'm going to heaven because I love right
[23:16] around the family
[23:18] well that's wonderful
[23:20] but that was the only evidence he had
[23:22] now I'm going to turn down that evidence
[23:24] I never told him he was lost brother
[23:27] left here you know one time because he
[23:30] told me about something I said well if
[23:31] this don't match up he said you told me
[23:33] I was wrong
[23:36] I told him what he was saying didn't
[23:38] match the word right well if he's
[23:41] standing here right now telling the same
[23:43] thing in right
[23:45] because that's you know if our lives
[23:47] don't line up that's it amen see
[23:50] people's done away with fruit so the
[23:52] spirit as being an Evidence
[23:53] now brother Randall said to the Lord
[23:56] corrected him straightened him out and
[23:57] lined up right I agree we'll read them
[23:59] but you showed me where he ever done
[24:01] away with fruits this year
[24:04] sorry
[24:09] no
[24:13] but if you do all the other and then got
[24:15] the fruits and Spirits you're getting
[24:16] lined up good amen that's right but if
[24:18] you just got the fruits of the spirits
[24:20] you're not lined up too good because the
[24:21] condo priest can have it that's right
[24:24] but the condo priest cannot receive the
[24:27] word so we're going to get to that all
[24:29] right but we're going to take it easy
[24:30] get into there if we don't get there
[24:31] I'll get it clear all right do we want
[24:34] to explaining
[24:36] are trying to explain
[24:38] of the fact that
[24:40] in the days of Luther to just believe
[24:45] that was the new birth of his age that's
[24:47] right amen now he was already we would
[24:51] call him a convert
[24:53] he was a what do you call them a a
[24:56] what's the word for it's not monk is it
[24:59] what's the word he was in the monastery
[25:00] he was going to he was studying you know
[25:03] of the cat he was in the Catholic church
[25:05] and he was studying the the message you
[25:08] know of what they thought and and all
[25:10] I've had a great high ranking monk a
[25:12] great high-ranking man right sure huh
[25:16] but one day the Lord spoke to him see it
[25:18] was time right that might have been okay
[25:21] in the days behind but something
[25:23] happened and Martin Luther said the
[25:26] judge shall live by faith and he wrote
[25:28] alone on his Bible from what they said
[25:32] you know and I wrote it on mine because
[25:34] she'll live by faith alone right right
[25:36] all right but see that was the message
[25:38] then it was required right that those
[25:42] who came in contact with Luther to have
[25:45] the new birth of the age was no longer
[25:48] to stay with the catholicisms right that
[25:51] they were dealing with a Salvation the
[25:54] Penance is the the uh you know the the
[25:57] offerings the things and you remember
[25:59] Martin Luther was just about to die from
[26:02] fasting and crawling up on beds and and
[26:05] laying on on needles and all kind of
[26:08] different things and just tormenting
[26:09] itself to try to appease his soul
[26:13] but he couldn't do it
[26:15] so then he wound up with de facto
[26:18] the just your little Buffet amen
[26:20] well now did that stop Martin Luther
[26:23] from living a good
[26:30] and you say it that way he probably
[26:31] afterward fasted more
[26:34] he probably cried out for the sins of
[26:36] the people and himself more after then
[26:38] than he ever had before
[26:42] right but he got the new birth
[26:45] that's right he got the new birth
[26:47] because the birth is the birth of the
[26:49] word amen now that's what I believe so
[26:51] I've taught it to you from the beginning
[26:53] right I believe the new birth is the
[26:55] birth of the word amen I didn't say the
[26:57] new birth is to read the word or didn't
[27:00] say I believe the word it's when the
[27:02] word is revealed to the equipment to you
[27:05] it's made alive to you that's the new
[27:08] birth Jesus sewed the word down for
[27:11] three and a half years into those
[27:13] disciples heart
[27:14] and when the Holy Ghost fell on the day
[27:16] of Pentecost it quickened that word that
[27:19] they had held according to the Bible
[27:21] amen they took the word and held it and
[27:23] they equipped it or made it alive that
[27:25] was the New Birth so it'd be the new
[27:27] birth in every age would be the birth of
[27:29] the word right
[27:32] and that's where brother round said
[27:33] people will even deny the birth of the
[27:35] word
[27:36] I put it somewhere in my nose they got
[27:38] sticking somewhere yeah okay
[27:43] listen to what he calls the the birth of
[27:46] the false prophets will bring false
[27:48] birth it's not on the computer now
[27:50] true profits will bring the word right
[27:53] the birth of the word Christ
[27:56] amen all right that's my message called
[27:59] you must be born again 62 12 31 in the
[28:01] morning service all right 62 318 the
[28:05] spoken word is the original seat
[28:07] now for the birth of the word is Christ
[28:10] not a polluted with the denominations
[28:12] the early church no denominations just a
[28:15] word and spirit irrigated brother God
[28:17] laid the word down there like that and
[28:19] the Holy Spirit irrigated and there she
[28:21] went she brought four children amen huh
[28:26] he says on the message the seed is not
[28:28] air with a shot 65 2 18 referring to
[28:32] Mary when the Mary denied
[28:36] you know and said
[28:38] your father and I right all right what
[28:40] did she deny Pentecost took speaking in
[28:43] tongues they denied the birth of the
[28:45] word that's exactly what it did it'll
[28:47] take so much of it but they won't take
[28:49] the rest of it it denied the birth of
[28:51] the word just like Mary did
[28:53] so you can watch there's no more
[28:55] organizations you know all right so then
[28:58] deny the birth of the word
[29:02] you said what brother Dale I I just
[29:04] received no you've got to have somebody
[29:05] there's never been anybody to received a
[29:07] new birth that didn't hear the word show
[29:09] me one time yes sir I challenge that up
[29:12] on the Basin and they were in the Bible
[29:13] or the prophet's message or anywhere he
[29:16] said well I wouldn't I wouldn't hear no
[29:18] preacher I'd read oh you're reading
[29:22] I was listening to tell you oh yes
[29:24] listen take you listen to somebody right
[29:27] amen because the seed has to come
[29:30] through the body right
[29:33] come on
[29:35] was he into that then look what the
[29:37] prophet goes on to say okay brother pull
[29:39] up
[29:40] um
[29:42] number one
[29:44] this is the message how can I overcome
[29:46] 1963 8 25 in the morning service
[29:49] and look what he says this is the age of
[29:51] the life personal life of Christ where
[29:54] the the chemicals of his body
[29:57] chemical out his body
[29:59] what was in him first under
[30:02] justification now remember the other
[30:03] Sunday I showed where the Run said the
[30:06] things that was in the body of Christ of
[30:08] Jesus Christ came out was the ability to
[30:11] bring the New Birth the water the blood
[30:13] the life right right remember that tie
[30:16] it together now huh what was in here
[30:18] first under justification about
[30:20] justification the water baptism second
[30:22] under the new birth
[30:24] of Wesley sanctification with cleansers
[30:27] and thirdly under the baptism when the
[30:29] Holy Ghost putting the vessel in the
[30:30] door so he calls Wesley's message in his
[30:33] birth the sanctification was a birth and
[30:36] like I told you the other day we
[30:38] actually come along believing Martin
[30:39] Luther's message came to America to
[30:41] preach to the heater found out he needed
[30:44] to be converted himself
[30:46] why because God was moving into another
[30:49] realm to bring sanctification all right
[30:52] so then in that age then if you said I
[30:55] believe Luther
[30:56] well how come you don't believe what we
[30:58] actually talk all right
[31:00] yep and we're not talking about the
[31:01] wrong thing
[31:03] talking about the truth right right so
[31:06] is it when Azusa Street came with the
[31:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother
[31:10] Brown calls that a great prophet 464 the
[31:12] seal book right amen a great prophet
[31:15] came
[31:16] you said no that's no no read the book
[31:19] then at the end of the day so messenger
[31:21] would arrive
[31:22] the Holy Ghost is the prophet of God
[31:25] Amen I remember when it was up at
[31:27] Jeffersonville you know years ago
[31:29] started about 68 going there and they'd
[31:32] say who's to take over who's the leaders
[31:34] who's who's the prophet now well Bill
[31:36] Paul got it one day he said I want to
[31:37] read you something I'm going to run and
[31:39] said right here the baptism of the Holy
[31:41] Ghost is the prophet right
[31:44] glad he done that so yeah all right man
[31:46] watch we've been over these but I want
[31:48] to keep reminding you look at number
[31:50] twos questions and answers on the seal
[31:52] 63 324 in the morning service
[31:55] you see each one of those ages only
[31:57] taking the dip into the Holy Spirit
[31:59] justification of the work of the Holy
[32:01] Spirit sanctification is the work of the
[32:02] Holy Spirit
[32:03] but the baptism is the holy spirit look
[32:06] at it that's the reason it took a
[32:08] prophetic Prophet to come down
[32:11] that's the reason why they say about it
[32:14] no matching girl to the age
[32:18] who was that in Sister Street
[32:20] because the Holy Ghost came himself in
[32:22] his fullness of the baptism then at the
[32:25] end of the age is when the prophet came
[32:26] on the scene amen the baptism of the
[32:28] Holy Ghost that came forth on the day of
[32:30] zeuser street was the baptism of the
[32:32] Holy Ghost just exactly like the 3 000
[32:35] in the book of Acts amen not like the
[32:37] 120 in the upper room I've explained
[32:39] that they were two or three and a half
[32:41] years the other only heard one message
[32:43] and receive the new birth all right
[32:47] that's your word we putting it all in
[32:50] you look at the next one the third seal
[32:52] which in 1963 320th
[32:57] but then if the Pentecostal message was
[32:59] the last message which just to became
[33:00] the same question the baptism of the
[33:02] Holy Ghost the live stream messages the
[33:04] last three Church ages forms the
[33:07] complete birth
[33:09] right then he goes on to explain read it
[33:11] off there while I'm talking he's
[33:13] explaining that what comes from Jesus's
[33:15] body right is the very substance that
[33:18] brings us to a new birth
[33:21] water bud
[33:23] Spirit life right right all right so now
[33:27] where is it going to
[33:29] see then we firmly believe in
[33:32] each age having the baptism of the Holy
[33:36] Ghost
[33:37] all down truth all seven Church ages
[33:41] and each one of those were born into the
[33:43] kingdom of God
[33:46] all right and then it's to return and it
[33:49] was to return back in the day of Azusa
[33:52] Street and I'm running a long line
[33:54] across all right but to come to where
[33:57] did it requires three stages or three
[33:59] steps of Grace to be in the body
[34:02] see it's returned back like it was in
[34:04] the book of Acts
[34:07] all right Azusa Street brought it back
[34:10] like it was in the book of Acts you said
[34:11] well brother death I don't like that
[34:13] because the Central Street was yeah they
[34:15] were trinitarian that's exactly right
[34:17] right most people don't even know that
[34:20] the one this doctor never started about
[34:22] 1912 or 14 somewhere in there
[34:25] they were trinitarian but that don't
[34:27] make no difference God winked in her
[34:29] ignorance
[34:31] and he calls it the prophet right
[34:33] you know what he said there was no
[34:35] information here to the age then he'll
[34:37] tell you that there was a one-eyed black
[34:39] man was the messenger of that age
[34:42] amen yeah
[34:44] but it's reasons for those things we've
[34:46] been over that and all we're doing
[34:48] all right
[34:50] the New Birth has always been
[34:54] the birth of the word amen
[34:59] now we we get into today when you got
[35:02] artificial inseminations or what you
[35:05] call that you know whatever artificial
[35:07] pragnation but that don't have nothing
[35:10] to do with the word of God right ever
[35:12] birth is the same
[35:15] it doesn't matter if they take it out of
[35:17] this woman take it off that or that man
[35:19] and put it in another woman and she
[35:20] gives birth that don't make no
[35:22] difference it's all still the same
[35:24] he took the life from the man the the
[35:27] egg from the woman and it produces a
[35:29] birth but no matter what they do or
[35:33] whatever you say about it it comes out
[35:34] to be the same every birth is the same
[35:37] amen
[35:39] brother man said where they said a pink
[35:41] dark desperated hospital or you know or
[35:43] where else right
[35:45] it's all the same the same thing happens
[35:48] what water comes forth blood comes forth
[35:54] right
[35:55] and then the baby comes forward amen
[35:59] and just because the baby comes doesn't
[36:01] mean it's alive it's got to have the
[36:03] birth of life or the Breath of Life
[36:05] breathe into its nostrils to become a
[36:08] living Soul right that's what the new
[36:10] birth is the birth of the word where God
[36:13] has breathed into our nostrils
[36:16] I read it to you there where he said it
[36:18] that they they
[36:20] irrigate they lay that word down and God
[36:22] come over there again because that's
[36:25] what it takes to make a bird all right
[36:27] and that would bring forth a complete
[36:29] birth in this day
[36:31] now we go to where brother Brown was
[36:33] talking about what the birth of the word
[36:36] Jesus showed the word
[36:38] the seed for the new birth to come
[36:42] you know brother run said John priest
[36:44] justification Jesus preached Saints
[36:46] vacation all right sure
[36:48] we've been preaching this for 40 years
[36:50] we already know a lot of the glory amen
[36:51] that's right a lot of you heard it for
[36:53] 40 years you ought to know what I'm
[36:54] fixing to say next
[36:57] you said well no don't you
[36:58] sanctification is the sowing of the seed
[37:01] amen that's right man yep he said that's
[37:04] when you're begotten right
[37:06] but then the word was quickened
[37:09] right all right
[37:11] you're coming by The Prophet's message
[37:13] look what he would say then
[37:16] well it was number four
[37:19] you know these but we're just putting
[37:21] them in here a lot of people don't know
[37:23] them from the message Christ The Mystery
[37:24] of God revealed 63 728 look what he said
[37:27] what is the new birth then
[37:32] because you read the other Christ's life
[37:34] in you look Christ in you makes him the
[37:36] center of the life of the Revelation see
[37:38] Christ's life in you makes him the
[37:39] center of the Revelation Christ in the
[37:41] Bible makes the Bible a complete
[37:42] revelation of Christ Christ in you makes
[37:45] you the complete revelation of the whole
[37:46] thing see what God is trying to do what
[37:49] is the new birth then you'd say well
[37:51] brought around what is the new birth
[37:53] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[37:56] personally to you that's right amen
[37:59] see not you join the church you shook a
[38:01] hand you've done something different you
[38:03] said a Creed you promised to live by a
[38:05] code of rules but Christ the Bible he is
[38:09] the word that was revealed to you and no
[38:11] matter what anybody says what takes
[38:13] place listen it's Christ
[38:16] Pastor priests whatever it might be it's
[38:19] Christ in you it's the Revelation that
[38:22] the church was built upon amen
[38:35] that means you you've got a problem and
[38:38] you do something about it right amen
[38:39] right and then you won't wind up at the
[38:41] end of the road saying I've all of my
[38:43] life I've kept this as my evidence
[38:46] and now find out it's not true
[38:49] you remember the woman that rode around
[38:50] and was talking about how she taught
[38:52] Sunday school she's done all kind of
[38:53] things right said but she come to her
[38:55] dying bed
[38:57] she was dying he said her real Soul come
[39:00] up before her right and she said I'm
[39:03] lost
[39:04] yep
[39:06] oh the preacher said you lied to me
[39:10] I'm lost
[39:12] I said get her another hypo in other
[39:14] words shut her up all right
[39:18] because the preacher didn't know how to
[39:20] prayer through right
[39:22] so he surely didn't want to pray for her
[39:23] no more
[39:24] I'm just honest going on
[39:27] see then what is it what is the New
[39:29] Birth the revelation of Jesus Christ
[39:31] personally to you amen
[39:34] amen
[39:36] huh now
[39:39] has he ever revealed himself to you amen
[39:44] that's right or are you just taking what
[39:46] somebody else said that's right that's
[39:48] it right
[39:50] you taking what you've been called yep
[39:54] my brother Dale and I realized that just
[39:56] I sit back I think he want to go
[40:00] you know I was really kind of talking to
[40:02] the devil that
[40:05] you know
[40:06] for over a hundred years who called it
[40:09] producer Street
[40:12] 100 years right right and you know the
[40:15] devil has planted a seed into people's
[40:18] minds it's hard to get that destroyed
[40:20] right man sir because that seed was
[40:23] planted of speaking in tongues shouting
[40:25] crime doing this that or the other
[40:27] until people are dependent upon that and
[40:30] will not depend upon What God Says
[40:33] that's right
[40:35] right
[40:38] so then if for one time tonight after a
[40:41] hundred years
[40:42] I don't mean you've been listening to it
[40:44] but I mean for a hundred years you you
[40:47] and I have faced those things that were
[40:49] brought from a hundred years ago
[40:52] because every one of us in our mind and
[40:54] one way or the other has always wondered
[40:56] what the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[40:57] right right
[41:01] come on you didn't wonder about it right
[41:03] ma'am
[41:05] I don't want to do you I shouted
[41:08] well Gloria Hallelujah I hope you're
[41:10] right
[41:13] I said all I can say right so if you get
[41:15] a mad at me now forgive me
[41:19] not for telling you the truth but
[41:20] forgive me for making you mad at me
[41:24] mad enough you'll get down to study it a
[41:26] little bit
[41:27] you'll dig in
[41:29] and find out whether I'm right or wrong
[41:33] but my daddy says and my mom was this
[41:35] and my uncle's daddy ain't got nothing
[41:37] to do with you
[41:39] right
[41:41] you ain't going to heaven on Daddy's
[41:43] religion or Mama's religion or Uncle's
[41:45] religion or Grandma's religion that's
[41:46] right
[41:48] well you're throwing off on my kin folks
[41:51] no I'm not you are
[41:54] right because you're finally admitting
[41:55] it
[41:57] I mean I love my mother and all heavens
[42:00] done everything I could for her while
[42:02] she was alive
[42:04] but I know my mama could be lost too
[42:08] and that's what a lot of people don't
[42:09] want to realize
[42:11] if my mother wasn't born again she was
[42:13] lost if my daddy wasn't born again she
[42:16] would he was lost
[42:18] I know my mom was that well okay why
[42:23] what's your reason for it
[42:26] come on I don't mean what's your reason
[42:28] for thanking your kin folks are saved
[42:30] yeah
[42:34] yeah I like what the old man used to say
[42:36] when you said old tiny folks said you've
[42:38] got to be born
[42:44] all right
[42:47] I'm sorry
[42:49] with face life amen bro face reality
[42:55] I don't know where brother random was
[42:56] saved or not
[43:00] yeah well I went in him right I only
[43:04] know about myself amen all right
[43:10] folks so you didn't come through like I
[43:11] did when I was sitting there
[43:13] praying and studying and saying Lord
[43:18] with the book in my hand saying
[43:20] this man says they'll be false prophets
[43:25] what if he's one
[43:27] come on brother
[43:29] right that's what I asked the Lord
[43:33] oh bless God I would never do nothing
[43:35] like that brother Dave okay all right
[43:37] you're not gonna eat it forgive me
[43:40] but you know what I got my answer right
[43:42] and that was in the day that I wasn't
[43:44] born again
[43:49] I would ask him I would write the Bible
[43:51] in the books down and say Lord
[43:54] what is this man
[43:56] is a false prophet
[44:00] because he said and you said in your
[44:03] word you see the very left if it was
[44:04] possible and I said I gotta quote your
[44:07] word that he says that matter of fact
[44:09] did get the ride so confusing how to cut
[44:12] to work short I can quote
[44:15] yeah
[44:16] my brother Ryan said that one day
[44:21] you know what do you say
[44:24] how many of you know what I'm fixing to
[44:25] say
[44:27] you heard it thousands of times
[44:30] all he would ever answer me and say what
[44:31] does the word say
[44:34] that's right that's the only answer I'd
[44:36] ever get but you know what that was the
[44:38] right answer right that was the greatest
[44:41] answer I could have ever gotten right
[44:44] he could have come down personally and
[44:46] appeared to me and talk to me and told
[44:48] me all these
[44:52] all these he'd say what does the word
[44:54] say all right man
[44:57] okay I'll go back and read some more
[44:59] then I'll ask you a question again
[45:01] and I got the same answer yep
[45:04] but you see I believe in the birth of
[45:05] the word amen I believe all babies are
[45:08] born because of all babies being birthed
[45:10] exactly a lot you know what amen
[45:12] you know babies born you gotta have a
[45:15] mama you gotta have a daddy but one way
[45:17] or the other where it be what do you
[45:19] call it what's your word building by
[45:20] proxy whatever you want to do it all by
[45:22] you know don't make no difference you
[45:24] still got one
[45:27] but you see what I'm talking about what
[45:29] is the new birth
[45:30] the birth of the word
[45:34] the birth of the word
[45:36] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[45:39] personally to you amen
[45:44] now it's not
[45:47] I won't call her name but
[45:49] she came to the house one time and said
[45:50] I'm going to get baptized because my
[45:52] husband wants me to be I said I won't
[45:54] baptize you know
[45:56] you can forget it
[45:59] so we talked on for a little while and
[46:01] she said that again and I said look
[46:04] I ain't lost you know and all of this
[46:06] stuff I kind of got a little bit of
[46:08] thought coming to me I said you know
[46:11] it's the truth she said yes I said okay
[46:13] we'll do it now
[46:15] we'll go do it now I wouldn't have
[46:17] baptized her it wouldn't make no
[46:18] difference
[46:19] yeah whatever I want to honor I hope
[46:21] you're good that's an honor but
[46:23] you know this is not followed Mom and
[46:25] Daddy
[46:26] now come on folks this is not following
[46:29] Brother Dale right amen if you follow me
[46:32] brother Dale it's like a brother come
[46:33] here years ago said I come to the
[46:35] California to come out here to the Lula
[46:38] thing I said first off that's where you
[46:39] goofed up
[46:41] yep as far as I was concerned he would
[46:43] have stayed in California right a man
[46:46] because he goofed up by thinking there
[46:47] was some Lula thing right
[46:50] right but that's that's all right
[46:53] I don't think there's no rule of that
[46:55] right
[46:56] uh if if this ain't it I want to keep
[46:59] this until that time all right you find
[47:02] it you find that we'll go with that but
[47:05] I'm going to keep this until that comes
[47:07] okay because I I've had a good time you
[47:10] know in all my life and it's always
[47:12] compared
[47:13] and my New Birth has always brought me
[47:16] to that place why now watch what the
[47:18] prophet goes on to say number five that
[47:20] was Vision 1960 1204 in the evening
[47:23] service you've heard this one a long
[47:24] time right now ask God to what we're
[47:27] talking on Revelation ask him to give
[47:28] you a revelation of this for it can only
[47:31] be known by Revelation and you can only
[47:33] be saved by Revelation right yep
[47:37] okay you can only be saved by Revelation
[47:39] you have a knowledge of it
[47:40] intellectually but you can't be saved
[47:43] until it's revealed to you no man can
[47:45] call Jesus the Christ only mother Holy
[47:47] Ghost that's what the Bible says no man
[47:50] can say Jesus is a Christ until he has
[47:52] received the Holy Ghost he might say the
[47:55] pastor says so the Bible says so them
[47:57] are truths the church says no that is
[48:00] true but you don't know yourself until
[48:03] the Holy Ghost has revealed it to you
[48:05] and he's become in you no matter and no
[48:07] man can call Jesus a Christ only by the
[48:09] Holy Ghost not by knowledge not by
[48:11] intellectual amen that's right so it's
[48:15] only can be a personal revelation to you
[48:24] it's not brother Branham brought the
[48:26] message I thank God for the message
[48:28] right but it's the Holy Ghost Amen
[48:31] Brother Richard Wilson said the Bible
[48:33] says
[48:35] what the spirit has to say
[48:37] that's it but the spirit has to say am I
[48:40] think I like that that's right amen the
[48:42] Holy Spirit Well now Brother David A lot
[48:45] of people went off and said the Holy
[48:46] Spirit yep my people would anoint me
[48:48] with the Holy Ghost and when I've done a
[48:49] lot of things too right you come up line
[48:51] like crazy see him God told him there's
[48:53] three Lords two Lords and and two souls
[48:56] and all kind of doctrines oh yeah I
[48:59] don't make no difference that's right
[49:02] I like what Jesus said one day we never
[49:04] said what's after they followed on me
[49:06] right right amen I like that point I
[49:09] ain't trying to get you from me I like
[49:10] what he said all right let's follow him
[49:12] right amen you said you falling right
[49:15] around I believe what Paul
[49:17] Paul said follow me as I follow Christ
[49:19] right
[49:21] you know what I've never found Paul off
[49:23] of fall in Christ and you know after 40
[49:26] something years of studying this message
[49:28] I've never found brother around him off
[49:30] of following Crouch have you right I'll
[49:34] be glad to listen to you if you have oh
[49:36] he said this and he said that yeah what
[49:38] have you said but now listen you can
[49:41] only be saved by Revelation right
[49:44] and it's a revelation of God's word
[49:47] that's right and the prophet we gave you
[49:49] the quote there a minute ago were true
[49:51] prophets will bring true births why
[49:53] because they'll bring you the word
[49:56] the false prophets will bring false
[49:58] birth that's right that's right
[50:00] you ever seen a false birth in the cow
[50:05] only man it really knows what he's
[50:07] talking about can tell you where's
[50:08] Foster true because that old cow she'll
[50:11] start getting fat and she'll start just
[50:13] being mud fat and she'll look like she's
[50:15] as pregnant as everything in the world
[50:17] could be
[50:19] and the man that really knows and walk
[50:21] up and punches aside he said I need
[50:22] number to falzburg
[50:24] and you know what'll happen one day
[50:26] you'll go and out it goes and you ain't
[50:28] got nothing but a skinny old cow
[50:32] because they can push the side to see
[50:33] where the cash is
[50:37] false birth
[50:40] look around the world today and tell me
[50:41] there's not a world full of fox Birds
[50:43] now we're not talking about natural
[50:44] right we're talking about spiritual amen
[50:46] it don't matter where you hun do Muslim
[50:48] whatever it is it's all Salzburg right
[50:51] but it all comes from the same core
[50:56] all right but get on with it
[50:59] each age received the word of the age
[51:01] the Holy Spirit made that Word Alive
[51:03] gave them without AIDS the new birth
[51:07] now let's go to another point then on it
[51:09] for just for tonight
[51:13] what is the evidence of the new birth
[51:20] now
[51:22] if it's right that you've got water
[51:24] blood
[51:26] and life
[51:29] and remember
[51:31] that the baby's not alive in the
[51:33] mother's womb right
[51:34] I'm glad the prophet brought that right
[51:36] no yes it is it's wiggling and twitching
[51:39] yeah they use the souls every animal is
[51:41] in this moment right same thing
[51:45] just twitching and moving right every
[51:48] animal ever burp there's that baby
[51:50] inside of there is twitching and moving
[51:52] that's right you said what they can show
[51:54] you where they're sucking their thumbs
[51:55] and crying and yep and kill the dog
[52:01] right
[52:03] you see what you ain't never seen where
[52:05] they're trying to kill them you know and
[52:07] cause them to
[52:09] lose the baby yeah and then do the same
[52:11] thing with the dog
[52:14] cat whatever
[52:18] because it's not alive right
[52:20] it's alive in the point that it's moving
[52:23] and and blood and Etc disconnected from
[52:27] the mama or the from the the uh
[52:30] umbilical cord and
[52:33] dated right
[52:36] but see water blood baby
[52:40] and in life
[52:42] something to the baby he starts the
[52:44] baby's born doesn't mean that it's alive
[52:48] amen stillborn babies are born every day
[52:51] right
[52:55] so you got a spank you to do something
[52:56] you gotta have something got to happen
[52:58] to it
[52:59] all right
[53:00] but now get the difference in what I'm
[53:02] talking about
[53:03] when we talk about
[53:05] Dan wants to find some way some
[53:07] something something they've done
[53:11] as an Evidence
[53:14] right that's the spanking of the baby
[53:21] see why not get the baby here
[53:24] and a life will prove whether or not
[53:26] it's a baby
[53:29] right amen
[53:31] the life will prove it
[53:34] it'll make many sense that's right
[53:37] because it's
[53:39] it's got a birth
[53:42] all right
[53:43] but now
[53:48] we talk about then
[53:50] fruits of the spirit
[53:52] all right you people say well I I
[53:55] believe I'm saved because I got love joy
[53:57] but he stood this in my heart
[53:59] that's good but your condo appreciate
[54:01] those things too that's right
[54:04] now I believe just like I said while ago
[54:07] I believe in one God
[54:09] always have had I check a doctorate how
[54:12] do you check a doctor brother they'll
[54:13] buy my new birth that's right
[54:18] my new birth is based upon one God
[54:21] right
[54:22] you can't be based upon a trinity
[54:24] because you wouldn't know which one
[54:26] saved you
[54:28] what do you mean I say mother and I said
[54:30] ah come on
[54:33] it's all based upon one God right
[54:37] manifestation of the same God father son
[54:40] Holy Ghost makes one God
[54:42] justification sanitation the baptism of
[54:44] the Holy Ghost makes a new birth water
[54:46] blood and spirit brings the baby a life
[54:49] in the thing
[54:50] out of court intercourse
[54:54] always keep those trees running right
[55:00] big man sit on him throwing that big
[55:01] money sit on my porch one time he said
[55:04] life comes the fourth stage I said life
[55:07] comes the third stage my brother
[55:10] I said I don't know what you're talking
[55:11] about you're reading the prophet's
[55:13] message and got into adoption
[55:15] but you got to have the last year to get
[55:17] something to where you can adopt it
[55:19] right right no right well you better get
[55:21] ready because I'm going in the house
[55:24] running up with this dying life because
[55:27] this guy would he weighed 475 pounds
[55:29] most of you know we huh
[55:31] and hit it you know he was driving this
[55:34] point I said I'm going in the house and
[55:35] get my books you better get what you're
[55:37] talking about we're gonna talk with the
[55:38] Bible this Prophet said that when I came
[55:41] back out and laid it all down
[55:44] forget it the only thing you wouldn't
[55:47] convert me
[55:49] right because it's water blood and
[55:50] spirit
[55:51] adoption goes into water blood spirit
[55:54] and the word carrying you up a statue
[55:57] man that's adoption right four stages
[55:59] but it's only three stages to the birth
[56:01] right we've done read it never want to
[56:03] go the third three men she gives a nice
[56:06] 380 is complete suburbate all right
[56:09] so you can do all of these things that
[56:11] we talk about and still not be born
[56:13] again
[56:14] that's right amen I gave them to you
[56:17] there the other day
[56:19] and look what let's see
[56:22] be number six for the coach
[56:26] Anderson
[56:28] we went through this and
[56:29] go through it through each age God says
[56:33] allotted so much work
[56:36] and the church that gets it all confused
[56:38] now then he sends a prophet among them
[56:40] vindicates the word it's just not any
[56:43] other time we speak today and see that
[56:46] we speak today and say the Methodist
[56:48] Luther says you believe that's all you
[56:51] have to do you're justified by faith
[56:53] blue I mean he said they believed and
[56:54] didn't have it
[56:56] huh and it's your profit we know that a
[56:59] long game we actually ruled what called
[57:01] second work of Grace sanctification all
[57:03] that shouts in there Sanctified has got
[57:06] it many shouted and didn't have it long
[57:09] come to come to Pentecost said all that
[57:11] speaks with tongues has got it many
[57:13] spoke with tongues and didn't have it
[57:17] Along come Christian Science and says
[57:20] it's love the fruit of the spirit many
[57:22] of them showed fruits of the spirit and
[57:25] don't have it now you know what it
[57:26] connects that to when he gets to that
[57:28] point he said what about the condo
[57:30] priest
[57:31] who dedicated your babies who loaned you
[57:34] money when you needed all this and took
[57:35] care of you and said and said all Jesus
[57:38] ever done he just took and planted a
[57:39] rope and run them out of Temple
[57:43] all right
[57:45] you know what he's getting to right but
[57:47] look
[57:52] number seven
[57:56] what shall we do with Jesus called
[57:58] Christ 64 126.
[58:01] the evidence that I said the other day
[58:04] we try to place evidence Luther said
[58:06] believe and walk out
[58:08] the devil believes to Wesley's good
[58:10] shout you got it but found out he didn't
[58:13] I didn't mean to Western Avenue work you
[58:16] know what he's saying come on and it all
[58:19] said speak in tongues and you got it
[58:20] they didn't Christian Science says love
[58:23] you got the fruit of the spirit but they
[58:25] haven't they denied the divinity
[58:28] of Jesus Christ
[58:30] what is the evidence of it
[58:33] when that Spirit that's in you
[58:36] can punctuate every promise with an amen
[58:43] now that does away with all the shout
[58:44] and all of this and all of this out of
[58:46] the other all that's well and good
[58:50] we believe in every bit of it
[58:53] because that's just your nature
[58:56] and brother brownie even made a
[58:57] statement this way one time he said
[58:58] where you're born again at does has a
[59:01] lot to do with you even after you're
[59:03] born again he said if you're born again
[59:05] in an emotional Church you'll be
[59:06] emotional he says you're born again and
[59:08] kind of a formal type of church he said
[59:10] you'll be that way all right
[59:13] if you want that quarter be glad to find
[59:15] that
[59:16] look what is the evidence of it when
[59:19] that Spirit that's in you can punctuate
[59:21] every promise with an amen and God will
[59:24] confirm it
[59:27] see so you've got God confirming it
[59:29] right you believe in it right
[59:33] that's exactly the way it was with Jesus
[59:35] Christ
[59:37] now look what he said you read it
[59:40] so when Jesus Christ what was it the
[59:42] spirit of in him would punctuate every
[59:44] word
[59:45] and then God confirmed it all right yes
[59:48] they had they had more fruits of the
[59:49] spirit they had all kinds of evidences
[59:52] you could pin any evidence down to
[59:55] anything you can't still repent any
[59:57] evidence down to anything but God
[1:00:00] himself manifesting his word that's the
[1:00:03] only true evidence that there is that
[1:00:05] you or you're a Christian how can you be
[1:00:08] a Christian when I go and let me ask you
[1:00:11] to say some more quotes that are laid
[1:00:12] there if you want them but everyone said
[1:00:14] how can God deny his word right yeah
[1:00:18] he said can God deny his own word he
[1:00:22] said well then how can the spirit of God
[1:00:23] be in you and deny his word amen
[1:00:29] he's playing around with it right
[1:00:32] okay go ahead to the next
[1:00:36] Jesus came and called 64-13
[1:00:39] who has the fruit of spirit there and
[1:00:40] he's talking about you know not the
[1:00:41] fruit of the spirit not speaking in
[1:00:43] tongues and shouting you said then
[1:00:44] brother Branham what is the evidence
[1:00:46] what is the evidence
[1:00:48] the vindication
[1:00:50] of the word in the hour
[1:00:56] the Vindication of the word in the hour
[1:01:00] read all in between there and come down
[1:01:01] look Luther had the evidence of his age
[1:01:04] Wesley of his age Pentecost of his age
[1:01:07] but we're in another age
[1:01:10] those things are good but like the baby
[1:01:13] has got a finger and I knows but after a
[1:01:16] while he has to become a human being he
[1:01:19] has to become a a mature child to then
[1:01:23] be born have a soul body Spirit move
[1:01:27] around
[1:01:29] turn it all together with where we're at
[1:01:32] all right
[1:01:33] look at the next one
[1:01:35] what is the evidence
[1:01:42] message and when their their eyes were
[1:01:44] opened they knew him 1964 4 16.
[1:01:49] but what is the evidence of a believer
[1:01:57] that will but believe the identified
[1:01:59] word of the hour
[1:02:01] it's always been that way
[1:02:07] people get it scrupled up in all kind of
[1:02:09] traditions and religion and the
[1:02:11] nominations and education and so forth
[1:02:13] but God comes along with his word and
[1:02:15] concerns it confirms it for the hour
[1:02:17] that's the evidence that's right
[1:02:27] let me put it this way
[1:02:32] to believe brother Brown's message is
[1:02:34] wonderful
[1:02:37] but do you believe Luther's message
[1:02:38] right
[1:02:40] Buffet
[1:02:45] do you believe Wesley's message now
[1:02:47] we're not talking about the fanaticism
[1:02:49] that went with it and all the false
[1:02:50] doctrines and the trinitarianisms and
[1:02:52] the garbage right come on Amen Luther
[1:02:55] taught a message to the judge you'll
[1:02:56] live by faith and that's Bible right
[1:02:58] that was the only way in the body
[1:03:02] and you come along today and say I don't
[1:03:04] believe what Luther taught what Wesley
[1:03:05] taught okay
[1:03:07] but I got the new birth I believe the
[1:03:10] message of the age I can prove it to you
[1:03:17] I can prove to you you're anointed ones
[1:03:19] what's your life you sure won't like
[1:03:21] that
[1:03:24] but that's his truth as I can be
[1:03:28] I mean only anointed Ones Will Follow
[1:03:29] that line of thought right anointed ones
[1:03:32] will deny other ages as to having
[1:03:35] the new birth
[1:03:37] I'm trying to base everything up on them
[1:03:39] having the new birth
[1:03:44] okay
[1:03:47] now look what he says
[1:03:54] what is the evidence of a believer
[1:03:56] we covered that
[1:03:58] look what he says now broken system
[1:04:04] 1964 726 the evening service
[1:04:07] the day I was talking with a good friend
[1:04:09] Dr Lee Vale who is present now he's
[1:04:12] quite a theologian and so we usually
[1:04:14] have some have some pretty good
[1:04:16] discussions on the scripture very smart
[1:04:18] he asked me one time what I thought
[1:04:21] about the initial evidence of the Holy
[1:04:23] Ghost
[1:04:24] was it speaking in tongues
[1:04:26] it's been many years ago I said no
[1:04:30] can't see that he said neither do I said
[1:04:34] though I've been taught that he said
[1:04:36] what would you think would be an
[1:04:38] Evidence
[1:04:40] I said the most perfect evidence I can
[1:04:43] think of
[1:04:45] is love
[1:04:47] so we got to talking on that
[1:04:50] and I thought that sounded pretty good
[1:04:52] so I just held that
[1:04:54] and all that if a man has got love but
[1:04:58] one day the Lord in a vision
[1:05:00] straightened me out
[1:05:02] now this is your Prophet okay
[1:05:07] he said that the evidence of the spirit
[1:05:09] was those who could receive the word
[1:05:12] leader love not speaking in tongues but
[1:05:15] it's receiving the word
[1:05:21] so that's the Holy Ghost giving you a
[1:05:23] clear understanding of the word right
[1:05:24] okay
[1:05:26] and he goes down the Holy Ghost is upon
[1:05:29] you you shall reveal these things that
[1:05:30] I've taught you and show you things to
[1:05:32] come
[1:05:33] so there is a genuine evidence of the
[1:05:35] Holy Ghost he has never told me anything
[1:05:37] wrong yet that it's the evidence of the
[1:05:40] Holy Ghost it's he who can believe the
[1:05:42] word
[1:05:43] you can receive it because Jesus never
[1:05:46] said when the Holy Ghost has come you'll
[1:05:48] speak with tongues
[1:05:51] now show me in the bible really
[1:05:54] he never said the Holy Ghost come you'd
[1:05:56] do any of those things but he said he
[1:05:59] will take
[1:06:00] these things of mine and show them to
[1:06:04] you and will show you things that is to
[1:06:07] come so there is the genuine evidence of
[1:06:09] the Holy Ghost According To Jesus
[1:06:11] himself
[1:06:13] all right
[1:06:14] According To Jesus himself
[1:06:18] all right
[1:06:20] I wonder where does that put us
[1:06:24] questions and answers
[1:06:27] 1964 823 the evening service
[1:06:32] what is the evidence that a person is
[1:06:34] really Fielding the Holy Ghost
[1:06:37] now that would have been questions and
[1:06:39] answers let's see broken sinistering
[1:06:41] would have been 728 this is 8 23. so
[1:06:45] this is the same year a little later on
[1:06:47] what is the evidence that a person is
[1:06:49] really feeling the Holy Ghost John 14
[1:06:51] 26. he said when the Holy Ghost has come
[1:06:53] see he will show you things to come see
[1:06:56] he'll be a he'll perfect it
[1:07:01] perfect it man mage
[1:07:04] won't do it and he is the word
[1:07:06] and when the Holy Ghost has come he will
[1:07:08] identify himself in you with the
[1:07:10] scripture and that is the true sign that
[1:07:12] the holy spirit is in you because it is
[1:07:15] the word
[1:07:17] now look what if you spoke with tongues
[1:07:19] I just want to ask that Jesus said when
[1:07:21] the Holy Ghost come what he would do but
[1:07:25] what if you spoke with him jumped up and
[1:07:26] down shouted and everything else and
[1:07:28] then come to the word
[1:07:29] and
[1:07:31] tell you the baptism of prove to you by
[1:07:35] the scripture as I have that the baptism
[1:07:37] using the title of Father Son and Holy
[1:07:39] Ghost is absolutely a misunderstanding
[1:07:41] in the scripture nobody was ever
[1:07:43] baptized like that and you go ahead and
[1:07:45] hang with it anyhow could you tell me
[1:07:48] the holy spirit in you would do a thing
[1:07:51] like that how can it deny its own word
[1:07:54] right amen
[1:07:56] simple language right
[1:07:58] how can it deny its own word
[1:08:03] let's see one more
[1:08:07] well let's leave that off
[1:08:09] come on no further
[1:08:11] we just stopped right there on the
[1:08:13] evidence
[1:08:15] that's why
[1:08:16] whether or not the spirit in you agrees
[1:08:19] wouldn't work
[1:08:20] now what if it agrees so long to quit
[1:08:25] now that's not what he's talking about
[1:08:26] right
[1:08:28] whether or not it keeps on agreeing with
[1:08:29] the words
[1:08:31] now Jesus agreed with every word
[1:08:35] so now if I throw down your Doctrine or
[1:08:37] thought tonight or what you believe the
[1:08:39] new birth is
[1:08:41] then you need to do something about it
[1:08:43] right and get mad at me won't hit it
[1:08:46] that's right but you know that's what it
[1:08:48] is ain't nobody gets mad at Jesus for
[1:08:49] saying it you know do you ever notice
[1:08:51] that yeah you notice that people you can
[1:08:53] read what brother Brown says to them and
[1:08:55] they won't get mad at him
[1:08:57] they get mad at you for reading it
[1:09:01] you're a smart addict you found it
[1:09:04] found it
[1:09:06] I found what he said
[1:09:10] why don't you get mad at him
[1:09:12] why don't you get upset with him
[1:09:18] why aren't you upset with God
[1:09:20] 's what it said it
[1:09:23] I've always said it this way and I don't
[1:09:24] mind saying it if there is a God
[1:09:27] that's not a question on my hand I have
[1:09:29] no problem with it
[1:09:31] but if there is a God and he can't keep
[1:09:33] his word straight
[1:09:35] then what are we going to look for
[1:09:39] or what are we going to talk about right
[1:09:43] but if you can keep his work straight
[1:09:45] and it's been straight all the way
[1:09:46] through and the birth has always been
[1:09:48] the same
[1:09:50] no matter what age it was in the New
[1:09:52] Birth was the same it was the birth of
[1:09:55] the word of that age
[1:09:58] and so is it today
[1:10:03] you can't depend upon just
[1:10:06] I repented of my sins nope that's right
[1:10:10] that's wonderful
[1:10:12] I got Sanctified I quit all these things
[1:10:15] and all that that's wonderful amen
[1:10:22] but we got to have the baptism in the
[1:10:24] Holy Ghost
[1:10:28] if we don't have the bad kids when the
[1:10:29] Holy Ghost we're still in a lost
[1:10:30] condition right
[1:10:32] right when I went as well as you said
[1:10:33] you gave a Sunday word you told me yeah
[1:10:35] I should try to run around and said you
[1:10:36] have eternal life it just believes it
[1:10:39] the team you put together all the other
[1:10:41] things and where he said where he said
[1:10:43] even in sanctification you're just
[1:10:45] begotten you're not even converted yet
[1:10:46] that was the next quote that was fixing
[1:10:48] to come up
[1:10:49] he said you're not even converted yet
[1:10:53] he told Peter he said
[1:10:55] Thou Art converted
[1:10:58] strengthen the brethren
[1:11:00] if it was only the shouting to scream
[1:11:03] into crying the believing and why did
[1:11:05] Jesus have to die because the disciples
[1:11:07] had all of it
[1:11:09] yeah but that's where you wouldn't like
[1:11:10] the point that there was Judas is caring
[1:11:15] and you know the Judas is carried
[1:11:17] according to the church age book and
[1:11:19] according to the prophet giving you the
[1:11:21] scripture there his name was written in
[1:11:23] heaven
[1:11:25] that's right
[1:11:27] because your name is written when you're
[1:11:29] a believer
[1:11:32] come on I can show you that because you
[1:11:34] know it
[1:11:36] Judas was right there with him until the
[1:11:38] Holy Ghost entered into him right
[1:11:40] and then he went out and done what he
[1:11:42] done
[1:11:44] do you know what I like about him
[1:11:47] you know what I like about Judas
[1:11:50] he found out what he'd done
[1:11:52] he found out he had denied the Lord
[1:11:55] Jesus
[1:11:57] he had enough gumption to go hang
[1:11:59] yourself
[1:12:02] and yet we sat down in church and holy
[1:12:05] Glory Hallelujah I believe the prophet's
[1:12:07] message shoutings and everything else is
[1:12:09] all it is you brother there you just
[1:12:10] don't believe it because you're an old
[1:12:12] die-high Baptist
[1:12:14] you know
[1:12:17] you better understand what random come
[1:12:19] from
[1:12:22] hmm
[1:12:25] I've been to foot washes communion in
[1:12:28] the Baptist Church
[1:12:31] how many of you ever went through Marty
[1:12:34] really didn't went one time and they had
[1:12:36] a communion then I had the foot wash
[1:12:41] I didn't know no water in the paint
[1:12:44] I had a towel
[1:12:49] I'm not going off on that jerk
[1:12:52] come on
[1:12:54] nice people actually in my beds that's
[1:12:56] just like me and you
[1:12:59] but what I'm saying is you see how far
[1:13:01] we drift away from the word
[1:13:10] when you do that and after like I said
[1:13:12] 100 100 years I said I think I said
[1:13:15] Satan for 100 years over you've been
[1:13:18] teaching people about these evidences
[1:13:20] and signs and shoutings and crimes and
[1:13:23] and believings and all that
[1:13:26] God has been trying to get us
[1:13:30] to get to the birth of the word
[1:13:35] brother Dale I just don't have a new
[1:13:37] birth to say that it was on a certain
[1:13:39] day
[1:13:40] well
[1:13:42] I believe that if you'll ask God he'll
[1:13:44] speak to you about it and give it to you
[1:13:46] and you'll know it
[1:13:50] and I was asked Sandy
[1:13:54] how do you know brother Dale what you've
[1:13:55] got was the new bird
[1:14:00] well
[1:14:02] you know the best thing I can say to you
[1:14:06] because I shouted I've cried
[1:14:09] ain't no spoken to others
[1:14:19] but you know what
[1:14:20] I've always believed
[1:14:22] if there is a God
[1:14:25] that he'd be able to keep his words
[1:14:27] straight enough
[1:14:29] the word is I believed it
[1:14:32] he would come to that word in honor it
[1:14:35] all right
[1:14:37] I never saw a great light flashing great
[1:14:40] things happening when I received a new
[1:14:41] birth my wife and I received at the same
[1:14:44] time
[1:14:47] I was crying yes
[1:14:51] I've done that before
[1:14:53] I saw a guy when I was 11 years old in a
[1:14:56] church
[1:14:57] I never counted out of salvation
[1:15:01] I saw a lot of things when I was in the
[1:15:03] Baptist Church
[1:15:06] you know we believe in praying for the
[1:15:08] sick stuff back then
[1:15:13] I tried to live a good life I told you
[1:15:14] about nobody could stand there looking
[1:15:16] at the women come out of the off of a
[1:15:18] bus that's coming to sing for us one
[1:15:20] night and that's your old man there was
[1:15:22] 65 or another he wasn't old man he was
[1:15:25] 65.
[1:15:29] and then they're just looking at him I
[1:15:31] just looked him straight and now I said
[1:15:33] that ain't right
[1:15:36] you're not supposed to look like that
[1:15:40] this is my brother-in-law's Daddy
[1:15:43] I said you're not supposed to look like
[1:15:44] that he said the Bible said look on
[1:15:47] God's Heritage I said it's don't say
[1:15:49] lust I strip
[1:15:54] I didn't play back there
[1:15:56] I set my Deacon board and told him I
[1:15:58] said brother there's something wrong
[1:16:00] around here
[1:16:03] I said there's more money to do
[1:16:05] I take it up and count it
[1:16:08] do I know what's coming in there's more
[1:16:11] money do tied out of this Beacon board
[1:16:14] then the ribs coming in that offering
[1:16:16] plate upstairs
[1:16:20] because I believe what God Said
[1:16:26] he said traffic
[1:16:30] I believed I still believe his word amen
[1:16:33] I Feast on his word I've been in a
[1:16:36] Revival then ever since I come in this
[1:16:38] message
[1:16:40] but did you see something's like no no
[1:16:44] it was a knowledge
[1:16:46] I know that ain't gonna go over what
[1:16:48] most people because they got out more
[1:16:49] than that you know what brother Brown
[1:16:51] said
[1:16:53] God knows what you need and you mind if
[1:16:56] I quote him something
[1:16:57] he said he knows what you need
[1:17:00] and he said if you want to speak in
[1:17:01] tongues you just laid there long enough
[1:17:04] and he'll let you stick in time
[1:17:06] because he's a good God
[1:17:11] now he went against Crime and shouting
[1:17:13] and doing things
[1:17:18] you see all at once the word that I had
[1:17:20] studied so long just began to unveil
[1:17:22] come on
[1:17:24] amen and I've seen Christ right amen
[1:17:27] writing his word
[1:17:30] right
[1:17:31] I've seen it then for myself amen before
[1:17:35] then I was taking what brother Brown had
[1:17:37] to say about it
[1:17:39] that's right sure
[1:17:41] when that happened Hallelujah I had
[1:17:44] something on my own amen
[1:17:49] well you think everybody know known
[1:17:50] because according to your emotional
[1:17:52] system
[1:17:53] I've explained that a while ago it's
[1:17:55] according to your emotional system
[1:17:57] like I said you want these quotes call
[1:17:59] me whatever runaround said
[1:18:02] God's a good God
[1:18:04] he said he knows you won't speak in
[1:18:06] tongues he said you just laid out long
[1:18:08] enough in the election that's right
[1:18:13] hey
[1:18:17] but all of that doing we read it
[1:18:20] I don't have to be the only
[1:18:25] the holy but the Holy Ghost can't deny
[1:18:26] his word
[1:18:28] now let me put one more with it I didn't
[1:18:31] bring the quote
[1:18:33] run around and see it
[1:18:36] the way you know whether a preacher is
[1:18:38] relying on is whether he's staying with
[1:18:39] the word
[1:18:42] continually staying with the word
[1:18:46] he said then
[1:18:48] you just checked out what he's saying
[1:18:51] I'm just paraphrasing it but just you
[1:18:53] just check what he's saying to see if
[1:18:55] it's right
[1:18:58] because he can't tell you something
[1:19:00] wrong
[1:19:04] I'm sorry
[1:19:11] not the word
[1:19:13] so you check the preacher by the word
[1:19:17] amen that's what I was asking God
[1:19:20] this man says
[1:19:22] prophets will come what if each one of
[1:19:24] them
[1:19:25] because you know I go down the street or
[1:19:27] I learn somebody say prophets will come
[1:19:29] they're false and I know that was you
[1:19:31] know and he's off the word
[1:19:35] not only the Holy Ghost should put the
[1:19:37] word together amen that's what I love
[1:19:40] about you
[1:19:41] only the Holy Ghost can put the word
[1:19:43] together
[1:19:46] you know what I've been called an
[1:19:47] intellectual Baptist because of that
[1:19:52] so you wouldn't know what that meant if
[1:19:53] you haven't been there and studied but
[1:19:56] it just simply meant that I had taken
[1:19:58] the letter of the word and figured it
[1:20:00] out
[1:20:01] Miranda said you better leave them
[1:20:02] Baptists alone
[1:20:06] he said they'll tie you up in that
[1:20:08] scripture
[1:20:11] now as you see they take it and read it
[1:20:13] right out of the word to you
[1:20:18] and you can fall over and shout and
[1:20:20] glory to Hallelujah all you want to it
[1:20:23] ain't going to change them
[1:20:26] we'll just stay right there with the
[1:20:27] word
[1:20:30] it is also written right that's it
[1:20:35] what is the evidence of the baptism and
[1:20:38] all the others whether or not the spirit
[1:20:40] of God in you agrees with the word and
[1:20:42] if the spirit of God is in you he will
[1:20:45] always agree with the word
[1:20:49] he will never deny his word
[1:20:52] that's why I wrote around said if you
[1:20:53] could find it in this Bible
[1:20:57] go before God and said if he won't
[1:20:59] fulfill it you can call him alive
[1:21:03] Now That's How Strong he believed in the
[1:21:05] world Amen
[1:21:07] Jesus sowed it took him three and a half
[1:21:10] years
[1:21:12] to show down enough scripture
[1:21:15] into those people for them to get around
[1:21:17] again
[1:21:19] Mustang
[1:21:23] to be able to to get the people to a
[1:21:26] place
[1:21:30] where we got 119 a Red Bull 119 in the
[1:21:35] regular you might have a knee the only
[1:21:37] thing I say to you is one thing if you
[1:21:39] do or not you have the baptism of the
[1:21:41] Holy Ghost never stop seeking that's
[1:21:43] right that's right it ain't important
[1:21:45] who's the presidential election the
[1:21:47] other day and brought around him away he
[1:21:48] started out talking we was on a tape the
[1:21:50] way he started out talking just like he
[1:21:52] was going to name it he said who's going
[1:21:54] to be the president
[1:21:59] you know what he said
[1:22:01] he said even if I could tell you
[1:22:05] he said the whole religion the whole
[1:22:08] world would flock at the door and all
[1:22:10] the newspapers would print
[1:22:12] William brownham said so and so is going
[1:22:15] to be president
[1:22:20] Eternal gods
[1:22:24] they're still a prophet
[1:22:25] that could have told him
[1:22:29] he could have told him it was going to
[1:22:31] be that God would have either yep
[1:22:34] but he could stand there and preach the
[1:22:36] word and it wouldn't be be put in a
[1:22:38] newspaper that so many people got saved
[1:22:41] so many people got healed the dead was
[1:22:44] raised never was put in a newspaper
[1:22:48] but he said if you could tell who was
[1:22:50] going to be president he said your name
[1:22:51] would be in the paper and be printed all
[1:22:53] over
[1:22:56] what about it
[1:23:02] I told him one time in a Minister's
[1:23:04] meeting I said you want to know who's
[1:23:05] going to be president I'm going to tell
[1:23:06] you or something like that I want to do
[1:23:08] it

[1:30:07] told you this mother said I'm I'm
[1:30:08] working on commanding the Lord
[1:30:10] thought I mean
[1:30:11] I'm a boy I just went the other way and
[1:30:13] I never called a black guy anymore
[1:30:14] because I was talking to the devil
[1:30:18] I didn't care nothing in the back online
[1:30:24] Jimmy
[1:30:29] it's not commanding God when you're at
[1:30:37] when you're acting great
[1:31:07] now
[1:31:31] say
[1:31:33] now
[1:31:53] I believe it was way the other day for
[1:31:55] these preachers said
[1:31:57] yes said it he said if God tailed you
[1:32:00] asked God for something he says no
[1:32:04] he said that's the greatest answer you
[1:32:06] could never get
[1:32:08] that's right he said no no no no I want
[1:32:11] it
[1:32:11] he says no
[1:32:13] because you see he knows what you do or
[1:32:15] what you're asking that's right
[1:32:17] those people asked brother ran them
[1:32:21] said where's an oil well
[1:32:23] he said he picked up that they were
[1:32:26] gonna they told him oh we'll do this and
[1:32:28] we'll give them money we'll do that but
[1:32:29] he realized they wouldn't do it right
[1:32:32] he wouldn't tell him
[1:32:34] he said they went out and they dug weld
[1:32:37] around got a little bit of butter
[1:32:38] flutter you know
[1:32:40] somebody come in it didn't he said I
[1:32:42] knew it was a little more
[1:32:44] somebody come in that had nothing to do
[1:32:46] with the church or anything sit down and
[1:32:48] hit the gusher
[1:32:50] he said because they had the wrong
[1:32:53] attitude that's right I told you one was
[1:32:56] over in the Philippines
[1:32:58] Brothers came to me one night and I was
[1:32:59] already a schedule they had me scheduled
[1:33:01] to preach but Ernie went one way and I
[1:33:03] went the other way was trying to cover a
[1:33:04] lot of churches we did
[1:33:07] the brother Ernie and brother Vernon
[1:33:10] came so we want to talk to you said
[1:33:12] you're scheduled to preach on Friday
[1:33:13] night
[1:33:15] okay yeah
[1:33:18] but we're in the world that wasn't sure
[1:33:19] who he was
[1:33:21] like let us know okay that's all right
[1:33:22] we said we'll tell you one thing
[1:33:27] he said won't try to get people they
[1:33:29] want to try to he wants to try to get
[1:33:30] people together
[1:33:32] and take up a lot of money
[1:33:35] because he knew see we wouldn't take it
[1:33:37] you know
[1:33:39] they want to get a lot of money
[1:33:41] because he wants to buy a bunch of goats
[1:33:47] because there's a lot of money that the
[1:33:49] Germans left here in the Philippines
[1:33:53] tons and tons of gold that they've
[1:33:56] captured
[1:33:58] he said he wanted to get some goats to
[1:34:00] sacrifice
[1:34:01] to the Gods
[1:34:04] to try to find in favor to find that
[1:34:07] gold
[1:34:08] this ain't going
[1:34:12] you know how you doing brother
[1:34:15] thank you for telling me they said well
[1:34:17] we knew you wouldn't but we had to tell
[1:34:19] you
[1:34:21] it's not going
[1:34:23] won't be no part of that right
[1:34:26] yeah it wouldn't matter if it had been a
[1:34:28] shitload of gold out there that wouldn't
[1:34:30] matter to me
[1:34:32] I ain't going
[1:34:33] um
[1:34:34] you see you don't use God's gifts
[1:34:39] in the wrong way all right that's right
[1:34:42] I tried my best to explain to ministers
[1:34:46] the same gift that I have to preach the
[1:34:48] gospel like itself
[1:34:50] fried ice cream to an Eskimo
[1:34:52] sure
[1:34:54] I know what a gift is
[1:34:57] you ever deal with me about buying
[1:34:59] something you'll find out but I'll tell
[1:35:01] you my price and I'll never change
[1:35:04] but I didn't give it to you before I
[1:35:06] change my pride
[1:35:10] because I ain't going to use my gift
[1:35:15] I'm not for doing something for the
[1:35:17] world that's right
[1:35:18] my gift is to preach to gospel
[1:35:21] that's right and sometimes I'm so
[1:35:24] embarrassed in my own staff
[1:35:27] my sincerity not enough
[1:35:33] I need more sincerity
[1:35:35] I need more
[1:35:37] you know humbleness before the Lord I
[1:35:39] know that
[1:35:42] I know how gracious she is right because
[1:35:45] he's never failed me yet
[1:35:48] and it wouldn't matter to me to preach
[1:35:49] to 10 or to 10 million
[1:35:54] right it's just the same thing
[1:35:56] yep
[1:35:58] thank God for the truth that's right
[1:36:00] amen father
[1:36:03] we just commit everything into your
[1:36:04] hands or what we've tried to say tonight
[1:36:06] we've tried to make it
[1:36:07] to understand
[1:36:10] We Believe In You Lord and what you can
[1:36:13] do that you can give the new birth right
[1:36:14] all at one time with somebody we believe
[1:36:16] that
[1:36:17] hopefully most of the time it doesn't
[1:36:19] come that way
[1:36:20] it takes up time and we definitely
[1:36:22] believe more in a definite time of
[1:36:25] justification
[1:36:27] when we repented of our sins
[1:36:30] a definite time just like it would be
[1:36:32] when the water broke of the woman
[1:36:34] we believe in a definite time of
[1:36:36] sanctification the cleanse in our lives
[1:36:38] and setting us aside just like it would
[1:36:40] be when the woman with a blood issue
[1:36:43] that comes forward
[1:36:46] we believe in a new birth
[1:36:49] We Believe In You Lord
[1:36:52] bringing your own life and letting it
[1:36:54] come and live and try to get you never
[1:36:55] one of us
[1:36:57] we know that our lives are not worthy of
[1:36:59] anything
[1:37:01] and forgive us Lord of all of the
[1:37:03] uncleanness and things that's within us
[1:37:06] sanctifies set us aside for you Lord
[1:37:10] help us to be what you want us to be we
[1:37:13] love you we thank you in Jesus name
