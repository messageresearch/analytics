========================================

could be in the house of the Lord and missed y all we had a good time traveling over the last few days let's see get this hopefully we can get that up on the screen let's just go the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together today Lord around your word Lord bless us Lord as we walk through these scriptures Lord Jesus make them alive and real to us be with us today Lord bless our worship and our fellowship together we pray in your name amen so we're we're uh I'm I'm going see if I can wrap up the book of Hebrews today we will see I'm optimistic um Proverbs so what we're getting toward is is where Paul's talking about um that we trust we have a good conscience and in all things willing to live honestly and I just kind of been meditating on honesty and what that means and in Proverbs 286 there's that scripture that says better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness than he that is perverse in his ways though he be rich so really what uh the scripture is saying here in this case is that uh to to live a life of integrity and honesty where people are can trust you and can trust your word is more important more it's it's like more precious than than uh than having a lot of money or really anything else um to be able to be Trust trusted what a what a blessing in life that would be to to look back and and and and have confidence that people can trust you and and to trust others now look what so we'll we'll take a quick step back before in in verse 13 17 before we go to verse 18 so Paul says here and all through that chapter in Hebrews 13 He just reiterates over and over remember those that are trying to help you with the word he so he's saying obey them that have the rule over you and we we labor that point the rule the word that the word is actually the thing that captures you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account I was thinking about how God puts this like a almost like a hierarchy the man is always going to have to give an account for the woman so in a relationship he's got to give an account for the the woman the woman the wife is never going to have to give an account for the man's behavior but the man one day will have to give an account for the woman and you keep going up and and there's uh you take you're taking a huge responsibility as a minister because you're actually watching over people's souls and it matters whether you're preaching the truth or whether you're preaching something that ain't because you will have to give an account for that and you are responsible where that's why brother R just said well just say what I said don't uh I was listening to brother Wayne preaching at the Virginia meetings and he was like I don't know he said he was I'm going to it's odd to kind of quote another Minister but he was it was good he was saying that um if you're not just saying what brother brandom said you're in bondage and you're in in you're you're bound and I I thought that was excellent it matters what we're preaching so he's saying uh obey them that have the rule over you submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you so in verse 18 Paul says pray for us for We Trust we have a good conscience so this morning I want to just kind of labor on what that means what is your conscience what does it mean to have a good conscience and why would that be important we trust we have a good conscience in all things willing to live honestly so what what what is a good conscience in 1 Peter chapter 3: 21 it says uh the light figure where unto even baptism so when you go to the water baptism do also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward God so when you start your Christian Journey going down in the water that signifies that you've got a good conscience that your conscience is right that the path is cleared you know what you're supposed to be doing and you're acting in accordance with what that little voice on the inside is telling you you need to do by the resurrection of Jesus Christ so what is cons conscience is is your is your sense of right and wrong so you can kind of see where we're going if you've got a good conscience there's that little some that innate sense down in your heart that everybody's kind of you you you're you've got that to tell you you shouldn't be doing that right or you should be doing it or whatever and if you're acting in accordance with that then you got a good conscience conscience is a person's sense of right and wrong acting as a guide to one's behavior and y'all know we're not using Hollywood that ex said an example but that little Pinocchio that they Disney made their little Jiminy Cricket to be something you could look at as an example of what conscience is Jiminy Cricket sitting there chirping away saying you're not Pinocchio you're not supposed to be doing that or whatever but it's it it's an inner we ain't got a cricket but it's a gift of God that's that's God has given to us to so that we and we'll look at some things that Paul said here in a minute that everybody everybody's got that little kind of notion like I I shouldn't be taking that cookie from the cookie jar I shouldn't be doing it it's an inner feeling or voice that provides Direction and makes you feel guilty when you do something wrong it makes you and oh we we we want to live a life if if you've got a good conscience then you're living a life in peace because you're not behaving in a a way that makes you feel guilty or if you or it's your it's your conscience that makes you feel guilty so if you feel guilty go get it straightened up and then you can have peace so and uh in first Timothy Paul's telling us now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils so you start ignoring that conscience you're listening to the LIE of the devil and these false preachers and listening to the h would and everything every other voice contrary to the word of God and he's saying speaking lies and hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron so you start ignoring that conscience ignoring that voice and after a while what's a hot iron do you know in the Civil War somebody get their arm cut off or something and they take the to stop the blood flow they take a big hot iron and and stick it on that to stop the blood and what would it do it would stop the feeling so you don't feel that nub that's got the nerve endings it's now now you done you seared it so you don't feel anymore and so that's that hot iron if you just stop listening to your conscience it's like you just don't you don't really care anymore and and that's that's the state I think brother Ryan touched on that in the in his last Sunday school message that you can keep going and going and going until you get to a place where you the word of God doesn't really have any effect on your on your heart it doesn't really you've just gone so far that it's seared and now that's what Paul was saying in the latter times that that's how the world would get the state the spiritual state would get to where just people just don't care anymore their conscience is seared and brother Rand will saying the God of this evil age children of Disobedience and the children of obedience has nothing in common one is of the day of light the other one of night and darkness evil age this evil age of Darkness nightclubs dances yet belong to church it's it's okay with their God they don't have any condemnation about it nothing bothers them why I don't condemn me to cut my hair a woman said don't hurt my conscience she's got no more conscience than a snake has got heels I love the way he puts things that's right certainly not she don't know what a conscience is it has been so seared it has been seared so hard till she don't even know what it is that's right walking around over the word of God saying while that's some old fogy don't go up there that's just a bunch of noise and carry on anyhow know no more about God than a hotton top would know about an Egyptian KN another place he'd say in the Oneness of unity he said when that spirit is in there it takes hold of God's Eternal Word and it calls everything contrary to it as though it wasn't no matter what it takes place what the world says what anything else says if God has made the promise the a man that's endued with that spirit will hold on to the promise of God because there's nothing else in his way the church is pure the church is purged by the Holy Spirit their conscience is seared of doubt and unbelief is taken away I thought that was an interesting kind of comparison that the church has been seed of doubt in our conscience now look at like that progression that he's taken us down your cons ience that he can take your conscience your soul the thing that guides you the the thing that you don't even realize as there a lot of time it's it's pulling you from one direction to the other and he can purify your conscience and Purge it so that your your motives and your objectives and your desire is correct but then still in your spirit realm you're battling out you got that battle the constant white dog black dog Battle of battling out whether things are right and true and everything so there's things that are working in different levels MH that God and your soul can can Purge your conscience so that your your desire is is correct now let's let's keep let's keep moving on in Romans chap 2:14-15 he said for when Gentiles who do not have the law by Nature do what the law requires they are a law to themselves even though they do not have the law they show that the work of the law is written on on their hearts while their conscience also Bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them so look at that that he's showing that even somebody that's doesn't know anything about scripture has an innate sense of what's right and wrong within them their conscience Bears witness now Charles Spurgeon would say that conscience is the voice of God in the soul and he said again is the best friend that any man can have it will be the truest Monitor and the most impartial judge but but so many times we don't listen to that there that conscious is that voice it's like I'm something's wrong something's wrong in my life I I need something we'll call it maybe thirst too that thirst that God has given to every man woman boy girl that you know you need something and uh CS Lewis says conscience is a messenger of God speaking his truth in our inward parts and we just read where Paul said everybody's got that conscience Gentiles who don't even have the law but by Nature do what the law requires they are a law to themselves even though they don't have the law so what's a good conscience in Hebrews 10:2 he said because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins and brother Bram said in the law having a shadow he said notice the worshipper once purged has no more desire of sin all right so now we're dealing down in the in the soul right no more conscience the word conscience is desire look and see if that ain't right conscience is what's in it in there making your desires and that's why you can see in the scripture if you love The world and the things of the world the love of the the father is not even in you because your desire that God could change your conscience that thing down on the inside that makes you want things of the world and can change that Purge it so that you don't want to look at things you you shouldn't and you don't want all of those things that a sinner wants your conscience is to do it and your conscience is not to do it it's your desire right and I've got a little picture of of a heart that's got some eternal life eternal fire that's kind of driving it now thank God this morning that God can take a heart and can change it now this is what this is speaking of that can change your desire so that you want the word of God so that you recognize that thing that will satisfy that thirst in you and you start wanting that instead of the things of the world that God can change and you that then you have no more conscience of sins you don't want that anymore more you've been changed and the law having a shadow he said a Believer once coming into Christ and by one Spirit baptized into that body he has perfected forever those that are in Christ Jesus then the things of the world see and the worshipper once purged has no more conscience or the right interpretation of that has no more desire of sin for the worshipper once purged has no more desire or conscience of sin he doesn't even want to sin he he will do things wrong and as soon as he does it he will confess his sins right there and say God forgive me I didn't mean to do that you know it father God never sees it but he has an advocate he has a confession and he makes it now that that all that you know you do something wrong and it really Grieves you it just bothers you that that shows that something's H happening in your heart you just can't get away from it you're just and mess you know you it just bothers you when something you know you say something hurtful to somebody or you uh you know a long list of all the things that could grieve you get grieved down in your heart because you've been changed something's Something's Happened and brother Brown said and he was to pass that way he said I know you prospered your business has been great but won't you take Jesus with you this morning won't you let him go with you he's come for you he's revealing to you now who you are making you know here's here's where he's speaking to that little conscience down on in the heart making you know that little crooked deal that you did the other day that little bad word that you spoke that little smart elic thing you said to that woman or that man he knows it he speaking to you as him talking to your conscience aren't you ashamed of yourself now look look what we're let's not lose sight of the lesson we're we're talking about today that Paul was trying to express we need to live honestly yes and with a good conscience cuz that's how you end up with peace that's how you can go to bed at night and lay your head on your pillow and sleep well if you're doing if you're acting in accordance with what you know what you know is right and you're you're communicating honestly to people that you fellowship with and and and you're you're behaving it's our Behavior it's our character that God's evaluating testing as we're moving up the sture for perfect man how are we acting how are we behaving and we've got to we've got to behave right so that the tutor can go back and say he's acting just like just like Daddy and the uncertain sound brother R said the first time she grieved it back there when she started out running around on her husband he's talking about grieving the conscience and going too far he said there's a separating line there that if it ever crosses it'll never cross back again it'll never come again now that's going back to searing your conscience with that hot iron searing it where there's no feeling you just don't don't care anymore and oh my if there's if there's anybody here this morning that's that's uh putting off responding or just just you know letting things grow cold don't don't do that because you don't want to lose the feeling you don't want to lose the feeling of what's right and wrong where it just doesn't touch you anymore the world wants you to make think that makes you want to think that men ain't supposed to cry and all that kind of stuff but you don't want to lose the feeling where you're touched then the Soul the conscience that once condemns you brother R said isn't there anymore and you've gone all together into intellectual you go join some old cold formal church that don't believe in those things on out into hog eat hog and the first thing you know the soul that condemns you for the first time you told a lie the first time you put on those short clothes the first time you did immoral acts will become so dead to you you won't feel it anymore on and on you'll go and after a while death will catch up with you now that's terrible ain't it so what's of good conscience 1 Peter 3:16 Peter said having a good conscience so that when you are slandered those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame so a good conscience is it results from living in a manner consistent with one's faith in Jesus Christ that that seems real simple but it's it's something that we all struggle with you know down in your heart you know something's right you know you know how you're supposed to live but then if outside you behaving a little bit differently if you that's where you won't have a good conscience it it's almost getting into territory of like a hypocrite I was I was seeing uh I was just looking at what a hypocrite was and one a good EX example is the um I was looking at Stanley Williams was the leader of the Crips gang and during the day back in the 1970s he would lead a little youth meeting that was anti- gangs and he would tell people you don't need to join a gang we're not going to and he during the day that was his his role but at night he was the leader of the Crips and he would go kill the other gang members of the Bloods and you talk about a a a example of what a hypocrite is and see you're never going to be able to have a good conscience if you're in the daytime acting one way and in the night time acting a different way at work you're acting one way and then at church you're acting another way then see it there's something at odds you you come to church and you're trying to put on a show and then you go to work and you're not really you you can't really present you're not presenting the gospel to your to the people that you work with and things and and you're not you're never have there will always be something that's at odds something inside you know something's true but outside you know you're acting contrary to that in Revelation chapter 4 brother R said some people say did I already read this I don't think I did it don't condemn me to wear short hair the women it don't condemn me to wear manicure or makeups or whatever it is it don't condemn me to go to dances it don't condemn me to tell a little white lie it don't condemn me to play bridge in my bridge party you know why you ain't got nothing to condemn that don't hurt my conscience you got no more conscience than a snake has hips I did already read that I read that well well I need you to read it so we needed to hear that twice so what are some good signs of a good conscience you strive to do the right thing you consistently make an effort to do what you believe is right even when it's difficult or unpopular now see that that leader of the Crips he ain't during the daytime he's doing what would have an appearance as real good but at night he's not he's not consistent you feel at peace with your decisions when you make choices that align with your conscience with what you know down in your heart's right then you can lay your head on your pillow at night and you can have peace peace and you are honest and truthful you value honesty and strive to be truthful in your interactions with others even when it might be easier to lie or withhold information now that's why Paul's saying in Hebrews 138 pray for us pray for us pray for us at church that we can we can meet this standard that God's laid out you know why it's so important to be honest as a Christian because we're trying to win souls and how are you going to win Souls if somebody can't have the utmost confidence in you I want my children that's why sometimes you know you you you say things I'd ATT turn with your kids and everything and I'd go to them at night and like I've gone to Zach before and get down beside his bed and kneel beside him and say look I'm sorry and apologize for things that you said the way that you've acted why because you want people to be able to trust you I want my children to be able to trust me trust and honesty is of Paramount importance it's more important than silver and gold pray for us for We Trust we have a good conscience in all things willing to live honestly in everything so what is honesty truthfulness conveying information that is factual factual accurate and free from lies or misrepresentation now a lie is what got us into this mess a lie there in the Garden of Eden is just Twisted just a little bit sincerity expressing your authentic thoughts exactly how you feel just being honest and transparent your feelings and intentions without pretense or any ulterior motives straightforwardness communicating clearly and directly avoiding evasiveness or misleading statements and y'all have heard me say that many times I think the way that the devil can get in and Inter and mess with your family with relationships with the church body and everything it's all down to communication communication is where things Begin to Fall Apart in your family people just don't understand one another I told I thought you were going to take the trash out what it's all down to communication Proverbs 12:22 says lying lips are Abomination to the Lord but they that deal truly are his Delight Colossians 3:9-10 says lie not to one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed and knowledge after the image of him that created him why why is honesty so so important because if in life in life if you got something that's a lie the devil will bring in a lie that will cause a relationship or a situation in your life but the only thing that will bust up that lie like an adab bomb is is the truth you you maybe you have like a family situation I'm I'm winding down here the last couple of minutes you got a family situation where a lie has come in and some maybe there's infidelity or something the only thing that'll straighten that out is the truth the only thing that can set things right is the truth and the truth is like a atam bomb you can drop it on the line and it will blow it away it will it will set everything in order that's why that's why the gospel is represented by truth Jesus is the truth yes and pilot standing there talking to with with the truth right right in front of him and he he didn't recognize it what is truth was his question and Truth was right there truth is what will set us free it will set everything in order the truth and I don't have time to look at some of these other things so we'll just stop there and God bless you and bless the rest of the day amen than
