[10:20] we're going to where we've been reading
[10:25] from first Peter 1:18 for as much as you
[10:30] know that you were not redeemed with
[10:32] corruptible things as silver and gold
[10:34] from your vain conversation received by
[10:37] tradition from your father's but with
[10:40] the precious blood of Christ as of a
[10:42] lamb without blemish and without spot
[10:45] who verily was foreordained before the
[10:48] foundation of the world but was manifest
[10:50] in these last days for you who by him do
[10:54] believe in God that raised him up from
[10:57] the dead and gave him glory
[10:59] that's your faith and your hope might be
[11:02] in God seeing you out purified your
[11:04] souls and obeying the truth through the
[11:06] spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[11:09] Brethren see that you love one another
[11:11] with a pure heart fervently being born
[11:14] again not of corruptible seed but of
[11:19] incorruptible by the Word of God which
[11:22] liveth
[11:22] about us forever man all right then we
[11:26] just jump over one to second Peter 1 it
[11:33] says silent Peter a servant an apostle
[11:35] of Jesus Christ to them that have
[11:38] obtained like precious faith with us
[11:41] through the righteousness of God in our
[11:42] Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be
[11:46] multiplied unto you through the
[11:48] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[11:51] according as his divine power hath given
[11:54] unto us all things that pertain unto
[11:56] life and godliness through the knowledge
[11:59] of him that called us to glory in virtue
[12:01] or by now through the calling so
[12:05] bringing us to and all whereby are given
[12:07] unto us exceeding great and precious
[12:10] promises that by these now the Prophet
[12:14] always them aside by these promises so
[12:18] that's what we'll be speaking on today
[12:19] by these promises as you might be
[12:22] partakers or the divine nature having
[12:25] escaped the corruption that is in the
[12:27] world through lust and beside this
[12:28] giving all diligence add to your faith
[12:30] virtue and to virtue knowledge amen you
[12:34] may be seated
[12:35] Lord that is blessing to the reading of
[12:38] the word know we have been quite some
[12:44] time
[12:46] sticking with the emphases upon the
[12:50] position that we're talking about and
[12:52] what we're trying to bring I hope it
[12:55] doesn't get boring to you because we've
[12:58] tried to drop down we had a real good
[13:01] time last night at the Bible studying in
[13:04] some things and talking about the things
[13:07] of God because you know I'm trying my
[13:12] best I asked the people or told them
[13:14] last night that what I would desire for
[13:17] you to do a brother one time you know he
[13:20] preached a message feed my sheep well I
[13:22] didn't understand him he later years
[13:25] later he told me he said I meant for you
[13:27] to feed my family said you just end them
[13:29] old deep things well I just walked away
[13:32] without having I didn't want to say
[13:34] nothing because if I had I know what
[13:36] were to say it I'd have said you
[13:38] appreciate why don't you teach your
[13:39] children the simple things and then they
[13:41] can understand the deeper things that I
[13:43] try to teach too but that was you know
[13:46] that was all right because see that's
[13:48] that's what I'm trying to do is break it
[13:50] down to talk about because they said
[13:54] their past couple of services I've
[13:56] mentioned it a lot then we say what is
[13:59] the new birth we say well it's the birth
[14:01] of the word well I agree with that good
[14:05] to see our brother and sister back there
[14:07] with us I'm glad to have you with us and
[14:09] we say to you welcome man one time
[14:12] welcome next time part of us you may
[14:14] have been here before if you have you
[14:16] get another what you just got a extra
[14:18] welcome all right
[14:19] but what I'm trying to do is to get us
[14:22] to realize what is the new birth all
[14:27] right and in understanding what the new
[14:30] birth is then we know that in that new
[14:36] birth is all that we have need of in God
[14:40] is the new birth all right now because
[14:44] that just starts the process but I'm
[14:47] trying to get you to think on these
[14:50] things called like I said we say we
[14:52] talked about the new birth we say what
[14:53] is the new birth then people say you
[14:55] know we will ministers we all do say
[14:57] well it's justification st. casing
[14:59] baptism the Holy Ghost well that's true
[15:02] but now children hearing that probably a
[15:07] lot of them we were life not life in it
[15:10] little Bella
[15:12] saying something that brother Dale said
[15:14] the other day about the new birth or not
[15:16] Bella Zoey saying you know and so you
[15:20] just sitting on the floor and talking so
[15:22] you be careful what you're talking about
[15:24] somebody might be listening but see I'm
[15:28] trying to get you and I to understand
[15:32] what's going on and see you as mother
[15:36] and father you tell your children we do
[15:39] the best we can trying to explain cause
[15:41] like I said those children we say just
[15:43] again same case baptism or logos and
[15:45] they said well what's justification you
[15:47] know what sanctification
[15:50] what's the baptism with Allah go see
[15:52] they don't get the full understanding so
[15:56] try to help them to understand and that
[15:59] way I can move on into the process
[16:03] because we've been so long right here on
[16:05] this one little point trying to get it
[16:08] to where we can move on into the growth
[16:11] development of Peter and add to your
[16:14] faith virtue or dollars to enforce
[16:15] patience and all I can see because doing
[16:18] that now we say well what is the new
[16:19] birth
[16:20] what's the birth of the word and that's
[16:22] that's that should be settled in all of
[16:25] our hearts and minds Jesus Christ was
[16:28] the sower of the seed the son of man he
[16:31] sowed the seed all right He gave His
[16:34] life he went to Calvary gave his life
[16:37] and then the Holy Spirit came back to
[16:39] quicken what he had sold down in the
[16:43] hearts of those disciples right he he
[16:49] opened up their understanding of the
[16:52] word that they heard alright and
[16:56] seasoned there is your new birth all
[17:00] right let's see we we have been so long
[17:02] in our lives handled and you know ever
[17:05] what you call it living in the realms of
[17:09] of people and their ideas until you say
[17:13] to most people what would happen if you
[17:15] went to most churches today and say what
[17:17] is the new birth well wanted to say we
[17:20] spoke in tongues well other churches say
[17:24] well we shout it we cried we done this
[17:27] we done that well that's not the new
[17:32] birth that's that's the aftereffect see
[17:41] that's what happens I've drew it but yet
[17:43] that's what people think they say where
[17:45] are you born yes I I remember when I
[17:48] cried in it and I like whoa that's not
[17:51] to birth I've tried to get that to you
[17:55] over and over for 50 years now that's
[17:58] not the birth the birth brings the baby
[18:02] into the world right
[18:04] baby natural baby natural birth comes
[18:07] into the world all right and then it
[18:11] starts crying after the baby gets here
[18:16] we'll see we're calling what we do in
[18:19] our natural lives which is the
[18:21] stimulation upon our senses of life or
[18:24] our doings and all we call that to birth
[18:27] you say well what did you well I cried
[18:30] well that's wonderful
[18:33] but that's what you're supposed to be
[18:36] doing after the birth comes that's not
[18:39] the birth the birth is the birth of the
[18:41] word and the prophets it is a revelation
[18:43] of Jesus Christ personally to you and
[18:50] then you say that to people well I
[18:52] didn't get no revelation when I got born
[18:54] again we don't remember when God was
[19:00] dealing with it you don't remember the
[19:05] thing you know we call it our of being
[19:08] you know brought under conviction things
[19:12] happening like that you know that would
[19:15] bring us to a place that we become of a
[19:18] realization of that we're sinners well
[19:21] what do you think that is that's God
[19:23] dealing with you but that's not your
[19:26] birth
[19:28] that's the after-effects that's the
[19:31] things are the attributes that you're
[19:35] going through the life you're going
[19:36] through the birth is a birth of the word
[19:39] the let's see then that's so hard to try
[19:43] to get people to realize that hey you
[19:46] know what is the new birth it's the
[19:49] birth of the word Jesus Christ preached
[19:52] for three and a half years to those
[19:54] disciples never gave one of them eternal
[19:57] life he had to die go to Calvary come
[20:02] back on their Pentecost
[20:03] then it says he'll bring to your
[20:05] remembrance whatsoever he said and teach
[20:07] you things to come he opened their
[20:09] understanding of the word he brought
[20:11] that to them life in their soul of the
[20:14] new birth right then they cried
[20:18] then they shouted didn't it
[20:21] you know then the emotions come but we
[20:23] put the emotions first we think that the
[20:27] new birth is the emotions that we have
[20:30] no it comes because of the birth it
[20:36] comes because of the realization well
[20:40] brother tell you this is your just
[20:41] trying to tell me that I didn't get
[20:42] saved why would you think that because
[20:48] somebody has told you those things is
[20:50] the way you are when you're saved the
[20:55] salvation is first the baby gets here
[21:00] right the baby is born now is it true
[21:05] that Jesus was telling Nicodemus the
[21:07] natural birth is a type of the spiritual
[21:10] birth water blood life all right see
[21:16] then the new birth is what God dealing
[21:20] with you calling you to repentance now
[21:26] you're dealing with justification
[21:28] because that brings you to repentance
[21:30] and that justification then is a
[21:32] chopping off of your pie sins remitting
[21:36] your sins because you're you know that
[21:40] he's dealing with you all right but
[21:43] that's not to birth brother down
[21:48] you mean when i repent into my sins that
[21:51] wasn't a born-again experience i'm not
[21:53] saying it wasn't but i'm saying the big
[21:56] biggest portion of it's not I'm not
[22:01] gonna tell you you didn't get saved
[22:02] because you got examples in the Bible
[22:05] you've got the Apostles for three and a
[22:07] half years before they got their new
[22:10] birth but you got them they're 3,000
[22:13] outside it got the new birth right
[22:14] daughter you've got them at the house of
[22:17] Cornelius right there
[22:18] so don't discredit I'm not saying that
[22:21] you're not saved
[22:22] I'm saying make sure don't put it this
[22:27] don't because you repented of your sins
[22:33] the goodness of God the Bible said
[22:36] leadeth us to repentance you know
[22:38] realizing God is real and realizing that
[22:41] he's dealing with our hearts and our
[22:43] lives and we're accepting him as our
[22:46] Savior
[22:47] we'll remember why the Prophet said it's
[22:49] good for you to accept him you've got to
[22:52] accept him he can only work on the basis
[22:54] of you accepting him but then has he
[22:57] accepted you and you realize
[23:01] justification is you accepting him as
[23:04] your Savior you asking him to forgive
[23:06] you of your sins
[23:07] you're repenting of the things that
[23:09] you've done in your life
[23:11] all right that's justification that's
[23:15] the water breaking of the of the natural
[23:17] baby all right but see then the next
[23:21] step is sanctification that God deals
[23:23] with you to clean up our lives clean up
[23:28] our spiritual parts of us our lives and
[23:31] everything - you know to keep then
[23:33] repenting and asking God to help us and
[23:36] goddess and he cleanses us he takes away
[23:40] those desires and we come up with new
[23:43] desires with ours the danger of people
[23:46] that's that what do you mean brother
[23:48] Dale I went to the altar I cried I used
[23:51] to do this I used to drink I used to
[23:53] smoke I used to run around with women I
[23:55] used to do that and I quit that you mean
[23:58] tell me I'm not saved I will remind you
[24:06] that Judas Iscariot went through
[24:11] justification of believing on the Lord
[24:14] Jesus Christ and walked with him for
[24:16] three and a half years of sanctification
[24:18] but he never made it to the day of
[24:20] Pentecost am i right
[24:23] he never made it to the day of Pentecost
[24:26] to receive eternal life right so come on
[24:31] then don't you know just think about
[24:33] what I've been trying to bring to you
[24:35] and then you can say my experience in my
[24:41] experience I remember when God come up
[24:44] me in such a manner that I was weeping I
[24:46] was crying I was concerned all that's
[24:50] well and good
[24:54] all that's well and good but did it take
[24:59] you all the way justification and
[25:03] sanctification is dealing with you
[25:05] accepting God and you repenting of your
[25:07] sins and asking God to forgive you but
[25:11] when he gives you the baptism when the
[25:12] Holy Ghost that's when he accepts you
[25:16] right that's when he accepts you now
[25:20] you're right with the Prophet right see
[25:26] there's nothing to say well I accepted
[25:28] him it's whether or not he accepted you
[25:32] now you've got something to anchor it
[25:34] into the Word of God and to realize that
[25:38] Jesus sewed that seed down in those
[25:41] disciples the word for three and a half
[25:45] years but yet when they finished up
[25:52] after his capture and taking him in they
[25:56] proved that they wouldn't ride oh yeah
[26:01] Peter he was role he wasn't he was a
[26:03] robust man he grabbed a sword he whacked
[26:05] off that high priest servants the year
[26:08] yeah but when Jesus took that ear and
[26:13] stuck it back on and turned around and
[26:14] didn't fight
[26:15] Peter was ready to run with the rest of
[26:18] them and he did see then they didn't
[26:22] have the new birth you can't bring the
[26:24] new birth in the Old Testament where are
[26:28] you going to put it you can't put it
[26:29] except in the blood of Jesus Christ they
[26:32] had to tone but in the Old Testament as
[26:34] I've tried to explain they offered the
[26:36] animal sacrifices amen but that could
[26:40] not take away and give them eternal life
[26:44] because it was an animal life an animal
[26:47] does not have a soul he has a spirit
[26:51] part about him he has the certain degree
[26:54] in a memories
[26:56] certain degrees in things in there but
[26:58] yet he does not have the soul that's the
[27:00] difference between a dog and a human
[27:02] being see in Jesus Christ was a human
[27:06] being not just a dog why did he have to
[27:10] come and die if it wouldn't Rock if the
[27:14] Old Testament could take care of all the
[27:16] problems and the offering of the
[27:18] sacrifices and all of the doings if that
[27:21] was right and it was for the time but if
[27:24] it was enough why did you hop Jesus out
[27:27] to die see he had to die to release that
[27:32] soul out of him that that soul could
[27:35] come back into the people in the new
[27:38] birth so it's not just well I know I'm
[27:43] saved you can't tell me I say because I
[27:45] cried I accepted Jesus Christ and I just
[27:48] cried all amen don't you think Judas
[27:56] when his last hours were seeking some
[28:01] way to get rid of what his problems was
[28:04] but it didn't work because he had
[28:08] already sealed his doom do you
[28:12] understand what I'm getting at
[28:14] see then we say what is the new birth
[28:16] it's the birth of the word what do you
[28:19] mean all I got to do is read it no it's
[28:23] got to be birthed you and we planted a
[28:27] garden Friday Lisa said something to me
[28:31] yesterday and I said it's already coming
[28:33] up then he says it ain't done it either
[28:37] and they had enough time she said but
[28:40] when it comes up and be two shoots of
[28:42] that corn woman no huh
[28:44] see what do you do with a seed you hold
[28:48] it in your hands oh oh look what I've
[28:49] got
[28:49] look what I've got you got to put that
[28:55] in the ground the moisture has to get to
[28:57] the seed and then it sprouts open and
[29:00] comes alive right and see that's what
[29:04] the Lord Jesus done he planted that word
[29:06] and then the Holy Ghost came on to that
[29:09] any calls and quick on that word to
[29:14] those disciples and see that's that's
[29:17] been a hard point for me to try to get
[29:19] it across to you maybe it's me but you
[29:24] see there's no eternal life back in that
[29:27] Old Testament because Jesus Christ has
[29:29] not died there was a looking forward to
[29:33] you know that Jesus the scripture
[29:35] quarter he died for the sins of all well
[29:40] if he died for the sins of all you know
[29:43] no it's got to be applied it's got to
[29:47] come to you and I as an experience then
[29:52] what did your prophet say surgeries ever
[29:59] something you know I'll get it the
[30:01] minute was I got it laying here in a
[30:02] note he said the mystery of this day was
[30:06] to receive the baptism in the Holy Ghost
[30:08] without a sensation but the person of
[30:12] Jesus Christ see now you go back to the
[30:17] man that found a track you remember the
[30:20] story he found a track and it said where
[30:24] will you spend eternity and he spends
[30:27] all of his life and all of his money
[30:28] trying to find eternal life right he
[30:35] went to all the preachers whenever were
[30:36] to get her to pray far it's been all
[30:38] kind of money you know the story he come
[30:41] to brother Branham and brother Brown
[30:42] said today you picked that track that's
[30:45] word started but you see we think it's
[30:49] got to be some kind of an emotional
[30:51] thing you go to a Pentecostal church
[30:53] today they're gonna try to get you speak
[30:56] in tongues you go to this one I want you
[30:59] to do this this one wants you to do that
[31:01] but what is it all based on it's the
[31:04] birth of the word the words you heard
[31:08] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[31:11] the word it's impossible for you to be
[31:13] saved without hearing the word from
[31:15] somebody
[31:17] right it may be just mama send it to
[31:21] your daddy send it to your or something
[31:23] like adder or whatever but it's you've
[31:27] got to hear that word first then that
[31:32] word is made alive now you've got all of
[31:35] your emotions that you can go with
[31:40] you've got everything you can go with as
[31:43] to say I believe I done that I went I
[31:49] felt you know convicted
[31:52] I felt condemned and asked God to
[31:56] forgive me and I had this great
[31:57] experience I've heard many of you
[32:00] express it as to a great load of sin
[32:03] went off of you well that's true because
[32:08] look what you've done you repented of
[32:09] your sins but that don't mean it's
[32:14] you're saved right there
[32:16] that means you've started just like a
[32:20] baby you want to take your baby and you
[32:24] know brother Kernan Tim's got a little
[32:26] girl back there wouldn't it be something
[32:29] to walk out of the hospital they're
[32:31] going out to get in the car and brother
[32:36] Kern says who's going drive
[32:41] mama you can't drive in I can't
[32:44] who's gonna drive or the baby's gonna
[32:46] drive now that's real sensible intent
[32:51] but I don't want to eat on that to thank
[32:54] my salvation is involved in that away I
[32:56] won't stop them a little more sincere
[33:00] you don't go out and throw the keys to a
[33:02] you better not do it with a 10 year old
[33:05] or a 12 unless they drove a little bit
[33:07] of rounding you gonna get out of trouble
[33:09] you'd be like a lady would start home
[33:11] she'd never drove and and that right
[33:13] beyond the house that was a big old tree
[33:15] and they this lady took her and said I'm
[33:18] gonna teach you to drive what she just
[33:20] pulled up there on the road and stopped
[33:23] got out walked around told her slide
[33:25] over said Drive she said what I ain't
[33:27] never drove I don't know what to do just
[33:29] Geron grouchy did right dead center in
[33:32] the tree when that's as far as you made
[33:35] it was probably 10 foot from the tree
[33:37] you know but see that's not what it is
[33:40] see the experience is that we have the
[33:44] things that we have to go with it
[33:46] I'm not trying to destroy those things
[33:49] in your thinking I'm trying to destroy
[33:56] our thoughts of what is based upon that
[33:59] is not scriptural putting it then to
[34:04] work that we can say to the children to
[34:07] the adults to whoever that the
[34:09] experience is the same now here's one
[34:13] that's been hard for me tried to explain
[34:15] it you know this the last couple of
[34:17] missions you know this ain't even got to
[34:19] my nose but I tried to explain salvation
[34:25] in a simple form to get you to look at
[34:30] it and to see that Jesus Christ come and
[34:35] dealt with you and me called us to
[34:38] repentance and we repented
[34:40] then he deals with us with
[34:42] sanctification which most of us are not
[34:45] even Pentecostal right so we never were
[34:48] taught in the churches we came from
[34:50] about sanctification always Muse maybe
[34:54] the word or head of styles you know but
[34:57] we wasn't taught those things we were
[35:01] taught all you gotta do is believe you
[35:04] just get them come up to order and
[35:05] believe go to shake a preachers hand
[35:08] I'll get them to self Creed or get them
[35:11] to set to order or whatever I've always
[35:17] been like that little boy was when
[35:18] everybody else was saying the preacher
[35:20] asked them do you get saved everybody
[35:22] yeah I got saved like I said they come
[35:24] to one little boy and they said did you
[35:26] get saved he said nothing happened to me
[35:27] yeah I'm just honest I want something
[35:33] that's tangible or real not just a
[35:36] thought of my imaginations or some kind
[35:39] of a thought that I'm a Christian now
[35:41] because there I go to church
[35:45] well I don't cut my hair and I don't
[35:48] paint my face no I'm a Christian well
[35:54] what about those women out there that
[35:55] don't know those things or that
[35:57] Christian see I'm trying to get us to
[36:03] see that what we've been taught all of
[36:06] her life is really the thing that's
[36:07] killing us and it's taught so subtle or
[36:13] whatever the word would mean there it's
[36:16] talk so until I mean the people in sales
[36:20] that's all they know now come on Church
[36:25] I'm not against anybody or any church
[36:27] over here or whatever but what did come
[36:30] up here you accept Jesus Christ as your
[36:31] Savior amen you're born again well I'll
[36:38] remind you Judas Iscariot walked out
[36:40] away a long time then let's see you said
[36:47] well what else can you do you can accept
[36:51] Jesus Christ as your Savior and then you
[36:53] can walk in his word and study it and
[36:56] let it take a part of you until God does
[36:59] something to you himself
[37:06] the work he can work in you and live in
[37:11] you because what is it it's the birth of
[37:15] the word but it's not to give you a
[37:17] bunch of tracks and pies mouth well have
[37:19] you ever read this book this book this
[37:21] book you read all these books you're
[37:23] born again no I've told you before what
[37:28] I've done it I've read six books and one
[37:30] day and listened to tapes that didn't
[37:33] mean and at all that same time I was
[37:35] saying that I was not a born-again
[37:36] Christian and I had come out of a
[37:40] Baptist Church that I was an ordained
[37:41] deacon at 23 years old but yet
[37:49] I seen what the Prophet was talking
[37:50] about I knew there was something wrong
[37:54] something was wrong in the way we was
[37:56] trying to bring it because we were just
[37:59] bringing it as a thought or an idea or a
[38:02] concept brother would be had a good
[38:05] point he said you get him in with a hot
[38:06] dog you can get him out with a hamburger
[38:09] he said well what does that got to do
[38:11] with salvation his point was what if you
[38:14] can get people to come to the altar
[38:15] because of come up here in the shake
[38:17] hands with the preacher believe well
[38:19] then somebody else can praying them over
[38:20] to another one come up here now and and
[38:23] speak in tongues you get them into the
[38:24] hot dog you get them out with a
[38:25] hamburger anything else to would flop
[38:28] there to try to save them but see that
[38:32] we realize what salvation is salvation
[38:37] is God's own life coming to live in you
[38:43] now is that true salvation is God's own
[38:49] life coming to live in you and it could
[38:52] not come and live in you and Hill and
[38:54] the people in the Old Testament because
[38:57] Christ had not come and shed his life
[39:00] all right see the way most people think
[39:05] it any kind of a concept is all that you
[39:07] have to have it's not a concept it's not
[39:13] a doctrine or an idea it's the person of
[39:16] Jesus Christ coming and living in you
[39:19] well I don't understand that then you
[39:22] tell me your son you tell me you're
[39:23] saved but you don't understand you don't
[39:31] understand what I say but yet oh I'm
[39:34] saved
[39:35] I believe I'm saying huh well like I've
[39:39] always told you from the day I accepted
[39:44] Jesus Christ as my savior till this day
[39:47] and that was five years five five years
[39:56] in the Baptist Church and been now fifty
[39:59] years in this message
[40:02] I never let a day go by that I don't
[40:06] thank him for saving me that I don't ask
[40:10] him to save me well I asked him long
[40:16] time ago died believe it that's God I
[40:19] drove down the straight amen
[40:21] I did too but you're not listening to
[40:24] what I'm saying I'm thanking him for
[40:27] saving me
[40:28] and I'm wanting him to explain to me I
[40:33] am saved well god dude believe it
[40:38] now according to the Bible it's still in
[40:43] the scriptures at home brother Herman
[40:44] Garland you say I'll get tickled at it
[40:46] he'd say it's in the Bible called I read
[40:48] it this morning
[40:49] you know it's in the Bible that the
[40:51] devil believes in God and trembles if
[41:00] you ever believed in God enough to
[41:01] tremble you know gets nervous and all
[41:06] perplexed the devil does but is he saved
[41:12] no well you're trying to destroy my
[41:20] salvation but what by telling you that
[41:26] you need Jesus Christ as your Savior I
[41:32] said something one time in the church
[41:34] and brother got offended at me about it
[41:37] and I I asked him what he said and he
[41:38] said you said so and so and I said well
[41:41] what's that problem
[41:42] he said you got my people to seek in God
[41:44] I said I apologize to you for saying
[41:47] something to your church that you didn't
[41:49] believe but I'll never apologize for
[41:52] trying to get people to seek God I said
[41:56] till the day I die I'll be seeking God
[41:58] to have something to where he can do and
[42:03] sing great marvelous things from the
[42:06] dead raised to everything else but yet
[42:10] still ain't basing it upon that because
[42:13] you putting those things on some form of
[42:15] a sin
[42:16] sation or a thought the Prophet said the
[42:22] baptism of the holy ghost without a
[42:23] sensation but he never said the baptism
[42:27] when the holy ghost without an
[42:28] experience you've got to have an
[42:31] experience have you had the experience
[42:36] of the new birth well I'll just I'll
[42:44] just believe the message so does the
[42:49] devil and I'm honest and sincere about
[42:54] it I I never have understood one of the
[42:56] people of the world couldn't under
[42:57] couldn't believe this message I don't
[42:59] understand that the simplicity of the
[43:04] gospel expressed by a seventh grade
[43:07] educated man
[43:08] to explain salvation explained the
[43:11] things to us and why people can't
[43:14] understand the simplicity how much more
[43:23] simple could it be made than what it was
[43:25] made into our hands and what about it
[43:35] God sewed down the word into your heart
[43:39] that brings a conviction to you and you
[43:45] realize you need to be saved and you
[43:49] accept Jesus Christ as your Savior but
[43:53] then why do you stop and not continue on
[44:02] they don't they make you that much more
[44:04] sense here that are to make you that
[44:06] much more cry out to God I don't
[44:10] understand that why that you could get
[44:12] so you can get in God I don't believe
[44:14] you could ever get enough in God to
[44:16] where you got where you didn't want more
[44:18] come on do you think so you think you
[44:22] could ever get so much of God that you
[44:24] don't want no more of God they something
[44:26] wrong with your mentality let alone
[44:28] anything else
[44:29] any no revelation whatsoever involved
[44:32] you sure a dummy in your head sorry but
[44:35] that's as blunt as I can make it but you
[44:39] see Church
[44:42] do you realize ever born again believer
[44:46] now listen to this ever born again
[44:49] believer in the world is born the same
[44:54] ever natural baby natural born baby and
[45:02] we're not talking about the Syrians
[45:04] we're not talking about accidents
[45:06] happening we're talking about normal
[45:08] babies all normal babies are born the
[45:14] same right water blood and life right
[45:22] and that constitutes the natural birth
[45:26] within the spiritual birth ever
[45:29] born-again believer has the sign yeah
[45:31] but then people done something we didn't
[45:33] do that I didn't speak in tongues and
[45:36] then people spoke in tongues well what's
[45:39] that got to do with it you're making
[45:45] some form or something you do or don't
[45:47] do instead of accepting Jesus Christ as
[45:53] your Savior and letting him then through
[45:57] the opening of the word bring you to a
[45:58] place that he can accept you well I
[46:04] didn't know he had to accept me well
[46:06] what kind of salvation of you God is it
[46:10] based on this because you accept him the
[46:15] Bible said how can they call on him who
[46:17] they have not heard all right can I go
[46:21] with the rest of that and how can they
[46:23] hear without a preacher and you know
[46:25] preacher told me how to be saved I just
[46:27] accepted Jesus Christ
[46:35] no not to be a preacher to be mom and
[46:37] dad to be anybody right faith comes by
[46:40] hearing right how can we hear unless
[46:44] somebody teach us all right but see then
[46:50] ever born-again believer is born the
[46:53] same I don't care what happens you've
[46:59] got to go through now you're a prophet
[47:01] isn't one express these things he said
[47:04] the new birth consists of justification
[47:07] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[47:09] Ghost go to the message of birth playing
[47:11] I'm looking at it you've got to go
[47:15] through those three stages just as a
[47:17] natural baby goes through the three
[47:20] stages to get the natural baby here then
[47:24] it cries then it's outs then it speaks
[47:26] in tongues then it had a great time
[47:27] right the spiritual birth is repentance
[47:35] and asking Jesus Christ to save us
[47:38] forgive me of my sins and he watched
[47:42] those sins away then he begins to you
[47:46] know you want to go to church you want
[47:48] to do good and everything and through
[47:50] the opening of the word it keeps driving
[47:51] out those things until the Bible speaks
[47:55] of that unclean spirit driven out of you
[48:00] but now you know yourself now right
[48:03] there's the danger right it'd be nice to
[48:06] have the unclean spirit driven out right
[48:10] but that ain't the nuber I'm in the
[48:15] Bible where you at cause according to my
[48:18] Bible the unclean spirit goes out of a
[48:21] man
[48:21] walketh in dry places to seek his rest
[48:23] and find us none but he comes back to
[48:26] the house and finds it now I'm quoting
[48:27] you Bible it comes back and finds a
[48:30] house wept and that's Jesus explaining
[48:33] it and said he comes back in and said to
[48:37] work the person is worse than seven
[48:39] times state come on dieter Church ask me
[48:43] where it's that will find that scripture
[48:44] but that's in the gospel that he's
[48:46] explaining it
[48:49] see because that unclean spirit went out
[48:51] because you getting you desires and you
[48:53] thoughts and ideas that doesn't mean
[48:55] you're saved
[48:56] that means you started in the right
[48:58] direction we see then the baptism of the
[49:04] Holy Ghost comes into the living you
[49:06] which is the person of Jesus Christ
[49:08] coming to live in you and as he does
[49:11] there's the new birth and see what
[49:17] started over here is finished as the
[49:23] natural baby starts in the wound of the
[49:25] mother and then one day is finished by
[49:28] the fact that it is a
[49:29] exited out of the wound to bring it to
[49:33] natural life
[49:34] so is this spiritual birth in Christ
[49:38] well I never heard nobody preach about a
[49:40] new birth like that we just we just all
[49:42] we have to do is just shake hands
[49:45] well alright that's enough for you then
[49:53] they start shaking hands with people and
[49:55] saying I'm saved but you see I want
[50:00] something that'll keep me right did you
[50:07] keep your religion brother branham when
[50:09] you lost your wife and your son or your
[50:11] daughter no did it kept me that's why
[50:18] people you find them scraps he playing
[50:20] along the way that's in statue of a
[50:23] perfect man a blasphemy is not one scrap
[50:26] piece of ministers and Christians laying
[50:29] along the way why because they didn't
[50:32] get something to hold them they got
[50:35] something to try to hold on to but when
[50:37] the cares of life that's what Jesus was
[50:39] doing in the parables explaining it you
[50:42] know the cares of life and this this and
[50:44] that in the other involving on the
[50:46] stones and all you've read your Bible
[50:47] you're to be at least understand he was
[50:50] explaining what would take place to
[50:51] individuals how that when it did come
[50:54] down to life that we would either be
[50:57] holding on long enough for him to give
[50:59] us eternal life or we go back to the
[51:01] thing
[51:02] we come from it's alright to accept
[51:10] Jesus Christ we've got to do that but
[51:12] has he accepted you the disciples
[51:20] three and a half years accepted Jesus
[51:22] huh but you know what to come back when
[51:25] then you know what was left you remember
[51:28] there were 70 of them they walked away
[51:31] because they couldn't follow it you
[51:33] remember that in the gospel they walked
[51:37] away because they couldn't do it what
[51:39] happened to them the church you see what
[51:43] I'm trying to get you to see ever new
[51:46] birth is the new birth and it's a sign
[51:48] forever individual you must come through
[51:50] repentance of your sins accepting Jesus
[51:53] Christ as your Savior letting God do you
[51:56] in through the word that you read and
[51:58] study and pray let it cleanse you and
[52:01] and get rid of a lot of those desires
[52:03] and the thoughts that you had wrong and
[52:06] all that's well and good and give you
[52:08] new desires you want to go to church you
[52:10] want to be good you want to do all the
[52:12] things but then his own life has to come
[52:17] and live in you partial birth of the
[52:22] word it's the words you've took inhaled
[52:26] then it sets you to a place then of what
[52:31] and see that's where did I get into
[52:33] trouble trying to express it I wouldn't
[52:36] the one that said it your prophet said
[52:39] it's the Holy Ghost in every age the
[52:41] Holy Ghost was not eat down during the
[52:43] dark ages it was the word that was eat
[52:46] down the Holy Ghost was the same in
[52:49] every church age now come on
[52:51] as I said you read in in in the starting
[52:56] in chapter 2 of Revelations and you read
[52:59] these church age there's not a church
[53:01] age in there that it says anything is
[53:03] about tongues
[53:09] it doesn't say in the Bible you know
[53:12] that it's tongues as we make it he that
[53:18] hath atonement huh huh
[53:19] he that hath an ear effort church age
[53:22] read it yourself ever church age out of
[53:25] the seven each one of them had said he
[53:27] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[53:30] spirit saith unto the churches the
[53:32] evidence has always been the same in
[53:36] every Church age the evidence is the
[53:38] same in every church age the new birth
[53:41] is the same you don't have a new birth
[53:45] over here for this age and then one over
[53:47] here differ for this see that's man's
[53:53] ideas and his thoughts and concepts that
[53:57] have blinded the eyes of the people it's
[53:59] always been in the hearing on the day of
[54:04] Pentecost it didn't say they were all
[54:05] speaking in tongues of the same life he
[54:08] said how here we ever man in our own
[54:10] tongue wherein we are borned the secret
[54:16] has always been in the hearing because
[54:18] there's your evidence of the Holy Ghost
[54:20] whether or not the spirit in you agrees
[54:23] with the word or not right
[54:30] come on did the Prophet even himself God
[54:35] had to straighten him out because he
[54:37] believed that it was love he had
[54:39] believed many things of the evidence and
[54:42] God came to him in a dream and
[54:45] straightened him out and showed him that
[54:47] it was to believe the word it's always
[54:50] been in the hearing the secret that's
[54:53] what happened on the day of Pentecost
[54:55] read your Bible there's eight or ten
[54:57] different nations involved are it names
[54:59] them from this nation this nation is
[55:02] nice people will gather for every where
[55:04] and Peter was standing up talking and
[55:08] they said how here we ever man in her
[55:10] own tongue of course we could Baptist we
[55:12] had it all figured out we had the twelve
[55:17] standing there Peter talkin we had
[55:20] eleven interpreters
[55:23] you never heard down we had eleven
[55:27] interpreters to explain to the people
[55:30] around there what Peter was saying well
[55:32] that sounds good that ain't what the
[55:35] Bible say it the Bible said how hear we
[55:37] every man in our own tongue wherein we
[55:40] were born the evidence has always been
[55:46] in the hearing and it's always been the
[55:51] Holy Ghost in every age it's not the
[55:54] Holy Ghost in one agent in something
[55:56] else in another age it's the Holy Ghost
[55:59] in every age
[56:03] why because it's the birth of the word
[56:05] which is Christ is the birth of the word
[56:07] what's birth within you is Christ Paul
[56:12] said is not I that liveth but Christ
[56:14] liveth in me and the life that I now
[56:16] live in this flesh I live by the faith
[56:19] of the Son of God he was telling you
[56:23] what the birth was Peter tells you them
[56:27] of like precious faith that we just read
[56:31] the Bible is not written then listen
[56:34] I've tried to explain it and if you look
[56:35] at all the Bible's not written to a
[56:38] sinner the only thing a sinner can do by
[56:44] reading the Bible is to realize he's
[56:48] lost but he can do the same thing by
[56:50] reading your life if you're living it in
[56:52] front of them if you're living a
[56:54] Christian life in front of him he'd be
[56:56] more condemned by your life that you're
[56:57] living than he would be if you read the
[56:59] Bible himself right see God wants living
[57:07] Bibles people to walk and carry the word
[57:11] then the world can be condemned by but
[57:15] they're they're not condemned it's
[57:18] because they read the letters on the
[57:19] page oh that was like somebody wrote all
[57:25] right God laid down the word and the
[57:32] holy spirit quickened it on the day of
[57:34] Pentecost and they came forth with the
[57:36] new bird
[57:39] whatever happened there has to happen to
[57:41] ever age ever time ever person ever been
[57:47] well my mom and dad did they got it this
[57:50] way and I got it this way
[57:51] now if something's wrong what you got
[57:53] somebody didn't get what was goes to be
[57:56] got in the right place because as I said
[57:59] to start with what was it ever natural
[58:02] baby never natural baby they no
[58:06] shortcuts come on sisters you ought to
[58:08] be saying hey glory I remember that I
[58:11] know I'll like that they need no
[58:12] shortcuts in the natural birth water
[58:18] breaks it would have been at my house
[58:21] when water broke with one of the kids
[58:25] and I was trying my best to get my wife
[58:28] to go get in the car to go to the dock
[58:29] to the hospital her water had broke
[58:34] every time she'd walk across the floor
[58:36] to go to the bathroom I had to clean up
[58:38] the floor because she said we ain't
[58:39] leaving until you mop this floor I said
[58:42] at least go sat down find your place and
[58:46] sat down
[58:48] I'll get the house cleaned up we'll go
[58:53] but it always is water breaks then blood
[58:57] then laughs well why can't we realize
[59:00] the new birth the new birth is
[59:03] justification repenting of your sins
[59:06] asking God to forgive you accepting him
[59:09] as your Savior sanctification is him
[59:12] coming and through a work of the word
[59:14] that you're taking and reading and study
[59:17] he's cleansing you inwardly not your
[59:21] body in your spirit he's cleansing the
[59:23] soul he's driving out that unclean and
[59:29] when he gets that drove out then he can
[59:31] come in but it's the opening of the word
[59:34] that drives that out we're going to find
[59:38] out eventually that the seals has got to
[59:40] break to individuals to bring them up
[59:42] statue a perfect Mansell that's where
[59:46] I'm headed but listen
[59:50] see it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[59:52] personally to you he's dealing with you
[59:58] he's not dealing with somebody else so
[1:00:01] that new birth is the birth of the word
[1:00:04] that you've heard in the natural story
[1:00:12] there is no way to carry the seed except
[1:00:14] in the body of the male right come on in
[1:00:21] the body of the male is the natural seed
[1:00:23] and that's the way it is in the
[1:00:26] spiritual reproduction someone must tell
[1:00:29] you someone must teach you someone must
[1:00:32] speak to you about God in his ways and
[1:00:35] all that's well and good when you tell
[1:00:37] them you need to be saved you tell the
[1:00:39] children you need to be saved you need
[1:00:41] to come to order
[1:00:42] all that's well and good see you think
[1:00:44] I'm trying to do away with things I'm
[1:00:47] trying to show you you were doing things
[1:00:49] right but yet don't stop I have never
[1:00:55] told anybody I think you've got the Holy
[1:00:58] Ghost because it ain't none of my
[1:01:01] business for number one
[1:01:05] and for number two I'd be taking God's
[1:01:08] place and then gonna do it I'm going to
[1:01:13] tell you never stop seeking God and if
[1:01:16] you stop seeking God anywhere in your
[1:01:18] Christian experience then there's one
[1:01:20] thing for certain you didn't have it
[1:01:21] right to start with is that plain enough
[1:01:25] you didn't have it right to start with
[1:01:27] if you stopped you don't believe in
[1:01:30] backsliding I don't believe in being
[1:01:32] lost I don't believe in saved today and
[1:01:37] lost tomorrow I don't believe that all
[1:01:42] right but you see that birth of the word
[1:01:46] causes it it's the same as the natural
[1:01:48] birth and it constitutes the new birth
[1:01:54] and listen we read that Peter was saying
[1:01:58] here that this message he was bringing
[1:02:00] was addressed to those of like precious
[1:02:03] faith as I said while ago then you you
[1:02:07] can't bring it you you can't say well my
[1:02:13] baby I talked to my baby before it got
[1:02:16] here now I understand I'm not lost
[1:02:20] understand and believe things but I
[1:02:22] don't believe that baby as it's in our
[1:02:25] listening is talking back to you you
[1:02:30] know I don't get it that away you know
[1:02:32] people to say well you can you can hear
[1:02:35] your voices yeah they can hear your
[1:02:37] voices but they they don't know what
[1:02:38] words you use oh you don't
[1:02:42] well now you tell me how come a Chinese
[1:02:44] baby as quick as it's born it don't
[1:02:47] speak Chinese you know that every baby
[1:02:50] that's ever born naturally speaks the
[1:02:52] same language oh you ever had a baby it
[1:03:00] was morning start speaking Chinese and
[1:03:01] nobody in the family spoke Chinese now
[1:03:04] get out of it that's what I try to do I
[1:03:06] try to make it so carnal until our
[1:03:09] carnality shows up there's no such thing
[1:03:14] the baby learns from what he hears he
[1:03:17] don't come out of the wound speaking
[1:03:19] Chinese it comes out of the word
[1:03:21] speaking crazy so that's all they can do
[1:03:25] is cry but it gets your huh listen Peter
[1:03:33] said that he was addressing this message
[1:03:38] to those of like precious faith all
[1:03:43] right addressing it to people that had
[1:03:49] the new birth that he had because they
[1:03:52] were the only ones that could understand
[1:03:53] like precious faith so it's addressed to
[1:03:59] the church it's not addressed to the
[1:04:02] world I'm looking at those quotes you
[1:04:04] supposed to been agreed in one statue a
[1:04:05] perfect man
[1:04:06] so you'd order go through it he's
[1:04:07] addressing this to the church that's why
[1:04:10] we're here this morning is to find out
[1:04:12] what is the way what is God's
[1:04:16] requirement
[1:04:20] what is God's requirement he requires
[1:04:24] these virtues because he spoke of them
[1:04:26] now come on that's I've been over it and
[1:04:29] over it one more time
[1:04:33] 120 in the upper room two two three and
[1:04:35] a half years got the Holy Ghost they
[1:04:39] didn't just get it down here at the
[1:04:41] bottom they got it up here where it says
[1:04:44] brotherly kindness and Holy Spirit and
[1:04:47] that's called a faith of the Father but
[1:04:52] 3,000 outside never heard but one
[1:04:55] message
[1:04:56] how so canoeists were they heard one
[1:04:59] message and they received the new birth
[1:05:04] eternal life just like the rest of them
[1:05:06] but what did it make them how time to
[1:05:10] get to it but what did it make them what
[1:05:13] did it put them to be we're good let's
[1:05:15] get it this evenin cuz every baby is
[1:05:21] born to Nashville baby ever spiritual
[1:05:24] baby is born a spiritual baby
[1:05:27] we're babes in Christ desiring the
[1:05:31] sincere milk of the word that we may
[1:05:32] grow thereby that's what Peter was
[1:05:35] explaining how to get to her he was
[1:05:42] because when he received the Holy Ghost
[1:05:44] it put him at a higher position than it
[1:05:48] did those outside but ever baby born
[1:05:51] since that time there's no such thing as
[1:05:55] a baby born since that time being born
[1:05:58] like the apostles were you've got to be
[1:06:02] born as a baby right you born as a baby
[1:06:07] you desire the middle I mean you desire
[1:06:10] them to eat meat but you've got how milk
[1:06:13] you got to grow you've got to have it in
[1:06:16] there we'll get this evening scriptures
[1:06:17] and going with it
[1:06:18] right but see church Peter was telling
[1:06:24] them you that are sitting there
[1:06:27] listening to me he said you've received
[1:06:30] Jesus Christ
[1:06:31] your savior you have the new birth you
[1:06:33] have eternal life in your soul and
[1:06:35] that's who I'm addressing this to cause
[1:06:37] we remember now according to my Bible I
[1:06:40] think it's still left in there that no
[1:06:42] man can call Jesus Christ
[1:06:43] what come on no man can call Jesus
[1:06:48] Christ except it be by the Holy Ghost
[1:06:50] because you're saying what somebody else
[1:06:51] says right is that scriptural all right
[1:06:55] no man can call Jesus Christ except it
[1:06:57] be by the Holy Ghost himself all right
[1:07:00] so the only way you can be of like
[1:07:02] precious faith is to have the baptism
[1:07:04] when the Holy Ghost and that's what
[1:07:07] Peter's saying then he goes on to talk
[1:07:11] about these great things that have you
[1:07:15] with how you have escaped the corruption
[1:07:18] that is in the world through Jesus
[1:07:20] Christ
[1:07:22] Peter's explaining to those you're born
[1:07:25] again you have eternal life that said
[1:07:30] you need more then we used to have a
[1:07:35] little thing on the wall at the house
[1:07:36] and you could go look at the kids and it
[1:07:38] had he's a babe you know had weighed
[1:07:41] Terrance and Anna all right
[1:07:43] it started off weight as a baby a little
[1:07:46] baby
[1:07:46] Terrance a little baby and I was a
[1:07:49] little baby
[1:07:49] we know I'm honest they got about ten
[1:07:52] years older piece than their in their
[1:07:54] days and you know what you say well boy
[1:07:57] I always said just stay right there you
[1:07:59] know you you're thinking about how great
[1:08:02] it was for them right during that period
[1:08:04] of time and you say wouldn't it be
[1:08:06] something they just stayed that age you
[1:08:08] know they were so mellow so sweet so
[1:08:10] nice everything was good they were this
[1:08:13] little kids right but that don't work
[1:08:20] why is it that don't work how do they
[1:08:22] grow up right and then you see them go
[1:08:26] across the wall as they get older and
[1:08:28] older and you told me there's where it
[1:08:30] was wait at 13 look at him at 14 that
[1:08:34] Ohio trying to slim down he'd sneak
[1:08:36] around let it out a little bit you know
[1:08:38] ain't gonna get into Terrence and Anna
[1:08:41] Wade's not here
[1:08:46] right do you know what I'm talking about
[1:08:51] they growed up we don't want to finish
[1:08:54] up all over these then after it's done
[1:08:57] you wouldn't want them to stay young
[1:08:59] after a while I begin to see my wife's
[1:09:04] nature into the children
[1:09:07] I don't know trouble see in mind there's
[1:09:09] mean enough okay you get that one
[1:09:12] I don't trouble seeing my nature and the
[1:09:14] kids there's mean enough but I could see
[1:09:17] the mother's nature to raise the
[1:09:18] children cuz she raised him you know I
[1:09:21] don't know not co-working gentle motor
[1:09:24] and she took him places they had to
[1:09:26] depend on her she's one that raised him
[1:09:29] I've done a good job all right what you
[1:09:33] see they finally growed up
[1:09:38] you know after a while you begin to
[1:09:41] realize now think about God that's what
[1:09:45] I'm trying to explain think about after
[1:09:48] a while you that well now look what they
[1:09:51] developed into now right there they got
[1:09:55] a job they went to work they started
[1:09:57] doing things you know and they quit
[1:10:00] acting like babies and started trying to
[1:10:02] grow up right you could see yourself
[1:10:06] well they're not the way God wants to do
[1:10:09] it I mean what is the what is the
[1:10:11] purpose as we as in Christ's ministry
[1:10:13] what's the purpose of every Christian
[1:10:17] what is the purpose of every Christian
[1:10:20] apart the the whole fact of Christianity
[1:10:23] is based upon faith in God we know those
[1:10:25] things we do you realize what it is to
[1:10:27] be a Christian that you want your nature
[1:10:31] to be displayed in your children right
[1:10:37] I've told you before about it there was
[1:10:39] a friend of ours that he was a run a
[1:10:42] bank you know he was a banker and he
[1:10:45] told me one day he said Sam said
[1:10:47] whatever you're doing said y'all raised
[1:10:49] a good bunch of kids well you know that
[1:10:52] was something I mean if I'd have seen an
[1:10:55] old mean drunk out learn he said that I
[1:10:56] could listen
[1:10:57] to him a little bit and say was it okay
[1:10:59] they made any point but when the banker
[1:11:02] says your children have turned out good
[1:11:04] children see then you think a little
[1:11:06] better so then I spit it up you know but
[1:11:08] then I went back down because I realized
[1:11:10] I didn't do it my wife done it she was
[1:11:13] when it raised him so it was her nature
[1:11:15] that was instilled in doing cuz that's
[1:11:19] the way it was supposed to be okay come
[1:11:20] on listen but it's written to Peter is
[1:11:24] telling that church there are those
[1:11:27] people he's not writing to the world now
[1:11:31] listen carefully second first Peter is
[1:11:35] to talk to you about your needing to get
[1:11:38] born again and think second Peter he's
[1:11:42] telling you how to get to where he was
[1:11:46] and the way he had come are you
[1:11:49] listening
[1:11:50] read your Bible second Peter is telling
[1:11:53] you how to come to where he was Peter in
[1:11:57] that gospel of what God wanted for
[1:12:03] mankind to be like and he says I'm
[1:12:07] writing them to this to those of like
[1:12:09] precious right I'm writing it to the
[1:12:11] church those that are in Christ Jesus to
[1:12:16] try to get the church to realize what
[1:12:18] they need and the kamon you folks have
[1:12:20] been reading the message what did he get
[1:12:21] into talk about how to build a
[1:12:23] tabernacle he said what is God's
[1:12:26] tabernacle he said God's tabernacle is
[1:12:28] not buildings and houses and churches
[1:12:30] and things like that
[1:12:32] God's tabernacle is building you you are
[1:12:35] god's tabernacle you're the one to carry
[1:12:38] God to the world that they can see
[1:12:39] Christ all right and see by one spirit
[1:12:45] then the scripture says that we're all
[1:12:48] baptized into one body now listen well
[1:12:54] ago you may have sent us load back when
[1:12:56] I said never born-again believers born
[1:12:58] to same evidence the Holy Ghost is the
[1:13:03] same for everybody
[1:13:05] [Music]
[1:13:06] now can you see that scripture in
[1:13:10] Corinthians 12 by one spirit we're all
[1:13:14] baptized into one body same way now come
[1:13:25] on
[1:13:25] did the Prophet explain it like this
[1:13:28] that if God ever done anything the first
[1:13:31] time he done it he done it the way that
[1:13:33] he wanted to do it and he never changed
[1:13:36] from that is that true so then the first
[1:13:40] baby that was born every baby's gonna be
[1:13:47] born it's why it's been all of that time
[1:13:51] back there with Adam you remember that
[1:13:54] that Adam God gave out of eternal life
[1:13:57] in his soul and that was his example son
[1:14:00] was Adam Adam never lost his eternal
[1:14:05] life in his soul but he lost possession
[1:14:07] of the world and all of the things that
[1:14:09] related around there he never lost it
[1:14:11] eternal life the second Adam came the
[1:14:17] first Adam had imparted eternal life
[1:14:19] into his soul the second Adam didn't
[1:14:21] have impartation of eternal life into
[1:14:24] this so he was the very soul himself the
[1:14:29] Lord Jesus Christ was Almighty God
[1:14:31] himself come down in human flesh to
[1:14:33] dwell with us to here upon earth would
[1:14:36] never remember then he started on the
[1:14:39] day of Pentecost right
[1:14:42] he started his church on the day of
[1:14:45] Pentecost with the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:47] Ghost the new birth eternal life the
[1:14:53] growth development of the Apostles there
[1:14:55] is Paul that on the backside of the
[1:14:57] desert comes out of there preaching
[1:14:58] adoption same thing Peter was preaching
[1:15:02] in 2nd Peter the growth development of a
[1:15:05] child was adoption you born into the
[1:15:08] family you've your child when you're
[1:15:10] born which you growth development brings
[1:15:12] you to superiorities and things of your
[1:15:15] father to where he can trust you
[1:15:17] that's the statue of a perfect man
[1:15:19] all of its a saying to bring it to the
[1:15:22] position that God can use you and have
[1:15:26] you as a son of God like Adam was the
[1:15:29] son of God like Jesus was the son of God
[1:15:31] like the early church was the son of God
[1:15:34] coming forth our God in human flesh it
[1:15:38] was not the spirit that was eaten down
[1:15:39] in the Dark Ages it was the word the
[1:15:45] word was what was ate down and the word
[1:15:47] had to start back in Luther the just
[1:15:49] shall live by faith then it had to come
[1:15:51] to Wesley of sanctification that's why
[1:15:54] we believe in all of those churches out
[1:15:56] there that they think we don't believe
[1:15:57] in you think maybe we don't believe in
[1:16:00] those churches
[1:16:01] I believe we're anchored on what Martin
[1:16:04] Luther taught her the just shall live by
[1:16:06] faith when Luther come out of that
[1:16:10] Catholic Church I came out because the
[1:16:13] just shall live by faith
[1:16:15] I believe in the just shall live by
[1:16:17] faith John Wesley preached
[1:16:19] sanctification I believe in that the
[1:16:22] Pentecost were preached the baptism of
[1:16:24] the holy goat and speaking in tongues
[1:16:25] and shout I believe in every bit of that
[1:16:29] but see then the message of the hour
[1:16:32] came to restore what was eating away to
[1:16:39] bring you back to the faith of the
[1:16:41] Father Peter was telling them sin that
[1:16:44] listen this is the way you come to work
[1:16:46] that God wants you to come you add to
[1:16:51] your faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:16:55] patience godliness until you come back
[1:16:58] to where we're standing
[1:17:00] because remember wouldn't it be
[1:17:02] something wouldn't it be something
[1:17:05] that's like I said nothing that wouldn't
[1:17:07] be something for us to say okay now
[1:17:08] tomorrow twelve o'clock
[1:17:10] we're gonna meet over Don's garage in
[1:17:13] and I'm gonna tear a motor apart and put
[1:17:16] it back together and show y'all how it's
[1:17:18] done well I think you got enough
[1:17:23] confidence to know I can get it apart
[1:17:27] right
[1:17:29] but I can't put it back together he's
[1:17:33] gonna take somebody that has experienced
[1:17:35] diet to put it back together easy to
[1:17:38] take it apart right well sister-in-law
[1:17:44] if she could never make a dress she just
[1:17:47] couldn't do it
[1:17:48] my brother he learned how to make
[1:17:50] dresses
[1:17:51] I remember my brother's a Methodist
[1:17:53] preacher he'd make up her dresses and
[1:17:55] things for one because he learned how to
[1:17:58] do it Peter was standing there sayin
[1:18:03] listen that today I got born again all
[1:18:08] of these things were brought in to me
[1:18:09] too right here and he said now you got
[1:18:12] born again down here in your faith and
[1:18:15] you need to grow up where I'm at and I'm
[1:18:18] trying to tell you how to do it he was
[1:18:20] the teacher he was the college graduate
[1:18:22] would it be something to walk into a
[1:18:24] thing let's see sterling got a 400 on
[1:18:28] his and what it was and college thing
[1:18:32] 400 right I mean if I understanding
[1:18:39] that's the best you can get well you
[1:18:42] know that's what I got the only problem
[1:18:49] is they put a decimal in front of my 4
[1:18:57] so I had decimal 400 right you
[1:19:04] understand what I'm trying to say don't
[1:19:07] put a novice God didn't put a novice to
[1:19:09] write his word he never took a novice to
[1:19:13] write his word he used only those who
[1:19:17] were tutored and trying we'll get to it
[1:19:20] eventually when he gets over in
[1:19:21] Galatians he said he gave gifts he gave
[1:19:24] some apostles some prophets some
[1:19:26] evangelists some pastors some teachers
[1:19:28] for the perfecting of the Saints to the
[1:19:32] edifying of the body of Christ until we
[1:19:34] all come to the stature read your Bible
[1:19:40] you know that's one scripture brother
[1:19:42] around there
[1:19:43] using such a perfect man and why I don't
[1:19:44] know he never talked to that stature of
[1:19:50] that scripture that was the only
[1:19:51] scripture that has this word stature in
[1:19:53] it the stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:19:59] Peter said we've reached his place I
[1:20:03] won't try to teach you how to follow me
[1:20:07] brother branham come along he said Lord
[1:20:09] should fill me up with these things
[1:20:12] fill me up Lord with these things that I
[1:20:15] make teach others apostles prophets you
[1:20:19] read stature perfectly what do you say
[1:20:21] that I meet each other it's a possible
[1:20:23] profit advantage of pastoring these for
[1:20:25] the perfecting of the Saints the
[1:20:27] edifying of the body of Christ right he
[1:20:35] told us what God wanted us to hear Peter
[1:20:40] is trying to say okay now you just don't
[1:20:43] jump up brother MOCA had to a great way
[1:20:45] of come come on musicians well the
[1:20:47] moment out of West expressing things it
[1:20:49] was good he said now the way we do it he
[1:20:51] said we look at tall and said we run
[1:20:54] over to a ladder and said we just jump
[1:20:55] up about four wrongs and take off the
[1:20:57] last brother high all he was coming down
[1:20:59] one of them and he decided he didn't
[1:21:01] need to make them last couple of steps
[1:21:04] he just stepped off the ladder
[1:21:07] well they he'd done that I've done it a
[1:21:09] minute I hadn't you but he didn't
[1:21:11] realize it was a log laying there that
[1:21:14] his foot hit and he twisted it and he's
[1:21:17] had a gerbil all his life see Church we
[1:21:23] need growth development in Christ growth
[1:21:27] development is the hardest thing to try
[1:21:30] to talk about I wasn't the one that said
[1:21:34] it we will get to those thing where the
[1:21:37] Prophet said that those seven thunders
[1:21:39] of the revelation contained in the seven
[1:21:41] seals 327 church age we'll read it this
[1:21:44] messenger melikhaya for Luke seventeen
[1:21:46] thirty or revelation to himself he said
[1:21:48] he'd do two things one turned the hearts
[1:21:50] of the children back to the faith of the
[1:21:51] Father to you reveal the thunders which
[1:21:54] is a revelation contained in the seven
[1:21:56] seals and it
[1:21:57] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[1:21:58] that literally turn earth back so then
[1:22:01] you want to be turned back to the faith
[1:22:02] of the Father the only way you can be
[1:22:06] turned back to the faith of the father's
[1:22:07] for the seals to be opening to you I
[1:22:09] don't need to understand to see you left
[1:22:11] if you know I don't deep stuff we don't
[1:22:13] need that we need to dish we need to get
[1:22:15] more and again that's what I just say it
[1:22:18] that was what I just say it I said the
[1:22:21] only way that we can stop being babies
[1:22:24] is to hear God's Word and let it unfold
[1:22:28] unto us to help us to grow up in Christ
[1:22:32] until we come to the stature of the
[1:22:34] fullness of Christ through the opening
[1:22:36] of the word through the opening of the
[1:22:40] seven seals is what your prophet said
[1:22:47] but it's just like I've said to you I've
[1:22:51] talked with preachers like seals Daniel
[1:22:57] seventy weeks we don't need to
[1:22:59] understand this come find out didn't
[1:23:01] even have a book come find out a lot of
[1:23:04] them ministers never even had a book and
[1:23:06] never read Daniel seventy weeks but they
[1:23:09] could tell you all about it never read
[1:23:12] the book I asked you a simple question
[1:23:17] how many of you have ever sat down and
[1:23:20] read to see a book I told you I don't
[1:23:28] want you to raise your hand because it
[1:23:29] shows up how many of you is really ever
[1:23:33] just sat down and read a single book we
[1:23:37] get you know all about it
[1:23:39] you evidently do because you don't need
[1:23:40] nobody to treat you if somebody comes
[1:23:45] along you trying to eat this we don't
[1:23:47] need these big things feed my sheep we
[1:23:50] don't need these deep things we just
[1:23:53] need to know how to get saved Church I'm
[1:23:59] sorry that my memory is too good but I
[1:24:05] remember it's either in the questions
[1:24:07] and answers are in the seventh seal but
[1:24:09] around us is going with
[1:24:10] I'm a simple message he said because if
[1:24:13] you don't you'll work yourself away from
[1:24:15] it everything that I've ever preached
[1:24:18] for 50 years from this pulpit Nord in
[1:24:22] 1971 will be close to 50 there's been
[1:24:27] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:24:31] of the Holy Ghost the new birth all I've
[1:24:36] ever preached is the new birth marriage
[1:24:40] and divorce is the new birth attached to
[1:24:44] a perfect man isn't and where the seals
[1:24:46] is a new birth Daniel 70 weeks is a new
[1:24:48] birth what else you want to go to it's
[1:24:51] all the new birth it's all being born
