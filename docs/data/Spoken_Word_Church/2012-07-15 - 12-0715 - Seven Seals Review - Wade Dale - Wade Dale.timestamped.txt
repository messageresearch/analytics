[0:00] this is the Lord's time not yours

[0:14] horse
[0:19] okay all right Revelation chapter six
[0:22] now good to see each and every one of
[0:24] you here this morning could have a temp
[0:28] count noon with us
[0:31] always good to have it and I'm gonna be
[0:35] back uh
[0:36] I don't want to talk about being in the
[0:38] Saddles don't talk about horse riders
[0:40] today so just good to be here
[0:42] I want everybody that enjoyed this man
[0:46] to give him a hand
[0:54] stuck bye that was the last time I just
[0:55] understood was February the 19th so time
[0:58] flies you know when you're having fun so
[0:59] I really enjoyed it got some real good
[1:02] things out of it
[1:03] got a couple of sermons working off of
[1:06] it so
[1:07] everybody can be helped sometimes we
[1:10] think we're really insignificant but
[1:12] like I told the ministers yesterday I
[1:13] Holy Ghost Bill woman brother Brown said
[1:15] can help you if you'll listen to her all
[1:17] right so Holy Ghost Bill woman will help
[1:19] you
[1:20] all right so let's go to chapter six now
[1:23] we had been studying on the Seven Seals
[1:28] we got to seal number four and we
[1:30] covered them pretty pretty thoroughly uh
[1:33] back in the first of the year and and
[1:35] back in like November and December
[1:38] but I want to kind of today is going to
[1:39] be a review of the first four
[1:41] then we're gonna go into five six and
[1:44] seven
[1:46] all right and then break it down each
[1:48] seal five six seven all right
[1:52] everybody understand that's where we're
[1:53] going so read
[1:55] the fifth Seal The Sixth Seal and the
[1:57] seventh seal but just if you want to
[1:58] just read the fifth seal or listen to
[2:00] the fifth seal tape that that brother
[2:03] Brown and preached and we're gonna break
[2:04] it down
[2:05] and
[2:07] show you that
[2:10] even though the Rapture takes place at
[2:12] the force deal the fifth sixth and
[2:14] seventh to me are one of the most
[2:16] important ones because it's for
[2:18] Redemption of this guy so we moved from
[2:20] one two three and four in the Redemption
[2:22] of the soul to where five six and seven
[2:25] is going to show you the Redemption of
[2:27] this thing okay this thing and this
[2:29] thing's the last thing is to be
[2:30] conquered is death of this
[2:32] all right if you're born again you don't
[2:34] have to worry about death
[2:35] you're born again in the soul you don't
[2:37] you'll never die
[2:38] but this guy right here is dying every
[2:40] day all right so that's the one we're
[2:42] looking at but we're gonna go through
[2:44] one two three and four today and maybe
[2:46] next Sunday just to make sure you have a
[2:48] background that September I mean uh
[2:50] February's been a long time
[2:51] and brother Bob's been on on lineages
[2:54] and things like that so we're just kind
[2:56] of we're going to try to bring you back
[2:57] to to what we were talking about several
[3:00] months ago
[3:02] um and remember too while I have most of
[3:05] you down here some of you that are
[3:06] signed up for the Dave Ramsey course it
[3:09] starts August the 5th at five o'clock so
[3:11] if you're not signed up and you're going
[3:13] to take it you need to put your name on
[3:15] the board which I think most everybody
[3:16] is signed up and some of you that are
[3:18] have already taken it
[3:19] encourage the ones that are not taking
[3:22] it
[3:23] to take it
[3:25] amen all right amen amen
[3:29] especially better than I was paying for
[3:31] the thing
[3:32] all right so it's free to you and that's
[3:34] a real big help because most people do
[3:36] that but it's an investment for him
[3:38] because you saw all the money that we
[3:40] saved
[3:42] you know the ninety one thousand dollars
[3:43] that with debt we paid off the Forty
[3:45] thousand dollars that y'all saved if
[3:47] we're able to save and then the 380 000
[3:49] we were able to
[3:51] avoid that much debt
[3:53] which is astronomical
[3:55] to avoid that much debt to avoid almost
[3:58] four hundred thousand dollars of debt
[4:00] that you would have had and you would
[4:02] have still had today
[4:04] had we not went to the 13-week class but
[4:07] the class is going to be nine weeks it's
[4:09] going to be an hour and a half instead
[4:10] of two I put five to seven because we
[4:12] may have a little more discussion June
[4:14] and I are going to go a little more into
[4:15] detail about what brother Brown said
[4:17] about money because up there we had some
[4:19] people that were not Believers now if we
[4:22] it's open to anybody that wants to come
[4:24] we have to open it or we have to do a
[4:26] copyright thing so we're open to anybody
[4:28] but it's mostly all the people in the
[4:30] church so we're going to teach some
[4:31] things that brother Reynolds said about
[4:32] about money and stuff too so we got to
[4:35] still live in the world we got to still
[4:37] have money
[4:39] money won't buy you low but it sure will
[4:41] make you a little bit happier
[4:42] all right
[4:44] so now let's go through this let's read
[4:45] chapter six
[4:49] of Revelation
[4:51] now Dad's getting ready to get into this
[4:53] so you you guys ought to be a man and
[4:55] you ought to be right there with him
[4:57] because you're going to be right in the
[4:58] channel you're gonna be furling down the
[5:00] same same line that he is and he gets
[5:02] out of chapter five he's going right
[5:03] into chapter six in Revelation chapter
[5:05] five is showing the opening of these
[5:07] sales and I want to reiterate one more
[5:09] thing
[5:11] John in chapter 5 John was a born-again
[5:14] Believer and was still crying for
[5:16] Redemption
[5:22] now it is okay
[5:24] so John was crying for a redeemer yet
[5:26] he'd been redeemed for 60 years and his
[5:28] soul he was looking for something else
[5:29] he was looking for
[5:31] the one to take this guy
[5:33] and redeem this guy so that's what we're
[5:36] moving from
[5:37] the first four seals showing the
[5:39] complete Plan of Redemption
[5:42] and then show the Redemption of this guy
[5:44] so I want to kind of keep that little
[5:45] seed into your mind and as Dad preaches
[5:48] up front and as we come down here let
[5:51] that seed cultivate because that's what
[5:52] he's talking about when he starts going
[5:54] through the seals the seals is the
[5:56] complete Plan of Redemption from one
[5:57] through seven is the complete plan of
[5:59] her dancing and and you'll hear quotes
[6:01] where six seals finishes Redemption with
[6:03] six seals finishes Redemption absolutely
[6:07] because the Sabbath is Christ showing
[6:09] you through all the other six the only
[6:11] one sealed to break and that's one the
[6:12] seventh seal and that's Christ because
[6:13] Jesus we prove to you that Jesus Freaks
[6:16] six seals because we read in the Bible
[6:17] in Matthew 24. all right that was just a
[6:19] revelation behind that that had not been
[6:21] that light had not been shining on them
[6:24] so let the first seal but you're going
[6:26] to take a few bullet points and talk
[6:27] about them this morning
[6:28] the first seal with the white horse
[6:30] rider right right he wrote out in
[6:32] opposition as a white righteous church
[6:35] he looked like
[6:38] God
[6:40] that's brother Brown preached and he was
[6:42] the Holy Ghost down Through the Ages
[6:43] riding Out Among the people right so it
[6:46] looked like a white righteous Church
[6:48] I said it looked like one
[6:51] and they started with sayings and then
[6:53] deeds and indoctrines but the saying we
[6:55] started a baby form of what that white
[6:57] righteous church but there had to be
[7:01] listen if the seals is a revelation to
[7:03] Jesus Christ
[7:04] there had to be a white righteous Church
[7:06] on
[7:07] Earth at that time
[7:09] for Satan to copy from
[7:12] that's right Satan doesn't ever do
[7:14] anything first
[7:15] never he can't he's not original he has
[7:18] no seed he has nothing to begin with so
[7:21] he has to follow behind or copy
[7:25] right what God's already done so God in
[7:28] the first church through the through the
[7:30] the lion l-i-o-n the lion
[7:33] you know the lion ox man and Eagle
[7:35] daddy's been thinking he finished that
[7:37] up you know in Revelation 4. but
[7:39] remember one thing and I don't think he
[7:41] brought it out I told him to mention
[7:42] that the other night I hadn't listened
[7:44] to Winston Wednesday night's tape yet
[7:45] but the lion oxman and Eagle always
[7:47] follows the bride because that is the
[7:49] characteristics of the Holy Ghost
[7:52] because when brother random gets to the
[7:53] fifth seal you're going to read and
[7:54] you're gonna you're gonna see where he
[7:56] says the bride's not on the earth
[7:57] because there's no more combat beat
[8:01] so the combat beast that's your whole
[8:04] that's the Holy Ghost
[8:06] that's the characteristics of the Holy
[8:08] Ghost the lion bold strong word Base Ops
[8:12] labor be patient with the people
[8:14] man intelligence the intelligence of God
[8:17] and then the eagle where we can see
[8:19] Revelation like nobody else has seen
[8:21] Revelation before all right so everybody
[8:23] understand that right yes that is the
[8:25] characteristics of the Holy Ghost
[8:27] anywhere you see lion oxman and Eagle
[8:29] you see the bride
[8:31] even in even in Ezekiel he just did not
[8:34] know what to call he called it Christ
[8:36] because really the wheel in the middle
[8:38] of the wheel is Christ where
[8:42] cut your body off and turn it up and it
[8:45] looks like a wheel and there's Christ in
[8:47] the middle of the wheel
[8:48] A Wheel in the middle of a wheel turning
[8:52] your new birth starts from the inside
[8:55] out Ezekiel just knew how to call it a
[8:58] wheel in the middle of the wheel because
[8:59] remember uh let me prove that brother
[9:01] Brown said Jesus Christ when he went to
[9:03] hell and preached to the Sinners
[9:04] remember he come back up through
[9:06] Paradise remember he knocked on the door
[9:08] he said Abraham opened the door and said
[9:10] look there there's the man that that we
[9:11] ate a calf with
[9:13] and he said Ezekiel said there's the
[9:15] willing
[9:18] he saw Christ but he didn't know what to
[9:20] call this great man that he was looking
[9:21] at so it was a wheel it was it was God
[9:24] helping Israel down through their
[9:25] Journey the ox carts rolling the wheel
[9:27] in the middle of the wheel but he was
[9:29] typing Jesus Christ but see you see
[9:32] where Jesus Christ is then therefore the
[9:33] bride is
[9:34] when you put them together in
[9:35] Revelations you see the bride the Bride
[9:38] of Jesus Christ the will here's the will
[9:42] and here's the wheel in the middle of
[9:43] the wheel which is Christ because
[9:45] actually the outside of the wheel
[9:46] doesn't turn anything
[9:52] it's the inside the Hub is what does the
[9:55] turning
[9:57] this is what's just rolling because this
[10:00] thing's got an axle through it and it's
[10:02] turning so it's God
[10:03] turning a group of people
[10:07] pretty simple when you look at the wheel
[10:08] in the middle of the wheel everybody
[10:09] want to go how do you
[10:11] have you just take cut your body in half
[10:16] either God or the devil one of the two
[10:19] then you've got
[10:20] faith
[10:22] virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[10:25] Godless brotherly comments and every one
[10:28] of them's a little pyramid in itself
[10:30] and there you are
[10:32] a complete man we'll see Ezekiel didn't
[10:33] know how to explain that
[10:35] he'd have a dry erase board
[10:38] you probably could draw in the sand
[10:41] but we know now that it's the wheel
[10:44] in the middle of the wheel
[10:46] turning God turning
[10:49] the Bride of Jesus Christ so that's what
[10:51] they said the lion knocks man and eagle
[10:54] is the characteristics of the Holy Ghost
[10:56] in the ages right so when brother around
[10:57] gets to the fifth seal he said the bride
[11:00] goes up in the fourth seal the Rapture
[11:02] takes place in the fourth seal because
[11:04] you don't see the combat beasts anymore
[11:07] everybody got there
[11:09] so now I'm saying amen amen that's what
[11:13] malachite
[11:15] that's right Malachi four he turned he
[11:17] turned the hearts of the children back
[11:18] to the father thank you brother Ray
[11:20] he'll be speaking that Sunday morning
[11:24] I told you one day you're gonna get up
[11:26] and say something
[11:34] he went up because when you see these
[11:37] gone the bride's gone but wherever you
[11:40] see that you see the bride all right
[11:42] everybody got that all right so
[11:46] the line would come out in the first age
[11:49] boldness Paul
[11:52] says if an angel comes from heaven and
[11:54] preaches any other gospel
[11:56] except what you heard from me let him be
[11:58] a curse that's pretty bold
[12:00] right in other words Paul said it ain't
[12:03] nowhere but right here right right it's
[12:06] nowhere but here that's right all right
[12:07] because he had a true revelation of what
[12:10] was going on in that time but like I
[12:12] told him yesterday we talked about Paul
[12:14] saying Grievous wolves have come Among
[12:16] Us
[12:17] but Paul says if you'll keep reading
[12:19] that scripture Paul says and they're
[12:21] already
[12:22] among you yeah working
[12:26] see the devil's got a
[12:28] same thing if that's the devil that's
[12:32] him turning you
[12:34] so he's copying after
[12:36] Christ and that's what it is with the
[12:38] the seals it's not the revelation of
[12:40] Satan
[12:42] brother Brown said he is those seals he
[12:44] went home at the Devil right he was
[12:46] talking about God God is the revelation
[12:48] of those seals Jesus Christ the full
[12:50] revelation of Jesus Christ is in those
[12:52] seals and that's what has been holding
[12:54] from all the other ages it's the full
[12:57] revelation of Jesus Christ because if
[12:59] Paul would have had a full Revelation to
[13:01] Jesus Christ if he would have had this
[13:03] Revelation they would have took a
[13:05] Rapture and they would have been nothing
[13:06] left
[13:07] but it's like brother Tim said the
[13:08] Eternal Word of God was talking about
[13:10] last night Psalm 7
[13:13] Church ages and there's no way
[13:16] that he could come in any of these ages
[13:18] except the last one
[13:20] because he saw the church ain't it he
[13:22] couldn't break his word so he had to
[13:24] bring the full Revelation over here in
[13:25] the seventh age it couldn't happen in
[13:27] the first couldn't happen in the second
[13:29] you know why it couldn't happen in those
[13:31] ages because I wasn't there
[13:34] well that wasn't there if you got to
[13:36] make this thing personal that's right
[13:38] right that's right like brother Brown
[13:40] said he said in 1963 when he was
[13:42] preaching the various seals he said it's
[13:43] gone from you people
[13:45] you're not even supposed to get it and
[13:47] listen on the tape they're shouting and
[13:49] screaming and praising God in Hallelujah
[13:50] well I wouldn't be
[13:52] I'd be going oh man what'd I miss
[13:55] he said it's not even for you go and
[13:57] live a good simple life he said but
[13:58] right around and coming to the Lord
[13:59] these things will be made known well
[14:00] this is right around the coming of the
[14:01] Lord I believe amen all right so Now's
[14:03] the Time to be made known see because
[14:05] you and I weren't there right there's a
[14:07] reason he said that
[14:09] because I wasn't sitting in the
[14:11] Tabernacle that day I believe that's why
[14:13] he had to say that because he started
[14:15] talking about the radio he said there's
[14:17] little diamond chips in the radio now
[14:18] that don't happen now but back then
[14:20] that's what happened
[14:21] it was receptors inside that radio there
[14:23] was little diamonds and when that lights
[14:25] or that uh radio wave hits that diamond
[14:28] at a certain angle that's where you get
[14:30] 55 megahertz 60 megahertz 750 megahertz
[14:33] that's why it's am 750.
[14:36] back then it was 750 megahertz well it
[14:38] created that many megahertz when that
[14:40] radio wave hit that diamond it created
[14:43] 750 megahertz it was cut a different way
[14:45] well
[14:46] mine wasn't in the radio
[14:49] not yet
[14:51] the radio he was looking at
[14:53] yeah he said because there's Angels
[14:55] going through this building but see we
[14:57] can pick them up
[15:00] we can pick them up now they couldn't
[15:02] pick him up back there
[15:03] because we have the right receptors here
[15:06] to receive they didn't have the right
[15:08] receptors not saying those people
[15:09] weren't born again not saying they
[15:11] didn't have the new birth they had the
[15:12] new birth for their time right right
[15:14] they live their life a good Christian
[15:16] Life and died and went by the grave and
[15:18] you know what they're waiting on you and
[15:19] I to bring them up
[15:21] all right so no discredit to the people
[15:22] that were sitting at the Tabernacle I
[15:24] don't think he said it I don't think he
[15:25] said the Holy Ghost has gone from you
[15:27] know they all a lot I've saved a lot of
[15:28] them had a new birth
[15:30] but they didn't have this Revelation
[15:31] that we're talking about right now all
[15:33] right and he said it's gone from you and
[15:35] it's not even for you well if he said
[15:37] it's not even for you then it must be
[15:38] for a group of people that it is for
[15:40] that's right okay he said it's not even
[15:42] for you right so it is for us though
[15:44] because we've come under the revelation
[15:46] of the total end time all right
[15:50] now remember 10 30 we got to go
[15:57] uh leaking ball
[16:07] the word up there is more important than
[16:09] the word down here
[16:11] all right white horse rider
[16:14] there was a white righteous church
[16:15] already on the earth in Paul's day
[16:18] before that white horse rider could ride
[16:20] off because he rode in opposition to the
[16:23] church that was there
[16:25] all right so there's got to be a church
[16:27] on the Earth
[16:29] for Satan to mirror or to copy after
[16:33] so there was a white righteous church
[16:34] already on the earth they were they were
[16:36] under the lion age all right which was
[16:40] age number one we're going to go ahead
[16:41] and put them in a church ages because we
[16:43] did when we did them
[16:45] um
[16:45] when we did the uh
[16:48] one through four so the church ages one
[16:51] two and three
[16:52] was the lion age
[16:55] all right it was a white righteous
[16:57] Church
[16:59] and it typed justification
[17:03] right because justification
[17:06] is true justification is you never did
[17:09] it right right but this is baby form
[17:13] justification you know you did it you're
[17:15] starting out as a Christian and God
[17:16] looks at you because the Bible says
[17:18] those who has Justified he has already
[17:20] glorified so if you're truly Justified
[17:22] this morning just in a Justified
[17:24] condition if just if last night you
[17:26] drank smoked and run around with a woman
[17:28] and last night about midnight
[17:31] God come down and said you need to
[17:33] repent and you truly repent and he knows
[17:37] whether you truly repented or not
[17:39] he doesn't give you the Holy Ghost he
[17:41] gives you a way to get to it right
[17:43] because justification is a work of the
[17:46] Holy Ghost what it is it's the Holy
[17:47] Ghost calling you
[17:49] in a baby form you may still have those
[17:52] desires remember
[17:54] you still have those desires to do the
[17:56] same thing you did yesterday but God
[17:59] justifies you and your paper looks just
[18:01] like this I mean it really is it's more
[18:03] like that so this has got lines on it
[18:05] that's what your slate looks like this
[18:07] morning
[18:09] in God's eyes you never did do it in the
[18:11] first place but you've got to realize
[18:13] that because Satan is going to keep
[18:15] popping at you and popping at you and
[18:16] you know what tomorrow if you don't get
[18:18] born again today tomorrow you're going
[18:20] to go and you're gonna probably smoke
[18:21] another cigarette that's right you're
[18:23] gonna probably drink another beer say
[18:24] another cuss word
[18:26] see what's what I'm saying people say
[18:28] well I got born again I quit cussing no
[18:29] you're supposed to quit cussing in the
[18:31] justification and the sanctification the
[18:32] sanctification is the cleaning up part
[18:36] if you're still cursing you don't have
[18:39] you're just you may not even be
[18:40] sanctified
[18:44] and I hate these little words that
[18:45] people say that they're slangs
[18:49] they got words now that they say that
[18:50] means the cuss word but they are able to
[18:52] say it and get by with
[18:55] and I ain't gonna say them but if you
[18:56] want me to tell you later I'll tell you
[18:57] what they are but they sound just like
[19:00] what you're what you're thinking in your
[19:01] brain but you're saying it because you
[19:03] think well maybe I'm a Christian and I
[19:04] don't need to say something yeah I just
[19:06] don't like that
[19:08] at all
[19:11] you really ought not saying anything
[19:13] that you wouldn't go before the pastor
[19:14] and saying is in front of him because
[19:17] God's going to be there anyway God's
[19:19] going to know whether you mean it or not
[19:21] right but but this is a cleansing
[19:24] process and if you're in justification
[19:27] that's okay
[19:28] at least you know that's where you are
[19:31] right and God can God counts that just
[19:34] white righteous because if there's one
[19:36] Speck against you he can't give you the
[19:38] Holy Ghost
[19:39] come on people we got to realize
[19:42] that that justification takes you to
[19:44] glorification remember the sermon
[19:47] Embrace from justification to
[19:48] glorification if you're truly Justified
[19:50] you're just as justifying and glorifying
[19:53] filled with the Holy Ghost potentially
[19:55] because there is come a time you've got
[19:57] to receive it that's right because it's
[19:59] a gift Acts 2 38 says you will receive
[20:02] the gift of the Holy Ghost all right
[20:04] so justification baby form I'm Justified
[20:08] God I'm beginning to walk with you but
[20:10] God tells it is righteous
[20:12] so there's your white racist church then
[20:14] another white righteous Church went out
[20:16] that looked like the real Church
[20:19] but it was false
[20:21] started sayings then the sayings become
[20:23] Deeds Deeds become Doctrine Doctrine
[20:26] become law
[20:28] all right so that's what we get us with
[20:30] everything's in a progression okay does
[20:33] anybody have any questions about first
[20:34] days anything I missed or or forgot or I
[20:37] really forgot to read the scripture but
[20:40] let's read it and then now solving the
[20:42] lamb opened one of the seals
[20:44] it hurt as if the noise of thunder
[20:47] everybody won't know what the Thunders
[20:48] are
[20:50] they need to pay attention maybe they're
[20:51] being maybe they're being spoken
[20:53] sometime now
[20:55] one of the four beasts saying come and
[20:57] see
[20:58] and I saw so John Saul and beheld behold
[21:02] a white horse and he didn't sell and had
[21:04] a bow and a crown was given under him
[21:07] Crown was given
[21:09] he didn't have a crown Crown was given
[21:12] and he went forth conquering in to
[21:14] conquer
[21:15] now with that white righteous Church
[21:19] the false prophet began to speak
[21:22] right
[21:25] but there was a righteous Church on the
[21:27] Earth
[21:28] and in opposition
[21:30] there goes the wild horse rider
[21:33] same way you got to look in your life
[21:37] here stands a lamb and there goes the
[21:38] white horse rider the white horse rider
[21:40] went out in opposition to this church
[21:43] that's just a baby form just like you're
[21:45] just like your new birth starts in a
[21:47] baby form
[21:49] right
[21:51] you knew bird starts to talk a baby baby
[21:52] form
[21:54] um Jonas has got everything he needs
[21:56] to be a father or Grandpa a worker a
[21:59] Christian all that said enjoyments right
[22:01] now
[22:02] but he's laying in the in a crib and
[22:04] don't have a clue what's going on
[22:06] why he's developing right that's
[22:09] justification he's clean he's pure he's
[22:13] beginning his journey but if if
[22:15] something doesn't change
[22:17] he's going to still have those dirty
[22:18] thoughts those dirty ideas well I don't
[22:20] worry about dirty sauce because we all
[22:22] have them I did I mean the things we do
[22:24] the Deeds we do you know will come out
[22:25] the cursing and drinking and smoking and
[22:27] stuff like that that should be starting
[22:29] to go away from you all right but you
[22:32] still do them and be justified that's so
[22:34] that's okay but you can't stay here
[22:36] because what God moved on that's right
[22:39] I moved to verse 3 and when he had
[22:41] opened the second seal I heard the
[22:43] second beast say come and see
[22:45] and there went another horse so it was
[22:48] another horse because it was another
[22:49] characteristic
[22:51] okay another horse all right
[22:55] now when another horse that was red and
[22:58] power was given look at this power that
[22:59] was given Satan has no power except for
[23:01] what God permits so God's given him the
[23:03] power
[23:04] to do these things and was given to him
[23:06] actually the power comes from where the
[23:08] horse which is the power of the people
[23:12] all right
[23:13] and there went on another horse that was
[23:15] red and power was given to him that set
[23:17] their own to take peace from the earth
[23:19] that they should kill one another and
[23:21] that was given under him a great sword
[23:25] so now that's the second that's your red
[23:28] horse
[23:29] that's riding same writer Satan
[23:32] but you look here and you see that this
[23:35] was the fourth Church age
[23:38] correct which was the Dark Ages
[23:42] where Catholicism killed 68 million
[23:48] right here says they should kill one
[23:50] another
[23:52] in other words they were actually
[23:54] killing Christians but they thought they
[23:56] were the Christians killing the infidels
[23:59] you ever heard that that's kind of
[24:00] what's happening now you know we're all
[24:03] infidels and the other people are you
[24:05] know righteous well that same spirit
[24:06] it's the same spirit in them Islamic
[24:08] people it's the same spirit that was in
[24:10] the Catholic Church doing that right
[24:12] there all right
[24:14] which red means always sanctification
[24:17] because the blood of Jesus Christ does
[24:19] what sanctifies you cleanses and claims
[24:21] you all right
[24:23] so the red horse rider there was a there
[24:25] was a red Church there was a church that
[24:28] was that was that was physically
[24:31] physically
[24:33] bleeding he killed 68 million people
[24:36] there's a lot of blood
[24:37] oh yeah all right and brother Brown said
[24:40] Untold billions with their Doctrine but
[24:43] this was literally literally 68 million
[24:46] people died because of this age and this
[24:49] Spirit of this Ox they had
[24:52] but the spirit that that ran horse had
[24:54] was was To Kill
[24:56] right so it says right here to kill
[24:59] so that Spirit they had was the kill
[25:01] let it become a what a false prophet
[25:05] and then over here it comes to what it
[25:07] comes to a false prophet then it goes
[25:09] over and comes into a person this is
[25:12] about where they crown the pope
[25:13] somewhere in here all right in in the in
[25:16] this time they they really got to pulp
[25:17] here a few times in here but he really
[25:19] became in power
[25:21] because he sent a decree out it's better
[25:24] for a man to die for it's better for us
[25:26] to kill somebody
[25:27] trying to make them believe our Doctrine
[25:29] than to let them live that come from the
[25:31] Pope that didn't come from a king they
[25:34] didn't come from a great warrior I come
[25:36] from a cult
[25:37] what the Pope says they did all right
[25:40] but this was just a saying it was just a
[25:42] little saying but here become a deed
[25:44] what is the D that's something you do
[25:46] so that false prophet Spirit they
[25:50] crowned it
[25:52] then it comes over into here and it
[25:54] comes to be he spoke it what is the deed
[25:56] if I tell you to go cut the grass at the
[25:58] church I said D that's telling you a
[26:00] deed to do so that's what he's done he
[26:02] wrote down and said hey it's better for
[26:03] better for us to kill them than for them
[26:05] to live and not be a Catholic all right
[26:09] that's why it's red the red horse was
[26:12] the blood of the Saints but also red is
[26:14] a sanctifier
[26:16] so you got to look at the opposition but
[26:19] you got to look at what God's doing to
[26:20] the people
[26:22] now we know
[26:24] one thing's for sure every Church age
[26:27] had the baptism of the Holy Ghost for
[26:29] their age right because you got the lion
[26:31] Ox you still got them here lion ox man
[26:34] an eagle brother Brown Put them everyone
[26:36] in the church agent all right so every
[26:38] we can talk about sanctification
[26:40] justification all these things
[26:42] but remember
[26:44] the people in this age had the Holy
[26:46] Ghost for their age it wasn't just it
[26:48] wasn't just baby form justification they
[26:51] actually went through justification
[26:52] sanctification the baptism will hold
[26:54] those for their age they went through
[26:55] the same thing but we're talking about
[26:57] the age to see what applies to me and
[26:59] you right right everybody understand
[27:01] we've already been through this one time
[27:02] all right but see right here is where
[27:05] the unclean Spirit goes out
[27:07] remember the Bible says the unclean
[27:09] Spirit goes out of a man walketh and
[27:10] drive places seek a press and findeth
[27:12] none and if you don't fill it with
[27:14] something he's going to come back and
[27:15] fill it himself that's right right and
[27:18] he's going to bring seven of his friends
[27:20] that are more deadly than he was because
[27:22] they're going to be religious devils
[27:24] and they're going to make you think
[27:25] you're born again
[27:27] and that's the worst place to be in it
[27:28] but your characteristics going to show
[27:30] because somewhere in sanctification the
[27:33] unclean Spirit goes out that means the
[27:35] drinking the smoking the cussing the
[27:36] gambling the running around with women
[27:38] that's when that thing gets clean
[27:41] yes and you don't do that anymore I've
[27:44] told you many times the story of of just
[27:47] you know maybe seven or eight years ago
[27:49] I used to say bad words all the time
[27:52] but I was going down the road one day
[27:54] and I was talking to somebody
[27:55] and uh I was talking to one of my
[27:57] friends from out in the world and
[28:00] and I said well somebody ought to just
[28:02] keep that guy and I was going to say
[28:03] rear end or in the rear
[28:06] and the word AWS almost came out but
[28:09] when I got to the word a
[28:11] it's like something took right here and
[28:13] punched me right here and I went
[28:17] he said what did you do I'm driving that
[28:20] road what did you do I said oh nothing I
[28:22] said daughter kicked that guy in the
[28:23] rear they said okay but I almost said
[28:26] the word it was getting ready to come
[28:27] out of my mouth and God wouldn't let it
[28:29] come out
[28:31] it's just like somebody you know
[28:33] somebody hit you right here you're just
[28:34] not some breakfast whatever and it went
[28:36] when it went when I went for the a it
[28:37] went oh he said what happened I said I
[28:40] don't wear that he won't know it was
[28:42] good because he know something happened
[28:44] you know change and is it then you see a
[28:47] change here you see a big change here
[28:50] but don't fall back and stay in that
[28:52] change because that change can give you
[28:53] a religious spirit
[28:55] and then you can worship God
[28:58] you know how you know how I knew I went
[28:59] from sanctification of the baptism the
[29:01] Holy Ghost there was a law of the word I
[29:03] didn't understand
[29:04] and then when God started putting the
[29:06] word together see that's the real reason
[29:07] brother Brown said it's when you can
[29:09] accept the message for your day that's
[29:12] right it's when you know you got the
[29:13] Holy Ghost now except means just say oh
[29:15] I accepted yeah no that means we you
[29:18] accept something when when Jim gives me
[29:19] a gift I accept it it becomes mine
[29:22] and you know what I can use it so that's
[29:25] when I knew I had the new birth is when
[29:27] God started putting the word together
[29:30] and it just kept cuddling and kept
[29:32] coming and kept coming and I'd be
[29:33] sitting and listening to these preachers
[29:34] and they start preaching false Doctrine
[29:36] and a little bell would go
[29:38] that ain't right
[29:41] that ain't right
[29:43] we sat in the crowd of 600 people we
[29:45] told you this before and a brother gets
[29:47] up preaches some false Doctrine and
[29:48] everybody in the place jumps up and
[29:50] screams and shouts and all over the
[29:52] Praises God most of them wasn't paying
[29:54] attention
[29:55] today was about 10 or 15 I was sitting
[29:57] there then we never moved because I
[29:58] wouldn't go to amen something I didn't
[29:59] agree with of course the people look now
[30:01] now that's like they thought we were
[30:03] stupid but I wouldn't go away man
[30:05] something I didn't agree with all right
[30:06] amen I don't care what people some big
[30:08] man in the message and over 600 people
[30:09] got out and shouted
[30:11] follow me man
[30:13] the same people
[30:16] that on Palm Sunday said Hosanna to the
[30:18] king praise God this is our this is our
[30:21] man this is our Messiah
[30:23] within one week with less than a week
[30:25] from that Sunday to Friday them same
[30:28] people
[30:29] killed that man and said let his blood
[30:32] be on us and our children in four days
[30:34] their mind was changed from somebody
[30:37] changed their mind
[30:39] and kill that same man as they laid The
[30:41] Palms down and said Hosanna to the king
[30:43] their King had come back right four days
[30:46] later some ecclesiastical Pharisee or
[30:49] sadducee or or somebody had got to those
[30:52] people and they were crying for his
[30:54] blood in four days
[30:59] okay
[31:01] sanctification
[31:03] I think we're going to stop right there
[31:04] we'll do these other two next Sunday but
[31:07] if you want to write this down I'll
[31:08] leave it up here but the fourth age was
[31:10] the ox age the ox was what a beast of
[31:13] burden
[31:14] also the arch was used in sacrifice
[31:17] so that's your sacrificial and also the
[31:20] Beast of Burden Reed Fox's book of
[31:22] Martyrs read some of the the early
[31:24] history of how those people would
[31:26] actually go in to be killed and they
[31:28] would they would go in so freely until
[31:31] some of the Roman people that were
[31:33] guarding them said hey
[31:37] we want what they've done and they
[31:39] willingly walked into the lion's den
[31:41] they willingly walked into death saying
[31:44] I believe what these people believe
[31:46] because your Sanctified life is what
[31:48] people see
[31:49] and Buddy they'll pick you apart but you
[31:54] better make sure you sharp on that you
[31:55] pencil sharp on everything you do all
[31:58] right let's go up there
