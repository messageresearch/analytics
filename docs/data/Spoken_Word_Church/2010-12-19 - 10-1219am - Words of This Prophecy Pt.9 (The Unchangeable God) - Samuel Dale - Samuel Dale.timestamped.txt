[29:33] much
[30:09] you
[30:55] I
[31:26] wa for
[32:03] ni
[32:35] was not before Christmas and all through
[32:38] the town not a sign of baby Jesus was
[32:42] anywhere to be
[32:49] found the people were all busy with
[32:52] Christmas time chores like and making
[33:00] and shopping in
[33:26] Stars no one sang Away in a Manger no
[33:31] crib for a
[33:32] bed instead they sang of Santa dressed
[33:36] in bright
[33:52] red Mama read Martha Stewart
[33:59] and Daddy just settled down with a
[34:01] stocking
[34:10] cap as hour upon hour the presents they'
[34:14] wrap
[34:29] when what from the radio did they
[34:31] suddenly hear SE an ad which total big
[34:36] sales at
[34:42] Sears so away to the mall they flew like
[34:47] a
[34:49] flash buying things on credit and others
[34:52] with cash
[35:03] and as they made their way home from
[35:05] their trip to the mall did they think
[35:08] about Jesus oh no not at all
[35:30] their lives were so busy with their
[35:33] Christmas time things they had no time
[35:36] to remember Christ Jesus their
[35:52] King there were presents to
[35:56] WAP and cookies to
[35:59] bake how could they stop and remember
[36:01] who died for their
[36:15] sake to pray to the
[36:18] savior they had no time to stop because
[36:22] they needed more time to stop
[36:33] on
[36:36] Walmart on
[36:41] Kmart on
[36:45] Target on
[36:50] Pennies on
[36:52] hallmart on jails

[37:07] Denny's from Big stores
[37:11] downtown to the stores at the
[37:15] mall we will

[37:47] clatter as Grandpa hung icle
[37:51] lights upon his brand new step ladder
[38:03] he hung lights that would
[38:05] flash he hung lights that would
[38:11] twirl yet he never once prayed to Jesus
[38:15] the light of the world
[38:50] so let's not be like the rest so tired
[38:54] and
[38:55] stressed let's try to remember
[39:00] remember that the real reason for
[39:03] Christmas is Jesus this
[39:26] December this birth in a Manger to
[39:29] stable his
[39:31] home where he came to this world to
[39:35] bring it great joy the future of all
[39:38] would rest in this
[39:41] boy as a man he would lay down his life
[39:45] for us
[39:46] all but it started that Christmas in a
[39:50] Bethlehem
[39:54] stall Christ eyes how they twinkle
[39:57] I feel how
[40:02] many Christ love Christ love how
[40:07] normous all our burdens you'll carry
[40:43] so as you gather together this Christmas
[40:47] Eve instead of being busy overworked and
[40:51] uptight let's put Christ back in
[40:54] Christmas and don't forget to accept
[40:58] the one get that's free because he died

[53:19] business my announcements always been
[53:21] the same don't condemn those who put up
[53:24] trees in their homes we don't have one

[53:32] want one in your home put it up for your
[53:35] children grandchildren and things like
[53:37] that but if you don't want to don't put

[53:48] or you can prove that what good is it do
[53:50] to prove cuz it's not going to solve
[53:52] your conscience nor soothe it to prove

[55:08] ways and all but we know who and where
[55:13] the Christmas really started and it
[55:16] didn't start just as a a man's ideas
[55:20] because it's not that and Lord is
[55:23] talking about a savior who come to Earth
[55:26] and was was a baby and Lord as we saw a

[56:10] any questions comments Etc uh bring them
[56:13] along but now I wouldn't I wouldn't wait
[56:16] until then to be able to um think about
[56:21] what's being said I might be laying a
[56:23] lot of things in order that where when
[56:25] we get to there I can just say do you
[56:26] remember that and I don't have to repr
[56:29] preach it okay so I would pay attention
[56:32] to things all right remember the Bible

[56:36] January for this coming time because the
[56:39] the uh uh first Saturday would be you
[56:42] know first will be on Saturday so it'll

[56:47] that and I think I've got all up the
[56:49] ministers meeting will be on that day

[56:53] 11:00 and all so that won't TI up too
[56:56] much okay father we thank you we love
[56:59] you and we ask one thing of you and
[57:02] that's that you would come Among Us in a
[57:03] mighty way and that you'd speak to our
[57:06] hearts and our lives forgive our sins
[57:09] Lord lead us by thine understanding as
[57:11] we read your word you come and honor
[57:14] your word and back it up with signs
[57:16] following because we believe you and we
[57:18] pray that you would just bless each one
[57:20] that has gathered here today and that
[57:22] your love and your grace would be with
[57:24] us we love you and we thank you and we
[57:26] commit it all to you now in Jesus name
[57:30] amen Revelation 1:1 and the Revelation
[57:33] this is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[57:37] which God gave unto
[57:39] him now here's a key that I wish you
[57:42] watch it didn't say the revelation of
[57:47] Jesus right now hold that
[57:50] until watch not service it says the
[57:53] revelation of Jesus Christ right right
[57:56] right amen right now which God gave unto
[57:59] him to show unto his servants things
[58:01] which must shortly come to pass and he
[58:03] sent and signified it by his Angel unto
[58:06] his servant John who by record of the
[58:08] word of God and of the testimony of
[58:10] Jesus Christ and of all things that he
[58:12] saw blessed is he that readeth and they
[58:15] that hear the words of this prophecy and
[58:17] keep those things which are written
[58:18] therein for the time is at hand the time
[58:22] to understand amen okay Malachi 3 says
[58:25] what
[58:28] what for
[58:30] I am the Lord I change not right
[58:35] therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
[58:40] consumed oh my okay you may be seated
[58:43] the Lord at his Blessing to the reading
[58:44] of the word now the reason they're not
[58:47] consumed is because God don't change
[58:49] right if they were if it was that God
[58:53] would change then uh they we would all
[58:56] be consumed all right
[58:59] now over in uh
[59:03] Hebrews
[59:05] Hebrews 4 7 and
[59:08] 24 we see that God has an
[59:12] unchangeable
[59:14] priesthood right it was an unchangeable
[59:16] priesthood talking about mzc all right
[59:20] now so keep that in mind because that's
[59:21] what I want you to think with me about
[59:24] the top title of the message is this is
[59:26] number nine of of words of this prophecy
[59:29] but we're going to talk a little bit
[59:30] about the
[59:32] unchangeable
[59:34] God now as we read there in Malachi he
[59:38] said I'm God and I change
[59:40] not and I said a moment ago if he did
[59:43] change who would have a
[59:46] hope so you wouldn't have nothing you
[59:48] could depend
[59:49] on if God ever changed
[59:53] anywhere how could you depend upon it
[59:56] you'd be depending upon one thing one
[59:58] time and trying to depend upon something
[1:00:01] else at another time all right so now
[1:00:05] keep that thought in mind that you know
[1:00:08] he says Hebrews 13:8 what that he's the
[1:00:11] same
[1:00:13] yesterday and today and
[1:00:16] forever now my whole point will be based
[1:00:19] on one
[1:00:21] thing whatever God
[1:00:24] done it any any
[1:00:27] time he must do that
[1:00:33] continually or he would be changing
[1:00:36] somewhere
[1:00:37] right all right now very simple thought
[1:00:41] but I want you to get it
[1:00:43] now that's why the prophet of God said
[1:00:46] it like this he said if you can find in
[1:00:48] the Bible what God
[1:00:50] said he said you can call him on the
[1:00:52] scene and if he don't bring that to Pi
[1:00:56] he said you can call him a liar now
[1:00:59] that's strong is
[1:01:01] it but I mean that's what he said you
[1:01:04] say well that's only for him he didn't
[1:01:06] say it that way but that's your business
[1:01:09] what you think but now
[1:01:12] listen whatever God has ever done if he
[1:01:15] does it one
[1:01:19] time you must you can Bank on that that
[1:01:24] that's the way he'll Act every
[1:01:27] time now we change in what we think sure
[1:01:31] amen but God does not
[1:01:35] change all right now if he changes in
[1:01:38] any form now make it plain blunt up
[1:01:41] front if you can find where God changed
[1:01:44] in any form you can find any
[1:01:46] contradictions that's what a lot of
[1:01:48] people think is in the Bible and they
[1:01:50] think it's in the message too you know
[1:01:52] if you can find a
[1:01:54] contradiction then You' be able ble to
[1:01:56] prove that God changed am cuz he
[1:01:59] couldn't keep things you know he
[1:02:00] couldn't keep it
[1:02:02] straight all right that's why that we
[1:02:04] should be you know very careful about
[1:02:07] what we do to be able to keep our word
[1:02:11] right you
[1:02:12] know now because see if we won't keep
[1:02:15] our word God doesn't have to keep now
[1:02:18] listen to what I said he doesn't have to
[1:02:20] keep his but he will
[1:02:22] amen he
[1:02:24] will he'll keep it even though we don't
[1:02:26] keep our word right he'll keep his word
[1:02:31] why because he's God Amen John 111 what
[1:02:34] in the beginning was the word word was
[1:02:36] with God and the Word was God all right
[1:02:39] now we don't believe in trinitarianism
[1:02:41] and two or three different gods you know
[1:02:45] neither do we believe in the Oneness
[1:02:48] concept of that and and you know to me
[1:02:53] there's a middle of the road amen but
[1:02:56] the middle of the road cannot deny
[1:02:58] scriptures
[1:03:01] right we say you know people used to say
[1:03:04] I I got a scripture to shoot down your
[1:03:06] scripture you know like we was in a
[1:03:08] battle like Gunslingers you know
[1:03:10] shooting at each other or some kind of I
[1:03:12] got a quote it'll knock down your quotes
[1:03:14] well I don't believe it that
[1:03:18] way I believe what the prophet had to
[1:03:21] correct he
[1:03:22] corrected and anything else we better
[1:03:25] leave leave it
[1:03:27] alone all right I believe the Bible
[1:03:30] didn't have to be
[1:03:32] corrected all right now the prophet made
[1:03:35] human
[1:03:37] mistakes in staying things like white
[1:03:39] horse rider or something like that you
[1:03:41] know but he corrected that right all
[1:03:44] right now that's what we were going to
[1:03:46] get to one of these days somewhere
[1:03:48] probably after the first of the year but
[1:03:51] you know I'm trying to lay down some
[1:03:53] thoughts to you to where that when I
[1:03:56] want to get to the point that I want to
[1:03:58] say what I want to say then I can just
[1:04:00] say remember this remember this remember
[1:04:01] this we don't have to repr preach the
[1:04:03] message you said well just's give it to
[1:04:05] us right now if I did you wouldn't
[1:04:07] understand
[1:04:11] it he said boy you're
[1:04:15] blunt well it's true right why not say
[1:04:19] It Like It Is Well you mean the Holy
[1:04:21] Ghost can't reveal Holy Ghost can't
[1:04:23] reveal it unless somebody brings it to
[1:04:25] you
[1:04:27] oh now wait just a minute now well you
[1:04:31] you read your Bible that's what somebody
[1:04:33] brought to you right right you read The
[1:04:35] Prophet's message that's what somebody
[1:04:37] brought to you right so you understand
[1:04:40] what I
[1:04:41] mean Faith comth by hearing hearing by
[1:04:44] the word all right now but think on
[1:04:47] these things now the whole point is one
[1:04:51] thing that God can in no way ever change
[1:04:58] right so that way we can depend upon
[1:05:00] that now there's a lot of quotes in here
[1:05:03] that we'll give to you about the way he
[1:05:05] would say you know that if you ever heal
[1:05:07] one
[1:05:09] person and the other person reach that
[1:05:11] same place he's got to heal them that's
[1:05:13] right right ever save one
[1:05:16] person anybody else ever reach that
[1:05:18] place in faith he's got to save them
[1:05:20] right all right that's the way but I
[1:05:22] don't want you to necessarily hang on to
[1:05:25] that thought listen I want you to hang
[1:05:28] on to this thought if God ever done
[1:05:31] anything the way he done it one
[1:05:34] time he must continue to do that amen or
[1:05:39] else you'd have him
[1:05:41] changing so now we're involved that if
[1:05:43] he ever saved anybody if he ever healed
[1:05:45] anybody if he ever done anything but
[1:05:47] just remember now what I'm getting at
[1:05:50] cuz it's laid down here in the Book of
[1:05:52] Revelations the most beautiful thing you
[1:05:54] may wonder why that I I've kept reading
[1:05:57] in that and I keep reading it in
[1:05:58] Revelations
[1:06:00] 1 but that's the most beautiful
[1:06:02] scripture could ever be thought of
[1:06:06] right the
[1:06:08] revelation of Jesus
[1:06:15] Christ that God gave unto
[1:06:20] him to give unto his
[1:06:23] servant that's the greatest scripture
[1:06:25] you could ever think of you say well
[1:06:27] that proves a
[1:06:28] trinity cuz you got a god revealing to a
[1:06:31] son to reveal to the Holy Ghost get
[1:06:34] well I told you we don't believe in
[1:06:39] trinitarianism but I believe I believe
[1:06:41] God this is the way I believe the other
[1:06:43] things we've been talking about the
[1:06:45] Angels cuz that's where it is in here
[1:06:47] you know going to the angel that come to
[1:06:50] John and different
[1:06:52] things I believe there the calls
[1:06:56] ministers and preachers Etc calls them
[1:06:59] Angels Church age Messengers are called
[1:07:01] Angels right uh many things are called
[1:07:05] angels all then ministering spirits that
[1:07:08] come and the prophet said that the
[1:07:10] redeemed have only the redeemed have
[1:07:12] Angels so you have an
[1:07:15] angel you say well I've never contacted
[1:07:18] mine I don't know nothing about him well
[1:07:20] I read you to quote where the Prophet
[1:07:21] said it so it's not my fault he said the
[1:07:24] reason that we don't get in contact with
[1:07:27] our Angel is because the life we
[1:07:30] live did you remember that
[1:07:33] quote the life we live keeps that angel
[1:07:36] from coming to us brother brandom said I
[1:07:39] live so close to
[1:07:41] God until it forces the gift to
[1:07:47] work now that's what he had to say about
[1:07:50] so now don't blame the person sitting
[1:07:52] next to you you know
[1:07:55] right or the preacher that's preaching
[1:07:57] to you for not getting closer to God
[1:08:00] it's your problem it's your
[1:08:04] responsibility and if you don't get
[1:08:06] close to God then the angel won't
[1:08:08] contact
[1:08:11] you now that's what your Prophet said
[1:08:14] but see you don't like that and have I
[1:08:17] become your enemy because I found where
[1:08:19] the Prophet said it you when when Paul
[1:08:23] said have I become your enemy because I
[1:08:25] tell you the truth well see have I
[1:08:27] become your enemy
[1:08:28] because that you don't believe it well
[1:08:33] that's up to
[1:08:34] you but you see there's angels as I said
[1:08:38] there's preachers there's ministers
[1:08:40] there's Church AE Messengers there's
[1:08:43] Angels given to each Born Again
[1:08:46] believer and then there's
[1:08:48] cherubims and then there's Sims to keep
[1:08:51] the worshipper clean and then there's
[1:08:53] the holy ghost that can be called the
[1:08:56] angel of God that's
[1:08:58] right now to me it's all a work of the
[1:09:01] Holy Ghost right amen that's what I've
[1:09:03] been trying to get you to see it's all
[1:09:06] the work of the Holy Ghost whether it's
[1:09:07] the preacher preaching to you or the
[1:09:09] angel that contacts you you know your
[1:09:11] own personal angel or whether you're
[1:09:13] talking about brother Brandon being an
[1:09:14] angel or you're talking about the serim
[1:09:16] the prophet said uh there that would
[1:09:18] keep the worshiper clean it's all the
[1:09:21] work of the Holy Spirit that's why it's
[1:09:23] called there in the scripture we gave it
[1:09:25] to You' been over it's called
[1:09:26] ministering spirits that Minister unto
[1:09:29] the hours of
[1:09:31] Salvation now it doesn't say they're
[1:09:33] there for everybody in the world only
[1:09:35] the redeemed have
[1:09:37] Angels
[1:09:39] see and then see you say Well only the
[1:09:41] redeem have the Holy Ghost well all
[1:09:43] right you're talking right amen that's
[1:09:45] true only to redeem to have the Holy
[1:09:46] Ghost but just don't do away with all
[1:09:48] the other things it comes up to the Holy
[1:09:50] Ghost right is my
[1:09:53] point why don't you pray for to for God
[1:09:56] to let your angel come down and touch
[1:09:57] you talk to
[1:10:00] you now we're not worship of angels
[1:10:03] right that's right we're taking the
[1:10:05] scripture but you see whatever God does
[1:10:09] he never changes so what is his
[1:10:14] order what would be his pattern his
[1:10:17] order his way of doing then it would
[1:10:19] always start coming as we read in
[1:10:21] Revelations 1 it starts with God
[1:10:26] revealing to Jesus
[1:10:29] Christ and Jesus Christ
[1:10:32] revealing to his Angel and the angel
[1:10:35] coming talking to
[1:10:38] John that's always the order right
[1:10:42] that's always been God's order
[1:10:45] amen it's always been that he as he
[1:10:49] would start to
[1:10:52] condescend that he brings forms into
[1:10:57] view that will and I write this
[1:11:01] down he brings forms into view that will
[1:11:05] Express his character and his nature and
[1:11:07] his attributes because it is him right
[1:11:10] and without that order of events taking
[1:11:13] place there is no way for it to be
[1:11:15] revealed to us oh all we need the Holy
[1:11:19] Ghost that's all we need that the Holy
[1:11:22] Ghost well you can't get the Holy Ghost
[1:11:23] if you don't follow the pattern that's
[1:11:25] right
[1:11:26] now you can get anointings that's right
[1:11:28] you can get all kind of things
[1:11:31] right but you can't be in the right
[1:11:34] order right amen would we want to follow
[1:11:37] God's
[1:11:39] ways right Lord willing on the watch
[1:11:41] Night Service you'll see that as it
[1:11:43] comes down that he has not changed his
[1:11:46] ways none whatsoever
[1:11:49] amen the way he done it in the beginning
[1:11:52] he's always doing it and then when he
[1:11:54] starts the book of Revelations is
[1:11:56] exactly to tell you how he done it in
[1:11:58] the beginning right
[1:11:59] amen the Revelation that God give to
[1:12:02] Jesus
[1:12:03] Christ give to his servant amen he sent
[1:12:06] and signified it see by an
[1:12:10] Angel now why can't we believe that cuz
[1:12:13] he doesn't change all right let's read a
[1:12:15] few amen we're going have to get in a
[1:12:17] hurry
[1:12:18] but message hear you him brother ROM
[1:12:22] 1960 uh 313
[1:12:27] when God's ever called on the scene in
[1:12:29] the way God acts the first time he has
[1:12:31] to act forever that way right if he
[1:12:35] didn't he acted wrong at the first place
[1:12:39] right he done something wrong but you
[1:12:42] notice when God acts he acts every time
[1:12:45] the
[1:12:45] same that's right
[1:12:48] now if a sinner called and he Sav that
[1:12:52] sinner the next sinner calls he's got to
[1:12:54] save
[1:12:55] the next Center the next Center the next
[1:12:58] Center the next Center and all that call
[1:13:00] if a man calls for healing of his body
[1:13:02] and God heals him then the next one the
[1:13:04] next one the next one one that
[1:13:06] calls got to be healed on the basis of
[1:13:10] faith for either one that's
[1:13:12] right now but I say it now
[1:13:16] listen we'll take that and we'll just
[1:13:19] lay on healing or
[1:13:23] salvation I mean that's the the two
[1:13:26] things we lay it on right it's just
[1:13:28] healing or
[1:13:29] salvation but I want you to to lock in
[1:13:32] with me and I'll keep repeating this to
[1:13:35] where that you'll realize that God never
[1:13:37] changes in any way amen that's
[1:13:42] right the way he done something one time
[1:13:46] he'll do it again amen right why can't
[1:13:49] we depend on it the way he revealed
[1:13:52] something to to brother Donnie
[1:13:55] if we'll come in the same way and pray
[1:13:58] and seek God he'll reveal to us
[1:14:01] amen
[1:14:04] amen and we're not trying to be like
[1:14:06] brother brandham but the way he revealed
[1:14:08] himself to brother brandham is exactly
[1:14:09] how he'll reveal himself to you go
[1:14:11] brother random can't reveal anything to
[1:14:13] you that's where people go wrong with it
[1:14:15] y amen they think they read it and that
[1:14:18] means theyve got it now it's got to be
[1:14:21] revealed that's what I've been over and
[1:14:23] over and over with you amen how many
[1:14:25] times have I made this statement
[1:14:27] although that angel could come to John
[1:14:29] on patmas and there in in the first
[1:14:31] chapter and be there if Jesus Christ had
[1:14:35] not come on the scene
[1:14:37] amen it would make no difference that's
[1:14:40] right amen cuz the Holy Ghost is the
[1:14:43] only revealer of the
[1:14:44] word well I read what the prophet said
[1:14:47] well thank God now you got the seed
[1:14:49] laying there ask the Holy Ghost to
[1:14:51] Quicken it well I it was quick in the
[1:14:55] minute I read it well where you got that
[1:14:57] at well I got a quote from the prophet
[1:14:59] said you bring the word in and said you
[1:15:01] bring it in and said he'll Quicken his
[1:15:02] quick your brain in right I agree with
[1:15:04] you cuz that's what he said that's true
[1:15:06] but if it's brought in pure and
[1:15:08] unadulterated he'll Quicken it but if
[1:15:10] it's brought in in partial realization
[1:15:12] are messed up doctrines he cannot
[1:15:15] Quicken a a messed up
[1:15:18] Doctrine well the Holy Ghost reveal
[1:15:22] that that's up to you that's right I
[1:15:26] just say one thing he can't reveal
[1:15:28] anything outside of his word right
[1:15:30] that's right now if he does he ain't God
[1:15:33] right that's as blunt as can be but it's
[1:15:36] as straight as can be look what he says
[1:15:38] expectation
[1:15:40] 1961 here's the way I want you to
[1:15:42] believe it now that God is is infinite
[1:15:46] he's omnipresent omniscient and he's
[1:15:48] almighty God he's the same yesterday
[1:15:50] today and forever he cannot change and
[1:15:53] be God
[1:15:55] whatever God does one time makes his
[1:16:00] decision that decision has to remain
[1:16:03] forever it can never be changed God if
[1:16:07] God makes a decision this year and next
[1:16:09] year he changes that that shows he
[1:16:12] wasn't God cuz he's infinite and we are
[1:16:16] finite he going down talking about how
[1:16:18] that God keeps his word
[1:16:21] right you read all of these things Feast
[1:16:24] of the the trumpets 1964
[1:16:28] 719 he's talking about down Through the
[1:16:30] Ages and the seals and
[1:16:33] Etc God is unchangeable Malachi 4
[1:16:36] Malachi 3 says I am God and I change not
[1:16:39] God's first way of doing anything that's
[1:16:42] God's ever way of doing anything God
[1:16:45] decided he'd save Man by The Shed blood
[1:16:46] of an innocent one in the Garden of Eden
[1:16:48] and he has never changed it since amen
[1:16:50] and he cannot change it we try by
[1:16:53] education by building by by service by
[1:16:55] denominations systems by denomination by
[1:16:58] ethics and everything else it's all fail
[1:17:01] but there's only one place that God
[1:17:03] meets man that's under the shed blood
[1:17:05] only by the blood that's his first
[1:17:07] decision listen Ephesian Church age page
[1:17:14] 66 God manifest himself in her talking
[1:17:17] about to
[1:17:18] Bri the word can't change or be changed
[1:17:22] because the word is God Amen John 1:1 in
[1:17:25] the beginning was the word word with God
[1:17:27] and the Word was God to change one word
[1:17:29] of it as Eve did bring sin and
[1:17:34] death even as it says in Revelations
[1:17:36] 22:18 and
[1:17:38] 19 you know where that's over there if
[1:17:40] you had to to take away thus what the
[1:17:43] church at Pentecost is the
[1:17:46] standard that is the pattern there's no
[1:17:49] other pattern no no matter what the
[1:17:52] scholars say God has not changed that
[1:17:54] pattern
[1:17:55] but he can't change it he's
[1:17:57] God do you understand what I'm getting
[1:17:59] now right God identified him identifying
[1:18:03] himself 64
[1:18:05] 320 his characteristics never fails it's
[1:18:09] always is the same now remember his
[1:18:12] characteristics the characteristics of
[1:18:14] God cannot fail if it does then God
[1:18:17] God's failed and the Bible said in
[1:18:19] Hebrews 13:8 that Jesus Christ is the
[1:18:22] same yesterday today and forever
[1:18:24] therefore he is the unchangeable god
[1:18:27] whatever character he was at the
[1:18:28] beginning he is still that same
[1:18:30] character every way he worked anytime he
[1:18:33] ever done anything he does it the same
[1:18:36] every same way every time if he doesn't
[1:18:40] his character has changed see and his
[1:18:45] characteristics would display something
[1:18:47] that wasn't of God
[1:18:49] see so we wouldn't know words and we
[1:18:53] can't depend on them right
[1:18:54] characteristics change we can't depend
[1:18:56] on it right Jehovah Gyra 1 1964
[1:19:02] 402 God has not changed his ways God is
[1:19:06] the unchangeable god the way God does
[1:19:08] anything one time he has to do it the
[1:19:10] same way the second time remember when
[1:19:12] you see God action in any time if he if
[1:19:17] a man was lost and he saved a man upon
[1:19:19] the basis of any certain decision he
[1:19:21] made
[1:19:23] listen he has to to Always Forever stay
[1:19:26] with that same
[1:19:28] decision that's God see he cannot change
[1:19:32] it see he's he's infinite we're
[1:19:36] finite but God he's perfect infinite
[1:19:39] everything he does is perfect he can't
[1:19:41] make a decision today and make a better
[1:19:43] one tomorrow his first decision is
[1:19:45] perfect therefore you can just hang your
[1:19:47] soul on anything he says it's the truth
[1:19:51] now that is repeated later if you'll
[1:19:52] find it CU I want you to read it
[1:19:56] that's why I believe like I
[1:20:00] do that
[1:20:02] see whatever happened in the Book of
[1:20:06] Revelations has got to be the exact same
[1:20:13] way that it happened in
[1:20:16] Genesis or else God changed
[1:20:20] right has he condescended downward write
[1:20:23] it down
[1:20:26] and he condescended downward is
[1:20:28] identically the same thing that the Book
[1:20:30] of Revelations is saying right
[1:20:34] amen did God condescend downward through
[1:20:38] forms and ways right well now he's
[1:20:41] telling you in the Book of Revelation
[1:20:43] that this is the life book and the book
[1:20:46] that what that brother rown said page 13
[1:20:49] Church age book The Only book in the
[1:20:51] Bible where as Jesus personally
[1:20:53] appearing to to a
[1:20:56] scribe and like I've always said to you
[1:20:59] you can have all the head knowledge you
[1:21:01] want people have accuse me to be an
[1:21:03] intellectual I I can't help it I love to
[1:21:05] read I can't help it I love to listen to
[1:21:07] texes if I'm an intellectual what was
[1:21:09] brother brandham
[1:21:11] right he's the one that got it
[1:21:14] from so you're making him an
[1:21:17] intellectual but see all that can be
[1:21:19] laying in your brain it's no good until
[1:21:22] the Holy Ghost reveals you
[1:21:24] but when he reveals it you don't have to
[1:21:26] worry about nothing right that's why the
[1:21:28] internet is opened up I challenge
[1:21:29] anybody to show me where I'm wrong
[1:21:32] right that's not a challenge of of mean
[1:21:35] hateful doing no I want to be
[1:21:38] right right if I can show be shown where
[1:21:42] I'm where at oh of course now I've had a
[1:21:44] lot of people walk up brother Dale
[1:21:45] you're wrong of course I'm forced to
[1:21:47] fall down on the floor and say
[1:21:48] hallelujah I got straighted out no I
[1:21:51] don't do that way give me the word right
[1:21:54] show me in the word where I'm wrong
[1:21:56] right show me in the prophet's message
[1:21:59] where I'm wrong then I won't have to
[1:22:01] worry about I'll be on the floor that's
[1:22:03] right cuz I'll be
[1:22:06] repenting and wanting to be right but
[1:22:08] you
[1:22:11] see the unchangeable
[1:22:15] God never changes his ways look
[1:22:23] at look at number nine number eight on
[1:22:25] your notes evening messenger
[1:22:29] 63116 and notice now of course we know
[1:22:32] the story behind the reason I say this
[1:22:34] you know the reason I use a lot of it
[1:22:35] after 64 or 63 you know a lot of people
[1:22:38] thinks that brother Rand was wrong up to
[1:22:40] 63 and then after 63 he got straightened
[1:22:44] out well evidently God changed because
[1:22:47] he said I taught three processes and
[1:22:49] they're saying now that that that you
[1:22:51] don't teach three processes to the birth
[1:22:53] it's just a birth run said he talk
[1:22:55] threee processes from the beginning so
[1:22:57] somebody changed it evidently was not
[1:22:59] him though cuz that's what he had to say
[1:23:01] about it so I believe the message is
[1:23:04] right and if you don't have the message
[1:23:06] from from 47 to 62 and 63 you can't
[1:23:10] understand what takes place after then
[1:23:13] amen that's right but that's that's the
[1:23:15] way people think it so I just use a lot
[1:23:17] after that
[1:23:19] see and notice now you people all must
[1:23:22] remember this that God cannot change
[1:23:24] he's the unchangeable god times changes
[1:23:27] people change God is infinite he cannot
[1:23:29] change he is he must remain the same
[1:23:31] yesterday today and forever he must
[1:23:33] always remain and if we believe this to
[1:23:36] be the word of God we can put our
[1:23:38] confidence on anything that he said
[1:23:41] amen that's a statement needs to be
[1:23:43] quoted a lot right that's why I depend
[1:23:47] upon what he say right because what he
[1:23:51] says is right but if anything ever told
[1:23:54] told me anything he
[1:23:56] said you know told them to tell
[1:24:00] me I've got to have it in the word
[1:24:04] right I'm just simple in language and
[1:24:06] that I've got to have it in the word
[1:24:08] amen well the Lord told me to tell you
[1:24:10] well
[1:24:12] amen but he can talk to me too what he
[1:24:15] did through
[1:24:16] me well why are you so arrogant about it
[1:24:19] you know why are you so upset cuz I
[1:24:20] won't accept what you
[1:24:21] say no if the Lord sent you ain't going
[1:24:24] to send you that way cuz he knows my
[1:24:26] heart on the other end
[1:24:28] okay super sign 1963 11:29 I wish you to
[1:24:32] notice the unchangeable
[1:24:35] continuity let's back up I didn't finish
[1:24:38] that one on evening messenger now you
[1:24:39] see there how his message comes right
[1:24:42] how he sends his message he can't change
[1:24:47] that so every how he send his message
[1:24:50] he's got to send it every time right now
[1:24:52] we know the word always come to the
[1:24:53] prophet right
[1:24:55] that's the way he sent his message it's
[1:24:57] no problem we got it right
[1:25:00] right now then Super sign I'm trying to
[1:25:03] hurry up I want you to notice the
[1:25:05] unchangeable continuity of God's word in
[1:25:08] his Works see he never changes his his
[1:25:11] program he never changes his ways just
[1:25:14] as perfectly the scripture is in perfect
[1:25:17] continuity everything that God does is
[1:25:19] in continuity with what he done see and
[1:25:23] what he did first
[1:25:24] watch's that what he did first that's
[1:25:28] he'll do it the second time the same way
[1:25:31] and just to prove to prove it to you he
[1:25:34] has made laws in the earth and he always
[1:25:36] given his people a sign before the event
[1:25:38] happened now he's always done it and
[1:25:40] he'll always do it because he's the
[1:25:41] unchangeable god I am God he said and I
[1:25:44] change not that's why he said his
[1:25:46] program at the beginning that's the way
[1:25:49] it is in each age and he never changes
[1:25:51] it each age had a church age
[1:25:55] messenger each age had the Holy Spirit
[1:25:58] each age had God to reveal each age is
[1:26:02] always had the same
[1:26:04] right he's always followed the same
[1:26:06] pattern never changed right sir as we
[1:26:10] would see Jesus
[1:26:12] 64304 he was the word and he came to
[1:26:14] John in the water now did he come to
[1:26:17] brother randam in the
[1:26:20] water that right he come to John the
[1:26:23] Baptist in the water the of that day
[1:26:25] right he come to the Elijah of this day
[1:26:27] in the water he didn't change his ways
[1:26:30] right he keeps it every time he never
[1:26:33] changes his system he never changes his
[1:26:36] ways he's the unchangeable God now the
[1:26:38] church did did not believe that by no
[1:26:41] mean look at it how many of us
[1:26:44] believe but that didn't stop the program
[1:26:47] of God it went right on unchangeable God
[1:26:49] 62 120 or one yeah 120 the unchangeable
[1:26:54] God will give you the same holy ghost
[1:26:56] that he gave them there without a change
[1:27:00] he will do the same things that he did
[1:27:02] when he was here on Earth to any man or
[1:27:05] woman that'll believe it and accept it
[1:27:08] right if you got the Holy Ghost take a
[1:27:11] hold of it like Jacob did and hold to it
[1:27:14] un it until positive results change
[1:27:19] comes believe it friends and at an
[1:27:23] unexpected time time and maybe an
[1:27:25] unexpected date but he will do it at an
[1:27:29] unexpected
[1:27:30] date how much more should he do it
[1:27:33] tonight in an unexpected place where
[1:27:36] we're expecting to see it happen H
[1:27:38] listen future home 64
[1:27:42] 802 notice how God makes plain to us the
[1:27:46] Plan of
[1:27:47] Redemption oh this just thrilled my soul
[1:27:50] when I saw it he he makes plain to us
[1:27:54] here now his Plan of Redemption now
[1:27:57] compare what we see with our own eyes
[1:28:00] what God has done to redeem his
[1:28:03] world he's done the same thing to redeem
[1:28:05] his people for the unchangeable god
[1:28:08] changes not any of his plans or anything
[1:28:12] such a glorious thing am the way he
[1:28:14] saved the world the way he's going to
[1:28:17] save an
[1:28:19] individual
[1:28:21] unchangeable it doesn't change at all
[1:28:24] list
[1:28:25] amen glorify uh excuse me God identified
[1:28:28] himself 64 320 his characteristics never
[1:28:33] fails it's always is the same now
[1:28:36] remember his characteristics the
[1:28:38] characteristics of God cannot change if
[1:28:40] it does then he's failed see these are
[1:28:42] some of these are repeat okay cuz I want
[1:28:44] it there and the Bible said in Hebrews
[1:28:47] 13:8 the same yesterday today and
[1:28:48] forever therefore he is the unchangeable
[1:28:50] god whatever character he was at the
[1:28:52] beginning he is still that same
[1:28:54] character every way he worked anytime he
[1:28:57] ever done anything he does it the same
[1:29:00] way every time if he doesn't he his
[1:29:03] character is
[1:29:04] changed that's a repeat back over on the
[1:29:06] other okay the next one is a
[1:29:09] repeat God has not changed his ways God
[1:29:12] is the unchangeable god the only way God
[1:29:14] the way God does anything one time he
[1:29:17] has to do it the same way the second
[1:29:19] time remember when you see God's action
[1:29:22] in any of it listen
[1:29:24] the unchanging God number
[1:29:28] 15 never changes as as Christ is
[1:29:30] identified to same 644
[1:29:33] 414 4:15 excuse the unchangeable God
[1:29:36] never changes his way of doing things
[1:29:39] God has one way of doing things and he
[1:29:41] doesn't change at all when man sinned
[1:29:43] and fell in the Garden of Eden and God
[1:29:45] made a way for that man to be to be
[1:29:47] saved he never changed his ways he never
[1:29:50] changed
[1:29:52] s Christ is identified the same 64 4:15
[1:29:56] that's the only place that he will meet
[1:29:58] us the unchanging God he never changes
[1:30:01] his way of doing things he talking about
[1:30:03] through the blood and through the coming
[1:30:04] down the order of the shed blood his
[1:30:07] characteristics prove that he doesn't
[1:30:09] change himself he never deals with
[1:30:12] groups he deals with
[1:30:15] individuals he doesn't change that
[1:30:17] nature the only time he changes is when
[1:30:19] he goes to Israel he go to a group but
[1:30:21] he's still dealing to individuals
[1:30:24] make up a group there amen all right
[1:30:25] last one why had to be Shepherd 641
[1:30:27] 12:21 now you see the unchanging God in
[1:30:30] his unchanging plans of his word this
[1:30:33] day now just think a few minutes the
[1:30:36] unchanging word right now
[1:30:40] listen he said I'm God and I change
[1:30:44] not soever how he revealed himself one
[1:30:48] time
[1:30:50] right he will always reveal himself to
[1:30:53] son amen people say the Lord revealed to
[1:30:56] me a
[1:30:58] trinity Now where's that at in the Bible
[1:31:01] amen well you mean to tell me that he
[1:31:04] didn't reveal
[1:31:05] it no I'm just telling you ain't in the
[1:31:09] Bible you know they said to that you
[1:31:12] know them women preachers they said well
[1:31:14] I'm called to preach brother bandam
[1:31:16] said I'm just going to tell you it's not
[1:31:18] in the Bible that's
[1:31:20] right you know why because they believe
[1:31:23] there called
[1:31:24] you know why because they did get a call
[1:31:26] you know why CU they forced their way
[1:31:28] into it but God didn't change that's
[1:31:33] right God didn't
[1:31:35] change what he said one time you don't
[1:31:37] change it he said I'm God and I change
[1:31:40] not then why did they make a trinity out

[1:32:41] if you believe that I Chang
[1:32:43] not but if you think I Chang then where
[1:32:46] did I change at show me where God
[1:32:50] changed brother Adam one time made a
[1:32:53] statement like this cuz he's human he

[1:32:56] the father hated me right or God hated
[1:32:59] me he said I found out this self same
[1:33:01] person right amen we know that was his
[1:33:04] human ideas and him being a

[1:35:28] believe in a God that will keep his word
[1:35:31] I can depend on
[1:35:33] that the reason I can believe that I'm
[1:35:35] Healed is because he said I am right the
[1:35:38] reason I believe I'm saved is not
[1:35:40] because I seen this I seen that right no
[1:35:44] it's because I believe what he said
[1:35:47] right I told you about it I seen an
[1:35:49] angel of God in a church or something
[1:35:51] when I was 11 years old I never came
[1:35:53] counted that as my salvation never
[1:35:56] have no way my salvation is based upon
[1:36:00] what this word
[1:36:01] says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:04] and thou shalt be
[1:36:05] saved it don't change Satan can
[1:36:08] impersonate all those other things and
[1:36:11] give you all kind of signs and wonders
[1:36:13] that's right that's right you can see
[1:36:15] Angels you can see all kind of things
[1:36:17] around it don't make no
[1:36:20] difference if you can't stay with his
[1:36:22] word right amen you see if he won't
[1:36:25] change his word then me you are not
[1:36:29] changed show me where I've ever
[1:36:31] changed now I've tried to grow greater
[1:36:34] and greater in the message in the Lord
[1:36:35] and understanding yes but show me
[1:36:38] wherever
[1:36:40] changeed you know we never taught our
[1:36:42] children that Santa Claus come down to a
[1:36:47] chimney we always try to teach them
[1:36:49] about Jesus Christ they might have
[1:36:52] believed it because everybody else
[1:36:53] taught it but we never taught
[1:36:57] it we took when we were before we ever
[1:37:00] even heard of this message we monitored
[1:37:02] the things that our kids saw on
[1:37:05] TV that was in the 60s
[1:37:11] folks they were not allowed to see
[1:37:13] certain
[1:37:18] things why
[1:37:20] because I've always believed in being a
[1:37:22] Christian
[1:37:26] if God don't change why should we change
[1:37:29] now we should change for the better okay
[1:37:32] all right I always need to change for
[1:37:34] the better but now show me where I ever
[1:37:37] followed any of these
[1:37:40] doctrines that's come
[1:37:42] out and I studied every one of them you
[1:37:45] know why cuz I got to talk I got to
[1:37:47] preach to you whether it's right or
[1:37:48] wrong right right show me any of those
[1:37:52] doctrines that I ever fell in to their
[1:37:54] camps and went with them not a one now
[1:37:59] how many preachers can say
[1:38:01] that of course see when you say it that
[1:38:04] away they think you're sarcastic hateful
[1:38:06] arrogant Old
[1:38:07] Goat well I'm a sar sarcastic arrogant
[1:38:11] hateful Old
[1:38:14] Goat but I've always believed what God
[1:38:16] said that's
[1:38:18] right and I come in this message and
[1:38:20] heard what that Prophet said I didn't
[1:38:22] have any more idea is of my
[1:38:24] own I
[1:38:27] changed to believe what he
[1:38:30] said and to search out what he said
[1:38:34] because if I was going to believe him to
[1:38:36] be the prophet of Malachi 4 I was
[1:38:39] supposed to believe what he said that's
[1:38:41] right everything he
[1:38:43] said well then what about well that's
[1:38:45] like I said he corrected those y he
[1:38:47] corrected the things that were not right
[1:38:53] but see everybody now is correcting
[1:38:57] him well I sure hate to have to try to
[1:38:59] believe in his message if I going to
[1:39:01] correct him right but see God don't
[1:39:04] change you mean he can't keep his
[1:39:06] message right that's
[1:39:09] right well brother Dale brother so and
[1:39:11] so says this and brother so and so and
[1:39:12] says that and say I don't have nothing
[1:39:15] to do with it what is the Bible say
[1:39:18] right what if the prophet's message say
[1:39:21] right
[1:39:25] it says I'm God I change
[1:39:27] not so every how he revealed himself
[1:39:30] here in to John is exactly the way he
[1:39:34] revealed himself in Genesis now that's a
[1:39:36] key hold that quote in your mind what he
[1:39:40] done in Genesis he done it here in
[1:39:43] Revelations cuz that's the two books
[1:39:45] that you need to to read cuz that's the
[1:39:48] two books that Satan tries to keep you
[1:39:50] out of cuz Genesis shows you the origin
[1:39:54] and all like that shows you Satan The
[1:39:56] Book of Revelations identically starts
[1:39:58] off the same way to show you exactly who
[1:40:01] God is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:40:06] not Jesus the flesh right Jesus
[1:40:10] Christ that God gave unto
[1:40:13] him well you mean Jesus was
[1:40:17] God he's supposed to understand
[1:40:19] everything no he was
[1:40:21] limited cuz he limited himself
[1:40:24] right you remember how I preached it God
[1:40:27] limited himself right there not no man
[1:40:30] going to put no limit on God God limited
[1:40:32] himself he covered Us by the blood and
[1:40:34] he can't see us now isn't that a way of
[1:40:37] God limiting
[1:40:38] himself now don't tell me he don't know
[1:40:40] what we
[1:40:41] do but he's got it it's
[1:40:45] covered he's God and he Chang is
[1:40:48] not
[1:40:50] amen that's the way I depend upon the
[1:40:52] message
[1:40:55] right if I can find where brother Brown
[1:40:57] said it is a good thing but if I can
[1:41:00] find where he kept on saying it whether
[1:41:03] it be in the early Ministry or in the
[1:41:05] later
[1:41:09] Ministry but see like one big man in
[1:41:11] this message he said I don't like Bill's
[1:41:14] Oneness Doctrine you know Oneness talk
[1:41:21] language who are you
[1:41:24] right who gives anybody a right a
[1:41:27] prophet stands before nobody that's
[1:41:29] right right right right amen not that he
[1:41:33] wouldn't take correction no sir reading
[1:41:35] I don't get wrong but he stands before
[1:41:37] nobody but God himself amen that's
[1:41:41] right God had to straighten him
[1:41:44] out that's
[1:41:47] right he believed like the evidence of
[1:41:50] the Holy Ghost was love
[1:41:53] God straightened him
[1:41:55] out that showed him that was whether or
[1:41:59] not the spirit in you would continue to
[1:42:00] agree with the word he took that
[1:42:03] correction from God but he never got it
[1:42:05] from man on Earth that's right he might
[1:42:08] have heard somebody say something but
[1:42:10] God had to come
[1:42:12] down what about
[1:42:14] it what kind of a god do you believe
[1:42:17] in well down here he was this and over
[1:42:19] here he was that and over here something
[1:42:21] else no that's not Hebrew 13:8 that's
[1:42:27] right what he ever said he must keep it
[1:42:30] amen or he's not
[1:42:36] God keep that in your mind the
[1:42:40] unchangeable
[1:42:42] god starts off in Genesis showing you
[1:42:45] what happened how God condescended
[1:42:47] starts off in Revelation to show you a
[1:42:49] condescend go the Book of Revelation the
[1:42:51] entire Bible right
[1:42:53] that's right cuz he shows you what now I
[1:42:55] quoting brother around the seal shows
[1:42:57] you what has been what is and what will
[1:42:59] be so he showed the whole plan all the
[1:43:02] way back from the
[1:43:03] beginning we can find it in simple
[1:43:05] language let's stand
[1:43:08] together we're going to eat together and
[1:43:10] fellowship together so let's just sing
[1:43:13] if anybody has a need just brother dick
[1:43:15] come with the music music and if anybody
[1:43:17] has a need then the altar is open come

[1:43:38] together Fellowship together we invite
[1:43:40] everybody to stay with us and have a
[1:43:42] good time eating together and just you
[1:43:45] know think about
[1:43:47] him does your God
[1:43:51] change if he does
[1:43:53] how can you depend on
[1:43:56] it if he said one thing in one place and
[1:43:59] something else somewhere else how can
[1:44:00] you depend on
[1:44:04] Amen no
[1:44:06] way what it is is he said something in
[1:44:09] one place and then we try to find
[1:44:10] something else that looks like he
[1:44:12] changed his
[1:44:14] mind no uh-uh the grace of marriage and
[1:44:18] divorce was not God changing his mind
[1:44:20] you better get that straight that's
[1:44:22] right that was God God's word from the
[1:44:23] beginning right amen it was not God
[1:44:26] changing his mind right brother R said
[1:44:30] it because of a question in God's word
[1:44:32] there was not a question in God's word
[1:44:35] there was a question of mankind of what
[1:44:37] God Said in his word there was no
[1:44:39] question by God in his word right it's a
[1:44:43] question of mankind that had studied it
[1:44:45] right thought he had it figured out y
[1:44:47] God don't change his mind amen that's
[1:44:50] right what he said one time he's all
[1:44:53] wait go ahead let's find number 79 and
[1:44:55] just start with in the Red Book 79 in

[1:48:11] some of them but father it's not far
[1:48:14] after for you and that's what she wants
[1:48:17] she wants them to be for you Lord we
[1:48:20] believe it in Jesus is your name
[1:48:34] shall not
[1:48:38] be see God can't he can't change his
[1:48:41] mind that's
[1:48:43] right what kind of a god do we
[1:48:46] serve well God said it's all right for
[1:48:49] me to do so and so now where's that in
[1:48:51] the Bible
[1:48:54] if it was ever you ever never heard
[1:48:56] brother Bram talk about it you never
[1:48:58] heard him make the statement we're
[1:49:00] living in the AG when women just paint
[1:49:01] their face cut their hair clothes and
[1:49:03] right but he says now if your
[1:49:06] grandmother went out like
[1:49:09] that said they loock her up
[1:49:13] right well they just had grow in Grace
[1:49:16] knowledge what it was you they they just
[1:49:19] didn't
[1:49:20] know now he's trying to make us a
[1:49:23] statement right you know there's not a
[1:49:26] scripture in the New Testament talks
[1:49:27] about a man a woman wearing a pair of
[1:49:29] pants that's right can't find one can
[1:49:32] you you can't find a New Testament
[1:49:34] scripture says wrong for a woman to wear
[1:49:37] pants you that's Old Testament
[1:49:40] scripture but you know if it's Hebrews
[1:49:42] 13:8 it still means the
[1:49:46] same well now it's all right here but
[1:49:49] it's wrong back there
[1:49:52] like I told you about that boy talking
[1:49:54] to him about water
[1:49:55] baptism and I said the correct way to be
[1:49:57] baptized is in the name of the Lord
[1:49:58] Jesus Christ he said that's right boy I
[1:50:01] thought now I got somebody to talk
[1:50:03] to I said yeah that's where it's always
[1:50:07] been I said you
[1:50:10] know well it started out back there he
[1:50:12] said yep when it started out back there
[1:50:14] he said they baptized the name of Lord
[1:50:16] Jesus Christ he said now we baptize
[1:50:18] Father Son and Holy Ghost because we
[1:50:20] know the truth
[1:50:24] he said there's trinitarians the reason
[1:50:26] they needed to be baptized in the name
[1:50:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ you know what I
[1:50:31] never talk to him anymore go why talk to
[1:50:34] the Devil Himself I'm not making the man
[1:50:37] that why talk to something like that
[1:50:40] that his mind was so Twisted that he
[1:50:41] thought in the book of Acts he supposed
[1:50:42] to baptize the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:50:44] Christ but now we baptized Father Son
[1:50:47] and Holy Ghost because we know the
[1:50:49] truth he didn't know he was the pope
[1:50:51] himself M cuz that's what they
[1:50:54] believe but see God don't
[1:50:57] change go ahead
[1:51:00] brother find out if
[1:51:15] ready do you believe it
[1:51:23] God
[1:51:29] can't God told me my children would be
[1:51:33] saved I took his
[1:51:37] word why don't
[1:51:45] you if he tell you
[1:51:50] something s in the G one day talking to
[1:51:53] my
[1:51:54] wife I told her something was going to
[1:51:56] take place she said it won't do it I
[1:52:00] said I'll never preach again if it don't
[1:52:03] she said You Preach your life sermon
[1:52:05] well you know what naturally I would
[1:52:07] agree with it I said that ain't got
[1:52:10] nothing to do with
[1:52:12] it God told me and that's the way it's
[1:52:14] going to be you know
[1:52:20] what why can't you depend on him like
[1:52:22] that
[1:52:25] why can't you put your whole life on
[1:52:27] this word if this word not right I don't
[1:52:29] want to serve a God that can't keep his
[1:52:35] word God has to change his mind every
[1:52:37] time somebody else come
[1:52:39] alone how I don't want to serve a God
[1:52:42] Like That CU he's not my
[1:52:47] God he's like we are he has to change
[1:52:50] his mind every time he turns around God
[1:52:52] don't do
