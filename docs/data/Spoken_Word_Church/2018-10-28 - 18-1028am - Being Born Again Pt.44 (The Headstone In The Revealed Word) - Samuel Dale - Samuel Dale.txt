«  117       †        I am not He; I am His servant. And the Pillar of Fire is not He; It's in Spirit form (See?) which was upon the Son of man and has come now to anoint sons of men, to bring back a ministry just exactly like He said it would be, in order for the Head and the rest of the Body to connect together.
    Just like the--like the pyramid as Enoch built. And we find in that pyramid, they never did get the headstone on it. Why? The Headstone's yet to come. The seven steps in the--in the pyramid... We'll go through that someday, and I'd just like to show you how it really is perfectly with the Scripture.

«  233       †          Look, Christ in you makes Him the center of Life of the revelation. See? Christ's Life in you makes Him the center of the revelation. Christ, in the Bible, makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ. Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing, see, what God is trying to do.
234    What is the new Birth then? You'd say, "Well, Brother Branham, what is the new Birth?" It is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you. Amen! See? Not you joined a church, you shook a hand, you done something different, you said a creed, you promised to live by a--a code of rules. But Christ, the Bible, He is the Word that was revealed to you. And no matter what anybody says, what takes place, it's Christ; pastor, priest, whatever it might be. It's Christ in you, that is the revelation that the Church was built upon.

«  151_       †        Now, for the birth of the Word is Christ, not of polluted with denominations. The early Church, no denominations, just the Word, and Spirit irrigated. Brother, the... God laid the Word down like that, and the Holy Spirit irrigated It, and ...

your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever okay now we're going to try to conclude the message today so we'll be talking about the headstone are we're getting the pyramid it we see it where it's charity love you know we'll try to get to that so let's go to Zechariah to bring out this thought and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and said unto me what see us Dallas and I said I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it in his seven lamps their own and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top there and two olive trees by hid one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake unto the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel had talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying now what are these things that he saw he saw this Bowl he saw these candlesticks he saw these left stands but what would what would be as trouble on saying when he asked him what you see well I saw a lampstand I saw bowls I saw that that wouldn't the point right a prophet is knows that he's getting the Word of God and getting it in the right order so what is this that he saw alright now we'll read the scripture and see then he answered and spake unto me saying verse 6 this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts who art thou old great mountain before the ruled I shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone with shoutings crying grace grace untrue it you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word like I said then why would a you know you you show somebody something and then you say what did you see well I saw lampstands I saw this I saw that I saw well that's what you saw yeah but what you see and he tells him then what he saw was the word of the Lord coming unto Zerubbabel and Zerubbabel you know would be your Joshua as we would call it you know to represent the end time leader and all we're not gonna try to get into another like that we're just gonna get in to the point to where we can cover the headstone coming crying grace grace all right now we've spent quite a while just to review a minute we've been this is forty-four sermons that we've been talking about being born again all right and coming down to the place to ending it all up in our thoughts and ideas you know about what all of these things are all right now then what is the point of being born again now we were born wrong born in sin shapen in iniquity etc alright so then we had to be reborn or as Jesus said you must be born again he said you must be born from above in other words born where he came from all right so then that would bring the new birth into the point and what is the being born again it's the birth of the word right now what else would be as I keep saying over and over what else why would you think of the new birth being anything beside the birth of the word it is not a natural Burke Nicodemus said could I go back to my mother come forth again you know would that cleanse me you know to do some something way like that and he's no well what I need to do that for City you don't need to do that you need to be born from above you need to have a new birth all right and see then when you get the new birth Peter then says you don't stop when you got a natural birth you didn't stop your process you just started your earthly journey of the process so when you receive the new birth you just started your spiritual journey and Peter says being born again all right being born again is a process taking place okay so now that should should tie together our thoughts of where we've been doing you know for quite a while you know on the message of being born again we come through the stature of a perfect man we've taught it over over Day weekend week out trying to get us to see I've asked you to read I'm not asking for a raising of hands cause it'd be embarrassing but to say how many of you have even read the Statue of a perfect man or even listened to the message well see then that way it shows that your interest is not in the the things that we try to bring out because we want you to know for a certainty that the Prophet said it all right see then that away it's not what brother Dale says this or that no no and it's not brother Branham said this it's the Word of God given unto us to wear that is God speaking to each one of us all right to give us understanding of the and the growth development we went to that showing that you know you add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness etc is the growth development in your Christian journey all right we covered that that was what was eaten away in the Dark Ages the time you had up until about the fourth age you had them with Martin and and Columba and all of them coming forth with a real good understanding of the word and teaching the word and the Godhead and the things within you see the the cankerworm pommel worm locusts caterpillars start eating it away what was eaten away the new birth could not be eaten away because now you know you take even to the on the restoration of the bride tree see that life went into the roots you can't eat that away so ever church age had the new birth Satan can't take that away all right I thank God did that that is a truth that Satan cannot I don't care what he does he can not take that new birth away from you all right now he can and a lot of times stop you from receiving it because he perverts everything and does everything or make you think you know that you've got this or that or the other when it's not really there he can do those things but just remember if you ever get that new birth that's it you know that part is sealed the soul is sealed by the new birth and give an eternal life into your soul with the body and the Spirit is still out here in this natural realm all right now just trying to review a second okay then see the new birth is the birth of the word what else would you think about you see but I've spoken to her I said see you're talking about after-effects you're talking about a baby that comes into the world and then the baby cries and you're saying the crime is the baby no the crimes not the baby the baby's dire all right that's the after-effects are the things that happen with it are your evidence is okay which can go are you your experience of this or that I've done this I've done that I believe in a definite experience of the baptism of the holy ghost all right since you're in the prophets message I was born and raised a Baptist I didn't have no understanding of what it meant we always talk about a new birth but once receiving the message of the hour to see that it's the new birth is not to just believe God the new birth is not shouting it's not crying it's not they're speaking in tongues etc it's not those things it's the Word of God that is revealed to you there is your new birth all right then knowing the Prophet - what he taught it he said I taught it from the beginning future home see a lot of people say well he caught this and he changed his doctrine here will show me show me where he changed his doctrine see a lot of people like to get up you know that's why I like to read to you or at least quote to you what brought around and said cause a lot of people to get up and say brother Branham say it well you know that statement goes around the world and then you got a brother that was you know with the prophet eight with the prophet and don't only think and he's going around the world people looking to him like one brother said one time he said the worst part of it is he said you know said overseas said you say here we say Peter Paul James John now I won't call the names that he used but he said overseas they use brother so-and-so brother so-and-so brother so-and-so well that's all right if they teach the things that Peter Paul James and John talked but the point is that it's not taught that away and they take that as being what the Prophet saying because in a lot of cases they don't have any way of arguing the point first time true even to the the Philippines they had just begin to get books and and and things you know to be able to to bring the message to them because they couldn't argue with nobody you know I mean I couldn't argue with them because they didn't have the ability to argue you know they were to mercy of of the fact of what a little bit had been able to be brought their way alright let's see now listen that's what I'm getting at though the new birth is the birth of the word right all right and that new bird puts you in the body of Christ and it was the the new birth in every age all right now I admit the growth development of a lot of that nuber that was what was eaten away with the cankerworm pond were local kennefa was eaten away the things the Prophet you know and the Apostles had talked all right we're built on the foundation apostles prophet Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone so then our problem is that we're still a lot in a lot of cases we're still just taking what somebody says only you know we're trying to make our own doctor no pointer issue that's why I like to say what did the Prophet say all right why did he say the new birth is he alright then we've got it and we read his answer What did he say this and we read his answer well I think it in the Cedars where it goes he said I think it doesn't have anything to do with what I think are you think it's what God said Jesus said you must be born again that was the first message that he preached alright and see then he told what the new birth is he said that you know it's it's like a woman having a baby in a thing so then when the Prophet taught the nuber wouldn't it so wonderful to wear that he'd say now in the days of Martin Luther he said just to believe what he said he said was great you know and that started the just shall live by faith and he goes on to John Wesley and he picks up sanctification then he goes on to the Pentecostals and picking up the baptism with the Holy Ghost so what they say the new birth is justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right there's your new birth which is what the birth of the word what is justification it's the word what is sanctification it's the word what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the word made alive by the spirit into each one all right so we've come all the way down brought it to that point to where that we're we're fellowshipping around in in the life partner coming up through the virtues and bringing those into being and we've read from the Prophet how that you have faith to be you're born again at faith all right he said how faith and be born again then these are the things God expects you to add all right so that was the the restoration back to the faith of the fathers okay now he started out in his early part of his ministry and he would make statements that were outstanding and people you know that read the message they saw well we can't understand this because he said that you don't listen to him he's talking of the stature of a perfect man even back in 56 on the old message called the inner veil or why were people so tossed about something I think they changed it but even back to that he said God walking in instrumentality on two feet in the people he was teaching the deeper depth of understanding that the Apostles had brought right and teaching that to us that made it confusing because he said I can conclusively prove that you are born again and then baptized into the body see we we had it all figured out we thought we was doing pretty good we come up with a point of the new birth we thought that was doing pretty good but see then he would say things like that and he'd say that was right and then he'd turn around and say he said I taught three processes from the beginning and he said never changed in one iota well whatever he was teaching in 50 may not have been the deeper depth yes pride right we understand that but he was teaching the new bird correctly when he started out teaching I believe that because he was a prophet and God's got opened the word to him okay it's like I've always said about it's either you got Peter in them trained by the Lord Jesus all of those years three and a half years and come forth with preaching the statute of perfect man Paul is a prophet God takes him to the backside of the desert keeps him out by self the only visits a little bit here in our different places in the book of Acts a couple of times you know and one time he'd say never conferred with any of them within one time he said taught with Peter and him well he never what he done he never got down into doctrinal issues or situations and he goes by his self and God teaches him the word on the backside of the desert he comes out and Paul and Peter are not teaching anything different it ain't Paul teaching one thing as a berth and Peter another thing they're teaching the same thing so whatever Peter taught Paul talk is that sensible if not they talk something different whatever Paul taught Peter taught whatever Peter taught Paul taught all right that should be settled but like I said he would say a lot of times statements I can prove you're born again and then baptize anybody he's teaching adoption he's teaching a growth development in Christianity I can say that you are born again by the new birth and then each one of these virtues is baptized into you you have a birth of each virtue as it comes forward we've been 40-something sermons on this you ought to know a little bit about it but you know I try not to be so much dry but I was sitting there I want to go time lord I need to just go back and start all over you know I need to back up 44 sermons and just start over you know because if you're not getting it we probably said hold it up until they get it he said didn't move on well see the it becomes to where you think well you're just doing it in stress no I'm trying to get you to see the Word of God if you don't see it you're the one that will get disinterested in it you know I've talked to seals I've been through the seals I've been through the son of man but it sure is interesting to me sit and listen to white preaching the message it's interesting to me for these little brothers you know to preach what they see that's interesting to me see yes I'm not one saying well I'm the kingpins got to come through me know when you think that you ain't too much of a fan either a better King or anything but now listen to what I'm trying to say see then that adoption stature a perfect man is the same thing all right what is it an adoption you're born into the family all right then that child has a tutor to raise it okay and it comes up through those things and and when it does it comes out with the nature of the father and then the child is given the authority of the father that's exactly what Peter is teaching because he's teaching you're born again as a baby in Christ and then you come up the statue of a perfect man as guards will read in a little bit seals these things into you and see then you have to go up to period you can't say well brother I ain't got time now let's go up your brother Connors ain't got time food with all that other go ahead you've had 50 years since the Prophet left to see and if you're still teaching stuff like that it'll take you another 50 so welcome to the real world okay because that's how plain I talk all right you say well what's the problem of us being here 50 years since their private us okay don't need to say it again oh how about you saying it Oh some of you did and some of you didn't so I got some that said okay you know this is amen brother Donnie says you know this is amen if you do it real strong that's really a big ati girl okay all right but listen see then the adoption the stature of perfect man is all the same as teaching the growth development of Christianity that was eaten away by the cankerworm pom worm locust in the caterpillar it wasn't a new bird that was eaten away it was the Holy Ghost in every age and they ain't no way the devil could take that away but he could take away the growth development of understanding in the Christian experience and he ate that away through those things but that was to be restored in the last days they took the Prophet 30-something years to come to preach the stature of a perfect land all right he said well I know how he was brought well I wasn't the one that said it come on and did did you remember this and reading the book you remember where he said he was up in the woods hunting and he got the scriptures of faith virtue knowledge temperance places that he said I got that just the other day well you know what if that's right he didn't have that quicken to him until that day all right not if he hadn't read it not if he hadn't brought things about it and picked up parts about it right but to bring it down see now he knows I've tried to explain that 450 to almost 50 years here's a man with trying to explain what he sees you know a prophet sees a a wheel in the middle of the wheel things like that and he tries to explain it he tries to put it in human terminology and what is it what did we read here in in the scripture well what do you see well I see bows I see this I see that and then he said what did you see and don't you understand what you see ya see balls and and God said that ain't what I'm talking about I'm talking about the word of the Lord that comes through the Prophet all right now forgive me let's see church they tried then to put into words what they saw and that's what the prophet has done in this last days to you and I he was to restore the faith of the fathers that's according to Malachi 4 right and then he was to bring his message well his message was his message right was to do that his message was to bring forth those understanding of the virtues and adoptions and I hear he hymns and you know all of those messages sure that was partyís message but that wasn't the whole that's it he says on the rapture message we'll read it the minute he said that was when this message come he had a message was to be brought and that message was to be would not be an addition to the world my lord look at the wonder situation or position he was standing in in 62 there when the Lord was opening that about the adoptions about the virtues and about those things what a wonderful thing it was to to stand in that place to think of God restoring back to mankind what he originally had in his word that's a wonderful thing but to think of that he said knowing all alone that the message would come what message do we have do we have something that do we have the Bible as the Bible and then we got a prophet as an addition to it now come on that ain't true well brother Branham no no wait a minute no it ain't true he's once said it I didn't they said what would your ability you could do this that he said you you you're doing wrong he said that's wrong he said because you can't add to he said it's got to be what's in the book all right in the book of what light had never shined upon something that was in the Bible now listen watch the faith of the father's being laying in the Bible but yet not understand by mankind the Apostle Paul comes alone and Peter named really didn't explain the indwelling are are the engrafting of the Gentiles they couldn't keep all of that straight they had trouble in in the book of Acts over the different things and and bringing in Paul did with bringing Timothy in and and they all had trouble Paul's the one who done it and what was Paul's great mystery was the engrafting of the Gentiles I remember that back in the Baptist when they would preach on the engrafting the great mystery cuz you could read it in the book I mean you could read what it was what is this mystery the engrafting of the Gentile are to bring another Gentiles into the body of Christ all right well see that wasn't a full historical that was just the in grafting of the Gentiles see what was the mystery of Revelations ten seven that one mystery it says which would cover all the mysteries what was that God sent a prophet to bring us to try to restore those things that were taught by the Apostles and once he brought that to a restoration then his message opened something I tried to explain to you over and over what is it that was in the Bible that was not understood by mankind now come on you say well it's in gray sure the engrafted of the Gentiles is a part of the mystery but that's part of the mystery that could be understood even in the Baptist we taught those things where were you at no wonder brother Brennan said leave him Baptists alone he said they'll tire you up with the word we tried our best to stay with a word we're arrestee I was Tooting it out to whistle having your glory hallelujah time but at least we didn't believe the word you know I don't care to say it I don't lie about it the Word of God has been there see it was there in the word the Gentiles being in grafted in but it was lost in the faith of the fathers and it had to be brought back and brought into clarity but there's more than just the engrafting of the gentiles there is a mystery that lot had never shined upon right here comes the prophets he's a pyramid sees each time which the top off looks down in these things you know no light have ever shined on these things what was that Matthew 24 the seals lot never shined upon those things as I said even to the basses and to emphasize so much that even Paul Paul never spoke of the son of man Paul never spoke of the mysteries of the seals Peter was there with Jesus when he said that and he never spoke of it that was withholding from them and like it was - Peter look who the men say I the Son of Man Hannah he is asking about the son of man what did Peter say thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God what did Jesus say he said upon this rock I'll build my church well on the revelation of Jesus Christ being the son of God we've really he was literally saying to Peter you didn't answer my question I asked you who the son of man you told me who the Son of God is we've got to build a church on that we said I'll come back I'll come back a son of man for just a little bit he said I'll bring it forth that was what was something was so great to me when I saw it I told you listen to the tapes going to working back well for one week we didn't nobody you know anybody any one of the four of us would choose a tape bring it we had one of those players with the batteries and and everything and that thing has run down them any time but it have enough power to run the voice I set tire with my finger and turned that tape for an hour would you do that no you just found the book and you close it up and forehead I've set there and turned that thing for us to listen because it had enough on the batteries to bring the voice in okay because the I'm concerned but about day five it struck me the unveiling of God it struck called brother Branham had always said God come in three sons nine son of an Sun God son of David I knew there was a problem and I couldn't figure it out cuz I knew they had to be a son of man come back in this time I had studied the message and I knew that something was wrong with our understanding I see in them the message on the valent he said just for a moment he comes back as son of man oh I said glory I got it Lord its son of man who gave His life to release that son of God to come back through the church ages with just a little bit in the end time it would come back a son of man again and then go to son of David because you can't go from son the Jews will not be able to go from the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the Millennium it's gonna have to increase to them to understand of the Son of Man because son of man is the Millennium that's the resurrection o son of man he said I am the resurrection when you talk about son of man you talk about resurrection you're not even talking about restoration it's registered it's not that and it certainly ain't Reformation Laurent church what does it go to the Prophet had a message of we've been through that over he said not in the years of preparation we said when he begins to sound he had a message to bring what was his message those seals to be brought to the bride and it would open now listen I didn't write the book you don't hear him in 55 saying the Bible's becoming your book when do you hear that come on after the seals broke after the seals broke he said the Bible had become a new book that's why I tried my best to get you to read the titles of the messages after the seal he's priest one true and living God within he comes right back and he said if you have any problem in there in the seals and things and don't father and don't understand he said he didn't say go back and go through the seals again come on you ain't listening to the message he said go to Christ some history he said come back to this book why because DARS where he preached the true revelation of one true and living God was in Christ a mystery and that's where that we get to the quote from when we say brother branham what is the new work he said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that's on Christ from history but do you follow what I'm talking about see then what was the message that the Prophet was to bring sure he was to do now what is it 327 Church age book I'm quoted at 50 years What did he say this message of Malachi 4 they supplemented their revelation to himself or something in order I know but Malachi 4 will do two things 1 turn the hearts of the children back he said in 2 the second part is to reveal the seven thunders which are the revelations contained in the seven seals and it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn us back why people are scared of the seals then they're denying the point the Kate they can be turned back they can't you can't be turned back to the face of the fathers without without the opening of the seals show me how you probably just said that you arguing with healing Oregon with me well I think we can just that's just like saying well I know I'm born again so I don't need it I'll jump up here and beat brotherly kindness I'll just jump up your top we'll jump all you want to you're gonna get a flop through when you come down but that's alright but alright now listen what is the new birth it's the birth of the word right what is the new birth momentum it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you cross the mystery of God revealed spoken word as original seed now for the birth of the word is Christ the birth of the word is Christ look at number four you must be born again false teachers bring false birth true prophets will bring the word the birth of the word Christ true teachers come on get that we've got a world is that prize yes well how many times you won't were brought around said a prophet isn't a New Testament preacher is the word prophet you say well he's wrong here with he's wrong over there so they didn't just forget it see you understand what I'm getting at but the one thing that has been missing what is the one thing that's been missing all right we've established the message of the Prophet I'll read some more in just a minute would be the opening of those seals and from that opening of the seals am i quoting you from the opening of the seals comes marriage and divorce is that a quote from him you know that everything that's revealed in the Bible is I don't know where you would call it revealed in part here and in fullness but the fullness would come through the opening of those seals what about serpent seed there was preached in 58 but the Prophet said revealed in the seals see then if you'll understand that you'll understand what I'm saying that here he comes forth on 57 on this on the Hebrew Siri and over and over and over declares Melchizedek to be Almighty God but then when he comes over after the seals break what does he preached listen to the title who is this Melchizedek not who he was he knew who it was backg are now who he knows who he is and where he's at and it certainly not brother Brent him and it certainly not me and you but it is the entire bride of Jesus Christ she becomes the fullness of the Godhead bodily then holding brother branham and when she does that then she is the son of man made manifest I told you I talked that 1969 what I need to worry about it it was darkness still standing today but yet people don't want to hear something like that they want to hear some tantalizing that is tantalizing to me when the Word of God will tie together from Genesis to Revelation and I can see him to be the same yesterday today and forever are you with me so it's been what was that you'll see why did I've talked this over and over from 40 years ago all right now listen what was that the light had not shined upon the seals so there was a prophets message to bring the seals he said all alone not in the healing campaigns in there but he said knowing this message would come what is that message that's see if I can find that one hurry he's no no you should I'm his own rapture okay if you can get over to number six pull up numbers suit look what he says now there's a messenger above and it always a messenger on earth the English word messenger means we met English word angel means a messenger and the seven angels message while he was making his proclaiming his ministry then listen then when he began to sound forth his ministry not when he started out when he started out he started healing the sick and the afflicted and everything everybody wanted him but keep on going what did it get - they don't want those disciples not not been able to explain it but they believed it whether they could explain it or not they said right steel and believed it how could they - how could they tell if they were going to eat the flesh and drink the blood how could you do it they couldn't need to flesh what they believed what he said what was what he said not when he started out but when he got on down into his message how many times do we need to cover her brother Branham said it like that he said when he brought forth his Jesus started preaching he said long as he healed us in everything everything is fine but said when he began to talk about I and my father one see then they backed away from it because they couldn't do it alright but here's the one I won't go back to number five while you they're close because this is the one I want you to get when we talk about the birth of the word we've talked about that but this is the one I want us to think about if I don't get the rest of it I'll finish it up this is off the message the seeds shall not be heir with the shock all right 65 Pentacles took speaking in tongues now watch him they deny the supernatural even Mary we'll get to that eventually one of these days in the minute even Mary denied the supernatural birth of the word when she said you know your father and I have sought you she denied it okay look she denied the supernatural birth Pentecostal Pentecost took speaking in tongues they denied the birth of the word that's exactly what it did it'll take so much it'll take so much of it but won't take the rest of it it denied the birth of the word just like Mary did now let's don't do that if you don't understand nothing whatsoever that I try to teach try to remember one thing the new birth is the birth of the word no I come to the older brother Dale and I come and I cried and I prayed and I felt this feeling and I got a new birth now you're right in the devil's traps because you can get all kind of feelings and signs and sensations and have nothing to do with the new birth why don't you say it right whatever directed you to the altar was the word you had heard what did it do with it I suppose the word they hailed they took that word and held on to it it's what took them to the Upper Room what took you to church I heard many of you tell your testimonies that you were sitting here you without you and in this church or that church or whatever and something just directed you to go was that you shout and screaming in the hall in the crowd something happened you heard something you would have been with me that day when I tried my best to get a brother and I was reading brother branham worth it he said that Mary heard the word from her mother and this brother he let it on me and he called me everything in the book he said I'm tired of this old mother doctrine that people's preaching someone he said yeah I'm saying it come from Mary I said well that's what the Prophet said he said Mary brought her the word I said where did it come for for everybody they heard the word you've got to hear the word before you can be born again well he didn't he didn't like that but that didn't bother me I was just trying my best to get him to see a simple point faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word you've got to hear the word before you can be born again now you heard it from somebody somewhere and as you did then God could quicken that because remember what we were talking about now give for a second Jesus Christ when he came he was rejected by the Old Testament people right you know what he would have been the headstone had they accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior he would have been the headstone and they turned that down that's why your prophet teaches it brings it out what that the headstone hadn't come yet well I thought two hit songs is her where'd you get the right to think I thought we're supposed to take them out our thinking that he's thinking but see he was rejected by the children of Israel the Old Testament and he was accepted by the apostles which were disciples as followers the Apostle means one sent so they were followed him as a disciple and they went to the upper room and then they were sent forth all right now he could not come as the headstone to the church even in a New Testament church why because they'd not heard the word all right now watch that it appeared to see they hadn't heard the work they heard what Jesus taught them and God quickened to them the things Jesus said but now you show me where he quickened those seals to the apostles you can't do it that was withholding that was kill all right would he come the head of the corner the Bible said you remember we've been on that another day the headstone to Israel became the cornerstone to the new testament bride he didn't become the headstone to the new testament bride sure he is her head come on but he's not the headstone because they rejected the headstone now listen before you can have the headstone you've got to have the cornerstone is that sensible [Music] and if you want to make the headstone a great big steeple setting on the church we'll call that a headstone okay now if you ain't got the cornerstone to hold it up what you got then come on folks I hope you'd be onto the point to what we used to tell say well what would you hang it to we were hanging on sky hugs you ever heard add you've heard people talk about well what's that hanging on it's the Scott hook what does that mean that means it's held up in the sky according to hook up in the sky well now that ain't right so are you with me what I'm talking about before you can how the headstone you've got to get the corner stone look at the pyramid is this the headstone would it fit anywhere in here except a corner parts no you got to get it built up correctly you got to have the cornerstone and that's what Paul was saying to the heart decisions that we're built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ in the chief Cornerstone you gotta get you stuff cornerstone correctly that's why it took brother branham 30-something years to preach that cornerstone to bring that cornerstone and get it to where they could build a building you can't bring the headstone straight down onto the cornerstone that's plain sensible we're not system where we got it my revelation glory hallelujah unless you're you revelation all right but listen so you got to get the cornerstone so what did brother Ryan have to do go back and read we'll get on it if you want to go back and read in Zechariah well let's just read that up I'll get it fast enough verse eight moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying the hands of Jubilate the foundation of this house and his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that I am the Lord your the Lord of Hosts has sent me unto you then who has who has despised the day of small things brother Minister that's God and simplicity for they shall rejoice and see the plummet in the hand of Jubal with those eyes which are those eyes of the Lord which run to and fro throughout the whole earth all right come on down who are these they're the anointed ones that stand beside the Lord who is the rubble and he's gonna take you back to the foundation because it doesn't say that is rubra bull he lays the foundation he don't bring the headstone because you got to get him in part let him do what he done thought around him in his ministry bring them on up into the message listen what is it then what is this message the rapture I'm rich I'm not responsible for it must must and I must salt yet say it and my message all the time knowing back dar under healing and so forth like that was just to catch the people's attention knowing the message would come and here it is what is his message come on now you got something you can talk about now you got a headstone you can talk about remember you got to get you cornerstone right because he was rejected as the headstone and he come become the cornerstone to the New Testament church all right that didn't bring the headstone to the New Testament church uh-huh you have to go down through then through faith virtue or knowledge temperance patience godliness Rosalia to talk about the headstone the headstone is the revealed word all right the new birth we covered that over and over the new birth is the birth of the word all right if that's true if you least settled out enough in your mind to think about then you order have be settled enough to know that the headstone can't be something difficult the headstone has to be the word that was not made known in the point of bringing to the cornerstone nursery seven seals it the Prophet Bravo come on there's your seals the headstone is the opening of the word all right we declared what the prophets message was to open those seals there was what was sealed up in the world that Lyda never shined no I'd have never shined on those opening of those seals mankind couldn't follow it there was no way cuz you got to get your cornerstone back in position you got to get Giroux beable where he can do this part and then this other part can take place you see then what the headstone to the church is you see why that I've always taught it I've always from the first thing when I saw it back in the at least in the 79 and coming on in 280 that I saw that headstone as being the seals now listen to what I'm saying please the new birth is the birth of the word all right so you've got to hear the word first then it can be birthed right so the disciples heard the word and the Bible said they took it and held it and when the Holy Ghost came it made alive now listen the new birth is not the word unless the Spirit comes upon the word the new birth was not the disciples in the Old Testament hearing Jesus preaching three and a half years and two times in the Book of Luke it says he opened their understanding in John it says that he breathed on them and said receive you the Holy Ghost but that was the Prophet said that was a promise they had to wait till Pentecost right come on then you couldn't have the new birth in the Old Testament you could have a planning of the word and even a quickening to the degree that they held on to it because the Bible said he opened their understanding but they had to go to Pentecost to get it may why because the birth is not just the letter of the word you hear I never talked to her that's what you probably think when you say brother F says the new birth the birth of the word well okay then I read the message almost how's new work no no no no it's when the birth the word is made alive baby in the Mama's wound I'm glad we've got a profit we don't have to argue with nobody they say well the baby was alive is doing this forget it well sunset song forget it we ain't playing science the Prophet said a baby wasn't alive until it breathes a breath of life he said sure it's got wiggling muscles he's got a heartbeat it's got all kind of things but it ain't alive until that soul comes into that body so was it were the apostles they had the great mechanical machinery the prophet calls it they had up the mechanics which was the the the the quicken the word they had those things they could talk to Jesus about it but they're about two seals they didn't know anything about and that wouldn't open to him in the upper room right in the upper room was open to them what God wanted them to have which brought them to the faith of the Father all right what is the new birth when you hear the word and that word is made alive by the Holy Spirit Dyer is your new bird now are you with me not because you read it not even say well I've been in the message and God quicken this to me God quicken this to me God quickened thanks to me when I was in the Baptist Church I was in the Baptist Church when I said to my wife that before the end of the world come they gonna be two prophets he quickened that to me cuz I could read the Bible he quickened that the son of man was the resurrection son because I could read but that didn't give me the new birth I was listening I've done it listen 2/6 read six books and listen to two tapes in one day you've tried that you can drive 70 miles to Doral at that time and 70 back and we still doing those things why because all I wanted was one thing I knew that if he was a prophet then that word the message he brought that's what I told brother mode I said you can tell me what you saw you were there you saw the dead raised the sick healed I said you told people you know like brother Taylor and them I knew the Tatum's before I come into message but I said tell me what he taught and I'll know whether he was a prophet or not I sure I'm glad I got ahold of somebody that knows something about the Bible instead of this junk in the message you gotta believe that around with some prophet he had signs and wonders well you got to believe that well tell me what he felt well I can tell you what he thought I'm just telling you you've got you got to believe him to be a prophet you don't believe in to be a prophet you're gonna die and go to hell now come on you know it would turn that away to you right did that bring a berth see then what is the new birth as I've tried to explain you hear the word and then the word is made alive all right what is the headstone the Word of God that was never known by mankind in those seven seals but just because we can read that and because we can make the seals and the Ten Commandments the same thing as the Prophet said it was that does not give you a new birth until the Holy Ghost fold on you and quickens that unto you what do you mean I mean exactly one time you can't understand in thing in the Bible terminologies until you're born again that's when the word is quickened are made alive to you so the seven seals isn't this because you've heard it just because you read it doesn't give you the birth of that it takes the Holy Spirit to come down to anoint that well I heard the prophets say it praise God but that don't make it alive Peter and him heard Jesus say it and they had to go to an upper room to get the Holy Ghost to have the new birth so what is the headstone sure the headstone is oh those seven seals are C word but it's window seven seals is revealed to me in you now this is I've got an end it cuz there's no way to go wrong but listen go ahead to number let's get a couple of these go ahead to number eight please but you spoke a word a regional seed brother Brennan says it like this these last days true church bride Church bride comes to the headstone i watch her will be the super church a super race as near as the great headstone there will be much like so much like him even they will be in his very image in the order to being united with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God denominations can never produce this this will they will produce their creeds and dogmas mix with the word they can't do it but he says he's in the last days a true church bride comes to the headstone she's going to be a super Church now remember what I taught before it'll start all right the new birth is not because you heard the word read the word you read it all your life that is not the new birth it's when the Holy Spirit quickens that word to you then you have the new birth so we've had 40 years or 50 to listen to the seals in The Times that's wonderful because the the seed can get into the field now you've heard the Prophet say it you got to get the seed in the field before it could be quickened I mean that'd be walking out here over this continent is asphalt in the spring of the year and said boy I've got a corn crop cuz I I planted it right here on this but weird the corn go I guess the birds made it but yeah okay but in huh you get the point listen what is the headstone first you got to find out what it is find out if it's for you because that's the new birth you got to find out what the new birth is and find out it's for you all right it's for them that the Lord have called right so what is the headstone it's the quickening of God's Word all right it's the making alive of God's Word I believe and I've taught it from the beginning now this is going to be me for a second so listen the church don't come together all at once you understand what I'm talking about Jews are dealt with as a group of people the Gentiles are dealt with as an individual all right so brother Branham could stand on this earth I've had people to argue with me and I said well boy you in bad shape because they say well well you know you can't how the headstone and die I said well then the Lord Jesus was in bad shape because he was the headstone and died I said brother branham aren't you gonna believe that at least he had the headstone and he died see because that's individuals remember statue of a perfect man individuals come up the church comes up all right individuals can be adopted into the family ahead of others we don't come all at once it ain't a church group that gets adopted all at once it's individual that are adopted in the body of Christ that's why some were ahead of the other statue of a perfect man there's people all up and down to me and way I believe all up and down this whole period that you're looking at there's people there and that's why the Bible said they without us cannot be made perfect there's something that somebody's got to stand to draw it alright so what are you saying I'm saying then the seals can be broke to individuals and be the headstone to the church and that person could be capped off but not as a group ask only how but cut them or read it to you okay but you get individuals that are adopted into the family and then the whole church will be adopted okay go ahead let's read it number nine individuals can be brought in but then the church will be brought in it will be to a church and then you got what the Prophet said and why he made these statements the dynamics and you know what its dynamics is dynamics is what the mechanics is the head or the letter of the word the dynamics is the quickening of that word all right are you with me the dynamics of this church look what it'll be will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit I love that I'm looking for something to happen I've always looked for something to happen well cause I could read the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have work and watching in a small measure while the head is coming down to unite with the body okay but when the head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ where hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of holiness and take a flight to the skies the dynamics is the Holy Spirit brother Dale are you expecting an outpouring of the Holy Spirit yes are you expecting a revival I've always told you I have a revival every day that I read this message in here not know world wide sweeping revivals opening hospitals no no no no no that's to the Jews get that out of your mind well why can't the bride have it because we just went through it just a few weeks ago brother Brown said he'd take them seven unknown thunders back there to wake that bride up well did he teach it right all right then where are we at the dynamics listen go ahead to number ten well brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost now this is off of questions and answers in 1954 all right in Jeffersonville oh brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year you think he didn't know back dark what he was looking at what all theologies failed to do in 2,000 years now watch him you wait till the anointing of the church really strikes home to that faithful the little remnant after the doors of the Gentile is closed God will anoint a church then okay now what's him he whose filthy let him be filthy still he who's righteous let him be righteous still he whose holy let him be holy still and God will anoint the church with the power of God and things will be taking place not only that see that's where we die listen not only that then but he's doing it now oh you mean God is anointing his church well what do you think's happening if individuals you agree with a head shake or something a minute ago that individuals we can get adopted into the family and not as a group so individuals of the fact as individuals can be adopted into the family and that's God doing it now that's him sealing people into the body of Christ as individuals but one day he's going to anoint the whole church and he'll do in one year that's wonderful he's I thought to be short that would be a mighty short one go ahead 11 and dwell and then we'll quit number 11 the statue of a perfect man now you should have remembered these into building the virtues building this one you up building this stature see it starts off with the foundation stone faith virtue or knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness now what does it do now you come up through faith works or not to information what does it do then they're waiting for the headstone which is love so an individual comes up to the statue of perfect land fiber sir and I'll attempt replacement Gardner's waiting for the headstone which is love charity all right know where God is love the waiting for the headstone would you love for god is love and he controlled and he's the strength of every one of these things that's right yes sir right in here right in here you see I got it in between all these little works in here and here are these little waves come what is that the Holy Ghost coming down through Christ now look at the pyramid Becca and see you look at what is saying the Holy Ghost coming down through Christ see Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is above all this way holding it together building of what a perfect church for the capstone to cap it all once it's been done it what's it been done again it's manifested through seven Church ages and seven church messengers all right now unless if this other go ahead number twelve statute of perfect man here you are seven church ages seven steps God building his church is like one person into an individual into himself the glory the power of God coming down through this welding it together therefore the Pentecostal people that let out the Lutheran that out the Westlands and thing doesn't know what they're talking about you see they lived in this part of the temple that's the way some people can come up that high and drop off but there's a genuine part of that keeps making that building come on I will restore self the Lord remember the bride trees in the night and in the evening time it shall be like that's when Christ the Holy Spirit Jesus comes down and sets himself at the head of the church look at you permit who is this this is Christ this is God this and all to go when he comes to set himself at the head when he anoints the whole church all right and he will resurrect this church being his own body in there is the body and the way God is expecting us as individuals to grow the way he has brought his church in to grow ever church age it becomes one big church that what are you expecting I didn't give him this one but it's from the message three kind of believers paragraph 97 that's the reason I do believe that when that bride is called out and elected and set in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven that will take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride that'll take her from the earth in a rapture in grace God promised it God promised it alright maybe I got too fast in the life's of trying to get you to see but I want you to see one thing you cannot have the headstone until you get the cornerstone and it placed in correct order the cornerstone is a faith of the father's the headstone is this message the Prophet brought the opening of the seals and then the things thereafter approved it was the headstone go look what he preached after the in future home Christ the mystery unveiling them God the one I love is the mighty God unveiled read that one and notice in it see on the unveiling of God he's unveiling Jesus Christ and brings him into bride form but on the mighty God unveil he goes straight to the bride and takes her through and then one of these days we'll get back to it that's where that he goes to seed not out with a shock and a things like that and he says Mary represented Pentecost and said Mary rejected the word we read it to her a little while ago Mary he says the seed is not and I watch them quote he said Mary's not to seed now naturally Marie was not to seed right naturally Mary born the seed which was Jesus Christ so Mary's not the seed but there's got to be a seed come and all people can talk about the seed what I was born with it feeding me if I'd born defeated me then I make it they know nothing about the Saint Mary was one who gave birth to the seed but the Prophet said she was not to see he was a carrier but yet all we can talk about seed it's whether you got something in here not I love where the Prophet said what is it it's representation from predestination he said well I've born to see brother Brennan said then you better be careful now I can quote pretty good sometimes he said Moses had that guilt he said he was born with he said ever individual is born with that gift in them now what are you gonna do with that quote because see you'd be a respecter of persons if you didn't get to everybody if you put some kind of seed in one person didn't put it in the other one so let's get away from that seed like that well oh if I was seated I'll be there be work well he saw me there right he went to hell and saw people he went to heaven some people is that being mean where's it being truthful see that's saying we can we can die quoting but do you understand what I'm getting at come on musician the headstone to this church is the capstone which is Christ what are you looking for brother Dale I'm looking for a bride to walk in the light of the word until she becomes the word then God will come and back her up yeah but we ain't got the signs and wonders why are you built on signs and wonders when you're talking not to prophet taught you not to deal on signs and wonders he said you getting the devil's trap here dealing with signs and wonders we hey we believe in signs and wonders right did the Prophet believe in signs and wonders but did he teach that you can get deceived by signs and wonders does the Bible say that if a prophet comes among you and gives a sign and it comes to pass but if he takes you to another God don't believe him now what God said because I sent him among you to try you brother Branham said I love this oneness itself the god of this evil age he said God wants to prove that the bride won't fall like Eve so he's got to put us through the task I just don't understand brother Dale why is everybody else being so great and all this other in this house and we're just so pitiful we just ain't got nothing going on we just all floating alone and just having problems I just can't hardly exist I've just got everything's after me the devil bit on me all week long praise God if brother al was here he'd holler amen he said brother Dale I woke up two or three times life not in the middle of the night I said you pray for me he said yeah I should wake him up earlier Lord then I didn't mean Ted and I said wake him up where you pray for me you can't sleep pray for me I guarantee you I'll guarantee you that if you pray for me now let's see if this guarantee is gonna be right you pray for me and I'll give you five minutes you'll be nodding 10 minutes you'll be snoring so if you want a good night's rest pray for me because the devil ain't gonna let you he's gonna bleed on you why don't you do like I do I just get up well if I wake up I'm what I get up and I walk through the house and I just pray for everybody here I just go a lot of times I go see it at the time I just pick them up and I name everybody and ever see that they said and put everyone to know you know and then I'll start at the back and I'll come back this way I'll name everybody well you know what I'll go back to bed and I'll go to sleep won't you try that once you try praying for somebody you said well I prayed all night long did you pray sincerely what about it you said well done okay I'm not throwing off on the vice praying I'm saying did you pray sincerely that's damn well we'll try to pick up some other thoughts now out of this series trying to end it up today with the hip stone being charity which is Christ and I love those statements of the game how else could a prophet make a statement and him being a prophet he said Christ coming down through God's Holy Spirit and what kind of language is that a theologian look at him and say why do you know where are you saying he said I'm saying what God told me to say it's the Holy Ghost coming down through Christ's Holy Spirit sealing all of these things together that's not many cards but it's a manifestation of God what a wonderful day go ahead brother what we got anybody have a need then we're pray for Wade this afternoon I have [Music] that takes me the quickening of the word is what I'm talking fight with Larry why did you let her go [Music] he's in the house period I'm a shield of love I claim the blood jeez I don't care those precious bloodstains were made there just for me my say yes and my pain when I need him an artist quaint those fresh blood I do not know how there's make it through go take care right well please she's coming to it so gradual until people don't see it they're looking at other things [Music] [Applause] [Music] why just weari in rejoicing see - see that you gotta have something that before you can believe we know what I believe they've signed while you walk up here alright why can't we do it why can't we believe it so what I just don't know where I'd believe what's wrong with you what's it gonna take what's it gonna take to strap the church to make her believe but brother you just don't seem to believe in signs and wonder I believe in the word first and then sad that wonders will follow the word I talk to you from the beginning that I'm looking for a revival to strike but I'm in that revival i've told from the beginning back in the sixties the word the bride would be the fullness of the Godhead bodily quoting brother Branham I'll be glad to show you were there I didn't save him things he did well I just don't believe well then you don't believe him it ain't me that you don't believe that's why I quote a lot of things you got a face well you just quoted it wrong well okay now we'll leave that between God and us but if I said it you gotta say that part right I did say it and I never tried to make anything big or little I try to be this exactly what we're all supposed to be born-again believers come on I'm too old I guess I come down through and lived an old life coming through that we try to live decent in the Baptist Church we tried to live decent one because we're supposed to be Christian well I'm glad run around and come along tell us about hiring clothes he had to tell you that [Music] my mother put on a pair of pants a pantsuit telling one time there's only time she ever wore anything like that as far as anybody knows but you know who gave it to her she put it on one time took it off said I can't wear that you know who gave her the my sister that her husband was a Baptist preacher she won't it hurt mama to wire clothes like that mama said I ain't gonna wire [Music] did you see what I'm talking about see one of these days you'll realize the church is what God would put us wrong and it's still doing it because it's still dwelling in us we were to stand on the word and just forget the rest of it father we thank you for today and we pray that what we said is worthy I'm sorry for being like I am taller than screaming but I wish I could scream louder all we say have the voice to keep it up and preach all day long about you Lord because you know yourself what I've tried to do all the years and try to bring to the people a revelation of you Lord not a revelation of me or anything else a brother branham or anything but a revelation of you Lord and then all that other is wonderful because it has its place we love you and we thank you just let the people go and think about what's being said they want to know what the headstone is the revealed word this message is revealed to us Lord it is our head and what are the head would we want and to be guided by you have your way in Jesus name you dismiss [Music]
