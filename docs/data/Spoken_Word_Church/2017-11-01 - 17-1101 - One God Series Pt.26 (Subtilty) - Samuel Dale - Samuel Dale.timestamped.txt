[3:30] where we can have everything you know
[3:32] where everybody don't have an excuse but
[3:35] that's a good point
[3:36] okay but let's just pray father we thank

[3:43] we ask you now that you would just come

[4:10] hearts that we may see the day as it is
[4:14] and what's taking place in the hour that
[4:17] we're living we love you and we thank in
[4:19] Jesus name Shawn one says in the
[4:28] beginning was the word and the Word was
[4:30] with God and the Word was God
[4:31] the same was in the beginning with God
[4:34] all things were made by him and without
[4:38] him was not anything made that was made
[4:40] in him was life and the life was the
[4:43] light of men in light shyness and
[4:46] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[4:48] at night now there's no way darkness can
[4:52] comprehend light it won't work all right
[4:56] now let's just read over in 2nd
[4:59] Corinthians 11 to get our thought for
[5:02] tonight Paul says verse one would to God
[5:08] you could bear with me a little while a
[5:11] little a little in my folly and indeed
[5:16] by women now what's he sayin okay
[5:21] would to God you could bar with me a
[5:24] little in my folly folly means
[5:29] foolishness okay but now it's also got
[5:37] another meaning to it
[5:39] the Cosi Paul says in first Corinthians
[5:42] what it 1:22 something I guess he's
[5:45] talking about the preaching of the
[5:47] gospel his foolishness or folly to
[5:51] mankind so he said I would that you bear
[5:54] with me as I try to preach the gospel
[5:57] well in my way that I can to where you
[6:02] can understand and make it as simple as
[6:05] can be and people would call it
[6:08] foolishness all right now watch what he
[6:11] says I am jealous over you with godly
[6:14] jealousy for I have espoused you to one
[6:16] husband that I may present you as a
[6:19] chaste virgin to Christ but I fear lest
[6:24] by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[6:27] through his subtlety so your minds
[6:30] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[6:32] that is in Christ you may be seated
[6:36] the Lord had his blessing to the reading
[6:38] of the word now I have an unusual way of
[6:42] trying to approach the thought tonight
[6:45] that we'll be getting to but we've went
[6:49] through for a while and the you know
[6:52] trying to cover the things and and
[6:55] seeing and bringing it then we brought
[6:57] it down to mankind and you know of Adam
[7:01] and Eve not total mankind we brought it
[7:04] down to the creation of Adam and Eve and
[7:07] the wonderful way that God made them and
[7:10] he could not in any way make either one
[7:12] of them imperfect because you say well
[7:15] Eve wasn't made right well she was made
[7:18] out of Adam
[7:19] how much more right can you get because
[7:24] if you say that she wasn't created right
[7:26] you're saying Adam wasn't created right
[7:28] so then you understand what I'm getting
[7:29] at see then that's he was created as
[7:33] perfect as could be so Eve would have
[7:36] been created as perfect as you know she
[7:39] could be all right now but then we found
[7:43] I said an unusual way of approaching
[7:46] because we've dropped into a stage and
[7:49] watched the message tonight as it comes
[7:52] through all right we talked about what
[7:56] is sin what was the original sin all
[8:00] right yeah we found out that sin is
[8:04] unbelief sins not drinking gambling
[8:08] smoking running around with women stuff
[8:10] like that that's not sin you do those
[8:14] things because you're an unbeliever
[8:17] that's the attributes of unbelief all
[8:23] right you say well Christians have done
[8:25] wrong this way
[8:26] yeah and we're we know the message and I
[8:28] thank God for a prophet that would
[8:31] explain a lot of things to us Oh
[8:34] even that see that you could go out and
[8:37] and go totally insane and and do things
[8:41] wrong and stuff like that and God does
[8:43] in the county well thank God for the
[8:47] truth about the things that doesn't
[8:50] leave us to just be as we had you know a
[8:53] thought or an idea of doing now what
[8:57] we're going to do next Lord willing
[8:59] Sunday we're going to start picking up
[9:02] to try to pour it bring in the form of
[9:05] what is salvation and bringing it to a
[9:10] position to understand but what we want
[9:13] to do tonight is to do what I had said
[9:15] that remember whatever the original sin
[9:20] it was you know all right then
[9:26] that sin is still here now in its
[9:31] original form still dire and that's why
[9:35] we read from Paul you know that Satan
[9:41] who could tempt us and he's talking to
[9:45] the church through his subtilty as he
[9:48] did to Eve there in the garden all right
[9:51] now then we talked about sin as it is
[9:59] unbelief see the eve accepted Satan's
[10:05] lie which is only one word off right
[10:13] only one word off instead of taking
[10:17] God's word she accepted Satan's lie
[10:23] bringing it to unbelief first aren't
[10:29] unbelief in God the God would keep his
[10:32] word and do what he said then the actual
[10:38] act took place all right so then we say
[10:43] well what was what was original sin it
[10:46] was even the Beast you know no the
[10:51] original sin was the unbelief okay
[10:56] unbelief in God's Word
[11:01] she was desiring wisdom all right
[11:07] Satan told her or begin to speak through
[11:11] the Beast to talk to her about things
[11:15] and she began to reason with him to
[11:22] think about what he was saying and you
[11:25] know a lot of what he was saying I hope
[11:28] you caught that the last couple of
[11:30] Nations just called that's what I'm
[11:31] trying to get it to now that you know he
[11:36] didn't tell her this is a great big what
[11:38] you call an outlandish lie you know he
[11:43] didn't do that he just deceived her into
[11:47] believing what he was talking about and
[11:52] to get her to disbelieve God and His
[11:56] Word now not to just believe there was a
[11:59] god right prophet said no no no he said
[12:03] she believed in God but by tempting her
[12:09] the way he did through his subtlety
[12:14] and the word subtlety is actually here
[12:20] and brings it down to where brother
[12:22] Branham told us that Satan the actual
[12:25] quote to where he told us that Satan had
[12:28] a knowledge of the principles of life or
[12:31] that word subtility is the word that
[12:34] star
[12:35] you know as to bringing it to that all
[12:38] right now but really what I've done was
[12:43] she doubted God would keep his word
[12:48] after she had been told come on you
[12:55] remember the message she were told was
[12:58] told a truth she was told that you were
[13:05] told there in Genesis 1:28 to multiply
[13:10] and replenish the earth and said you
[13:16] were supposed to do that then we went
[13:19] through it where brother Brown said that
[13:20] was a commission from God that would
[13:22] have taken place here's were that I'm
[13:28] getting I told you that would be we'd be
[13:31] nailing down heavy tonight on this point
[13:36] see whatever the original sin was Satan
[13:41] is still using now quoting brother
[13:43] Branham he said he's still using the
[13:45] same identical tactics that he used in
[13:49] the garden he said because it worked so
[13:53] he's using it now
[13:55] yeah but the devil's not bothering these
[13:57] not just we're in the message we've got
[14:01] well why is it the people of this
[14:06] message are running after the wisdom and
[14:10] the things you know and parts of
[14:12] wellness this or that or the other or
[14:15] whatever making it so beautiful until
[14:19] people will just do like somebody did
[14:22] one time and I was in a place and then
[14:26] this brother was preaching away and I
[14:28] mention it to the sister later and I
[14:31] said sister I said she was running all
[14:34] over the place yeah I said that man was
[14:36] preaching an error
[14:42] well she left the church never came back
[14:48] well it was still right I mean was I
[14:52] mean and hateful to try to correct
[14:55] somebody and love to get us to see but
[15:04] you see it's so easy to take Satan's lie
[15:09] upon the Word of God so you get into all
[15:16] kind of things well we don't need to
[15:18] know this we don't need to know that
[15:19] who's telling you that sure ain't God
[15:26] right God wrote it God preached it
[15:30] through the Prophet you mean we're not
[15:31] to understand it
[15:34] certainly not in yeah we don't want to
[15:38] believe the devil is able to do it we
[15:41] don't to fool us
[15:44] yeah and now listen here's the point of
[15:48] tonight if it's correct that it was only
[15:55] one word that brought all of the sin in
[16:00] things into the world and death and all
[16:04] the things and the Prophet says we're
[16:07] not going back with one sin so now I
[16:15] don't know problems were saying that's
[16:18] the reason we've been here 50 years
[16:19] after the prophets been gone I don't
[16:23] have no problem with that do you well
[16:26] we're just waiting on you brother day
[16:28] well pray for me all right
[16:31] that's the best way to say it ain't
[16:36] nobody throwing those stones or pointing
[16:38] no fingers it's just trying to tell the
[16:40] truth the same devil that got Eve that
[16:50] run said got the Old Testament ride Joe
[16:55] is right
[16:56] now it was alright go to spawn words
[16:58] regional seat he said in that same lie
[17:06] got Jesus's bride yeah but I don't think
[17:11] that I don't think Jesus is brother you
[17:17] just accepted Satan's lie come on you
[17:25] just accepted Satan's lie cuz your
[17:29] prophets if you did then you need the
[17:36] quotes you need you see how easy it is
[17:43] to fall into unbelief as I said now if
[17:48] it's just one thing they brought us out
[17:51] then are we going back with a whole
[17:54] bunch of wrongs no we're going back when
[18:04] the bride comes to the basis that she
[18:06] gets rid of all of her unbelief and quit
[18:10] sake quit taking Satan's lie yeah but
[18:13] brothers knowing so honey did this with
[18:16] the Prophet and he was done and the
[18:19] Prophet or dying him in the ministry I
[18:25] heard of a church one time the pastor of
[18:29] the church said I can't not let that man
[18:33] preach brother Branham ordained him know
[18:39] how much unbelief is that right just a
[18:46] simple little thought of unbelief not a
[18:53] great big got Landy's wrong to do in
[18:56] this out of the other just to doubt what
[19:00] the Prophet said
[19:07] see that's why he was the one that said
[19:09] it when are we gonna start putting our
[19:16] whole life on what he said oh I do
[19:19] brother Dale I've got everything I've
[19:27] got on this I say it this way I got
[19:32] everything I know based upon it oh you
[19:40] think you own you
[19:41] usually I will stand with you on any
[19:46] discussion of the message as to anything
[19:50] the Prophet taught me but I'm honest
[19:53] enough to say and truthful enough to
[19:57] believe that Satan but around says no
[20:02] man is a match for the devil is that his
[20:08] word
[20:09] so now let's don't say what I wanted to
[20:12] delegate to see me I know bless God the
[20:14] Bible says about see that I can't be
[20:17] deceived I know where the Prophet said
[20:19] that but didn't what about the others
[20:21] you don't want to quote all of it do you
[20:24] you don't want to quote word run around
[20:26] and said frankly he'd get the bride so
[20:30] messed up they'd have to cut the work
[20:32] short you remember that
[20:42] see we want to we take what we want we
[20:48] don't walk the whole message we take
[20:51] what we want and make the rest of it our
[20:54] thoughts and ideas right now see then to
[21:03] listen to Satan's lie in the same way
[21:08] that Eve listened brains you and I to
[21:15] the same place where she was at what did
[21:28] he do what was her problem she wanted
[21:35] wisdom she wanted to understand Satan
[21:38] told her said that's what she's made far
[21:41] and that's what God said she's made far
[21:47] but it was just the wrong way that she
[21:51] manifested it right she was made to be a
[21:56] mother
[21:58] everything but it was the wrong way to
[22:01] make that manifest so then it's not to
[22:08] be so far off it's just to be one word
[22:14] off to doubt one word of the prophets
[22:19] message would that not be death as well
[22:23] as to doubt any part of the Bible then
[22:27] we're not stupid maybe a little dumb an
[22:30] idiot's but not totally I know when the
[22:35] Prophet taught things they were not
[22:38] correct so do you my horse rider this is
[22:47] one illustration all right now we don't
[22:51] go on that
[22:53] so when I say that to doubt anything the
[22:56] Prophet taught I'm not laying it on that
[23:01] form of doing good even he would make a
[23:07] statement one time he said the black and
[23:11] white will fight again and die like
[23:13] flies you remember that everybody had to
[23:20] dust at the Lord's but one day we found
[23:28] where the Prophet said believes the next
[23:31] message after then he said that was my
[23:33] idea
[23:37] well now you can prop up all you want to
[23:41] and say we'll look at the black and the
[23:43] white fighting around the world in the
[23:46] Prophet being right we don't have to
[23:48] prop up the prophets message you don't
[23:54] have to prove to me that the Prophet was
[23:56] right that's what I told brother mote
[24:01] when he began to talk to him but I said
[24:03] listen you saw these things did you
[24:11] solve the healings of signs and wonders
[24:14] the dead raised and I believe he but I
[24:20] said you don't have to prove that to me
[24:22] I see you tell me what he taught now
[24:25] this is a good old bad dish I said you
[24:28] tell me what he taught in the Word of
[24:34] God I won't have no problems whether or
[24:40] not he was a prophet what about a good
[24:44] old badness that we was back behind at
[24:48] least a message or two between us and
[24:51] you Pentecostals but had enough
[24:56] understanding of the word of God to
[24:58] simply put my whole talks on one basis
[25:01] tell me what he taught
[25:07] and I knew for certainty that he didn't
[25:11] teach the Trinity I've done been through
[25:14] that and got that took out of the way
[25:18] then brother mote said you're this you
[25:20] that that he said you're he's like all
[25:24] the rest in Trinitarians I said don't
[25:26] believe that no more you understand I
[25:30] thought the two bride of Jesus Christ
[25:35] was supposed to take the Word of God
[25:40] over everything and believe what he's
[25:47] saying we read it there the other day
[25:50] was it when it sold in prison we read it
[25:52] just the other day I believe that's
[25:53] right
[25:54] it was in the last message what around
[25:57] said this bride would prove to Satan
[26:01] that she would not be deceived like even
[26:09] now that's pretty strong in it yeah
[26:13] she'll be deceived like Eve was she's
[26:17] got a lot of problems
[26:17] yeah she's not gonna be deceived because
[26:23] she's gonna take God's Word and believe
[26:27] it okay because see the reason I believe
[26:30] it thataway
[26:31] I believe if a prophet is a prophet now
[26:35] that's for you to think about a worry
[26:38] about if a prophet is a prophet then
[26:43] he's the one the word comes to is that
[26:47] what a mystery in three Niner or what it
[26:51] is
[26:57] see then you and I have no right to
[27:01] question a prophets word upon what basis
[27:09] can you do well you just said he was
[27:12] wrong on the wild horse rider yeah and
[27:15] he corrected it you know what nobody
[27:19] else in the world correct right I don't
[27:25] care if it was Clarence Larkin Wavell
[27:28] for brother Branham I said the white
[27:30] horse rider with the Antichrist I didn't
[27:33] correct the Prophet is it true that
[27:37] brother Branham said a prophet stands
[27:39] before no one is that his word so then
[27:49] what took place when as I said the devil
[27:58] was quoting the Word of God to Eve he
[28:07] said she was made for the purpose he was
[28:12] made to produce he gave her the
[28:18] scriptures the Prophet said that was an
[28:23] oncoming thing but then we know what
[28:28] happened senator sin entered the picture
[28:34] what took place back there then brother
[28:40] Brennan says God put man on co-equal
[28:46] with him making him co-equal paragraph
[28:53] 132 133 power of transformation put them
[28:57] equal with him so they could choose what
[29:03] about that
[29:07] well he made a Miku right there now what
[29:10] is he talking about he gave him a choice
[29:17] they made a choice and when they made
[29:25] the choice the woman made the first
[29:28] wrong choice
[29:32] No and when she did right around since
[29:36] she become a great preacher because she
[29:42] began to tell the devil about the Word
[29:45] of God when run said she can be a
[29:54] thousand let's see let me get this one
[29:57] cuz I sometimes I'll make a statement
[30:00] and when I do you know people who come
[30:03] up and say wait a minute words that off
[30:11] the message adoption the run said and
[30:17] you women nothing I gave him this but
[30:20] they don't have to put it up said he
[30:23] made you as a target and certainly has
[30:25] been made a target out of your sisters
[30:28] he just does that see cuz he knows what
[30:33] he can do as much a devil he can deceive
[30:38] a woman a thousand times quicker than a
[30:42] man you say well you're throwing off on
[30:49] the women I've always been the one that
[30:52] stood up for the women so you going to
[30:55] make a balance or what you think she
[31:00] wasn't made any differ
[31:06] if she was didn't God was wrong to make
[31:09] her that away but why would it be that
[31:16] she could be a thousand times easier
[31:17] deceived because she ain't smartest bush
[31:25] men that's wonderful
[31:28] I'm glad you thought of that of course
[31:32] it's wrong but you thought of it didn't
[31:34] know what she was deceived but we wasn't
[31:39] deceived
[31:41] well I will remind you the Bible says
[31:44] that the Prophet declares it and he says
[31:47] this Adam knew exactly what he was doing
[31:50] that's what it means that he was not
[31:53] deceived but you know what he did walk
[32:00] out of the garden he did partake of the
[32:03] things and do and I will remind you the
[32:11] Bible also says that in Adam all died
[32:17] doesn't say you Nev in Adam all died
[32:21] because if Adam hadn't sold the human
[32:23] race see we just make a quote and we
[32:31] make it for a purpose of something of
[32:35] our own doings instead of trying to
[32:39] explain that we just lump it out well
[32:45] huh then you say something well I I
[32:47] don't know but I just say what the
[32:50] Prophet said yeah you remember he said
[32:58] and you go do likewise you remember that
[33:03] but listen
[33:08] think about preachers because ended the
[33:17] message up Sunday you can talk about
[33:21] free moral agency to the ministers of
[33:23] this message and they'll tell you real
[33:26] quick free moral agency is not for the
[33:28] bride no if I knew I'd wake up sometimes
[33:40] and what you listen to the preachers of
[33:49] this message was the biggest basics of
[33:51] them preach is that God chose you you
[33:56] didn't fuse him okay mister truth but it
[34:03] says that we don't deal on whosoever
[34:06] will that means for the world that's
[34:08] four denominations that's four foolish
[34:10] virgins is not for you and me but around
[34:14] them said I'm glad it didn't say William
[34:16] Branham he said I'm glad it said
[34:18] whosoever will he said called it might
[34:21] be another William Branham somewhere you
[34:23] remember that what you see we think we
[34:29] know all about it and then the preachers
[34:33] take it to the pulpit and teach their
[34:36] people and the people come out of it
[34:38] swearing by the things that are saying
[34:42] which is not right
[34:50] is that not the same thing it was in the
[34:52] garden to Eve
[34:56] they've got 99% word a lot of time but a
[35:02] 1% dog can kill the whole thing come on
[35:09] Eve was made for the purpose of being a
[35:14] mother what your prophet said he was
[35:18] commissioned multiply and replenish the
[35:21] earth she was promised are we quote in
[35:26] brother Brandon
[35:27] yet do we believe it that way or do we
[35:30] have to some way now to try to PT patter
[35:33] around just a little bit to kind of
[35:35] sideline the top instead of saying Amen
[35:44] what do you think you're the only ones
[35:46] got the truth I don't mind making
[35:48] statements after you make them you make
[35:52] a statement like that I don't mind
[35:53] saying I'm the only one I noticed got
[35:55] the truth now may I quote brother
[36:04] Brandon can you say that why can't you
[36:14] say that you're the only one this got
[36:17] the truth I thought the Prophet said
[36:24] there's only one going out of state of
[36:26] Georgia you know he didn't use Georgia
[36:30] he is Tennessee or something you know
[36:34] see that's how quick and smart that
[36:36] people are you know you say brother
[36:38] Brown said there's only one out of state
[36:42] of Georgia he didn't say Georgia
[36:45] he said Tennessee boy straightens you
[36:49] out
[36:49] they've got you all you know
[36:58] but what about the people of the message
[37:02] don't even believe in free moral agency
[37:10] when the Prophet said that was what it
[37:12] was it was not free moral agency what
[37:23] would he turn out to be let's read this
[37:27] one well look number one brothers on you
[37:30] think not 180 now number one it's called
[37:34] a prisoner number one is called a
[37:40] prisoner
[37:47] all right that's 1a I told no one that
[37:51] cerfancy learning a different one well
[37:55] let's read that when we got it up
[37:57] there's what I said it want to go see
[37:59] that's where brother Branham says that
[38:01] Satan has a knowledge so then watch what
[38:03] he gives that where I gave what I go now
[38:05] I went and that's from serpent seed Owen
[38:09] got the dictionary today ever ever were
[38:12] to look up this word what the word
[38:14] subtour meant it means to be smart to be
[38:18] crafty and the best interpretation of
[38:22] the of the hebrew form mah aah
[38:28] maja means having a true knowledge of
[38:32] the principles of life Satan has a true
[38:39] knowledge of the principles of life he
[38:43] knew what would mix and what would not
[38:45] mix he had it all down and that's what
[38:50] the word sub talk now he has a knowledge
[38:54] of the principles of life it doesn't
[38:57] just mean that this egg will go with
[38:59] this sperm right we're in a smart very
[39:07] intelligent age that we've went from in
[39:11] 50 years from a horse and buggy almost
[39:18] to a astronaut going through space and
[39:22] turned to the basis to this almost the
[39:26] Bible said that the imagination of man's
[39:28] heart was continually evil and look what
[39:31] we're doing it's so intelligent man
[39:37] until it's just amazing that's the
[39:40] knowledge of the principles of life
[39:43] Satan has that knowledge he knows what's
[39:48] going and taking place we just remember
[39:52] God is higher than that but think about
[39:56] it all right go ahead now let's get the
[39:59] 1 on the prison
[40:01] under the next huh it's a prisoner they
[40:06] were all born a free moral agent to make
[40:09] any decision that we wish to God just
[40:13] God justly does that because he must put
[40:17] ever man on the same basis or he put the
[40:23] wrong man he put the first man on the
[40:26] wrong basis if everybody's not to sign
[40:30] listen he put on free moral agency
[40:36] we're just exactly - not like Adam and
[40:39] Eve there's no different right and wrong
[40:43] sets before either one of us wrote it or
[40:50] not now listen but see if it's free
[40:56] moral agency let's see if everybody's on
[40:59] the same basis notice he took us without
[41:08] the same way then what notice if he took
[41:12] us without the same way did he did Adam
[41:15] where would you be if he didn't give you
[41:18] the same cause you understand that's
[41:21] what he said if he took us without the
[41:24] sign that he did Adam and he just pulled
[41:26] us through something said I'll save you
[41:31] whether you want to be saved or not then
[41:38] he put Adam and Eve on the wrong basis
[41:40] because he didn't tell them that are you
[41:45] reading but each of us has to choose
[41:47] this day between death and life read
[41:49] what he's saying if he said now - you
[41:57] see that's where all of this messages in
[42:00] the message people you know I come into
[42:01] world with eternal life gets out of the
[42:03] other so if he says to you I'll save you
[42:09] whether you want to be saved or not
[42:14] how close is that statement because he
[42:18] gave Abraham an unconditional covenant
[42:29] do you understand so if he just pulled
[42:34] it through something said I'll save you
[42:35] where do you want to be save enough then
[42:37] he put Adam and Eve on the wrong basis
[42:39] listen Adam and Eve was not put on the
[42:45] basis of you do anything you won't do
[42:49] and I'll save you anyway right Adam and
[42:56] Eve was put on the basis if you keep my
[43:00] word but if you doubt one word you're
[43:05] lost something happened to Abraham when
[43:12] you come over to him and he said I'll
[43:15] give you an unconditional covenant we'll
[43:18] get to that Adam and Eve didn't have an
[43:23] unconditional cover
[43:27] come on the first beginning two people
[43:31] didn't have an unconditional covenant
[43:33] that's what he's explaining he's
[43:38] explaining if he just throw it out and
[43:40] say I'll save you whether you want or
[43:43] not
[43:43] he said that was not what he said to
[43:46] Adam Adam and Eve was on a conditional
[43:54] covenant right if you will I will
[44:00] something had to take place in God to
[44:06] move it to Abraham and that's probably
[44:09] three thousand years between the Adam
[44:14] and Eve and Abraham so more close
[44:22] before he ever told anybody anything
[44:25] about an unconditional covenant so
[44:33] you'll understand what I'm talking about
[44:34] Lord willing Sunday you got a have a
[44:36] salvation in the Old Testament what is
[44:45] it and how did it work
[44:55] you not only had a Salvation in the
[44:57] hotel you had a place to go to to prove
[45:01] there was a Salvation the ones that
[45:07] called the bosom of Abraham think about
[45:18] it to each and every one of us has a
[45:24] choice you can't do away with the choice
[45:29] well he chose me I didn't choose them
[45:32] see you've taken that totally out of
[45:34] text out of thought God never had a
[45:39] thought he's just explaining that dark
[45:41] if he'd done that to you without
[45:45] something happening then he was wrong to
[45:48] Adam and Eve cuz they'd done one thing
[45:52] wrong got condemned we got a long ways
[45:56] to go but listen what happened to Eve
[46:05] that was her problem well she doubted
[46:13] God's Word okay that was original sin
[46:17] right
[46:23] but do we believe the profit that run
[46:30] since she began to reason she began to
[46:34] listen to reason
[46:41] Satan is successful with reasoning
[46:47] reasoning now so yours were we're gonna
[46:58] separate this little bit a little
[47:00] understanding what was the original sin
[47:12] unbelief unbelief and that God would not
[47:24] keep his word when he said you shall die
[47:29] but around said she doubted Hebrews 13:8
[47:33] so that means simply that she doubted
[47:36] him to keep his word then are now do you
[47:42] believe God is able to keep his word
[47:53] do you doubt any of the things to profit
[47:56] tall
[48:06] can you put everything you got on what
[48:08] he said as I said while ago as much as
[48:14] you know okay I don't mind talking like
[48:18] that what about this fall that took
[48:27] place to Adam and Eve where did it take
[48:35] place the literal act took place in the
[48:42] body we understand that word did the
[48:53] reasoning upon God's Word come from and
[48:57] wort took place and where was it at see
[49:06] I knew I was gonna preach this about
[49:07] three months ago when I was in - trying
[49:11] to get you to see that Adam fell from
[49:13] eternal life
[49:15] what's prophecy to death but now Adam
[49:22] didn't die in his soul even when he was
[49:29] so many hundred years old
[49:30] I mean why we're talking about the other
[49:34] day it's kind of funny I got thinking
[49:35] about that the other day night sit down
[49:37] read there in Genesis and read the
[49:40] account and you know it started out that
[49:43] them fellers and that feller did 150
[49:47] years old or 200 years old before he
[49:49] ever had a child lived to be 700 years
[49:55] old or something
[49:57] 969 for Methuselah he'd have a couple of
[50:02] kids maybe
[50:02] I mean it's courting what records now
[50:06] but I got to do it and I knew it would
[50:08] do so I got to do it I got to looking
[50:10] and I thought Lord and I know where this
[50:13] is gonna wind up and I still won't read
[50:15] it so I just read and I'd read about so
[50:20] and so live so how long and we got a
[50:23] child look and it'd be 150 years old and
[50:39] I got to looking and reading and I knew
[50:41] it would happen so I I just followed the
[50:44] line to get reading so it started out
[50:46] like the first one was a 175 years old
[50:49] fort sky was born
[50:52] next one 160 next 150 next 140 next 100
[50:59] next it got to drop and down he's I'm
[51:10] just making a point we read the Word of
[51:15] God but do we really analyze it and
[51:17] think about it the mission
[51:25] it went on for close to 2,000 years
[51:29] before they ever dropped low enough to
[51:31] get a baby born into 80 years old come
[51:41] on Abraham was what 80 something when
[51:49] then he waited 16 what have anymore
[51:52] years 16 years old would it then he
[51:55] wound up waiting for Isaac to come along
[52:01] but we don't read the word to believe it
[52:04] we read the words it's not a figure out
[52:06] taste must be something wrong here I
[52:10] mean did it take them 150 years to learn
[52:14] how to have children I don't understand
[52:20] it it you say well what's your point my
[52:27] point is the same thing of the message
[52:30] we try to figure it out instead of just
[52:32] accepting it
[52:35] God said the tailee of that many years
[52:39] before they had any children well
[52:43] there's no need of us sitting down
[52:44] trying to figure it out why it happened
[52:47] that way
[52:48] we just believe it and say thank you
[52:53] lord
[52:58] why can't we believe it about the entire
[53:01] Word of God they remember what we taught
[53:06] a few months ago in read from brother
[53:11] Branham where brother Branham said
[53:15] blasphemous names that God breathed into
[53:19] the nostrils of Adam eternal life and he
[53:24] became an eternal person with God the
[53:28] Son of God
[53:33] then we went to the breach were brought
[53:36] around and said when Adam died he said
[53:40] but before he died he had a lamb know
[53:46] what died where was the original sin
[53:55] well it was unbelief where's that at
[53:58] we're done believe that may I quote
[54:04] brother Branham God chose men's heart he
[54:14] said Satan chose his brain her mind the
[54:20] right do you remember that message
[54:29] well I just didn't believe it brother
[54:32] Dale because I couldn't understand it
[54:38] did the Prophet say it you needs me to
[54:43] read it again from Blasius night where
[54:48] he said he breathed into the nostrils of
[54:49] Adam and he became a living soul he said
[54:57] an eternal person with God that was Adam
[55:02] and remember in the Genesis 1:26 account
[55:13] that Adam and Eve was in the same
[55:18] theophany that's what's your prophet
[55:21] said in questions and answers he said he
[55:25] was in Adam and theophany and he said
[55:28] she was still up in in theophany after
[55:31] Adam was put in the flesh then God took
[55:37] a rib out of Adam made Eve and then God
[55:42] put that theophany in that I'm into Eve
[55:49] did we believe that but that's worth I
[55:54] just don't understand you you starting
[55:56] Adam and Eve it off with eternal off I
[55:59] didn't write the book you know what I
[56:04] mean by that I mean I wasn't
[56:08] appreciators at it
[56:09] I wasn't the Prophet that said it I
[56:12] didn't have enough sense to say it and
[56:15] you didn't either when a prophet would
[56:19] tell us that Adam and Eve fell in body
[56:26] from becoming eternal in human flesh but
[56:31] they never fail in their soul
[56:36] now you say they did within I want the
[56:39] prophets message the main thing I wanted
[56:43] is that God's an Indian giver I want you
[56:46] to explain that better unsaid he's not
[56:50] that he's not an Indian giver you don't
[56:52] give you something take it back how can
[56:54] he give you eternal life how could he
[56:56] give Adam and Eve eternal life and then
[56:58] take it away from them it wasn't he
[57:04] ternal life that he took from Adam and
[57:08] Eve it was the fact that they never came
[57:12] to eternal life in human flesh one of
[57:16] these days you realize why the seals got
[57:17] to be preached and you begin to see
[57:21] Redemption you're gonna line up one time
[57:26] you're gonna see that those seals
[57:28] I thought brother branham said that all
[57:35] Adam lost Jesus Christ
[57:40] Reidy is that what he said so then Jesus
[57:50] Christ redeemed it and made a way for us
[57:58] to come to a change of the body but yet
[58:01] we don't want to know what the seals are
[58:03] you know why it is go we're afraid
[58:06] afraid of what afraid the devil might
[58:10] deceive us you are already deceived when
[58:14] you do not want the things the Prophet
[58:17] brought unto us I don't care who it is
[58:22] you may family anybody you're already
[58:27] deceived when you don't want what would
[58:29] take you out of here to change us
[58:37] she didn't my point I didn't bring it
[58:40] out back there because I was waiting
[58:41] then here Adam and Eve never failed to
[58:49] death spiritually I want the passage I
[58:56] want the Bible but they failed a
[59:01] physical death right the prophets right
[59:09] he said they fell from eternal life what
[59:12] they never come to eternal life in flesh
[59:22] even Jesus the body had to be made
[59:28] eternal to show you where Adam fell from
[59:38] Adam was standing there with eternal
[59:40] life in his soul but a body that your
[59:45] prophet said that his youth was being
[59:49] renewed daily the de Tree of Life was
[59:52] standing there reminding him of that
[59:54] because his body was not eternal Jesus's
[59:57] body was not eternal it had to be made
[1:00:01] eternal in the resurrection not the
[1:00:05] saint chance whatever you want to bring
[1:00:11] you see standing back there three or
[1:00:13] four months ago knowing I'd have to come
[1:00:14] to this place to get us to think about
[1:00:27] were was to fall in even Adam
[1:00:39] it wasn't in body that would have been
[1:00:44] an attribute or a display that was not
[1:00:48] to see him the atom could not sin in his
[1:00:55] soul because it was eternal come on Adam
[1:01:06] could sin in its own code it so was
[1:01:07] eternal Jesus Christ couldn't sin in his
[1:01:10] soul because his soul was eternal no
[1:01:13] born-again believer can send in your
[1:01:15] soul that's why it's vital to understand
[1:01:19] the difference between soul and spirit
[1:01:27] it's vital to understand because only
[1:01:31] through that can you see what happened
[1:01:34] to Adam and Eve is the same thing that's
[1:01:37] happening tonight if you have eternal
[1:01:41] life
[1:01:41] your soul is sealed in with Almighty God
[1:01:45] and you can never lose that right our
[1:01:52] bodies we know he's not worth anything
[1:02:00] which you'll see then what happened in
[1:02:03] the garden I mean brother Branham said
[1:02:05] God chose the heart right
[1:02:16] he said Satan chose the head what deals
[1:02:22] through your head when I was Paul so
[1:02:29] concerned with born-again Christians had
[1:02:37] the new book or the Bible not written to
[1:02:39] sinner's and I it's written to
[1:02:41] Christians and he's talking to
[1:02:45] Christians here in Corinthians and
[1:02:47] telling them
[1:02:50] that I was struggled and said it's been
[1:02:54] foolishness to the world and the thing
[1:02:56] was said through that and I've tried to
[1:03:00] bring the word to people he said a bride
[1:03:07] he said it wouldn't be deceived as Eve
[1:03:11] was deceived through the subtlety now is
[1:03:17] that not the same thing that the Prophet
[1:03:19] said he said this bride would prove to
[1:03:23] Satan that she would not fall for
[1:03:30] Satan's lie somebody is going to stand
[1:03:34] and believe it so we begin to reason
[1:03:42] words reasoning at what you see here is
[1:03:52] where we stand in the critical situation
[1:04:00] and yet I've been ridiculed for trying
[1:04:04] to explain something that's very serious
[1:04:10] the Prophet told in his early ministry
[1:04:14] basically this time here in are related
[1:04:17] basically divided into our early
[1:04:19] ministry he thought a three round person
[1:04:24] body soul and spirit
[1:04:36] that's good go on check it out I've got
[1:04:39] him laying you're the only reader but in
[1:04:42] it when he comes in along into the
[1:04:44] opening of the seals and coming on
[1:04:48] through after really is when the quotes
[1:04:50] become to develop he preaches a try on
[1:04:54] being as body spirit and soul well I
[1:05:02] don't make no difference why is it two
[1:05:10] people of this message your two so
[1:05:12] people all told him said the soul is
[1:05:15] just the nature of the spirit and I
[1:05:17] challenge anybody on that to show me
[1:05:19] where right around and said the soul is
[1:05:20] just the nature of the spirit he didn't
[1:05:23] say it he said the soul is the nature of
[1:05:25] the spirit he said your technical plenty
[1:05:28] technical when my life is involved I'm
[1:05:30] plenty technical if you say it's just
[1:05:35] that this means it's nothing if you
[1:05:37] don't make no difference
[1:05:39] his early ministry I ask you to go back
[1:05:42] in the read let's pull that up let's do
[1:05:46] it brothers because a lot of people's
[1:05:48] never seen it they've never studied the
[1:05:52] message from a thought to where they
[1:05:56] could see that a prophet in the way he
[1:06:01] would teach things until the word opened
[1:06:08] was brother branham wrong when he was
[1:06:10] teaching body soul and spirit when later
[1:06:18] he taught body spirit and soul now
[1:06:24] before you jump up and run off and
[1:06:26] people on the internet and do it just
[1:06:28] remember one time brother branham always
[1:06:31] taught her trying being has three parts
[1:06:35] number one is a body the CTA's feeling
[1:06:39] smelling here number two whatever you
[1:06:43] call it spirit or soul he always taught
[1:06:46] it as memory reason conscience
[1:06:49] affections etc he always taught the
[1:06:54] sinner realm of mankind has to be the
[1:06:58] occupation of the holy spirit or God
[1:07:01] dwelling you he never changed his
[1:07:07] message so he didn't have to correct it
[1:07:12] he said well you can't find what brought
[1:07:15] around correct is that that's what I
[1:07:17] mean whether he knew the way that
[1:07:22] happened or what I have no problem I
[1:07:26] just know for a certain and I can go
[1:07:30] back in the 50s and talk about her
[1:07:33] trying being when the Prophet would call
[1:07:38] him body so second rent spirit sent
[1:07:42] around I can shout hallelujah because
[1:07:46] he'll always explain the census he
[1:07:50] always explained the census of the body
[1:07:54] the outside ring she takes field
[1:07:57] smelling here you always explain that
[1:07:59] second rim as memory reason conscience
[1:08:03] affections etc he always talked the
[1:08:07] center part of mankind as the place
[1:08:10] where God would come and live what do
[1:08:15] you think I was quoting from their will
[1:08:19] ago when brother Adam talks about God's
[1:08:21] approaches to heart
[1:08:25] Satan's approach is the head has taken
[1:08:29] from 1961 101 revelations chapter 461
[1:08:39] okay
[1:08:44] Intervale 1965 excuse me he's talking
[1:08:52] about the outer rim to enter him and he
[1:08:57] calls the second rim that's what he says
[1:09:00] right down in the heart in the center of
[1:09:03] the heart there's a little compartment
[1:09:07] where there's not even a blood cell in
[1:09:10] it it's not in the animal heart only in
[1:09:14] the human heart and they say it's the
[1:09:17] occupation or the occupant of the soul
[1:09:22] the soul lives in the heart he knew
[1:09:26] exactly what he's talking about but yet
[1:09:30] you go backwards and forth the soul
[1:09:34] spirit and body so but that's not
[1:09:38] important where's your born-again
[1:09:41] experience
[1:09:46] is it in your body
[1:09:48] not exactly is it in your spirit you can
[1:09:53] be anointed every day you live in your
[1:09:55] spirit with the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:57] Spirit in dying go to hell is that the
[1:10:02] words of the Prophet but he said that
[1:10:08] soul bless Venus names God breathed into
[1:10:13] the nostrils of Adam and he became a
[1:10:16] living soul he says there a soul that
[1:10:20] can't die you see the reason people
[1:10:27] don't want this I've done it in seven
[1:10:30] he's doing it now because you destroy
[1:10:33] the doctrine of the two souls it's
[1:10:39] destroyed by the Word of God that shows
[1:10:42] you the body and the second realm is the
[1:10:47] spirit realm reasoning memory conscious
[1:10:50] in the soul is the center in the place
[1:10:53] of God the two sold people said he
[1:10:56] give you a new soul Ezekiel says what I
[1:11:00] know word words new heart in your spirit
[1:11:06] brother Brennan said that I need to hold
[1:11:08] his spirit he said then I put my life in
[1:11:14] you and my soul in you he said now you
[1:11:17] got eternal life you see Church the
[1:11:26] little bitty things is what spoiling the
[1:11:29] vine of the people of this message what
[1:11:34] does it matter okay
[1:11:38] you gonna baptize father son Holy Ghost
[1:11:41] next time what does it matter it's in
[1:11:44] the Word of God right I told you we get
[1:11:59] down to an that part of it being look
[1:12:01] what he gets on the rapture message
[1:12:03] number nine if you don't pull that up
[1:12:06] look here you're a trying being you are
[1:12:11] inside this little fella here it's the
[1:12:13] soul he's coming inside out what's it
[1:12:16] the next is the spirit and next is the
[1:12:21] body
[1:12:22] you got five senses in the body to
[1:12:25] contact earthly home you don't contact
[1:12:28] the rest of it you got five senses of
[1:12:31] the Spirit there love conscious and so
[1:12:35] forth but in here is where you live
[1:12:38] that's what you gon that's why you can
[1:12:44] be anointed on your spirit and still be
[1:12:46] lost with the born-again experience
[1:12:50] we'll get to it later look at the next
[1:12:53] one number ten god of this evil age that
[1:12:57] man is a physical being which is
[1:12:59] controlled by six senses or five senses
[1:13:02] brother inside man is the spirit man
[1:13:05] which is controlled by five senses
[1:13:08] conscious and loved and so forth
[1:13:10] yeah outside man see taste feel smell in
[1:13:12] here but the inside of that spirit is a
[1:13:16] soul and it's controlled by one thing
[1:13:19] your free will your free will read the
[1:13:31] profit you can accept what the devil
[1:13:37] says or accept what God says in that'll
[1:13:42] determine what spirit is in there if
[1:13:46] it's the Spirit of God it'll feed on the
[1:13:49] things of God and it won't feed on
[1:13:53] anything of the world jesus said you
[1:13:58] loved the world as the things of the
[1:13:59] world it's because the love of God is
[1:14:03] not even entered this inner part inner
[1:14:08] part he said was the soul see why you
[1:14:14] can be anointed I know they don't have
[1:14:16] this one but the message that North it
[1:14:18] not paragraph 123 124 you talking about
[1:14:25] the endless he said I don't know what I
[1:14:28] can call him right or not at first
[1:14:30] I know is all conscious what watch what
[1:14:34] he says no conscious livery and he's
[1:14:36] correcting his own self no watch there
[1:14:38] is five inlets to the spirit you can't
[1:14:43] think with your body you have to think
[1:14:46] with your spirit you can't have
[1:14:49] conscience in your body it has no mental
[1:14:53] faculties at all your body doesn't so
[1:14:57] you have to think with your spirit
[1:14:59] you have to reason you cannot reason
[1:15:01] with your physical being
[1:15:03] because reasoning doesn't see taste feel
[1:15:05] smelling hear reason is what you can
[1:15:08] make in your mind and if you are sleep
[1:15:13] or not if you're asleep or at you're out
[1:15:18] your body's land are dead but your
[1:15:22] spirit can still read
[1:15:25] there is five senses that controls that
[1:15:29] inside man now the life man which is the
[1:15:33] soul there is only one sense that
[1:15:37] controls that look you remember free
[1:15:41] will hold on the other and what does he
[1:15:44] say
[1:15:44] and that is free moral agency free will
[1:15:50] to choose are to reject what about it
[1:15:56] Church what what does it matter where
[1:16:00] it's so spirit of body why does it
[1:16:02] matter
[1:16:08] it matters because your word won't line
[1:16:10] up then may I quote one scripture why do
[1:16:14] you think better run late so every when
[1:16:16] he rude what at fourth well what does
[1:16:19] that one say the word divides between
[1:16:26] the joint and Amara in between the soul
[1:16:31] and the spirit you can be anointed on
[1:16:39] that spirit of reasoning and that's what
[1:16:42] he was now listen I'm gonna end with
[1:16:48] this top eve was anointed on her
[1:16:52] reasoning on her spirit realm
[1:16:59] Satan contacted that and talked to her
[1:17:04] and gave her a great understanding in
[1:17:09] her spirit realm had she listened to
[1:17:14] Adam it wouldn't have happened had she
[1:17:17] listened to her own inner being he said
[1:17:24] well why are you bringing it that way
[1:17:26] because that's exactly where we're
[1:17:28] sitting tonight you are making a choice
[1:17:33] as to whether or not
[1:17:36] you believe the Word of God blew me
[1:17:41] brother I believe there were so did Eve
[1:17:46] I'm quoting brother branham she believed
[1:17:49] everything he said that God said except
[1:17:56] what Satan began to interpret even our
[1:18:01] spirit realm became the first one to be
[1:18:08] anointed now remember Satan can anoint
[1:18:15] you that run but brother Branham didn't
[1:18:24] if it didn't divide that as much as the
[1:18:27] basis that he put the anointing as being
[1:18:30] even the genuine holy spirit how can you
[1:18:35] be anointed with the Holy Spirit and
[1:18:37] deny the word well I'm glad you thought
[1:18:41] of that may I ask you a question his
[1:18:47] weight was saying the other day about on
[1:18:49] Caiaphas standing up their high priest
[1:18:54] the Bible says the high priest is under
[1:18:59] the anointing of the time that even saw
[1:19:03] under the anointing could prophesy all
[1:19:06] kind of things happen under the
[1:19:07] anointing Caiaphas could anoint and
[1:19:14] Caiaphas spoke the word he said it was
[1:19:18] necessary read your Bible that one died
[1:19:21] for the sins of the people instead of
[1:19:23] all the people who died that was exactly
[1:19:25] the Old Testament prophecy the calf was
[1:19:27] said Balaam
[1:19:31] anointed he's writing his writing is in
[1:19:36] the Bible
[1:19:40] baylin's words is in the Bible the
[1:19:48] anointing of the Holy Spirit was on Eve
[1:19:57] to teach her you say but God would
[1:20:02] deliberately do it
[1:20:03] no the anointing was on her that she
[1:20:06] couldn't tell the difference between
[1:20:08] when Satan was talking to her or when
[1:20:11] God was talking to her you tell me come
[1:20:17] on
[1:20:17] we done gone too far she couldn't tell
[1:20:20] the difference why brother Brown says
[1:20:25] she still thinks she's right why because
[1:20:30] she's anointed he said anointed with a
[1:20:33] genuine holy spirit and still be lost
[1:20:42] that's why Catholics remember what way
[1:20:44] were talking about see John was told
[1:20:46] when he was in the wilderness when you
[1:20:49] see the Holy Ghost descending but the
[1:20:54] key was is what he told John he said and
[1:20:57] remaining on him John walks after her
[1:20:59] one day and he hears koffice he sees him
[1:21:01] in the temple he's walking around
[1:21:03] watching him cough there's an anointing
[1:21:04] of the Spirit of God Caiaphas is
[1:21:07] prophesy all kinds of things is
[1:21:09] happening under koffice the guy that
[1:21:12] killed Jesus John says what's going on
[1:21:20] the guard said but John don't you
[1:21:22] remember what I told you I told you
[1:21:25] there'd be anointings I said I told you
[1:21:29] the key he said the one that the Holy
[1:21:32] Spirit descends on and remains you come
[1:21:43] on him and remained only
[1:21:49] we'll know gutsy now culture prophet
[1:21:51] said the anointing left he said
[1:21:53] anointing left
[1:21:54] he didn't say God left him his spirit
[1:21:59] never left out of him
[1:22:03] it was the anointing the priests just
[1:22:06] what left him because that was the
[1:22:07] anointing they come on him on the River
[1:22:09] Jordan to start his ministry come on we
[1:22:13] got it right John looks and he says
[1:22:18] caucus is confusing me but God said
[1:22:21] remember now watch and he saw that one
[1:22:24] down at the River Jordan he said I see
[1:22:27] him day after day and said that same
[1:22:29] anointing he turned around and he said
[1:22:32] behold the lamb of God it takes away the
[1:22:36] sin of the world I've made my statement
[1:22:40] dairy stands see the bride
[1:22:49] you think Satan don't anoint the people
[1:22:52] of this message he said yeah but the
[1:23:00] Bible - you know the Bible the Bible
[1:23:03] plainly tells you two things about a
[1:23:07] prophet one if that prophet comes and
[1:23:13] tells you things you better hear him
[1:23:16] because I sent him - he says if that
[1:23:24] prophet tells you something and it comes
[1:23:26] to pies listen he takes you to another
[1:23:30] God he said don't believe him now read
[1:23:34] the rest of the story was a resident
[1:23:36] said he said because I sent him among
[1:23:41] you to try you that's what people can't
[1:23:48] get that straight they think there's
[1:23:51] there's the anointings and the shoutings
[1:23:53] in the glory hallelujah is the word of
[1:23:56] God Brian brought yet somebody just sit
[1:24:00] down and simply talking to you about God
[1:24:02] see they hate that but I'll ask you to
[1:24:07] do one thing and I'm not against
[1:24:09] emotions you say I am you're a liar and
[1:24:13] you'll answer to God because I'm a more
[1:24:15] emotional than anybody in this building
[1:24:17] you just don't never see it because I
[1:24:21] don't want nothing built on emotions
[1:24:23] I want it built on the Word of God there
[1:24:29] is emotion that goes for the Word of God
[1:24:31] but give me the word first see Eve
[1:24:37] didn't run around and said didn't wait
[1:24:41] if God was going to bring it would not
[1:24:44] have brought it and talked to her and
[1:24:47] told her the truth free moral agency
[1:24:56] puts us a right to choose the soul is
[1:25:01] where the choosing is from because you
[1:25:03] can't choose from your body you always
[1:25:06] do wrong you can't choose in your spirit
[1:25:09] room you'll always go wrong you
[1:25:13] understand what I'm saying Eve then in
[1:25:16] her soul was still pure but her spirit
[1:25:22] got anointed of the devil and she called
[1:25:28] it the Holy Spirit I asked you to go
[1:25:34] home and read anointed ones at the end
[1:25:37] time and see if your prophet did not
[1:25:41] explain that as being that even the Holy
[1:25:47] Spirit would come on you is to try you
[1:25:54] to see if you'll stand on the word
[1:26:01] you said well it's not important to me
[1:26:03] to understand body spirit so I don't
[1:26:05] care what it is you just said it you
[1:26:10] don't care what it is I've made myself
[1:26:15] plain for 30 or 40 years on that subject
[1:26:18] brother branham did not have to come
[1:26:20] back and correct that because he always
[1:26:23] told five senses for the first room five
[1:26:27] senses for the second room one sense for
[1:26:30] the center realm he never had to change
[1:26:34] it because he was always right no I'll
[1:26:39] tell you this and we'll stop on it
[1:26:41] because see there's no difference in the
[1:26:43] word spirit take you Strong's
[1:26:46] Concordance and try to find a word
[1:26:48] spirit in the New Testament and you'll
[1:26:50] find it has only one definition they
[1:26:53] don't matter worse the spirit of the
[1:26:55] devil whether it's the spirit of this or
[1:26:57] spirit of that it's got the same writing
[1:27:01] that's one man has always been deceived
[1:27:05] on the body the spirit and the soul you
[1:27:13] know that before I came into this
[1:27:14] message I heard a doctrine you ever
[1:27:18] heard this one that man never had a soul
[1:27:22] until the law came I listened to a man
[1:27:27] at work explain it after the service he
[1:27:31] goofed up by asking me what I thought
[1:27:33] some way and I said well you saying that
[1:27:37] man didn't have a soul until the law
[1:27:39] that's over Exodus
[1:27:41] you know part of it that I said
[1:27:43] according to my understanding the Bible
[1:27:45] said it he breathed into the nostrils of
[1:27:47] Adam and he become a living soul he
[1:27:54] stopped he said I never thought of that
[1:27:59] but did he change his teaching I doubt
[1:28:02] it
[1:28:05] does he thought he had
[1:28:07] beautiful story he thought he had wisdom
[1:28:13] that there wouldn't no soul of mankind
[1:28:15] that the law brought in knowledge of sin
[1:28:18] that's exactly right
[1:28:22] but there's no salvation in the law
[1:28:25] either law only condemns you what about
[1:28:39] it when they don't matter body spirit
[1:28:43] and so I guess it don't matter about
[1:28:45] father-son oligos Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:48] those are both in the Bible you're just
[1:28:55] too sarcastic I'll agree with you I
[1:28:58] still love the Lord and I try my best
[1:29:00] and I've tried for 50 years almost to
[1:29:04] preach the truth this little group of
[1:29:07] people for us to be able to stand on
[1:29:10] God's Word and say thank you
[1:29:15] somebody come along quotes you something
[1:29:17] just go back and listen listen to the
[1:29:20] Prophet in your mind and he'll just come
[1:29:23] back home brothers is this you'll just
[1:29:26] come right around in your mind and
[1:29:28] you'll hear brother Branham say but
[1:29:34] that's not right you hear him say
[1:29:45] Christ is the word that's revealed
[1:29:53] Christ is the word that's revealed he
[1:29:59] was body spirit and soul Almighty God is
[1:30:03] what's your prophet said about him he
[1:30:05] said in body he was a man he said in
[1:30:08] soul it was God in another time he said
[1:30:10] in body he was a man he said in spirit
[1:30:12] he was God so who was that little one
[1:30:15] laying in the cradle brother Bobby said
[1:30:18] use it the other day we wrote a random
[1:30:20] said it the fullness of the Godhead
[1:30:22] bodily laid right there in that cradle
[1:30:26] if he his father son Holy Ghost then we
[1:30:29] don't have to worry about him being body
