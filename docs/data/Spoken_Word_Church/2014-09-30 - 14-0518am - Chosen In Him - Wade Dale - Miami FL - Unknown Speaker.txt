thoughts masterp family so we're going to read scripture today we're going to stay in the Bible is it all right I just amen we're not when we get to Glory we get to Glory we're not going to have all the brother down again relax let's turn to Ephesians I didn't bring my electr device never runs out of battery the old fashioned way I'm on hear meway you know the we were talking back the great mystery that we've been talking you know shamefully we had our conversation sometimes in times past of the world how that this hand that you see that now holds the Bible used to hold something that wasn't good beer cigarettes and when I was when I was in the world I us I used to say things with this that was not good amen amen but God didn't have to rebuild this outside part still this is the same hand this is the same mouth but the mystery is Satan's gone God so now this hand that used to ra a beer now raises the same mouth that destroy hopefully now is able to help there's thean looks at you the same guy no it's not cuz it's changed on the inside that inside work brings the outside man into subjection am amen so let's read in the book of Ephesians we're still on the Masterpiece family but we're going to speak on chosen in him now we've been talking about it the whole time now let's break that scripture amen everybody okay good bright Sun the resurrection let's have a resurrection not out of the Grave the dead works that we the conversations we used amen so Ephesians 1 start with verse one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are in Ephesus don't tell me that's too far away from my mouth okay can you give me that Gatorade I can't hold the Gatorade okay to the Saints which in Ephesus and Perfection church and to the faithful in christes so he's writing to a special group I read my Bible amen talking the world Grace be to you and peace from God our Father we've been talking about that and from the Lord Jesus blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us didn't do that I go back to already blessed who has blessed us with all all spiritual blessing now where is Heaven that's going to pass away I thought the prophet we're not going to heaven Heaven's coming here Heaven's here this is where we going to we're not going to float on a cloud and play hard I can't play anything sorry ex I love these brothers you know what they'll be playing in eternity you can play instrument you know what you're not going to get tired you're just going to play you want lose that God gave you that he's not going to take amen am he's not going to take according as he had chosen Us in him am before the foundation of the world show you that we look how personal that is that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love let's bow our head dear heavenly father we pray that you'll bless this Lord your words already blessed but we ask you to bless the people bless the speaker Lord you the one that you be the one that Lord just be with us if there be any sick among us here you said you sent the worder them from their destru father a word may you heal may you save may you San we ask these amen so we look at this okay amen Sunday morning everybody's dressed all pretty let's listen for a little while let's see what God can say last night we ended up by that image being able to speak now listen we can't just speak presumptuously because brother brand said if we are presuming that means we're venturing without Authority so the authority we can't just speak when we want to now there's an example of let's turn to the book of act keep your Bibles we're read SC book of Acts because remember if you speak you got to know how to speak and you got to have the authority CU if you don't watch what happen verse 11 and God wrought special Miracles by the hands of Paul Paul's full of the Holy Ghost right's full of the Holy Ghost he has the authority so that from his body were brought an are a and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out now if you'll notice how much y believe that scripture in Acts you see what I got in my I have prayer CL that we preach over cut them up cuz I don't believe that was just for Paul my I've seen cancer just because of man AC that's not just for PA if you have the Holy Ghost so I keep it right here blessing but let's continue now there were people that were watching this that were watching Paul it would watch them take a cloth give it to someone and an evil spirit Le but now here comes the group of without the Holy Ghost then certain of the Vagabond Jews Exorcist witches whatever took upon them to call over them which had evil spirit look they call in the name of the Lord Jesus saying we adure You by Jesus prach that's not I'm not going to adure somebody by the paach god you PR and there were seven sons one a Jew hey this guy was chief of the priest he should have known better which did so and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know know so if we speak the devil's just going to stay there he doesn't care what you but Paul had experience these people had never had experience amen hallelujah and the men in whom the evil spirit left on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house and they left in worse shape than they can that's venturing without Authority am so if we're going to speak with authority we must not have a second hand Revelation am it's all right that William had a revelation but I can't ad evil spirit so we got know how to speak and have Authority or you're going to be in the shape there's a example amen am so now as we go I want now as we come to a place that we're going to look at this scripture we're still going to go back to Romans 8 but almost be able to amen amen but in Romans 8 he did predestinate so see the ones that God for they have authority because God you just got to find out what you're doing here and where you going Adam had complete Authority man he had he had authority over everything we speak president here on the earth n n no what Adam said I sign up again he ruin the whole world what are we going back to what are we going back to and that doesn't make us have a big head I hope you don't leave here but I hope you leave here with because Revelation makes you humble it humbl you things and he trust Youth and that you can speak because when when Michelangelo the very thing that been same way with God God had those he had those attributes he had your inheritance but the picture wasn't developed sure it was real to him he wanted to see you he had Joy he was proud his children he could see made manifest another form that's right so sin didn't bother God he still had picture he just had to hang on to it for a little like last night he develop that picture because this is the you got to have a POS you got to have something to before you can have a negative now for those of you young children don't know what a negative we have this used to we' have a ro some of your old on going you have to take it somewhere and they would develop you don't have to do that now cuz you got little SD card those things you know but it doesn't do away with what God has God had a picture in and he was going to see it manifest which was you and I so those Eternal thoughts were expressed now remember John 1 in the beginning was the word so the word was there amen the word was there sure man just wrote this thousand years ago but this was before the found am it just had to develop through Isaiah all the prophets down to Jesus Christ but in John 1 in the beginning in the beginning was the word the word was with God and word verse 14 that word was made fles we can see same way with you and I in the beginning the genis and it was a word not individuals remember that we weren't individual we weren't running around see that's where the Mormons get that Mormons say we were all up there then we came down here brother said that's not true you were nothing only in the mind just like when I was 16 years old I was a potential father I had the ability to be a father amen and my children were in me but you couldn't find them but they were in my thoughts but through holy wedlock they develop well that was the natural way God works the same way he works through the spoken work amen am but he still listen Adam needed to finish the program Adam not reproduce he needed God cannot without got all right listen we're going to down calm look talk about this talk about but let's stay on our subject so the word became flesh right Jesus Christ the word word he was real he was the one stand okay so he was there we weren't but we were part of it in an attribute form amen everybody okay with that so how we come here remember the word became flesh he was the word before and so he had to come the right way bring us here and then now the flesh is becoming word amen the word became FL but through him I told you last Jesus didn't bring you well that shocked you a little bit he came and he didn't bring it you already had he just brought you the way back to the tree of life because if you get on the tree of life that's life Jesus it's eternal life amen amen you love the Lord so the word became flesh so that the flesh could become word CU we're going to have a word body amen the body Mom and Daddy brought old amen amen all you got to do is look around you look next year you going have more hair unless still get I don't know where that came from John 1 the word became flesh so that now in our flesh the word can be back in power just like in Jesus Christ this evening we're going to get in we've got to realize that Jesus whatever he is whatever characteristic we must to get out of here now remember Abraham Abraham took a temporary body change he died he was changed by amen amen Jesus Christ when he died he came by with the glorify that's never going to die so if we can see that we're not just chosen in him just for the new birth but we're chosen in him for a body change you can't change your body a doctor cannot get we must depend on to change this body but it's not going to come from it's going to come from in here it's a secret catching away of the Bride we're just going to all the saints are going to come but you're not going to go out in the graveyard they're not going to have to dig theirself out to see have to push your way out when Jesus came back walk the you know what he must had he must have been solid somewhere when he ate remember he told me he said hey give me some fish give me some bread he said other words when he ate it hit the floor went somewhere you what he walk back through the wall that's why you and I got to come all people nobody's ever done it before but it's commission for to do that's our mandate from God there is not another that we can say well there's if you don't do it somebody amen I'm just dumb enough to believe this me you got to say the same now on the day of P God was so happy he finally started seeing his children amen amen 12 Jesus isah over in the other dimension he said praise God he's seeing this what I oh that's why those they wanted to see you they spoke they spoke of this and they wanted to see so they could see that Vision a group of people that believe more than people and they did exactly what they WR Isaiah he wanted to see that virgin cons was unheard of could probably went home scratch his wife prob what you say he said I saw it it come from God AET going have anything to do but I'm prophesying to Happ that was Jesus Christ amen amen so God was happy on the day of PC amen amen his SE became alive became in flesh he said wait so long and he struck him and say speaker verse one you know they were scared right they were scared they were all in a room the one that they thought was deliver them was dead and and he had come back but some of them didn't believe it you know after Jesus appeared with them walked through the wall went fish if this brother died three days later I saw him again you think i' Go Fish you think got go fishing I like to fish something I want but the problem with that person wasn't in didn't have a revation the day he was the first one he he preached 4 like me he preached him a 45 minute Serv rejected him crucified and he had come back and Peter spoke you know what God Said Peter said rep and Beed in the name of Jesus and the king in heaven spoke and what a revelation repent baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen so that Genesis one became alive and it hadn't stopped speaking s SP spok all all the spok William and he's not going to stop we're going to be speaking for etern listen people notri aible but if you ever find yourself you find you're already ready already you don't you got to make this one hallu Hallelujah Lord Brother ROM said when you became born again that you heard from your the we read the quot that was a the and there's only one Jesus Christ held that the only and that's the soul of God that's why we we you'll give his soul my father about 10 years ago preached in a church on the soul of God and the preer there had a problem a message PR but when he got to read the word he got to read the quot he saw that God was a s the only Eternal that's where you and I came from only one now look these brothers are from born there I was born in America but I received a new birth about 15 years ago say they receive new birth now is there a new birth different than mine you got the same the same's only one Soul there's only one theop and if you're born again today you got the same Soul if you have birth but if you do we're all one where we really are because listen my wife and I have been married for 35 years my my my6 coming up now we're one and in God we're one now we're phally she has a DNA makeup of her family all right so we can't use that as an examp let's go back the youle sheer her name wasis their name that's true Oneness I said there we physically can't after the fall but by the new birth different but we're supposed to all so that makes us part of the family you can't take a sample of this BL in natural terms but if she could take her eternal life it test you do every service word t and he says oh that's my child but she's got the same she's got the same you see how close obviously see how far away thought all this that God that we were waiting on something if you're born again you are already God and when he sees us all he's going to say theet God was God ad and Eve in the Garden of Eden having Fellowship now to me and you that's if we look through natural and Redemption is not replacable you can't drop this pick up this if you drop Redemption and then God Pi it back that's where we got to go see so really it's wrong for us to I mean for illustration purposes we can point and say we're going back that's coming here brother preach hiding himself simp he preach great Jesus Christ u the seven seal he preached God in simp but our problem we have a mind the only reason I can't go through that I go to reasoning that I'm a I mean it's kind of silly but that's start reasoning out you know God or Jesus when he came back glorified body when he was getting ready to enter that he didn't walk up to that wall maybe I can maybe there wasn't a thought in his that's problem we are it that was Jesus glori body and it was thanes prom put his hand in his touching something th put his know let me something how this God is how this father so great didn't need us Tov do you think God needs you God don't need you but he wants you am am amen but you know what that Eternal Father that Eternal God never had a beginning will never have an end he came here on Earth and Manar his body man's beat his they drove Nails his hands feet they chopped his side openet God said he look like Hamburg a whole face full of and they spit on this but when he came back in a glorified body he still had SCH that God to get you into a perfect body gave his body up for eternity will have those nail but you won't you will live in a perfect body oh if man man to put not going to be there you're going to be perfect what a great dadd we he us be perfect for eternity he took your Scar the on you should he took your stri he took the nail prints the on you he should have nailed me and you et when we see those one thing for sure our father came and rescued us a p gave us a glorified that will never be imperfect the worlds God s son I wouldn't send my son to die I go myself I go myself in the form of a son for amen amen so you heard from youry but you had to hear you understand all out the scripture in the book of Acts leave there had to be a sermon preached so that the people there could respond amen amen you remember the Ethiopian he was he was sitting in his car he was on his Chariot read the Bible is that right he was reading Isaiah my hands and my Fe he could understand so God sent one of he said pH he said I got a son so he just took Philip put him right the car with right and the Bible said he expounded cuz what the Ethiopian unit couldn't understand this man speaking of himself all fell up just took and he he said hey here's water let's get it done real quick I you understand things when the Holy Ghost he went preaching so that seed life has to come through the body am am so it has to connect with the word because if we were chosen in we got to be able to see that so the part of the words you heard and responded to was the part or the attribute of God that he saw before the foundation that you would respond to that's why the word had to be that's why you had to be trust then he brought the word you were sitting one night day listening to a Ser or right amen amen cuz the life has to come down through the body you can't get this by yourself so what that person did when they brought you the word the book was closed you could understand am but when he open open the book you saw what you your name know he said all all that's what I've been looking for I've been looking for a waying for so that's why the book you can see your name everything when he scream you think we scream last night everybody in every diens my that's what you got but you got to see it in the word can't see it from man's IDE got to see your name in the word of God thats your amen so the part of the word you heard it responded this is my quote I come up with this came up with it I just wrote it the part of the word you heard and responded to God having for knowledge you would get here so he had this word for you because you know I'm respond to a different part of the Bible than you see genesis6 everything to me you may have your there6 books sure they're all but I love genesis6 with me and I don't want you to say well that's that's second Revelation that's Paul we know and when you do God has to break the Holy Ghost burn all that old you can't understand the word of God oh you can get an intellectual without why could ethopian un not understand he didn't have a new birth but once Philip he actually brought the author with him I've always said brother Rand said you know you must get the spirit of the conductor and remember prophet of God said this is a love letter let me give you an example my wife and I been married 35 years and sadly she's beginning to think like me she used to have a good mind her family her family say she lost her mind she lost her mind I to do tonight I swear you may need to my get his word out get out of we don't need just take up space part of the words you heard and responded to set aside for you so therefore we can be chosen in him amen the great mind of the conductor or the example that I'm going to give you that in your mind but sister Jun and I have been married 35 years we do think a lot of life we have become one live together now I can write her a love letter say I'm in Miami I'm at the Perfection church and I'm doing this and that other well now I can send her that letter okay okay or I can write a book and she knows exactly what I'm saying she experienc now if I take that book Hees he didn't experience WR see that's why it's the mind of the one that wrote the book is in you understand he can understand what he read that same way with the Bible we didn't understand alen but oh when he Dr that M and that thing clicked inside beening without God we can't I think we're a I believe the mind now two points in Reading scripture sometimes we read scripture and we don't see God's part but the way God SE am am so he can write a word be therefore perfect the B says there's perfect no not sometimes you but you got to remember stay there I got my instructions I've already given instructions if you're sitting here and you're on this side of Eternity and you're listening to what God Said through a minister now you're not already perfected amen but in God you are so that way he can write a positive word but he didn't just write that word so so that way I want you to read That's why that it covers a lot of things let's turn to Romans Romans 8 now this scripture without Revelation cannot be comprehended Romans 81 how many of you been condemned this morning raise your hand your you have been condemned when you got up this morning you don't need to go oh you is not right I can't do this don't raise your hand now what a scripture let's get on this side of there is therefore now no are after now let's read it with some understand there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Genesis who walk not that's what God speaking through Paul is telling you if you're born again that new birth allation and we don't walk after we walk in the we don't walk after am so read your scripture like that you got the Genesis 126 Perfection remember never had a bad day never said a bad word never be it didn't fall it always was that's brother if you're born again always looking at this he said if you know that word if is only 11 if the spirit see asking you a question shall also Quicken don't say Immortal it says speaking of we we're already Qui we're already we need it now quick this guy all right let's break let's look at Ephesians 2 now remember of Ephesians they were a very mature Church they were very powerful it was a huge Church 12 people amen some numbers don't mean anything so Paul is talking he says bless me verse three we're finishing right here blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who is blessed everybody say us if you believe it with all spiritual blessing according as he has chosen Us in him now that word in we're not on this building tonight we're not around this building we we're in this building we have something around so if we're chosen in him all of that look watch this CU I the Apostle Paul he said that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now that's not talking on the earth there is that picture because look at verse five having predestinated unto the adoption of Jesus Christ according to the good pleasure to the praise His where he has made us AC in the belov so this is the development of the picture talking about Genesis because remember down here we're not holy come on this is not this is not blameless yet so in this scripture we see it in another dimension it's still a mystery amen amen amen having pred us the adop of children according to good pleasure of his where he made us that's in glory but you you can't stay there got come down so watch in whom we have Redemption now listen there's no redemption in heaven Mumble Mumble there's no redemp need Redemption the people in the six need Redemption Redemption happen the Earth if you fell on Earth this is where PA verse verse is brought it right down to the Earth amen amen in whom we have Redemption through his blood amen the forgiveness of sin don't need forgiveness of but Paul's bringing it according to the riches of wherein he have to bound it look at all these us and we in all wisdom and Prudence made known to us the mystery of his Willet word this is the reading of the well today we came we had a father did we had a father that died without the death of a testator there somebody died and when somebody died and you're part of the family you go to the reading of the you're in line if you're in line for something father your name in our word amen mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has per purpose in himself a you believe or not like I said I'm just to believe that in the dispensation of the fullness of time get that word time time 2,000 years he's been building his brother 2,000 years in the dispensation of the Genesis 126 because when we're finished of time amen am he might in one what we talking about in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in him also we have remember didn't come to bring us we obtained it before the foundation knowledge of God knowing that we would choose we got here therefore he could choose us for found me that's simple in also we have obtained in being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work all after the Council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom you also trusted after now what we were talking about after you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your put your name in there the gospel of your salvation you must believe that that he brought in whom also after that you believe you got to believe you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of pro now here's where we're going to stop here and pick up this afternoon because when you receive the new it's your Earnest family but it and it gives you Authority but it doesn't give you full because remember when you buy a home buy a car you have to put down earnest money or down payment now that down payment is because it begins youney making your

hours why you he said thank God what a God when I was out in the world for years people were praying for me I didn't care I was doing the things of the world but the father Pap never forgot he knew where he knew exactly that if he cross my path one on Wednesday night I can't been there ever since but it's the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of The Possession the praise of his GL now what is what is the full when you pay your car off your house boy it's a wonderful time cuz you made all you and you get what get a title and you can do with whatever want amen see that heading toward adoption that's when you get full Authority see this is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchase which is Body Spirit and soul Satan still got a little bit hold but in God's it's he's got a glorified body got all to work but adoption is your name on the check not you and your dad thank you Lord now listen when you got the new birth God give you you got the earnest I mean you're making your pay so as long as you make your pay Bank leaves you alone right Christ whatever you need but now in adoption we're going to read here in Romans 8 your name becomes
