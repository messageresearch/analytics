[Music] want to see me man I want to see [Music] shining in the light of your own perhaps your power Oh [Music] hi [Music] shining in the light of the gallery pour out your power [Music] I want to see I wanna see him don't you and it's good to be in the house of the Lord you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading from Ephesians 2 and then we'll go to 1st Peter 1 Ephesians 2 first Peter 1 now remember the Lord willing this coming Saturday will be the fellowship meeting that brother can change my wife and I are not planning on going it's just the problems are and it taxed into her I want to make sure and get these services true on Sunday you know and take both of them together to kind of get a point to you what I'm driving out so my wife and I won't be going you you be glad for you to go you know and hope you do you know only to disagree to science for us but we won't we won't be going okay number waiting June will be leaving Friday to Arizona to be with brother long out there and have been ministering for that so keep those in mind any other announcements there any father we thank you for this day in your grace thank you that Lord no matter what it is and the day that we're living the time no matter no matter how bad it gets we can still look to you we can see you and let you manifest yourself among us in a mighty way we love you and we thank you and we ask you to just come now and minister your word unto each one of us father leaders that we may speak once you have for us to be saying remember the sick among us you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so heal those that are in Lord we know that we're human and we're gonna have problems where we're going to be sick and things like that but we have some that are seriously into situations that need you Lord so we just ask you to reach down into each one and just have your way forgive our sins lead us by thy grace and love in Jesus name Amen Asians to verse 8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God okay let's go over to 1st Peter 1 and we'll begin reading the thirteenth verse through I guess the twenty-fifth says we're for gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ now there supposed to be a grace brought to us at a revelation so Grace and revelations got to go together that's if you don't get anything of the night you get that part grace and revelation has to be interlocked with each other you know because that's that's where it is all right as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance but as he which have called you is holy be so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be there being you holy for I am holy and if you call on the father who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work pass the time of your sojourning here in fear for as much as you know that we were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's it won't do it that won't redeem you right is that what it's saying for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things it won't work they don't matter what we think of this that or the other it won't work all right from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and that spot Hoover Lee was foreordained before the foundation of the world what was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in God seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of him as the flower of the grace the rice with grace withereth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the Lord endureth forever now watch him and this is the word of the Lord which by the gospel is preached unto you and you may be seated the Lord at his best seen to the reading of the word no it really enjoyed this past weekend with brother Forney I think he's done a marvelous job and everything we appreciate everything no but just break the Lord would lead us on in your love all right now we've been talking about the new birth our salvation and knowing that the new birth consists of justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Spirit they asked brother Branham and the questions and answers is it required for you to have these three stages he said absolutely all right no matter if you think you received it at one time or if it took you 20 years to get it no matter what you're gonna have to go through that's my point to say to you all of us if we received it at one time praise God if if it took us 20 years praise God he took us three and a half years like the disciple praise God all right let's see we got to do it and ever what it is it has to go through those three stages and all I've been trying to do is to show you what those stages are and try to compare them to our natural you know our lives in our journey because that's why I believe the disciples that they were three and a half years with the Lord Jesus before they receive the new birth that was not necess mean was was necessary for them but it was laid there for you and me if we want to know something about the the way that it takes place go back and read Matthew Mark Luke and John and see what the disciples went through all right then we can go to other things and say well then 3,000 the same day receive West great wonderful I believe in that I believe you can go through it but we have to quote the Prophet you say well you're quoting him for your own benefit okay okay I'm doing it for my own benefit the Prophet said very few people would ever believe all the way okay now that's his wording now if that de-christianized is any of us in our thoughts then we know one thing for sure I mean it's the fact that we don't have it if it makes us upset about what we we do or what we don't do or whatever you know all right now we covered that it would take the three stages because even the last three three ages brother Brennan says the third seal paragraph 169 life the life stage three ages completed the new birth see the ages had to be in correct order for it to come out for us to be in correct order so then it was a completion of it by coming through for justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost gave those on Azusa Street the new birth amen then the Prophet had to come to bring us the word they had to word for their age in time okay they were already preaching a lot of great things your oneness doctrines and different things were already there before the Prophet came into you know on the same all right but the thing of it is they asked him and we covered that you know about it that there was Lucien's left and one of those loose ends if you're reading what I gave you that was the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said his loose ends all right the Prophet had to come to tie together the loose ends to word that we could be ready for the rapture as he said all right now he then according to Malachi 4 got around said birth pangs prior have 170 172 that the bride is to be delivered of a new birth from according to Malachi 4 so there's your new birth of the there's your loose ends to be taken up by Malachi 4 and placed in an order to bring us the complete birth or to finish our birth pricing it in the order and that's why the Prophet had to come and there would have been no way for it ever took place if the Prophet hadn't come on the scene when he came on the scene he started right worth Azusa Street would he started with them and came up because that's what I love about the message it has the greatest of all answers could be thought of I'll get to one in a second where the Prophet says something all right the last three ages then completed to birth and left it to her that this age could come to full maturity are to adoption as we'll get to it later the statue of a perfect man the things that would have to be in this age that would not be there in Luther's age or Wesley's age or Azusa streets you know Pentecost but it would be in this day because they without us cannot be made perfect so they're waiting on us to come to a place of fulfilling our completing that birth all right so then you know that's the point to where we we need to stand whether we're talking what to go outside a little bit about it the that those without us cannot be made perfect do we believe that all right no they asked if you believe this about to live with our workers the Levites our workers got the same pay is the first hour right you know why goes day without us cannot be made perfect so they're waiting on me and you to reach that place to bring them out of the ground and that's why you don't see in there that they're all mad because they didn't get the same pay there's no emphasis related to that story that you'll read to think that they were mad because I had to work all the time and they just went in on free ride dog they didn't go free ride the last part of that age the life part of that day is hard because everything's got to be gathered got to be brought in and lined up and everything got to be cleaned up okay we get onto that so you think about it all right we talked about the prophets saying the seal book paragraph 54 on the third seal that there is a mysterious part of justification sanctification the baptism in the Holy Ghost as I said he covered fuel take it and go back to it to her that this messenger is to top all the loose in one of those loose is was the baptism of the Holy College because people had cabbage down on it and everything else that happened that was one of the mysteries mysteries of what the Baptist says it says the Methodist says is that the presbyterian says it's that we say it's this the brand of might say that what is it that a mysterious part of the new birth just a simple part of being born again all right there's mysteries there in other words a mystery something that is hidden that has to be made known all right see then you'll see one day why it says they then without us cannot be made perfect because they never reached the perfection that was needed to be down through the ages those waiting on you and I okay now that's how important the new birth is we covered the mysterious part I hope you listen to what I was saying that under justification it's in three stages your sins are chopped off by repentance from believing then you go on in your being chopped off chopped off you go on to the basis that you've done it with cry invisible Union you find that it's as though you never done it see chopping off your eyes seeing these chops that all doesn't it into the future but justification under the mysterious part of unveiling it brings it to the basis that we can see that you we done it we done it and God has an exact right to condemn every one of us and kill us but instead of doing that he covers it because he forgives our sins and this is though you never done it then he comes to the bases are saying the real you which is the baptism with the holy ghost never did do that to me it's a great mystery that's a great opportunity for weeks and weeks or months the years for preaching and you know how I'm on one topic I get on something like this I can stay on it for years they don't bother me I know it bothers you but maybe you don't understand what I'm talking about cause if he did you'd be rejoicing saying come on come on come on come on come on preach some more about it that's I get something that says I'm bored and I get others that say don't stop don't quit brother to help keep repeating yourself over and over until we get it okay so where do I go I go down the line all right we covered sanctification in three stages how that you're sanctified by the fact of your repentance and casting out of the unclean spirit and all like that and how your sins are gone all right then we covered that there's a daily sanctification in your growth development a daily sanctification Paul said I die daily see he knew that he had to keep himself under subjection the Prophet said I have to do that you just think of all that he faced you think he didn't have to die daily huh what's he went through daily sanctification then we went through sanctification even under the seals that would bring it to the basis that even the world will be sanctified cleansed and set aside to be able to be used even in starting to be used in the Millennium it has to go into that part all right then we covered the baptism of the Holy Ghost in three stages the new birth were you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and he comes and lives in you giving you eternal life all right then it comes to and we'll get to it later on on the adoption the adoption to work that you and I have to be adopted into the family all right then it comes to the complete final baptism of the Holy Ghost for a man in the world to cleanse us and make us to be totally pure all right what happens in then God does this because he wants to fill every fiber of the church that was a lie start on what I was on the other Wednesday I guess I feel ever fiber they'll ever fiber that's what he wants to do cuz in doing that we're brother Dale I thought I got everything that's what the Baptist said and brother Owen said they're wrong see you say I got everything when I believe that's not according to Scripture that's contrary to the Bible and the Prophet you say well that that that's not me well that's between you and God that ain't nothing to me I'm not your Savior but I am one thing if you claim me to be your pastor you're gonna hear from me because I'm gonna take the responsibility of being the pastor I'm gonna take responsibility saying it the way I believe it if you don't want it that way then hey help yourself go somewheres I'll do what you want - I want no problems against anybody he never tried to run nobody off but it's kind of like one brother done we preached women in 30 years and he left and he said setting off his women and he said brother Dale I'm leaving us and okay that's your choice he said and I'll never say nothing against you to anybody in any way it's no quebra that's good you know about three or four months later he was telling people that called him and talking to him if you'll come and ask me why I left I'll tell you well I thought he wouldn't don't say nothing against me okay forget it you see that's where I just let the whole thing ride cuz it ain't gonna change me on that all right but now let's get to something because I want you to think about this new birth now I'm gonna approach it funny go up to a spot and try to get you to believe it I'm thinking about all right now to a lot of people the new birth that they get any work when they believe no I'm giving you overall view of the of the system religion part and you know and in this message Park okay a lot of people think you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost when you believe okay are you living now then others believe you don't get to baptism of the Holy Spirit until the headstone comes now that's basically people of the message because the denomination don't know anything about that alright what do you see what I'm talking about look at the vast difference of what people can say they believe people say they get the baptism of the Holy Ghost when they believe I believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and he accepted me and give me the baptism the Holy Ghost will praise God the brother Brennan said there was a lot believed and didn't you he said you say you shouted he said there was a lot shouted and didn't get it he said you say you got the baptism he said you can have it every day in your life on your spirit and I go to hell it's time to think over the things the Prophet is saying and that's what I'm trying to do because the Prophet is covering things to give us an opportunity because that's what I've always believed and taught you this way that down through the ages the disciples that's why I believe it where do I believe the Apostle Paul taught adoption etc different things Peter doesn't mention basically the word adoption he may say it or something but he doesn't go deal in that Paul deals with adoption but now Peter he deals with a statute of perfect man in other words Paul I've always taught you this Paul tells us how to go up the statute are from the new birth up to the statute of perfect land to the chains of the body Paul tells us that the Peter tells us how Peter gives the directions of how its to be done so they both brought it together in a wonderful situation I love it when run around and said it this way he said Paul and Peter with no difference in doctrine I love that because you read sometimes repeater and he sound like he's kids Paul read Paul's telling he's against Peter mister prophet said no they wasn't he said this teaching the same identical time all right now so where do we fit where do we fit do we get borned again somewhere here below the pyramid as far as what's called faith is that the point of just believing on the Lord Jesus Christ do we get the new birth iyer or do we get the new birth when it comes up to the pyramid at the top well there's teachings in this message that away teaching you this message say you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost like they did on the day of Pentecost well brother Brown said something see I get if I get people upset at me because I say that but hey remember one thing I'm the pastor I'm gonna say it the way I believe it if you don't want it come to my office we'll sit down talk about it but make sure you bring your equipment we don't come in there to me and say brother Dale I don't agree with you but I don't know words I had and what it is I just don't agree with you don't waste my time or your time just leave it alone tell me where I'm off cause I'm gonna tell you why I don't agree with what get up here and say this is what I believe you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna prove it about what I believe so I do not believe that you're born again just by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ to give you the full eternal life leave it on the Lord Jesus Christ just doesn't give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost but neither do I believe you got to wait up to the top and get the headstone and all of that - how's the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe there's a truth in between dark I believe the truth is in between though cuz listen I've got it written down y'all get back to it later and I'll get this point would you ever know this brother branham sayin he said I firmly believe let's see uh you must be born again he said I firmly believe that you are born again and then baptized the end of the body you gonna say well I'm born again I'm baptized in the button no no no what are you gonna say I'm gonna say he's writing both sides because for me to try to correct him that won't work so for me to try to understand so then you just take a statement he makes you are born again by the new birth it places you into the body of Christ and then you are positionally placed in the body for the gifts adoption and the things so he's right and see when you say well well justification brother deal I got where to probably said justification said I save amen I believe that always told it that way well I sure don't sound like what you will you ain't listening could you see when your sins is truly forgiven you now I'm quoting brother branham's he won't pigs I'll say if you find them if you're truly repentant of your sins and died in that position you're going to heaven what he said but now that you'll tell you in another place that don't put you in the body of Christ so you're going to the white throne they don't give you eternal life to just repent of your sins but if you die in that state now remember that too later don't misquote me if you die in the state of the point that you have been repent of your sins and you've come even to sanctification sanctification not being the new birth it's only a way to come to the new earth with sanctification even if you're justified and sanctified if you die in that state yes you're going to heaven yes but you are not going to be in the bride because you've not received eternal life you don't get eternal life at justification you're confessing something you don't get eternal life at sanctification you're confessing something you get eternal life at the baptism of the Holy Ghost did you birth well and only those who have the new birth the Prophet said is the ones who qualify for the rapture all right so now then don't misunderstand what I'm saying I believe if you come to the altar and repent of your sins and you die in that state now I said die in that state and it's genuine now don't make me that did somebody come up only be safe okay you're safe no but no no a genuine experience of justification is all this chops off your pie sins a half way south-south step little well out Lord I'm sorry would you forgive me that ain't gonna give you eternal life that's why the Prophet made that statement of the love he said you have accepted Jesus Christ he said but has he accepted you see he said if he accepts you he'll give you the baptism when the only God why are you in me now so what's the end of the scale are we some believe you get mourned again down here somewhere below the pyramid and then others believe you don't get born again until you come up to the headstone which one are we gonna go with all right let's go with something that is so wonderful and marvelous how that prophet could talk about things in such of a way that a child could understand him of what he's saying but yet baffle the theological error what he would call it rim of mankind so simple did he'd make it so simple till the people couldn't father what he's saying well I got him over here where he says here and I got him over here where he says - won't this hold on a little while they'll come together then you'll find out he's saying the same thing and if he ain't saying the same thing you and I'd have no right to try to correct him to say he was right or wrong or whatever it is cuz we're not the Prophet well I don't care who it it you're gonna quote said so and so if you're gonna quote me remember you better quote me right sure I believe if you repent of your sins and die in that state you're going to get eternal life but you're not born again you're gonna go to the white throne judgment and receive eternal life as a foolish virgin okay show me anywhere else it can be so now let's just take something that the Prophet said go ahead brothers over to number six so you'll see these others with quoting recoating I want you to read this little statement number six on the Messiah sixty one one one seven like it reminded me to give these dates I noticed I've got work and I say something don't give the dates that it's on oh you know I'll give the title its owner for them and they order to know it but still so many Atari nice huh alright now for instance when a man gets saved my brother there what happened to me when I got saved the prophets gonna tell you I love his way of telling us because you know what he tells us in a way that it can be attained into he doesn't make it to where it can't be attained unto I mean I hate it for somebody to come up say we're gonna go run a race what is it you're gonna guy four-minute mile he's already broke that and he's probably something broke that behind him well I ain't gonna get in the race cuz I can't run that far I first off I couldn't make it tomorrow the second off I certainly couldn't follow him into speedy runs let's just slow down and listen to what the Prophet says let him explain what happened to you and to me at the new birth let him explain it he's enough for instance when a man gets saved he's just about like the light that comes in to him is about like this little white button on my shirt I thought you so far I thought you come into that all this that you better listen to him the light that comes into them is about like this little white button on my shirt that's when God comes into the inner part of a man now of course we'll stop here to express something you say for instance when a man gets a last year's when he gots repented of his sins he didn't say that so don't you think that well that was when you just get repented he didn't say that let's let him talk a lot that comes into him is about like this little white button on my shirt that's when God comes into the inner part of a man I like that don't you not in his body not his spirit with the inner part in the inner part of a man a man is made up made up in this system of a tabernacle the outer courts in the holy place and the holiest of holies this is kind of glory on the inside the veil now on the outside gates of a man is five senses that enters into his body on the inside which is his soul and I watch him are the the soul is the nature of the spirit that's on the inside of his heart okay produces his soul you realize what's in to you coming outwardly comes from your soul and it produces it outwardly what we do come on the soul is the nature of the Spirit that's on the inside of his heart produces his soul which makes the atmosphere around him y'all he has also five entrances then on the inside he has only one gate one interest to go into this kind of glory where God can enter into him and take over in the control tower that way it's through self will whether you will or - will - or not that's up to you but that's the only Avenue that's open to the man that God can come into his heart it's by self wheel puts him right back like Adam and Eve would you like to be back like Adam and Eve not after the fall now would you like to be back like Adam and Eve but running one spoken word reading her seat he said that brings us back like Adam and Eve like it was in the original well I okay puts them right back like Adam and Eve on the free moral agency you can choose right or wrong either one you want to now self will then God comes down into the man into the heart which is the spirit then the spirit makes the soul and the soul dwells in the body now when a man is converted say just like that little white button starts in his heart now we're gonna read something here that's going I want to see if you believe button starts in his heart now that part is God so where's the little white button in your heart you're so and that part is God right okay everybody with me when he's born again with the Spirit of God God's Spirit dwells in him now as he can let that spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press God's way through him again he can become back in the same condition that he was when he was in the Garden of Eden now we've got a little problem we've got a little bit of a problem no let back damned well make sure and see it the little white button starts in his heart now that part is God when he's born again with the Spirit of God God's Spirit dwells in him and now as he can let that spirit grow were in you were in your soul that's what he just said let that spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness but brother though I always thought that everything went out so much till there was nothing left in the soul with me and God and don't put it to be God having any bitterness so well make sure you understand the story if there's anything in our soul besides God it's me and you that's what I've tried to get you to think about if the new birth is a mystery then here's the mystery here as part of the new birth there's still problems that after you're born again you can have some bitterness don't worry about it hold the point now this flag that button in the other mine and hold on a minute and press God's way through him again he can become into the same condition he was in the Garden of Eden so evident he must not be in the same condition oh okay the brother Dale I thought the the unclean spirit root of evil went out at sanctification right I thought the baptism of the Holy Ghost burn out everything that was liking it is no you don't believe your prophet when he says you're born again it's like a little button and the more you let that grow in there the more it's gonna push you out the root of bitterness not the root of evil not the unclean spirit because God won't drought in an unclean vessel so I want to get that in there before you ever start that computer of my brain of yours thinking and say well he don't I taught it and believe it the Prophet taught it the unclean spirit goes out at sanctification but they steal parts of us left and the Holy Ghost comes in to burn out the rest of us right and put a little button a little white button well far let that spirit grow now is that let that spirit grow what is this message here call the stature of a perfect man which is means the growth right now right now come on listen if Anita will put it right turn stop so now if you're following what I'm saying it's easy to think to follow the upper part of that to think about well god this puts this little bitty thing like a button you know that all of you was kind of yeah yeah I can read faces maybe not smart enough to read it all but you kind of was going along with that but then when I said the Prophet said let that spirit grow well if it's a little button you know the size of a little button there's you growth development there's your stature of a perfect man growing in grace and knowledge as we'll get to in a minute do you believe in that you believe in growing in grace and knowledge you believe in being born again okay go ahead and number seven the uncertain sound priest 1960 1218 and yet the man some were down in him some were in him if he could only let that little as I Ellis trated it like a button when a man saved that much of him is God what the little button I really am confused man because I thought when I got the new bird I got it all no no no the Bible says you've got the earnest of your inheritance right we're still in the Bible okay I go straight like a button when a man save that much of him is God that's the little light that comes in in in it comes in to make you quit doing what's wrong oh you mean you need it after you're born again you need something to keep you from doing wrong I'll ask you to go to and get them and listen there's I think it's five or six messages that brother Branham preached that's called doors in doors now he's talking about it and he says there are the new birth he's the born-again Christian doors and doors but he says you've got the doors closed oh you're a Christian you got the doors closed that's what's your profits then he said now you look right in there on the right hand side you know how run around a lot Olivia illustrate he said riding the inside there that heart and soul you know he said you got a little place I call pride well that every bit of that pride merits they went out of me when I got born again that's not what your prophet said well you have made the new birth to be an odd situation to think about but is it the truth whether you like me or not I don't care whether or not this word is right and I try to preach it the way he says it that's where we'll stand then you're gonna have to argue what he says when I just don't believe it well now where did that give you the right to say that what kind of a spirit would it be for you reading brother branham's message to show what happens and you say what does it matter to me I don't care that means that spirit is of the devil oh now you are getting hard on us not hard enough because I ain't cracked about most of you yet you're still sitting looking when it cracks on you you find out and you'll see why it took so long 50 years to preach this message come on as I've Illustrated like a button when a man get man saved that much of him is God that's the little light that comes in to make you quit doing what's wrong now if you can take all the malice I'll tell you what it just bothers me I got righteous indignation but not now is your hatred long church you think all the malice and envy and strife like I said you're not listening you're trying to refute because you're still back there about 15 minutes ago where you said brother Dale you told us that brother Branham says that unclean spirit goes out and the Holy Ghost comes to burn out what's left that's exactly right because right now the Word of God is either cankering in you or me or it's burning out malice Envy strife and time is supposed to be burning out of us now come on but I didn't think I had any that's God you can't tell me not born in this message hallelujah just don't die in it and I don't mean that backwards now I mean it right make it quit doing what's wrong you can take it all the matters that end instruct you mean there's malice envy and strife in a born-again Christian that's what he's saying I mean come on why say something to you go rest Lord gene got no wrong there's a little malice envy and strife there's little things it seems out of there that ain't been took out and like I said if you'll do what I ask you'll see what I'm talking about go get all those messages on doors and doors and see what your prophet said he said you got pride left now here's one that's hard in there I just read it today he said you go inside and look over on the left side maybe something and he said DARS faith he said just don't you make mix with my faith that's what's your prophet said did we say God don't you mix with my faith in other words I believe what I believe I don't care what did it I believe it that's the way I believe it and I'm gonna stay with it my mom said it I'm not against her she said I was born the Baptist and I'll die one well how many people like statements like that but this is what I like the malleus the end of the strife and unbelief out of that little that little button lack of the light and power of God will keep growing growing growing growing can I go back here and say growing growing growing growing growing growing going going glory it's growing growing in grace and knowledge growing crowding out unbelief I think I know one believe okay and you don't do it by expectations ever had that word is enough bodily exercise you do it by sanctified consecrated life that the Holy Spirit moves through you I caught some of you in it this place not long ago no that's just like sanctification the Apostle Paul truly was a born-again Christian right but yet he taught a daily sanctification what far oh that was just out what he done in his spirit oh that just doing it in his spirit prevailed it's just in our spirit where we go wrong I agree with you what the Prophet said it's on the end word man that needs to do the growing you don't grow in your spirit you understand me you don't grow to take away is that it it's got to come out from the inward man and go out orally okay okay Oh Leslie wrote it on the up I think no okay hold on we're on number eight that'll be all right little note the message y61 128 fully don't remember when a man is saved this much like this button here now we already read I three or four he talks about the little button so I mean Lord I know he knows about the little button and look what he says when a man is saved this much like this button here becomes eternal life in your heart that's God and as you're able to push out all the roots of bitterness God then God begins to spread in you then you become a son of God okay he's talking about the image and the hands and the feet and the river what happens what happened because he just believed God God's Word he sent him right back out to shift for himself talking about one of the always wonder about the kingdoms and find Genesis now look now God's trying to bring him back and when you have faith and accept him my brother just let that little lot begin to grow out taking all the roots of doubt and bitterness yielding yourself to the spirit then you begin to become a son of God a daughter of God begin to grow in the grace of God the Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom within you stature of a perfect man okay number nine go ahead to the neck 1962 624 super time let me tell you anything outside of being born again we'll never reach the rapture so now if we don't have the new borough we're not going in the rapture now whose fault is it if we don't have the new bird we're not going in the rapture I mean is that what he said well you're just quoting it listen unless there is a germ of life inside of you you'll perish you cannot rise up again if you haven't got the germ of life in you this afternoon and you're not a Christian why not you walk right up here nice by here what's he talking about go ahead so what do we actually get when you're born again a little white light the loop spot we call it and it needs to grow now let's read what the scripture says about this new birth now all of these is about the new birth not about just justification or something coming unto this is the new birth 2nd Corinthians 1:22 who also has sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit into our hearts so what do you get when you're born again an earnest what is an earnest a down payment or part payment right do you get the fullness no no you just got the part payment you start okay second Corinthians five and five now he that hath wrought us for the self same thing is God who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit okay keep on going these is 1:13 in whom we also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise now that's your enough to enough to know it's talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost the seal of God right and what did he say which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory is that Scripture okay we're we in it first Corinthians three and one and two and I brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babies in Christ I have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now are you able are we able to bear it can we follow that do we get our feelings hurt no some don't go our way come on go ahead to the minute Hebrews 5 11 or 14 of whom we have many things to say he's telling me Oh charity and hard to be uttered seeing you're dull of hearing Christians dull of hearing for when the time you ought to be teachers you need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and our our become such as how need of milk and not of strong meat wherever one that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a baby with strong meat belongeth to them that are a full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil what about it over the next what do we got first Peter 1:22 and 23 we will pick this up next to it I mean this weekend seeing ye are purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit under unfeigned the love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible how by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever how can we ever do it see there was no one ever table I'm gonna say this and you've what are you like it or not alright no one would have been capable of attaining to the statue of a perfect man had brother Adam not come I've said that from day one I still say it and brother branham not come no one could have reached the statue of a perfect man and listen plain language he could not have done it himself unless he was a prophet that the Word of God could come to to teach him how to climb that pyramid I'll do that myself but I'm talking about the man that brought us this message we have the message we just need to believe it what we're doing do we get it all one more quote we'll finish it go to number 19 let back up to that and back up I got back I'm back I'm back we missed one back up there's one scripture now if we're laying aside all malice oh why did now no matters the Prophet says you have malice we need to let it grow get rid of the malice right wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile opened the doors of our heart doors endures an envious and the evil speakings what as newborn babies desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby newborn babies we start as babies we started in the body of Christ as babies I tried to tell you over the years why only death pentecost 120 in the Upper Room and the Holy Ghost come on to them and brother Branham said they had these virtues but they didn't have the headstone now we'll get back to that so the disciples had these virtues but the 3,000 outside received the new birth only his faith because they could not talk the Word of God they only heard one message listen he what there's life's one okay we'll go to that go to 19 no less in chapter 5 part 261 618 I got some scriptures and comments and so forth wrote down here now in Ephesians 1:13 14 if you want to write it down that we have now the earnest the Holy Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance the new birth is an earnest in other words listen the Holy Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance it is the assurance the earnest is the assurance the downpayment that we have been received on into Christ it is the Blessed hope and instance insurance ever I guess that's interesting okay look at the inside way that we do have eternal life and our heirs of everything that he purchased for us oh my and you see it what is the next one start on Sunday Romans 8 Romans 8 what is it heirs and joint heirs with Jesus Christ see I'm not against people in there talking to me about their experiences what I'm against is when those things riled up that don't work out too good now I'm gonna read this got I wrote it down so I read my own notes I would have given you a copy but you couldn't read it I would have to tell you what it say it sister Johnny one times he said let me take all of your messages and type them in the computer so I've got every message that I've ever preached every grace was looking at me like what puppy I got a tote like this in every sermon that I've ever preached I got two notes so you want to know what a priest in a 50 60 s 7 is that I'm loyal in the 70 I've got him but I told her I said what would be any good I just have to move into your home and tell you what I say it and let you top it off okay now listen now here's where we started some believe that you're born again when you believe all right justification or even sanctification some people believe that whereas others believe you are not born again until you receive the capstone or headstone and the pyramid of love that's the vast difference between what a lot of people believe one believes here one believed here somewhere in between I can't see neither of these is to be right okay but there is a way but I do believe that you can be justified by believing on Jesus Christ and to even to also be sanctified and if that is genuine justification and sanctification are truly so that if you die in that state you will go to heaven and receive eternal life at the great white throne which means you are not in the body are broad you're not in the kingdom at justification and sanctification you are believing unto but do not possess the new birth but I believe when you are truly born again you are in the kingdom of God with eternal life but you are waiting the adoption you are a son of God by the new birth when you're born it's like a natural collagen you know by new birth you're born in the body of Christ your son of God okay but not positioned in the body like you will be at the completion of the adoption brother Brandon what outside of this day I'm quoting in perforates but he says what outside of this day is he said about the manifestation of sons and daughters of God outside of this age cuz everything is waiting on this age okay I believe you are born again at the place on the pyramid call faith then you must grow up into him which is the headship see then you are born again by the new birth see if you're born again a new body faith and you can be can be baptized into the body for gifts because that's what your prophet said because I believe you you're born again but he said in you're baptized into the body for gifts that's true that's adoption they see then it that that like you have truly been accepted of God it'll come a day that we're truly accepted of God I believe that looking forward to that day when he can say well done good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord aren't you looking for that come on musicians let's do you got done quicker than I thought okay now you go outside for an hour and a half and talk about where I so wrong and what I said was wrong just just remember one thing what we say his own record its own record and we'll give account of the record brother Brennan said one person in a church into that church he said you will answer for it well you say where are you trying to scare me no no don't worry about it it's not made to be a scare tactic it's made to be a soul saving I'm trying to save your soul not scare you let's just be careful what you say let me say it this way and let it go is it not true that the order of events is supposed to be that if you have a problem you are supposed to go to that person to work out that problem if you can't but now it's not right for a woman to go to a man and straighten him out whether he be preacher or not you're in danger of God because you're not supposed to do it you're supposed to go to your husband this is prophets words let your husband go to the pastor or whatever and then I can say something about it you can bypass a lot of it and don't say nothing but be careful just don't get yourself in trouble with God because you don't agree with what's they come to me bring your husband then come to me our husbands you don't have to bring your wife you come yourself let's talk it over because I believe I've told you the truth and see then that's the danger part is when we think we can straighten out these things you know yourself what I'm saying is right the woman isn't a never-to-be just straighten out the man well hi you mean I can't straight my girl go to the pastor and let him deal with now for a woman to say something to a minister about what they preached you're in danger with God that's as well as I can say it in love and respect to everyone we bring down nation up and on her own sale I love that in the communion where it tells you about those times and says not discerning the Lord's body the Lord's body is his people in his word you've heard me mention some of these brothers that have left but I had ever write to as pastor to tear them to pieces with the Word of God but I've never done it what they've done is their business that's their choice yeah see but I am responsible to the tale the truth and if you don't like it either way like I said then I'm not your passenger but you see you want to come that's the way my family is that's pretty good my family don't agree with us on the word but let one of them get sick right let something happen they get sick they come across railroad track yeah don't you pray farm well that's good I don't know I have any problems cuz its way it ought to be we ought to live close enough to God to where the neighbors can see God and want to come to us if we have if we have a need of somewhere to go to our neighbor I mean go to our other brothers and sisters but just remember we are responsible for our actions and deeds as we're here in this world what do we got your vibes anybody have a need I'm rejoicing [Music] for the hand of God in all my life I've seen [Music] [Music] today anybody else Jesus tied up on the tree I fell down [Music] rejoicing nodded the comfort [Music] every can I'm as happy as a bird that just says free Jesus satisfies my soul Saints account future joy

with me I don't know that's wonderful I won't even hit me [Music] I hope you listener think about this message tonight ghosts are a statue of a perfect man we got to go right back get that little baby that little earnest that little point that little button and start from right there and a Christian journey to bring us to the statue of a perfect man you remember what the probably said Pentecostal thought they got it all but said they didn't he said this got to a place to start live occult he had to come and bring the message I hope you listening to the Hat say there's no hoax outside of the Prophet being who he said he was and what god McClure because there's been no hope for any organized religion redesign you said well I'm not gonna hide religion let's gone well what are we what army if we do like organized religion we have an organized religion spirit father we just thank you for the day and we ask you to do with us or to help us all they were the people to listen to what's saying not to try to figure it out but listen and believe it and thank you let you figure it out because you've told us what it was right through the mouth of the Prophet well wonderful an opportunity to see those things written right out into the word and all we have to do is follow the help us to be Lord as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word to be led of you we love in we thank you in Jesus [Music] that makes me white as snow [Music] the fount I know nothing but the blood of G
