[2:50] chapter
[2:53] 19 and we'll just read a real familiar
[2:56] scripture to us
[2:57] all a little story that
[3:00] brother brandham taught us and has been
[3:02] preached so many
[3:11] times and really you know the reason
[3:14] this come to mind is the other night I I
[3:17] um I got to speak into my
[3:20] family and uh and and and this just kind
[3:24] of came out cuz you know I in this in
[3:27] this day in this hour we're living in
[3:30] we're we're really living in a crisis
[3:31] time because we're coming down to the to
[3:34] the the last few that are coming in and
[3:38] and things are critical things are
[3:41] crucial and who's going to believe the
[3:44] word right and I I want my family to
[3:48] believe so you know I many of us would
[3:52] look at our our our kids and think well
[3:54] well you know they're because they're my
[3:56] kids they're better than everybody
[3:57] else's or whatnot but you know that like
[3:59] brother day always says there without
[4:02] they got little horns holding their
[4:04] their Halo up and you know without
[4:06] without the new birth then there's
[4:09] nothing to to differentiate them from
[4:11] from anybody else we we've all got to be
[4:14] born again you must be born again right
[4:18] and that's what I maybe just take a
[4:19] little simple uh topic tonight and and
[4:22] just speak upon um a comfort in a time
[4:25] of Crisis because what is our comfort in
[4:28] a time of crisis
[4:30] so let's read uh before we go before we
[4:34] go to the word let's go to the
[4:36] author Lord God we just thank you God
[4:39] for giving us the opportunity to come
[4:40] around your word Lord Jesus thank you
[4:43] God for the word that you've given to us
[4:47] and God I pray Lord that you'll let us
[4:48] all have the right attitude and and open
[4:51] our ears and our hearts to receive what
[4:53] said tonight Lord Jesus God I pray that
[4:56] you'll let me have the right Spirit Lord
[4:57] Jesus let everyone have the the right
[4:59] Spirit to receive it in the tone and the
[5:02] attitude that it's meant Lord and I pray
[5:04] God that you'll Lord let the word as it
[5:06] goes forth be a comfort to us Lord Jesus
[5:09] because we need you Lord in this hour
[5:12] it's a critical Time Lord God and I pray
[5:15] God that you'll bless this service Lord
[5:17] and I just give it into your hands we
[5:19] ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[5:22] Christ so let's look at First Kings
[5:26] chapter 19 verse
[5:28] 9 and he came thither unto a cave and
[5:32] lodged
[5:33] there when we know this is talking about
[5:36] Elijah and behold the word of the Lord
[5:39] came to him and he said unto him what
[5:41] doest thou here
[5:43] Elijah now you could ask the same
[5:46] question of all of us what are you doing
[5:47] here right we're all sitting in a church
[5:49] on Wednesday night is it is our what's
[5:51] our goal what's our motive and he said I
[5:54] have been very jealous for the Lord God
[5:57] of hosts for the children children of
[5:59] Israel have forsaken thy Covenant right
[6:02] thrown down thine altars and slain thy
[6:06] prophets with the sword and I even I
[6:09] only am left and they seek my life to
[6:13] take it away now see they they did all
[6:16] this after after God had just pulled out
[6:18] all the stops and he he he rained fire
[6:21] down from heaven and consumed the AC the
[6:23] sacrifice in the presence of the king
[6:26] and presence of all the people that said
[6:28] they were believers in front of
[6:30] everyone and they left
[6:32] him thrown down thine altars and slain
[6:35] thy prophets with the sword and I even I
[6:37] only am left and they seek my life to
[6:40] take it away and he said go forth and
[6:42] stand upon the mount before the Lord and
[6:44] behold the Lord passed by and a great
[6:48] and strong wind rent the
[6:50] mountains and break in pieces the Rocks
[6:52] before the Lord but the Lord was not in
[6:55] the
[6:56] wind and after the wind and earthquake
[7:00] but the Lord was not in the
[7:02] earthquake and after the earthquake of
[7:04] fire but the Lord was not in the
[7:07] fire and after the fire a still Small
[7:11] Voice amen and it was so when Elijah
[7:14] heard it that he wrapped his face in his
[7:16] mantle and went out and stood in the
[7:18] entering of of the cave and behold there
[7:20] came a voice unto him and said what
[7:22] doest thou here
[7:23] Elijah you may be seated the Lord I his
[7:25] Blessing to the readings of the
[7:27] word I I wanted to just kind of stop in
[7:30] your mind on that verse 12 and after the
[7:33] earthquake of fire but the Lord was not
[7:35] in the fire and after the fire a still
[7:37] Small Voice because all these evidences
[7:40] came by all these things came by but but
[7:43] Elijah was comforted by only one right
[7:46] now in this crucial time in this crucial
[7:48] time of this story we got we got a story
[7:51] of Ahab that that was just B this
[7:53] borderline believer that United himself
[7:55] with Jezebel somebody that came up that
[7:58] was brother Brandon taught how she was
[8:00] came up from an early age taught in that
[8:02] balum religion that the the real true
[8:05] Faith was
[8:06] incorrect she was raised her mama and
[8:08] daddy taught her that
[8:11] and and she was raised in that kind of
[8:13] atmosphere that's see how how crucial it
[8:16] is to teach your children where you say
[8:18] I'm not a I'm not a minister but surely
[8:21] you know some kind of some piece of the
[8:23] Bible surely you can start on John 3:16
[8:26] and start with for God so loved the
[8:27] world that he gave his only begotten son
[8:30] surely you can you can try if the
[8:31] Catholics do it and they and they get a
[8:33] hold of a child at a young age and and
[8:35] it stays with them and we've got that
[8:37] promise in God's word that if you train
[8:39] up a child in the way it should go that
[8:40] when he's old he won't depart from it
[8:42] then surely we can take CLA take hold of
[8:44] God's word and apply it in our
[8:46] children's life apply it in our
[8:49] life now that's that's really what I'm
[8:52] getting at is is the only comfort that
[8:55] we have in a time of Crisis is in God's
[8:58] word right the only comfort that we have
[9:01] and if if we can reach out and take take
[9:03] a hold of God's word and believe it and
[9:05] not fear but believe it and claim it by
[9:07] faith then watch you can watch God's
[9:10] word come to
[9:12] pass now because because brother random
[9:15] said we're we're fortified behind God's
[9:18] word and you know how he taught in the
[9:20] Garden of Eden how they came back they
[9:22] came from behind that fortification and
[9:24] stepped out and and took one word off
[9:27] and and all down through history we've
[9:30] been in a crisis that started a
[9:33] crisis and we you know the greatest
[9:37] crisis there's many crisis you could be
[9:38] in a Health crisis things going wrong in
[9:40] your body things going wrong in your in
[9:42] your mind but the the greatest crisis of
[9:45] all is that that Soul sickness that
[9:47] we've you must be born again that that
[9:51] God laid the foundation laid the way
[9:53] back to him and and we've got the choice
[9:56] is is laid out in front of each of us
[9:58] whether to choose him
[9:59] or to choose wrong
[10:03] now let me just let me start off by
[10:07] reading let's actually go to go to quote
[10:10] number nine brothers I told him I was
[10:12] going to be a little out of
[10:21] order thank you my
[10:28] son
[10:29] because see the the word was was
[10:32] presented to
[10:33] Ahab and as as if you go back later
[10:37] tonight and and and study and read the
[10:39] scripture when you have a chance get
[10:41] alone in your quiet time and and maybe
[10:43] meditate on these things because Ahab he
[10:46] went over and and he
[10:48] saw you remember the story of that that
[10:51] U Elijah s Obadiah to go get Ahab and
[10:55] and bring him over here and Obadiah was
[10:56] scared and uh bring him to the where the
[10:59] the fire would fall and consume the
[11:01] sacrifice and Ahab was present when that
[11:04] happened he was present when Elijah made
[11:06] that bold statement that that just fill
[11:08] up all the trough with the water and and
[11:10] cover it over three times with the
[11:12] sacrifice and and he made that bold
[11:14] declaration that whoever who whose God
[11:17] answers let him be God and they all the
[11:20] the the uh the the non-believers stood
[11:23] around and and the Bible says that there
[11:24] was no voice to answer there was no
[11:27] voice to answer and I I I wonder maybe
[11:29] pose this question how many of us think
[11:31] as brother Brown told that story of how
[11:33] Jesus's parents left Jerusalem and they
[11:36] thought that Jesus was with them how
[11:38] many of us think that Jesus is in our
[11:40] midst but when the crisis comes along
[11:43] when the critical times along we find
[11:45] out that we've left him and the way
[11:47] brother random explained it is you got
[11:49] to go back to where you left him to get
[11:52] him now I want to speak maybe frankly to
[11:55] to to to everybody the way I speak to my
[11:58] kids is that we shouldn't uh this is a
[12:01] time of excuses of a time of trying to
[12:04] find uh little end little shortcuts and
[12:06] things but there's no excuses in the
[12:09] Bible there's this is a this is a true
[12:11] enough time a time to find out whether
[12:14] you've really got that still Small Voice
[12:16] on the inside that'll keep you in the
[12:18] time of Crisis now all these little
[12:21] things all the little emotions and and
[12:23] things they can't hold you in the time
[12:24] of Crisis you get all all all been out
[12:28] of shape by some that happens at work or
[12:30] some a medical problem or something or
[12:32] or uh whether or not you really have
[12:35] salvation and the only true peace the
[12:38] only way that you'll have true peace and
[12:40] true Joy is by that still Small Voice
[12:43] coming inside and living you and I I I
[12:45] want to just counsel you to make sure in
[12:47] this time of this critical crucial time
[12:50] to be sure that you're sure to know that
[12:53] you
[12:55] know cuz the only the only thing that
[12:58] would give give Elijah peace as all of
[13:01] these things came by the fire and the
[13:03] wind and the earthquake was that still
[13:05] Small Voice right the only thing that a
[13:08] Believer can have true comfort in is to
[13:11] know that God's word is eternal that the
[13:14] Eternal God wrote it in the in spoke it
[13:17] when he spoke it he created it's a
[13:18] creative action and he spoke it and it
[13:20] was written on the book so that when you
[13:22] believe it that creative act would
[13:24] become manifest and it would become
[13:26] manifest in your life that's why the
[13:28] believer can take a hold of God's word
[13:30] and and just lean on it like all these
[13:33] Believers that you know David had these
[13:34] three Mighty Men sorry I'm not even
[13:36] getting this quote yet give me a minute
[13:38] David David had these three mighty men
[13:40] that was that it was written of that
[13:41] they could just they were Mighty Men in
[13:44] the Old Testament because uh you think
[13:47] in the natural because they went out and
[13:48] slew a lot of people yeah now in the
[13:51] modern day you got I was reading about
[13:53] the most decorated man in the bi in in
[13:56] modern uh Army was uh uh I'm drawing a
[14:00] blank at his name now Aldi Murphy and
[14:02] and I think he he killed like 50 people
[14:06] at once ran up on top of a tank dropped
[14:08] a grenade in there and and and and did
[14:09] great explits but now here in the Old
[14:11] Testament we're talking about men that
[14:13] killed a thousand men a thousand
[14:15] Philistines 800 Philistines killed and
[14:19] they were known for their exploits
[14:20] because they uh two of David's mighty
[14:23] men were not because of how many they
[14:26] killed but because when they saw the
[14:28] enemy coming they didn't turn and run
[14:31] away right now all of these great
[14:33] exploits you think in the natural is
[14:35] because they killed a lot of people but
[14:36] their great exploits I believe is
[14:38] because they took God's word and held on
[14:41] to it they knew that David was the
[14:43] anointed and they were going to stay
[14:44] with him and stand behind him they knew
[14:47] that he was the one that was going to
[14:49] make God's word manifest and they were
[14:51] going to stay right with him no matter
[14:54] what so they reached down and took a
[14:55] hold of God's word instead it looks like
[14:58] in the natur they took a hold of a sword
[15:00] but they were taking a hold of God's
[15:01] promises and they took a hold of that
[15:03] promise and slew the enemy now in the
[15:05] New Testament that's what we're doing
[15:07] today we're taking a hold of God's
[15:08] promise and slaying the enemy all the
[15:11] doubts and all the Spooks as brother B
[15:13] said all the all the stuff that all
[15:15] these things are you can slice it and
[15:17] dice it by the by the arm of Faith
[15:19] holding that Shield of the word and
[15:21] watch it fall away if you'll cling to
[15:24] God's word his unchanging word his word
[15:28] is Eternal that's what that's what
[15:30] differentiates it
[15:32] from if if God's word is eternal and he
[15:35] puts his Eternal Word in you and you can
[15:38] believe it watch it come to pass
[15:43] Glory now look emergency we're in a a
[15:46] crisis time a critical time this is a
[15:49] critical time that we're looking at here
[15:50] in the Bible where Elijah's come to this
[15:53] this stage where the set by Ahab and
[15:55] Jezebel and all of these people in
[15:57] Israel that wouldn't believe and so God
[15:59] pulls out all the stops to get them to
[16:01] believe he comes and consumes the
[16:03] Sacrifice by fire he comes and makes a a
[16:06] public show because it God's he brings a
[16:11] famine on the land for three and a half
[16:13] years because he's trying it's critical
[16:16] the salvation of his people it's
[16:18] critical the salvation of my children I
[16:20] want my children to be saved more than
[16:22] anything in the world I want you to be
[16:24] saved more than anything in the world
[16:26] because brother brandham said the
[16:27] evidence of New Birth as those that sigh
[16:31] and cry for the Abominations down of the
[16:33] city those that are crying out for lost
[16:34] souls those are something within them
[16:37] just yearns that to see people saved and
[16:41] so that's what you can see God's spirit
[16:43] May manifest here in this little story
[16:45] of how he came down and he pulled all
[16:47] the stops think about in the Elijah of
[16:49] this day how he pulled out all the stops
[16:51] and he came down and he said and the
[16:53] Elijah that we know that we follow that
[16:57] he came down and said uh bring me your
[16:59] worst casee bring me your most hopeless
[17:02] case he'd had I was reading that he had
[17:04] crisis nights bring me your most
[17:07] critical your most crucial and and see
[17:10] them be
[17:11] healed when he went over to India and
[17:13] was challenged by the 17 the 17
[17:16] different different sex and things he
[17:18] said bring me the bring me your worst
[17:20] case and they brought up the the
[17:21] crippled and the lame and we know all
[17:22] those stories because God is interested
[17:25] he he's interested in doing whatever it
[17:28] takes
[17:29] to see you receive that still Small
[17:31] Voice the evidence is not in big emotion
[17:34] big chills and chills bumps and and song
[17:37] services and and running up and down the
[17:40] aisle but the the the evidence is that
[17:42] still Small Voice that speaks to you in
[17:45] the quill in the steal in the quiet and
[17:47] opens your word and his word and shows
[17:50] it to
[17:52] you and that way you're fortified behind
[17:55] his
[17:56] word now
[17:59] look look how this this little life
[18:01] story of how God brought his Prophet
[18:03] through through through Mount
[18:05] Caramel signs and wonders and then he
[18:08] dra brought him over to this little
[18:09] juniper tree experience where he's
[18:11] laying under up under the juniper tree
[18:13] and he's he's thinking everybody's left
[18:15] me everybody's deserted
[18:18] me and and you know brother R said maybe
[18:20] that's sometimes how ministers think
[18:22] when you as soon as you you watch soon
[18:24] as you step off of the pulpit even song
[18:27] singers and things as soon as you step
[18:29] off from the platform the devil whack
[18:31] you a good one nobody cares what you
[18:33] think no nobody wants to hear that
[18:34] nobody nobody uh nobody wants to hear
[18:38] the gospel and and and Elijah had got a
[18:40] good whack whack and and there he was
[18:43] under the juniper tree nobody cares
[18:45] nobody wants to hear it but Jes got now
[18:48] now if you keep on reading right after
[18:51] he went through this little low part
[18:53] this little low valley then out on the
[18:54] other side comes hael and and yahu and
[18:59] Elisha God uh God God said I've got
[19:02] these three waiting that they're going
[19:04] to what Eli uh What uh H doesn't kill
[19:07] y's going to kill what y doesn't kill
[19:09] Elijah is going to kill and and he went
[19:12] and right after this little story he
[19:13] goes and finds his his his little
[19:15] partner elishah and and the and the
[19:18] story just gets on keeps on moving you
[19:21] think nobody else is believing like my
[19:24] my son came came to me a few days ago
[19:27] and he says Daddy
[19:28] people are leaving the message A lot of
[19:31] people are leaving the message and you
[19:33] know one thing L it another and we
[19:34] started talking about how man it's going
[19:37] to be hard to find a spouse before
[19:41] long it's going to be hard to
[19:43] find it's going to be hard to find a a a
[19:46] real true Holy Ghost filled wife a real
[19:49] true Holy Ghost filled husband but
[19:52] remember all things are possible to them
[19:55] that believe now you know how brother br
[19:58] to you don't go hunting around somebody
[19:59] that looks real pretty you'll find
[20:01] you'll find a nice little Jezebel
[20:03] waiting for you but go looking for that
[20:05] character that's on the inside and the
[20:07] one that knows that character more than
[20:09] anybody else is the is the one that
[20:11] created us all he can see the secrets of
[20:13] the heart so that's what I tell my kids
[20:16] when you get ready to find that match
[20:18] don't go like in that uh fider on the
[20:20] roof match you make your Matchmaker but
[20:23] let him be your Matchmaker let him find
[20:25] out because the one that can see the
[20:27] innermost part of of the heart let him
[20:29] find you one let him be your
[20:32] Matchmaker because
[20:34] uh you know there's
[20:37] there's beauty is skin deep and and that
[20:41] on the outside you know you know even
[20:43] Jesus talked about uh whitewashed
[20:46] sheeples looking at the the Pharisees
[20:48] white white and clean on the outside and
[20:51] and looks real good looks like a good
[20:52] churchgoer on the outside but on the
[20:55] inside dead men's bones real good coming
[20:58] to church looking looking real good
[21:00] looking like a good Christian says all
[21:02] the things but the still Small Voice is
[21:05] not on the inside now that's what I'm
[21:07] that's what I'm talking about examine
[21:10] yourself I pray you get in your quiet
[21:12] time and examine yourself because the
[21:14] hour is late uh you you know you just
[21:18] walk out your door in the morning you
[21:19] can just feel that the hour is late
[21:21] things are moving even just just without
[21:23] even looking at the events that are
[21:25] transpiring the uh the how they coming
[21:28] up with the battery powered cars and all
[21:29] those things that brother Brown talked
[21:31] about but just just the general feel of
[21:33] the of the of the moment you know that
[21:35] the word is being manifest in somebody
[21:38] somewhere and it's time to get in before
[21:40] the doors shut and the doors are going
[21:42] to be shut not by circumstance but there
[21:44] should be shut by everybody that's in
[21:46] there that's supposed to be in there
[21:48] will be in there when everybody that's
[21:50] supposed to be in there is in there the
[21:52] doors will be shut and it'll be too late
[21:54] and the foolish virgin will turn around
[21:56] and say I I should have known that to
[21:58] receive the new birth I had to eat the
[22:00] body word of Christ I I should have
[22:02] known that to receive the new birth I
[22:04] had to eat it and receive it and feast
[22:06] on it and let that word be made manifest
[22:10] and they'll ask you for your books and
[22:12] your tapes ask you for your Revelation
[22:14] you'll say no that's for me this is for
[22:20] me where am I let's see now look he got
[22:25] down to that juniper tree experience he
[22:28] got down under the junior PR tree and
[22:30] and he looked and he he looked around
[22:32] and he was real
[22:34] low because by circumstances by just
[22:37] looking at the church looking at the
[22:39] people all he could see was
[22:42] laziness now you know brother Brown
[22:45] talked about he when Billy Paul was
[22:46] young he said he'd go up there and he
[22:48] said it looked like he had his day and
[22:50] nights mixed up and you know how young
[22:51] people are they they sleep real late and
[22:54] stay up late and and so forth and and he
[22:57] said I I'd rather you just get up in the
[22:59] morning and just go out and look at the
[23:02] car and then go back to bed instead of
[23:05] just laying up in the bed being lazy and
[23:08] see how lazy this is he said you're
[23:10] going to be filled by something some
[23:12] people going to be filled by laziness or
[23:15] they going to be filled by the spirit
[23:17] now you can almost see we make excuses
[23:20] we make excuses well well maybe I'm
[23:22] filled with a new birth but I'm just
[23:25] lazy now listen if the Eternal God is
[23:29] eternal and he's put his eternal the
[23:31] unchanging God has put his unchanging
[23:34] self inside the believer there's going
[23:37] to be something calling out something
[23:39] craving for that word there's going to
[23:41] be a deep that calls to the Deep there's
[23:43] going to be something that fights within
[23:45] you against that laziness on the
[23:48] outside now the the age that we're
[23:50] living in is laziness the age that we're
[23:52] living is this old lay out of sea and
[23:54] laad desal you know whatever you get CAU
[23:57] up in and and uh uh just uh looking at
[24:01] your phone too much or or or uh
[24:04] listening to music too much or so many
[24:06] distractions but there that still Small
[24:09] Voice will draw you like an artisian
[24:11] well a deep well calling you and pulling
[24:14] you back to the word how can an eagle
[24:17] live without meat how can you live how
[24:19] can you sustain yourself without meat
[24:21] you've got to be you've got to feed if
[24:24] you if you got that lazy Spirit on you
[24:27] check up but make sure that it's not
[24:29] just covering up the Holy Spirit but
[24:31] that you really do have that still small
[24:33] voice inside of you if there's not
[24:35] something inside of you that's hungering
[24:37] for that word that's calling out for it
[24:40] make sure that you really are filled
[24:43] with the holy spirit that you really do
[24:45] have that that voice which is the word
[24:47] living on the
[24:51] inside and you won't be afraid anymore
[24:55] right cuz perfect love casts out Fe
[24:58] fear is we were looking at in B in in in
[25:01] the little Sunday school lesson the
[25:02] other
[25:03] day you know Elijah he was kind of
[25:06] wanting Deliver Us From Fear in the Old
[25:09] Testament you know that Holy Spirit
[25:10] would come down upon him and even in the
[25:12] New Testament brother random talked
[25:14] about how he would get get under that
[25:15] anointing and it just go way up so high
[25:18] and and and he after he got done
[25:20] preaching or under that special
[25:21] anointing he he come out and he'd just
[25:23] find himself walking and and not even
[25:26] know where he was or or anything and and
[25:28] he talked about how this was the same
[25:29] kind of thing that Elijah was going
[25:31] through how he he walked for 40 days and
[25:33] 40 nights and and woke up in a cave
[25:35] didn't even know how he got there he
[25:37] just he he wandered to and fro and and
[25:40] the Lord but the Lord was keeping him
[25:42] the whole time because you know God is
[25:46] so tender and loving and he wants to
[25:49] take care of us he don't he don't want
[25:50] us
[25:53] to he wants us to be with him that's
[25:55] what he wants you think well well God is
[25:58] so loving he won't let me go through
[25:59] something well here is Elijah under the
[26:02] juniper tree and he's under the juniper
[26:04] tree because he wants to show Elijah
[26:05] something if he lets you get up under
[26:07] the Jun juniper tree he's doing it to
[26:09] draw you closer to him he's doing it so
[26:12] that you'll learn to trust him to to
[26:13] believe his word because his word is
[26:15] eternal and if you put your trust in his
[26:17] word if you don't doubt and don't fear
[26:20] watch it come to
[26:26] pass
[26:29] ah Lord help
[26:32] me so Lord so
[26:35] Elijah he gets all depressed under the
[26:38] juniper tree and he winds up in that
[26:43] cave he winds up in a cave where he can
[26:46] get
[26:47] quiet because you know a lot of times
[26:51] that's what we that that's what we need
[26:53] to do to be able to hear that still
[26:55] Small Voice we got so much activity in
[26:57] our life lives so much running to and
[26:59] fro because in this day the devil's
[27:02] going to try to keep us real busy he's
[27:04] going to give you a lots of stuff to do
[27:07] I know I'm maybe the biggest one at
[27:08] fault here in this room that many people
[27:10] say you want to go fishing brother Danny
[27:13] and I'll say sometimes well I'm busy I'm
[27:16] a't that a horrible word
[27:18] busy cuz the devil will keep us so busy
[27:21] and then you'll find a lot of times when
[27:22] you get in the car where there's just
[27:24] nobody else and you're just driving down
[27:26] the road you start meditating on the
[27:28] Lord and he'll just drop down that still
[27:31] Small Voice begins to speak to you or
[27:33] you're just maybe walking out in the in
[27:35] in the woods or fishing or whatever and
[27:37] you're all alone and and you just begin
[27:40] to think on him you know how brother
[27:41] Bram said don't blank your mind out
[27:43] don't do like the the bruus and stuff
[27:45] and oh and all that kind of stuff but
[27:48] you begin to think meditate on God's
[27:49] word think about what did Brother Dale
[27:52] say the other Sunday that I didn't
[27:54] understand or or what was he saying that
[27:56] that's really got me that there's a
[27:58] little problem in my life that Lord if
[28:00] you just help me with that and that
[28:01] still Small Voice the speaker will drop
[28:04] down and begin to just open himself up
[28:06] to you that's when you begin to Rejoice
[28:09] that's how you get the new birth is get
[28:11] just let that that get it get into the
[28:13] quiet time and meditate on his word and
[28:15] watch that word come to life watch it be
[28:19] become Quicken let that Spirit come down
[28:22] and and and water the word that you've
[28:25] heard and quiet time that little cave
[28:28] represents that represents your personal
[28:32] relationship with God oh yeah it
[28:34] represents your house it represents your
[28:37] your your little experience you know El
[28:40] our Elijah had a cave too is't that
[28:42] interesting that God gave him a
[28:44] furnished cave with a table and and a
[28:46] and a pyramid hanging over it and a
[28:48] little place to sleep because God's
[28:50] concerned about our welfare and you
[28:52] think well well well God God has
[28:55] forgotten about me God don't care about
[28:57] about me well the quickest way to get an
[28:59] answer to that is go back into his word
[29:01] and read a little bit and find out he
[29:03] much he cares about you read a little
[29:06] bit and and and get quiet with him and
[29:09] and let that Spirit go come down and and
[29:11] speak to you a little bit and you'll
[29:13] find out real quick whether he cares
[29:14] about you or
[29:22] not so if we could just grab a hold of
[29:25] God's word right
[29:28] you know one time that there was despite
[29:31] circumstances grab a hold of God's word
[29:33] despite the way things
[29:36] look cuz one time there was these three
[29:38] Hebrew children that when all the world
[29:41] it looked like nobody else
[29:43] believed and they and the the the the
[29:46] political system of the day said well
[29:48] we'll Heat this fire seven times hotter
[29:51] and they got the atmosphere just right
[29:53] because they didn't care about the
[29:54] atmosphere of that furnace they got the
[29:56] atmosphere just right and brother bram's
[29:58] taught that the atmosphere is is your
[30:00] attitude towards God God's word the way
[30:03] you look at his word and that's why that
[30:06] quiet time is so important where you can
[30:08] get along with God and get your thoughts
[30:10] lined up with his thoughts and get your
[30:12] attitude right and then you can see the
[30:14] wheels begin to turn and and that's how
[30:17] they they got their attitude right I
[30:19] know that God will deliver I know he's
[30:21] able but if he doesn't then I'm still
[30:24] not going to Bow exactly amen now that's
[30:27] how it look look Elijah was in the same
[30:30] situation Jezebel had come around and
[30:31] she killed all the prophets and he said
[30:33] I'm the only one left but yet he wasn't
[30:35] afraid to get out there and declare the
[30:39] Jehovah to all the people let let
[30:41] whoever is real God let the real God uh
[30:45] be God that that
[30:48] answers so you know the he three Hebrew
[30:50] children got down in that fire and and
[30:52] and God came on the scene because he he
[30:55] he not only came on the scene but he
[30:56] walked down in the fire with him he got
[30:59] down in there with them because they
[31:01] believed him they clung to his word just
[31:04] like the the the three Mighty Men in
[31:06] David's Army and and uh all the all the
[31:08] ones down through history all these
[31:11] mighty men that were written of in God's
[31:14] word they all had something in com
[31:16] common they took a hold of God's word
[31:18] and they didn't let it go and they got
[31:20] up and did something they just s didn't
[31:22] just sit around and lazy and and sit up
[31:24] in their proverbial recliner and and
[31:27] watch the world go by I look at up the
[31:28] the tape sitting up on the shelf and and
[31:31] uh and never listen to brother brandom
[31:33] and never listen to uh you realize how
[31:37] how blessed we are in this day you know
[31:39] in Martin Luther's day if you uh
[31:42] received a message of his day maybe a
[31:44] couple years after he died then you
[31:46] couldn't go listen to his words you
[31:49] could maybe read it on the page and and
[31:51] maybe hear a little hearsay of what
[31:53] somebody else said about what how great
[31:55] one of his sermons were but or the same
[31:57] thing with John Wesley but today we can
[31:59] put in a tape a tape and a tape player
[32:02] and press play and it just it just
[32:04] boggles me how so many refuse to do that
[32:07] even because that the the lay out of sea
[32:10] and laziness
[32:12] and that's why the same way as in Exodus
[32:16] 19 or 1 Kings chapter 19 we're in this
[32:18] this critical crucial hour crucial hour
[32:21] of who's going to be saved who's going
[32:23] to believe who's going to accept the
[32:25] message all right let's go to uh that
[32:27] quote verse uh number nine that we were
[32:29] looking
[32:36] at and the uncertain
[32:39] sound what did he what did we do a few
[32:42] days ago we did the same thing Israel
[32:43] did elected Ahab to the White
[32:46] House that was November 1960 when they
[32:49] elected
[32:50] Kennedy and and you know Kennedy uh if
[32:54] you look a lot of people he was a pretty
[32:56] nice guy yeah he had uh uh a lot of his
[32:59] agenda and everything was was good but
[33:02] the problem was the same thing as with
[33:03] Ahab was that he was yok to that yet
[33:05] Jezebel system that had a a collar on
[33:08] that would keep him back now now that
[33:10] was ahab's problem because look what
[33:12] brother R said about him Ahab was a
[33:14] pretty good sort of a fellow but he
[33:16] wanted to repent now think about that he
[33:19] wanted to repent he was there when the
[33:21] fire
[33:23] fell but Jezebel he was married to her
[33:27] and he couldn't do it she was the neck
[33:29] that turned the head now now think about
[33:32] that how many today want to repent but
[33:35] they're yolked to to a denomination well
[33:38] of course those are things are are very
[33:39] common to us Yol to a denomination yolk
[33:41] to Yol to an unbelieving wife that's why
[33:44] brother R said you you're not supposed
[33:45] to marry a Believer to an unbeliever
[33:47] because these kind of things happen an
[33:50] unbelieving wife but what about being
[33:52] yolked to your your old ideas so many
[33:55] you see that they continue to be yolked
[33:57] to their own ideas and they can't let go
[34:00] you know the new birth is is part of the
[34:02] new birth is you got to die to your old
[34:04] self you got to lay all those old ideas
[34:07] and lay all that stuff aside and and say
[34:09] Lord make me a new creation a new
[34:11] creature put make me a a new wine bottle
[34:15] so you can put new wine in me change me
[34:18] and make me new look he wanted to repent
[34:21] but Jezebel he was married to her and he
[34:23] couldn't do it she was the neck that
[34:24] turned the head and we did the same
[34:26] thing put a man up there that's married
[34:28] to that Jezebel system that we run from
[34:29] and become a free Nation from oh you
[34:32] politicians that sold your Birthright of
[34:34] Christianity you know what politics is
[34:36] is trying to get somebody to like you
[34:39] and and and now
[34:40] listen we shouldn't care about anybody
[34:43] else liking us the only person that I
[34:46] want to care about and I know we have
[34:48] problems in our own self I I want people
[34:50] to like me get don't get me wrong but
[34:52] you know you can go off off the wrong
[34:54] end with that you can start uh being a
[34:56] people pleaser and and liking that pat
[34:59] on the back and and liking everybody
[35:01] saying good things about you but the the
[35:04] only one that we should be out to please
[35:07] is that
[35:09] one is the god of
[35:11] Glory oh you politicians that sold your
[35:14] Birthright of Christianity I'll stop on
[35:15] that let's go back
[35:18] now let's go ahead and jump on down to
[35:21] number
[35:22] 10 to see what what Elijah was really
[35:27] excited about as all these different
[35:29] things came by all the now as we live
[35:32] through life many of us have been around
[35:34] for so long and I've seen so many
[35:36] different things um my my dad was
[35:39] telling me he grew up in a Pentecostal
[35:41] church and he remembers his dad telling
[35:42] him said uh little Robert jump up and
[35:44] run around the building three times and
[35:46] and and just all these things trying to
[35:48] work up something trying and brother R
[35:50] said you see people come through the
[35:51] prayer line and and want to get healed
[35:54] and one one sister came through the
[35:55] prayer line and she's just start shaking
[35:57] herself trying to get worked up but
[35:59] that's not how it is you don't get
[36:01] worked up is the
[36:03] evidence a a lot of emotion a lot of
[36:05] shaking and a lot of fire and earthquake
[36:07] and wind is not the evidence but it's
[36:10] the evidence of what what a real Comfort
[36:13] to a Christian in the time of Crisis is
[36:15] that still Small Voice that speaks his
[36:17] word
[36:18] out I I my one of my kids other other
[36:22] day said Daddy whenever you start
[36:23] preaching you get to stuttering a lot
[36:25] well I might stutter a little bit but
[36:26] Lord willing you'll remember it with
[36:30] with stammering lips and other tongues
[36:33] right so so we're reading uh uh number
[36:37] 10 God hiding himself in Simplicity than
[36:40] revealing himself in the same when
[36:42] Elijah was back in that cave the smoke
[36:44] went across blood thunder lightning and
[36:46] sea and all these kind of Sensations
[36:47] we've had blood in the face and in the
[36:49] hands and Sensations and everything they
[36:51] they never bother that prophet he just
[36:54] laid there but he heard a Ste Small
[36:57] Voice what was it the word then he
[37:01] covered his face and walked out see that
[37:05] was it now I'm going get to that in a
[37:06] second but he he was interested in the
[37:10] word he was interested in the books and
[37:14] the tapes that line on your wall he was
[37:16] interested in coming to church to hear
[37:18] what the minister had to say he was
[37:20] interested in receiving the message for
[37:23] the
[37:25] day not interested in all these little
[37:27] distractions and things that go along
[37:30] you know just just growing up in the
[37:32] message that seems like just through
[37:34] through the things I I've seen is for
[37:37] many years it seemed like it was taught
[37:39] that that you know you well how do you
[37:41] get the near birth where you just go uh
[37:44] wait for something wait for that fire
[37:47] wait for that earthquake or wait for
[37:49] that wind wait for something to come
[37:51] along and and and
[37:54] well thank God for the truth that we
[37:56] know know how to get a new birth that
[37:58] that that Parable that brother Dell has
[38:00] been been preaching on the SE went forth
[38:02] to se the words got to be sown into your
[38:04] heart and then it's got to be watered by
[38:07] the spirit and it'll come up and you see
[38:10] what's in the ground is made
[38:12] manifest see how how simple the gospel
[38:15] is we just thank God for the
[38:17] truth and I I I I really you know that
[38:20] that little cave experience I've really
[38:21] been trying to hammer it on to my kids
[38:24] because I want my kids at least if they
[38:26] don't if they grow up and and don't see
[38:28] things the way I see it at least I want
[38:30] them to understand the way I see it and
[38:33] I I I encourage everybody to do that
[38:35] make sure that your little cave your
[38:37] little dwelling is is Sanctified and
[38:39] holy in a place where everybody in your
[38:42] home at least knows what you believe and
[38:44] I my my kids they've started coming up
[38:47] to me Daddy I don't understand why uh
[38:50] because I tell them you should be able
[38:51] to explain what you believe not not be
[38:54] like when I grew up but why don't you
[38:55] have a TV in your your house or why
[38:57] don't you why don't y'all do this and
[38:59] that well I don't know cuz my parents
[39:01] you know you should be able to at least
[39:03] have an answer have a reason of the hope
[39:05] that lies within you to to declare they
[39:07] they'll come up and say well Daddy why
[39:09] why is it wrong for women to wear makeup
[39:11] and things well well look at the only
[39:13] one in the Bible that wore makeup
[39:15] because to to to to to attract this man
[39:19] yo that was riding up to kill her and
[39:21] she put all this makeup on her face and
[39:23] batted her eyes out the window and try
[39:24] to try to change his mind and then
[39:27] whoops he rode her over with a chariot
[39:30] now the only one in the Bible that that
[39:32] wore makeup like that and you know
[39:33] another thing is because the the gospel
[39:35] teaches that that we shouldn't be
[39:37] Hypocrites we should we shouldn't be
[39:39] fake on the outside you know all these
[39:41] actors and stuff they put on that goop
[39:43] all in the movies and stuff but a real
[39:45] Christian should let that gospel glow
[39:47] come out let that that that real gospel
[39:50] Glo be seen on the outside you don't
[39:51] have to cover all that up with a bunch
[39:53] of goop and everything you don't have to
[39:55] dress up like the world separate
[39:57] yourself and sanctify yourself we were
[39:59] at the grocery store the I'm I'm getting
[40:02] off a little bit we were at the grocery
[40:03] store and we we looked over and we saw
[40:05] this lady she looked just like maybe
[40:07] that that story that brother around
[40:08] talked about that I I thought I thought
[40:10] her gallbladder busted or something CU
[40:12] she had all this it it was the worst
[40:14] case of of makeup that I I I think I've
[40:17] ever seen it was it was a mess but
[40:20] anyway God God wants us to be real
[40:22] genuine he wants us to be to to let our
[40:25] light shine and how's you like got shine
[40:26] going going to shine through a bunch of
[40:28] stuff all over your face you don't have
[40:30] to wear a mask that's
[40:33] right and I didn't know I was going to
[40:35] get on that
[40:38] but now
[40:42] listen that that that voice that still
[40:45] Small Voice and that voice you know when
[40:48] John the Baptist came on the scene he
[40:50] said I am the voice of one crying in the
[40:53] wilderness but now listen when Moses
[40:55] went in behind the Tabernacle he said
[40:57] the voice of one spoke to me from from
[41:01] The Mercy Seat when Ezekiel Saw that the
[41:03] wheel in the middle of the wheel and the
[41:05] cherubims and everything he said the
[41:07] voice of one spoke to me the voice of
[41:10] one is not just a man the voice of one
[41:13] in this day is not just the man the
[41:15] voice of one is the is the one that
[41:17] created us the the god of Heaven the
[41:20] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[41:22] was that anointing that he the Bible
[41:23] says that he was filled with the holy
[41:25] ghost from his mother's womb and he came
[41:26] out filled and we know we know how to
[41:29] explain that now that the Holy Ghost
[41:31] came upon him not filling his soul but
[41:34] came upon him anointing him into the
[41:36] service of the Lord because until Jesus
[41:38] died the Holy Ghost could not come and
[41:40] give someone a new birth because uh uh
[41:43] we're the Holy Ghost W only come into a
[41:45] clean vessel and his blood had to die to
[41:47] sanctify us the voice of one crying in
[41:50] the wilderness and that same voice has
[41:52] to speak from within you to give you
[41:54] comfort in this crisis time right so I
[41:57] want to ask what what is your
[41:59] comfort is your comfort emotional work
[42:03] up like we heard brother brand speaking
[42:04] of is it is it when the singing starts
[42:06] everybody gets all excited when the
[42:08] singing starts and when the word stops
[42:09] everybody falls asleep and starts
[42:11] looking at their watch when is it time
[42:12] to go home what is your comfort is it
[42:15] shaking hands or signing a book as many
[42:18] denominational do and and or speaking in
[42:21] tongues you
[42:22] know I I I did I
[42:26] this might you got to be careful saying
[42:28] stuff like this because it almost sounds
[42:30] like you're uh I'm I'm g go ahead and
[42:32] tell this story the only time I I've
[42:35] ever spoke in tongues was I when I was a
[42:36] little boy and this was I'm telling the
[42:39] story because it was way before I got
[42:40] the new birth now when I was a little
[42:42] boy my parents they they uh they you
[42:45] know I kind of with you as as kids do
[42:47] they kind of uh get to preaching a
[42:50] little have a little mini service and
[42:52] everything so my parents would get me
[42:53] out there and i' I'd preach a little
[42:55] sermon and everything well one time I
[42:56] was preaching and and without the new
[42:59] birth and and the Holy Spirit came down
[43:02] on me and I got to I got to move a
[43:03] little bit and everybody in the room
[43:05] started looking at me funny you just
[43:07] started speaking another language now
[43:09] that's how the real the real speaking in
[43:11] tongues Works you're not you're not uh
[43:13] working something up I didn't even know
[43:15] I was speaking in tongues I I was just
[43:17] going along and but but now this was
[43:20] year this was when I was like N9 or 10
[43:21] years old way way before the New Birth
[43:24] because speaking in tongues is an
[43:26] attribute it's not uh it's something
[43:29] it's an attribute of the Holy Spirit but
[43:32] but way this was way before uh the new
[43:34] birth and I
[43:35] I so so what is your comfort is your
[43:39] comfort a good lineage like many in the
[43:41] message believe that that if you can
[43:43] trace your lineage back and I I I tried
[43:46] uh tracing my lineage back a little bit
[43:48] and you know you find some surprises in
[43:53] there now what if we could trace our
[43:56] lineage back all the way you know what
[43:57] would you do when it when it stops on
[43:59] somebody that's that was a murderer or
[44:01] or something something horrible uh we
[44:04] can't we can't put our dependent our
[44:06] comfort on vain genealogy as Paul said
[44:09] is your dependency on signs and wonders
[44:11] you know you look through the message
[44:12] and you see so many growing up I heard I
[44:16] heard ministers saying they would had
[44:17] put credibility to to their Ministry
[44:19] because of a miracle that happened in
[44:21] their Ministry or or or because of of I
[44:24] remember some of the some seemed like
[44:26] some of the greatest preachers that you
[44:28] could ever hear they get up behind the
[44:29] pit and just sweat and and and fling a
[44:32] spit everywhere and and and and and just
[44:35] nailing it down and then a few years
[44:37] later you found out they run off some
[44:38] woman down in Florida or something and
[44:41] so what what is the evidence what is the
[44:44] Comfort exactly right is it is it
[44:46] getting all excited is it is it it doing
[44:49] all these things that our distraction to
[44:51] the real evidence the real truth that
[44:53] steal Small Voice right that so easily
[44:56] overlooked in fact it's so overlooked
[44:58] you got to you got to be real quiet you
[45:00] got to get along get along with God and
[45:02] just let him
[45:04] speak but we want to get all worked up
[45:07] is it crying now I'm going get on myself
[45:09] a little bit cuz many many have said I I
[45:12] I hear what well I know brother Bob's
[45:14] got the got the new birth because he
[45:16] cries a lot now listen that's not my
[45:20] evidence because I cry a lot it's not my
[45:23] evidence you know I you know they they
[45:25] call Isaiah the we Prophet because he
[45:26] cried and and all these things but
[45:28] crying is nothing new you can just get
[45:30] emotional and get real real excited and
[45:32] everything and all the tears start to
[45:33] flow but but we're not looking for just
[45:36] emotion we're not looking for a bunch of
[45:37] crying or a bunch or
[45:39] feeling
[45:41] a like you know brother Dale's always
[45:43] said you can get a good feeling maybe
[45:45] about just dropping an ice cube down
[45:46] your back if that's what you're
[45:51] after or extraordinary humility
[45:56] because you look around and and you look
[45:58] and see well I I want to find somebody
[46:00] that's so Meek and so humble but you
[46:03] know a lot of times that's not the
[46:05] evidence right because you know look at
[46:08] look at Paul that came roaring out and
[46:09] and blasted it and told it like it was
[46:11] and I was I was reading about this uh
[46:14] this famous preacher in the 300s that
[46:17] called John golden mouth and they he was
[46:19] such a fantastic preacher that they
[46:21] wanted him down in Rome so they this
[46:23] this fellow got him he actually piled
[46:25] all this Mone on him and said I'm
[46:26] forcing you to move to Rome and you're
[46:27] going to be my preacher so he got over
[46:29] there and he didn't stop preaching he
[46:31] just laid it down on the line he just he
[46:33] just kept blasting it and he G all the
[46:35] money they gave him he gave it away and
[46:37] what ended up happening was he they they
[46:39] ended up killing him because he wouldn't
[46:41] stop preaching the truth now now so what
[46:44] we're not after we're not after somebody
[46:46] that's all wishy-washy and and real
[46:47] sweet and humble and everything but
[46:49] somebody that will take a hold of God's
[46:51] word like shamgar and and all these
[46:53] these mighty men in the Bible like the
[46:54] three Hebrew children take a hold of it
[46:56] and swing that sword of the word and
[46:58] knock down the enemy tear down all those
[47:00] Spooks and all that falseness and all
[47:02] that all that stuff tear down all the
[47:05] lies that the devil tells you that that
[47:07] that it's not it's not for you that you
[47:09] can't you can't be healed you can't be
[47:10] saved swing that word just like Jesus
[47:13] did when the devil came to him and said
[47:14] and said uh won't you turn this these Lo
[47:17] these stones into the bread and he said
[47:19] isn't it written it's written that man
[47:22] should not live by bread alone by by
[47:23] every word that comes from the mouth of
[47:25] God
[47:26] won't you cast yourself down from the
[47:27] won't the Angels come and pick you up
[47:29] it's written that thou shalt not tempt
[47:31] the Lord thy God and he he took Jesus
[47:34] Took up he knew how to take up the sword
[47:36] of the world and swing it at the Devil
[47:38] and it'll feat the devil every time if
[47:39] you resist the devil resist it by just
[47:42] turning away throw the word at him and
[47:46] and he'll flee from you every
[47:50] time and you know I I just wrote this
[47:53] little quote down about how brother
[47:54] Brown said that sin
[47:56] starts in a feeling you think well it's
[47:59] right because it's a feeling it's a real
[48:02] good feeling but Christians aren't based
[48:04] on feelings right your healing your
[48:08] salvation everything in your Christian
[48:10] walk is not based in a feeling it's
[48:12] based on faith in God's word that you
[48:15] can look in God's word and say this is
[48:17] for me I claim it and you reach down and
[48:19] grab up that sword like shamard let
[48:21] running around he saw the Philistines
[48:23] come marching he saw the enemy come
[48:24] marching and he looked around I don't
[48:25] have a sword all he had was an ox good
[48:28] so he reached down by faith and he got
[48:30] to swinging that thing around his head
[48:31] and before long he had killed 800 Phil
[48:35] Philistines by by great agility by his
[48:39] ninja skills by by his Taekwondo no by
[48:43] his faith in God's word that God would
[48:46] bring it to pass if somebody would just
[48:48] s step up and and get up and go after
[48:52] that still Small
[48:53] Voice now those three those three uh
[48:56] brother Brown said the night ter the
[48:58] Terrors came by at the night Elijah was
[49:00] waiting for that comfort and when he
[49:02] heard it right yep it amen when he heard
[49:05] it what did he
[49:07] do it says and after the earthquake of
[49:10] fire but the Lord was not in the fire
[49:13] exactly right and after the fire still
[49:16] Small
[49:19] Voice Now many today have heard the
[49:23] voice they've heard the voice preach
[49:25] that's right they've heard the voice on
[49:28] the tapes they've heard the gospel even
[49:31] spelled out on the websites and just
[49:33] laid out with all the evidence just the
[49:36] same way as they did then where the fire
[49:39] came down and consumed it right in front
[49:41] of them but now Elijah did something
[49:43] that many today won't
[49:46] do it was so when Elijah heard it that
[49:50] he wrapped his face in his mantel and
[49:53] went out right and stood in the entering
[49:56] end of the
[49:57] cave now that's what you've got to do
[50:00] because God he's given us a free moral
[50:03] agency he lays it in front of you and he
[50:07] is it's almost like he he won't move
[50:11] until you do first he's waiting on you
[50:14] to move first you got to say I believe
[50:17] it right before he will move and make it
[50:20] manifest and we were looking at the
[50:22] little bible study downstairs that if
[50:25] you have perfect love if that still
[50:27] still Small Voice is living inside of
[50:31] you and drives out all the fear then you
[50:35] can lay claim to God's promises and grab
[50:38] a hold to it and say I'm Not
[50:40] Afraid what brother brand said I'm not
[50:43] afraid that I can live this word I'm not
[50:47] afraid that you will keep your
[50:49] word are you
[50:52] afraid now that's a qu that seems like
[50:55] almost a silly
[50:57] question because of course your response
[50:59] is no but when you go home tonight and
[51:02] you're fac by the crisis at work the
[51:04] crisis of just living the crisis of
[51:06] things going wrong in your body as you
[51:08] get older the crisis of your children
[51:11] needing
[51:13] salvation where is your
[51:15] comfort can you reach reach out and
[51:18] without fear grab a hold of God's word
[51:20] and say I know that even though my
[51:22] children aren't believing right now
[51:24] there's a promise
[51:26] I'm going grab hold of that and
[51:28] believe and believe that the promise
[51:31] when he said the I am the Lord thy God
[51:33] that Health all thy diseases you can
[51:36] grab a hold of that and say well I know
[51:38] that that's for me he might be testing
[51:40] me a little bit right now and and put me
[51:42] under the juniper tree but the promise
[51:44] is for me because it's written in his
[51:46] word do you believe
[51:54] that now now see see I you know uh uh
[52:00] Jude I believe it was Jude he said who
[52:04] would want to be a preacher because you
[52:06] know I saying all these things you know
[52:09] and and then the devil he you know he'll
[52:11] you you make a confession and the devil
[52:13] will come right after you to see if you
[52:15] believe it or not you make a statement
[52:18] you got to you got to live it but
[52:21] there's one greater than there's the one
[52:24] there's one living in inside of me
[52:25] that's greater than all the
[52:27] circumstances all the crisis of this
[52:30] world and I
[52:33] can I can boldly say that I believe
[52:37] it because there's you know brother
[52:40] brandom he
[52:45] uh oh here it is that's just timely this
[52:49] quote's laying right under my finger
[52:51] let's go to number
[52:54] eight
[52:57] convinced and
[53:00] concerned y'all doing all right just
[53:02] give me 15 more
[53:04] minutes he never waited to learn how to
[53:06] do or said now wait a minute I'm the
[53:09] Royal seed I'm the Seed of Abraham I'm
[53:10] circumsized so you know all these
[53:12] Philistines are good
[53:13] Warriors wait learn how to do it now you
[53:16] think you think I got to I got to go
[53:18] study a lot I got to go look and read
[53:20] about all all these theologians and
[53:22] stuff said a lot of the theologians
[53:24] don't even know what what the Bible's
[53:26] talking about that how are you going to
[53:27] know what the Bible's really talking
[53:28] about without that still Small Voice
[53:30] living on the inside to teach you you
[53:32] don't you don't need to go learn how to
[53:34] duel shamgar didn't learn how to duel
[53:37] right he just reached down and grabbed
[53:40] up that grabbed grabbed up that Ox goe
[53:42] by the word and and and believe God's
[53:46] word now wait a minute I'm the Royal
[53:48] seat on the seat of Abraham I'm
[53:50] circumcised so you know all these
[53:51] Philistines are good Warriors they've
[53:52] been practicing a long time I'll go down
[53:54] to the c c and get my PhD and lld and I
[53:57] learn how to do I'll learn the catechism
[53:59] all the church rules if he had done that
[54:02] that's all he would have know anything
[54:04] about y he'd have only know that and he
[54:06] couldn't have whipped it then he
[54:07] couldn't have matched the enemy y now
[54:09] here's the key you can't match the enemy
[54:12] right I can't match it but I remember
[54:15] I'm living under a promise Hallelujah
[54:18] that's already his powers has been more
[54:20] than matched and conquered and cast down
[54:23] I'm more than a conqueror right now not
[54:26] myself but I'm in him who conquered him
[54:28] for me see and that lives forth I'm part
[54:31] of the royal Seed of Abraham think of it
[54:33] a minute then get your Ox sced run that
[54:36] devil of Doubt away from you yes so you
[54:39] should not be afraid to say I believe
[54:41] God's word because you're not the one
[54:43] that has to keep it right you put it
[54:45] back on God's hand say God I believe
[54:48] your word and he's the one that will
[54:50] make it come to pass you can't make one
[54:53] hair black or white you can't add one
[54:55] one inch to your stature by thinking
[54:57] about it a while but he's the one that
[55:00] can bring it to pass you can't match the
[55:02] enemy but he
[55:07] can so
[55:14] now stay B fortified behind his
[55:19] word lay hold to
[55:21] it and believe it because we're living
[55:25] in perilous times a crisis time an
[55:29] emergency time now look Elijah got up
[55:32] when he heard that still Small Voice and
[55:35] an emergency requires immediate action
[55:37] right that's what when you hear the
[55:39] still Small Voice you know growing up it
[55:42] it seems like I I just kept you know I
[55:45] know how young people do they they they
[55:46] keep hearing that call repent repent and
[55:50] then well one of these days I'm I'm not
[55:52] quite ready yet repent but and emergency
[55:55] an urgent call requires immediate action
[55:59] right when the call goes out when when
[56:01] when we're at working the fire alarm
[56:03] goes off you don't just Dilly datle in
[56:05] fact if you do Dilly datle they've got
[56:07] people assigned to go around and make
[56:09] sure you get up and go out the building
[56:13] and that's what I'm doing here behind
[56:14] this pullit I'm encouraging you I'm
[56:17] raising an alarm get up and go because
[56:20] the alarm is sounding get up because
[56:23] it's going to be too late one of these
[56:25] days there's an emergency requires
[56:29] immediate action and and you know this
[56:31] that you let this layout of seeing
[56:33] Spirit just get o get over on you until
[56:35] you just you
[56:37] just you you just start looking you get
[56:40] hypnotized like like that zombie brother
[56:44] Louise you you just
[56:46] start you know you just but but the the
[56:51] way to get that
[56:53] uh yeah
[56:57] the way to the way to get out of that
[57:00] glare to this layout of sea and age is
[57:01] to get in God's word and and stay
[57:03] focused exactly right but look now that
[57:06] that voice that's calling I believe that
[57:08] voice has called the same thing all down
[57:11] Through the Ages this message has been
[57:13] the same and it's been a real simple
[57:15] message and we know we we know the the
[57:18] the formula is that is that you must
[57:19] hear the word first and believe it and
[57:22] let it be quickened to bring forth life
[57:25] and I want to maybe just present you
[57:27] with this one word today and that one
[57:30] word is repent because that one word has
[57:33] has
[57:35] uh that's that's the message that Jesus
[57:37] pre preached that's the message that
[57:39] John preached that repent for the
[57:41] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and the the
[57:44] disciples went forth and and they told
[57:45] everybody they needed to repent the
[57:47] first words out of Peter's mouth on the
[57:49] day of Pentecost was
[57:51] repent and then and be baptized in the
[57:53] name of the Lord Jesus for the remission
[57:55] of sin and the promise shall be for you
[57:58] and to your children and and so forth
[58:01] because now look you could take a hold
[58:03] of that promise and repent
[58:06] repent we we know the technical
[58:08] definition is is you know turn around
[58:09] and and go the other way but maybe I
[58:11] want to just put a different spin to it
[58:13] repent is get up get up and and and God
[58:16] forgive me God ask God to forgive you
[58:19] and and repent for all the things that
[58:21] that you've done and give yourself to
[58:23] God that that's what that voice is
[58:25] calling out for that voice
[58:29] is the voice is crying out for the
[58:32] people to repent and give over to God
[58:36] Amen you know brother Bram told this
[58:38] little story of of Al forar that he said
[58:41] uh do I need to do I need to get maybe
[58:43] he had a lot of money and do I need to
[58:45] get a hotel room so I can be have a
[58:48] little place off to the side and
[58:49] everything brother Adam said that's not
[58:51] necessary God can meet you right
[58:53] Wherever You Are that's in your bedroom
[58:56] beside your bed he can meet you after
[58:58] church at the at the altar he can meet
[59:00] you wherever wherever you're willing to
[59:02] get up like like Elijah did and follow
[59:05] after the voice he was Elijah had
[59:08] something different about it because he
[59:10] he he he was motivated by that voice not
[59:15] by the not by all the distractions and
[59:20] everything in Matthew 4:17 it says from
[59:23] that time Jesus began toe preach Y and
[59:26] to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven
[59:28] is at
[59:29] hand and Mark 612 and they went out and
[59:33] preach that men should
[59:35] repent I'm going to just pause here and
[59:37] get some water cuz I'm about to I'm
[59:39] going be in a Thirsty Camel
[59:45] again just give me another 10 minutes or
[59:53] so
[1:00:00] so what would the voice say
[1:00:02] today I believe the voice would say
[1:00:05] repent let's go to number
[1:00:23] 13
[1:00:25] God will send the
[1:00:26] Elijah right just as certain as I'm
[1:00:29] standing in this pullit he will send and
[1:00:31] that Elijah will shake the people right
[1:00:32] straight back to the original
[1:00:33] Pentecostal Doctrine now start out at
[1:00:36] Pentecost and see how it was see what
[1:00:38] they did say if it'll be shaking hands
[1:00:40] and it'll be right straight back and
[1:00:43] when Peter preached on the day of
[1:00:44] Pentecost up there when they was all
[1:00:46] filled with the Holy Ghost and speaking
[1:00:47] in other tongues these men said now what
[1:00:50] can we do to get it Peter said repent
[1:00:53] right every one of you
[1:00:55] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:00:56] Christ for the remission of your
[1:01:00] sins let's go to number
[1:01:14] 14 what's the message going to be to
[1:01:16] Israel scroll on down to where I got it
[1:01:17] highlighted that's just before the
[1:01:19] tribulation period see oh how wonderful
[1:01:21] also Jacob's trouble here's when the 144
[1:01:24] th000 has called out they the preachers
[1:01:26] them two prophets they preach like John
[1:01:28] the Baptist the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[1:01:30] hand repent Israel right repent what
[1:01:34] repent from your sins and your unbelief
[1:01:36] and turn back to God am now there's the
[1:01:39] problem that they had back then
[1:01:40] everybody thought that they were okay
[1:01:43] everybody everybody uh sat sat around
[1:01:46] believing that they were Believers
[1:01:47] believing that they were okay and and
[1:01:49] failing to repent because the first step
[1:01:51] to repenting is to realize that
[1:01:53] something's wrong right something's off
[1:01:55] kilter those men outside on the day of
[1:01:58] Pentecost they didn't really they didn't
[1:01:59] know there was anything to repent from
[1:02:01] until Peter came out filled with the
[1:02:03] Holy Ghost and opened up their eyes and
[1:02:05] took the veil off from their eyes and
[1:02:08] then they could see that there was
[1:02:09] something wrong with the condition they
[1:02:11] were living in and then they could
[1:02:16] repent and look at number
[1:02:21] 15 Peter was led to say on acts 238 how
[1:02:24] to receive the Holy Ghost he said repent
[1:02:27] every one of you then be baptized in the
[1:02:29] name of Jesus Christ for remission of
[1:02:31] your sins and then the guide will take
[1:02:33] you from there
[1:02:35] on then the guide repent right now see
[1:02:40] there's that just one word sewn into the
[1:02:42] heart and receive in that good ground
[1:02:44] Let It Grow repent now you can do
[1:02:47] something about it if you see it if you
[1:02:49] see you got to do it repent repent of
[1:02:52] your sins your unbelief that You'
[1:02:53] disbelieved these things now see that's
[1:02:56] the pro one of my favorite little songs
[1:02:58] that this little church sings is is
[1:02:59] don't let this gospel we have become
[1:03:02] common to you right because this gospel
[1:03:05] becomes common over the years the people
[1:03:07] in the message just sit in the Pew year
[1:03:09] after year until it we start to think
[1:03:11] well now I know everything I know all
[1:03:13] about it and and and really you you
[1:03:15] start to get that that laziness that
[1:03:18] that feeling that I don't need to repent
[1:03:20] anymore when you're the one that needs
[1:03:22] to repent more than anybody else
[1:03:24] right you're sitting here right under
[1:03:26] the word and and failing to realize that
[1:03:28] you need to
[1:03:31] repent I I hope you receive that in the
[1:03:33] right Spirit first repent of your sins
[1:03:36] your unbelief that you disbelieve these
[1:03:38] things repent and then be baptized and
[1:03:41] then the guide will take you from their
[1:03:43] own see that's your
[1:03:46] duty it's your duty to repent right and
[1:03:50] and not just before you receive the new
[1:03:53] birth but after after you receive the
[1:03:55] new birth just going to work getting
[1:03:57] come home from the work and you've been
[1:03:59] slopping through work and it got all
[1:04:00] that mud on you Lord forgive me forgive
[1:04:04] me forgive me and you just keep on
[1:04:06] repenting it's your duty to repent I
[1:04:09] ain't got nothing to repent of it's your
[1:04:11] duty and it's your duty what he says
[1:04:13] it's your duty to be
[1:04:15] baptized then it's the God's duty to
[1:04:19] take you from their own lead you from
[1:04:20] virtue to knowledge to Temperance to
[1:04:23] patience to God and the brotherly love
[1:04:25] and the Holy Ghost seals you you do your
[1:04:27] duty and then he'll do his you can't
[1:04:29] even claim hold to God's word you can't
[1:04:32] even claim hold of his promises in the
[1:04:34] right way until after you've got the one
[1:04:36] that made the promise living inside of
[1:04:39] you and fail to see that you need to
[1:04:41] repent I wish there was a way that I
[1:04:43] could say the right word to just open up
[1:04:45] the take the tear the veil off the
[1:04:47] people's eyes that that that maybe if
[1:04:50] not now at home when you're at home
[1:04:52] alone to get by beside your bed and say
[1:04:54] God I I just want to lay all this at
[1:04:57] your altar I just want to lay all this
[1:04:59] at your feet and all the stuff that I
[1:05:01] can't get rid of in my life and
[1:05:02] everything that my family's not serving
[1:05:04] you Lord if you just take it all and and
[1:05:07] take control of my life that's that's
[1:05:10] the way to do it just put it all on his
[1:05:12] put it all on him and let it be his duty
[1:05:16] do your duty and repent and then watch
[1:05:18] him fulfill his
[1:05:23] word
[1:05:24] and the Holy Ghost seals you see then
[1:05:26] you're a full stature of God a real man
[1:05:29] of God a real woman of God anchored away
[1:05:32] in Christ I love that that anchored away
[1:05:36] in
[1:05:38] Christ let's keep on going let's go to
[1:05:40] number
[1:05:41] 16 let's let's uh this may be a real
[1:05:44] simple message tonight but you know
[1:05:48] sometimes that's what we need is
[1:05:51] Simplicity desperation is number 16 uh
[1:05:56] because he he was talking on
[1:05:58] desperations and and desperations comes
[1:06:01] in a crisis in a critical time now we
[1:06:04] should all be in
[1:06:06] desperations here we are right at the
[1:06:08] hour right at the moment of that that
[1:06:10] all my life I've been looking for the
[1:06:12] body change and here it seems like right
[1:06:15] at this crucial moment everybody's
[1:06:17] getting in a state of Slumber in a state
[1:06:20] of rest
[1:06:22] where this should be the most we should
[1:06:25] be more on fire at this hour at this
[1:06:28] time than any other time in history so
[1:06:31] what's wrong what's wrong with
[1:06:33] us something arises and when they do
[1:06:35] then it throws them into that
[1:06:37] desperation and really and doing that in
[1:06:39] desperation that brings out that real
[1:06:41] thing that you are how about that
[1:06:44] desperation squeezes out what's really
[1:06:47] on the inside and makes it manifest and
[1:06:49] there's coming a manifesting time
[1:06:51] there's coming a squeeze that's going to
[1:06:53] squeeze that out what's really on the
[1:06:55] inside inside and it's I believe it's
[1:06:57] here now it's upon us it's the
[1:06:59] manifesting time is is revealing who
[1:07:02] really has that still Small Voice and
[1:07:04] who just built upon emotions and things
[1:07:06] like that and really and doing that in
[1:07:08] desperation it brings out that real
[1:07:10] thing that you are it shows what you're
[1:07:11] made out of in the time of desperation
[1:07:14] it usually pulls out all the good things
[1:07:17] that's in you in time of death I've
[1:07:19] heard people when they know they were
[1:07:21] dying the things that they kept secret
[1:07:23] on all their life they in desperation
[1:07:26] they were trying to confess it now isn't
[1:07:29] that sad waiting until that last minute
[1:07:32] squeeze when they know that they're
[1:07:33] passing beyond the curtain and then they
[1:07:36] wait until then until that squeeze to
[1:07:39] confess to God why not now why not
[1:07:42] confess now why not repent now why not
[1:07:45] make sure you're right
[1:07:47] now why not get everything lined up and
[1:07:50] make sure there's no loose holes make
[1:07:52] sure there's no gaps make sure make sure
[1:07:54] you haven't taken any shortcuts make
[1:07:56] sure that you haven't looked at the
[1:07:57] wrong evidence and make sure that you're
[1:08:00] sure
[1:08:02] right take this and make it right go
[1:08:05] please go go do see in desperation they
[1:08:07] ought to have done that beforehand see
[1:08:08] not wait till the time of emergency will
[1:08:11] you do so and so for me the emergency
[1:08:13] causes desperation when we ought to do
[1:08:15] it without the
[1:08:20] emergency I'm finishing up in just a
[1:08:22] second
[1:08:27] actually the musicians can go ahead and
[1:08:29] come on up because I'm I'm going to wrap
[1:08:30] up in just a
[1:08:32] second and see what see what Elijah is
[1:08:34] looking
[1:08:36] for in number
[1:08:39] 17 and the message
[1:08:43] look Elijah he one day when he was
[1:08:45] looking for something to come to bring
[1:08:48] help to the people he looked and he
[1:08:51] looked to the old man 80s something
[1:08:53] years old was too tired to climb the
[1:08:54] mountain after been fasting praying but
[1:08:57] God told him if they would
[1:08:58] repent something would
[1:09:02] happen you remember that when Elijah
[1:09:04] came on the scene in First Kings chapter
[1:09:06] 17 he caused the famine in the land yeah
[1:09:10] cuz God's squeezing everybody squeezing
[1:09:12] out something putting desperation on
[1:09:14] people and if they would repent and then
[1:09:18] the rain would come but God told him if
[1:09:21] they would repent something would happen
[1:09:22] what was he looking he sent his servant
[1:09:24] up said go up and look look something is
[1:09:26] going to happen 3 years and a half and
[1:09:28] no rain not a cloud not even DW falling
[1:09:31] but said go look and Elijah or gazi
[1:09:33] stood and looked and looked and looked
[1:09:34] he didn't see nothing he come back down
[1:09:36] he said I didn't see nothing go back
[1:09:38] again amen go back and stay till it
[1:09:41] happens and Elijah goes back around me
[1:09:43] gazi and he looks and looks and looks
[1:09:45] and Elijah that little bald head sitting
[1:09:46] there in the Sun and his whiskers and
[1:09:48] his beard white beard and then little
[1:09:50] bony looking arms across his bony knees
[1:09:52] he said Lord God as he began to pray he
[1:09:54] said go back again now what was he doing
[1:09:57] he was looking for God to take care of
[1:09:59] his promise no matter how brassy she
[1:10:02] looked how much judgment is upon it
[1:10:04] right are you looking for God to make
[1:10:07] his promise now look the Elijah in this
[1:10:09] day when that voice screamed out
[1:10:11] screaming out for repentance is
[1:10:14] screaming out now to repent and to come
[1:10:17] to Jesus and that voice is not just a
[1:10:19] man but it's the voice of
