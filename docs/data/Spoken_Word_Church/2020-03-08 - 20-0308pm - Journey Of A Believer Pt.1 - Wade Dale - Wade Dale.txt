you awake did y'all put them buzzards under the seat like I told you the but Tony did you put the buzzer under there so we you got your Bibles let's turn to the book of Galatians we're going to we're gonna take a turn here and we were talking yesterday with the youth and I think that we will speak today and if we get done that's okay but about Abraham and his journey because it's been spoken up many times before but let's kind of put it into into us walking the same way he walked because he came from Abram to Abraham you and I came from whoever you were till now I also remember before we get get started thank you everybody that worked yesterday for the youth that's a pretty long day for everybody my sister June got all the pizza and all your other sisters came helped and you brothers thank you for for you know we had a fire pit last night and they slayed the devil out there in the parking lot while we had a Bible studying and they got a lot we got a lot accomplished I think yesterday would be you so just thank a brother thank the sister remember dad's surgery will be Tuesday at 1 o'clock let me remind you something I've had this same surgery before just because the black thing is like right here and right here his shoulder is what was operated on because when you when you shake his hand don't put your hand on his shoulder that's where he had the operation that was the worst thing I told the doctor I said why'd you put all this stuff down here I said you need to have a big old sign that says do not touch because this is the cert you're not people pat you on the back over there hugging that don't do that for at least for a little while just shake the right hand and say god bless you you don't have to reach over there and pat him on the back you know because it's gonna jar all this up here and trust me it's it's an ordeal for a little while so just keep them in your prayer and that everything will be fine and brother Louise you know you got Wednesday night and go down the list here fellowship meeting brother home alone gore's which would be the third Saturday March the 20th through the 23rd sister June and I'll be gone we'll be in Oklahoma for a few days

brother Dale with one service so everybody got that and it will be posted just keep looking on the website and it will be posted and we'll be announcing it between now and then so Galatians 3:16 we're going to talk about journey of a believer and we're going to talk about Abram because yesterday we were listening to the youth and man they can ask some questions and still got some good ones for us too for brother Dale to answer some of them well then we'll have to touch on that later but but you hear what they say in you you think and you think man those mines they're so fresh and they're so new and they're there they're thinking about things and you know you may look over at your kid they're over there something's working somewhere even you know even my grandbaby Deanna you something will come up and she'll be way off in the other room and she'll go that's not right you know I mean you know she'll hear us say something you know about something in this alright and but they're listening I told you many times before I read a book long time ago and it's called wimp children are like wet cement whatever impression is made while they're while they're young and while it's wet that impression once it dries that impression stays there all through their life so we want to try to make a good impression here in the church where brother Dale talks about dedicating the children not only to the parents but also to hey we get them we get them Wednesdays and longtime Saturdays and and ever signed me pretty much so we're living before I'm almost as much as a regular family would so they they get to see us as much as they do the others and we want to make a good impression on the children so Galatians 3 verse 16 let's pray Heavenly Father thank you for this day that we have set time that we can come and talk about you Lord and listen to what the Bible's already said about a man named Abram that starts a journey that now even several thousand years from the time he physically walked the earth we're still talking about because God said that Abraham would be the faith seed that we're looking at in the end time the faith that Abraham had Lord we pray that it will ignite us today what's inside of us already and for the ones that are just coming in and the ones that are just listening now maybe for the first time that they'll listen Lord to what you've already said about a man and a journey that just took a natural journey through life but Lord it had so much spiritual implication till we're still talking about it today father we pray that you just healed the sick all the ones that are there sick in body Lord they're sick and soul we pray that you would just minister to each one father be with the ones that are not here the ones that are sick brother date brother Al all the different ones Lord that we call ever service we pray that you'd give them supernatural strength father we ask your blessings on the ones that are in the foreign fields we pray that you give them fruit for their labor father bless us today and give us our daily bread and Jesus name we pray amen so we're going to take our time let's see what Paul said in Galatians 3 verse 16 says now to Abraham and his seed where the promise is made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ now we got a listen now this is Paul we know there's a natural journey of a natural man but it has spiritual implication because the the true royal seed of Abraham was not Isaac it was Christ and then cry who at works Christ now crisis in us and then and there I say that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after him because we were talking about last night there was no law in Abraham's time there was no law the law was Moses four hundred and something years later God brings the law into existence on Mount Sinai with Moses Abraham doesn't have anything but but but what this man is fishing to say get up move all right for the inheritance wait a minute the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot dissin all that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more promise why because it's law it tells you what to do but God gave it to Abraham by promise let's read this one before you sit down Hebrews six verse 13 through 15 for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessings look at this I will bless them multiplying I will multiply Lee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing for the reading of the word and we look and we see this covenant that was made it was we've seen many times that brother Ram speaks of the Covenant but a covenant is made between two people and God in the beginning he made a covenant with late with Adam and he said Adam he said if as long as you don't eat of that tree you'll be fine you can eat of this one you can eat of all the fruit trees but of that one tree if you eat of that tree you're gonna die right so that's a conditional covenant that's a covenant with condition all right if you do this if you don't do that but now when God comes to Abraham God knows one thing for sure we can't keep the Covenant cuz that caused Adam his first son couldn't even keep the Covenant amen so what God says is he says okay I know you're gonna make mistakes I know you're going to be bad you're gonna have you know a carnal mind and I know you're gonna come the wrong way and I know all these things are gonna happen to you so I'm gonna make an unconditional covenant I'm gonna save you to spot yourself amen so that's what he said he could swear by no other he swore by himself he didn't swear by this or by that or by the don't eat the tree he said Abraham I promise you I'm going to make you a great man and many nations are gonna come out of you because watch now let's let's read this one quote and then you're gonna have to go brother Joe if he wanted to because we're gonna start in Genesis 12 if you got your Bibles I brought my new one because my other one this one brother just Trammell gave me an it's the Scofield and I really I haven't got all transcribed into it but my other Bible the book of Genesis the bow fell out of it so because you know me I like to book a Genesis so let's read this though and then let's start in Genesis 12 he's gonna try to bring it up on the screen so you can read it there but if you have your Bibles I'd rather you maybe look at your Bible because I want you to see it if they don't get it up here but now watch brother branham what he tells us and who is this Melchizedek in 1965 he says when Abraham met him he was Melchizedek he's talking about Jesus Christ in the form of Melchizedek not Jesus Christ the flesh man because remember Melchizedek was not your brother Melchizedek was not at that form he could not save Abraham he could give him the promise but he couldn't save him because at that point in time that was a body that was created he stepped into the body and then the body went out of existence that was not our brother okay but he was in a position though because watch this what brother Brahim says I love this quote because there's a promise to me and you when Abraham met him he was Melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes now what were you what are you you're an attribute of God amen so now he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final in every son of Abraham they you and I by faith seed we are the son of Abraham and daughters every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing what meet Melchizedek go on this journey of Abram that starts as Abram and then he ends up as Abraham and then he doesn't get circumcised at the first because that's the type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost he starts his journey so let's take a into Genesis 12 and let's remember now look this is a covenant that cannot be broken because God made it Abraham didn't say okay I'm gonna do this enough Abraham doesn't say anything God made the promise with Adam he said I Adam if you'll do this you'll be fine Adam broke that so guard sitting up not gonna do that anymore I'm gonna make a covenant with myself now if you make a covenant with yourself and your almighty eternal God it can't fail a man so this is what we're going to look at this cannot fail in Genesis 12 because I want you to see how this starts in the plan of redemption and we'll read your quotes maybe later on this afternoon where brother Brown tells you that this truly is the walk of justification sanctification and a baptism of the Holy Ghost in one man called Abram to begin with and then to Abraham all right so let's read this passage of Scripture now the Lord had said unto Abram now remember it's Abram it's not Abraham you and I young people old people doesn't matter when you started in your journey you become a newborn babe in Christ you have to start in abraham's place where something's going to tell you get up quit doing what you're doing get out of the wherever you're in you got to get up and move all right so there's justification so young people old people that are becoming young people I like that don't you older people I do because I'm an older people out but watch what God says now God's not gonna let Abram have anything to do with this except make a choice you remember yesterday young people we were talking about you a free moral agent to make any choice you can press play you can mash this you can mash that you can't blame it on nobody but yourself what you do but now watch now the Lord had said unto Abram he's talking to Abram you and I all start I want you to agree with me on this you all start as Abram you're not complete Abraham's name is now Abraham but that was the completion in the journey later he's Abram so all of you are Abram that are beginning in your Christian journey you're all in this position now the Lord had said unto Abram now look at that that's past tense so that doesn't mean that he just come down and spoke to Abram read your Bible now the Lord had said so in other words he's talking to Abram and I agree your brother Dale this is not a quote just a Freda you can't find this in the message in the hour she was asking about a quote last night I said he was mine I don't mind that but there's there's nothing in there that tells you that God didn't speak to a million other people when he spoke to Abram because God's not a respecter of persons he can't just section somebody off and say I'm gonna just deal with Abram and no one else but Abram is the only one that did what God said how many billions of people in the world were in the world alive when God called you yeah how many times have you said I've set an airport many times thousands of people walking by they don't have half them don't even know anything about God the other half believe in something they thinks of God the other part of them I don't know where they're at and they don't either but I said God why did you choose me you know what he told me he said because you responded because you responded because you see that makes an individual you responded when God called you said huh huh talking to me that's the same danger labrum he may have been talking to thousands of people that day and finally he comes Abram and Abram does what he says because watch what he says right here get thee out of thy country okay young people that are just born again do you go back do you go back to where you used to be why uh-huh good boy Jer what he said he's not in the same country he used to be we might be in the United States of America but but I promise you brothers that boy is not in the same country that he started in he's in a different place because God he said because he was born he's born again he knows that now because there's something happened he'd come out of right what is redemption coming out of and going into this maybe simple today but I want everybody to say be able to say Amen get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred your friends didn't come with you and this journey did they now you may have them now but I'm talking about your old friends all right then they're not here today why cuz you left their country from thy kindred and from thy father's house now don't leave your daddy's house that they take your type so far and in stop I'm tool you can if you find you late Neverland I'm tell and that I will show that you will be in a different country than buddy until a land that look now watch watch all this come into nothing Abraham's Abraham didn't him Abram didn't say anything watch watch this I unto a land that I will show thee now look Abram didn't go straight to that country now he went to Canaan he went to Egypt he went to this place he went to her and he went he just kept why because it's his journey though and you and I have the same way of trying to find the will of the Lord we do that and we made mistakes were Abram we're just walking in just God just calls us out and we responded but when he when you respond watch how God just takes it all over and does it itself I will make of thee a great nation not Abram you don't have to go scoop you do have to go to school you don't have to go in other words you don't have to learn what I'm fixing to tell you and I will bless thee and make thy name great Abram didn't have to do that God's gonna do it for it and thou shall be a blessing I've got my notes in my Bible I gotta get it out over here so we know I mean you're gonna you gonna be my example than anything because you were Abram but look at those I will now look at this and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless is there anybody else involved in this I will make of thee a great nation I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing now not Abram not Abram he's not going to make Abram a blessing but he's got to start somewhere to get to Abraham him because right now his name is means high father Abram but I've got telling him he's fixing to be he's going to make a great nation he's got to have some kind of change in his life to become Abraham the father of nations but watch and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed that's a pretty good load but you know what Abram didn't have to do anything God did it that's what I'm telling you about when you're starting your Christian journey God has laid these blessings out for you to just grab hold of because you're a babe you're a baby and here's Abram just for a little background here's Abram in there he's in herb child days he's over in a heathen country and his brother Dale said this morning he was not he's thought he didn't come from jewelry or juice the line of Jews he's in Hebrew because he came he came out of what you and I came out of what whatever we were in you can put that in there you came out of that to get into this place that God can talk to you Abram now that's not your full name yet but it is a start so here's Abram building idols with his father idol worship her and all of a sudden there somebody comes to him and says I need you to leave everything you got everything you got you got to leave whatever situation you're in you got to leave because we remember what does repent mean repent means to turn and go in the other direction God did not want Abram to continue to build idols he doesn't want you and I to continue to build idols he wanted him to get out of that country but remember he made a mistake because God didn't call what God called Abram so Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him that was the problem you know why because listen when you're justified you do bring some of the world in that journey with you amen I did you did you bring part of that with you but God doesn't tell you to do that you're doing out of your own and you will get in trouble for that because somewhere you gotta separate from that lot a lot separate from a lot right right okay everybody got that one more time a lot okay and a lot went with him and Abram was 75 years old young man when he departed out of Haran and Abram took Sarah I know that Sarah that's not Sarah right that woman and in here I see where I wrote in here is contentious Sarah huh huh aren't we a little contentious even when you come out cuz she brought a lot with you and you still married to part of the world which is contentious because remember you're not born again now this is the journey of Abram he's not entitle a broom and Abraham never got born again but he believed what God said cuz that makes us the faith seed of Abraham and as I read you before nuts now look Abraham Abram Abraham was told you'll produce so many children you can't count them look down at the sand look up at the sky now that's a promise God naturally gave Abram because you got to remember there's two things Abram is the walking a purely natural life but he's also walking so you and I can look back in the spiritual life that he's living and see that God was with him all during the journey everybody got that say man and Abram took Sarai the contentious one and lot his brother's son he's bringing baggage with him and gets you in trouble and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that had gotten in Haran now look he's taking a lot of baggage with him God didn't tell him to do that God said you you separate yourself that's the same thing in our journey listen and we do when we are justified in our justified journey we want everybody to be safe so we try to get our drunk friends and our smoking dope friends and whatever whatever friends we try to get them to come along with us because we're gonna go somewhere different you're gonna find out real quick that God didn't talk to all them God just talked to you you'll find out real quick that they ain't seeing what you're seeing hey man right they ain't saying what you're seeing but you're warm I come on I got this new thing man come on the church and come on I'm gonna start reading my Bible and y'all come on oh no they not know God didn't speak to them now if God spoke to them they're right there with you but you'll find out real quick that God only speaks to people that will listen remember I don't remember the I love this quote from Dwight Moody he said God will fill those who are not full of theirself yeah God will only I think the quote is God will only fill those who are not fool ourselves cuz if you're fooling yourself God ain't got I ain't got it all around but Abram started this journey now we may just get the justification today but we got two services next Sunday we can deal with that but Abram took Sarah Abram took Sarah his wife and large brother than anyway they stole here they go they got all this baggage they're heading into there what were they were they going they went to go into the land of Canaan if Canaan is the Promised Land for the believer right and into the land of Canaan they came to watch and Abram passed through the lens of the place of Sikkim unto the plain of mora and the Canaanites was then in the land and the Lord appeared unto Abram now look the Lord didn't appear unto everybody he appeared to Abram not your friends he appeared to Abram you put your name in there all right and the Lord appeared in Abram he said well I've never had the Lord appear to me he appears to you all the time because when you look down the word in the world and you see that he appears because what is he he's the word hey man just a veil it is so nice to hear you in this in this service god bless you and the Lord appeared I even Scofield picks this up and then you're in your margin it says theophany I'm well King I'm just reading what's that and the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto thy son do thy seed will I give this land now where's he at he's in Canaan but now watch he built an altar he went to church hello he went to church built an altar but now remember he's not gonna stay there because he's still Abram he's not Abraham he still got all this baggage and all these things that he's got with him and there builded an altar to the Lord who appeared unto Him now watch now go back down to the seven because he's in Canaan listen to me he's in Canaan right he's going to leave and go into other places but eventually he's going to come right back to where he met God you will come back to where you met God the first time if you're a true born-again believer even in your birth you're going to come by to that altar the first place that God appeared to you you're going to come back to that that's why this is April's journey is just thank God for a prophet because he could just think you just walk the journey with him and tell us all these things and I'm not bringing quotes you ought to know it by now what brother Branham said about Abraham and Abel and he removed from this until mountain is east of Bethel now Bethel that's Bethlehem it becomes Bethlehem which is the house of God's bread or the house of God all right now watch and he removed from thence into a mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent having Bethel on the west and high on the east and they builded an altar he's going to church you know it does not work it's not written that Abram ever built an altar because remember he had a bunch of other gods but when one guy when he met one guy he makes an altar everywhere he goes he built an altar unto the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord and Abram journeyed now look folks Abram got up and left why he didn't do what God said because Abram journeyed going on still toward the south and we read this last week about the famine there was a famine in the land now remember what I told you what is a famine a famine makes you make a decision you got to move when there's a famine in the land you got to leave but now God look Abram is still Abram not Abraham Abraham would have stayed there but Abram hightails it back to the world if you're not born again even in your justified condition if you keep going and keep going and if you lose sight you going right back indeed you're going right back to the things you used to do member brother Brown said justification is a work of the Holy Ghost but it's not an inward dwelling it's just getting your past sins chopped off you still have that old root of evil Abram was still Abram still had a contentious wife still had a lot to deal with okay forget someone just saying there's a lot to deal with free to get it okay but he had a lot to deal with he deals with a lot for a long time there was a famine in the land and Abram went down into Egypt which he should have never done brother Brom tells us that was his one mistake at one of his first mistakes because what happened soon as he gets down there he starts line hello soon as he gets in Egypt he goes right up he gets back he doesn't get in the world do you understand what I'm saying but in type he's heading back to the world now he's having to lie to keep his skin so he's got his contentious wife and he says you tell them that we're sisters not to save her to save him we get a little selfish when we're justified that's that but now remember what does a new birth bring will look at later and came to pass when you come near to enter into Egypt that he said unto Sarah his wife behold now I know that there are a fair woman to look upon I've lived with you for all these years memory 75 therefore it shall come to pass when the Egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife and they'll kill me but they'll save you say I praise thee thou art my sister would you just lie with me for a few minutes okay just lie with me come on let's let's get together on this that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee and remember let's skip through the story we know what happened but look at verse 17 going down to 17 remember what happened was Pharaoh did take her she must've been a pretty girl at 65 years old she must have been kind of a I'm pretty because Pharaoh said she's mine and Abram says you can have her really I mean he just but now look the Lord had to speak to Pharaoh verse 17 and the Lord plagued Pharaoh in his house with a great plague because of Sarah Abraham's wife and and Pharaoh called Abram now look brother Brahim tells us and I agree I don't think I have to agree with brother Branham but what he said brought how he brought it was he said see there he said God was preserving the promise there's no way Sarah womb was going to be polluted by any other man because naturally naturally the seed of Abraham that was promised is going to come through that woman Abram just don't know how it's done yet just like getting justification a lot of times we go god I don't know why how this is gonna end up but I'm just gonna trust what you said Abram is going through the same journey Sarah is just they're all wide-eyed she's like I'm just here but God protects both of them in their error listen folks listen young men young young ladies we make mistakes especially even in your first part of your journey because truly you do pull all the baggage with you because you don't know different Abram didn't know any different sir I didn't know any different now Abram just knew that somebody spoke to him and said get up and go somewhere else so he fumbles around just like we do in justification we fumble around but Pharaoh called Abram and said what is this that thou has done to me now look Abram is doing the line Sera's an accomplice but what does God say what is this that thou has done to me why did us now not tell me that she was thy wife why said it's - she is my sister so I might have taken her to me for a wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy way what's this and Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all that he had said him away she's my sister I mean they lied and God let them get by with it because he knew what part of the journey they were in it's just like we were talking about downstairs and yesterday afternoon in the Bible study listen folks Moses had a commission to bring the people out of Israel and put them in the promised land his commission was not to build an ark his commission was not to have to down across his commission was not to be in the first Church age of the third church age of the tip or the seventh Church age right that was his job this is Abraham's job you and I now have come to a place that this is our job we have a job to do and we'll get to it in just a minute is to be able to tell this story and walk right through it and today I want to ask you a question when we go through this and we may not get maybe even the sanctification but anyway I want you to say be able to say that happened to me you should have already said that if not then I drew you when you start on your little journey today if God is talking to you today I want you to get up now not get up out of church and leave but when you leave this building go to another country in God not another country but you understand what I mean because God is calling you I was reading heaven oh this book he gave me a long time ago back in 2007 I really had to open up much anybody ever read this what brother Brown was talking about here he's a little testimony about how God saved him you ought to read that that's real interesting and you know what he's a prophet but he's pretty simple about how God you know even a prophet God had to call him for years years years he called him he called him when he was 6 when he was about 10 when he was 14 years old and he got shot up and he was about ready to die he thought he was going to hell remember he thought he's dying that wasn't it either he kept going on read this little book but he said God's gonna call you for you last time he's long-suffering that's what I said about Abram he may have called Abram Abram was 75 when he left he may be like some of us a little slowly man starting when he was 20 but listen God knows if you'll answer or not so if God knows and he's made the promise the end between doesn't matter that's what we love about predestination how that God knows what you'll choose and knowing what you choose he can be long-suffering because you and I don't but we've got to make a choice to get up because the Lord plagued Pharaoh because of Sarah Abraham Abraham's wife now look in chapter 13 let's start here again chapter 13 and Abram went up out of Egypt so Abram now Abram gets a revelation and he gets ready to move okay I got that okay a neighbor went up out of Egypt he and his wife and all that he had he took a lot with him and Abram was very rich somewhere in there God's blessed him Abram was very rich in cattle and silver and in gold he wasn't a dummy I'm telling you folks God don't call I'm not belittling I'm not coming human ignorant sin human not knowing things spiritually minded people God loves to deal with even when you were doing what you were doing God still knew what that man right there was gonna do therefore he kept dealing with him and kept dealing with him and kept dealer same way without he just kept dealing and kept dealing same way brother Branham started six years old he's a prophet and he's 14 years old and older before he gets born again he's up close to 18 years old I think because God keeps calling him hey listen he was six years old he was standing under a tree and he looks up and the trees swirling and he said this man's voices don't smoke don't drink her to follow your body I've got something waiting on you waiting for you in other words in your life try that out at 6 years old you 8 remember he said he wouldn't even go up on that tree no more memory we walked all the way around that tree cuz they thought that man was up in there but it was God talking to him but listen God knows look God knew Abraham's journey God knows your journey everyone was very rich in cattle of silver and gold and he went on his journeys from South even to Bethel which the house of God bred unto the place of where his tent had been at the beginning brings him right back he's going to bring you right back until the place where his tent had been at the beginning between Bethel and high to the place of the altar he takes you right back to where you started and if you look folks if you built an altar there you're the one that left God okay you left God went to each of them you went to this you give you a wife away and you lied but what did God do he brought you right back to that testimony of the rock pile that you had first he brought you right back to there and he brought Abraham right back to that place right to Bethel bath l which is going to be Bethlehem which is the house of God's bread where Jesus was born right that's why you look at Abram you look at our journey he was in the promised land the whole time he's didn't know it until the place of the altar which he had made that first now look what if Avery would have just went here and got into Canaan he saw us enough for me I don't have to do that and walked off now if God brought him right back to the same place he comes back to an empty spot but he knew that God he knew that he had put that pile of rocks he had made an altar I'm saying he made a promise to God now you didn't keep it but what did God do brought Rutan God brought him right back to the same place and said hey you you told me what you were gonna write here swear you were gonna change I brought you back to this place right here and I want you to do what you said to begin with I want you to change everybody got that say man until the place of the altar now watch watch what Abram did now how did Abram know the name of the Lord how did April know what his name was oh he knows them at the time is the guy that said I will I will do this I will do that I'm I will do this and I'll give you this and I'll give you that I believe Abram got a revelation I believe when you start in your justification journey what's the first thing you get a revelation of I need to be baptized not in a title that's not a name Abram got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now he didn't physically you listen to me didn't physically you know that but he called on something he found something out he got a revelation in that journey where he went all the way around God took him right back to the place that he promised him and Abram began to call on his name he got a revelation he needed to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I'm talking about Abram you cuz look water baptism don't save you does not make you Abraham you're still Abram thereby alright with that let me tell y'all something real quick brother joke Canada told me something a couple of months ago and I wished you'd all try it y'all go down at 12 o'clock and you go out at nine you eat bread you eat sugar you eat carbs and about two o'clock well actually about two about 3:10 those carbs turn into sugar and you don't fight it no more but you know what I've been doing brother Joe told me he said if you'll fast in between services I didn't need a thing in between services just drink some water and drink a little bit of sprite and I feel great even though I'm up here I still feel good stop eating between service restaurants will hate me for that but that's way it goes fight it fight that sugar demon but look everyone come to a place to where you started calling on the name of the Lord you see how his revelation is progressing I didn't have a clue that the guy was really that talked to me first said hey just get up and leave now he knows he's come back to a place of an altar that he'd made and God met him there and Abram called on the name of the Lord now look he says here's flight now here's light here's all that light which went with Abram had flocks and herds and tents and the land was not able to bear them now listen what land is he talking about sure he's talking about a natural land but what land is God talking about cuz right now you're having a fight there's God in there trying to get you on in your journey and there's a devil in there saying you don't need to go nowhere the land was not able to bear them so you're gonna have to lean one way or the other you're gonna have to take one or the other in your land and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together because remember we have to come through this walk into sanctification of what is sanctification cleaned and set aside for service a separation we're heading toward that now but now look because both of their substance was great so this could not dwell together there was a strike between the herdsmen of Abraham Abraham's cattle let me look there was a strife between the angels of God and the angels of the devil that's what that saying if you talk about your journey nothing some of us in here have cattle but some don't but he's talking about what the herdsman there was a strife between this new spirit that's trying to come on you am i okay with that and the one that you've yielded to all along lot and it was a strife between the two and there was people in the land that it's okay and Abel said unto lot let there be no strife I pray thee between me and thee you come to church you come to church and you bring the herdsmen of lot and you bring the herdsmen of Abram and right here is where you have your strife in this land right here it's just where your strife is is right here but now what's Abram said look I pray thee there's this going on between me and then between minding of my angels and your demons for their brethren it's not the whole land before they separate thyself just let go and let God let go of that land now look he gave him a choice and Locke chose Sodom Abram went the other direction that's our problem holder talking about yesterday so you know one can I not quit you know looking at this and look at that because you're yielding to the light you're leading into that lot demon I don't say lots of demon but you understand what I mean lot was always that sticker that that Abram should have got rid of a long time ago trust the same thing with me and you should get something we should have got rid of a long time ago cuz look what what he lifted up his eyes Oh April said is not the whole land before they separate thyself I pray thee from me resist the devil and he'll free flee from you that that's a real hard Scripture if thou won't take the left hand then I'll go right if you want to right I'll go left in other words I'm gonna make a decision that I don't want to deal with you anymore I don't wanna deal with you and your herdsmen anymore if you say you gonna go that way I'm going that way it's not the whole land before thee separate thyself I pray thee from me now we'll take the left I'll take the right now I've departed the right I'll take the left and Lotte lifted up his eyes and beheld all look the plains of Jordan now that's nice that it was well watered everywhere before before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah I believe that a lot would have had a revelation like Abram a band Abram you say rebel even Abram because lot chose that and Abram said go ahead you can have all that okay what do you say brother Wade well you know what it looks like hey brother Zack for example it looks like that when you want to separate that the devil gets all the good stuff hello the devil gets all the good stuff that's real green it's real exciting it's fun it's beautiful oh I'm gonna be in Jordan okay but look what he chose Sodom and Gomorrah the two most evil places on the face of the earth that's what the devil will always choose even as the Garden of the Lord always trying to get us all back to the garden to be like the land of Egypt then Locke chose him all the plains of Jordan and lot journeyed East and they separated themselves one from the other Abraham he got Kaman how that happened that's the Promised Land he even let the devil choose it and then that will choke he's always going to choose wrong the devil's always going to choose wrong if it's guarding the devil you know the Devils I was gonna choose wrong it may be pretty alive said it may be glamorous it may look good it may smell good it may act good but it's gonna be destroyed by fire and brimstone not too far from here and like journeys they separated so that in your journey with what your journey and justification your walk of your journey is you're walking in the land and you've got all this baggage behind you you've got a lot with you and all of a sudden you're gonna turn around and say look there's a real strife in this guy right here there's a division that needs to happen that's never happened before devil I took you with me even in justification brother Brett said the old root of evil still there that root of evil is the evil one he's on that journey with you listen he's not gonna leave you I like what brother Larry says brother Larry he'll shake my hand and say I'm leaving he said that's something the devil's not gonna ever do so Locke chose all the plains of Jordan and lot journeyed East and they separated so you got to come to a place listen if God's gonna take you into sanctification somewhere along the line you've got to separate from what you used to do if not he can't clean you and set you aside for service all right and Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan and a lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards Sodom but the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly see the party chose how about that and the Lord said unto Abram after that life if you'll notice God hadn't said much to him there for a little while you know why because God's gonna let you make the choice he's gonna let you make the choice you're gonna have to make a choice and when Abram made a choice and he went this way and lot went that way what's the first thing happened the Lord started talking to Abram again and the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where you are now look where it was locked what was in the east he just said a lot lot was in eath but now watch what he's gonna and he took that place and that's it but watch what does a real son and daughter of God get Abram look North look South look East and look left for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever for all the land which thou sayeth the I will give it into thy seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth and he's giving him a natural brother Branham calls this the land grant this is the land grant all right because there's three sons named son of son of God son of man son of David but brother Brown brings one more in there son of Abraham the heir to the Royal grant coach truly this seed of Abraham is going to live in that place which is here remember brother Brown said Abraham was looking for a city whose builder and maker was God he's right there under feet he just didn't have an updated revelation well you know we get updated revelation Abram got one he didn't know who in the world was talking to him at first but all of a sudden he started calling him by name he's tasted calling the name of the Lord and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise whoa through the land brother Branham says footprints means possession that's why you going over to the New Testament and you read the scripture where Paul says how beautiful are the feet of those who bring tight and glad tidings how beautiful we're gonna have foot washing in a little while how beautiful are the feet why because listen we get a land grant - it's this right here we get a city but he's telling Abram Abram walk wherever arise walk through the land in the length of it and the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee then a bro removed his tent now remember he keeps moving and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre which is in Hebron Hebron Meade's seat of Association and II went to church in Hebron it's important to go to church if Abram everywhere he went made an altar and made a sacrifice to God it is a sacrifice to come to church and as of right now it's really a sacrifice for some of y'all to stay awake don't eat between sir and Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre which is in Hebron and built there an altar until the Lord everybody got that same in possession now watch let's go to chapter 14 we're just gonna get the justification we'll stop now pick up the other two next Sunday alright let's go to chapter 14 now look we'll just cover a few this and then we'll then we'll have communion foot washing and you came to pass in the days of whatever king it was and over King those word and whatever king those were that least made war with bera king of Sodom and burst camp Gomorrah now who was inside who was in Sodom and Gomorrah lot was all right now listen you got watch your type here and be careful so we'll look at it real quick all these were joined together in the Vale of Sodom which is the salt sea all right 12 years they served these people and they rebelled and in the fourteenth year came whatever that guy's name is and the kings that were with him in other words what they do they went down and they go to verse 12 they took lot Abrams brothers son who dwelt in Sodom and his Goods and they departed and there came one that escaped and told Abram the Hebrew free dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite now watch here's the grace of God lot go your way whatever it is you name your life today go home and name your lot okay because for some of us it is a lot but remember though Lots though the grace of God because remember you got to revert to the natural story of why Abram got lot out is because 8 because lot was a type of the what he was kind of the in-between believer brother Brent said the denominational guy that still is going to make it the Bible said that the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous soul brother Brent said is to see other righteous so he just didn't have the same revelation that Abraham had all right so let's revert back now to the natural part because when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house 304 sudents and and he divided himself against in other words he went down there and he helped out a brother because remember when you separate from these people and what goes down into wherever he's going sometimes that's your friends if I got that sometimes that's your friends that go that way and you see them get in trouble what's the first thing you do those that you trying to go save them you try to help them that's what Abram did to help his brother and he brought back all the goods now look let me tell you what happened here real quick in verse 17 now he brings everything back he don't ask nothing to nobody he don't want he don't want it like to give him anything he brought back all the goods he brought he restored him back everybody and the king of Sodom went out to meet him out to return from the slaughter of that king and that king in that King which was in the Kings Dale and look what happened because of Abraham's because of Abraham's belief in Abram seeing that God had led him somewhere God shows up even in his justification God shows up now who's Melchizedek brother I'm told tells us that Melchizedek is and I read you the quote and who's this milk is it brother branham said every son of the faith will take this journey in the final end time we'll take the same journey Abram took to Abraham because truly folks we're still in justification but to go to that next step of sanctification you got to meet God in a different way than you made him back then because if you don't go forward to know more about God you know what justification is to me it's a proving ground it's a proving ground you think about that in your journey it's a proving ground because God's going to try you the devil is definitely gonna turn all his guns on you because he's lost he hey when he lost me he lost his best guy I was number one soldier man so were you right and he want to lose you so he went after you but look what happens right before now we're getting we're gonna get we're gonna stop right here it's just 3:30 chapter 15 begins to walk of sanctification for Abram look who he meets right before he transitions into that next journey part of his journey Melchizedek comes to him and gives him brother man said and offers him communion now that's natural communion and we're fixing to take natural communion but remember when we take natural communion are you thinking about bread and wine I hope you're not I hope you're thinking about the close communion that you're going to have that God said if you'll do this to like um this is communion we're communing with God now it's not the bread and the wine that's going to be turned into the body and blood of the Lord he said this is a symbol and symbolic today we're going to take the bread and wine take communion as a symbol that we've met God hello we met God if you haven't met God you don't need to thank him Union the Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine he was the priest of the Most High God and He blessed him and he said look now wait a minute this is God pronouncing a blessing on Abram and he blessed him and said blessed be Abram of the Most High God my look he's getting closer listen God knows if your child to God or not and he thinks just as much of you in your little justification part as he does in your walk of fifty years because he knows you're gonna make it and he blessed him and said blessed be Abram of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth remember when you first started in your journey real quick I did for six months after I come right here give my heart to God I went back in six months later walking in justification for that time I would ask God something and he would just absolutely bring it to me some of you why are you baby you had to be nurtured blessed be Abram blessed be extra the West restarting in their journey let's be whoever put you in the bless to be that part that's we said blessed be Abram possessor of what he's done given to you he's going through telling him I've already promised you this and now I'm showing up and you're probably you think it's the worst time of your life your friends don't want to have nothing to do with you and I'm gonna bless you possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the Most High God was that delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him ties of all I don't need to explain that one hey Utah now look keep going we'll finish right here and the king of Sodom said unto Abram give me the persons and take the goods and Avram said to the king of sodom i have lifted up my head in other words i didn't do this for you i did this for the lord what you do now in your Christian journey you don't do for you you don't do for the devil you do for the Lord and Abram said of the King I've lifted up my hand unto the Lord the Most High God the possessor of heaven and earth that I will not take from a thread even to shoot you listen I'm in a journey I don't need all this baggage I don't need this I'm blessed blessed be Abram you know what he was saying sorry King I know you're a king but you can't give me what God can give me you can't give me one guy and April said to the king I've lifted up my hand to the Lord the Most High God then I will not take the thread or shoelace I will not take anything that's that's done lest I should have say I have made Abram rich save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with him those people let them take their portion when you get into your journey your Abram and even in justification he had a pretty good run but he did make mistakes he did bring a lot with him but even in bringing all that with him God still in his journey God is in all right Abram you're blessed you're blessed listen for God to just call your name you're blessed for God to just call you into this journey you are a blessed person most of the nine billion people on this earth will never get that blessing never get a possession never get eternal life never get to come back and live on this land right here because you gave him this land first once you give him this land he says okay you're a son of Abraham I gave Abraham the land so if you're a son of Abraham you're there and you get what Abraham and we even got out of Abram yet but you're gonna get I want to read them I want to read two quotes and then we'll let's stand to our feet you want to do them okay and we'll get ready to take communion if you want to I know we'll we're just going to let the communion service be the healing service anybody's got a physical need or a spiritual need while we're taking communion we've seen people physically healed from taking communion so that's gonna be our altar call yes y'all come on up here and get ready for the community let me read these two quotes Abraham's grace covenant 1961 if you want to pull those up brothers thinking how they said no wait what's he doing he's shown to Abraham this what he's going to do to Abraham's seed now what was he on the road after Abram after that he'd been justified sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost in types and shadows because remember Abraham never received the baptism the Holy Ghost because it couldn't but he did typify all that we just now did not read you the first few chapters of Abram and there was your justification and you say that's right that happened to me that's right that happened to me that's right that happened to me if you can say that then you've truly went through justification if you had a Niger you to ask God today to start taking you through that journey and have been placed in he came he was given a sign at the end that the end was at hand he came down and destroyed Sodom but I want you to see that let's go to the next quote number three real quick this is Abraham's grace covenant 1961 same same one he's doing the same thing to the seed of Abraham let's go down here now we're all seed of Abraham right we're all seed of Abraham we're not seed of Abram we're seeing a Baberaham right and they don't recognize it brethren see what I mean justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost placing of the son see we got to continue to get into that because you keep going on up even when when Abram comes Abraham comes to name chains and body chains and circumcision or circumcision in the body he goes on up to the air being obedient to God with Isaac and doing all these things God dwelling in his church human flesh eating drinking like man the holy spirit God Himself dwelling in the sons of Abraham manifesting the same thing that Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom chokes you up being the coming of the Son of Man that's where brother Berman gets that quote where he says that every son of the faith will take a final journey because Bible says as in the days of Sodom so shall be in the coming of the Son of Man and so we're in that coming of the Son of Man and man we're way into our journey but maybe we should revisit that and maybe you should go home today and read those first few chapters again and see what happened to Abram because if it don't type in a way how you came through your justification you didn't get it you can't come any other way because some of you were Amen cuz you know that's part of what you went through that connected with your journey some of you did not because if it's strange to you if it's strange to read the Bible and not see you in there and what God's doing during in your life you you definitely need a new birth and that's not a bad thing but at this late hour you better not dilly-dally around-- make your calling and election sure let's read the scripture and go into the community first Corinthians 11 verse 23 for I've received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you and this is Paul talking that's the same night that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when you're given thanks he break in and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me do you do that do you remember that night he's getting ready to die he's getting ready to give his life for you he's getting ready to have a they don't break his bones but his body is broke up fleshly cuts and all that just for me in you for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself Melchizedek came to Abram he must have examined itself he came to a place in this journey to where God was to both meet abram and feed him bread and wine okay I hope you're at that place now but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body you remember when we were reading that you don't you don't see that Locke got any of that lot just got saved by his by his brother-in-law he didn't get to take communion it's not registered that he's why because this Abram is the one that God is dealing with all right not lot but let a man examine himself show him lady me to that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body but this cause many are weak and sickly among you many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest all I said in order when I come let's take just a few moments of silent prayer reflection praying thanking God for what he has done for you and brother BAM told us one time he said while you're doing that he said pray for your pastor so takes time pray for your pastor and also pray that God will supernaturally bring something to you while you're taking this communion you
