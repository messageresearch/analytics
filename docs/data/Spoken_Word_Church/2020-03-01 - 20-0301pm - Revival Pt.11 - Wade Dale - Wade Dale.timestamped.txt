[2:01] I'd like to
[2:04] there were before I started on this I
[2:07] didn't grow up in a Christian home my
[2:12] parents didn't go to church and for a
[2:15] while they wouldn't let me go to church
[2:16] either but and I never heard of William
[2:20] Branham but when I was in high school I
[2:23] have a grandmother who had went to
[2:26] Pentecostal church and she would tell me
[2:29] things about the Lord and remember one
[2:34] day she's telling me about a Wednesday
[2:35] night prayer meeting they had and she
[2:38] said the fire department was called out
[2:40] somebody had seen fire on the church and
[2:44] she said the fire department got there
[2:46] the church was not on fire but there
[2:48] were little licks of blue flames got
[2:50] across the top because they were having
[2:52] a prayer meeting it it was things like
[2:58] that they're influenced me and I was
[3:01] probably that same age as some of these
[3:04] young brothers like Zac black Michael
[3:07] and when I the day that I I was thinking
[3:11] what brother way was preaching this
[3:13] morning I know the day that I knelt at
[3:16] the cross at the feet of Jesus and gave
[3:19] my heart to him there was a light came
[3:22] on inside and I didn't know it had been
[3:25] dark inside but from that from that day

[15:56] on we just all agree we can agree on I
[15:58] mean it's not a problem for us we just
[16:00] anyway let's go to Psalms 138 8
[16:05] decisions decisions Bible talks about
[16:10] the valley a value of decision let's
[16:13] just let's just hope thing get it done
[16:16] Lord to open up a place for them to have
[16:19] alright anything else any other
[16:21] announcements same thing I'm missing so
[16:24] I think night just remember officer
[16:26] brother Dale will be having a shoulder
[16:28] surgery on March the 10th if he gets
[16:30] over this cold he should be having this
[16:32] shoulder repaired so not replaced but
[16:36] repaired so just remember him he's been
[16:38] having some trouble with that so may the
[16:40] Lord bless him I hope you enjoyed this
[16:43] morning that was that was that was
[16:45] something that needed to fill in some
[16:47] gaps and then it will go a little bit
[16:48] further because listen you'd have to be
[16:53] just
[16:55] so narrow-minded like brother Brown said
[16:57] one time a man was so narrow-minded he
[16:59] could take a lead pencil put it between
[17:00] his eyes and they touched both eyeballs
[17:02] that's how narrow-minded some people are
[17:04] that this world is in a famine we got
[17:09] plenty of food plenty of water plenty of
[17:11] good stuff and still you see this
[17:14] coronavirus thing but but worse than
[17:16] that you see for the hearing of the word
[17:18] of God there is there it's narrowing
[17:21] down to a pencil point or a knife's
[17:23] blade edge of where you can hear the
[17:26] true Word of God and be fed by it and
[17:29] not only be fed by it but go on up the
[17:32] Statue of a perfect man and go on in God
[17:34] to the change of the body it will not
[17:38] happen without a word revival that's why
[17:41] we've been speaking on word revival it
[17:44] I mean healing is fine the the healing
[17:47] where Bibles and all these different
[17:48] reforms and all these different things
[17:50] they're good they have their time
[17:53] because they're in the body and you
[17:54] can't do without them but you and I as
[17:57] we said before as brother Branham told
[18:00] us yes this morning we're the final
[18:03] voice final means finality there is no
[18:05] other voice in this age but the bride of
[18:09] Jesus Christ and when we go over into
[18:12] another dimension that voice will
[18:15] continue in to take 144,000 out but it
[18:18] will be to no one in a Gentile age it
[18:21] will be in this age right here this
[18:22] other parts of the world
[18:24] there's no revival there's no there's
[18:26] nothing there's no God except to the
[18:30] 144,000 that are promised through two
[18:33] witnesses to culminate and put us in the
[18:36] Millennium Amen so let's focus in it's
[18:39] to you and you only the bride they can
[18:48] listen the umbrellas out there the
[18:50] healing and the signs and the miracles
[18:53] and the wonders God will do that whether
[18:55] you're saved or not a prostitute can
[18:58] pray to God and be healed but now that
[19:00] doesn't heal her soul if she gets a soul
[19:04] healing then she won't be a prostitute
[19:06] anymore okay I'm
[19:08] using that as a worst-case scenario but
[19:10] I'm telling you we we need to be careful
[19:13] that we don't take on that same spirit
[19:15] of adultery that's brother Branham
[19:20] remember he discerned that spirit of
[19:23] adultery on this man he wasn't
[19:25] committing physical adultery with his
[19:26] wife against his wife he was committing
[19:28] spiritual adultery from the Word of God
[19:32] so it's the same demon it's not it's not
[19:36] a it's not there's a real bad adulteress
[19:39] demon and then there's a kind of a nice
[19:41] adulteress demon no it's all the spirit
[19:44] of adultery brother Branham says you've
[19:45] taken a husband that's not yours that's
[19:48] committing adultery so if you take on a
[19:49] false doctrine that's taking on another
[19:51] another another bridegroom everybody got
[19:55] the upsell it's a solemn time but God
[19:58] promised we would make it we're going to
[20:01] make it someone will make it all right
[20:04] so Psalms 138 verse 8 let's go to the
[20:07] warden prayer the Lord Jesus thank you
[20:10] for this day that you give us that we
[20:11] can stand here Lord truly you know in my
[20:14] heart it's the purchase of your blood
[20:16] the greatest people to stand on the face
[20:18] of the earth that we can speak in front
[20:20] of them Lord today but father let it not
[20:22] be just a speech or words of a man but
[20:24] Lord let it come straight from your
[20:26] heart right to the people Lord that
[20:29] truly as the song says open the eyes of
[20:31] our heart open the eyes of the soul of
[20:34] our being that we can feed from your
[20:37] word Lord they did not be a natural food
[20:41] that we're looking for but a spiritual
[20:43] food that we're seeking Lord as we talk
[20:46] about water and rain and revival Lord
[20:49] what a refreshing time to have a good
[20:51] cold drink of really good clear water
[20:55] and Lord as we sit here today and we
[20:58] listen father may that clear crystal
[21:01] water come down from heaven and bathe
[21:04] each one of us Lord and give us a
[21:06] renewed spirit give us a renewed life as
[21:10] we you see many times people being
[21:12] caught in a desert and they're thirsting
[21:15] they're not calling for food they're
[21:16] calling for water just a little bit of
[21:18] water and how water nourishes
[21:21] Lord and how water brings us back up
[21:23] Lord and revives us father we pray that
[21:26] you'd do that to us today Lord we're
[21:28] needy people we need you more than
[21:30] anything father so I pray that you'd
[21:32] come on the scene father and you do the
[21:33] speaking you'd be the one that does a
[21:35] revealing father there any sick among us
[21:38] you said you sent your word and healed
[21:40] them and delivered them from destruction
[21:41] we pray that you just touch each one in
[21:43] this building the ones that are not in
[21:45] the building all the ones that are
[21:46] affiliated with this sanctuary with this
[21:47] people in the internet and different
[21:50] things brother Dale sitting home there
[21:51] father we pray that you just give him a
[21:53] supernatural charge that your blessing
[21:55] father and an anointing father for the
[21:57] work that he still has to do Lord just
[22:00] be with each one bless us take care of
[22:01] us keep us strong here father and give
[22:04] us this day our daily bread in Jesus
[22:06] name we pray amen
[22:07] Psalms 138 eight we're gonna kind of
[22:09] background a little bit and then we'll
[22:10] get into where we left off this morning
[22:13] though I walk in the midst of trouble
[22:16] that would revive me I want you to make
[22:19] sure that's you he's talking to you thou
[22:25] wilt revive class participation that
[22:29] would revive as brother John says I want
[22:32] that's not good do it again me thou wilt
[22:36] revive me thou shalt stretch forth thine
[22:40] hand against the wrath of mine enemies
[22:41] and thy right hand shall save me I've
[22:44] sorry I was thinking while I was done
[22:46] did you know it's somebody you got a
[22:48] bunch of excuse me you got a bunch of
[22:50] older people in a room and they're
[22:52] playing bingo and thinks they stalk but
[22:56] when that girl a woman hid that bingo
[22:59] card they take a body change and all the
[23:08] other people go here and they'd to go
[23:10] but no really that we should be we
[23:13] should be happy what God said about us
[23:17] and if it'll ever strike you like it
[23:19] would if you want a million dollars in a
[23:21] lottery or in a bingo game then you know
[23:24] watch and thou shalt stretch forth thine
[23:26] hand against the wrath of mine enemy and
[23:28] thy right hand shall save me the Lord
[23:31] will perfect that which concerning me
[23:33] thy mercy O Lord into
[23:35] forever for Satan off the works of thine
[23:38] own hand someday d5 one turn this oh god
[23:41] of our salvation caused on anger toward
[23:44] us decease wilt thou be angry with us
[23:46] forever this is David crying out to God
[23:49] look they'll be angry with us forever
[23:51] without draw out that anger to all
[23:53] generations he's asking a question but
[23:55] he says wilt thou not revive us again
[23:57] that thy people may rejoice indeed let's
[24:01] go ahead and rename us because that's
[24:02] what we're going to get to behold the
[24:04] day days come saith the Lord then I will
[24:08] send a famine in the land not a famine
[24:11] of bread nor thirst for water but of
[24:14] hearing the words of the Lord and they
[24:17] shall wander from sea to sea and from
[24:18] North even to the east they shall run to
[24:22] and fro to seek the word of the Lord and
[24:24] shall not find it in that day shall the
[24:27] fair virgins and young men faint for
[24:29] thirst you may be seated in the Lord at
[24:31] his blessing to the reading of the word
[24:33] now let's go ahead and read this I have
[24:36] another prayer that that brother Branham
[24:38] prayed I listen I don't I do not
[24:42] advocate that brother Branham was our
[24:44] intercessor but some of the prayers that
[24:47] he's praying I believe he was talking to
[24:49] me I believe he was talking he wasn't
[24:52] talking to them ever how many hundreds
[24:54] of sin to congregation that day back in
[24:56] 1964 he's talking to me because this is
[25:00] an updated revelation that I have that
[25:03] God's talking to me through this man
[25:06] [Music]
[25:07] God's talking to me through this man the
[25:11] man's not God so we get that straight
[25:14] than ever the picture is just so
[25:15] beautiful all right until there's only
[25:18] one intercessor between God and man and
[25:21] that's the man Christ Jesus and then
[25:23] then Paul says follow me as I follow
[25:26] Christ so let's read this one here we're
[25:29] brother branham's praying God created me
[25:31] a revival let me be the revival let each
[25:36] one of us be the revival the revival in
[25:38] me make me Lord to hunger make me to
[25:41] thirst create in me Lord that what is
[25:45] needed in me let me from this hour on be
[25:48] more consecrated servant a better
[25:51] servant more blessed of you more able
[25:54] more Humber more kinder more willing to
[25:56] work more looking to the things that are
[25:59] positive and forgetting the things that
[26:00] are in the past and the negatives let me
[26:03] press toward the mark of the high
[26:04] calling of Christ amen
[26:08] so that to me is a mouthful that is what
[26:11] I am trying to get to you that God is
[26:14] talking to you and telling you that we
[26:16] we and don't don't get me wrong when I
[26:19] say we don't need these other revivals
[26:21] but we've already come through these
[26:23] other revivals a healing revival and
[26:26] restoration and the different things
[26:28] that's not for me and you though our
[26:30] revival is a word revival that will
[26:33] change our bodies that will bring a
[26:36] resurrection and a rapture that's what
[26:40] we're looking at because obviously it
[26:42] hasn't happened in the other six
[26:43] churches sure they're sitting in
[26:48] heavenly places they have the baptism of
[26:50] the Holy Ghost
[26:51] but they didn't have a word revival to
[26:53] bring that thing to a culmination or to
[26:57] the headstone the only time the
[26:59] headstone is supposed to come is now and
[27:03] to me that is the word revival now
[27:06] there's there's partial word all down
[27:08] through here they had to they had they
[27:11] had they Paul had the pure unadulterated
[27:14] word but it wasn't all open because the
[27:17] book was still closed where is the book
[27:21] open in the days of the voice of the
[27:23] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[27:25] sound at the end of his message not the
[27:28] beginning at the end of his message he's
[27:31] going to sound an alarm or a trumpet
[27:33] we're gonna maybe if we get to it this
[27:36] afternoon we're gonna read we're brother
[27:38] I'm talks in the rapture book about a
[27:39] shout a voice and then a trumpet all
[27:43] right so we've been talking about the
[27:45] voice the voice of many waters the voice
[27:49] crying out there's the voice of one
[27:51] there's always a voice in every age
[27:53] Luther Wesley penticoff all the
[27:55] different ones but they've never they've
[27:57] never had the voice open under the open
[28:01] book
[28:01] which is the opening of the seven seals
[28:04] look Paul had nothing at all didn't know
[28:06] anything about the seals he died before
[28:07] the seals were even given to John to
[28:10] write in the Book of Revelations that
[28:13] there would be a seventh seal open and
[28:14] no one spoke of it until you see a
[28:17] prophet prophet coming in the end time
[28:19] and he starts telling us about
[28:21] he doesn't say word revival but it is a
[28:25] word revival it's the word being revived
[28:28] it's not being changed
[28:29] remember they wanted him to write a new
[28:32] book a new chapter a new Bible and he
[28:34] said no that ain't gonna work this Bible
[28:36] right here can't be changed that's why I
[28:40] said if you don't see every major
[28:43] doctrine come out of this Bible you've
[28:46] got a problem you've got another God
[28:50] Amen just like Daniel seventy weeks and
[28:52] all the different things you can't
[28:53] change the Bible the Bible is right
[28:57] everything else is wrong but when you
[29:01] have a word revival where is it coming
[29:02] from the Bible this is the only word
[29:08] there is there is no other book that we
[29:12] need to turn to and because the Prophet
[29:16] came in the end time and God threw that
[29:19] prophet pull those sails back
[29:21] listen start throwing Tomatoes you can
[29:26] throw some oranges too less vitamin C
[29:30] amen but anyway the Seventh Seal is what
[29:35] and for brother Branham
[29:41] because the seven seals is the full plan
[29:44] of redemption and he had to go off the
[29:46] scene he's in the ground waiting on
[29:49] somebody to become what he said hey man
[29:52] waiting on somebody to become us being
[29:56] then the final voice in Malachi 4 Luke
[29:59] 17 30 revelations 10 7 in the days of
[30:02] the voice of the seventh angel well
[30:04] remember that's not anything exclude
[30:07] we're not exclusive
[30:08] because in the days of the voice of the
[30:11] first angel there was a word sounded
[30:16] Paul didn't finish anything brought a
[30:20] message the people caught the message
[30:22] and they carried it on and then their
[30:25] revival began to what why did their
[30:28] revival why does a revival die down now
[30:32] listen you can say well they get tired
[30:35] of it how you gonna get tired of the
[30:36] Word of God Satan starts bringing in
[30:41] logs he starts putting logs different
[30:44] ideas and different sayings and
[30:46] different this and different that he
[30:48] starts bringing these things in and it
[30:51] clogs up God's program so God just says
[30:53] hey I can do something about that I'm
[30:57] gonna bring an Iranian and he's going to
[30:59] bring a message and that's gonna revive
[31:01] the people same water no different water
[31:05] now same way with brother Branham he
[31:07] didn't bring a different water he
[31:10] brought us a way to get those logs out
[31:12] and by that time there were so many logs
[31:15] in the water that Jesus was on the
[31:19] outside of the church trying to get back
[31:21] in that didn't put him all totally out
[31:22] of the church not in any other age
[31:26] brother Brown said was he put completely
[31:29] out of the church except this age right
[31:31] here and we read that this morning about
[31:34] spewing them out of the mouth but this
[31:38] revival that we're in will it will from
[31:41] this day forward I'm talking about today
[31:43] 2020 March the 1st it cannot and will
[31:47] not wane it cannot and will not go down
[31:50] oh you say well everything looks bad you
[31:53] know the old saying is
[31:55] people look around say well boys are
[31:58] brides in bad shape never has been never
[32:01] will be the true bride you're looking at
[32:05] the mixed multitude you're looking at
[32:07] even even the honda parts and then
[32:11] there's somebody Joshua Neelam there's
[32:15] somebody made it to the promised land
[32:17] because God promised that's why it's
[32:20] called a promised land somebody made it
[32:24] to the promised land if it wasn't it
[32:28] would just be land but it's so promised
[32:31] land and you're what's our promised land
[32:33] about gives my Holy Ghost through the
[32:35] church ages but now I promised land now
[32:38] it's not just getting the baptism of the
[32:41] Holy Ghost it's going up this statue of
[32:44] a perfect man knocking those logs out of
[32:46] your ditches so that what brother Ram
[32:48] said so the Holy Spirit that's why he
[32:50] put it right here that's not a different
[32:51] Holy Ghost and you got down here it's
[32:54] the same Holy Ghost but what's it doing
[32:55] its sealing all this together
[32:59] so that it can come to a place to where
[33:02] that can be what filled in and the caps
[33:06] don't come or the heads don't come and
[33:08] change our body and then mm-hmm
[33:11] I know that's that's about 10 summer
[33:15] sermons worth right there but still it
[33:19] all has to do with a revival it all has
[33:22] to do with the way we look at the Word
[33:23] of God we need to look at the Word of
[33:26] God more now more rich more pure because
[33:29] if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[33:31] you're gonna make it can't not make it
[33:36] there goes another promise acts to
[33:41] repent every one even be baptized in the
[33:44] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[33:45] of sin for you shall shall receive the
[33:49] gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise
[33:52] is T that's the promised land that's why
[33:56] it's brother Dale has been preaching on
[33:58] Paul Paul was back and says day without
[34:00] us cannot be made perfect there was
[34:02] nothing to perfect those people in the
[34:04] Old Testament they didn't have the Holy
[34:07] Ghost in their soul
[34:09] had an anointing that would cover them
[34:11] until Christ died but now you and I
[34:13] don't have that excuse now we know the
[34:17] blood covers us we know about the token
[34:19] but I'm telling you something folks I
[34:20] was reading a quote back here just a few
[34:22] minutes ago
[34:22] brother Brown said God said God didn't
[34:25] come just to just just to cover you over
[34:28] God didn't give you the Holy Ghost in
[34:30] the end time just to cover you over and
[34:32] hide you know he came to eradicate your
[34:35] sin he came to put it in a sea of god's
[34:38] forgetfulness never to be remembered
[34:40] again because you and i are you know the
[34:43] scripture tells us here we go off again
[34:46] the scripture tells us that he's coming
[34:49] back for a bride without spot or wrinkle
[34:54] now those that have went on they had
[34:57] spots and wrinkles while they were here
[35:00] sorry they were they were caught in
[35:02] these Church ages couldn't get all the
[35:04] way out properly God told us but you and
[35:06] I have the ability now by the Word of
[35:08] God by the open book by the word revival
[35:11] that you and I are going to be brother
[35:13] Brown says the sinless perfect bride of
[35:17] Jesus Christ what by the opening of the
[35:20] word same thing they had same Holy Ghost
[35:25] but they never went on and continued to
[35:28] have enough word to take them to where
[35:30] they can stand one day and say I and my
[35:33] father are one I am the resurrection and
[35:37] the life
[35:38] we'll get to that maybe in just a just a
[35:40] little while so we know that number two
[35:43] let's read real quick this revival is
[35:45] just the stirring on what you already
[35:46] know about we already read that several
[35:50] several hundred times now number three
[35:53] testimony on the seat then we begin to
[35:55] find out miracles didn't taking place in
[35:57] the more like they were the sick go home
[35:59] sick it isn't because of God it's
[36:02] because of the lack of the revival among
[36:04] the people now remember it's not going
[36:06] to be a worldwide revival
[36:10] right it'll be an individual revival it
[36:14] will not be as it was before we'll take
[36:18] a tent and go put it out in a community
[36:20] all that's over with sure they can do
[36:23] that that's fine but the bride
[36:25] the bride's revival is a word revival
[36:28] and it will completely like I said this
[36:31] morning I'm telling you we still have
[36:35] problems with the word everybody do this
[36:39] we still have problems with the word
[36:41] because we're still here
[36:42] but Jesus never had a problem with what
[36:45] the father told him and if he says that
[36:49] we're to be 1 John 17 weird to be one as
[36:52] he in the father 1 then there can't be
[36:55] an argument that's what we get the logs
[36:58] once we get to the River of Life folks
[37:00] when we get to that new city there's
[37:03] nothing to hold that River back all sins
[37:08] gone all worries gone all our own ideas
[37:11] are gone it's just a free-flowing River
[37:14] but that listen it's got a free flow in
[37:17] your soul and in your person so that we
[37:20] can't get out of here
[37:21] anybody got that say man that's what
[37:24] word and you say well I don't know if I
[37:26] get what you mean you don't know you can
[37:29] do it
[37:29] you've been equipped for the job we're
[37:33] astronauts brother Brown says we're
[37:37] prophetic people love revelation but the
[37:43] problem is is we think we got our own
[37:47] right Bob we think we got it not Bob but
[37:50] we you know you talk about other people
[37:51] they have these little different
[37:52] doctrines and yeah it's not your own
[37:54] idea it's got to be the Word of God not
[37:59] our own ideas
[38:02] brother Bram said it's because the lack
[38:04] of the revival among the people
[38:05] there's no revival they sit and listen
[38:07] and go home well I guess that was pretty
[38:09] good there's not that zeal there's not
[38:11] that something in the people that should
[38:14] be there I wrote myself a note there's
[38:17] got to be a pull which we sing I feel
[38:23] the pull I mean really come on honestly
[38:25] people every service do you fill a poll
[38:27] or you're just here to see the neighbor
[38:28] are you just here to exchange recipes or
[38:36] anything just protects while to see your
[38:37] boyfriend our girlfriend which is okay
[38:43] it's a good time to meet them here not
[38:44] somewhere else not advocating meeting
[38:46] them somewhere else but you feel the
[38:48] pull that you need more words that you
[38:51] need more word I need some more God you
[38:54] got yeah I'm giving you some son that's
[38:56] fine daddy but I want some more I want
[38:59] some more I got a log here and then when
[39:01] I get this log out of the way right that
[39:07] feels better when the waters flowing
[39:09] free man I hate for my toileting to back
[39:15] up I don't anybody ever has that problem
[39:18] Louis what are you smiling about
[39:20] Oh him anyway will not go there but I
[39:26] mean don't you hate that day I just
[39:28] messed your whole world up when there
[39:32] must be a secret going on back there by
[39:34] something but don't you just hate it
[39:36] though when you have your you know you
[39:38] go and you wash your hands and and you
[39:40] do all these things you go to the
[39:42] bathroom and eat your flesh the toilet
[39:44] are you are you doing your dishes and
[39:46] you pull the stop router you're flipping
[39:48] you go water is running everywhere why
[39:53] because your flus have been stopped up
[39:55] there some things topped up your your
[39:58] plumbing
[39:59] and it's not nice that's the same way
[40:01] with God we want this thing to flow
[40:05] that's why that that now and I
[40:07] appreciate I really do when brother Joe
[40:10] and some of them took over for the song
[40:13] service not belittling any other song
[40:15] leader at all I promise you is just the
[40:17] way things happen they come back here
[40:20] and you'll see them come in our office
[40:21] we're not in there talking about
[40:22] yesterday's news or today's football
[40:25] score right what are we doing brother
[40:29] John we're praying that God will anoint
[40:33] him to do his job first brother Joe
[40:36] brother boy and all the different ones
[40:38] that he'll anoint them to do their job
[40:40] and also their praying that God will
[40:42] anoint us to do our job now if we would
[40:45] do that more often
[40:46] we might get somewhere because prayer
[40:50] changes things but you know what that's
[40:55] the flow of the service that's what I
[40:58] enjoy I enjoy the flow of a service I
[41:00] don't like confusion there and God
[41:02] doesn't like confusion what brother
[41:03] Brian said God is not the author of what
[41:05] confusion all right so let's not if
[41:08] there's any type of confusion that's why
[41:10] I said this morning fits the in type of
[41:11] confusion we need to get together and
[41:12] talk about it
[41:13] because we want this thing to flow we
[41:15] want God to have preeminence we want the
[41:17] we want all the logs to be gone because
[41:19] that's Deadwood we want all that
[41:21] Deadwood to be gone before we walk
[41:22] through that door amen yeah somebody
[41:28] said the other day they come to this
[41:32] brethren from another church not here
[41:35] and told the brothers in I'm just really
[41:38] nice that's you and your wife stopped at
[41:40] the door back there and and gathered
[41:42] together and pray before you come in
[41:43] service so we really think that's great
[41:46] and the brother said well to be really
[41:49] honestly it says we're what we're doing
[41:51] is is praying and asking forgiveness for
[41:53] all that stuff we told said to each
[41:54] other before we got here coming to terms
[42:01] raise your hand well I'm gonna raise
[42:02] both of mine
[42:03] okay Boyd's got both his up well that
[42:07] could ruin a service if you don't get it
[42:08] out
[42:10] it could stop back there Bray you can
[42:17] start your argument that's the service
[42:19] again Julie you can start afterwards no
[42:22] boom listen we're just human but I'm
[42:28] telling you what though if you take this
[42:30] word revival anything you need it's in
[42:33] there for any situation you know what
[42:36] it's not gonna stop you from arguing
[42:38] you're two different human beings and
[42:40] you got families children grandchildren
[42:48] but there is ways to get rid of it
[42:50] before you come in the sanctuary and be
[42:51] able to talk to God and God be able to
[42:53] talk to you so that's what we're talking
[42:55] about is we feel you know you should
[42:57] feel the pull that you don't walk
[42:58] through that door you should feel in
[43:01] your heart something's not right
[43:03] take care of it right there then come
[43:08] into the house of God because brother
[43:11] Brown said here say there is not that
[43:13] something in the people that should be
[43:15] there and I believe it's that extra
[43:18] little desire to do what God says Joel 2
[43:23] verse 23 let's get through this be glad
[43:26] you children of Zion now who's he
[43:27] talking about yes now I want you to see
[43:31] this because I picked up something else
[43:33] on this again I love the Word of God
[43:34] because if you you think you've gleaned
[43:36] everything you can glean off of it and
[43:38] all of a sudden God says you need to
[43:39] talk about that for just a minute so
[43:42] we've read this about six times so we're
[43:43] going to read it again for he hath given
[43:46] you the former rain moderately and he
[43:49] will cause to come down for you the rain
[43:50] the former rain and the latter rain in
[43:52] the first month what it takes rain to
[43:54] grow something you can't grow anything
[43:56] in dry ground it takes the moisture
[43:58] right and the force you'll be full of
[44:00] fat I mean wheat and the facts shall
[44:02] overflow with wine and oil now look I
[44:05] will restore there's another promise he
[44:08] is going to not leave this bride tree a
[44:11] stump so here's mine here's my extra
[44:15] revelation he's going to reverse the
[44:19] process
[44:23] if those four eat it down if those four
[44:28] eat it down there's got to be four that
[44:31] bring it back up the lion the ox of man
[44:35] and the Eagle the baptism of the Holy
[44:36] Ghost brother Branham says for death
[44:38] messengers eat the tree down and for
[44:41] life messengers bring it by so he's
[44:43] going to reverse the process if if the
[44:46] locust each one of them had something
[44:48] different meant what the locusts eat the
[44:50] leaves or something I can't remember all
[44:52] that it's not just for another sermon
[44:53] but the locusts did apart well God's got
[44:56] to bring something to restore that part
[44:57] by it to bring that tree back you got to
[44:59] reverse the process you know brother
[45:01] Brown said one time it's somebody saying
[45:03] well what do I do about these about
[45:04] these demons that I have them you know
[45:06] of all these different I'm stings you
[45:08] know he said what do you say do the vice
[45:13] of mercy that's a direct quote so do the
[45:18] opposite watch what God's doing he's let
[45:20] this thing eat it down but he said I
[45:22] will restore through the reverse process
[45:25] if this one eat the leaves I'm going to
[45:29] send somebody that brings back the
[45:31] leaves and the leaves was what the
[45:33] leaves was I believe the worship and all
[45:35] that stuff you you see now what brother
[45:38] Brown did brother Branham came to
[45:40] restore us back to the faith of the
[45:43] father's restore us back to this tree
[45:45] this restoration of the bride tree our
[45:49] this revival and it couldn't come by
[45:53] anything but the Word of God
[45:55] so to reverse anything you've got if you
[45:58] see Satan's eating down do the vice
[46:00] versa of it if Satan gives you something
[46:03] you know if the devil gave me a bad
[46:07] thought about Bob I just go up to him
[46:09] and Huggies neck and say God bless you I
[46:10] love you man
[46:11] I said if Satan gives me back okay blame
[46:17] it on him if Satan gives me a bad
[46:19] thought about brother Bob but same way
[46:21] with anything doing the vice versa go to
[46:26] the Word of God full of promises that
[46:28] will give you the reverse process if it
[46:30] had to be eat down it's got to be
[46:32] brought back
[46:34] and it's got to be brought back with
[46:37] rain it's got to be brought back with
[46:39] moisture it's got to be brought back
[46:40] putting it in the right ground number
[46:45] four
[46:47] don't let that bubbling brook you don't
[46:50] need filter or strain no pumping no
[46:52] jerking no nothing else it's just there
[46:55] bubbling up I don't have to depend on
[46:57] local rains to fill it up rains or
[46:59] revivals where that fountain there's at
[47:01] the fountain of life where the carcasses
[47:03] the Eagles will gather you don't have to
[47:05] pump up a revival you don't have to pump
[47:08] up nothing everybody got that same man
[47:11] you do not have to pump it up all right
[47:14] so let's go the next one real quick
[47:16] mm-hmm
[47:18] it's what we read this morning
[47:20] revelations it had in his hair was white
[47:22] like wool white as snow his eyes were
[47:24] flames of fire and his feet like unto
[47:25] fine brass said their burning furnace
[47:27] and his voice as the sound of many
[47:30] waters brother Branham says and his
[47:34] voice go and read the read just a 4-time
[47:38] and his voice was the voice of many
[47:40] waters
[47:41] both Christ in the church speaking
[47:43] together in other words she saying what
[47:46] he said with no argument because she is
[47:52] him with a golden girdle around about
[47:58] the breast part of the church covered
[48:00] over holding the gospel holding the
[48:04] righteousness of Christ over the church
[48:06] I love that quote let's go to Patmos
[48:09] vision and get then we'll get to the
[48:10] Book of Amos he's talking about the hair
[48:14] highest planet he's reading what reread
[48:16] the sound voice of many waters voice of
[48:19] many waters what does waters represent
[48:21] if you want to mark it down revelation
[48:22] 17 15 the Bible says the water which
[48:25] down sauce is thickness and multitude in
[48:27] people in tongues all right voice what a
[48:30] horrible thing for a drifting soul on
[48:32] the sea of life
[48:33] no pilot to guiding loose floating with
[48:37] the tides to hear the roar of the great
[48:38] cataract at the falls what a horrible
[48:40] thing that would be to a soul drifting
[48:42] voice of many waters what is his voice
[48:45] is the judgment the voice of the
[48:48] Esther's through the Holy Spirit that's
[48:50] cried out to the people in every age
[48:51] standing there the voice of many waters
[48:53] cried out thickness and multitude the
[48:56] voice of the seven stars in his hand
[48:58] ain't it wonderful to know that we know
[49:00] every one of them's and by name ain't it
[49:04] wonderful people read this and they go
[49:07] seven stars seven this seven that they
[49:10] have no clue and I'm not saying that
[49:13] derogatory but is that they don't go say
[49:15] well I know the first ones Paul Iranians
[49:18] Martin Klump no but God sent us a little
[49:20] seventh grade education prophet and took
[49:22] him in the back side of the desert took
[49:24] him in Arizona took him all these
[49:25] different places and he placed every one
[49:28] of them exactly to the man of those
[49:32] seven stars now we have not just seven
[49:34] stars we have seven stars with names on
[49:37] them
[49:37] a man so thank you Lord for sending us a
[49:40] prophet and every church age preaching
[49:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism in
[49:45] Jesus name speaking in tongues the power
[49:47] of God resurrection of Christ the second
[49:49] coming divine judgment the voice of many
[49:51] waters come forth from this one that
[49:54] looked like the Son of Man what is in
[49:57] time where do we start I'm we're
[50:00] supposed to be the son of man the son of
[50:03] man is that listen the son of man was
[50:05] Jesus Christ standing on the earth right
[50:08] what is it in the end time Jesus Christ
[50:10] standing on the earth he just can't get
[50:12] here he's got to come to a bride amen
[50:16] now watch the voice of the ministers the
[50:21] final voice to the final age John 7
[50:24] verse 37 and the last day that great day
[50:27] of the feast remember Jesus was in
[50:28] church Jesus stood and cried saying if
[50:32] any man thirst let him come unto me and
[50:33] drink he didn't believe it on me as the
[50:36] scripture has said out of his belly
[50:37] shall flow rivers of living water what a
[50:40] promise and I like that song like sister
[50:44] Barbara was saying we were we were
[50:46] singing it today there's a river of life
[50:48] flowing out from me from me make the
[50:52] lame to walk in the blind to see open
[50:55] prison doors sent the captive free
[50:56] there's a river of life flowing out from
[50:59] me
[51:00] amen Amos 8 verse 11 now let's get into
[51:05] this what we were talking about this
[51:06] morning just for a few minutes we got a
[51:08] really good note coke story behold the
[51:12] days come saith the Lord that I will
[51:13] send a famine in the land now this is
[51:15] this is also a promise all right so we
[51:18] got a promise not a famine of bread nor
[51:21] thirst for water but of hearing the
[51:23] words of the Lord and they shall wander
[51:25] from sea to sea and from North even to
[51:27] the east they shall run to and fro to
[51:28] seek the word of the Lord and shall not
[51:31] find it in that day shall the fair
[51:33] virgins and young men faint for thirst
[51:36] alright let's go to the Hebrew lexicon
[51:37] what is a famine is hunger it's famine
[51:42] in a land or a nation and then
[51:44] figuratively
[51:45] it's a famine for the Word of God
[51:49] individuals lack of food now what is the
[51:53] Word of God the Word of God is food amen
[51:57] cart where the carcass is brother
[51:59] Branham said where the word is the
[52:00] Eagles will be gathered there and it's
[52:03] fresh food not old food all right so
[52:07] look now also listen this morning let's
[52:09] look at the four things that famine does
[52:11] number one and I like this because just
[52:15] leave that right there
[52:16] number one keep this in the back your
[52:18] mind number one a famine moves people
[52:20] people have to move because of a famine
[52:24] 99.9% of the time people don't stay in
[52:27] the land where there's famine because
[52:28] there's nothing there
[52:29] amen it moves people it moves them to
[52:33] make a decision oh I like that it moves
[52:37] them to make a decision you think it's
[52:40] the worst thing in the world it could be
[52:42] the best thing in the world to you and
[52:46] during a famine there's lack of water
[52:48] there's lack of moisture and there's
[52:52] definitely no growth or they would be
[52:53] something would grow and you would have
[52:56] something to eat and there would be no
[52:57] famine alright so famine moves people
[53:00] moves them to make a decision it's a
[53:03] lack of water or a lack of the word
[53:06] there's no growth development you can be
[53:09] stunted going upset your perfect man
[53:14] and also death is included in famine
[53:18] because wherever there is famine there's
[53:21] most the time death all right there by
[53:23] okay with that say ma'am don't get bored
[53:26] with me now Genesis 12 verse 10 and
[53:29] there was a famine in the land and Abram
[53:32] just sit still
[53:33] no no Abram went down into Egypt was so
[53:39] during sojourn now listen Abram left and
[53:44] you'll see brother branham I didn't
[53:45] bring the quotes to save time on this
[53:47] one but he says that Abram got out of
[53:50] the will of God he's actually talking
[53:52] about Israel in the church talking about
[53:54] Israel getting out of their homeland
[53:55] God's not going to bless Israel until
[53:57] they get back to their homeland and he's
[54:03] not going to bleed it and blessed Abram
[54:04] till Abram went back to Canaan but the
[54:07] famine drove him out but it was still
[54:10] part of Abraham's journey to get to
[54:12] Abraham if I got that same M it was
[54:17] still part of Abraham's journey to learn
[54:19] a lesson to not go to Egypt and what is
[54:24] Egypt type the world
[54:26] alright now let's look in Ruth 1 verse 1
[54:29] now it came to pass in the days when the
[54:30] judges ruled that there was a famine in
[54:32] the land and it actually caused a group
[54:34] of men to move and a certain man of
[54:37] Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the
[54:38] country of Moab he and his wife which
[54:41] was the husband and excuse me Naomi and
[54:45] his two sons which wound up marrying Oh
[54:48] Oh anyway artha thank you and Ruth so
[54:55] that was part of Ruth's journey but the
[54:56] famine had to move them to another place
[54:59] everybody got that so we set this up
[55:02] watch second samuel verse 21 chapter 21
[55:05] verse 1 and there was a famine in the
[55:07] days of David three years year after
[55:10] year and David inquired of the Lord the
[55:11] Lord said it was for Saul for his bloody
[55:14] house because he saluted to gibeonites
[55:16] because there was something he did wrong
[55:19] first King 17:1 and Elijah the Tishbite
[55:23] this is what we're gonna we're gonna
[55:25] hone in on this one here because
[55:27] it's Elijah that's the first coming of
[55:30] Elijah we've got the fourth coming of
[55:32] Elijah it's got two parallel something
[55:34] somewhere mm-hmm and Elijah the Tishbite
[55:38] who was of the inhabitants of Gilead
[55:40] said unto a have as the Lord of God Lord
[55:42] God of Israel liveth before whom I stand
[55:45] there shall not be do nor rain these
[55:48] years but according to my word let's
[55:52] read what he said in Jezebel religion
[55:54] number seven watch him take this all
[55:57] brother branham could tell a story my he
[56:00] could tell a story and you just feel
[56:01] like you were right there sitting right
[56:03] there watching the thing you know what
[56:05] because he was sitting there watching it
[56:06] unfold God had given him a vision of
[56:08] what what he was talking about now
[56:11] through that you can you and I can get a
[56:13] vision of what's going on so watch now
[56:15] it looked like that he was sent to take
[56:16] what little she had but it was vice
[56:19] versa when she was willing to give what
[56:23] she had in support of the word God
[56:26] fetter and if you're willing to give
[56:29] what spirit you do have what spirit that
[56:33] God's give you to support of the word
[56:36] then God will keep you alive hallelujah
[56:39] Oh glory to God do you see it Church
[56:42] don't think I'm beside myself I'm not
[56:44] but once you have what you have got
[56:48] listen to me what you have got what
[56:52] little you do believe in God what faith
[56:56] you have got place it on the word not or
[57:02] not no organization not an organization
[57:04] put it in God's Word he'll keep you
[57:08] alive she was ready then because she
[57:12] couldn't before because they wouldn't
[57:14] let her but now she's ready will she
[57:17] receive it God sent a prophet her way
[57:23] updated revelation 20/20 did God not
[57:27] sends you a prophet in your way amen
[57:30] will she receive His Word will she
[57:34] receive this prophet yes she did and he
[57:38] told her he said now what little why
[57:41] if you've got place it in here and bring
[57:44] it to me first in other words she had
[57:45] that one little cake left that was all
[57:48] the life there was and the Elijah said
[57:51] bring it to me she agreed what and what
[57:56] happened when the rest of the world was
[57:59] languishing and dying in hunger her and
[58:03] her children in her household all eat
[58:06] three good meals a day divine revelation
[58:10] on the word I hope you see it friend
[58:13] what went on and he stayed there until
[58:16] the famine was over living with those
[58:19] women won't live in lieu this woman this
[58:21] church that received him and believes
[58:24] his word and he kept her alive kept the
[58:27] church alive by the word of the Lord
[58:29] because he said thus saith the Lord have
[58:33] you accepted thus saith the Lord have
[58:36] you accepted though folks the only
[58:41] reason we're still alive not physically
[58:44] the only reason we're alive spiritually
[58:46] is because of that man right then
[58:49] brother Brian brought us a message to
[58:51] keep us alive until God came that's what
[58:54] he said he stayed with her now listen
[58:56] brother I'm physically not with us but
[58:58] his voice his message is his message is
[59:01] with us and will be with us until the
[59:03] consummation let me tell you how
[59:10] important a prophet is now we're going
[59:13] to talk about Joseph here for a minute
[59:14] and once you realize the timing of this
[59:17] revival and the timing of all these
[59:19] things because we haven't spoke on
[59:23] revival
[59:25] ever I don't know here but now we're
[59:28] talking about revival and there's things
[59:29] happen in this that's bringing this
[59:31] revival to pass even we see people see
[59:34] people brother-brother black here you
[59:36] know bring bringing coming back to the
[59:39] Lord and realizing that he needed to
[59:40] change his life and and realizing that
[59:43] that he had some logs pretty big ones
[59:48] but you know what doesn't matter they be
[59:51] a redwood forest full of logs God don't
[59:53] care he'll get rid of them for you if
[59:54] you let him but we come to this place
[59:58] and we're fixing to read about Joseph
[1:00:00] now remember we're gonna set the story
[1:00:02] here because Joseph Pharaoh has a dream
[1:00:06] right everybody got that I'm gonna set
[1:00:09] the stage Joseph is in Egypt actually he
[1:00:14] got put in prison but Pharaoh had a
[1:00:17] dream about seven good-looking whatever
[1:00:23] you wanna call it
[1:00:24] cows whatever you want to call them
[1:00:27] seven good ones and then you see seven
[1:00:29] bad ones the seven bad ones eight to
[1:00:32] seven good ones and then he has another
[1:00:34] dream about seven ears of corn real good
[1:00:37] pretty ears of corn and then seven
[1:00:39] skinny ears of corn and they in other
[1:00:42] words they either eat or you know they
[1:00:44] take over the seven good ones well
[1:00:47] nobody in Egypt could tell Pharaoh what
[1:00:49] was going on so God sent Joseph his
[1:00:57] reputation got out that he could tell an
[1:01:02] interpretation to a dream so Pharaoh
[1:01:07] brings him out of them out of jail
[1:01:09] brings him up to and Joseph said Oh said
[1:01:13] you're gonna have seven or seven years
[1:01:16] that kind of called them kind kima the
[1:01:18] seven cows and the seven bad ones that
[1:01:20] eat them up it's going to be that you're
[1:01:22] going to have seven years of good and
[1:01:27] seven years of famine same way with the
[1:01:31] ear corn told the same thing we're
[1:01:32] reading here in just a second but I want
[1:01:34] you to realize
[1:01:35] you say well that was important that was
[1:01:39] not near as important because who knew
[1:01:44] when the seven years started who knew
[1:01:51] Joseph was the only person that knew
[1:01:53] when those seven years of plenty started
[1:01:56] now there's for sure we know when the
[1:01:59] seven years of famine because you gets
[1:02:01] after the seven of good but it took a
[1:02:03] prophet in his time to come to a group
[1:02:09] of people and say the famine is going to
[1:02:13] be in seven years but we can the good
[1:02:15] year starts now
[1:02:17] you said what are you saying brother
[1:02:19] wait seven years we didn't know when
[1:02:24] they started and we didn't know when
[1:02:26] they ended but a prophet did listen to
[1:02:31] this Genesis 41 I'm when it's kind of a
[1:02:34] long reading but I'm start first twenty
[1:02:36] eight this is the thing which I've
[1:02:38] spoken unto Pharaoh what God is about to
[1:02:40] do he show us unto Pharaoh behold there
[1:02:44] comes seven years of great plenty
[1:02:46] throughout all the land of Egypt like I
[1:02:48] said before when were they already in it
[1:02:52] wasn't going to start the next year
[1:02:54] because they had to put up seven years
[1:02:56] they had to put up plenty to last for
[1:03:00] seven more years of the drought
[1:03:01] so it took a prophet to come into the
[1:03:03] land and tell us or tell them when it
[1:03:07] started and there shall arise after them
[1:03:12] seven years of famine and all the plenty
[1:03:14] shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt
[1:03:17] and the famine shall consume the land
[1:03:19] and the plenty look and the plenty shall
[1:03:24] not be known in the land by reason of
[1:03:26] that famine following for it shall be
[1:03:28] very Grievous you got to know when it
[1:03:32] started and for that the dream was
[1:03:35] doubled under Pharaoh twice it is
[1:03:37] because the thing is established by God
[1:03:39] and God will shortly bring it to pass
[1:03:41] now therefore that Pharaoh take out a
[1:03:43] man discreet and wise and sent him over
[1:03:45] the land of Egypt let Pharaoh do the
[1:03:48] and let him appoint officers over the
[1:03:50] land and take up the fifth part of the
[1:03:52] land of Egypt in the seven plenteous
[1:03:54] years and let them gather all the food
[1:03:57] of those good years that come and lay up
[1:03:59] corn under the hand of Pharaoh and let
[1:04:00] them keep food in the city and that food
[1:04:03] shall be for what we talked about for
[1:04:05] food Word of God
[1:04:06] okay the Word of God this has got a
[1:04:09] spiritual meaning behind it there by a
[1:04:11] grace a man and then let them gather all
[1:04:14] the food for those good years that come
[1:04:16] and lay up corn under the hand of
[1:04:18] Pharaoh and let them keep food in the
[1:04:20] cities and that food shall be forced or
[1:04:22] to the land against the seven years of
[1:04:24] famine which shall be in the land of
[1:04:26] Egypt that the land perish not through
[1:04:28] the famine and the thing was good in the
[1:04:30] eyes of Pharaoh in the eyes of all the
[1:04:32] servants and Pharaoh said unto his
[1:04:34] servants can we find such a one as this
[1:04:36] a man in whom the Spirit of God is now
[1:04:40] watch and Pharaoh said unto Joseph for
[1:04:42] as much as God has showed thee all this
[1:04:44] there is none so discreet and wise as
[1:04:47] thou art now watch what Pharaoh does
[1:04:50] right here thou shalt be over my house
[1:04:54] and according unto thy word not mine I'm
[1:05:00] Pharaoh
[1:05:00] I'm the king if I say die Dolph I say
[1:05:03] live live right but he has transferred
[1:05:07] power to Joseph and according unto thy
[1:05:12] word shall all my people be ruled only
[1:05:16] in the throne will I be greater than
[1:05:24] thou only in the throne there's only one
[1:05:28] god but he has transferred the power of
[1:05:32] the voice to a man that knows what he's
[1:05:35] talking about to save us in the land of
[1:05:38] even in the plenty to store up what a
[1:05:41] brother Brown say in the vision the
[1:05:43] angel said store up food and of court I
[1:05:49] love this according to thy word shall
[1:05:51] all my people be rude Joseph was the
[1:05:55] second most powerful person in all of
[1:05:58] that Kingdom
[1:06:00] only in the throne will I be greater
[1:06:03] than now we can't be greater than God
[1:06:07] but he told us that we could sit in his
[1:06:11] throne and the voice that we speak if
[1:06:19] it's the voice of God it will come to
[1:06:24] pass
[1:06:25] let's read number eight here angel of
[1:06:29] the Lord 1951 see people a long time ago
[1:06:33] you ought to have come to God and got
[1:06:34] yourself settled down here what brother
[1:06:38] I'm saying he knows when that seven
[1:06:41] years of plenty is and he knows when the
[1:06:43] seven years a famine is going to be see
[1:06:47] people a long time ago you oughta have
[1:06:48] come to God and got yourself settle down
[1:06:50] know where you're standing the Bible
[1:06:53] said in these days that there'd be a
[1:06:54] famine not for bread and alone but for
[1:06:58] the hearing of the word of God and men
[1:07:00] would go from east west north and south
[1:07:02] trying to find it and would fail
[1:07:04] you better get sealed into the kingdom
[1:07:06] of God by the Holy Ghost while you got a
[1:07:08] chance you talk about a confusing time
[1:07:13] it's here I'm not saying that's coming
[1:07:18] you talk about a confusing time it's the
[1:07:21] coming when the Bible said they'd be
[1:07:23] seeing so close well it would deceive
[1:07:25] the very elect if possible it's not
[1:07:27] coming folks the prophecy he spoke is
[1:07:31] right here today amen you believe that
[1:07:36] it would deceive the very legs be
[1:07:38] possible all right the curtain of time
[1:07:39] number nine will move forward here just
[1:07:41] today I was reading a little place in
[1:07:43] scripture Joel
[1:07:44] I mean Amos 8:11 where it said there
[1:07:46] will be a famine not for bread or for
[1:07:48] bread and water but for hearing of the
[1:07:49] Word of God people will go from sea to
[1:07:51] sea from east to west to and fro
[1:07:52] everywhere seeking the Word of God and
[1:07:55] failed to find it if that don't fit this
[1:07:57] nation at this time I don't know where
[1:07:59] it is that's 1955
[1:08:01] we don't need bread we got plenty of it
[1:08:04] we got plenty to eat plenty of clothes
[1:08:06] to wear nice home to live in and
[1:08:07] everything but there's a famine for the
[1:08:09] hearing of the word of God a man
[1:08:12] know what to believe you're all I'm just
[1:08:19] telling you what brother Brennan said
[1:08:20] you're all confused one says this one
[1:08:23] says that and one says this one says
[1:08:25] something else
[1:08:26] base your thoughts on thus saith the
[1:08:29] Lord God will confirm it
[1:08:32] this word revival will cause a
[1:08:36] confirmation to come to you to ease your
[1:08:40] mind where am I at what am I doing here

[1:08:50] next prayer won't you listen to this
[1:08:53] brother brown's praying united under one
[1:08:55] head 1958 and god if there ever was a
[1:08:58] land that needed healing it's the land
[1:09:00] that we live in and we pray that you
[1:09:02] will heal it by sending an old-fashioned
[1:09:04] revival that will cure it of its
[1:09:06] diseases its spiritual ailments hmm you
[1:09:15] might have thought something else no
[1:09:16] spiritual ailments thou has give us
[1:09:19] plenty of food good clothes but all we
[1:09:22] long to hear the word of the lord thou
[1:09:24] has said it in the word there will come
[1:09:26] a famine in these days and people would
[1:09:28] run from north to south and from coast
[1:09:30] to coast seeking to hear the word of God
[1:09:31] and would fail to find it listen to this
[1:09:33] Oh God anoint your ministers afresh Lord
[1:09:39] may we get out into the field with the
[1:09:41] word plant the real word if there's no
[1:09:44] word no seeds sowed there will be no
[1:09:47] harvest listen it doesn't matter how
[1:09:50] much it rains if the seeds not planted
[1:09:54] in the ground there's nothing going to
[1:09:56] come up brother Brax my brother I'm
[1:09:58] sitting on seed there's nothing too
[1:10:00] quick and there's no seed there there's
[1:10:02] no seed of life give us strength now
[1:10:04] while it is day that we might show the
[1:10:07] seed of life to the dying in perishing
[1:10:09] millions for asking in the name for his
[1:10:12] glory amen
[1:10:17] we come to a place that we have it we're
[1:10:21] brother branham opened the seals and
[1:10:23] this would be our last thought go to
[1:10:29] Matthew 24 verse 7 I know this is all
[1:10:32] familiar but still still has to do with
[1:10:34] famine because when brother Brown was
[1:10:36] talking and in bringing us the seven
[1:10:39] seals
[1:10:39] remember he refers back to Matthew 24
[1:10:42] where Jesus preached the seals and that
[1:10:43] was seal 1 through 6 everybody got that
[1:10:47] same am matthew 24:4 nations your rise
[1:10:54] against nation and Kingdom against
[1:10:56] Kingdom and there shall be famines now
[1:10:58] listen there's been families and
[1:10:59] pestilence and earthquake all down
[1:11:02] through time right natural but what
[1:11:08] about the spiritual families that we've
[1:11:09] all been through all these are the
[1:11:11] beginning of Sorrows then shall they
[1:11:13] deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[1:11:17] kill you and you shall be hated of all
[1:11:19] nations for my name's sake now this is
[1:11:21] the third seal and this is the fourth
[1:11:23] seal what fourth seal is a raptured seal
[1:11:26] go back to go back to where we've been
[1:11:29] in in the seals when that whole year so
[1:11:33] let's go back to revelation 6 verse 5
[1:11:35] when he had opened the third seal I
[1:11:37] heard the third beast say come and see
[1:11:39] and I'll be held in the law of black
[1:11:40] horse and he that said of them have a
[1:11:41] pair of balances in his hand and heard a
[1:11:43] voice in the midst of the four beasts
[1:11:45] say a measure of wheat now remember
[1:11:46] brother Branham said that wasn't the
[1:11:48] voice of one of the beasts that was
[1:11:52] Jesus Christ amen
[1:11:55] but I got that say men we've not been
[1:11:58] through this and I heard a voice in the
[1:12:01] midst of the four beasts say a measure
[1:12:02] of wheat for a penny and three measures
[1:12:03] of barley for a penny brother Branham
[1:12:06] talks about that being a famine because
[1:12:08] they start charging for the food and see
[1:12:10] they'll not hurt the oil in the wine and
[1:12:12] when they had opened the fourth seal I
[1:12:14] heard the voice of the fourth beast say
[1:12:15] come and see
[1:12:16] I look and behold a pale horse and his
[1:12:18] name that sat on him was death and hell
[1:12:20] followed with him and power was given
[1:12:21] unto them over the fourth part of the
[1:12:24] earth to kill with the sword and with
[1:12:27] hunger
[1:12:28] and with death that's this in time
[1:12:32] that's the time right now what is a
[1:12:34] famine you say well what's going to
[1:12:37] happen they're not killing us by the
[1:12:39] sword of natural they're killing us by
[1:12:42] false word amen and the hunger which is
[1:12:46] part of famine and with death which is
[1:12:48] hooked to famine because you and I in
[1:12:50] the end time know for a fact that Satan
[1:12:53] being that fourth horse rider which is
[1:12:55] the pale horse that that's the power of
[1:12:58] all four three horses put into one horse
[1:13:01] and man all of Satan's power the XOC a
[1:13:05] power that he has not Dunamis the
[1:13:07] exosphere power that he has he's trying
[1:13:10] to amass and he listened he didn't want
[1:13:13] you to die listen Satan is not a
[1:13:16] murderer you do the murdering for him
[1:13:22] Satan physically can't kill anybody
[1:13:25] how does he kill you stay at home don't
[1:13:29] listen the tapes
[1:13:30] talk about your neighbor talk about your
[1:13:32] brother run this one down run that one
[1:13:35] down too
[1:13:40] that's the killing because it's a
[1:13:44] killing of the inside man
[1:13:46] brother Brown said if you killed a man's
[1:13:48] influence you've killed the man listen
[1:13:52] we're not we're not in the end time of
[1:13:54] looking for now we know there's going to
[1:13:56] be a battle that's gonna happen when
[1:13:58] we're out of here this is gonna kill a
[1:13:59] lot of people physically but the very
[1:14:02] reason that you and I get out of here is
[1:14:04] because Satan has killed so many people
[1:14:06] spiritually until zonal there's only a
[1:14:09] few left and it has to be through a word
[1:14:12] revival that you and I Satan listen say
[1:14:16] it doesn't matter how many healings you
[1:14:17] get Satan doesn't matter it doesn't
[1:14:19] matter to the devil anything you do like
[1:14:23] we were talking about the other day
[1:14:25] Satan's God's right-hand man Satan was
[1:14:29] his worship angel so now they have
[1:14:34] worship centers and they worship hours
[1:14:36] and hours and hours of just worship and
[1:14:39] no preaching Satan enjoys that say it
[1:14:44] doesn't mind that at all that doesn't
[1:14:46] bother him at all what bothers him is
[1:14:49] when you come to church and get a
[1:14:55] revelation that God is talking to you
[1:14:58] and gives you a promise and you hold on
[1:15:01] to that promise and it quicking
[1:15:02] something inside to listen Jesus Christ
[1:15:05] walking into the desert he was he was so
[1:15:08] hungry 40 days first thing Satan sensing
[1:15:12] pouring to that big old rock over there
[1:15:14] I'd make a big piece of bread you could
[1:15:17] really eat that big old piece of bread
[1:15:19] you just turn it into a into a piece of
[1:15:21] bread and you can just eat it Jesus
[1:15:24] looked at him and he didn't you know you
[1:15:26] didn't he just look I'm sure he just
[1:15:30] turned to looked at him and said it's
[1:15:33] written you're not supposed to tempt the
[1:15:34] LORD thy God Saint said well what am i
[1:15:41] dealing with here then after you get to
[1:15:43] the 3rd when Satan's done knock back on
[1:15:45] his heels so far the Bible says he
[1:15:47] leaves in something he's never done to
[1:15:49] me
[1:15:51] I like what brother Larry skogen says
[1:15:55] he's I'm gonna do something the devil
[1:15:56] will never do he's I'm fixing to leave
[1:15:59] you but the power is in the Word of God
[1:16:05] and that power has to lay inside of you
[1:16:07] it has to be that you we come to
[1:16:11] adoption to where Pharaoh tells Joseph
[1:16:15] it's your word you can't be God Joseph
[1:16:20] but you can act in my stead I instill
[1:16:24] what I have into you and besides being a
[1:16:28] creator being the one that created you
[1:16:31] you've got every other power that you
[1:16:33] need and that came from the word of
[1:16:39] Pharaoh the word let's go to job five
[1:16:51] till five verse 17 because listen folks
[1:16:58] we're going to still be here
[1:16:59] and we're gonna still be dying still
[1:17:01] getting old if we don't do something but
[1:17:06] remember you can't do anything but pray
[1:17:09] it down you pray it down you pray read
[1:17:13] your Bible I know and I'm as human as
[1:17:17] you are you want to brother Dale when he
[1:17:19] gets to the very end of a powerful
[1:17:21] series he's been on and you're sitting
[1:17:23] there with your toes curled up in your
[1:17:24] shoes and you're sitting on the edge of
[1:17:26] your seat not asleep sitting on the edge
[1:17:29] of your seat and you want to say God
[1:17:31] he's gonna tell me some little something
[1:17:33] and I'm just gonna take a body change
[1:17:36] that's not the way it work sorry it's
[1:17:42] this great crescendo that we're coming
[1:17:44] to you know we're gonna we're gonna
[1:17:46] bring this thing to a to a powerful end
[1:17:49] and this whole building is gonna shake I
[1:17:51] wish remember a famine you can be in a
[1:18:00] famine but you can survive because a
[1:18:03] prophet told you you can survive that
[1:18:08] little woman listen God didn't come to
[1:18:11] her when the barrel was high full God
[1:18:14] didn't come to her when the barrel had
[1:18:15] about three or four days worth in it God
[1:18:18] came to that with a woman by a prophet
[1:18:20] of God the very day she was gonna die
[1:18:25] the very day she got to her last piece
[1:18:29] of meal and God sent a prophet now
[1:18:33] listen I'm gonna humanize this thing how
[1:18:39] many of you being the mother of a baby
[1:18:44] and you're down to your last meal so you
[1:18:47] know what you've done you've rationed
[1:18:49] for a long time before that listen they
[1:18:52] ain't been eating three meals a day
[1:18:53] before that and all of a sudden they
[1:18:54] just got one pick know she's been
[1:18:56] sectioning it out and maybe giving more
[1:18:59] to the baby and she's weak
[1:19:01] she's hungry herself she knows that this
[1:19:05] thing's coming down to a close and then
[1:19:07] a strange man walk up to your door and
[1:19:09] go bake me a cake women sisters what
[1:19:18] would you say to that man
[1:19:19] don't say that loud what would you say
[1:19:23] though bake me that cake you know she
[1:19:31] said she just told him one time she said
[1:19:33] this is my last meal me and my boys
[1:19:36] gonna eat this and we're gonna die
[1:19:38] it never fazed Elijah one bit Elijah did
[1:19:41] not compromise on why he was sent there
[1:19:46] Elijah did not compromise on why he was
[1:19:51] sent there
[1:19:52] he said bake me a cake he said but I'll
[1:19:56] promise you in other words dust at the
[1:19:59] Lord you do this little bit and you'll
[1:20:04] eat in plenty three square meals a day
[1:20:06] until this famine is over with what's
[1:20:10] God done to you and I he may have came
[1:20:13] down to the last time you need you had
[1:20:15] something and he said hey listen to what
[1:20:18] this guy's got to say listen to what
[1:20:21] this prophets got to say listen to what
[1:20:23] this fivefold ministry has got to say
[1:20:25] with the voice of the Prophet flowing
[1:20:27] through them is it important it saved
[1:20:32] her life and it saved her son's life so
[1:20:36] let's listen to this joke 5 verse 17
[1:20:37] behold happy is the man whom God correct
[1:20:41] this boy that's kind of controversial
[1:20:44] isn't it blessed isn't happy is a man
[1:20:49] who God correct us therefore despise not
[1:20:52] thou the chastening of the Almighty
[1:20:54] for he maketh sore and bind us up he
[1:20:58] wound it and his hands make whole he
[1:21:01] shall deliver thee in six troubles hmm
[1:21:05] yeah in the seventh there shall no evil
[1:21:10] touch thee what church are we in
[1:21:14] in seven there shall no evil touch thee
[1:21:18] in famine he shall redeem thee from
[1:21:22] death and in war from the power of the
[1:21:25] sword old folks we're gonna have battles
[1:21:28] but the war is already won thou shalt be
[1:21:32] hid from the scourge of the tongue
[1:21:34] neither shalt thou be afraid of
[1:21:36] destruction when it cometh at
[1:21:40] destruction and famine thou shalt laugh
[1:21:45] neither shalt thou be afraid of the
[1:21:48] beasts of the earth let's go to Psalms
[1:21:50] 33 18 behold the eye of the Lord is upon
[1:21:54] them that fear him upon them that hope
[1:21:56] in his mercy to deliver their soul from
[1:21:59] death and to keep them alive in famine
[1:22:05] giving you some promises here some 37 18
[1:22:08] the Lord knoweth the days of the upright
[1:22:10] and their inheritance shall be forever
[1:22:13] they shall not be ashamed in the evil
[1:22:16] time and in the days of flats famine
[1:22:19] they shall be satisfied that's what the
[1:22:24] Word of God said about you see that he's
[1:22:26] already put that provision in there he
[1:22:30] give you that provision the days of
[1:22:32] famine he said by the way you read us
[1:22:35] that scripture and Amos he looks kind of
[1:22:36] bad it does look bad but I remember one
[1:22:40] characteristics of a famine is as it
[1:22:42] moves you makes you make a decision
[1:22:46] every day you're at church you have to
[1:22:48] make a decision
[1:22:49] brother Brown says you either leave
[1:22:51] worse or better you have made a decision
[1:22:53] to keep that demon in you or you've made
[1:22:57] that decision to lay him down and walk
[1:22:59] out that door Oden you and a free person
[1:23:01] now listen one more quote and brother
[1:23:04] Anderson this is one I was going to use
[1:23:08] in the rapture message and this will
[1:23:11] bring it to a close
[1:23:12] remember Jesus told us he said my sheep
[1:23:15] know my voice my sheep know my voice the
[1:23:19] voice of the bridegroom and the voice of
[1:23:21] the bride are gonna be together in the
[1:23:22] endtime rapture message 1965 the first
[1:23:27] thing is the sounding the first thing is
[1:23:29] the trumpet or he stops he said a voice
[1:23:31] a shout then a voice then a trumpet
[1:23:34] shout a messenger getting the people
[1:23:37] ready hmm the second is the voice of the
[1:23:43] resurrection the same voice that allowed
[1:23:45] voice in Saint John that called Lazarus
[1:23:47] from the grave getting the bride
[1:23:49] together and then the resurrection of
[1:23:51] the Dead to be caught up with it now
[1:23:54] watch the three things take place the
[1:23:55] next is what was a trumpet a shout and a
[1:23:58] voice of trumpet now the third thing is
[1:24:00] a trumpet which always is the Feast of
[1:24:02] Trumpets calling the people to the feet
[1:24:03] and that'll be the bride's supper of the
[1:24:05] lamb supper with the bride in the sky so
[1:24:08] you better not be looking you better not
[1:24:10] be looking for that will already be
[1:24:14] changed and over on the other side when
[1:24:16] that happens the first thing comes forth
[1:24:19] is his message calling the bride
[1:24:21] together what the boys are a shout a
[1:24:25] shout to break what hey hey hey hey I
[1:24:30] wake a few of you up just when somebody
[1:24:34] shouts what's the first thing you do you
[1:24:37] turn to see what's going on you turn to
[1:24:41] see what's going on so my shout says hey
[1:24:42] what what's going on all right listen
[1:24:45] the first thing comes forth is this
[1:24:48] message calling the bride together the
[1:24:49] next thing is the resurrection of the
[1:24:51] sleeping bride the one's died back in
[1:24:53] the other ages they're caught together
[1:24:54] and the trumpet the feast in the heavens
[1:24:57] in the sky well that's the thing that
[1:24:58] takes place friends we're right there
[1:25:00] ready now the only thing look the church
[1:25:03] is coming out has got to lay before the
[1:25:05] Sun to ripen now what brings that listen
[1:25:10] that's what I want to bring this last
[1:25:11] point you've got a former in the latter
[1:25:13] rain the former rain is what the
[1:25:15] teaching rain are the rain that breaks
[1:25:17] the seed open and gets the thing to
[1:25:19] start growing is that all right say
[1:25:20] ma'am
[1:25:21] now remember here's a key the latter
[1:25:26] rain which is the harvest rain listen
[1:25:29] you don't harvest anything during a rain
[1:25:35] [Music]
[1:25:36] there's hard I don't know of anything
[1:25:38] what do you have to do you have to wait
[1:25:41] it dries it sure the harvest rain is
[1:25:44] going to come the let the latter rain is
[1:25:47] going to fall is falling now but it's
[1:25:49] not to harvest it's to get us ready for
[1:25:52] the harvest everybody got that same in
[1:25:54] one more time the corn is out there in
[1:25:57] the field you got you heart your former
[1:25:59] rain it brings the plan up which is the
[1:26:02] teaching rain to show you how to go up
[1:26:04] the Statue of a perfect man but you
[1:26:06] can't harvest that corn when it's wet it
[1:26:09] was sour on you anything that you
[1:26:11] harvest wet unless you want to make I'm
[1:26:14] sorry if you want to make beer or
[1:26:15] something with it cuz that's where it
[1:26:17] rottens but if you want true grain if
[1:26:19] you want true corn you wait until it
[1:26:22] dries it has to go through a famine it
[1:26:29] has to go through a famine but there's
[1:26:33] life in it there's life in it but that
[1:26:38] you say well what do you say brother
[1:26:39] wait well you can't say the harvest rain
[1:26:41] is what we're it's what we're looking
[1:26:43] for
[1:26:45] it's too late if you think the harvest
[1:26:49] rain is going to be when they harvest
[1:26:51] listen lay before the Sun to ripen and
[1:26:57] it's not raining though you've already
[1:26:58] had your rain right now we're having our
[1:27:00] ladder rain falling on us to give us a
[1:27:05] harvest but you got to lay in the Esso
[1:27:09] in to ripen the great combine will come
[1:27:13] by after a while the wheat will be burnt
[1:27:17] or the stalks but the grain will be
[1:27:19] gathered into its garner we Sam brother
[1:27:22] wait let's don't look for a harvest rain
[1:27:25] the harvest rains falling now and the
[1:27:28] harvest is going to be the resurrection
[1:27:31] not that they're not the same we're
[1:27:33] getting our rain now
[1:27:35] but we've got to go through a drying
[1:27:36] period we got to go through the famine
[1:27:41] but even as we go through a famine I
[1:27:43] want to ask you a question as the
[1:27:45] musicians come I want to ask you a
[1:27:47] question as it logic aim by your house
[1:27:51] as Elijah came by your house and
[1:27:55] promised you that your cruise and your
[1:27:58] barrel will not run dry that during the
[1:28:00] time of famine that he will absolutely
[1:28:03] sustain you give you strength for
[1:28:07] everybody else it's dying all around you
[1:28:12] but there's no harvest during the rain
[1:28:14] we're getting our rain now we're getting
[1:28:17] our revival now we're not looking for it
[1:28:20] I'm looking at it because if you don't
[1:28:23] if we keep pushing it this way in this
[1:28:25] way we're gonna be a bunch of wet grain
[1:28:27] and God's not going to harvest wet grain
[1:28:29] we're gonna have to go through a period
[1:28:31] but God's going to sustain us and keep
[1:28:34] us so whatever you you know that's why
[1:28:37] I've been trying to tell you this word
[1:28:39] revival brother Brown says it's not
[1:28:41] gonna be some whooping something or
[1:28:42] somewhere you work it up and you've got
[1:28:44] all the great signs and wonders I
[1:28:46] believe there I believe we can we have
[1:28:48] them but that's not my foundation of
[1:28:54] this revival it's not that I've got to
[1:28:57] see signs and wonders I thought signs
[1:29:00] and wonders followed after the believer
[1:29:02] and man I like what brother Danny
[1:29:04] steamin did that time he took two kids
[1:29:06] and he he put them behind him he's told
[1:29:08] this one's name a sign and this one name
[1:29:10] is wonders and he was the believer and
[1:29:13] he started walking down the aisle and he
[1:29:15] said signs and wonders follow the
[1:29:17] believer not in front of them a man saw
[1:29:20] them kids following him all over the
[1:29:22] place but that's a good point the
[1:29:26] greatest sign and Wonder is is that
[1:29:27] you'll make it to the end of this thing
[1:29:29] and you'll take a body change where
[1:29:31] nobody else has done it before let's
[1:29:34] stand our feet if you have a need today
[1:29:41] but you should be able to accept it
[1:29:44] right in your seat
[1:29:46] believe what God's already said about
[1:29:48] you if you don't get nothing else from
[1:29:51] today ask yourself a question as the
[1:29:55] Elijah came by and said thus saith the
[1:29:58] Lord your crews won't ever run dry don't
[1:30:02] worry about what's happening out in the
[1:30:04] world don't worry about it what it looks
[1:30:06] like out there
[1:30:07] I will sustain you I have given you thus
[1:30:11] at the Lord we live under the staff the
[1:30:15] Lord but he doesn't say it except he
[1:30:20] says it to his little bride first listen
[1:30:24] he tells us he tells us his secret not
[1:30:29] the world I want you to know one thing's
[1:30:32] for sure
[1:30:34] my brother Ernie says you're absolutely
[1:30:38] connected to something eternal and being
[1:30:42] connected with something eternal that
[1:30:44] makes you eternal with eternal thoughts
[1:30:47] and eternal qualities that you and I
