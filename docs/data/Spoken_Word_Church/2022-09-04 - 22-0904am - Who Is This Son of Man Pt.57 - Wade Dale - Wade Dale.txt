three of them down here so that's we appreciate that you can't have them no more they gotta stay down here all right let me read this quote real quick and then we will read the scripture and be seated from power transformation look what brother brown says now work we've been taught and we're going to get started on the virtues next week but we've got to stay on this foundation we've got to make sure we're born again we got to know we're going to see this afternoon where brother branham not only says it one time he says it four different times these virtues are required it's a requirement of god it's not something we might need to do or something we need to bypass it's something we got to go through all right so brother brown says sometimes you have to separate from everything that's dear on earth to you i'm gonna read your scripture a little while jesus said forsake mother father sister brother and follow me all right to take your position that god has called you to that's the word we're going to be using a lot when we start in from faith to virtue that is a position and that is a position in christ not a position in school or a position in the church all right that's a that's gifts of god position of of god and we need to get in our position brother ryan said well what realize who we are what we're doing here and get in our right place then what the rapture will take place we're we're kind of a a body that's a little bit out of joint maybe um that's a whole body but everybody needs to get in there we need to we need a god chiropractor to get us back in to get us back in line you know i'm sure you can read between the lines what i'm saying see sometimes the very dearest person on earth you have to shake hands with them now what he's saying is shake hands with them and walk away from them just take your position in christ to where god has called you amen well i'm worried now if brother if brother uh donny's in his position no you worry about yours let brother donny worry about his all right there's apostles prophets pastors teachers and the bankers to help him but let him you know let him get in his own position now look but what is god doing that's what we're going to talk about we've been talking about renewing of your mind transforming you from what you was maybe a daughter or a son or whatever it is from a lovely family sometimes he places you somewhere else god is a separator amen because it's his way of doing it see by the renewing of your mind to obey the word of god regardless of what the price is these things don't come now look our redemption wasn't a cheap thing it was the son of god had to die for us things of value come of great price that's by our heads lord thank you for this day that you give us we appreciate the time that we have here lord now i pray that you do sanctify us for this journey that we're on thank you for bringing us here lord thank you for a group of people that we can speak to lord i pray that you should move me out of the way lord and you take over and you do the speaking father you do the revealing lord if there be anybody sick among us lord i pray that you'd heal them lord and the ones that are on be on the highways that we've already called our names also josh and leah different ones that are out today we pray they should bring them back together this being a labor day weekend lord a long weekend people are taking off i pray that you'll just be with us now though just take care of the ones that are here lord that are faithful come to church today lord to hear from you father so i pray that you do that you would send us something to hear lord we pray in jesus name amen john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word where was the god and the word was god and the word was made flesh so there's a position the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory of only begotten of the father full of grace and truth let's read first that's the longest and then you can be seated that every one of you should know now when we're gonna when we get i was reading last night about knowledge brother brown spends a lot of time on knowledge in the statue of perfect man book he don't spend a lot of time on virtue but boy on knowledge he spends several pages because we mix our knowledge with man's knowledge our knowledge with god's knowledge a lot of times and that's where we get mixed up it was saying last night in the bible study if you see a preacher get up and he preaches false doctrine that is not god coming out of his mouth because god can't preach a false doctrine amen that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel and sanctification and honor you may be seated in the lord's blessing to the reading of the word romans 12 verse 2 says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that's what god's going to do he's going to absolutely drew me and you he's going to prove to the devil that somebody that was born in sin shaping in the nicu a spouse from a mother's womb a liar doomed and on our way to hell he's going to use you to get us out of here he's going to work through you to get us out of here all of us collectively as a body nobody's going without the other one we're not going to leave an arm here we're not going to leave a finger here but by the renewing of your mind it's got to start in your what stinking thinking amen that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god i was reading last night where brother brown was talking about somebody said well brother ryan we can't be perfect he said the bible tells us to be perfect he said if the bible tells us to be perfect he's got to make a way for us to be perfect he can't just throw it out there like me and you may throw out a plan and brother gary looks at it and goes i can't build that why because we throw some drastic plan out there but not with god god's plan is perfect it's already done in his mind it's already finished so in second peter one now this is going to be the first part we've got to get we've got to nail it down that you we're either born again or not today today sitting in here in front of me looking at me you're either born again or you're not that's right there's no in between now you may be working toward but until you get we were talking last night the holy fire of god which is going to in the battle of gog and magog is going to burn demons up souls he didn't burn your soul completely up he burnt that old nature that was attached to you because you were born with a carnal mind he burnt that off by holy fire and you're inside of you your soul is just as eternal as god is because it is god all right so now but we got to get that settled down first if we get that settled down first then we can move forward as we were saying and we'll talk about in just a few minutes that's where some hate the cross some come to the cross and they get a really good experience i'll read it here in just a little while brother bryan said you get a good case of sanctification now that won't get you in the in the bride in the end time that just cleans you up gets the unclean spirit out but you've got to put god back inside there what you got to get a divine nature your own nature is horrible that's right everybody in the building would you all do this your own nature is horrible even the one that you have to deal with now in the next realm which is memories of conscious effects and imagination you got to deal with that there's there's a lot of things going on there that you got to deal with that's where that's where this is going to work at yes amen your souls is eternal as god is and when brother branham will read it here in just a minute brother brown said when you get born again you get all you got all you need for your journey but now you got to remember then then that's a group of people that says well we don't need the statue of perfect man teaching because we already got it well where's the youngest baby in the in the place probably ellie well let's take ellie beautiful little girl she is and let's just go put her in her closet she's a human right she's a human let's go put her in the closet and don't feed her she'll die that's right that's the way it is with god you'll die if you don't get fed but you have everything you ever faculty in her to be a wife to be a mother is right there sitting in her now but she has not developed it yet same way with me and you because you and i are newborn what babies newborn babes in christ down here at the bottom of the pyramid babies crying wanting daddy all the time so watch what simon peter said look simon peter a servant apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained went out and got it like precious faith with us now that's peter talking that's peter that's one of the apostles that's one of the disciples of jesus that's one man that has these virtues because he's going to tell you to get them he's going to tell you you need them so if he tells you you need them he's already got them and god thought enough of him to put him in an eternal word of god so there's the eternal word of god telling us that you have to obtain a light precious faith that's why i'm spent for two months on trying to make it sure that we know either we're born again or we're not i want to make sure we either know one of the two all right and it's not just a feeling it's not just emotion it's not just well brother around with a prophet well i come to church i believe brother dale's uh my pastor and and we got all this down and everything that's good but are you born again because you know what they came up to paul and they and paul said they started talking to him you know cornelius or wherever the house he was and he was preaching he was a good guy and paul said have you ever received the holy ghost since you believed all that so i want to say to you today have you received the holy ghost since you well i've believed this for 50 years have you received the holy ghost since you believed in what you got amen that you have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his what divine power what we say power was dunamis dynamite dynamo power according as he has given as his divine power has what given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us the glory and virtue that's why i've been telling you folks if you don't go to church you ain't born again i'm sorry you can't go across the word of god i've been telling you all this and i've heard other preachers online and everybody is trying to get people to just to do the number one simple things brother brown said abc's then we'll get the xyz but we got to get the abcs first it ought to be your desire i read to you the other day it might it must be your desire you're yearning to be a church and i'll promise you about saturday evening about 10 or 11 o'clock something's going to happen that didn't happen all week and as i said before he got diarrhea lost your dog can't find the keys to the car i don't have any gas in my car so we can't go to church today garbage garbage it's just excuses and you know what you're gonna have to answer to god not me so don't don't think it's me you gotta answer to god cause he wrote it in his word he said and much more as the day approaches much more we need to try our best to do what we can do to live the word of god ain't not what a christian life is no bro wait it's just believing brother branham was the prophet no there's going to be hell's going to be full of people that believe brother brown was a prophet well i'll preach it anyway through the knowledge of him that has called us what called us to glory and virtue whereby are given to us what exceeding amen exceeding great and precious promises that by these what these promises and we're going to read this the way brother branham read it either this afternoon i may have in my notes we're going to let him read it and break it down because he says by what by these promises so are there promises of god amen all right it's not a promise peter may it's a promise god made if you'll live these virtues guess what something's going to happen that you may be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and that's where we've been right there for several months we've been on the foundation of faith and like i said before it looks like a cross almost and that's where we were talking about the other day about that that's the beam that we have to carry because listen it's not easy it's easy being a christian okay it should be but it's so contrary to the world it makes you think that you're that you're you know you're having ladies your sisters you're having to not cut your hair no if you'll get born again you'll know inside of you that's what the bible says not what william branham said it's been in the bible way before william branham got here going to church it's been way before william branham got here so the first stage we know is the birth we've been on that i want to make sure that we understand that we're not just justified that we're not just sanctified that we're not stuck in a rut that we've moved on with god that we want to know more of god isn't that the christian life it's wanting to know more of god i want more of you we sing all these songs more of you and the different things do we well i've got this not you'll have to talk to god about that so romans 8 verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god look they're led by the spirit of god they're the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage against fear you're not bound now the world thinks you're bound the world thinks we're bound to a cult or to a man or to a this or to a ladder we got to do this we got to do that like brother donny says he says they call us the skirt church they can't call us nothing else so they call us a skirt church because every time they see you wearing a skirt well thank god hey man what a testimony for as many as led by the spirit of god what they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear because when we go up this statue of perfect man it's not a fearful thing as far as being afraid you shouldn't be afraid to want virtue you shouldn't be afraid to want the knowledge of god you shouldn't be afraid of that well boy bro when we get up there brother kindness i don't know if i love my brothers i love myself well then you ain't gonna make it amen because he made provision for you to make it yes sir i was reading the scripture you know we're talking about beams we've been talking about beams you know the cross beam that goes on top of the cross and i went to the scripture where jesus said how can you that's got that little bitty you know you're talking about the little moat which is a little bitty small straw in your brother's eye and you can't get the beam out of your own eye all right remember when you point fingers how many you got pointing back at you you got three of them pointing back at you all right we have to say things as ministers i think this other day we have to say things as ministers because we're called of god to do that but we do it like brother dale's always done it with softness and and wisdom and we pray that we continue that we can do it that we can absolutely cut your head off and you not even know it for we are not surgical but you have received what the spirit of adoption so what is adoption adoption is placing so it's going up the statue of perfect land perfect man you're not adopted at your new birth yes you are but no you're not you're not at full adoption you've been adopted into the family but then you have a growth development or you have to go through a process this whole thing is a process amen for we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we what cry cause we're babies daddy i need this i've said many times before remember when you first got born again it was all just wonderful i mean you know uh roses and and you know you had the the lawrence welt with all the bubbles going up you know and all that stuff and some people the young people go who's lawrence well but all of us older ones remember the bubbles coming up you know it was just so nice yeah that happens at one time and then you ask god for something and he gives it to you now i'm going to read you a quote this afternoon where brother brown says even if god don't give it to you if you come up this statue of a perfect man to a certain place having patience he says have patience with god he said knowing that if you don't get it there's a reason you don't get it and god has that reason and it's your best remember i said the best nose you ever get from god is the best yes as you'll ever get if god says no you don't need to go there then don't go there but you know what you know what he's going to do he's going to stand out of the way and let you go on if you want to do it but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby you cry daddy daddy the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit what that we are the children of god children yes and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we what suffer with him amen that we may also be what glorified together he got a glorified body we were talking about that last night he got a glorified body so we're going to get a glorified body amen so now we looked at baby form justification as we saw on the map and sanctification that is in your soul that's god working inside your soul everybody with me on that where do you sin you sin in your soul you don't sin with your flesh your flesh is just a what it's just a vehicle to manifest what's inside of you all right so in your soul we're looking at justification where your sins where you do as we were talking about you come to the cross you say god forgive me of my sins i'm sorry you died for what you died for me so that we can get rid of those sins that's right but then we turn around though and go back the other way and start doing it again because that's justification we don't have the want to stay at the cross to completely die everybody all right with that all right sanctification's the same way we continue a little bit further what sanctification we were talking about last night brother brown said god did the world the same way does you under justification he took noah got noah god put him in an ark and god destroyed the whole world and baptized this earth all right then he came the next 2000 years jesus came himself to cleanse and claim it sanctify it when his blood dropped on the earth he claimed the earth where were you at the time of the crucifixion your body was in the earth all right your physical body and then we come to the baptism of the holy ghost is where we see that gog and magog is going to be a fire like we were talking about last night the battle of armageddon is man's fire the battle of gog and magog is god's fire we want god's fire to burn us out we don't want a man to stand up in the pulpit and tell us everything's okay that's right that's man's fire you might miss something but with god's fire he's not going to miss a thing he's going to boil you out tear you up separate you from the world separate you from your parents the great prince of peace stood one day and said i didn't come to bring peace that's the bible he said i've come to bring a sword to divide yes listen god's not a mingler jesus christ is not oh well we're all going to make it the baptists are good and the methodists are good and we just all over lump him in one lump now god didn't do that he said unless you what take up your cross we're going to see it just a minute your cr your cross not his and follow me you'll have no part with me unless you forsake father mother sister brother he told the guy one time he said a guy comes up and we think that was pretty good guy walks up and says well jesus i can't come to your in other words i can't come to your feast i've had a death in the family oh now if a preacher brother john if a priest or what if y'all like brother carl said i gotta go to the funeral today i said let the dead bury the dead you need to be in church now that's pretty awful right no it's not it's what he said that's what jesus said not what i said and it's not my interpretation read it in the bible he said let the dead bear the dead come and follow me we've become too wishy-washy that surgical knife will cut you completely if you'll let it sit the surgical knife of the word of god the sword the word of god will cut you and divide what you don't need and what you do need and when we go up the statue of perfect man it might be more like a chainsaw or a serrated edge knife but you know what it's going to help us i want us to be the most powerful church on the face of the earth not just building not just lula georgia but the bride is going to have to be the final voice of the final age she's going to have to be the one that manifests god that when we need something we don't have to call three four people we ask god for it ourselves and you know what he'll back it up all we gotta do is say what that ain't nothing but the truth everything you've listened to for 50 years you got to believe it and live it and say that ain't nothing but the truth and then what's god do what he said he would do amen so now look in sanctification he said it give you a new spirit now that spirit isn't god's spirit that's your spirit what's he do he cleans your spirit up all right unclean spirit goes out of your soul can't be two can't be god and the devil in your soul at the same time but there is a time when there's nobody in there unclean spirit goes out walks in dry places seek his threat finest none comes back into his house finds it swept and garnished alcohol's gone cigarette's gone this is gone so i said you cannot there is no way you can base your new birth on quitting these things of the world you can quit drinking and not be you may still be the most ranked center in the world the drink is most smoking cussing running around and all the things we did before bc before christ that should go out of sanctification that's the unclean spirit that goes out but what's going to happen is if you don't get it filled up with god's spirit he's going to satan's going to move in with his religious buddies and they're going to come in put you in a church that's right well if you get to go that's your spirit god gives you a new spirit then he says i'll put my spirit that's what i want i want the spirit of god inside of me i don't even want the spirit of god anointing me not yet i want him in me first and then he anoint me all he wants to amen i want him inside the holy of holies but the thing god has to do is what give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settled down or he couldn't even live with you under the baptism the holy ghost look seeing that you have purified your souls in obeying what the truth through the spirit under what unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth in the body forever now how are we going to do that paul tells us he said in hebrews 6 verse 1 he said therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ what is what was the first doctrine of jesus christ brother brown tells us you must be born again he looks at nicodemus and you must be born again that's his first major doctrine kingdom of heaven is the hand which is the new birth but he tells nicodemus you must be born again all right so therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on into perfection not laying again the foundation look once we lay this foundation of this building why would we want to lay another one on top of it why would we want to lay an extension of one oh yeah we like to extend our house and make it a little bit bigger but we talk about god's house god's house is perfect when he begins and it will stay perfect till the end let us go on into perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god please we don't need to waste our time keep asking god for forgiveness for the same thing listen if you're still doing the same thing over and over you need to get born again because under justification that what that chops off your past sin that puts it in the sea of god's forgetfulness you need to put a no fishing sign up do not let anybody go there even yourself throw the fishing pole away because you know what when god put it there he can't remember it that ought to make you happy god can't even remember it who can lay anything a charge to god's elect it's god that what justified about bit my tongue off that'd be disastrous wouldn't it for some of you it would be a blessing of the doctrine of baptism a laying on of hands and resurrection of the dead of eternal joy what basic doctrine and this look and this will we do if god permits then we talked about the tabernacle just for a minute we know that there's three uh uh i wish we could have brought in yesterday's or the bible study from yesterday because that's why the whole thing we talked about that's why that's why i love the future home the future home book gives you the whole plan of redemption from your body all the way to the earth and the new city coming down from heaven so that to me that's the greatest book and he keep he preaches three positions or three stages of grace justification saints kitchen baptism holy ghost just like the tabernacle as we were talking about you got your outer court which is where the laver the altar it's all messy you get sunshine you get rain and then all of a sudden you can walk inside that place right there in the middle and then the world is now beginning to go away from you all right you've got now the shoe bread and you've got the altar of incense which is inside that little place right there but also inside there's what the holy of holies and that's what you've got to get to listen it was death to go in there but it's death did not go in there now we must come boldly to the throne of grace and then we were talking about the ark of the covenant just to just to uh background for some that weren't here what was inside that box there's the box right there that's a replica of the ark of the covenant now remember the mercy seat is what's sitting on top of it where those two angels are everybody with me all right two cherubims but inside that inside that it's something three things kind of interesting three things there's the two tables of stone which is the which is the uh ten commandments that moses got from god then there's a little um basket that's got the manna which in other words that's what god produced also and then also there's that bud there's that there's that uh branch or that old dead stick now it used to be dead now it's got green on it all right but when they put it in there as we were talking the other day why did it go in there well you know why because listen wanted to be a minister and this one to be that this one to be a deacon and this one wasn't qualified but you're willing to do it anyway all right so god just said hey give me 12 sticks all dead i'm going to give them to my prophet moses he's going to put him in that ark right lamb right down in front of the ark and he said whoever's one that buds and grows almonds overnight he said that's the one you need to listen to all right so the ark is what the ark is a symbol of the son of man but it's also a symbol of who you as we said before look where brother brown talks about this in 1955 he said now watch the ark of the covenant now remember the ark of the covenant was not made out of pure gold no it was wood acacia wood overlaid with gold all right everybody with me because what you know why because this right here anyone knows the scripture that gold speaks of deity so the outside of that is deity and wood speaks of humanity that's why it had to be a rod that was put in the ark which symbolizes your humanity it also symbolizes that the great ark of the covenant which hung on calvary he was a mortal man y'all don't get sleepy on me now louise they did a little bit later than didn't you watch the ark of the covenant he said you make it out of a case you would and overlay it with gold anyone who knows the scripture knows that gold speaks of deity and wood speaks of humanity that's why it was hung on a cross that was wood and he said you shall cover it overlay it with gold over the wood that's deity over the wood thank god amen because he stands between the judgment that's inside of that box which was the ten commandments that what that would kill you but you had to go through the goal first to get to that that's deity over the wood christ over the church inside and out deity overlaid you'll have a lid on top of it it'll be a mercy seat and the law will rest in it you sprinkle it over the with the blood the law speaks of judgment but between the law and the congregation there was something for deity stood in its place atop of christ between the wrath of god the judgment in hell between that and the believer stands deity himself christ standing in the way with an atonement made to save us from our sins it wasn't bloodables it goes to the blood of a human man amen all right but it was the life in the blood that could come back inside of me and you to save us from our sins to heal us from our sicknesses deity stands in the way between judgment and what is it what is this talking about it's talking about our daily walk your daily talk your daily behavior your heart your soul he's talking about the priest going behind saying holy holy he had to walk a certain way because there was bells and pomegranates and they were ding ding ding all right as we began to approach on behalf of our brother in other words we're approaching for somebody whosoever will may come anointed blood in front of him and we know we talk about moses just for a minute we'll talk about just for a second where moses what he laid the rods up before the lord and then the next day moses went back in the tabernacle and guess what that old dead stick everybody raise your hand that will keep you from being asleep and wake the person up that don't raise the ham you're a stick you're a stick you ever heard the old saying you're sticking to mud well then but we're an old dead stick we were cut off of a tree we were supposed to come from the tree of life but we got cut off we got cut off like jesus did from the land of the living according to isaiah 53 he was cut off but what did he promise he promised us that he would plant us yes he would plant us by the river of rivers of living water that he would put us somewhere that our roots would what get inside but now remember what happens to a tree i watch my big pecan trees every once in a while outside and you see the wind blowing and you can barely i mean the leaves are wind is doing this but that big old tree is just barely moving you know why you know what the prophet said why because what's happening is it's pulling them roots back and forth and what it's doing it's loosening the dirt up so the roots can go deeper so your trials and tribulations and your wind of what your wind of the devil all it's doing is if you're a christian he's already planted you if you're a christian he's just making you stronger it can't make you weaker folks if you're a child of god that's why i said you say well i've got all these problems make sure you're born again how many times am i gonna have to say that make sure you're born again of the spirit of god then if you have trials you know how to handle it and it came to pass it on tomorrow moses walked in and brought those rods out and there was errands and it didn't just it didn't just uh put leaves on it but it took a process of several months to make an almond it did it overnight that's why god said tell them shut up aaron's going to be your spokesman aaron's going to be your preacher shut the rest of them up this is where i'm going to speak i'm going to speak to this person right here i'm going to speak to william branham that's my almond tree rod i'm going to speak through him and you're going to hear him and what's going to come forth from that he's going to plant us he planted you in the message of the hour didn't he planted you in this church he planted you wherever you've been planted romans 6 verse 4 says therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted now here see planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our what old man is crucified now listen when they put you on a cross we read that we'll read it again when they put you on a cross it wasn't for you to come back out it went for joy right it wasn't for christmas show it was to die you died and most of the time they left you hanging there and you can understand what happened to three months later in a dry area condition what happened to your body but our old man that's what's got to happen to the devil that's what's going to happen to the demons that's bothering us we got to nail them to that cross that the body of sin might be destroyed those things are going to make you happy destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin i'm tired of serving sin aren't you tired of serving sin even the little sins that we have as christians we sin every day for he that is dead is freed from sin for he that is dead that dead old stick but in god you need to start burning almonds fruits of the spirit right watch list this but aaron's rotting in there an old dead almond tree but as it went under the shekinah glory everything it was was restored again in other words that did grow on an almond tree somewhere had life in it had water in it had sap in it in other words and had the ability to become a have the green leaves and have the almonds but somebody the devil got involved and cut it down but everything it was was restored again that's the way a sinner is when he goes under the shekinah glory of the holy spirit the veil drops behind him everything that he ought to have been a son of god what blooms out in him again think about that we've had hundreds of thousands of of um we've got two big pecan trees out in the yard that produce one in the front one in the back that produce a lot there's no telling how many millions of pecans that thing produces every year it came from one plant and every once in a while bro luis you look out in the yard and you go that's not grass an old squirrel has went out there and dug him a hole stuck him up stuck him a pecan nut down in the ground and forgot it or either the dogs run it off or killed it or something but and then what does it happen it starts growing well every pecan that'll ever be on that tree is inside of that fruit that's why jesus said unless a corn of wheat be put in the ground and die it'll bite us alone but if it's planted it brings forth what much fruit much fruit so look remember overnight it budded blossomed and grown almost on it fruits of the spirit love joy long suffering goodness gentleness patience that's what we need to get in that third step get over into the shekinah glory where that little sacred light was hanging over the mercy seat why are my people so tossed about they took aaron's rod and laid aaron's rod in the presence of this holy place and when they did and one night's time it budded blossom and yielded almonds so don't tell me god can't do a work in your life overnight amen don't tell me god can't do a work in your life overnight he can and he will if you let's ask him to and one night's time think of it in the presence of god this old dead rod lying there in the presence of god but it blossomed yielded almonds and one night what was it then what kind of rod was it it was an almond tree rod that's what he'd taken it from the stick was off of an almond rod and you are a stick of some kind and you were taken off the branch of humanity which was god created son in the beginning you may be fallen dead alienated from god but by that in creation you were created to be a son of god you may bounce around and be respected and honored in other words out in the world but if you ever get into that glorious place and hide away with god you'll yield what you're supposed to do i'm telling you this is manifest in time we've seen that song manifest in time manifest time you're going to manifest what you've got inside of you can't hide it no more it will manifest itself and it is i mean it's just continuing to manifest itself and the only person that can do anything about is you like i said before you can't blame brother dale for not making it you are the one that will not make it if you don't make it all right so let's just put that finger back on us now every year the high priest entered into that place the congregation followed him up and when he went into this great place where the veil dropped behind him the inner courts the holiest of holies no one dared to go in after him he was alone with god what a beautiful picture it is today of a consecrated life who once enters into the with christ dead to the things of the world hid away with god and the veils dropped down around all the world shut off look then christianity and religion becomes a pleasure becomes a pleasure to every believer if it's drudgery and not a pleasure to come to church you need to get how many times i need to say that you need to get born again yeah but i talked to god i'm telling you what he said that's why if you'll read that book that brother dale preached a long time ago about the hidden life in christ if you read that book why my people are so tossed about he'll tell you why are you so tossed about he'll tell you what we're so tossed about christianity and religion becomes a pleasure to every believer you don't feel uncomfortable to go to church if you feel uncomfortable today get born again i used to feel uncomfortable mama called me it's mother's day i'm coming mom i'll be there you know it's christmas yeah mom i'll be there you know it's easter next time yeah i'll be there didn't want to be here no more nothing sorry why i wasn't born again now you can't get me out of this place if it weren't for brother anderson i'd be the first one here a lot of times so what brother now for years and years and years and years and years and years and years he was the first one here amen because christianity and religion becomes a pleasure every believer listen i sat thursday night and got three sermons two for today and one for bible study all afternoon and all up into what eight or nine o'clock at night didn't bother me it was a pleasure well i gotta hurry him get this done eh ball game's coming on well i did that on thursday so i could watch the ball game yesterday today people just have enough look have just enough i'm telling the truth people just have enough religion to make them miserable right have you seen miserable people that you can just look down june second ahead we know a couple of those that you just say just get born again start going to church start reading your bible there was a girl in our in our office um at the post office and her and her husband's been having some trouble and i think i told you a little bit about it but anyway they've been having some trouble at home and she's been talking to me well i can't counsel people that ain't christians you can tell them some good things to do but you can't say read your bible talk about the lord pray you know you you know get back in church so i asked her yesterday i said kelly shouldn't have called her name i said um how are you and garrett doing i call his name anyway how are you and garrett doing she said we had to come to jesus meet and i thought you don't know jesus i said you just came to a human meeting you didn't know jesus if you come to jesus jesus come to jesus meeting you go to church but that's why you really i mean how can you counsel somebody that's not a christian if they want christian counseling i mean what are you going to do first thing i tell donnie and susan is read your bible more pray more come church more pray to god more it thank you brother he said it works every one of us has been through that oh some of y'all don't clap because y'all just too young or too well never mind look today people have enough religion to make them miserable knowing that they ought to do this they're trying to escape hell wow that's why folks is listen it's only human nature let's just talk for men is that okay it's only human nature that when 9 11 happened what happened church churches filled up they had a day of prayer and you're not even supposed to be praying in school they had a national day of prayer because three thousand some people got killed i understand that and i they're human they were they had a family but then now what's happened 20 something years later those same churches that were full or empty let me give you another example this one's going to hit home and i hope it does a year ago when brother dale had a stroke standing in this pulpit a lot of people feel the church spews up after that they ain't here no more what'd they get an emotion they got an emotion they just gotta well i need to do something i hope you're quiet i hope that hit home listen white wait to a disaster happens to get in church why wait till a disaster happens to try to get right it's much easier to be right now and you say well praise god whatever happens happens everything's all right everything works for the good of them that love the lord we appreciate that but today people have enough religion just to make them miserable they're trying to escape hell how about a prophet of god standing one day and he said if i walk by the lord and he sends me to hell he said i'll look at him and say i love you anyway can you do that can you do that i love you anyway now we know for a fact if he said that brother larry he's going to heaven he ain't going to hell because he loved god so much didn't love god because now see because see you'll get under conviction and and here we go again i'm just going to head home we start all of our preachers start preaching that you need to come to church well more people start coming to church now that now that they've come eight or ten services they just start dwindling off why are my people so tossed about stable well if that's the way i felt about it brother i don't know what i would do oh get in with christ shut off from the things of the world to commune with him is a pleasure it's something that fills and satisfies your soul do you remember in the world what satisfied your soul drinking alcohol watching movies going out partying yeah that's what was inside of us but now that we have god inside of us that same emotion that same feeling you had for the world my heavens it ought to be a million times more for something eternal it ought to be something that satisfies your soul now listen it didn't same memory reason conscious affects your imagination because i feel a little rough right now okay everybody feels a little rough i got a little smacking on my head and somebody's preaching unsmacked my toes and then step on my toes i don't see how in the world you can read that hand right she writes in letters about like that she handed it to me yet last night i i read it though but it was hard write a little bigger but get into christ it's beautiful it's something that fills and satisfies your soul something that gives you peace that passes all understanding all the crosses become wings all the burdens are chariot wheels thanks god if you look at it that way brother johnny we're having a pretty good day all the burdens of chariot wheels oh you can fly away now he can let that spirit grow now look he can let that spirit grow and take all the roots of bitterness grow that's what we're talking about growing grow and take out all the root of bitterness and press god's way through him again he can become back in the same condition wow that he was when he was in the garden of eden you remember what happened in the garden after adam sinned he didn't want to go to church no more he didn't want to come in with god face to face anymore why he was ashamed he said i fear so they had to go back in the bushes and hide yes where where whatever before time millenniums before that brother john god would come down to cool today and said hey adam how you doing son you doing okay everything all right we good and adam's going we're good me and eve were one we're loving it we're enjoying all the fruits of the tree now we're not eating on that one you said not to eat us but his wife didn't get that revelation so when she did they did what they did remember he sold us out she didn't amen he sold us out right but he said you get you back in the same condition he was in the garden of eden how are we going to get an eden back here if we don't bring some of it with us already jesus said that mark 11 24 statue of a perfect man now we put the blood of jesus christ in see and that brings the faith of jesus christ the virtue of jesus christ the knowledge of jesus christ not wade dale's knowledge not bob black or whoever the temperance of jesus christ not mine not yours his the patience of jesus christ the godliness of jesus christ the brotherhood brother the kindness of jesus christ listen these are these are heirs and joint heirs this is what he got so now he's giving it to us yes we're heirs and joint heirs according to romans 8 i read that to you heirs and join airs with christ that's the nature of christ there you are there is the perfect man of god when he possesses these virtues and now that's the chart we're looking at we not even got to the son of man anymore we're back down here in the son of god where the disciples were we're down here where the first three church ages had these virtues working in their life they had everything common but there was people crept in and started tearing the word of god up started putting their own ideas jesus said your own traditions you've made the word of god of no effect to the people but now we're right down here right where it says new birth justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost all right then that's before we got two wings tonight there's three types of crosses there's an enemy of a cross there's people that get to the cross and then there's people that carry the cross all right now jesus is the one that carried his cross one time he didn't have to carry it again he carried it one time he died once for all that's right amen so then there's enemies of the cross that they just don't even like the cross at all they don't care anything about religion or anything about uh worshiping god they worship their own god but and we'll read that where the bible tells us about enemies of the cross and then like i said wednesday there's people that get to the cross and they say god forgive me in my sins i am so sorry for what i did look at the thief on the cross remember listen the thief on the cross never asked jesus to forgive his sins the thief on the cross never asked jesus to forgive him of his sins he said will you remember me when you come into your kingdom will you just remember me it humbled that man so much and jesus turned around he said this day in other words i'm going to die and then you're going to die because he died first and they broke his leg and he died he said you'll be with me in paradise in other words he stepped over into paradise and like i said before he's one he's one of the ones that stayed there just a very small amount of time because remember paradise was emptied out when jesus came back but he made it remember me just remember me lord but you and i have an opportunity to say forgive me lord and then he won't put you in paradise he'll put you in the sixth dimension and then we'll go to the future home that makes bride yes sir brad don't just get to the cross they carry their own cross the cross was made out of wood overlaid with gold deity jesus hung on a cross there was wood behind him deity and then the people he stood in the way he stood the judgment oh if that don't make you happy then y'all don't need to get born again based on roman literature as well as descriptions in the province's crucifixion was an established routine they were special military teams led by centurion and then the provinces the soldiers were selected from local auxiliaries natives who had joined the roman army the victim was stripped and then lashed or scourged as part of the public humiliation as i said before not in this article but another article if you'll remember what i was telling you and it makes sense if if brother darty you're sitting there and i'm picking on you if brother doherty was a murderer and he killed somebody like barabbas that's not going to incite a riot he just killed another man we'll just do away with him but oh when somebody stands up and said destroy this temple i'll raise it up then he gets a rally around him he gets some people around him then you get the political guy that stands up and says follow me i'll make everything right yeah right that's who they killed they wanted to publicly humiliate those people to keep other people from saying oh we'll follow him no they're going to throw him on the cross and then we're going to forget him so it's part of the public humiliation he or she was led through the streets and remained naked christian art portrays jesus with a decent lawn cloth on the cross but the nakedness was maintained as a part of his humiliation there was a public plaque remember there was a plaque put over him by by uh who was the pilot the shedding of blood and the concept of corpse contamination meant that the execution took place outside the city walls the most popular spot was along one of the main roads leading into the city they also served as propaganda purposes to demonstrate roman law and order now look the victim did not carry the whole cross and that's true because that cross weighed almost 400 pounds big beam i mean had to hold the weight of a 200 pound man but they carried the crossbeam the pole was already in the ground but they carried the crossbeam which there's our first beam so we're talking about winning tonight i hope you got that that's there's your beam faith you got to have that you got to carry it take up your cross and follow jesus what take up your cross every day all right by the baptism of the holy ghost we don't just come to the cross we pick up our cross and we follow him and we don't pick up his cross we don't have to die he died already now we know what all this other was was that's why the assignment of cyrene picked up the beam of jesus and carried him and then the victim was either tied or nailed to the cross we know jesus was nailed to the cross because he showed nail prints in his hands so now philippians 3 verse 18. we'll stop we'll stop right here for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you even weeping look weeping paul was serious that they are the enemies of the cross of christ who so end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things wow colossians 2 verse 14 says blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it what nailing that gold to the cross nailing deity dedicated unto death nailing him to the cross showed that we were forgiven wow first corinthians 1 17 for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect that's what the people done that's why brother branham that's why paul's talking here and brother brown stands in this age and he turns and he points and he says i indict this generation for the second crucifixion of jesus christ they put him back on the cross and put him to an open shame for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishly but unto us which are saved it is the power of god amen matthew 10 verse 37 he that loveth father and mother more than me everybody go he that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me i was talking to somebody the other day i told him i said and i preached it from the pulpit so his brother dale your kids are watching you your wayward family or your wife or somebody that's not a believer are watching you and when you compromise you know what they're gonna do they're gonna say oh okay they really just don't have what they what they think they have and believe you me if your kids live out of town they gonna get there on saturday night or they gonna fly in on sunday morning so you can go pick them up hello somebody just don't get quiet on me i tell them to take an uber i'm not going to get them on sunday i'm coming to church would you no it's my cuz i haven't seen my baby in so long they're watching you to see what you'll do how many times the brother dale told us that 50 years he said your kids are watching you and it happens all the time happens all the time well my kids are coming in town this weekend this weekend why can't they get here on friday and leave on sunday jim's dad used to do that so much what'd we tell him it's okay gene you can come whenever you want to but sunday you'll be there by yourself or you can come go to church with us and he'd come to church most of the time but he would sit at home sometime because i'm not compromising because it you know in his mind he's going well is he or is he not is he or is he not he that loveth father mother more than me is not worthy i'm reading bible this is red letter i didn't make this it's red letter that comes out of the king james version okay it's not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me i told my kids josh is not here they're on vacation over actually they're over jim's dad's house but i told my kids i said look i love you i'll take a bullet for you i'll die for you but i'm not compromising my religion not for you ain't gonna happen because this scripture right here and what inside of me tells me this is my first obligation all right more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it matthew 16 says then jesus said unto his disciples holy this is jesus talking okay hold up everybody if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever shall save his life shall lose it who's referred i lose shall for my sake shall find it mark 8 34 he called his people together with his disciples he said unto them whoso will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me now this is one i like luke brings it in just really really daily and he's saying to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me it's a daily walk for whosoever shall save his life shall lose it whosoever shall lose his life for my sake the same shall save it first corinthians 15 musicians come on i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily there's something in our life and listen there's something in all our lives that we can't get rid of am i in the wrong church there's things that we have that just bothers us all the time work on them give them to god whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple we'll start i think i got let me read this right here i'm gonna read this and i'll come back and read it this afternoon let's stand our feed blasphemous names brother brown says look so now you say brother brother do we should we speak with tongues absolutely now he's talking on the statue of perfect man because he preached famous names a week later but he basically preaches the whole sermon about the statue of perfect man a little bit about black famous names he's he's reiterating what he said that's gifts of god what speaking in tongues we're not talking about speaking in tongues in this there's not that on there right that's gifts of god but those gifts of god they're speaking in tongues without these virtues in them makes a stumble block to the unbeliever look it's not accepted by god now do we want anything that's not accepted by god no we do not this has to be first what this and when you have faith virtue knowledge tempers faces guidelines and brotherly love then the holy ghost comes down and what seals you as a unit we'll get into that a little bit later the same as he seals the church ages as a unit the way he makes his bride is the way he makes his individual made out of the same material like eve was made out of adam a rip from his side here is the thing that you have to have first you can't impersonate them you can't imitate them you've got to be god sent and god born look imitation only causes confusion you know why you act one way here and then you act another way somewhere else that virtue doesn't follow you out that door you pretend here and then you lose it out there wow wow wow wow listen i'm gonna read this one more then we'll sing a song if what is purposed to the church the life that was in christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still if you haven't got patience virtue and all these things temperance and these things and godliness brother kindness and all these things that's what required of you required and i'm going to read three more quotes this afternoon where brother brown says this is god's requirement is to have these virtues to be now does not look you say well am i i'm i'm i can i be a child of god and i'll have the virtues yes justification sanitification back to the holy ghost put you right here at face you may have parts of these but you're not going to be what god's not going to let a baby drive his car you got to be a fully matured adult before you can drive a car so god's not going to give you the word of god because look i will read this later on where brother brown says power without character listen you have that dunamis power when you're born again but you can't let it all out because you don't know how to use it but once you get these virtues you know how to use it in other words zapping your boss out of existence you pray for him that's right or her these things that's required of you let's sing a song god bless you we find many people who can't understand why i am so happy and free for jordan to canaan's fatherland and this is like heaven to me heavenly places heavenly places do you feel comfortable talking about god do you feel comfortable coming to church do you feel comfortable witnessing to people if you don't feel comfortable then you need to get the comforter inside of you i see but i'm filled with the spirit there isn't a doubt and that's what's the matter with me oh this is like heaven to me oh this is like heaven to me i've crossed over jordan to canaan's fatherland and this is like heaven to me this is like heaven to me and by heaven oh this is like heaven to me i've crossed over jordan to cadence fire land and this is like heaven to me can you say today that ain't nothing but the truth i've tried to tell you the truth this ain't nothing but the truth it's what god's already said it's not something he developed it's not something brother brown came and brought us a new bible no he came to magnify the bible is already here and to tell us why all these pieces have to fit together nobody down through the ages luther wesley and even pentecost ever i'm sure they preached on ii peter but they didn't know how to get virtue they just said peter said to get it but when brother rhino comes and tells us look that virtue is not being a virgin that virtue is having the power of god inside of you to be able to give it to somebody else that's virtue that strength like i said before if i'm sick sure i pray to god but if i'm sick i call brother dale i don't call the neighbor they're gay sorry would you no i call somebody's men to the fountain i call somebody i got confidence in that i know that i can draw strength from him that's what each and every one of us i draw strength from brother ryan standing up here preaching the word of god and all the different ones sunday school teacher you should draw strength off of that folks if this is a drudgery you need to get born again or quit one of the two if you hang around you're gonna drown like the millions and billions drowned in the days of noah i'll promise you that pitch had a lot of fingernails on it as that water kept getting higher and higher because brother brown said i read it last night they hung around the door well i wonder and then guess what one day noah didn't shut the door god shut the door noah was probably on the inside saying lord it's not raining one more day give me just one more day god said i've given 120 years as i told you all the other day sister gail may heard me she's always said guard's arm is long it is but it's got an end to it amen you might be filthy rich but there's a bottom of that barrel amen so god's arm's long no doubt he's got a lot of grace in it but there's the time when he said that's enough i'm done with it so god shut the door did it rain the first day knew it it rained the second day no rain the third day no fourth day he said miss noah come up and said honey are you it will rain he said how do you know he he said cause god said so seven days they stayed in that ark but you know what on that seventh day brother brown said out in the distance there came a cloud that never been there before and that cloud started swirling he said it started pouring down rain and he said then people knew on the outside of that boat what was fixing to happen because they had been told 120 years that it was going to rain and flood the earth with water this bower heads the lord jesus thank you for this day you give us i pray that you just be with us now and we go get us a bite to eat and come back together to hear from you father we pray that you just be with each one lord prick our hearts as on the day of pentecost where peter preached a wonderful little 15 or 20 minute sermon and they were pricked in their hearts and they said many brethren what must we do to be saved peter said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and right there 3 000 people received the holy ghost wow they were added to the church what a powerful word we have if we'll just listen to it lord thank you for all things that you give us lord
