[8:06] good to be back in the house with the
[8:08] Lord thank you all for your prayers and
[8:11] um
[8:11] all the ones that took over while uh
[8:14] I was taking a little r r and uh
[8:18] Lord supplied me with a with my best
[8:22] deer to this day so that's good thank
[8:23] you Lord for that I appreciate it
[8:26] um I think dressed 220 pounds
[8:29] and uh I told David
[8:32] uh the boy was up here with me he's 70
[8:33] years old and uh I said you know we were
[8:37] struggling with this big old deer and
[8:40] I looked at him I said David you know
[8:41] there's 132 years of people down here
[8:43] trying to get this deer out of the woods
[8:45] it's only me and you
[8:47] he was 70 and I'm 62 so
[8:50] it's just uh a struggle when you get
[8:54] older just to walk us let's try to get a
[8:55] heavy deer out of the woods but God God
[8:57] had that deer die right in a at a tree
[9:01] that was growing like this so we just
[9:02] hoisted it up the tree with the Polaris
[9:04] and drove the Polaris under it and set
[9:05] it on it and come on so I appreciate
[9:07] your prayers thank you for taking care
[9:09] of brother Andrew Glover he did a
[9:10] wonderful job this weekend
[9:13] and we appreciate him for that and uh
[9:17] um I wanted to say brother Bob will be
[9:19] preaching next Wednesday night
[9:22] um for a week from today or a week from
[9:24] tomorrow actually
[9:25] and um and y'all all have a Happy
[9:28] Thanksgiving eat a lot of Turkey
[9:30] whatever you do see your family
[9:34] see somebody
[9:35] see your family church family doesn't
[9:37] matter it's two you see them but see
[9:39] your natural family
[9:40] we've had so many reports
[9:43] of of shining the light you know we want
[9:46] to we want to um
[9:48] give this message to everybody
[9:51] we just think everybody ought to take it
[9:53] and everybody ought to see it like we
[9:54] see it
[9:56] but remember brother Brown said the
[9:57] preaching the sermon is not it it's
[9:59] living one
[10:00] and we've seen in the past few months
[10:04] um how that our little light that shines
[10:06] out of this Sanctuary through you
[10:09] has portrayed into other people that
[10:12] said they really wanted to be
[10:14] a part of that a part of the uh not
[10:17] exclusion
[10:19] but you know let God exclude the people
[10:22] let's not do it ourselves you never know
[10:24] you never ever know
[10:26] who's watching
[10:28] and the ones that are watching sometimes
[10:30] are watching to refute but but when they
[10:32] find nothing to refute what do they do
[10:35] what do they do they say oh man this is
[10:38] this must be real these people must
[10:40] really live what they're preaching I I
[10:43] was thinking about it while I was in uh
[10:45] Illinois that you know it's just it all
[10:47] comes down to your to your foundation
[10:50] it all comes down to your foundation
[10:52] everything is built on a foundation this
[10:54] even the Empire State Building is built
[10:57] on a foundation
[10:58] so we're built on a foundation all right
[11:00] and we were built here on the foundation
[11:02] of the word of God and then let's let
[11:04] that out let your light so shine the
[11:07] Bible says to the world all right so now
[11:10] remember this coming

[14:15] I love his word I love to just meditate
[14:18] on his word and to hear what he has to
[14:19] say
[14:20] to the Bride of Jesus Christ he's trying
[14:23] to get the world to see and you know
[14:25] what he's going to get them to see
[14:26] through not that Bible right there he's
[14:28] going to get him to see through you
[14:30] good or bad

[14:34] amen they're looking at us all the time
[14:37] our kids and our aunts our uncles our
[14:39] in-laws are they're all watching to see
[14:43] as brother Ram said one time a man
[14:45] brother Claude was talking about
[14:46] yesterday
[14:47] people are now coming into church
[14:49] services and they're looking online and
[14:51] watching Services of brother Brown was
[14:53] to refute brother Brown said it will be
[14:55] in the end time it wouldn't be that
[14:56] you'll sit down in a church service to
[14:58] get something is people be sent down to
[15:00] refute what you're saying try to find
[15:02] something wrong with them you know wrong
[15:03] with it you know there wasn't 12 men
[15:05] fell off a bridge so they just take wipe
[15:08] off the whole sir whole 1100 sermons but
[15:11] they don't understand it when a man
[15:13] stands up and says if God doesn't meet
[15:15] me here
[15:17] I'm a false prophet
[15:19] and he'll stand there and 20 or 30
[15:21] people he'll tell them where they were
[15:22] what size clothes they wear what house
[15:25] number well they were on a telephone
[15:26] yesterday and he sat there and just
[15:27] poured their life out
[15:29] they're gonna have to meet
[15:31] they want me brother random folks
[15:33] they'll meet Jesus Christ
[15:35] because that's who brother Brown was
[15:36] trying to present so let's bow our heads

[16:04] um a little rest and relaxation and and
[16:07] hobbies that we do Lord I Thank you for
[16:09] letting us do that
[16:11] but Lord your word is the most important
[16:13] so we've come today Lord to hear from
[16:15] you father I pray that you'd be the ones
[16:18] that are sick be your brother down all
[16:19] the different ones brother Mike OT the
[16:21] ones that are that are mending Lord and
[16:23] getting better father we pray this

[16:27] father bless the missionaries and the
[16:28] Foreign Fields be with them Lord give
[16:31] them fruit for their labor father they
[16:32] labor way more than we do Lord but we
[16:35] need to pray for them more and more as
[16:38] the day approaches where they're not
[16:39] going to be able to get out and deliver
[16:41] the message Father let us live this
[16:44] message
[16:45] let us be this message let it not be
[16:47] paper and pencil and ink but in the
[16:50] fleshly tables
[16:52] of our heart Lord just be with us and
[16:54] further in this service in Jesus name we
[16:56] pray
[16:57] amen
[16:58] well now remember we the last time we
[17:01] spoke we spoke on the power of your
[17:03] thoughts and I hope you got something a
[17:04] little bit about that so we're going to
[17:06] we're going to come back together now
[17:07] and into who is this on a man part 70
[17:10] and we're going to look at a few things
[17:13] as far as what did we leave
[17:16] because we left some we left something
[17:19] we left something Jude tells us that we
[17:23] left that first phase we left uh what
[17:26] was it the thotara different you left
[17:28] your first love Ephesians you left this
[17:30] you left they all you took a name that
[17:32] you shouldn't took there's all these
[17:34] things you messed up that we all messed
[17:36] up with
[17:37] and we did it not God but he allowed it
[17:40] to happen what to prove that he's right
[17:42] to prove that his word is right and he
[17:44] did have a bride in every Church age
[17:46] that he sealed away under their
[17:49] messenger they got the message they got
[17:51] the Revelation so same way with me and
[17:53] you we got to get the revelation of this
[17:55] message but it has to go that we go back
[17:58] to the faith of the fathers
[18:01] pick up the correct interpretation of
[18:04] the word and bring it forward to where
[18:06] brother Branham was then say he said
[18:08] it's not in the years of preparation not
[18:10] in these years of the in other words the
[18:12] prayer lines and and all these things he
[18:15] said it's in the opening of the word the
[18:16] seven seal the opening of the seals
[18:18] bring it up higher to bring it up to
[18:20] what the statue of a perfect man where
[18:21] the Capstone is not just the building
[18:23] part all right we're at the part where
[18:26] the Cap's going to fit down over
[18:27] everything that we do and everything
[18:29] that we are is going to fit on something
[18:31] because the capstone's coming folks he's
[18:33] not just well you can pray all you want
[18:35] to Lord Jesus is coming
[18:37] and he's coming into people you can
[18:40] hinder it if you want to and I'm saying
[18:41] for everybody we can all and we do
[18:43] hinder it what we're trying to do is
[18:45] what shed that off
[18:49] think right the power of your thoughts
[18:52] you think right you get right with God
[18:55] and we'll get to right brother around
[18:56] said the right mental attitude
[18:59] toward any promise boy wow the right
[19:02] mental attitude toward any promise of
[19:04] God
[19:05] will bring it to pass in the beginning
[19:06] was the word words with God and the Word
[19:09] was God and the Word was made flesh
[19:11] and dwelt among us and we behold his
[19:13] glory the glory the only begotten of the
[19:15] father
[19:16] full of grace
[19:17] and truth that is the son of man that is
[19:20] God in human flesh everybody with me on
[19:22] that that is him but he what now she is
[19:25] him so now you and I are going to take
[19:27] over that part and be that what full of
[19:31] grace and truth we're going to be the
[19:32] ones that that dwelt Among Us
[19:35] see God's Among Us now he's Among Us in
[19:37] his people all right so God's among us
[19:40] every time we assemble together we get
[19:42] people together
[19:44] God's in the midst God's doing the work
[19:47] first Thessalonians says that every one
[19:49] of you should know how to put every one
[19:51] of us
[19:52] you can't stop you stop yeah you stop
[19:54] God but you can't you say well I just
[19:56] I've been in this message 30 years and I
[19:58] just don't understand nothing well you
[20:00] know what
[20:01] you just said the little word you
[20:04] don't understand nothing
[20:08] you stopped it somewhere
[20:11] because you can look back and if you
[20:13] want to start a checklist or whatever
[20:14] you want to start like I said before you
[20:17] know you start with with with coming to
[20:19] church and you then doing the things of
[20:21] God and reading your Bible and studying
[20:23] we all need to do that we all need to do
[20:25] that but there comes a point in time
[20:27] where that becomes part of us
[20:32] not a struggle to get to it
[20:35] it's because Jesus never struggled being
[20:38] God
[20:39] never did he struggle never did he stand
[20:42] up and go
[20:43] I just ain't gonna be God today
[20:46] he said I only do that what the father
[20:48] showed me
[20:50] I only do that what the father shows me
[20:52] you say well we can't do that with a
[20:54] carnal mind it says you can because we
[20:57] need what a renewing of our mind as
[20:59] we're going to read here in a minute
[21:00] that but it says that every one of you
[21:02] so Paul didn't exclude anybody
[21:06] in Thessalonians he didn't exclude no
[21:08] one he said that every one of you should
[21:11] know how to possess your I can't possess
[21:14] your vessel
[21:15] right
[21:17] preacher can't possess your vessel
[21:19] you can allow God to possess your vessel
[21:22] through the speaking of the word but it
[21:24] has to be by the Holy Ghost it can't be
[21:27] by a person it's got to be by the holy
[21:30] ghost that knows how to possess this
[21:32] vessel in what sanctification and honor
[21:34] Romans 12 2 and then you can sit down be
[21:36] you not conformed to this world but be
[21:39] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[21:42] that you may prove
[21:44] you're going to prove one way or the
[21:46] other if you're of God or you're of the
[21:48] devil you want to prove it
[21:49] all right
[21:51] by the renewing of your mind that you
[21:53] may prove what is that good and
[21:54] acceptable and perfect
[21:56] will of God you may be seated in the
[21:58] Lord has blessing
[21:59] to reading his word
[22:01] and I want to clear something up a
[22:03] little bit as we've been talking
[22:06] um about heart and and the different
[22:09] things we're not ever talking about when
[22:12] God talks about the heart of man it's
[22:14] not this thing right here
[22:16] people
[22:18] it's the car the Apple the chorus the
[22:21] chorus the centers the heart of the
[22:24] Apple so it's the heart that we're
[22:25] talking about the soul is what we're
[22:28] talking about but it is the heart of you
[22:31] it is your heart it is your
[22:34] being
[22:36] now when you're being leaves your body
[22:40] that thing that's thumping quits working
[22:43] everybody with me so that's not the
[22:45] important part
[22:46] we're going to read Paul where we talk
[22:48] about where he talks about warring
[22:50] against that flesh
[22:52] but you don't War if you're born again
[22:54] you don't worry about you don't war in
[22:56] your soul
[22:58] that's what I've been trying to get you
[22:59] must if you're born again you can't
[23:01] there's no way you can fall there's no
[23:03] way you can worry about your soul if
[23:06] you're born again it's God
[23:08] it's perfect
[23:11] but
[23:12] we were born in sin so we have a another
[23:15] section that we have to deal with
[23:18] which is a spirit a spirit being called
[23:21] memory reason conscious affection and
[23:23] Imagination all right
[23:25] now what did Jesus say in Matthew 12 34
[23:27] he said oh Generation of Vipers how can
[23:30] you being evil speak good things now
[23:32] he's talking about now look he says how
[23:35] you being evil speak good things
[23:38] they did everything right in the church
[23:42] the whole world was deceived by him
[23:45] except one man
[23:46] right
[23:48] Caiaphas was the man he was the one we
[23:50] depended on if you were a Jew you
[23:52] depended on conflicts to go into that
[23:54] holy of holies sprinkle that seven times
[23:57] and make sure that our sins were
[23:59] forgiven and that was Caiaphas and we we
[24:02] put everything on campus the high priest
[24:05] he would come out he said okay your sins
[24:07] are forgiven well then you got Jesus
[24:09] standing there saying you're a Viper
[24:13] because he saw Into the Heart of the
[24:15] people
[24:16] oh generation of operas how can ye being
[24:18] evil speak good things
[24:21] for out of the abundance of the heart
[24:24] the cardia the cardiologist the cardio
[24:26] the cardiac your heart
[24:29] your soul the mouth speaketh
[24:33] think about how we used to speak I'm
[24:35] sorry but you know if you didn't have a
[24:38] filthy mouth then you you still was lost
[24:42] right come on somebody you still was
[24:44] lost we ain't know I'm good well I only
[24:46] curse three times in my life you curse
[24:48] before I'm better than you are no that
[24:49] don't mean one thing amen I would say
[24:52] Peter being an old fisherman I'm sure he
[24:54] probably said some words a little
[24:56] awkward before he got born again but
[24:59] Jesus said Satan is going to sift you
[25:02] like saying Peter but I prayed for you
[25:04] well you know what Satan's going to sift
[25:06] us like Sam but God Prayed For Us in
[25:08] Saint John 17 God prayed a prayer that
[25:11] we would make it
[25:13] that we would be one as he and the
[25:15] father are one
[25:19] that was um
[25:22] I don't know where is that I was
[25:23] somewhere preaching them oh it was here
[25:25] we had visitors here and when I was
[25:27] talking about us being one-ness and you
[25:30] know we we bashed the Oneness and we
[25:32] bashed the Trinity and we're a bunch of
[25:33] Tunis you know Jesus over there and
[25:35] we're over here we can't get over there
[25:37] and we're not good enough to be over
[25:39] there all right Saint John 17 says
[25:43] let us be one
[25:45] asked my father in Heaven's one was it
[25:47] two
[25:50] that's why we haven't come to
[25:52] we haven't come to real
[25:57] still takes over
[25:59] Paul tells us that we're unworthy that
[26:01] we're lost that we can't get it we can't
[26:04] make it listen if God
[26:07] is God
[26:09] I was thinking about this the other day
[26:11] before the foundation of the world
[26:13] obviously he knew what was going to
[26:15] happen
[26:16] right
[26:18] and he let it happen
[26:20] he'd make it happen
[26:22] he put He he laid the canvas out
[26:26] and he put man down here on that canvas
[26:28] and said here take care of it but he
[26:30] knew as soon as he made Satan the whole
[26:32] thing was going to mess up
[26:34] but he continued and let him do it he's
[26:37] let us live our life he knew we were
[26:39] going to fall he knew we were going to
[26:41] stumble he knew we were going to be lost
[26:43] but he knew that one day we'd come to a
[26:45] realization that we needed him
[26:47] and then what would he do he filled us
[26:49] then with the Holy Ghost
[26:52] not that we walked around with it all of
[26:53] our life
[26:56] the things I did the Holy Ghost was
[26:58] nowhere to be found
[27:00] oh yeah he was there he was there but he
[27:02] wasn't he wasn't proud to be anywhere
[27:05] close to where I was at I don't know
[27:07] about y'all sometimes y'all look at me
[27:08] like I'm just real bad y'all real good
[27:10] so that's okay
[27:11] maybe y'all never went through these
[27:13] things I don't know
[27:14] but I did and I'm just honest enough to
[27:16] tell you about it
[27:18] but look at verse 35 look a good man out
[27:21] of the good treasure we're going to look
[27:23] at that just a few minutes uh out of the
[27:25] good treasure I looked at word up
[27:27] treasure all right so and he says that
[27:29] the Bible says it twice
[27:31] so we need to watch what's saying Jesus
[27:33] said a good man out of the good treasure
[27:38] of the soul may we say that because he's
[27:40] not talking about the heart he's talking
[27:42] about the soul a good man has a good
[27:44] Treasure of his soul bringing forth good
[27:46] things an evil man out of the evil
[27:49] Treasure of his soul bringeth forth evil
[27:52] things that's why we were evil we were
[27:55] lost we were undone we did the things of
[27:57] the world why something inside of us
[27:59] made us do it
[28:00] and we just said okay
[28:03] wow because we had a carnal of mine
[28:05] now watch in second Corinthians four I
[28:07] thought we'd read some scriptures
[28:08] tonight being Tuesday night middle of
[28:10] the week not so much as teaching but
[28:12] read some scriptures watch this but if
[28:14] our gospel up being hid
[28:17] it is hid to them that are lost
[28:19] okay
[28:21] if our gospel be hit Paul said it is hid
[28:24] to them that are lost now he's talking
[28:25] to the Corinthians everybody with me
[28:27] here and whom the God of this world now
[28:29] that's little Jesus so the God of this
[28:31] world is who Satan and whom the God of
[28:34] this world hath blinded the minds
[28:38] not the hearts
[28:40] the minds
[28:42] you can be born again
[28:45] and your mind be blinded
[28:48] come on somebody
[28:49] Martin Luther his soul never had a
[28:53] trinitarian idea but his mind did
[28:56] his mind was affected by Satan I'm sorry
[28:59] yeah he was a church-aged messenger but
[29:01] God never in no way preached a
[29:04] trinitarian Doctrine through Martin
[29:05] Luther
[29:07] but now since we've come back to the
[29:10] faith of the fathers where they didn't
[29:11] teach it either that's why we had to
[29:13] come back to it and get these major
[29:15] doctrines down right I was talking about
[29:17] the call last night we're talking about
[29:18] the church age but I cannot see how
[29:20] anybody in this message cannot use a
[29:22] church age book
[29:25] to further
[29:27] your walk with God
[29:29] that church age book has got every major
[29:31] Doctrine
[29:32] of the Bible and everything you need is
[29:35] in that church age book
[29:37] but they call it a woman's book just
[29:39] because she typed it up
[29:41] anyway
[29:42] I don't see how you can take that is a
[29:44] very vital part you know we don't agree
[29:46] with that we we use a church age book
[29:48] all the time actually one brother was we
[29:50] were hunting with years ago and he said
[29:52] I asked just a woman's butt Lee Vail
[29:54] wrote it and listened out and the other
[29:55] night and the other and I said well
[29:57] brother I started to call his name I
[29:59] said brother I said my daddy's preaching
[30:02] tomorrow
[30:03] I said you better hold on to your seat
[30:05] he's going to read at least one quote
[30:08] out of that churches book he read four
[30:12] and the brother in the back was sitting
[30:13] beside me and I poked him I said told
[30:15] you what he's going to do I said that
[30:17] church age book is important or you
[30:19] can't preach the full message of the
[30:20] hour without that church but
[30:22] we don't need to give out steel books
[30:24] yet we need to give our churches books
[30:26] we need somebody to learn the what the
[30:27] foundation the doctrinal issues right if
[30:30] you don't have your Doctrine that's my
[30:32] brother Brown he had to come to get the
[30:33] doctrine right
[30:35] all right the foundation right so that
[30:37] zerubbabel can build this mountain of
[30:40] 1100 sermons that you and I are supposed
[30:42] to listen to and so then that the cap
[30:45] could fit on top of all that
[30:47] which is the culmination it's just Jesus
[30:50] Christ all the way up but it's now going
[30:52] to be in its fullness
[30:54] and where you and I listen listen you're
[30:57] not going to fight with your soul as
[30:58] much as you used to now there's going to
[31:00] be a fight brother Brown said you you're
[31:01] going to be sticky to the end but it's
[31:03] going to be less and less
[31:05] I just believe that because what's
[31:07] keeping us now is our carnal mind that
[31:09] said I don't know if I can do that or
[31:10] not
[31:12] I don't know if I'm good enough to do
[31:13] that or not I even say that brother Val
[31:15] says it all everybody does you got that
[31:17] little thing that's in your mind that
[31:18] little one little point
[31:20] body change
[31:23] I don't know if I can do that or not
[31:26] well if you don't you won't
[31:30] but you gotta what
[31:33] the power of your thoughts
[31:37] think on these things
[31:40] if you think on what the world says we
[31:43] were up there hunting this week and
[31:45] there's a guy there that he's an almost
[31:46] Christian guy
[31:48] and uh he was talking about wearing
[31:49] masks and you know being under a Kobe
[31:51] thing he lived in Colorado and uh he
[31:54] said I walked into whatever it was and
[31:56] and they were that whatever that County
[31:57] was you had to wear a mask and then
[32:00] Matthew was inside the house you know so
[32:02] David goes through the goes through CV
[32:04] line and CVS to get some medication or
[32:06] something and he don't have a mask on
[32:08] and he said they're going ah what are
[32:10] you doing trying to kill us he looked at
[32:11] him he said you all gonna die anyway
[32:15] so
[32:18] you gonna die sometime
[32:21] so but that's the world the world says
[32:23] okay we live
[32:25] we're born we live and we die right
[32:28] Through the Ages is always born live and
[32:30] die something's got to break that
[32:32] Chain's got to break in there somewhere
[32:34] because there's got to be a group of
[32:35] people
[32:37] that says that's not going to happen to
[32:38] me
[32:39] and it doesn't matter if you're 80 or 90
[32:40] years old you say well I ain't got no
[32:42] chance I'm older than everybody else
[32:43] that doesn't have one thing to do with
[32:45] it Abraham was 99 years old when God
[32:47] changed his body hello somebody boy you
[32:50] ought to make your shout we ain't all 99
[32:51] yet sister cleator
[32:55] I said yeah
[32:56] but if our gospel be hid it's him to
[32:59] them that are lost let's get through
[33:00] this and look at whom the God of this
[33:03] world hath blinded the minds of them
[33:06] which believe not
[33:08] lest the light of the Glorious gospel of
[33:11] Christ who is the image of God should
[33:14] shine unto them that's what I was just
[33:16] talking about that light's going to
[33:17] shine through me and you it's going to
[33:20] shine that what is the image of God
[33:24] there it is right there that's the image
[33:26] of God that we've got to get to all
[33:28] right and you say well I can't who's
[33:30] made it well there's been a lot of
[33:32] people in the first three Church ages
[33:33] had all of these virtues working in
[33:36] their life so it should be not so hard
[33:39] for us to just read the Bible
[33:42] and see the virtues working in the book
[33:44] of Acts and Corinthians and and Romans
[33:47] and all the different ones they're by
[33:49] with me right so you see that's why
[33:51] we're here we are we're pushing it well
[33:53] that was for them no
[33:55] Jude says I'll read in just a few
[33:57] minutes that that we got to get back to
[33:59] that faith that was once delivered to
[34:01] the Saints all right
[34:03] and whom the God of this world is blind
[34:05] but see that what it is so watch Satan
[34:07] doing he's making you believe you can't
[34:10] do it
[34:13] because can God tell you you can't make
[34:15] it
[34:17] he'd be a liar
[34:20] everybody he wanted everybody to be
[34:22] saved you anybody can make it Adolf
[34:24] Hitler could have made a defeated give
[34:26] his life to Christ
[34:27] okay all right so we're there
[34:29] lest the light of the Glorious gospel of
[34:32] Christ who is the image of God should
[34:34] shine unto them watch this for we preach
[34:36] not ourself let's talk about remember
[34:37] the other day we don't pray we don't we
[34:39] don't put ourselves above anybody
[34:42] we are servants We Serve the People
[34:46] for we preach not ourselves but Christ
[34:48] Jesus the Lord and ourselves what your
[34:52] servants for Christ's sake
[34:54] all right and then Paul stands up one
[34:55] day and says you'll be judged by my
[34:57] gospel what gospel is that it wasn't
[34:59] Paul's gospel
[35:00] it was the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[35:03] for God who commanded the light to shine
[35:06] out of Darkness so he commanded it so
[35:08] it's going to happen
[35:09] hath shined in our what hearts
[35:14] in our soul
[35:16] if you're born again the light of God is
[35:18] not shining in your soul it is your soul
[35:21] to get look to give the light of the
[35:24] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[35:27] face of Jesus Christ what these virtues
[35:30] Paul didn't know how to call them
[35:31] virtues but he's preaching the virtues
[35:33] right here
[35:34] because watch this but we have this
[35:36] treasure
[35:38] we have this treasure that's the second
[35:40] time treasure is used we have this
[35:42] treasure in Earthen vessels that the
[35:46] Excellency
[35:47] of the power may be of God and not of us
[35:51] all right now watch what is that what
[35:54] does that word treasure mean the place
[35:56] in which good and precious things are
[35:59] collected
[36:00] and light up
[36:03] a casket a coffer her other receptacle
[36:05] in which valuables
[36:08] are kept
[36:10] you know you don't put and you know I've
[36:13] got a safe at home and pretty much all
[36:14] of you got a safe or something somewhere
[36:16] and and you go out and you buy
[36:20] um you buy this plastic Cutlery that's
[36:23] what we use at the hunting camp because
[36:24] we don't want to wash dishes I tell them
[36:26] I'll wash the plates and the knives and
[36:28] the forest because they're all plastic
[36:29] and I just throw them in the trash
[36:31] but that's us but anyway but
[36:35] brother Donnie I know you got one and a
[36:37] safe and do you have any of that in
[36:40] there are you put now you might want to
[36:42] put toilet paper in there the way it was
[36:43] the other a couple years ago but
[36:45] basically you're not going to put a
[36:47] plastic fork in a plastic knife you're
[36:49] not in other words you're not going to
[36:51] store that kind of treasure because it's
[36:53] not valuable it has no value
[36:56] and it's not something you want to
[36:57] protect
[36:59] we want to get rid of that
[37:01] we want to protect what's dear and
[37:04] valuable to us now listen when we were
[37:06] out in the world we did value other
[37:09] things
[37:10] but that value we put on them is what
[37:13] killed us
[37:14] this value that we're talking about here
[37:16] is going to save us
[37:18] look down there at number one see
[37:20] brother random had a vision about a what
[37:22] a storehouse
[37:25] a storehouse
[37:28] and you know what you can look at it as
[37:30] a storehouse of the building but I'm
[37:31] looking at me
[37:33] that inventory that he preached in 1100
[37:36] sermons you can put them in this
[37:38] building right here in tape form and and
[37:40] digital form and it will do nothing but
[37:43] just burn when the world's being burned
[37:45] over but once it comes inside of me and
[37:47] you there's your storehouse
[37:49] because you gather up your treasure
[37:51] Storehouse repository the things laid up
[37:55] in a treasury collected Treasures
[37:59] you know you come to church and you you
[38:01] say well I didn't get anything much but
[38:03] maybe later on if you keep meditating on
[38:05] God God will come to you and that thing
[38:07] will fit right together that's a
[38:09] treasure you hold on to you hold it
[38:11] listen if you've ever had a revelation
[38:12] it can't get away from me you might not
[38:14] remember the whole detail of it
[38:17] but you can tell that it changed you it
[38:19] made you read the Bible different it
[38:21] made you read you know when we were when
[38:24] we were in other churches
[38:26] maybe may I say and we we read about the
[38:29] Seed doctrine and we heard preachers
[38:31] preach about this and we heard preachers
[38:33] preach at Daniel 70 weeks it was only
[38:34] three and a half years left after the
[38:36] Rapture that they just read the Bible
[38:38] they'd understand us not
[38:40] but we what we stored that up
[38:44] as good food
[38:46] everybody with me we stored that up as
[38:49] good food people have stored up as good
[38:52] food that brother Brown's got to come
[38:53] back
[38:54] oh he'll come back all right
[38:56] he'll come back he'll ride this Trail
[38:58] again but you know what he's going to
[38:59] ride it on he's going to write it on
[39:01] mine and your faith
[39:03] to get him out of the ground
[39:07] so that's the way we got to think
[39:09] don't think Rapture think Resurrection
[39:12] they destroying death
[39:15] but that's what we got but we store
[39:16] these things up but what happened was we
[39:19] had a preacher come by Brother Dale
[39:20] started preaching we started listening
[39:22] to some of his tapes or or listening to
[39:24] the seals and different things you know
[39:25] that that these good ministers is
[39:27] preaching
[39:28] and then what do we do with that
[39:30] that's in our storehouse
[39:35] we tossed it out
[39:37] it wasn't good treasure anymore but but
[39:39] but but Jesus tell us right hello he
[39:41] said but we have this treasure
[39:44] this treasure what what treasure it go
[39:47] back and read
[39:48] has shined in our hearts to give the
[39:50] light of the knowledge of the glory of
[39:52] God in the face of Jesus Christ
[39:54] that's mine and your mandate when we
[39:56] become up to Statue of prayer or go up
[39:57] the statue of perfect man that's what it
[39:59] is it's the light of the knowledge of
[40:01] the glory of God it's not just that
[40:02] knowledge right there it's the knowledge
[40:04] of virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[40:06] godliness that you have a knowledge of
[40:08] it that you store it up and you know
[40:11] it's kind of like a hard drive it's in
[40:13] there and it's spinning around and you
[40:15] may not need this certain file but it's
[40:17] still there right
[40:19] but what happens is you click on that
[40:22] certain file and it pulls up that
[40:23] information then pull up everything
[40:25] pulls up that information and then it
[40:28] puts it on the screen for you to read it
[40:30] that's the same way God is
[40:32] you guys store it in there somewhere but
[40:34] listen you gotta hear it first
[40:37] you've got to hear it first you can't
[40:39] just come up with these ideas on your
[40:41] own
[40:45] brother Brown didn't come up with these
[40:46] ideas on his own he got them from the
[40:48] Bible
[40:49] all right so that's why I put my faith
[40:51] in what the Bible
[40:53] he didn't say face final resting places
[40:55] in brother Brown's message brother Brown
[40:56] said face final arrest in place of the
[40:58] word of God
[40:59] so I said you can take all these major
[41:01] doctrines and you've got to take it back
[41:03] to the Bible and brother around can't
[41:04] say anything any different than the
[41:06] Bible
[41:06] all right so you got to base it on the
[41:09] Bible what'd the Bible say 70 weeks are
[41:11] determined and he shall confirm the
[41:13] Covenant for one week who that's the
[41:15] Antichrist we're going to be gone so
[41:16] there's one week left you figure that
[41:18] out
[41:19] now you can't change the Bible
[41:21] you can't change the Bible to fit a
[41:23] quote you've got to change the quote fit
[41:24] the Bible
[41:25] am I with me
[41:28] that's that storing up that we've been
[41:30] struck listen somebody in this world is
[41:34] going to store up good food
[41:36] no rotten food at all good food and
[41:39] going to what that's going to sustain
[41:41] them to a resurrection
[41:43] sustain them to a body change it's going
[41:46] to sustain us because what we took these
[41:48] treasures and we've held them what in in
[41:51] steel and mortar it says Earth and
[41:53] vessels right here
[41:55] hey
[41:57] the Frailty of man
[41:59] because you can take a clay pot and you
[42:02] can just hit it just a little bit and
[42:03] what does it do it falls apart
[42:05] right
[42:06] it falls apart there's nothing to it but
[42:08] God decided to put it in an earth and
[42:11] vessel
[42:12] he decided to do that and use it
[42:18] which is what
[42:21] what and having your flesh not cursed
[42:23] like it used to not flesh but what their
[42:25] Outlet of your memories and constant
[42:28] affection to do the things you used to
[42:29] do
[42:30] things I used to do I do them no more
[42:34] but a storehouse a repository magazine
[42:37] that
[42:38] in the treasury
[42:42] you're collecting a treasure
[42:44] putting it in your storehouse
[42:49] and brother Brown said it was good food
[42:50] oh big apples and oranges and and big
[42:53] you know it wasn't just like he didn't
[42:55] walk in and division didn't have well I
[42:58] think that's a that box of cheese over
[43:00] in the corner
[43:01] that's one apple no he said it the thing
[43:04] was full yes of good food
[43:07] that's what this word is it's full of
[43:09] good food if we're what
[43:12] if we'll eat it
[43:14] everybody with me
[43:16] we got to get this down before we can
[43:18] head toward the son of man revelation we
[43:20] got to get this son of God Revelation
[43:21] we've got to have the virtues working in
[43:24] our life
[43:25] because that's what God's coming to okay
[43:27] and I didn't make it I didn't make that
[43:30] the rule God did
[43:32] so in the Statue perfect man brother
[43:33] Brown says as we've said many times
[43:35] before the first thing you got to do you
[43:36] got to be born again
[43:37] all right you gotta be born again now
[43:39] you get born again and what you've got
[43:41] to be changed
[43:44] okay
[43:46] and it's going to show on the outside
[43:48] eventually
[43:53] mom and dad
[43:55] years and years ago brother Mike aulti
[43:58] came to the church here and of course
[43:59] when it was a little building
[44:01] my mama said I'm sure Sister Janet won't
[44:04] mind if I tell it said she said she had
[44:06] her hair was cut off as short as a as a
[44:08] man's and had big old earrings you know
[44:10] in a short dress and potato just come
[44:12] into the message
[44:13] well what you do is though you look at
[44:15] her a month later and here she's dressed
[44:17] you don't brother Brown's you know he
[44:19] talks about hair he said if you're a
[44:20] born-again Believer your hair is just as
[44:22] long as somebody that's never cut their
[44:24] hair it's just got to keep growing out
[44:25] it's just something that you've got to
[44:27] do
[44:28] right with your flesh
[44:30] so that listen I told the girl that
[44:33] that's right beside of us and she's a
[44:35] hairdresser
[44:37] I said Jenny I said if people live by
[44:40] the Bible you'd go out of business
[44:44] you cut some men's hair but you'd never
[44:46] cut a wall and she just kind of looked
[44:47] at me like that you know and I said no
[44:49] I said you know it in the Bible you're
[44:51] sitting there with short hair you know
[44:53] it in the Bible it's in the Bible not to
[44:55] cut the hair but you sit there and cut
[44:56] their hair and I mean day in and day out
[44:59] 10 and 15 people a day mostly women
[45:02] and what is it common for this world to
[45:05] do cut their hair right
[45:07] it's just common I mean it's just you're
[45:09] weird if you don't
[45:14] don't know they're weird
[45:16] because they're not doing what the Bible
[45:18] says
[45:19] so beloved when I gave all diligence to
[45:22] write unto you the common salvation
[45:23] common salvation in other words
[45:26] foundational truth
[45:28] all right
[45:30] common salvation it was needful for me
[45:33] to write unto you this is Jude writing
[45:36] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[45:38] contend for the faith which was once
[45:40] delivered unto the Saints he could look
[45:42] back and see Peter James uh John the
[45:46] different ones the founders the the the
[45:48] Cornerstone of the church there they
[45:51] were they had these gifts working in
[45:54] their life and Jews going
[45:55] in other words let's put in 2020 Jude
[45:59] walks into a message church and there's
[46:00] no gifts working
[46:02] people are living any way they want to
[46:05] there's no virtue knowledge Temperance
[46:07] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[46:10] Jesus like come on man y'all missed
[46:11] something somewhere
[46:13] he said but you need to earnestly
[46:15] contend to get back to that
[46:18] earnestly contend for the faith which
[46:21] was once delivered so listen that faith
[46:23] is here
[46:25] because if it was once delivered to the
[46:27] Saints God don't change
[46:29] whatever he requires of them that's what
[46:31] he requires of us
[46:33] God word down to the church ages through
[46:36] partial revelation
[46:38] but when you get to Peter James and all
[46:39] them and Paul
[46:41] not one thing Paul said was wrong
[46:45] come on somebody not one thing Paul
[46:47] priest was wrong why can't we get to
[46:49] that
[46:51] nothing he preached was wrong
[46:53] I'll read to you in just a minute
[46:55] remember Phyllis and hymenius
[46:57] he called her name in the Bible Philip
[47:00] said I mean is he said they're preaching
[47:01] at the resurrections already took place
[47:04] all right
[47:06] and you know where they got it from Paul
[47:09] Paul was the Paul was the prophet of the
[47:11] day
[47:13] so I don't I don't think it's so strange
[47:15] brother Donnie that people around here
[47:17] today not here around the message doing
[47:19] the same thing
[47:21] well brother Brown said well Paul said
[47:23] there's already been a resurrection he
[47:25] was talking about an out Resurrection
[47:26] he's talking about an inside
[47:27] Resurrection but Phillips and hymenius
[47:30] go to their church at their little I'm
[47:33] not going there
[47:35] their little camp
[47:38] the little group that they huddle all up
[47:40] in and they're preaching Paul's message
[47:42] but preaching it wrong
[47:46] you should earnestly contend for the
[47:48] faith which was once delivered unto the
[47:49] Saints for there are certain men
[47:53] not man man preachers
[47:59] for there are certain men crept in
[48:01] unawares
[48:03] now unawares means they didn't know they
[48:05] was in the congregation yet
[48:07] come on somebody
[48:09] who were before of old ordained to this
[48:12] condemnation
[48:14] ungodly men turn in the grace of our
[48:17] Lord into lasciviousness which is
[48:19] horrible
[48:21] and denying the only Lord God and our
[48:23] Lord
[48:24] Jesus Christ but thank God he gave us
[48:26] Ephesians 4 11 he gave us a perfect
[48:28] fivefold ministry that could take us on
[48:31] that could get us out of what our
[48:33] indifferent or our differences and
[48:36] indifferences
[48:39] and get us what get us up this statue of
[48:41] perfect man get us to that Son of God
[48:43] Revelation to where listen folks
[48:47] it ought to be
[48:48] to be a Christian why you want to be a
[48:50] Christian and just
[48:51] be that
[48:53] is there not a desire in your heart when
[48:55] when when you've got a dad
[49:00] and I'm included in this
[49:02] you got a dad that's sitting at home
[49:04] that's sick as a dog hundred and
[49:05] something degrees fever and can't hardly
[49:07] think and can't hardly get out of a
[49:09] chair
[49:10] and there I am
[49:14] supposedly a born-again believer that
[49:16] has the power to pray for the sick
[49:19] and to see demons cast out of people
[49:22] and to see chains loose from people's
[49:24] life
[49:25] and to see the sick healed the dead
[49:27] raised that's what happened in the first
[49:29] church age
[49:31] Silver and Gold Have I None
[49:33] but such as a house
[49:36] and even they believed them so much that
[49:38] they said
[49:39] if just if I just get into shadow of
[49:41] Paul
[49:42] if I just get in the shadow of Peter
[49:45] they're so Godly
[49:47] told it just what that virtue just oozes
[49:50] out of them and I don't know if that's a
[49:51] good word to use but I think it's a good
[49:52] word to use it just oozes out of you
[49:56] overflow
[49:59] that's the kind of thing I want folks
[50:00] that's what I want now listen we can't
[50:02] conquer the world but I'll guarantee
[50:04] there's got to be some time when the
[50:05] devil's got to back off
[50:07] to the people of God
[50:10] there's a time and a place but it's got
[50:12] to be a time and a place where we can
[50:13] believe that and not have all these
[50:15] other things in our head going well I
[50:17] don't know if I need to pray for him or
[50:18] not
[50:20] Heavenly days you're a Christian
[50:23] lay hands on the sick they shall recover
[50:25] it doesn't matter if a woman's got bob
[50:27] hair or no hair
[50:30] human beings are sick this whole world's
[50:32] sick I'm not talking about just mentally
[50:34] physically this whole world's sick
[50:36] covet's coming back around again
[50:45] the greatest weapon that I know of a
[50:48] Christian today is a committal
[50:51] to the world
[50:54] oh that doesn't say that
[50:56] is a committal to God
[51:02] the greatest weapon that I know of a
[51:04] Christian today
[51:06] is a committal to God when you can't do
[51:08] nothing about it just commit it to him
[51:10] and God will take care of him
[51:13] now we know the greatest battle ever
[51:15] fought we know that I believe that the
[51:16] greatest battle that was ever fought is
[51:18] now ready to go into action I believe
[51:20] that God has been selecting his soldiers
[51:22] I believe that I believe he's been
[51:24] dressing them and training them that's
[51:26] why I took us 60 years
[51:28] to get this message right
[51:31] I said not get the message right get us
[51:34] right in the message let's put it that
[51:36] way this message has been right since
[51:37] the foundation of the world
[51:40] actually before the foundation of the
[51:42] world
[51:42] do you all understand this this message
[51:44] is not
[51:51] in the 1100 sermons and we hear we hear
[51:54] the voice of God
[51:56] speaking to us that's what our mandate
[51:59] is is to listen to the voice of God not
[52:01] a voice
[52:04] he's been selecting them he's been
[52:06] dressing them training them
[52:09] and the Battlefront is now set getting
[52:11] ready to start that was 1962.
[52:15] you know what that one that was 311. the
[52:19] seals were preached in that same month
[52:22] a year later
[52:25] brother Brown a year later comes back in
[52:27] March and preaches the seals comes from
[52:29] the greatest battle ever fought he knew
[52:31] it was going to be a fight
[52:32] he knew it was going to be a struggle
[52:34] what'd he say he said it's gone from you
[52:37] it's not for you
[52:38] preaching marriage in divorce he said
[52:40] thousands of my friends are going to
[52:42] turn me down
[52:43] and they did
[52:45] why because he wasn't the normal
[52:48] oh you can do what you want to it's okay
[52:52] no
[52:54] the greatest battle
[52:55] the Battleground begins in the human
[52:57] mind
[52:59] there is where the battle starts the
[53:01] human mind was chosen for the place of
[53:04] battle where it was begin and that is
[53:07] because that decisions are made from the
[53:09] mind or the head your decision
[53:13] that's your filter
[53:16] all right even if you got the Holy Ghost
[53:18] listen even with the Holy Ghost you're
[53:19] gonna make mistakes
[53:21] I hope you all understand that I hope
[53:23] you don't think that you know you see
[53:25] these commercials where the where they
[53:27] they're getting ready to put on some uh
[53:29] uh some real pretty cologne or or some
[53:32] real pretty washing powders and
[53:33] everything smells good so butterflies go
[53:36] off all over the place and Sun Shines
[53:38] everywhere and you know you got a
[53:39] rainbow in the cloud you know and you're
[53:41] going oh this is so good I need you to
[53:44] fall back in the cloud that's not going
[53:46] to happen
[53:49] yeah
[53:51] it's going to be more like a war zone
[53:55] than it is a flowery bed of ease isn't
[53:58] that what the Bible says you know it's
[53:59] not going to be a flower bed of ease
[54:03] but listen if you're committed to God
[54:06] the committal committed to God
[54:08] and let him do the work
[54:11] unless we suffer it with him we can't
[54:13] reign with him you have to suffer to
[54:14] rain the reason this is that character
[54:16] simply is never
[54:17] made without suffering what did I just
[54:19] say character is a victory not a gift
[54:23] so that what that's the characteristics
[54:25] of God so it was what even Jesus learned
[54:29] by the things that he want
[54:31] suffered
[54:32] and being made perfect
[54:35] became the author of Salvation to all of
[54:37] us
[54:39] see that's hard to swallow because you
[54:40] think well he was lost no he wasn't lost
[54:43] he was a human
[54:45] he had a human brain just like you did
[54:47] he had a human psyche just like you do
[54:50] the devil talked to him as much as God
[54:52] did
[54:54] come on
[54:56] the devil was actually closer he took
[54:58] him up on a building
[55:00] took him out in the desert
[55:02] took him up on a high place and said
[55:04] here's a vision of the whole world it's
[55:06] yours if you'll worship me
[55:09] no you have to suffer the rain character
[55:11] is a victory not a gift a man without
[55:13] character can't Reign because power
[55:14] apart from character is satanic but
[55:18] Power with character
[55:20] is fit to rule you think boy see real
[55:23] real boy that's real real no real over
[55:26] yourself
[55:28] rule over you
[55:30] start with that husband start with that
[55:32] wives rule over yourself
[55:35] and that will help rule over your
[55:37] children
[55:38] why am I against organized religion
[55:40] brother Brown said look
[55:42] if what is purpose to the church the
[55:44] life that was in Christ isn't reflecting
[55:46] in you don't you stand still if you
[55:48] haven't got patience virtue and all
[55:50] these things Temperance things and
[55:51] godliness brother kindness and all these
[55:53] things that's required of you
[55:56] it's a requirement
[55:58] Lauren was telling me good to have
[55:59] Lauren back with us it was good Lauren
[56:01] said she was going to be take this
[56:03] course of Criminal Justice and she's
[56:04] like some Court you got it's a
[56:06] requirement are you just gonna you're
[56:07] gonna take like chalk growing
[56:10] you know kids on the sidewalk they take
[56:11] chalk ninja that's not part of the
[56:13] curriculum right no that's not required
[56:17] that may be an elective but it's not a
[56:19] required course a required course has to
[56:21] do with the subject matter that you're
[56:23] studying right
[56:25] time I was here
[56:28] these things are required of us
[56:31] they're required of us to be like Peter
[56:33] James and Paul you say okay Paul I can
[56:35] well see there
[56:37] then you can't
[56:39] because it's all in your head
[56:43] it's all in your head
[56:45] listen to this James 1 verse 6.
[56:48] but let him ask in faith nothing
[56:50] wavering for he that waivers is like a
[56:52] wave of the seed driven with the wind
[56:54] and toss
[56:56] one of the best sermons brother Brown
[56:57] preaching his early Ministry was why are
[56:59] some people tossed about man that was in
[57:02] the early 50s and he laid it out he told
[57:05] them why they were tossed about they
[57:07] wasn't born again
[57:10] for let not that man think that he shall
[57:12] receive anything of the Lord because a
[57:14] double-minded man is unstable in some of
[57:17] his ways
[57:18] it says all his ways
[57:23] and that word means wavering uncertain
[57:26] doubting
[57:27] divided in interest I don't know if I
[57:29] can go to church or not I I think my
[57:31] cat's got diarrhea whoever somebody ever
[57:33] said that before
[57:34] you know I mean you got all these
[57:36] excuses that's okay it's all right
[57:39] listen I want to tell you something
[57:40] about that you know because
[57:44] if you're out and you're going on
[57:45] vacation I'm not talking about people
[57:47] like that you know brother Dale's never
[57:48] said that either
[57:50] but when you just don't come to church
[57:52] you're lost
[57:54] when you just don't come you have no
[57:56] excuse and you just or you have a bunch
[57:58] of them
[57:59] you know you're lost but but now if you
[58:02] take a vacation or like I was gone last
[58:04] week different things that's all right
[58:06] but that's 52 weeks out of the year if
[58:08] you're gone 50 of them
[58:10] you're lost
[58:13] take a couple of weeks of vacation go
[58:15] off somewhere be with your husband and
[58:17] wife or wife be with your family
[58:19] take some time off
[58:23] when I was not doing anything Sunday I
[58:26] was watching the service here
[58:29] amen so so it's a desire that you have
[58:31] in your heart go take time off be be
[58:33] with your family be but don't say well
[58:36] my family's coming in next weekend I
[58:38] think I'll be with them and then they
[58:40] come in the next weekend and you got
[58:41] three brothers and they're all going to
[58:42] come in separate weekends or we don't
[58:44] see you for three months that's what I'm
[58:46] talking about
[58:49] or your job has just takes you all year
[58:52] and you're going to be out the whole
[58:54] year you know
[58:56] if you're out for your job that's okay
[58:58] once or twice
[59:00] but when you use it as an excuse to be
[59:02] out you're the only one that knows how
[59:04] you're the only one that knows whether
[59:06] you need to be in church or not so it's
[59:08] not up to the preacher
[59:10] it's up to you
[59:13] I'm fulfilling the word of God
[59:15] I'm telling you about it
[59:19] but the right mental attitude
[59:22] the right mental attitude
[59:24] 1951 a prophet of God
[59:28] your right mental attitude toward God's
[59:30] Divine promise will bring any promise
[59:33] to pass any promise
[59:36] you know what we we take that we take
[59:38] that I believe and we put it toward
[59:41] healing
[59:42] what about salvation
[59:44] the right mental attitude God I'm lost
[59:48] I'm lost I'm I'm tormented I don't know
[59:52] what to do
[59:55] right mental attitude
[59:58] start making an effort read your Bible
[1:00:00] instead of reading whatever you read
[1:00:02] before remember brother Brown he said if
[1:00:04] you're standing you start giving stuff
[1:00:05] away do the vice versa now the prophet
[1:00:07] of God told us that
[1:00:09] ever how Elementary you think that is he
[1:00:11] he must thought it worked because God
[1:00:13] had him say it to us
[1:00:16] that it's not some great something you
[1:00:17] got to do no it's the power of the right
[1:00:20] mental attitude and listen this is not
[1:00:23] this is not the power of positive
[1:00:25] thinking
[1:00:27] that's a whole different they wrote
[1:00:28] books about that and and you know you
[1:00:30] can have that if you want to but the
[1:00:33] most positive thing I know of is the
[1:00:35] word of God
[1:00:36] so if we think on these things
[1:00:39] then we do need to think on these things
[1:00:41] and have the right mental attitude that
[1:00:44] when you come to church you go get
[1:00:45] something from God
[1:00:47] I mean really do we come to church and
[1:00:49] say God
[1:00:51] I need x y z be specific
[1:00:55] I need healing I got a question about my
[1:00:58] life I got a question about my job I got
[1:01:01] a question about a boyfriend or a
[1:01:03] girlfriend I've got a question about
[1:01:05] what kind of car to drive or buy I got a
[1:01:08] question whether to buy a new house or
[1:01:09] or rent there's questions and you say
[1:01:12] well boy you gonna make God real busy he
[1:01:14] ain't never been too busy
[1:01:16] to answer every question that you got
[1:01:18] but you know what if you'll listen to it
[1:01:22] and you know what you got to ask the
[1:01:23] question
[1:01:26] now look now maybe you don't believe
[1:01:28] that brother but I'm saying hello you
[1:01:30] say well my faith is weak I wouldn't
[1:01:32] confess it
[1:01:34] don't let the devil know that always say
[1:01:37] I've got good faith
[1:01:39] and I know that's hard to do when you
[1:01:41] have temperatures 103 and you're laying
[1:01:42] in the bed or you throwing your guts up
[1:01:44] it's hard to believe that but you know
[1:01:45] what you got to just keep saying that
[1:01:48] just keep saying it
[1:01:50] just keep saying it just keep saying
[1:01:52] Thank You Lord just keep saying thank
[1:01:53] you for my healing just say Lord I know
[1:01:55] people are praying for me it's out on
[1:01:58] the you know on the internet and and I
[1:02:00] thank God for that because for that part
[1:02:02] of it because real quickly we know if
[1:02:05] somebody's sick or if somebody's been in
[1:02:06] a hospital we know it real quick and we
[1:02:08] can pray right then take that situation
[1:02:11] to the Lord right there all right and
[1:02:13] take it to him right then fresh right
[1:02:15] there because you know who's you know
[1:02:16] who's the fresher than you are the devil
[1:02:18] is because he's the one that put it on
[1:02:19] them
[1:02:20] hey man somebody
[1:02:22] so we want God to get there with we want
[1:02:25] the prayer angels to be there we want
[1:02:27] them to drive all that out
[1:02:29] that's what they did in the in Peter and
[1:02:31] James and John and all that they didn't
[1:02:32] have this denominational thing they had
[1:02:35] to worry about of a different idea that
[1:02:38] God's this and God's that and and you
[1:02:40] know brother I meant this and he was
[1:02:43] wrong here they didn't have that
[1:02:47] Peter stands up one day and he says
[1:02:49] you've crucified the Lord of Glory
[1:02:52] it's your fault
[1:02:55] right
[1:02:56] read the book of eyes he stands up and
[1:02:58] he says this Jesus whom you've killed
[1:03:02] whom you crucified
[1:03:05] God has made him both Lord and Christ in
[1:03:07] other words now he was inside of Peter
[1:03:09] and then 3 000 people were so pricked at
[1:03:13] their heart they said hey how can we get
[1:03:14] what you got
[1:03:16] right how can we you've told us a little
[1:03:18] bit about this Jesus we want to know
[1:03:19] some more about him
[1:03:22] and then you know who got in trouble
[1:03:24] Pearl Stephen got in trouble
[1:03:27] he preached a wonderful sermon about all
[1:03:29] the way took him from Moses you know
[1:03:31] them big sent hadron they just sitting
[1:03:32] there going we know all that we know
[1:03:35] about Moses we know about the Red Sea
[1:03:40] but oh when Stephen
[1:03:43] got to Jesus
[1:03:46] and he said you crucified him
[1:03:48] you destroyed him
[1:03:50] it's your fault that's when they took
[1:03:53] him out and stoned him when he told him
[1:03:55] about Jesus
[1:03:58] have you ever been stoned because of
[1:03:59] what you believe
[1:04:01] think about that
[1:04:03] but I wouldn't confess it don't let the
[1:04:05] devil know it I always say I got good
[1:04:07] faith I believe God with all my heart
[1:04:09] don't testify nothing of the devil Queen
[1:04:11] of Sheba 1961 let's hurry through this I
[1:04:14] want to get to a point the first thing I
[1:04:16] want to find out whether it's the will
[1:04:17] of God this is what we were talking
[1:04:18] about the other day I've thought it
[1:04:19] worthy to read it again
[1:04:22] if you have a situation this is how
[1:04:24] brother Brown I'm the prophet of God
[1:04:25] handled his situations all right nobody
[1:04:27] with me all right the first thing I want
[1:04:30] to find out is whether it's the will of
[1:04:31] God or not
[1:04:33] anybody with me right there that's the
[1:04:35] first thing if it's not the will of God
[1:04:37] don't go to the next two
[1:04:40] because it's going to be your motive and
[1:04:42] your objective
[1:04:45] but if this was the will of God it just
[1:04:47] might fit in the plan of God
[1:04:49] but it ain't gonna fit in the plan of
[1:04:51] God if you start off wrong
[1:04:53] the next thing is my objective to it and
[1:04:56] my motive in doing it then if it's the
[1:04:59] will of God and my objective is right
[1:05:01] and my motive is right I have faith that
[1:05:04] it'll be done
[1:05:06] because first it's the will of God
[1:05:08] and my objective is to glorify him what
[1:05:11] with what he's trying to ever whatever
[1:05:13] he's trying to do is to glorify God not
[1:05:16] to glorify himself and my motive is to
[1:05:18] give him all the glory see there's no
[1:05:20] selfish motive about it if you have a
[1:05:22] selfish motive it won't work
[1:05:25] if your objective is to make money for
[1:05:27] yourself or something well you'll never
[1:05:28] succeed and then try to do something
[1:05:31] outside the will of God it's not going
[1:05:33] to work to begin with
[1:05:38] 1963 read this
[1:05:40] and I go on record I say this about the
[1:05:42] word of God being a seed if you can take
[1:05:45] the right mental attitude toward any
[1:05:47] Divine promise of God he will bring it
[1:05:51] to pass if you can get yourself in
[1:05:53] position
[1:05:55] to believe that that promise
[1:05:58] was to you
[1:06:00] not to your neighbor
[1:06:02] not to the ones that once had the faith
[1:06:05] according to Jude no and now Faith as
[1:06:09] brother uh Grand priests at one time now
[1:06:11] Faith is a substance of things now we
[1:06:14] need in our faith
[1:06:16] listen you should you should not have
[1:06:20] faith
[1:06:22] that God's won
[1:06:26] you should be passed out
[1:06:28] that should be so solidified in your
[1:06:30] soul that you don't wonder about that
[1:06:33] because you know what if you wonder
[1:06:34] about something you don't have faith
[1:06:38] well I'm glad y'all got quiet
[1:06:40] you think about that
[1:06:43] if you have a doubt about something how
[1:06:45] can it be faith
[1:06:47] that amen it can't be if you haven't
[1:06:50] well I don't know about that maybe there
[1:06:51] is two or three here or because people
[1:06:54] listen people fight you over Trinity
[1:06:58] because that's what they want that's
[1:07:00] what they built their treasure on that's
[1:07:02] what they put in their Storehouse that
[1:07:04] they think God's Gonna honor that but
[1:07:06] God cannot honor false word
[1:07:09] never can and never will he can wink at
[1:07:12] your ignorance for a Time
[1:07:15] but remember what I said about ignorance
[1:07:16] it's not wrong to be ignorant
[1:07:19] but if you stay ignorant long enough it
[1:07:21] comes to stupid
[1:07:22] and when he gets to stupid you're in
[1:07:24] trouble
[1:07:25] all right
[1:07:27] because ignorant would be I don't have
[1:07:28] one clue about criminal justice and
[1:07:30] Lauren's just got a head full of it over
[1:07:32] there
[1:07:34] but if I say well I want to be a
[1:07:35] criminal justice guy myself I'm just
[1:07:38] going to walk into court instead of
[1:07:39] hearing oh yeah well she's going
[1:07:43] it ain't gonna happen is it
[1:07:46] you know I don't think so she said
[1:07:48] so what do you got to have you got to
[1:07:50] have the right curriculum you got to
[1:07:52] have the right what motive and objective
[1:07:54] you got to have what the backing of God
[1:07:57] and then that'll happen he's going to
[1:08:00] equip you for the battle I want to read
[1:08:02] this right here we haven't read this
[1:08:03] before a second Corinthians 10 verse 3.
[1:08:05] for though we walk into flesh we do not
[1:08:08] war
[1:08:10] after the flesh I'm reading Paul
[1:08:13] because if you stop right here it will
[1:08:16] seem contrary to what Paul's been
[1:08:18] talking about but he continues on here
[1:08:20] in parentheses for the weapons of our
[1:08:22] Warfare
[1:08:24] not the weapons of our picnic
[1:08:27] the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:08:29] carnal
[1:08:31] But Mighty through God to the pulling
[1:08:34] down of strongholds every one of us has
[1:08:36] got a strong part in our body in our
[1:08:38] psyche that we need to get tore down
[1:08:41] every one of us has something that
[1:08:43] it stops US
[1:08:45] so there's weapons of our Warfare that
[1:08:49] are not carnal they're spiritual and
[1:08:51] they pull down those strongholds and
[1:08:53] that's what I'm trying to get us to do
[1:08:54] pull those strongholds down let God do
[1:08:57] it in your life let him pull them down
[1:08:59] because you know what when they pull
[1:09:01] down a wall
[1:09:02] Jericho they would stand up on that wall
[1:09:05] of Jericho and they'd go this wall is 14
[1:09:08] feet thick we run chariot races around
[1:09:11] this thing and y'all I can't even see
[1:09:14] you down there what do you mean you're
[1:09:15] gonna destroy this wall
[1:09:18] what do you mean you're gonna destroy my
[1:09:20] city of Jericho
[1:09:22] we got walls to think you can't even you
[1:09:25] couldn't borrow your way through it
[1:09:28] and what happened
[1:09:31] God showed them
[1:09:33] that their defenses were not brick and
[1:09:35] mortar
[1:09:36] it was a bunch of Earth and vessels
[1:09:38] standing outside that was the chosen
[1:09:40] people of God
[1:09:42] and they hollered and screamed and
[1:09:44] shouted Victory and the walls fell down
[1:09:48] so man so see Joshua and them didn't
[1:09:49] have to have the battering rams and they
[1:09:51] didn't have to go get the climbing gear
[1:09:54] and they didn't have to go one piece at
[1:09:56] a time no they just said God said hey if
[1:09:58] you'll do this then things will fall
[1:10:01] same way with us folks
[1:10:03] so how's this going to happen here we go
[1:10:06] right here casting down imaginations
[1:10:09] memory reason conscious affection
[1:10:12] imagination
[1:10:14] that's part of our five senses in this
[1:10:16] in their in the spirit realm right
[1:10:19] casting down imaginations well I imagine
[1:10:22] I wonder what uh God has never set one
[1:10:26] day and said I wonder how it's going to
[1:10:28] happen if I do it this way
[1:10:29] he knew it was going to happen
[1:10:32] you say well I can't that we're not God
[1:10:34] what you got God in you
[1:10:38] well maybe some of you do and some of
[1:10:40] you don't
[1:10:41] casting down imagination and look and
[1:10:44] every High thing that exalted itself
[1:10:46] against the knowledge of God now look
[1:10:48] I've yet the knowledge of God
[1:10:50] there's going to be competition or
[1:10:52] there's going to be someone always
[1:10:55] Paul always had an adversary
[1:10:58] Demas
[1:10:59] phyllitus and Armenia seven sons of
[1:11:02] skiva the the woman sorcerer the
[1:11:05] coppersmith he always had somebody that
[1:11:09] was following along and and and trying
[1:11:12] to mess up his his campaign in other
[1:11:14] words so you're gonna have them too
[1:11:16] you're them they're probably not
[1:11:18] Villages and armenius but they may be
[1:11:20] whatever you want to call them
[1:11:21] but cast down that imagination and every
[1:11:24] High thing that is often itself against
[1:11:26] the knowledge of God look and bringing
[1:11:28] into captivity
[1:11:32] every thought to The Obedience of Christ
[1:11:41] the power of your thought
[1:11:43] think on these things
[1:11:46] look and having in a readiness
[1:11:51] not having to go find it
[1:11:53] not having to call the pastor I know
[1:11:56] there's times we have to call others to
[1:11:58] get to get help and power and and to
[1:12:01] talk about things but you need to start
[1:12:02] standing on your own two feet I believe
[1:12:04] brother Dale's taught us enough that we
[1:12:06] don't have to come crying to the pastor
[1:12:08] all the time well handle it yourself
[1:12:11] and having in a Readiness to Revenge all
[1:12:14] day
[1:12:18] here's the key
[1:12:20] when your obedience is fulfilled
[1:12:22] because if you're disobedient how can
[1:12:25] you cast out something that's
[1:12:26] disobedient
[1:12:29] foreign
[1:12:33] prophet of God
[1:12:35] I would say the most obedient person
[1:12:37] since Christ Jesus on the face of the
[1:12:39] Earth would you not say that
[1:12:41] he tells a little white lie
[1:12:45] actually tells the truth
[1:12:47] but he said it was a little while
[1:12:48] afterwards he said tell him I'm not here
[1:12:51] run outside
[1:12:52] no what happened when he went he had a
[1:12:55] leading to go pray for that child right
[1:12:58] come pray for our brother I'm a sick you
[1:12:59] know okay I'll be there in a second
[1:13:01] he gets over to the house what does he
[1:13:03] do gets ready to put his hands on the
[1:13:05] baby and God says take your dirty hands
[1:13:08] off that child
[1:13:12] how can you Revenge all Disobedience
[1:13:14] when your obedience is not fulfilled
[1:13:18] so what did he do he went back and made
[1:13:21] it right
[1:13:22] then he come and prayed and what did God
[1:13:24] do his obedience was fulfilled so then
[1:13:27] God honored what he said
[1:13:32] that's why I tell you
[1:13:34] when I don't pray for people
[1:13:37] well I used to sit over there but sit
[1:13:38] over here now but when I used to sit
[1:13:40] right there I'd raised my hand and I
[1:13:41] said God don't let me
[1:13:45] because the preacher is praying he's
[1:13:46] praying the prayer he's connected with
[1:13:48] him right
[1:13:49] the anointing's there
[1:13:51] and all of us need to be praying but
[1:13:53] brother Brown said if one unconfessed
[1:13:55] sin in the congregation can make what
[1:13:58] the whole congregation fell it can keep
[1:14:00] somebody from getting their healing
[1:14:02] so I say God
[1:14:05] you got a brother praying
[1:14:07] I don't need to know what it is and I'm
[1:14:09] not going to diligently pray for what
[1:14:11] they're praying for you say well boy
[1:14:13] that's kind of strange no you better
[1:14:15] make sure you're right first
[1:14:17] so I say God if there's anything in my
[1:14:19] heart
[1:14:20] anything I did against you or anybody
[1:14:22] else please forgive me so that I won't
[1:14:25] hinder that person getting their healing
[1:14:28] when your obedience is fulfilled
[1:14:31] having in Readiness to Revenge all
[1:14:34] Disobedience when your obedience
[1:14:38] fulfilled I like that
[1:14:42] that's why we should pray before we come
[1:14:44] to church
[1:14:45] why we should pray before we come in the
[1:14:46] door that's why we have a time of prayer
[1:14:50] or are you thinking about tomorrow's
[1:14:52] work are you thinking about something
[1:14:53] else
[1:14:57] there's your hindrance
[1:14:59] that we're not getting what we should be
[1:15:01] getting
[1:15:02] and I've done it too we all have
[1:15:05] but come in the Bible says having a pure
[1:15:06] mind
[1:15:08] but a renewing of your mind I know what
[1:15:11] in the world we get all muddled up when
[1:15:13] when you're not out of church I don't
[1:15:14] know about y'all but if I miss a service
[1:15:17] I don't feel good
[1:15:19] one service I just don't feel good and I
[1:15:21] don't feel it's like brother Louise was
[1:15:22] saying in the back then mind if I tell
[1:15:24] it's just not the same without me it's
[1:15:25] not the same without brother now it's
[1:15:27] not the same when we're when some of the
[1:15:29] pieces of the puzzle are missing
[1:15:31] it's just not the same
[1:15:33] but boy when you get them all together
[1:15:36] it's a powerful Army
[1:15:39] second Peter says this we'll close right
[1:15:41] here
[1:15:43] he says according to his divine power
[1:15:45] has given unto us all things that
[1:15:46] perceive unto life and Godless we're
[1:15:48] going to start into the virtues starting
[1:15:50] on next Sunday through the knowledge of
[1:15:53] him that hath called us to glory and
[1:15:55] virtue whereby our given unto us
[1:15:57] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:15:59] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:16:02] the divine nature having escaped
[1:16:07] stronghold's been pulled down hey
[1:16:09] I promise you one thing if you've been
[1:16:11] behind bars all your life
[1:16:13] and somebody walks in and smashes the
[1:16:15] wall of the prison down
[1:16:17] you're going to go well I think I'll
[1:16:19] just stay right here
[1:16:20] oh I kind of like it here I like this
[1:16:23] slop that they feed me in this bed that
[1:16:24] you know and I tore that over in the
[1:16:26] corner I love it I just absolutely love
[1:16:29] it that's what we
[1:16:33] I think I like that I think I'll keep it
[1:16:35] now when God pulls the wall down walk
[1:16:37] out
[1:16:38] don't walk out run out
[1:16:40] right having escaped the corruption that
[1:16:44] is in the world through lust and besides
[1:16:46] this so we've got something besides this
[1:16:50] because Peter on the day of Pentecost
[1:16:52] got the Holy Ghost
[1:16:55] but he had it besides this moment
[1:16:58] when he was at the gate beautiful and he
[1:16:59] said Silver and Gold Have I None but
[1:17:01] such as I have give unto thee in the
[1:17:03] name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk
[1:17:06] that was his besides this moment you and
[1:17:09] I start needing to have besides this
[1:17:11] moment listen we're Christians we do the
[1:17:13] right thing it's like wait a minute
[1:17:17] when your obedience is fulfilled
[1:17:19] God's going to give you
[1:17:21] the desire of your heart
[1:17:25] and this is how to do it and besides
[1:17:27] this giving all diligence or haste or
[1:17:29] earnestness
[1:17:31] earnestness and accomplishing or
[1:17:32] striving after anything interested in
[1:17:34] oneself self most earnestly
[1:17:37] add to your faith so we're adding now
[1:17:40] that faith that was there was a faith
[1:17:43] once delivered to the Saints well it
[1:17:45] took a prophet of God in the end time to
[1:17:48] what tie up the Loose Ends
[1:17:51] what was the Loose Ends the doctrines
[1:17:54] that had accumulated
[1:17:56] by the devil
[1:17:59] through the church
[1:18:01] through the bride
[1:18:03] hello somebody
[1:18:06] I'd
[1:18:08] but God said I can't take that no more
[1:18:11] because these people are going to have
[1:18:13] to be me
[1:18:16] come back in flesh again
[1:18:19] and if I didn't have a false Doctrine
[1:18:21] they can't have a false doctor
[1:18:25] so Baptist you can't have it
[1:18:28] because you got a trinitarian doctrine
[1:18:31] that I can't I can't I can wink at it I
[1:18:34] can save you
[1:18:35] come on somebody I can save you but I
[1:18:38] can't make you a adopted son and
[1:18:41] daughter of God because you have power
[1:18:43] without character
[1:18:47] but Power with character
[1:18:50] it's fit to change the body it's fat to
[1:18:52] bring the dead Saints out of the ground
[1:18:54] that's what the difference is
[1:18:58] God winked at them because he knew the
[1:19:00] devil was going to get in and didn't God
[1:19:03] write the Bible
[1:19:05] he's the one that said you've left your
[1:19:07] first love
[1:19:08] he's the one that said you took on a
[1:19:10] name that's not mine
[1:19:11] he's the one that said spoke there in
[1:19:13] Revelations remember that's the only
[1:19:15] book that Jesus spoke directly to Peter
[1:19:18] I mean to John right
[1:19:20] he was telling John this is what my
[1:19:22] church is going to look like
[1:19:25] and then he comes to a prophet in the
[1:19:27] end time and he shows him a vision
[1:19:30] of the most horrible Church in the world
[1:19:32] but it was a church
[1:19:35] half naked twisting right
[1:19:38] he said oh my God is this what my
[1:19:40] message has brought
[1:19:41] but then remember the preview of the
[1:19:44] Bride
[1:19:45] which she walked right
[1:19:47] she talked right she dressed right and
[1:19:50] she didn't go down she went up
[1:19:54] amen so we got to add to our faith
[1:19:56] virtue and diverse your knowledge
[1:19:59] that word admin means Minister
[1:20:02] nourishment we talked about this a few
[1:20:04] weeks ago
[1:20:05] Minister nourishment
[1:20:08] listen we'll read this and we'll close
[1:20:10] musicians come on a person of virtue
[1:20:12] makes a progression from knowing what is
[1:20:14] right to doing what is right
[1:20:16] we don't need a lot of knowers
[1:20:19] we need a lot of doers
[1:20:22] he or she intentionally chooses what to
[1:20:25] say to him value reaching beyond the
[1:20:26] good toward the best in every situation
[1:20:30] a virtuous person knows that they have
[1:20:32] an opportunity to honor the Lord and
[1:20:34] reflect him to others that should be our
[1:20:37] desire why don't we come to church for
[1:20:38] just see each other
[1:20:40] see what the next person is going to
[1:20:41] wear see if we who we can talk about
[1:20:45] second Timothy 2 verse 15 let's stand
[1:20:47] the Bible says study to show thyself
[1:20:53] he didn't say preacher
[1:20:57] study the show
[1:21:00] he says you study
[1:21:04] study to show thyself approved unto God
[1:21:07] a Workman
[1:21:10] a Workman
[1:21:12] somebody that goes to work
[1:21:15] not sorry and lazy a Workman that
[1:21:18] needeth not be ashamed
[1:21:21] rightly dividing
[1:21:23] the word of truth but shun profane and
[1:21:25] vain babblings for they will increase
[1:21:28] unto more ungodliness in other words
[1:21:30] it's going to take you away from God
[1:21:31] away from God and their word look will
[1:21:34] eat as death of canker
[1:21:37] and of whom is hymenius and philatus who
[1:21:40] concerning the truth
[1:21:42] now Paul preached them the truth but
[1:21:44] concerning the truth have aired error
[1:21:48] saying that the resurrection is passed
[1:21:50] already an overthrow the faith of some
[1:21:56] wow
[1:21:57] when I read that I was like Wow Let's
[1:22:00] Take it back take it back two thousand
[1:22:02] years we got a church service going on
[1:22:05] Phyllis and harmenists are preaching
[1:22:07] Paul's Doctrine
[1:22:12] and their word will eat his death of
[1:22:13] canker of whom is how menus and filters
[1:22:15] who concerning the truth Paul preached
[1:22:18] them the truth
[1:22:20] but what did they do have aired
[1:22:23] saying that the resurrection is passed
[1:22:24] already and what an overthrow the faith
[1:22:27] of some
[1:22:28] totally take them out of the picture
[1:22:30] totally take that Foundation of Faith
[1:22:33] away from them
[1:22:34] by false Doctrine that's my Prophet God
[1:22:37] had to come and preach the truth
[1:22:40] so now we have something to what
[1:22:41] something to rely on
[1:22:45] I rely on this message
[1:22:48] if that's not right I
[1:22:50] where are we gonna go
[1:22:54] where are we gonna go find me somebody
[1:22:56] find me somewhere
[1:23:00] Paul says right here real quick
[1:23:03] here's a prophet
[1:23:05] here's a guy that writes 80 percent of
[1:23:07] the Bible of the New Testament okay Paul
[1:23:09] really you know one of them double
[1:23:11] thumbs up like y'all do when you send
[1:23:13] messages
[1:23:14] it's not just one thumbs up it's like
[1:23:16] two
[1:23:17] or even three or four or five
[1:23:19] and a couple of smiley faces
[1:23:21] and praying hands
[1:23:24] so anyway
[1:23:27] we become Emoji crazy
[1:23:29] yeah we have don't look at me like that
[1:23:32] we send emojis for everything happy ones
[1:23:36] sad ones crying ones
[1:23:39] for we know that the law is spiritual
[1:23:41] but I am carnal soul to understand this
[1:23:44] is Paul talking
[1:23:45] everybody with me here just a minute
[1:23:47] that's Paul talking
[1:23:49] for that which I do
[1:23:51] ah now not
[1:23:54] for what I would
[1:23:56] that do I not I'm just playing that just
[1:23:59] a second
[1:24:02] but what I hate
[1:24:07] but what I hate
[1:24:10] that I do
[1:24:12] hate it but I do it anyway
[1:24:16] and this is a church ain't messenger did
[1:24:18] I ever tell you all that and he wrote 80
[1:24:19] of the New Testament and he was the
[1:24:21] prophet of God okay
[1:24:23] um
[1:24:24] if then I do that which I would not
[1:24:27] or should not
[1:24:28] I consent unto the law that it's good
[1:24:33] except in false Doctrine accepting false
[1:24:35] teaching it's good
[1:24:38] now then it is no more I that do it
[1:24:42] but he's let sin dwell in and take over
[1:24:47] all right for I know that in me that is
[1:24:51] in my flesh not his flesh in his flesh
[1:24:54] dwelleth no good thing
[1:24:56] he's talking about memories and
[1:24:58] conscious infection imagination because
[1:25:00] his soul at that time as writing the
[1:25:03] Bible has got to be born again God
[1:25:05] didn't write the Bible with sinners he
[1:25:08] wrote them with people with a new birth
[1:25:10] for I know that in me that is in my
[1:25:13] flesh dwellers no good thing for to will
[1:25:15] is present with me but how to perform
[1:25:20] but how this is pro this is the prophet
[1:25:23] but how to perform that which is good I
[1:25:26] find not
[1:25:27] yeah wow
[1:25:30] for the good that I would I do not in
[1:25:34] other words he's worrying against
[1:25:35] himself the things I want to do in my
[1:25:37] inner man my soul
[1:25:39] I I don't do it because it goes through
[1:25:41] that memories and conscious affection
[1:25:43] imagination and turns around and comes
[1:25:44] back this way
[1:25:46] a prophet wrote 80 percent of it okay
[1:25:49] for the good that I would I do not but
[1:25:52] the evil
[1:25:54] which I would not that I do
[1:25:57] he's honest he's being honest with us
[1:26:01] and with itself look now if I do that I
[1:26:05] would not
[1:26:06] it's no more than I do it but sin that
[1:26:09] dwelleth in me now it's not sinning in
[1:26:11] the soul
[1:26:12] he's a born again believer he has a
[1:26:15] spirit of God and his soul
[1:26:16] he's talking about his Spirit realm
[1:26:18] memory reason conscious affects
[1:26:19] imagination because you know what when
[1:26:21] Paul laid his head down he heard those
[1:26:24] Christians scream that he put in the
[1:26:25] Lion's Den I believe when Paul got up he
[1:26:29] got up looking out to Rome when he went
[1:26:31] to Rome and he'd see there that Coliseum
[1:26:33] and he said I put people in there
[1:26:36] that now follow me
[1:26:39] persecuted these people
[1:26:43] blaspheme
[1:26:45] but sin that dwelleth in me I find then
[1:26:47] a law
[1:26:49] that when I would do good
[1:26:51] evil is present
[1:26:55] for I Delight
[1:26:57] in the law of God
[1:26:59] after the inward guy
[1:27:02] the inward man
[1:27:04] one more time right here just get a song
[1:27:06] Ready but I see another law
[1:27:09] in my members
[1:27:12] warring against the law of my mind watch
[1:27:16] and bringing me into captivity to the
[1:27:20] law of sin which is in my members oh
[1:27:23] Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver
[1:27:25] me from the body of this death I thank
[1:27:29] God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so
[1:27:32] then when the mind with the Mind look
[1:27:34] with the mind
[1:27:35] I myself serve the law of God
[1:27:38] remember he's he's talking about
[1:27:39] Renewing Your Mind
[1:27:41] what he's doing is he's letting that
[1:27:42] Soul come up to the mind
[1:27:44] come up
[1:27:45] I myself serve the law of God but with
[1:27:48] the flesh the law of sin
[1:27:50] that's a church age messenger that's a
[1:27:52] that's a man that that truly was a
[1:27:54] born-again Believer and had the virtues
[1:27:56] working in his life but he still had
[1:27:57] problems he still had issues oh Wretched
[1:28:00] Man that I am but you know what he had
[1:28:02] to overcome that
[1:28:04] he overcame that
[1:28:06] because he had faith
[1:28:08] he said you'll be judged by what I say
[1:28:10] he must have thought pretty good not
[1:28:12] himself but what was inside of him was
[1:28:14] what was talking
[1:28:15] we got to understand when brother
[1:28:17] Branham spoke that was God speaking to
[1:28:19] us now not all the others the the life
[1:28:21] things
[1:28:23] but the doctrine
[1:28:25] that was God speaking to us
[1:28:27] that was a man moving himself out of the
[1:28:29] way so much he said I had to go back and
[1:28:31] listen to the tape to see what I said
[1:28:33] boy
[1:28:34] that's pretty good
[1:28:37] old Wretched Man that I am who shall
[1:28:39] deliver me from the body
[1:28:41] of this death because this death is
[1:28:44] starting in here
[1:28:46] this that your death starts inside it
[1:28:48] don't start here
[1:28:50] oh yeah this looks older and it gets
[1:28:51] older because of sin but what the death
[1:28:53] in you starts inside
[1:28:55] and works its way out
[1:28:57] let's sing a song God bless you
[1:29:00] I thank God through Jesus Christ Our
[1:29:02] Lord
[1:29:03] so with the mind I myself serve the law
[1:29:05] of God but with the flesh
[1:29:07] the law of sin
[1:29:09] there's only two things in your soul
[1:29:10] folks that's Faith or doubt
[1:29:12] one or the other there's no in between
[1:29:16] [Music]
[1:29:18] believe God believe what he said why
[1:29:20] would we come to church if we didn't
[1:29:21] believe what God Said all right so
[1:29:23] believe what he said listen
[1:29:27] me
[1:29:28] [Music]
[1:29:32] might become him
[1:29:34] by Grace
[1:29:37] it's all Grace
[1:29:40] oh he
[1:29:42] became me
[1:29:45] that I must
[1:29:49] [Music]
[1:29:55] why because he took my plate took my
[1:29:59] place
[1:30:00] so that I died
[1:30:03] [Music]
[1:30:19] but that was his plan was to defeat the
[1:30:22] Devil in human flesh and he's defeating
[1:30:25] through your human flesh
[1:30:28] became me
[1:30:32] let I might be coming
[1:30:37] by grace
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:57] oh he took my days
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:10] think about that oh he
[1:31:17] that I
[1:31:20] come in
[1:31:22] by Grace listen let's don't let the
[1:31:27] devil beat us up
[1:31:29] we're the bride
[1:31:32] we're the chosen
[1:31:35] and if we intentionally do the right
[1:31:37] things he's got to come on the scene
[1:31:40] he's got to
[1:31:43] he's got to reveal his word to you he's
[1:31:46] got brother Brown said one time he said
[1:31:47] if if if God doesn't do it the same way
[1:31:50] every time said you can go go to God and
[1:31:52] say look God you're a liar you lied
[1:31:55] right here that's pretty strong he said
[1:31:58] but no don't worry he's not going to be
[1:32:00] a liar that's why it can depend that man
[1:32:03] might lie to you but God will never lie
[1:32:06] to you Satan will lie to you every time
[1:32:08] his mouth's moving
[1:32:10] amen
[1:32:12] [Music]
[1:32:14] oh and he became me
[1:32:19] now
[1:32:25] see if it was for Grace Paul Couldn't
[1:32:28] Write what he wrote that I read y'all
[1:32:31] there's no way without Grace he could
[1:32:33] have wrote that because you know what he
[1:32:34] was condemned to die
[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:37] he persecuted Christians
[1:32:40] he made Christians die
[1:32:44] but God said
[1:32:45] I'm going to use you
[1:32:48] because you got a Zeal that's more than
[1:32:50] most other people got he said I'm going
[1:32:52] to turn that Zeal and I'm going to put
[1:32:54] it toward me but Paul still had that
[1:32:56] human part of him that said hey you did
[1:32:59] this you did that just like the devil
[1:33:01] doesn't do that to you pray for me it
[1:33:03] doesn't to me all the time you did this
[1:33:05] you did that you can't there's not a
[1:33:09] place in the Bible God says you can't
[1:33:12] he says you can if you'll believe me
[1:33:15] that's what I want us to take with us
[1:33:16] tonight believe what he said
[1:33:19] have a wonderful Thanksgiving enjoy your
