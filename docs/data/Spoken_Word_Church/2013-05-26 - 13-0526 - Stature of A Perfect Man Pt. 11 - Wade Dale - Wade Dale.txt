okaying hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello H hello hello it wasn't working last suay either was we had to get the audio off the video hello hello all right working now sometimes you have to kick it off and KCK it back on all right second Peter 1 second Peter 1 let's go and read this and then we're going to approach something today um it's going to help us right start right into Faith all right second Peter chapter 1 Simon Peter servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain to life see pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world to L besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness godl brother kindness to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be bearing and un fruit fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ right so I was trying to find another way to to get up a little bit and try to you know kind of stir your mind and it came to me Dad and I we're talking Monday or something Monday or Tuesday this week and and it kind of struck me on what he's preaching on Law and Grace and to me that's the bottom line we live by the law but if we don't have Grace then the law is going to condemn us very simple but very profound but the law you can't do away with the law cuz the law is a school Master the law is like I said it's like this table the law is like stainless steel the law is the hardest steal in the world you do this you die you do this you die you do this you die you look on a woman bless after in your heart ver committ adulter that's hard there's no wavering to that all right there's no wavering to things in Scripture that we do but there's a Grace blanket that goes over that that gives us Grace if we do make mistakes because God knows we're human but we have a Grace blanket to cover over that and then if you don't have that Grace blanket then you have to go back to where the scripture says in Revelations that they were judged by their works well law is the works you do this don't do that do this don't do that cuz when you go up to the Judgment you're going to they they said have I not done these Mighty things in your name have I not see they were trying to work their s up but without the grace blanket they're standing their NE they're standing there with whatever they' done that's what they've done and that's it well that's the law that's the Judgment but the grace blanket that goes over that which is the blood of Jesus Christ we know that but that's what covers back in the Old Testament see it covered Over law but when you go over to the New Testament it do does just cover sin it eradicates it like Daddy was saying about that you can be can't be justified you can be forgiven cuz you did do it right but when the real you comes and shows itself when the real you the Genesis 1: 126 and 27 when that real you comes and it never done it it never smoked drank Li cuss committed adultery never done any of those things that's why brother Brown said the real you didn't do it but the realization has to come that that real you is inside of you and it's working on the part that's outside and that's what we're going to listen to what the prophet has to say but but here's the steps and and I I like the um the way brother brandham even the way he preaches his sermons once he get to about 1960 or 61 when he comes in preaches the church ages God is setting a pattern he's setting a pattern for us to see does everybody understand that each message is a stepping stone to the next one right okay cuz watch what he says now we are approaching the Seven Seals we have just finished the seven Church ages and this is a message on teaching that ties the man in that's going to be Redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus and is going to be in that church age now he's not talking about a Church age he's talking about eternal Church age at the end of the seals now we know that we have seven trumpet seven plagues vile so forth that we get into as we go along but we're waiting for more room so people can be seated and I thought this would tie and I thought this was tie in just where I was expecting I didn't expect to to draw this skeleton but the other day there he was in the in the woods and God Drew this picture for it but I want to get it where everybody can see it hold it up here for just a minute but you see he drew that skeleton and then Peter didn't have this kind of a structure to go by Peter just said add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance not thinking about a pyramid but then when brother random was up in the woods he said God give him this all right so you add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temper Temper patience patience godliness godl brother kindness and then Divine love and then being a prophet he put this in here cuz he said if you'll read later on we'll read brother R said the holy spirit melds all that together or melts it all together seals it in now you're sealed until the day of your Redemption down here right when you're born again when you're born again we've been through this when you're born again that's the foundation you must be born again all right then add to your faith or to your Revelation or to your new birth virtue add to your new birth knowledge and that's what he's talking about because he went to the church ages he's saying now we got to do this for the man and then go over into the seals everybody got that mhm you watch him lay a pattern then he's got Daniel 70 weeks in there 1962 all that had to be set in order before he could bring the seals now what's he doing like Dad and I were talking the other day you can't just have baby form Faith listen this is a foundation for the rest of the whole of the whole U Sunday school you can't have baby faith and have a revelation a total revelation of the seventh seal can't do it brother brandham was right here when the Revelation came to him now how are you and I Ain going to be any different oh yeah we got a revelation brother Dale's got a revelation that brother R had a revelation that's our Revelation if we're if we're down here if we're here it becomes our Revelation not meaning you're not a Christian down here sure you are there's there's Untold billions if there's going to be a billion Christians in the world there's going to be a billion Christians that's never been at this place right here right right right all through the church ages they never reached even the even the first people Peter Paul James and all those they were right here at brotherly kindness they never had the headstone or Capstone revelation of the seals right but see you hear everybody and even people in this church they go go well I need I want to know about the seals well have you got this yet have you got all these virtues working in your life has this come to you as a revelation that the Seven Seals are what they are or are we just saying it was a revelation that brother Dale had that brother Brandon had white horse rider was the Antichrist woohoo that's easy to read that's that's just being able to read the quote but you see right here's why this is important I believe that's why the Lord impressed on me to come back and start over again on this cuz we've been through this before but really this time it's got to be an order just like what brother Brown said brother Brown said you got to get the church ages know what age you're in know what Revelation come to your age then what does he say right there the body the man got to bring the man in the outside guy because what's the seals for the seals are not for the cleansing of the Soul if you're born again right right you don't need to be cleansed in the soul right you need to be bodied so what's brother Rand doing he's bringing from the out of the church ages they didn't have that Revelation so he preached the church ages set all these in order set all the characteristics in order everything's in order so we know that's the foundation all right then he comes and just what he said a few minutes ago go back to that again and this is a message on teaching that ties the man in that's going to be Redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus now Jesus is not got to die again you got to see what he's already done he's got to come out of the church ages though cuz watch what he says and it's going to be be in that church age not not the seven Church ages he just preached no cuz he says that Eternal Church age at the end of the seals now we know that we got trumpets vs and all that so forth but we're waiting for more room in other words to preach it but but what we need to do is is quit is quit haunting so much on we we got the letter of the of what the seals are right we got the letter we've had brother Dale preach it we've had brother Brandon preach it we've had several others preach it hit on it and do a very good job but it's got to be a personal revelation right to you but before we need to know before anything and now we can have a knowledge and and you can have that laying there dorant okay you can have it laying there dormant in your in your in your soul cuz you got everything you need there if you got the Holy Ghost right but we limit the holy Holy Ghost by what we remember what we take in we limit it filters flu all that stuff okay but he's want brother R's want to tie the man in why he's wanting everybody to turn and look at the actions and reactions and the man and what the man does and and how the man works and and all these virtues that we're supposed to have working in our life then he talks about this holy Spirit coming and sealing it all in when I see you're sealed until the day of your Redemption if you're born again in your soul but Ephesians 1 says you only have an Earnest this is the down payment then God gives you a payment book right right it's got seven different payment book seven different pages in a payment book you know how you get a payment book if you make payment on a house or something tear that one off and you write a check and put it on there and turn it in right cuz you're making payments on the earnest money that you pull the earnest was right here but the Bible keeps going on in Ephesians says until the full purchase possession in other words when that title de to that house you're always real nervous while you making them payments cuz you missed four or five and you're they're going to come get you the house anyway not you right right so so you nervous about that but man when you got that deed in your hand that's a title deed to Redemption when you got that title de in your hand sure you got a you got a potential of it here Earnest until the full purchase possession which is what body spirit and soul cuz see here's where the seals comes Divine love that's where the Capstone Revelation that was lost down through time that nobody knew about except the Lord Jesus and it came to brother Brown then it has to come to me and you can't be just his Revelation but we got to have this working first before God can make that 100% working in our life cuz we're going to go through this and you keep watching the points brother B said you get up this far and what fall off get up this far and find a crack get up this far what what's he doing you're building up to him well now if brother brandham had any cracks sure he had little flaws in his ministry that he hadn't seen yet but when he come to the full revelation God corrected him right remember he said I wouldn't made a horrible mistake because he had an idea idea that wasn't a revelation and you can have that going up to here but once you get to here when you get to there when that Holy Spirit comes down and seals that together cuz remember you got to be where that God can say this is why he took brother rount on the mountain come down with the cloud he did the same thing like he did Jesus in Matthew 17 this is my beloved Son in whom I'm please to dwell now that was at the River Jordan that was at your new birth when God comes down and gives you the new birth he says to the world this is my beloved son or daughter in whom I'm pleased to dwell but he didn't say hear ye him until Jesus the Bible says he grew in Grace and knowledge being made perfect now Jesus was perfect the Christ but Jesus the man was human wasn't two people the same person but that human body had to learn to do things just like me and you did right but he didn't have a different Spirit you and I were born with a a contrary nature he was not born with a contrary nature so he was this walking on Earth in a body of Flesh we're going to read it in just a minute cuz brother R goes to Hebrews 10:5 a body thou Hast prepared me mean that's what happened the Old Testament built a body for God to step into called the baby Jesus all right but listen to my point like brother Rand said there's a there's a stepping stone cuz remember there's stones in the Bible which is revelation then there's a stumbling Stone the Bible said the rock of offense and they stumble Over The Stumbling Stone which is The Stumbling Stones down here which is Christ right see you got to remember see this pyramid this is the pyramid in itself these cornerstones are pyramids in the themselves so that just that just grows bigger and then God comes down with the total Apex of what he's always wanted and says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear what he's got to say cuz I'm the one that's talking through it he actually has come to the place to where he's got virtue my virtue God same m not mine but he's identifying brother r that brother R's got virtue like I had virtue when I walked on the shores of Galilee I've got knowledge I've give him Temperance I've give him patience CU these are gifts right these are gifts all right the problem is is we fall in here and we don't have to start all over but we have to start at a place to where we have to realize that God before you can reveal the seals to me I got to have these things working in my life and if I don't see these things working in my life that's where we need to work not work up there first grade second grade third grade we work on Elementary things now after the third grade if you walk up into third grade after the third grade's over you say I got to who man I'm going to 12th grade next next year you'd have a rude waiting me wouldn't you you walk in that 12th grade and that 1 plus one is going to help you but you going to see numbers you never seen before right right same way with the gospel you going to see things you never seen before and it's what it's going to do it's going to choke you or stunt your growth so the best thing for us to do is is to leave things alone we don't understand put it aside we've heard it it's in here it's in this it's in this computer that we have it's in that computer that's physically here and it's in the books and the Tes now where did Brother R say raps and Faith Life book books and the Tes so it's in there we don't have to go get it from from Charles Stanley or James doson no it come through William brand that's that's my son that I'm going to talk to you with and he was standing at a place to where that God could speak through him and it would be his thoughts there was no altering thought of a man's idea so that's what dad's preaching on now that's man's idea that's what's killing us our own ideas on the word of God that's what started in the garden of Ed all right and and to be honest with you there won't be a lot of people get to this spot right here but who's to choose we are is it for you to choose you choose whether you do but you're not going to choose where the Bob does or not right right so you got to say hey I got to do this I'm not worried about brother Bob if he wants some help we'll all help each other you understand what I'm saying but that's why brother R always said it's an individual Affair of God we're going to go into Rapture together but some's got to go by the grave remember we preached on the six seal there six seal purging if you can't come to a purging of True Body Spirit and soul you're going to have to die cuz that will be what will Purge you from your old man cuz your old man is going to still be there the same same body that Mom and Daddy brought is going to be in that ground but what's going to Quicken it the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead if he be in you he'll Quicken your mortal body and change those atoms into the person you should have been start with did Jesus in the garden the body because it was still a human body is that why he agonized sure he wouldn't have it if he had he never agonized afterward cuz remember after when he raised up he said all power all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me I can walk through that wall now if I want to I can do whatever I want to do with this flesh body to me that's what he was saying cuz he had all power in the Christ that he was you hear what I'm saying in the Christ that he was that's why his name is the Lord Jesus Christ not just Jesus there many jesuses but when you put Christ in there that shows that Eternal god well now you and I are little Christ when are we going to start putting our names together with that not literally but when are we going to start looking at it that way that if Christ in you the hope of glory what Paul said right not another Christ not a second person the same person that walked the shore that's why it's that's why that brother R told us and all those little stories he said you need to get into the into the U Spirit of the composer CU I've always said before if I write a book about my love for my wife y'all will read it and go good that's okay that's good wasn't there so but it's good read you know I enjoyed it it was okay close the book but if I could ever get what my experience was cuz I was there if I could get my experience of my spirit and put it in you you'll look at it in a different way cuz you'll know exactly what I'm talking about not just a good read well I don't want this to be just a good read right it's become just a good read everybody can read the message now cuz you can pull up quotes like this anywhere in the world anywhere you can get internet you can pull a quote up but it's the quote being made alive the quote's got to be made alive so we got work to do we're approaching the Seven Seals finish the church ages cuz the church Ages was what he brought all of the foundational doctrines back into the church right but if you read search A's book that's pretty much everything except like marriage and divorce and a couple of things later on but serpent SE one God no eternal hell I mean Church's book covers it all well that's what he was doing he was building it back to where we could do what have faith in what we're reading do we have faith in what we're reading like the Bible says don't forsake the assembling of yourself together and it says at the it says a little part that we don't read as the day approaches more so so my question is I'm asking Christians today do you go to church more today than you did before if not you backslid I'm reading the Bible am I telling you it's not my quote Yeah if you don't want to go to church more now than you did before then you're backsp this ought to be the most important part of your life amen how many of us could have jobs that we work on Sunday and make probably twice what we're making now I I know I could cuz I could choose a job I could in my field that I could work on Sunday but the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and then these things will be added all right so you tell the person you say hey I'm going to it's like I told U like I told somebody one time before and Dad's made mention about it I told somebody standing right up there in the right outside somebody said they got a a job for the glory of the Lord but they only going be here on Wednesday or Sunday and I said buddy God didn't give you that job you got that job out of your own intellect right cuz God wouldn't give you a job and cross what he said in the Bible you can't cross scripture just to get a job seek you first the kingdom of heaven and all these other things will fall in line so if you put that first what I'm saying about let's let's get these first let's get these working in our life before we start looking at the seal and maybe you know what we may see the seals in a different light once we have the virtues working because when we do then we have then become the one that wrote the book cuz see nobody understood what that book was even when it was open in Revelations 10:7 nobody understood what it was saying they just said oh listen open book and John ate it well that's good but what there must have been something written on it cuz the angel was very very adamant he said here take this thing and eat it CU there was something inside of it it wasn't just a book everybody says well we're in the age of the open book well that's good but there's something in that book that even though you got it open it's not been revealed right right so we need to take that book and leave it open and start turning the pages through virtue knowledge Temperance patience CU that's our guide book brother brandham preached that night after excuse me after that sermon what did he preach that morning he preached the statute of a perfect man that night he spoke on God of my life and he went through and told a lot of different things that happened in his life what was he doing he was punctuating he was was putting a punctuation or an exclamation point of what he preached that morning cuz he preached the statue of a perfect man then he preached the guide of my life or the or a guide and he showed how God had guided him up to that place when he gets to that place he can come and tell us he can't tell us about New York if he's never been I've never been in New York I can look at pictures I can read books I can even Google it I can Google Maps and I look right down on it and I can say oh man um what is that Time Square it's a beautiful place but never been there so I can't tell you but people that's been there and go man they can what they can give you detail the best way to get there and the best thing to see while you're there and the things not to see or not get caught up into well that's the way God is that's the way God is with the Holy Ghost he gives you a guide to lead you someplace because he's been there before and it's not New York it's a revelation so we need to walk into the Revelation and and watch this listen let's go down a little bit further if I had do page down how far will it go down huh a page all right let's look go ahead now these are not this is not continuous read if you'll notice the I just took the tag quotes that I wanted to read now let that soak in real deep not preaching this morning just teaching this lesson divine nature let me read the fourth verse again so you won't miss it for by we are given unto us exceeding great and precious Promises by these these promises we might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust see the world we've escaped that now yeah he's addressing this to the church in other words one that's already sealed in by the Holy Ghost all right and I'm going to use baby form cuz it is the baby form holy when you receive the Holy Ghost it's just like a baby walking you got to feed it you got to walk watch it you got to pick it up you got to teach it how to do this that's what God's doing he's teaching us how to do this thing that's why we're here this morning is to find out what is the way what is God's requirement now we read this before yeah but it's a requirement all right there's not a person in here that loves God but wants to become more like Christ now it's laid and now it's laid out here now if you want to be more like Christ it's laid out here he's speaking to tell us the steps it takes to be like Jesus all right every Christian I'm an old veteran look at brother and sister Kia they're probably the oldest in the building but i' ask them what's your heart desire to be closer to God when you learn of Christ there's something about him that's so loving you just try to get right into him all right now down to paragraph 51 cuz the people on the internet can't see it now he he has given us the outline here what to do pretty plain huh yeah know how to do it know how to do it now as I said we're trying to come closer to God that's why I chose this message this morning for the church knowing that people are traveling for last night I said how many here out of town then 90% of them is out of town those people don't come to church like that just to be seen as what the outside world will see beauty around this place they're all common people poor ordinary dress but there's no great anthems or angelic Flyers have a hard time getting to see but they come because inside of them is something that sees a beauty that the natural eye can't see it's a spiritual lie that catches the beauty of Christ that's why they come all right now you go down to paragraph 61 last Sunday brother brand preached on the key now what an appropriate way to start the statue of perfect man is the key cuz the door is there but unless you got a key yeah you can't have nothing behind that door unless you got a key now what does he say the key is key is Faith the faith holds the key and the key is the scripture and Christ is the door see so Faith takes the little hinges of the scripture and unlocks the glories and good of God out to his people see so it holds the key that unlocks Christ to the people if you got faith in something you got what confidence see man had not had confidence down through the church ages someone would tell them this someone would tell them this and same way in the message now somebody tell you this somebody tell you that but when you got confidence that somebody's bringing you the word of God you have confidence in that you can just lay your rest on that yeah all right you don't have to be tossed to and fro the Bible says by every wind of Doctrine So today we're going to try to take that same key now he preached on the key didn't preach on the virtues he preached on the key the way to get in all right which is Faith the way to get in So today we're going to try to take that same key to unlock the way to become not just a Christian cuz you're already a Christian if you're born again you're a Christian all right but a virtuous Christian in the stature of God that and be a living Tabernacle for the Living God to dwell in remember God revealed himself in three ways first he revealed pill of fire that was the fatherhood then that same God made manifest in Jesus Christ which he built the body made this body thirdly through the death of that body he Sanctified a church that he can dwell in it was God above us God With Us and God in us the same God then he goes through and tells about father son the Holy Ghost not three Gods now paragraph 67 statute of perfect man now we're going to study his word Steven said in Act 7 let's read remember where Steven was talking about the Tabernacle our fathers had a tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he was appointed speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen which also our fathers had our fathers that come in a after brought in Jesus unto the possession of the Gentiles who God drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of David who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him a house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as sayith the prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot St what house will you build me sayith the Lord what is the place of my rest now brother B goes right to Hebrews 10 and 5 now Tabernacle is of course a place where we go to rest now get freshness and so forth like resting from sleep or so forth now Hebrews 10:5 says wherefore when he cometh in the world he sayth sacrifice that's Christ and offerings thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me what is the Tabernacle now it's a body God tabernacling in a body God wants up high when he come down on the mountain even a bulock or cow touch the mountain he must be killed God is Holy last evening when those angels covered their faces holy seraphim with holy faces don't even know what sin means and they have to cover their face in the presence of God cover their feet in humility now holy God could not condone sin so nothing could touch the mountain where God was then God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the form of Jesus Christ his son his creation then that son gave his life and the blood cell of God was broken that the life might come out of the blood to us all right through the blood we are cleansed and now our blood our life which come by living through sexual desire brought our life in the world the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us changes our Nature by sending upon us the Holy Spirit then we become into the divine nature of God now that's what he was talking about when Peter says that having the divine nature he's still down at the bottom of the pyramid he went up he's still down there at Faith right right change our Nature by sending us the Holy Spirit then we become into the divine nature of God comma then we become a dwelling place for God Jesus said at that day you know that I'm in the father and the father me I in you and you in me so you see and we say oh we know that that that our body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and all these things well from what brother brand saying that's just getting you started the body come from sexual desire the the the the spirit comes from from God but it's perverted because the memory reason conscience affection imagination that's all let's just put it this way that's just all dirty and remember what we said before I don't know if you remember this but remember all that's what's in the past you don't have a memory of what you going to do tomorrow you have a memory of what you did in the past your reasoning is not on the future it's on what You' done in the past you reason on what you know about all right or think you think you know about your conscious what does your conscious do feeds on your path fast you don't have a conscious of what you do tomorrow cuz you haven't got there yet right now imagination you might be able to imagine things but how does that imagination come from it's what's built on what's from behind right and affection I can't love something I don't know anything about right I can't have affection for something I don't know about so it comes from what happens in the past so all this comes from past stuff but remember in the soul it's either Faith or doubt cut and dry w and remember faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen out here so that's what you got to have faith for you got to have faith that you can do this if you don't have faith that you can do this then you stop the process it's just as simple as that you're the one that can make it all the way or not you're the only one nobody else can do it the way I see it God gives us Faith first and that faith is what we need the most because that's what pulls us sure you got to have faith in it if you don't have faith in it then why do it you got to have faith in that virtue that you got faith in that's what Peter he had faith in what he had for the time he had faith for the time he had faith in what he had he couldn't have faith in something he didn't have he had faith for what he had because he believed that that's what he had all right let's go so
