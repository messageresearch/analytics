[4:37] and brother mike said tell y'all hello
[4:39] he's been he's preached about six times
[4:40] you know he had open-heart surgery a few
[4:43] months ago and he's doing a lot better
[4:44] so let's just remember him in prayer
[4:46] there's so much to pray about the list
[4:48] has got so long
[4:49] until um
[4:50] sometimes i just last night i said lord
[4:52] there's a list and i can't remember all
[4:54] of it i said but just remember them
[4:55] people on that list so
[4:57] hey man so let's just remember all those
[4:59] and we all have needs all things are
[5:01] going on
[5:02] in life with all this cover junk you
[5:03] know sister ruth is out she's got you
[5:05] know they announced that so
[5:07] just stay away if you're sick
[5:09] and wear a mask if you want to
[5:11] um
[5:12] i don't think this one's as bad as the
[5:14] other one is but still it's bad
[5:16] it's bad to be sick
[5:18] it's just bad to be sick bad to get old
[5:20] but it's bad to be old and sick that's
[5:22] what i'm getting old and sick
[5:25] so
[5:26] anyway
[5:27] so um
[5:28] all those announcements i know that
[5:30] sometimes you don't hear them all but i
[5:32] have got them online where you can where
[5:34] you can remember them so let's just
[5:35] remember those things coming up
[5:38] pray for the needs of brother louise he
[5:40] sounded really
[5:43] tired the other day when he sent that
[5:44] message
[5:45] to us and he's
[5:47] he's doing seven weeks of work
[5:50] i mean seven straight weeks of nothing
[5:52] but preaching
[5:54] traveling
[5:55] and he's doing a real good job and i
[5:56] believe the lord just gave him some
[5:58] really good fruit for that labor amen
[6:00] and when he gets back the lord will give
[6:01] him a rejuvenation because you know what
[6:03] when he comes back he's got to go back
[6:04] to work
[6:05] then you got to go back to the same old
[6:07] grind that he was in you know before i i
[6:09] know how that is because i went to the
[6:11] philippines for three weeks the first
[6:13] time i went and man it was great but boy
[6:15] when you come back everything piles up
[6:17] because your your life don't stop it
[6:19] just keeps moving and as you when you
[6:21] get home it's just boom dropped on top
[6:23] of you so
[6:24] so let's just remember brother louise so
[6:26] let's go to the lord in prayer we're
[6:27] going to continue on who is this son of
[6:28] man
[6:30] we're going to talk a little bit about
[6:31] the headstone today amen
[6:34] who is the headstone jesus christ
[6:37] head of the church
[6:39] our
[6:40] bridegroom
[6:41] amen so let's bow our head the heavenly
[6:44] father we thank you for this
[6:46] opportunity we have to speak to
[6:48] the greatest people that ever walked in
[6:50] the face of the earth
[6:51] they may be great athletes or great this
[6:53] or great that
[6:55] the lord they'll never be a greater
[6:58] group of people than the bride of jesus
[6:59] christ
[7:01] and lord we pray that you would be with
[7:02] us and bind us together help us to stay
[7:04] together lord and pray over these
[7:06] sicknesses and
[7:08] and bind the devil where he can't work
[7:09] in between us and where he can't get
[7:11] between us and
[7:13] lord will your just lord hold your bride
[7:15] closer and closer
[7:17] now toward the end father we pray that
[7:18] you would just
[7:20] continue to give us revelation
[7:22] we come here today to hear from you lord
[7:25] i was thinking last night father talking
[7:27] to you i know one thing's for sure the
[7:29] prophet said we are better or worse
[7:32] when we leave this service
[7:34] and just to be honest sometimes we're a
[7:36] little worse
[7:37] because we don't get everything that we
[7:39] need but father i pray today that
[7:40] everybody will be better
[7:42] it will get a better revelation a better
[7:44] time in you a better something that'll
[7:46] help us to grow in grace and knowledge
[7:49] and only you can do that lord but we
[7:52] have to have that desire today we've
[7:54] come to church with a desire to hear
[7:55] from you lord now i pray that you speak
[7:57] to the people be with all the ones that
[7:59] are sick lord the ones that are in this
[8:01] uh sanctuary lord that are sick and the
[8:03] ones outside the sanctuary i pray that
[8:05] you should be with them be the ones that
[8:06] are traveling
[8:07] bless our pastor lord and keep him
[8:09] strengthened and keep him strong
[8:11] we pray in jesus name
[8:13] amen
[8:15] this would be part 14.
[8:17] in the beginning was the word and the
[8:18] word was with god and the word was god
[8:21] he was in the world let's go to verse
[8:22] 10. i kind of cut through some of that
[8:24] he was in the world and the world was
[8:26] made by him and the world knew him not
[8:28] now here's the creator
[8:31] now listen everybody in this building
[8:32] knows who henry ford is
[8:35] right
[8:36] he created
[8:38] the first automobile
[8:40] amen
[8:41] so we know who that is we've got books
[8:43] about his life and
[8:44] but this man that created the world
[8:47] don't know who he is
[8:49] amen we know who this one is and who
[8:52] that one is by history but the world
[8:54] knew him not
[8:56] that's why we have to come out of the
[8:58] world to know him you'll only know him
[9:00] by the holy ghost and that means you've
[9:01] come out of the world
[9:03] to get into him all right he came unto
[9:05] his own and his own received him not so
[9:07] he came to the religious world he came
[9:10] to those people and they kicked him out
[9:13] okay but as many as received him amen
[9:16] see there's your out
[9:18] there's your way back
[9:19] but as many as received him to them gave
[9:22] he power
[9:23] to become the sons of god even to them
[9:25] that believe
[9:26] on his name which were born not of blood
[9:29] nor the will of the flesh nor the will
[9:30] of man but of god
[9:32] and that word was made flesh
[9:34] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[9:36] glory the glory is of the only begotten
[9:38] of the father
[9:39] full of grace not partial
[9:42] not barely uh full of grace and truth
[9:45] you may be seen in the lord as blessing
[9:47] to the reading of the word
[9:49] let's go to hebrews 10 5
[9:51] because when we talk about a body a body
[9:54] listen
[9:55] hebrews 10 5 wherefore when he cometh
[9:57] into the world he says sacrifice an
[9:59] offering thou wouldest not but a body
[10:02] has there prepared me now let's go to
[10:04] ephesians 5
[10:06] 23 and we'll comment on this just for a
[10:07] few minutes i was thinking about
[10:08] something this morning
[10:11] that we really need to cover for the
[10:12] husband is the head of the wife
[10:15] even as christ is the head of the church
[10:17] so he's bride groom
[10:20] we're bride amen
[10:23] only one
[10:24] he's our husband
[10:26] our old husband had to die
[10:28] or we're living in adultery amen
[10:31] all right so even as christ is the head
[10:32] of the church and he is the savior of
[10:35] the body now he didn't need his body
[10:37] saved you need to be saved amen his body
[10:40] needed to be made eternal but it didn't
[10:42] have to be saved from sin because it was
[10:44] sinless amen he was a sinless man
[10:48] came the right way came the way he was
[10:49] supposed to
[10:50] all right so now let's look at this
[10:52] though because go back to the next
[10:54] scripture to hebrews 10 5
[10:56] but a body has now prepared me
[10:59] actually he had to prepare two bodies
[11:03] now it's the same body
[11:06] but remember there was no bride body on
[11:08] the earth
[11:10] amen
[11:11] because what happened was in the garden
[11:13] of eden there had there was supposed to
[11:15] be listen the bride was supposed to been
[11:17] in the garden of eden
[11:19] his bride
[11:20] not eve
[11:22] us
[11:23] amen the genesis 1 26 was supposed to be
[11:26] developed in the garden of eden
[11:28] where there was there was no fall
[11:31] and we were to be married and we were to
[11:33] live forever and ever and do the things
[11:35] you know that were that we're going to
[11:36] do in the in the future home amen but
[11:39] listen to this
[11:41] he had to literally come down and
[11:44] prepare a body a baby like we just went
[11:47] through
[11:48] all right but he was also preparing a
[11:50] spiritual body
[11:53] because
[11:54] it wasn't the natural body anymore
[11:56] because in the garden of eden the
[11:58] marriage vows
[12:01] eve committed adultery
[12:04] against adam
[12:05] amen so there's no way jesus christ
[12:08] could come through that
[12:09] amen that's why he had to come in human
[12:11] flesh that's why he had to be the son of
[12:14] man because you get saved by the son of
[12:16] man the son of god saves you but you
[12:18] have to go through the son of man to get
[12:19] to him because all the father
[12:22] has given me
[12:24] will come to me
[12:25] amen so we know they're the same person
[12:27] but you got to go through jesus christ
[12:29] to get to god amen
[12:32] so he had a literal body
[12:34] that was created
[12:37] by a creative act of what bob was
[12:39] talking about of germ and
[12:41] and uh egg
[12:43] creative yes
[12:45] nothing we did nothing anybody did
[12:47] nothing even mary did
[12:49] but it was a creative act to bring
[12:51] though a literal body to come through a
[12:54] literal womb
[12:55] because that's where it all got messed
[12:57] up in the beginning
[12:59] we all know that but i'm setting a stage
[13:01] here
[13:02] it was marred in the garden so there's
[13:05] no there's no bride could come with
[13:07] flesh
[13:09] think about this there was no bride
[13:11] could come he he brought eve out of adam
[13:15] she was the same flesh as him
[13:18] that's right amen
[13:19] and then we were to come forth i believe
[13:21] by the spoken word of god amen
[13:24] just like we're spoken word children now
[13:27] but the marriage vows got marred not the
[13:29] vows but the liberal act got marred
[13:32] so that couldn't happen so then there
[13:33] had to be
[13:35] one come
[13:36] behold a virgin shall conceive and bring
[13:38] forth a child
[13:40] four thousand years later
[13:42] here comes the word made flesh
[13:44] but now what was his
[13:46] job
[13:47] it was to prepare himself a body
[13:50] and then prepare that spiritual body
[13:54] that he was going to have which turned
[13:56] into a literal body
[14:02] i think we're kind of literal now
[14:05] and if you're born again you're already
[14:06] the bride of jesus christ you're not
[14:08] going to be
[14:10] listen he hasn't reversed the effects of
[14:12] the fall in this thing yet but that's
[14:14] what we're looking toward
[14:16] that's what we're looking the son of man
[14:18] is now glorified
[14:19] in a glorified body that came marred
[14:24] not by sin
[14:25] but it was marked because it had to come
[14:27] into this world hey you're 50 years old
[14:29] he was 30 and he looked 50. that body
[14:31] was wore out
[14:33] but in the resurrection
[14:35] in the resurrection
[14:37] oh i know why the
[14:38] the
[14:40] mary couldn't recognize him and i know
[14:41] why cleopas and him couldn't recognize
[14:43] him he was a young man
[14:46] their eyes were withholding because he
[14:48] had turned back to a young guy he didn't
[14:49] look like that right there
[14:51] he looked like a young 20 year old man
[14:54] it looked old
[14:55] like they saw him as old but what's the
[14:58] first thing he did though
[15:00] he comes to the earth
[15:01] preaches his first sermon ye must be
[15:04] born again
[15:06] in other words what happened in the
[15:07] garden
[15:10] i've come to reverse that effect
[15:14] i know you're married to another husband
[15:16] we're not gonna get in marriage and
[15:17] divorce but you have to cover it
[15:20] you're married to another husband that
[15:21] husband's gonna die
[15:23] nicodemus
[15:25] that old husband
[15:27] has got to die
[15:28] nicodemus could never get that old
[15:30] husband killed because he kept looking
[15:32] back to the law
[15:33] he kept looking back to the old
[15:35] testament
[15:36] sure he believed jesus was something but
[15:38] i don't think he believed he was
[15:39] almighty god
[15:41] maybe a prophet
[15:44] but he did the best he could with what
[15:46] he had
[15:47] he wasn't supposed to see it
[15:50] so there was a literal body on
[15:52] earth that came on the earth to not get
[15:56] married
[15:57] literal let's talk a literal natural
[15:59] body jesus never got married on the
[16:01] earth he could have but he never got
[16:03] married
[16:04] he could have had a wife brother brown
[16:06] said he was a man amen
[16:09] but see that would have marred
[16:11] the plan
[16:14] he would come he come after a spiritual
[16:16] bride
[16:18] there was no natural bride on the earth
[16:20] that was worthy of this man
[16:24] sorry
[16:26] were you worthy
[16:27] no but when he came he made you remember
[16:29] the song he made
[16:31] me worthy
[16:33] and now by his grace
[16:35] amen
[16:37] he made me worthy
[16:38] he had to give his life and that's what
[16:40] we've been talking about the son of man
[16:42] had to die
[16:43] you can't kill the son of god
[16:46] son god's a creator god
[16:49] and you know enjoyed what chris said was
[16:51] talking about this weekend
[16:52] it kind of just dovetailed right into
[16:54] what we were what we've been talking
[16:55] about and we did not discuss it i'm just
[16:57] not going to discuss stuff
[16:59] stuff i don't mean stuff i'm not going
[17:01] to discuss the stuff i've been
[17:02] preaching because you get each other's
[17:04] spirit and you carry it on i want him to
[17:06] preach what god give him
[17:08] and then let you decide whether it was
[17:09] god or not
[17:11] that did it amen whether the holy ghost
[17:13] was leading him or whether it was just
[17:14] some notes he had wrote down same thing
[17:16] with me today so let's go to colossians
[17:19] 1 verse 15.
[17:21] ephesians 5 says the husband is the head
[17:22] of the wife and that's what we're
[17:23] talking we're going to talk about a
[17:24] little bit about the headstone after we
[17:26] get a little more
[17:27] background here we're going to talk
[17:28] about the headstone
[17:30] to the church
[17:32] but we got to get him here first
[17:34] we got to get him in human flesh here
[17:36] first so he can die
[17:38] so he can send back not the human flesh
[17:41] of jesus but send back the spirit to go
[17:43] into your flesh and make you the wife of
[17:46] jesus christ
[17:48] the bride of jesus christ so colossians
[17:50] 1 says who is the image of the invisible
[17:52] god
[17:53] the firstborn of every creature
[17:55] so in other words he came the right way
[17:57] he came the way he was supposed to come
[17:59] for by him were all things created that
[18:00] are in heaven that are in earth visible
[18:02] and invisible whether they be thrones or
[18:03] dominions or principalities or powers
[18:06] all things were created by him
[18:08] and for him
[18:09] and he is before all things and by him
[18:12] all things consist
[18:14] what a god
[18:16] but now look verse 18
[18:19] and he's head of the body
[18:22] the church
[18:23] all these great things that he is
[18:25] creator
[18:28] he come to get
[18:30] a body
[18:31] of believers
[18:34] and take us back to where there's no
[18:35] fall
[18:38] there's the eternal plan of redemption
[18:41] and he is the head of the body the
[18:43] church
[18:44] or the bride
[18:45] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[18:47] the dead that in all things he might
[18:50] have the preeminences so he was the
[18:52] firstborn listen he was the first one to
[18:54] resurrect and never die again now listen
[18:56] lazarus resurrected
[18:58] there was the bones of elisha somebody
[19:00] was thrown on the bones of elisha and
[19:01] somebody but they died
[19:04] everybody been raised from the dead they
[19:06] went ahead they died even lazarus had to
[19:07] die but this man died and raised again
[19:10] he never had to die again
[19:11] amen
[19:13] we know all the scriptures in that too
[19:16] look for it please the father then in
[19:18] him should all
[19:20] fullness
[19:21] dwell and that's what we're trying
[19:22] trying to get to is where brother brown
[19:24] tells us that you and i are the complete
[19:28] bride of jesus christ and being the
[19:29] complete bride of jesus christ you're
[19:32] the fullness of the godhead bot
[19:33] not in one person but as a collective
[19:36] body
[19:38] body of believers
[19:41] that's why
[19:43] i hate people that are critical about
[19:45] well this one don't have any depth or
[19:46] this one don't have any this one's
[19:48] shallow that's none of your business
[19:52] there's people that have a pinky
[19:54] and that's what they are they're the
[19:56] pinky but you know what they can cut
[19:58] that thing off
[20:00] you have trouble picking stuff up
[20:04] if you shun any of the fivefold ministry
[20:07] you're wrong
[20:09] if that fivefold ministry was sent from
[20:10] god i don't care how shallow he is i
[20:12] don't there's nothing shallow about the
[20:14] word of god
[20:15] there's nothing shallow about a man
[20:16] standing here and giving his heart
[20:19] and if he preaches on god's soul of the
[20:21] world that he gave his only begotten son
[20:23] you should be happy about that
[20:25] amen
[20:26] sometimes we get so revelated we don't
[20:28] have any business saying what we say but
[20:30] that's okay
[20:32] you'll learn one day that you probably
[20:34] don't know much either
[20:36] i don't
[20:37] i don't claim to i claim to come right
[20:39] here and stand and let him do the
[20:40] talking
[20:41] amen so i and i think that's what all
[20:43] preachers do
[20:45] they're supposed to preach
[20:48] some maybe you're not but that's not
[20:49] your business either you don't put them
[20:50] in a pulpit and you can't take them out
[20:53] amen
[20:54] please the father that he and him should
[20:56] all fullness dwell now if all that
[20:58] fullness dwell in that man
[21:01] and he's the head of the church
[21:04] where's that fullness guy land
[21:06] it's got a land in the church
[21:10] but him being the head of it all
[21:12] he had to come and reverse the effect of
[21:14] the fall and give us eternal life
[21:18] so look at number one quote we've read
[21:19] it many times
[21:21] in the masterpiece brother adam said
[21:23] body was built by the word which was the
[21:25] prophets and here comes the head of it
[21:27] all now this is the literal body of god
[21:30] this is in the old testament
[21:32] in the old testament they spoke of god
[21:36] coming literally in human flesh
[21:39] right
[21:40] so that's what he had to do if they
[21:42] spoke the word of god and that's what
[21:43] came from the mind of god and that's
[21:45] what they spoke when isaiah said a
[21:46] virgin shall conceive there's no way
[21:48] anybody can stop that that's right
[21:50] it had to happen
[21:51] so god had to come down into human flesh
[21:55] and be on the earth
[21:58] listen folks
[22:00] that's a word of promise
[22:03] from the old testament that was a word
[22:05] of promise that jesus stood on just like
[22:07] brother bible was talking about abraham
[22:09] abraham got a promise
[22:11] he stood on the promise
[22:13] he didn't worry about what somebody else
[22:15] said he didn't worry about his
[22:16] circumstances he stood on the promise of
[22:18] god even though he had all kind of
[22:20] faults and failures
[22:22] we keep dwelling on our faults and
[22:24] failures and we're going to stay here
[22:25] another 30 years
[22:27] hopefully not
[22:30] so look and here comes the head of it
[22:31] all jesus come on the scene so now we
[22:34] know for a fact jesus was the head of
[22:36] the church
[22:38] now then this head piece was put upon it
[22:41] we find in him the entire handiwork of
[22:44] god
[22:45] so now we're going to talk about this
[22:46] afternoon probably not this morning
[22:48] we're going to talk about the statue of
[22:49] a perfect man
[22:51] but we had to have someone that lived it
[22:54] first
[22:56] to its perfection
[22:58] because see
[23:00] paul peter all the all the saints they
[23:02] lived all this but they were not the
[23:05] headstone
[23:07] the bible says the headstone was
[23:08] rejected so it had to be what let's just
[23:11] put it this way it disappeared
[23:14] we know he didn't but it this it just it
[23:16] did disappear from the earth because
[23:18] when the head when the headstone left he
[23:20] went up
[23:22] the total fullness of god
[23:25] the faith of jesus christ the virtue of
[23:27] jesus christ the knowledge of jesus
[23:28] christ the temperance of jesus christ
[23:30] the patience god all those were his
[23:32] character
[23:34] but
[23:36] without that head
[23:39] i'll read you a quote this afternoon
[23:41] just like i read it a few days ago
[23:43] brother brown said
[23:44] the church ages got just enough of the
[23:47] holy ghost to make it through believe on
[23:50] jesus christ thou shalt be saved live a
[23:52] good christian life do what your
[23:54] messenger to your age says and then
[23:56] you're going to be hid away
[23:59] in that sixth dimension
[24:02] but somebody
[24:06] somebody has got to bring that head back
[24:08] because that's what resurrected jesus
[24:10] didn't resurrect without a head
[24:13] the fullness of the god had finally
[24:16] resurrected and then he sent it back
[24:19] into the church but what did they reject
[24:22] i'm sorry they rejected jesus in human
[24:26] flesh
[24:27] sorry because the son of god is how you
[24:30] get born again that's not jesus in human
[24:33] flesh
[24:34] it's through jesus in human flesh that
[24:37] you get born again everybody understand
[24:38] that without him i am the way the truth
[24:42] and the life but you only stood one day
[24:44] and he
[24:44] said there's no man good
[24:48] but god
[24:50] now he's standing there
[24:52] the perfect image of god
[24:55] in other words he was saying hey oh easy
[24:57] who you calling perfect that's what the
[24:59] pharisees were talking he said who you
[25:00] calling perfect
[25:02] he said there's only one
[25:04] we know where he was at
[25:06] but still you look at jesus he had he
[25:08] didn't have faults and failures but the
[25:10] bible said he learned
[25:13] by the things that he suffered
[25:16] we'll talk about that in just a second
[25:18] or maybe this afternoon i don't know
[25:19] whether i got my notes in here or not
[25:23] so there had to be a beginning of this
[25:25] creation
[25:28] the headstone had to stay where it was
[25:31] at
[25:33] son of man
[25:34] sent back to
[25:36] on pentecost he set back the baptism of
[25:38] the holy ghost to start his body
[25:41] now start his head
[25:42] he is the head but he came to start his
[25:45] body
[25:46] everybody got that
[25:48] come to start the body but now the body
[25:53] by
[25:54] itself can't take a
[25:57] resurrection
[26:00] it takes the body with the head
[26:03] to take come to the resurrection
[26:04] everybody got that
[26:07] then then why didn't they have take a
[26:09] rapture in the first church age
[26:11] second church chain third fourth fifth
[26:13] even in the sabbath that we call
[26:15] laodicea
[26:19] he's never thought about that though
[26:22] he did start the body
[26:24] the body of god started on the day of
[26:25] pentecost
[26:28] but never was the son of man understood
[26:30] anymore
[26:32] until now
[26:34] now peter and paul and james and all
[26:36] those different ones they had great
[26:38] signs and wonders
[26:40] right
[26:40] that's right and that's what we were
[26:42] supposed to be called back to by this
[26:44] prophet of malachi 4 to be called back
[26:46] to the faith of the fathers
[26:49] all right which is right here
[26:50] down
[26:54] we still got that to deal with
[26:57] because we're going to read here
[26:58] tomorrow or tonight where brother brown
[27:00] says
[27:01] we're not complete without him
[27:04] the church is not complete until that
[27:06] headstone comes down and unites with the
[27:09] body
[27:10] now listen we're not and don't get me
[27:12] wrong we're not a bunch of mindless
[27:13] people
[27:15] paul said we have the mind of christ
[27:18] but we're talking about god back in
[27:19] human flesh again just like you walked
[27:21] on the shores of galilee i read you a
[27:23] quote tonight where brother brown said
[27:25] he said a ministry just like what walked
[27:27] on the earth
[27:28] just like what walked on the earth it's
[27:31] what's going to take us out of here not
[27:34] one word off was jesus one word off
[27:37] no
[27:39] see that's my whole dealings because we
[27:42] still get that problem of you ain't
[27:43] perfect i ain't perfect
[27:45] and
[27:45] um i know chris mentioned it this
[27:47] weekend and and i believe it that we
[27:49] can't all agree on everything
[27:52] but still
[27:54] there's only one truth
[27:58] okay
[27:59] one truth
[28:01] and that truth has got to come through
[28:03] the bride
[28:04] in the end time
[28:06] alive and remain
[28:08] something's got to be preached that's
[28:10] going to catch me in you
[28:12] and bring us to that perfection
[28:15] well i ain't perfect and you ain't
[28:16] perfect well that's not what the bible
[28:18] said
[28:19] the bible said be therefore perfect
[28:22] even as your father in heaven is perfect
[28:24] now if the father had stayed in heaven
[28:26] no we wouldn't have got perfect been
[28:27] able to get perfect
[28:29] but see he lowered himself he immorphied
[28:32] in another form called jesus christ so
[28:35] see now i can understand god because he
[28:37] was a human man
[28:38] he walked on the earth he had to eat he
[28:40] had to sleep he had to do the things of
[28:41] the world not things of the world you
[28:43] understand but he had to eat he worked
[28:44] in the carpenter shop he wasn't just
[28:46] like you know he didn't walk in there
[28:49] this high everywhere he went and i don't
[28:51] believe that you know the catholics have
[28:52] this little halo all the way around him
[28:54] all the time you know this little glow
[28:56] uh no he was head
[28:59] no one understood him it would have been
[29:01] it would have been totally
[29:04] uh he would have been accepted by
[29:06] everybody if he'd walked in you know and
[29:08] dirt just fall off of him
[29:12] you know they spit on him and it just
[29:13] gets right here and stops
[29:16] you understand what i mean and
[29:17] everything he did was so perfect
[29:22] but he was so hid
[29:25] as a human being so they did not know
[29:26] who he was
[29:28] they called him everything but god
[29:30] amen
[29:31] amen
[29:34] that's the god i serve
[29:36] he showed me how to do it
[29:38] he showed me through jesus christ how to
[29:40] live this
[29:41] not say this message to live this bible
[29:45] which is the message of the hour
[29:47] and i'm like brother bob there's no way
[29:50] in heaven or hell
[29:52] that you can leave this message and be
[29:53] mourning him
[29:54] no way
[29:55] you can't pull yourself away from god if
[29:57] you've got god inside of you
[30:00] amen you just can't do it
[30:03] hey listen you might get confused
[30:06] we all do you might say well i don't
[30:07] understand that but when you say that
[30:09] ain't it and he's a liar and i'm leaving
[30:12] no you got a problem
[30:14] but god sent us a word of promise
[30:17] watch what this is in revelations 3 14
[30:19] the angel the church the layout of sins
[30:21] right these things saith the amen the
[30:22] faithful true witness the beginning of
[30:25] the creation of god he's going to have a
[30:27] creation
[30:29] just like he wanted in the garden of
[30:30] eden
[30:33] got to quit beating on the pulpit they
[30:35] got on to me i went you know in april i
[30:37] went and preached chris's easter meeting
[30:38] and he had a brand new pulpit sent all
[30:41] the way from ohio some amish had made it
[30:42] for him and it's just a beautiful
[30:44] uh made out of aspen and all kind of
[30:46] wood
[30:47] and that wood's just a little bit it's a
[30:49] little bit soft it's not like oak
[30:53] so i beat on it about 25 times during
[30:55] that weekend and it got
[30:56] beats and bangs all over it and chris
[30:59] told me he said you know what he said i
[31:00] kind of like that so he just took a
[31:01] hammer and bit and beat all around it
[31:03] put the little pop marks on it so
[31:06] sorry about that but get excited about
[31:08] god
[31:10] you ought to try it sometime
[31:12] the beginning of the creation of god
[31:14] and listen to this
[31:17] let's go to psalms 85 9.
[31:19] brother dale preached on this long i
[31:21] mean 20 years ago i remember him
[31:23] preaching on this psalm 85 verse 9
[31:26] surely his salvation is nigh them that
[31:28] fear him that glory may dwell in our
[31:31] land now here's the book of psalms
[31:33] here's david
[31:34] here's david a prophet
[31:37] mercy and truth
[31:39] are met together
[31:41] god and man become one
[31:44] righteousness and peace
[31:47] have kissed each other
[31:51] truth
[31:52] will read this this afternoon a little
[31:53] bit different than we're reading it
[31:54] today truth shall spring out of the
[31:56] earth
[31:57] and righteousness shall look down from
[31:59] heaven when god and man met
[32:02] heaven and earth kissed each other
[32:04] righteousness and peace kissed each
[32:06] other
[32:07] and became a man named jesus christ
[32:10] and man we'll get into that a little bit
[32:11] more i want to just keep going because
[32:12] we gotta we gotta get to a point here
[32:15] now look
[32:17] let's go to number two god's gift always
[32:18] finds their places
[32:21] it'll be all right
[32:23] and man this new year we we gotta go we
[32:25] gotta go we just gotta keep going this
[32:27] new year we got you know if you got uh
[32:30] if we got we all got issues and i'm
[32:31] ready to get rid of them
[32:33] you ought to be able to get rid of try
[32:34] to get rid of yours too
[32:36] some of us
[32:40] we i'm going to stop just a minute
[32:45] we baby our issue
[32:48] jim's got a sister that's got she takes
[32:52] 75 pills a day
[32:55] she's got every problem in the world
[32:57] but she's kind of one of those people
[32:59] that you know if god went by and said
[33:01] i'm going to heal you of everything you
[33:03] got
[33:05] she wouldn't do it
[33:07] some people love misery
[33:10] some people love to be sick so you can
[33:11] pity them we get out of that
[33:14] hey man stand up and go i don't want to
[33:16] feel bad i felt bad for a year i felt
[33:18] bad for a year it's time to quit feeling
[33:21] bad
[33:22] it's time to say
[33:24] i can't come to church because my nose
[33:25] is itching
[33:36] you know what it is it's babies rocking
[33:38] babies
[33:40] you don't get a lot when baby rocks a
[33:41] baby but when an adult gets a hold of a
[33:43] baby
[33:47] do the right thing
[33:50] you sit on the front row you're going to
[33:51] get picked on
[33:53] but look brother brown said he's a being
[33:55] on earth a being of time that's what
[33:57] that
[33:58] that baby had to be born
[34:00] according to the old testament come down
[34:01] into time all right i'm getting
[34:03] something
[34:04] which means that he must have had a
[34:06] beginning therefore he created himself a
[34:08] body to live in
[34:10] god himself created a body for himself
[34:13] but listen see it had to come by the
[34:15] word
[34:16] because look as his original as his
[34:19] original body his flesh body came by the
[34:21] word
[34:22] he couldn't become any different because
[34:24] he requires that his spiritual body come
[34:27] the same way
[34:29] by the word
[34:31] his spiritual body's got to come by the
[34:32] word because his natural body came by
[34:34] the word amen
[34:36] so that see that's where we can have
[34:37] confidence
[34:39] that god came just like he said he was
[34:41] going to come in the old testament and
[34:43] you and i according to the old and new
[34:45] testament are going to come the exact
[34:47] same way we got to have these virtues
[34:49] and they're the virtues of god they're
[34:51] the virtues of god that we couldn't
[34:52] understand until a man walked on the
[34:55] shores of galilee
[34:57] and
[34:58] it's recorded that virtue went from him
[35:01] it's recorded that he
[35:03] had the mind of god because he was god
[35:06] temperance patience we'll talk about
[35:08] that this afternoon
[35:11] created a body for himself
[35:13] that by this creation he might save the
[35:16] lost creation that he created
[35:20] all right now we know his body
[35:22] was not eternal
[35:24] yours wasn't either
[35:26] all right it's being made eternal
[35:29] his was being made eternal see how close
[35:31] he was he was so hid in that flesh
[35:33] nobody understood who he was
[35:36] nobody did even the devil had questions
[35:39] about it
[35:40] if you be the son of god do this
[35:43] if you be
[35:44] you think him being a spiritual being
[35:47] that was so close to that spiritual
[35:48] being that was in heaven
[35:51] he would have felt that same feeling but
[35:52] god was so wrapped up in that flesh till
[35:55] he hit him
[35:56] he hid him from the devil himself
[35:59] i believe that
[36:02] all right now let's go to the next one
[36:04] real quick
[36:07] loudest in church now show that he was
[36:09] the first
[36:10] how could god be created if he's a
[36:12] spirit how could he be he's eternal he
[36:15] never was created he never will be
[36:17] created we're talking about the son of
[36:19] god the creator the one that was before
[36:20] the foundation of the world
[36:23] but remember there's an in morphing or a
[36:25] changing of form
[36:28] of this
[36:29] man you can't understand
[36:31] to a man you can't understand
[36:33] can understand all right
[36:35] how could it be he's eternal he never
[36:37] was created he never will be created
[36:39] because he was god at the beginning
[36:43] listen
[36:47] he was so head to the world
[36:49] but don't we know how he was supposed to
[36:51] come
[36:54] didn't the prophets know how he was
[36:55] supposed to come they saw a vision
[36:58] that vision was projected on a piece of
[37:00] paper called an old testament
[37:02] what was written in the old testament
[37:03] all of us can pick up today and read
[37:05] scriptures about this man i'm talking
[37:07] about
[37:08] right
[37:09] so is it head to the world yes but for
[37:11] all those of us that can read the bible
[37:15] and have the new birth it's an open book
[37:16] for us
[37:17] so we can read that he came exactly the
[37:19] way he was supposed to come you and i
[37:22] are coming exactly the way we're
[37:23] supposed to come you say no this is a
[37:25] mess well listen in all this mess
[37:30] we're going to be blessed
[37:35] god's going to get the glory
[37:37] because satan says hey
[37:39] i got dibs on that i got dibs on that
[37:42] because you came the wrong way you came
[37:43] the way i made you come in the garden
[37:47] and god's like okay that's fine
[37:49] but
[37:51] i'm going to create myself a body
[37:53] ain't going to come from what you said
[37:55] was in the garden i'm going to create
[37:57] one
[37:59] i'm going to come down here and i'm
[38:00] going to save that group of people
[38:02] what almighty god we serve we're sister
[38:04] johnny when you need her what almighty
[38:05] god we serve
[38:08] but he that is the beginning of the
[38:09] creation of god was jesus christ when he
[38:12] was made manifest in other words when
[38:15] the word of promise was unveiled what is
[38:18] god what is jesus christ he's god
[38:21] unveiled
[38:23] veiled in human flesh but unveiled to me
[38:25] in you
[38:26] amen the book was closed now the book's
[38:28] open
[38:31] he's the beginning of the creation of
[38:32] god he came down and lived in it
[38:35] oh isn't he wonderful
[38:37] and what did he want what broke in the
[38:40] garden of eden
[38:41] that god wanted back
[38:44] fellowship
[38:46] he said adam i can't fellowship with you
[38:48] no more eve i can't fellowship with you
[38:50] no more you got to go out of the
[38:52] presence of god
[38:54] i've got to drive you out because i
[38:56] can't stand what you just did right man
[39:01] but there was a blood covering that god
[39:03] was looking through when that happened
[39:05] if not he'd had to kill them and start
[39:06] over again
[39:07] so there was a blood covering but god
[39:10] wanted that fellowship back where he
[39:11] could walk down the cooler today say hey
[39:13] adam how you doing that's what he's
[39:14] going to do when we get to the future
[39:15] home
[39:16] i believe we're going to be able to see
[39:17] jesus any time we want to and he's going
[39:19] to say hey how you doing
[39:21] you having a good day today
[39:23] yeah man i've been over it i've been in
[39:24] antarctica for about 50 million years
[39:27] over walking around on that ice
[39:30] it's pretty warm over there
[39:33] ain't that the way you go do you not
[39:34] think that
[39:36] man i think that way
[39:38] and i want god to show me things of how
[39:40] the world developed
[39:43] how the world literally developed now
[39:45] not all the sand and junk but i want to
[39:47] see how this one they said that you know
[39:49] that we populated north america when we
[39:51] come over the from russia to the polar
[39:54] ice you know they walked across that
[39:55] bridge or whatever it was and i'd like
[39:57] to see that
[39:59] you know what he said he'd give you the
[40:00] desire of your heart
[40:02] and we won't need a big old screen up
[40:03] there
[40:07] all you do is just say
[40:09] i want to be there
[40:11] and you'll be standing where it's
[40:12] supposed to be
[40:14] see that's what we're heading to but you
[40:15] know what that's what god was before
[40:16] this started too
[40:18] i'll be here how can god be right here
[40:20] talking to talking to this brother and
[40:22] be in china saving another brother
[40:25] remember it's a personal revelation so
[40:27] he's got to be the person
[40:29] how can he do that only god can do that
[40:32] i don't i can't do that see that's why
[40:34] i'm not the fullness of the godhead body
[40:36] only in one person i was thinking about
[40:38] this the other night you know you
[40:40] you take the the whole of
[40:43] christendom in the 60s
[40:45] 50s 60s
[40:47] there was only a few faith healers
[40:50] on the earth if you wanted to get healed
[40:53] you had to go see oral roberts billy
[40:54] graham
[40:55] different ones brother branham right
[40:59] so it was kind of closed up
[41:03] all right but now
[41:05] we're the fullness of the godhead bible
[41:08] and we're in every country in the world
[41:11] there's healings going on now in
[41:13] antarctica because there's a church up
[41:14] there there's believers there's bride
[41:16] where it couldn't have happened in the
[41:18] 40s and the 50s and the 60s it was so it
[41:20] was so pulled down to one place you had
[41:22] to go to a tent
[41:24] to get your healing you had to go to a
[41:26] community you had to go to a meeting you
[41:29] don't have to do that now
[41:31] we're scattered all over the world but
[41:33] it's the fullness
[41:35] of the godhead bodily
[41:36] the fullness of this world is going to
[41:38] be what is going to be populated by what
[41:41] little jesus is little gods amen
[41:44] oh isn't he wonderful
[41:47] now we know in luke 2 verse 49
[41:51] jesus was a kid
[41:53] they found him in the temple he said
[41:55] what's not i'll be about my father's
[41:56] business that'll be the next one
[41:59] he come to nazareth though it was
[42:00] subject under his parents
[42:02] verse 52 says and jesus increased in
[42:05] wisdom and stature not statue we knew we
[42:08] know he grew in statue
[42:10] because he would grow
[42:11] but stature is that what development
[42:15] right
[42:17] increased in wisdom and stature and in
[42:19] favor with god and man
[42:22] hebrews 5 verse 8
[42:26] though he were a son
[42:28] see though he were a son and we go back
[42:30] to uh we will talk about a little bit
[42:33] later about adoption
[42:35] though you're a son
[42:37] though you're a son
[42:39] you're born a son of god you're born a
[42:41] son in the in the in the economy of god
[42:43] you're born a dale or a black or
[42:45] whatever you want you're you're born
[42:47] that when you get born again you're a
[42:49] born-again believer but you're a baby
[42:53] you don't come full grown
[42:55] you're a b.a.b why
[42:57] baby
[43:01] problem is is the 60 year old baby
[43:07] and if you're 60 i'm not talking about
[43:08] you
[43:10] let's say 61.
[43:12] not you broke kyle you're a little bit
[43:13] older than that
[43:15] yet learned look yet learned he
[43:17] obedience
[43:19] by the things which he suffered
[43:21] that's why i'm telling you jesus as a
[43:23] human being made mistakes not in the
[43:25] word not in what we say oh he made a
[43:28] mistake he was looking at that
[43:29] prostitute no
[43:30] no
[43:31] he made mistakes
[43:34] like brother dale said he thought god
[43:35] was so divine that he couldn't stop stop
[43:37] his toe i believe if he hit a rock while
[43:40] he was running and it hit his toe he
[43:42] fell
[43:43] and you know what he probably had
[43:44] scrapes all the way down his arm just
[43:46] like you do
[43:48] so that's why i don't believe that if he
[43:50] if he fell 40 feet he broke something
[43:57] i'm just that way he was so much veiled
[43:59] in flesh
[44:00] till they didn't know who he was like i
[44:02] said before if he had come walking in
[44:04] the temple and and he looked like he had
[44:06] a
[44:06] um a neon light
[44:08] you know
[44:11] you know pulsating off of his body
[44:14] and he walks in and he points his finger
[44:16] at the ark and has it moved with his
[44:18] finger see that said oh that's god
[44:20] that's god he's finally here no he
[44:22] walked in and he said
[44:23] unless you believe that i'm he
[44:25] you'll die in your sins and he probably
[44:27] was wiping his nose
[44:30] man had blood running off his fingers
[44:31] from getting in the carpenter shot with
[44:33] his daddy and hit the wrong nail
[44:36] y'all never done that before
[44:39] hit these nails instead of the nails
[44:40] that you're supposed to hit yeah it's
[44:41] what's up
[44:42] so you learned he obedience by the
[44:45] things which he suffered look and being
[44:47] made perfect
[44:49] now listen he came the perfect son of
[44:50] god
[44:52] but he came as the son of man
[44:54] all right everybody got that i'm not
[44:57] saying jesus was not perfect in his
[44:58] doctrine he was perfect but in his
[45:00] humanity
[45:03] they didn't know who he was
[45:04] same way with me and you how you know
[45:06] we're the bride of jesus christ and here
[45:08] we are walking through the world we get
[45:09] covered we have to go to the doctor
[45:12] we have to go but it's our confession
[45:15] it's our confession we got to keep
[45:16] confessing it keep confessing that you
[45:19] are what you are
[45:22] even though we might look
[45:24] horrible
[45:25] to the world
[45:27] the day jesus was crucified the world
[45:30] said
[45:31] that can't be god
[45:35] god would not let that happen
[45:37] right
[45:39] caiaphas said
[45:41] can't even save himself he said he could
[45:43] save others can't even save himself
[45:46] wow
[45:47] what's a mission
[45:50] he learned to bring these now listen
[45:54] i believe jesus christ was god almighty
[45:56] and human flesh
[45:58] and he didn't have to
[46:00] get virtue
[46:02] he had it already
[46:04] but he had to learn how to use it
[46:07] everybody okay with that
[46:09] he had to learn how to use it i just
[46:11] read he learned
[46:12] by the things that he suffered
[46:15] he learned that that's why that you see
[46:18] jesus's ministry started when he was 30
[46:19] years old my he had 30 years
[46:23] that we don't know much about
[46:25] except for just a few minutes in the
[46:26] temple when he was 13 years old
[46:31] so he developed
[46:33] he learned virtue
[46:35] knowledge
[46:36] he learned how to use it
[46:38] me and you were born in sin
[46:41] we were born on this side of the chasm
[46:43] we didn't come with the virtue of god in
[46:45] us
[46:46] because
[46:47] peter would have said
[46:49] just let what's inside of you live no he
[46:51] said add
[46:53] add to your faith virtue
[46:56] add to your faith knowledge
[46:59] and look he says and being made perfect
[47:01] he became the author
[47:03] huh what is an author he writes a book
[47:07] and that book you read and when you read
[47:08] the book and he talks about itself
[47:11] and you see the characteristics and you
[47:13] see the word be made manifest
[47:15] that's my kind of author
[47:18] it's non-fiction
[47:20] it was written by the man that
[47:21] went through
[47:22] it and being made perfect he became the
[47:25] author of eternal salvation look
[47:29] not just anybody
[47:32] unto
[47:33] all them
[47:35] that obey him
[47:37] everybody got that
[47:40] so jesus came here with the virtues but
[47:42] learned how to bring him through his
[47:44] flesh
[47:47] you and i were born with a carnal mind
[47:48] we don't have the virtue of god we've
[47:50] got to get the new birth first
[47:52] that's why we got to be born again
[47:54] that's why jesus started with his first
[47:56] doctrine you got to be born again
[47:58] nicodemus you're a good guy
[48:00] but you got to be born again
[48:04] everybody okay
[48:08] now let's skip to matthew three
[48:11] i'm not gonna get finished with this
[48:14] i wanted to get to a spot i'll get to it
[48:15] anyway if i have to get
[48:17] get through something
[48:19] john 3
[48:21] when jesus was baptized he went straight
[48:23] way out of the water the low the heavens
[48:25] were opened unto him and he saw the
[48:26] spirit of god descending like a dove and
[48:27] lighting upon him a little voice from
[48:29] heaven saying this is my beloved son in
[48:31] whom i am well pleased now why didn't
[48:34] jesus why didn't god why didn't that
[48:35] voice go ahead and say
[48:38] hear you him
[48:42] because he didn't say that to you when
[48:44] you got born again
[48:46] he said i'm pleased to dwell in that
[48:48] vessel but you got to learn
[48:51] those virtues
[48:53] you've got to learn that i'm fixing to
[48:54] put it in you like we're going to read
[48:56] in a little while the divine nature of
[48:58] god has got to be put in what is the
[48:59] divine nature of god
[49:03] but you got to get bored again first
[49:04] before you can quicken any of these
[49:05] virtues because yes i agree 100
[49:09] when you get born again you get all you
[49:11] need for your journey
[49:13] amen when thomas was born
[49:16] he got every part he'll ever have he's
[49:18] not going to grow another one
[49:20] right
[49:21] your hair might get a little longer you
[49:22] might grow some fuzzy on your face
[49:24] but it always still inside of you
[49:27] my hormones and all that it's not
[49:28] something you had to acquire
[49:31] all you had to do was eat
[49:33] same way with this all you got to do is
[49:35] eat
[49:36] they're there but what they're laying
[49:38] there
[49:39] you gotta learn
[49:41] how to control virtue
[49:43] power
[49:44] without character
[49:47] is satanic
[49:49] but power with character what is
[49:51] character that's the character of god
[49:56] but power with character see jesus the
[49:59] head because he's the headstone
[50:01] born right the first time he controlled
[50:03] all that
[50:05] he so controlled itself to when he went
[50:07] to calvary
[50:10] he was done
[50:12] he could have moved his finger listen he
[50:14] could have thought in his mind
[50:16] i need help
[50:18] and there would have been legions of
[50:20] angels come and just destroyed the earth
[50:22] and took him off that cross but you know
[50:23] what
[50:25] didn't want that
[50:27] he had that control
[50:31] and like i said i've always told y'all
[50:32] we don't you don't sin in your soul if
[50:34] you're born again you don't sin in your
[50:36] flesh your flesh just isn't it just what
[50:41] puts it in motion
[50:45] see takes phil smelling here that's
[50:46] where god and satan both that's that as
[50:50] chris was talking about the conflict
[50:51] between god and satan
[50:53] the conflict is you
[50:56] and it's in your brain
[50:58] up here
[50:59] that's the conflict
[51:01] you are the conflict
[51:04] aren't we the conflict don't the
[51:06] conflicting thing of me is is that like
[51:08] paul says the things i would not i do
[51:10] the things i do that i don't want to do
[51:13] i do them anyway
[51:14] now that didn't mean that he was once a
[51:16] drunk and he went back to being a drunk
[51:18] no he knew he was a human being he had
[51:20] desires feelings emotions and all these
[51:22] different things that he was trying to
[51:24] get in control
[51:27] and not let it control him
[51:31] see that's our problem sometimes we let
[51:32] other things control us
[51:35] and that's why
[51:36] i read you the scripture a minute ago
[51:37] about having preeminence you know what
[51:39] preeminence is complete control
[51:42] that he might have the preeminences full
[51:44] control of me and you when brother
[51:47] bradham stepped out of the way
[51:50] that's why that's our sign
[51:52] brother brown wasn't a son of man but it
[51:53] was a sign
[51:54] the sign was brother brown said what did
[51:56] i just say
[51:58] he was so out of the way
[52:00] he was so out of the picture
[52:02] he didn't even know what he was saying
[52:04] right now
[52:05] he said what did i just say
[52:08] and somebody'd have to tell him
[52:10] i remember one time i was listening the
[52:12] other day he said i had to go back and
[52:14] listen to the tape to see what i said
[52:18] that's being so much out of the way you
[52:20] don't even know what you're talking
[52:21] about but
[52:22] some of us get that way
[52:24] come on people
[52:27] it's that four inch pipe is greased
[52:29] from your brain to your mouth and we
[52:32] don't control it but you know what if
[52:34] you let god take that four inch pipe
[52:38] he can take what that what he gives you
[52:40] because we have to process it through
[52:42] our brain
[52:43] brother brown had to process everything
[52:45] through his brain except when he was in
[52:47] discernment he didn't have to do that
[52:49] what did i say
[52:52] i barely remember he uh you know billy
[52:54] paul said sit for hours after he'd take
[52:56] him to the hotel he just lay down in the
[52:58] bed
[53:00] because he was numb brother brown said
[53:01] one time he said i was numb for days
[53:04] after something happened can you imagine
[53:07] being numb and out of it where you don't
[53:08] even know where you're at for days just
[53:10] because what did you do you moved
[53:12] yourself out of the way and let god take
[53:13] over
[53:15] but now i believe though coming to the
[53:17] end time right now we're not going to be
[53:19] that way
[53:20] i'm just going to tell you if we come to
[53:22] a place of resurrection and we've come
[53:24] to a place of speaking the word of god
[53:26] it's not going to hurt us like it did
[53:28] him he was one man
[53:30] taking that whole load
[53:33] on him
[53:34] now that load is being dispersed
[53:37] i don't have to be william branham
[53:39] i can be myself and have my part in the
[53:41] body
[53:42] you can have your part in the body you
[53:44] can have your revelation and your
[53:47] resurrection and your power
[53:49] and your authority
[53:51] but it all comes under the headship of
[53:53] that man right there
[53:55] now when we come out from under headship
[53:57] what was problem with eve she came out
[53:58] from under headship
[54:00] what's the first person that was
[54:01] standing there when she came out of
[54:02] headship satan
[54:05] he deceived the bride
[54:07] the first time she moved out of headship
[54:09] right that's what happened with the
[54:10] nominations there was a baptist bride
[54:12] folks
[54:15] can somebody amen
[54:16] i'll read you a quote where brother mom
[54:17] said they had the word at one time
[54:20] but what did they do
[54:22] moved out from under the headship of the
[54:23] word of god
[54:24] took their own ideas
[54:27] and run with it that's why they're
[54:28] illegitimate
[54:29] brother brown calls them prostitutes why
[54:32] they've moved out from under headship
[54:34] they've done just what he did that's why
[54:36] that we have now
[54:38] in the end time got to come back under
[54:40] headship
[54:41] of the son of man
[54:44] and be able to live this life is
[54:45] everybody okay with this i want to make
[54:46] sure that we get i don't want you to
[54:48] know one thing for sure
[54:50] jesus wasn't wrong we've heard preachers
[54:52] well i haven't heard but i heard a
[54:54] preacher preaching one time that it said
[54:56] jesus did said things wrong you know he
[54:58] might have said tuesday was wednesday i
[54:59] don't know but he never
[55:02] ever
[55:03] according to the word of god said
[55:04] anything contrary to his father
[55:07] now listen we do
[55:10] hello somebody
[55:11] we do all the time
[55:13] but there's got to come down a time to
[55:15] where that's kind of what take over
[55:18] as it did that little five foot five
[55:20] foot five inch man
[55:23] from kentucky
[55:25] where he took complete control of his
[55:26] body
[55:27] and one time he said this is not william
[55:29] branham you're hearing right
[55:31] he said this is me i'm just using his
[55:35] voice
[55:37] please let him use our voice if he uses
[55:40] our voice we are then perfect
[55:48] that's why i said folks we need to let
[55:49] out what we got inside of us
[55:51] let it go
[55:55] there's a lot of things we really do
[55:56] need to let go
[55:59] amen
[56:00] now us look
[56:04] the bible in romans 8
[56:07] says that you and i
[56:10] right you and i this adoption we are to
[56:13] be manifested
[56:15] sons of god
[56:17] now listen jesus was the son of man
[56:21] and that's what he manifested
[56:24] nothing different
[56:26] right
[56:28] so the son of god's been manifested down
[56:30] through church ages
[56:32] are okay with that
[56:34] get them saved get them in church get
[56:36] them to quit doing the things they were
[56:38] doing
[56:39] but you see you got luther you got
[56:40] luther that come out of the catholic
[56:42] church and god anointed him to do a job
[56:45] and brought people in the body of christ
[56:48] sitting in a pub
[56:50] drinking beer and smoking his pot
[56:55] we can't do that because we've got a
[56:57] furthermore of the word the book's been
[56:58] open
[57:01] the book wasn't open when he had it
[57:03] when luther was there even when wesley
[57:05] was there
[57:07] even pentecost but what did pentecost do
[57:10] they were under headship the holy ghost
[57:12] fell in 1906 is industry the word of god
[57:17] to restore the gifts
[57:18] but what happened they said this is it
[57:21] there's no more
[57:23] so they stepped out from under headship
[57:26] god said i can't use you anymore
[57:29] because you've defiled yourself
[57:31] with man's ideas
[57:33] so i'm gonna bring a prophet on the
[57:35] scene
[57:36] and that prophet's gonna restore
[57:39] not just the gifts back in the church
[57:41] the gifts were already restored when
[57:42] brother brown came on the scene he
[57:44] didn't have to restore the gifts
[57:45] the gifts were already working but what
[57:48] were they doing they said well
[57:49] this is it
[57:51] they get up and somebody go to shouting
[57:53] and speaking in tongues while the
[57:54] preacher was preaching it wasn't in
[57:55] order the prophet of god had to do like
[57:57] elijah
[57:58] when those prophets had beat the altar
[58:00] down what do you do he put them all he
[58:02] restored
[58:03] fellowship and he restored how to have a
[58:06] church
[58:08] he restored
[58:11] fellowship
[58:13] what a man that could talk to god
[58:16] like brother branham
[58:18] i mean come on people have you ever had
[58:20] god come down and and brother brown said
[58:22] stand right there beside me
[58:24] and say come and walk with me
[58:27] come walk with me now he wasn't standing
[58:28] there physically but you understand when
[58:30] he was up there you know he's hunting
[58:31] and the deer did what they did you know
[58:33] they came up to him
[58:34] remember what god say
[58:37] come and walk with me
[58:40] and there was a prophet
[58:43] walking down
[58:45] down a deer trail
[58:46] with god beside
[58:48] him he so
[58:51] reverenced god
[58:53] till god
[58:54] felt comfortable
[58:56] with walking with him
[58:58] god felt comfortable using his voice yes
[59:03] god felt comfortable using his mind to
[59:06] write notes to preach us 1100 sermons
[59:10] which was god talking to us
[59:12] not william branham
[59:14] that's why if you turn william branham
[59:16] down
[59:17] in the voice
[59:19] you turn god down
[59:22] now the things he did the things he did
[59:23] first i don't care
[59:25] i don't care if he got a
[59:28] date wrong
[59:31] but what happened when he was out there
[59:34] he got a commission
[59:36] to go back to jeffersonville and open
[59:39] the book
[59:40] that's good enough for me
[59:43] you can you know there's been all kind
[59:45] of dissertations on the cloud whatever
[59:47] you want to believe
[59:49] i just bottom line
[59:51] he showed me god
[59:54] he showed me how to get access to god
[59:58] he showed me in the word where no
[59:59] denomination ever showed me how to get
[1:00:01] to god
[1:00:02] nobody else showed me how to get to god
[1:00:05] what he preached showed me how to get to
[1:00:06] god
[1:00:08] and why
[1:00:09] the why of it
[1:00:12] why because we were lost
[1:00:16] even though we had a
[1:00:17] a decent understanding of religion
[1:00:21] in the baptist and the methods and
[1:00:22] pentecostals and different churches we'd
[1:00:24] have the full understanding
[1:00:27] we'd live a peace and then the peace
[1:00:28] would be left out
[1:00:29] we could live a peace and the peace
[1:00:31] would be left out luther lived to peace
[1:00:33] but a peace got left out
[1:00:35] right
[1:00:36] that's the same way with us but see the
[1:00:38] bible says but when the fullness has
[1:00:39] come
[1:00:43] not just faith first your knowledge
[1:00:44] temper face of godliness brother
[1:00:46] kindness
[1:00:47] the headstone
[1:00:49] that's why the holy ghost is up there
[1:00:51] not down at the bottom we know we get
[1:00:52] faith we get the baptism of the holy
[1:00:54] ghost because it's the divine nature of
[1:00:55] god we'll talk about that tonight this
[1:00:56] afternoon but that holy spirit seals
[1:00:59] that in it what does it do it puts a
[1:01:02] stamp yes
[1:01:05] this is my beloved son now you hear what
[1:01:08] he's saying
[1:01:10] he put his stamp of approval on the
[1:01:13] mountain in matthew
[1:01:15] and said
[1:01:17] you got to hear this guy
[1:01:22] let's skip to that brothers let's go to
[1:01:23] matthew 17 verse 8.
[1:01:26] real quick because i want to get right
[1:01:27] here
[1:01:30] then we'll start this afternoon
[1:01:33] i hope this is helping us to realize
[1:01:35] what our commission is
[1:01:37] not just to come to church
[1:01:42] that's what i was thinking last night i
[1:01:43] said lord
[1:01:45] have you ever been honest with yourself
[1:01:47] and said lord i didn't get anything out
[1:01:48] of that service brother brian said you
[1:01:50] either get better
[1:01:52] you leave that door better or worse i've
[1:01:54] left that door worse
[1:01:57] because i didn't pay attention to
[1:01:59] everything that was being said
[1:02:04] i had stuff in my head
[1:02:07] but you know what there's days i walked
[1:02:09] out that door
[1:02:11] just like when chris was preaching the
[1:02:12] other day i wrote one word down
[1:02:14] and i'll preach about ten sermons on
[1:02:16] that one word and i'm gonna tell you
[1:02:17] what i do
[1:02:19] but it's got something to do with
[1:02:20] surgery
[1:02:21] but i wrote that down and then you and
[1:02:23] that's the way god works so see i had
[1:02:25] fellowship
[1:02:26] that fellowship with what what what he
[1:02:28] said that word i got you probably got
[1:02:30] another one you probably could you
[1:02:32] probably can remember a phrase he said
[1:02:34] that i can't remember why because we're
[1:02:36] a body
[1:02:38] we're a body but when we bring it
[1:02:40] together it's got a dovetail it can't be
[1:02:43] like this
[1:02:44] you can't you can't hear what brother
[1:02:46] chris said and get a wrong doctrine if i
[1:02:48] heard him and got a right doctrine
[1:02:50] somebody's wrong
[1:02:52] you both can't be right as brother brown
[1:02:54] said you both can't be right
[1:02:57] so this is on the mountain
[1:02:59] god had just identified and put a stamp
[1:03:01] of approval on jesus
[1:03:04] in tithe listen he was almighty god but
[1:03:06] i believe he came to a place
[1:03:09] he learned by the things he suffered and
[1:03:11] being made perfect he's come to a place
[1:03:13] that now he can go to calvary and say
[1:03:17] not my will
[1:03:19] but thy will be done that's right
[1:03:22] everybody okay
[1:03:23] all right let's listen right here
[1:03:25] when they lifted up their eyes they saw
[1:03:27] no man save jesus
[1:03:28] only and as they came down from the
[1:03:31] mountain jesus charged him saying tell
[1:03:32] the vision
[1:03:34] in other words tell what that do not
[1:03:35] tell what you saw
[1:03:40] so that they were in a vision
[1:03:42] remember they looked up and saw elijah
[1:03:44] and moses
[1:03:45] and jesus
[1:03:46] had to be a vision
[1:03:48] and then a a cloud comes down and a
[1:03:51] voice out of the clown
[1:03:53] okay
[1:03:54] i like what brother chris was preaching
[1:03:56] i loved everything he's preaching but
[1:03:57] the symbols
[1:03:59] watch those symbols they're symbols but
[1:04:01] they have a meaning to them everything
[1:04:03] has a meaning to it
[1:04:05] doesn't matter if you're in a concert
[1:04:06] with a thousand
[1:04:08] uh musicians
[1:04:09] everybody's got a note to play
[1:04:13] and if you toot when you're supposed to
[1:04:14] not
[1:04:16] everybody hear it and it's off
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:20] when you're supposed to pause and
[1:04:21] somebody goes
[1:04:24] you know there's something wrong
[1:04:27] all right look
[1:04:29] we'll be done right here
[1:04:31] sorry
[1:04:32] tell the vision to no man
[1:04:35] why'd he say that nobody's gonna
[1:04:36] understand it
[1:04:39] because peter says i have a more sure
[1:04:41] word of prophecy i was on that mountain
[1:04:43] i saw what happened but i didn't
[1:04:45] understand what happened
[1:04:48] because peter's wanting to build
[1:04:49] tabernacles three of them
[1:04:52] i bet he reversed his
[1:04:54] thought process when he got the holy
[1:04:56] ghost because he never mentioned it
[1:04:57] again except one time he said i have now
[1:04:59] a more sure word of prophecy i was on
[1:05:01] the mountain that day
[1:05:03] but see the word of prophecy is now that
[1:05:04] jesus
[1:05:06] is almighty god
[1:05:08] they didn't know he was almighty god
[1:05:09] right here they didn't have the new
[1:05:11] birth you can't know that jesus you say
[1:05:13] oh i know jesus is one he's almighty god
[1:05:16] you're just quoting what somebody said
[1:05:18] until you get the new birth and then
[1:05:20] that speaks back out from you
[1:05:23] you're just presuming
[1:05:25] that's what brother brown said he said
[1:05:26] we we're only presuming if he don't come
[1:05:28] and show us these things
[1:05:31] tell the vision no man until the son of
[1:05:32] man be risen again from the dead so in
[1:05:34] other words he had to die he's going to
[1:05:36] be risen again because of this
[1:05:38] and his disciples asked him saying why
[1:05:40] then say the scribes that he lost must
[1:05:42] first come they went to malachi
[1:05:44] malachi said behold i send you elijah
[1:05:46] the prophet before the great and
[1:05:47] reference of the lord they're quoting
[1:05:48] malachi same scripture we're quoting
[1:05:52] but jesus said to them eli shall truly
[1:05:55] i'm sorry elise truly shall first come
[1:05:58] and restore
[1:06:00] all things
[1:06:02] john the baptist did not restore all
[1:06:04] things
[1:06:05] he introduced the messiah
[1:06:08] he didn't restore he turned them back
[1:06:10] sure he turned some of them back but see
[1:06:12] that's why brother branham had to do the
[1:06:14] two things the elijah ministry had to do
[1:06:15] the two things turn us back to what to
[1:06:19] where we can understand that we need
[1:06:21] these things
[1:06:22] and then bring the headstone message
[1:06:26] not just bring a regular message that's
[1:06:28] right
[1:06:32] let's go to psalms 118. magicians get
[1:06:34] ready to come we'll read about three
[1:06:35] scriptures
[1:06:36] then we'll start on that this afternoon
[1:06:39] i will praise thee
[1:06:40] for thou has heard me in art become my
[1:06:42] salvation
[1:06:44] the stone which the builders refused
[1:06:48] which the builders refused
[1:06:52] it's become the headstone
[1:06:55] of the corner
[1:06:58] become the headstone they rejected him
[1:07:00] they killed him they cut him off
[1:07:02] but he came right back down here on the
[1:07:03] day of pentecost and started again
[1:07:06] to build his church back amen he had a
[1:07:09] church in the old testament they
[1:07:10] rejected him come out from under
[1:07:12] headship killed him actually
[1:07:16] this is the lord's doing it is marvelous
[1:07:18] listen has this become marvelous
[1:07:22] has this become a marvelous message or
[1:07:24] is it just something that we do
[1:07:26] and it's something to say well i got
[1:07:28] something that that guy don't have over
[1:07:29] there no you're wrong
[1:07:31] you're like the pharisee that stands up
[1:07:33] and says lord i'm gonna pray so loud
[1:07:37] that he'll drown that old guy over there
[1:07:38] out he's just a center he don't
[1:07:41] look at him
[1:07:43] and now and like jesus said look look
[1:07:46] there he is over there on his knees
[1:07:47] crying out to god for forgiveness
[1:07:50] okay
[1:07:51] ephesians 2 verse 19 says now therefore
[1:07:53] you are no more strangers than
[1:07:54] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[1:07:57] saints and of the household of god
[1:08:00] now that puts you in the body
[1:08:03] and are built upon the foundation
[1:08:06] of the apostles and prophets jesus
[1:08:08] christ himself being the chief
[1:08:10] cornerstone listen he lowered himself
[1:08:12] down
[1:08:16] he lowered himself down
[1:08:20] to be the head of the corner what the
[1:08:23] head of this new race the head of this
[1:08:25] new church that was coming
[1:08:28] and they had their mistakes
[1:08:30] he went he had to wink at luther smoking
[1:08:32] a pipe and drinking beer but he said
[1:08:34] luther you preached just i lived by
[1:08:36] faith that's what i want you to preach
[1:08:38] because the people are going to get that
[1:08:40] right
[1:08:42] then he moved to wesley
[1:08:45] okay
[1:08:46] now look
[1:08:47] in whom all the building
[1:08:50] fitly frame together
[1:08:55] dies

[1:09:11] it's in your flesh
[1:09:15] in whom ye also are builded together for
[1:09:18] a habitation
[1:09:21] of god
[1:09:26] this is my beloved son
[1:09:29] this is my beloved tabernacle
[1:09:32] in whom i am so pleased
[1:09:35] to dwell
[1:09:36] he's so pleased to dwell that he's going
[1:09:38] to
[1:09:41] see you for an eternity
[1:09:44] and not be ashamed
[1:09:46] the bible says it's not be ashamed to
[1:09:47] call his bro call him brother right see
[1:09:49] your brother
[1:09:51] listen there's not anybody going to get
[1:09:52] into that city bride

[1:09:57] here
[1:10:00] i mean really now outside the city he
[1:10:02] gives people eternal life and i was
[1:10:05] thinking about this other day you know
[1:10:06] we know that jesus is coming soon
[1:10:10] is everybody okay with that but it's a
[1:10:12] secret coming as a thief in the night
[1:10:14] listen when the world says jesus is
[1:10:16] coming on this day or coming on this
[1:10:18] forget it
[1:10:20] you and i are the only people
[1:10:22] we're just going to be caught away

[1:11:44] through maysville and come up to the
[1:11:46] house
[1:11:48] go to homer
[1:11:52] so i turned went to homer
[1:11:54] that's where june and i were raised
[1:11:57] i turned left on yonohoma road
[1:12:00] and i went by the place
[1:12:02] that we first got married
[1:12:05] a little trailer that we first lived mom
[1:12:08] and dad helped us clean that thing up
[1:12:09] and it was a pigsty
[1:12:12] right mom
[1:12:14] mama i think even gay
[1:12:16] we literally opened the doors this is
[1:12:18] how this is a story we literally opened
[1:12:20] the doors and took water
[1:12:22] and washed
[1:12:24] but i got it for a good deal
[1:12:26] it was just me and her we were so much
[1:12:28] in love it didn't matter if we lived in
[1:12:29] a cardboard box
[1:12:31] would have been a little rough but
[1:12:34] but we found this trailer and it was a
[1:12:36] mess but we cleaned that up and from
[1:12:37] that beginning
[1:12:39] 42 years
[1:12:42] 42 years
[1:12:44] oh yeah had our ups and downs no doubt
[1:12:48] but 42 years i drove by that place and i
[1:12:50] said god thank you
[1:12:53] that i met a woman
[1:12:54] that would put up with me number one
[1:12:57] i see go ahead go ahead sit there all
[1:13:00] [Applause]
[1:13:03] but could put up with me for 42 years
[1:13:06] but think about god
[1:13:09] god remembers the first day
[1:13:11] you got born again
[1:13:14] the first day you said i want you god to
[1:13:17] be my husband
[1:13:20] it might have been in a little trailer
[1:13:21] it might have been a little shack
[1:13:22] brother brown said it may have been out
[1:13:24] in the middle of the swamp
[1:13:26] right
[1:13:27] but isn't that when you get married it's
[1:13:29] when you accept god in you in your life
[1:13:31] and it was a simple time we didn't have
[1:13:32] no kids we could just throw clothes in
[1:13:34] the car and go see her mom and dad and
[1:13:37] you know be there in in a couple a few
[1:13:38] hours and we'd just throw enough clothes
[1:13:40] and then when we started having kids it
[1:13:42] took like a week for us to decide we
[1:13:43] wanted to go and then another week to
[1:13:45] get everything ready
[1:13:46] and then six or seven days to get over
[1:13:48] there it was only a four-hour drive
[1:13:50] but you see how life is though life
[1:13:52] became a little bit complicated
[1:13:55] but still i go back and remember
[1:13:58] they sold the old trailer and put a
[1:14:00] double wide there and it's still there
[1:14:02] actually from the 40-something years
[1:14:04] since we lived there
[1:14:05] but i thought lord
[1:14:09] i'm horrible
[1:14:10] i was a horrible person
[1:14:12] when june and i got married but i loved
[1:14:15] her
[1:14:16] she loved me despite all the stupid
[1:14:18] stuff i did
[1:14:20] that's how god does
[1:14:22] he says i remember you when you were
[1:14:24] young
[1:14:26] i remember when i first
[1:14:28] went home with you
[1:14:31] we first built our christian experience
[1:14:33] together
[1:14:34] i remember that
[1:14:36] and i love it
[1:14:38] i've loved you from the beginning
[1:14:41] doesn't matter what you do
[1:14:43] you have your trials and tribulations
[1:14:46] and now 42 years later i know she's
[1:14:49] crying
[1:14:50] 42 years later
[1:14:52] we're still in love
[1:14:54] like little kids still in love why
[1:14:57] because now we got god in our life to
[1:14:59] tell us yes
[1:15:01] how to love
[1:15:03] you know listen you can have love out in
[1:15:04] the world and it becomes lust
[1:15:07] and all these different things but you
[1:15:08] can't have agape love of god
[1:15:14] and that world have anything to do with
[1:15:16] you
[1:15:20] and him also are building together for
[1:15:22] inhabitation
[1:15:24] see i built her a habitation it may have
[1:15:26] been a rough place at first when we
[1:15:27] first had to sweep it and clean it out
[1:15:29] and get all the roaches out but you know
[1:15:32] what it was home
[1:15:34] it was the house
[1:15:35] it was warm in the winter and no it was
[1:15:38] warm in the summer and cold in the
[1:15:39] winter pretty much
[1:15:41] i don't even know if the furnace worked
[1:15:43] but you know what that's your humble
[1:15:44] beginnings all of you has been that way
[1:15:46] i hope all of you can remember
[1:15:49] when you got married
[1:15:53] i hope you can all remember the day you
[1:15:55] got born again
[1:15:57] because it was way better than the day
[1:15:59] you got first married
[1:16:00] but you know what it parallels itself
[1:16:04] god
[1:16:07] said
[1:16:08] he'd build you a habitation
[1:16:12] he's going to dwell on you temporarily i
[1:16:14] say temporarily hang on a minute but
[1:16:16] your real home is that future home he
[1:16:18] built before the foundation of the world
[1:16:20] built according to your desires and it's
[1:16:22] somewhere in a dimension
[1:16:24] probably number seven i say it's in a
[1:16:26] dimension waiting to weaken what heaven
[1:16:30] and earth
[1:16:31] can kiss
[1:16:33] it's what we're looking for
[1:16:35] heaven and earth is kissed now between
[1:16:36] me and you and the bride you know the
[1:16:39] bridegroom jesus christ but there's
[1:16:41] going to be a literal time we're going
[1:16:42] to be able to walk with that man
[1:16:44] he's built us a house
[1:16:47] all those 42 years you and i walk
[1:16:49] together like i said trials and
[1:16:50] tribulations and troubles
[1:16:52] but she's my wife
[1:16:55] and that's just a
[1:16:58] pinhead
[1:17:00] that's just a molecule of water
[1:17:03] compared to the ocean
[1:17:05] that god's going to give us
[1:17:07] at the new birth
[1:17:09] but he's working in your flesh now
[1:17:13] we are now
[1:17:15] sons and daughters of god
[1:17:17] not only sons and daughters of god we're
[1:17:18] the bride of jesus christ
[1:17:21] and he's built us a place
[1:17:23] let's read this one thing you know you
[1:17:25] ought to go back sometime
[1:17:26] go back to where you were unless it's
[1:17:28] way off but just kind of go back and
[1:17:30] reminisce a little bit
[1:17:32] i know some people i had terrible
[1:17:34] marriage i'm sorry but
[1:17:36] think about the day you got born again
[1:17:39] now that the love of god came into your
[1:17:40] heart and you couldn't not love somebody
[1:17:42] else
[1:17:43] you just love everybody let's read
[1:17:44] second peter 1 3 and the musicians come
[1:17:46] on
[1:17:48] according as his divine power this is
[1:17:50] what we're going to get to this
[1:17:50] afternoon look look at all this work
[1:17:52] what is divine there's only one thing
[1:17:54] divine
[1:17:55] that's
[1:17:56] god
[1:17:58] nobody else is divine
[1:18:00] one divine according as his divine power
[1:18:04] has given unto us
[1:18:05] all things pertaining unto life and
[1:18:08] godliness through the knowledge of him
[1:18:10] that has called us to glory and virtue
[1:18:12] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:18:14] great and precious promises that by
[1:18:16] these you might be partakers
[1:18:19] of that divine nature
[1:18:21] having escaped the corruption
[1:18:24] like i said before that is in the world
[1:18:26] through
[1:18:27] lust
[1:18:29] there is no lust in agape love
[1:18:32] now filio love there's a lot of it but
[1:18:34] not in agape love there is not right
[1:18:36] musicians come
[1:18:37] we'll sing a song before we dismiss
[1:18:40] but just think about what god's done for
[1:18:41] you
[1:18:46] you truly get born again that's when you
[1:18:48] start living
[1:18:50] you're dead as a hammer until you get
[1:18:51] born again right you don't even know
[1:18:53] what you're doing amen that's why i drew
[1:18:55] you in the name of the lord jesus this
[1:18:57] year
[1:18:58] know that you know that you're born
[1:18:59] again because only the born-again is
[1:19:01] going in the rapture
[1:19:03] no one else let's stand our feet only
[1:19:05] the born-again is going in the rapture
[1:19:08] no one else

[1:19:15] i've seen him in the word
[1:19:17] i've seen pictures of him
[1:19:20] i've never felt him handed a hand
[1:19:23] oh we felt his presence
[1:19:25] but we're going to literally be with him
[1:19:28] whatever you do on this earth it it
[1:19:30] pales in comparison
[1:19:32] to what's coming we can have we can you
[1:19:34] know jen and i've had a good life we've
[1:19:36] had a a really good life
[1:19:38] and uh but it doesn't compare to what
[1:19:41] what if we were both just sinners though
[1:19:43] and we just loved each other with felio
[1:19:45] love and then we just went through the
[1:19:46] world had a couple kids and you know
[1:19:48] what then we just pass away that's it
[1:19:51] but no we got boarding in one day
[1:19:54] and that's an assurance of number one
[1:19:56] you're going to make it
[1:19:58] and it's also an assurance that we had a
[1:20:00] prophet thank god that says you'll be
[1:20:02] with that woman for the rest of your for
