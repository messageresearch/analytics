I'll entitled this enduring the work of the Potter and uh I uh was looking at some things and uh that word endure come came to my mind and uh I just want to look at that tonight so before we read thist scripture let's all bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for this day Lord we thank you for all your blessings upon us Lord Jesus that we're able Gather in your house again Lord and Lord we're just so thankful for all your blessings upon us Lord what a what a blessed people we are Lord we look to see the world's in growth Darkness Lord but you give us light to see Lord you give us Eyes saav Lord for our eyes Lord that we may see the day and hour which we live and Lord let us just be mindful of that and Lord let us be always about your business Lord Jesus and Lord we just pray that you come help us tonight as we look into your scripture father you just take these words Lord and put them together Lord I just stand here as a as a willing vessel this evening Lord Jesus Lord there's so many that have needs Lord we just pray that you come touch each one Lord all the ones that are sick and The Afflicted Lord there's so many and Lord the bride around the world pray that you bless the the five-fold ministry Lord as they as they labor and Lord we just so thank you for all that you've done for us Lord where would we be without you lord we just commit ourselves in all these things into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen am Jeremiah 18 verse1 says the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and go down to The Potter's House and there I will cause thee to hear my words then I went down to The Potter's House and behold he wrought a work on the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the Potter to make it then the word of the Lord came to me saying oh House of Israel cannot can I not cannot I do with you as this Potter sayith the Lord behold as the clay is in The Potter's hand so are ye in my hand oh House of Israel at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy it if that Nation against whom I have pronounced turned from their evil I will repent of the evil which I thought to do unto them and at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it if it do evil in my sight that it obey not my voice then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit them now therefore go to speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying thus sayith the Lord behold I frame evil against you and devise a device against you return ye now every everyone from his evil way and make your ways and your doings good in verse 12 says and they said there is no hope but we will walk after our own devices and we will everyone do the imagination of his evil heart amen God bless you may be seated tonight and uh just want to look at a a few things tonight and you know here in the in the scripture you know when when God tells Jeremiah to go to The Potter's House and he sees the work that was the Potter was working on the on the wheel was working on the clay and you know then he he turns to Jeremiah and he begins to speak and he was wanting them to to speak and he said go tell the you know the house of Israel that these are the things that I can do for you I can bless you or I can curse you but it's all about what you decide that was going to take place from this but you know he may he give them the opportunity give them the choice to make that they had the opportunity what was going to take place but God wanted them to know that he was there to bless them or to curse them because it laid before them whatever they decided that they were going to do that's what was going to take place but it's so amazing how he he sit there and he told him what was going to take place and you know you see so many times because in the book of Jeremiah we know that Jeremiah was the prophet that God came to and he began to talk to how the how the children of Israel had Israel had gotten away from God and you know he sent Jeremiah and Jeremiah keeps bringing coming back to the people to bring them back into the fellowship with God and bringing them back to the word and showing them where they're at and the condition that they're in and he keeps trying to bring them back to the same place and he keeps going back to them and keep bringing them back to this place and trying to show them that God had had something for them God wanted to bring them to a certain place but they did not want to and so many times is the grace of God that he kept going back back to him and and speaking to him because even here what is so amazing is as he brings this to the prophet and he tells him about all this but after he begins to tell them all these things and and you look through the book of Jeremiah how many times that God speaks to Jeremiah to go speak to the house of Israel and tell them the condition that they're in and what lays before them and then in the midst of all that in verse 12 they say there is no hope well it's the the grace of God that he kept coming back to you and pointing you back and telling you that you've left the you've left the word and I'm coming bringing you right back to the point and pointing you back to where you need to be and I'm it's well there there's no hope but we're just going to walk our own way why because many times when people get stuck in a situation they don't see the the full aspect they don't see the whole the whole picture they don't see the big picture of things and and you you begin to see how this thing lays out you know because here's Jeremiah and he and he sees this work that's being done on the wheel and as he begins to take this this uh whe this clay and he begins to work it and you know one of the things that people have a have an issue with and and you see that even in today's society the way things are people get to a place where you know they get stuck in in a situation they get stuck in a rut because it's like well it's always been this way it's always going to be this way and they don't see how things are ever going to change you know it's just like when when you look at the children of Israel when they were down in bondage and they spent 400 years in the land in bondage in Egypt and you see the condition they had a generation after generation living in bondage and all they had all they had ever seen because the because the ones that that had seen Joseph the ones that had seen the black blessings of God had seen the Miracles of God had seen all these things take place they were already gone but the only ones that ever saw that they that they talked about was what God done years ago but the only ones that they'd ever seen was the same people that lived the same life that they lived they still lived the same one why because they still lived under bondage they still still were beat and killed by the Egyptians they still had to go through the same ruts every single year and there was somebody that stood out there and told them that God was a good God God was a deliverer there was we are the children of Our Father Abraham and God made a promise to Abraham but there was a group of people that all they saw was the exact same thing every day was the same they fought the same battles they went through the same mud pits they went through all of the same thing they never saw anything different but there was somebody that kept telling them there is a a Deliverance to come there is there is a word that's been given to you but they did not see that and and that's the the reason why I want to talk about the word endure tonight because the problem was they didn't know how to hold on to what was given to them not to look at around what was around them but to hold on to the promise but you know what there was a group there was somebody that took took a hold of the word and did not look at what was around them because you know there was amram and Joseph B when they they was something about the word that laid upon their to pray for a deliverer why because when it came time for deliverance there was somebody that held on to the word and began to cry for that and then they began to pray that God would bring a deliver but then God used them to bring one and that and so you see how but people there's so many so many generations they were stuck in that same rut they didn't go beyond that why because they didn't see the long the long range Vision they didn't see the picture they just saw the mud pits they just saw the whips they just saw the death and the destruction but they didn't see the the promise and so here when we speak of Jeremiah speaking to the children of Israel see they had that same mentality all they see all they see is the same problems all they see is the same condition but what was but what was God showing Jeremiah Jeremiah was showing him this this clay I'm putting this Clay on the wheel and watch the work on the master look at the potter's wheel turning what was it it was the the clay lays there and it and it just goes around and around and around but what was it it's in the hand of the master it's in the hand of the Potter and so as it's going through this all it has to do is endure all it has to do is stay there on the wheel and as it turns and turns and turns well it doesn't see anything it nothing changes all it sees is the same mess but it doesn't see that it's in the hands of the Potter he doesn't say that it's in the hands of the Creator it doesn't see that it's exactly where God wants it to be it misses the place where it's at and what do we miss we've got just just to endure that's what we got to do is endure just like the the clay just stays there all the way through the scripture we find so many people they miss God but all God wants you to do is be right where he wants you to be see the word word endure means to continue in the same state it's saying it means to remain firm under suffering or Misfortune without yielding it means to undergo especially without giving in it means to regard with acceptance or tolerance see you stand just continue in the same state that you're in because if God's brought you to a place and you're praying so Lord I don't know why I'm I'm here well then if God brought you to a place then you know what God will lead you on well then you stay right where God laid you where God's placed you because you know as as the children of Israel he give them the cloud by day and the pillar of Fire by night he led them they had a sign to move that's right well you know what you have a sign to move also by the word the word will tell you what to do the word has G been given to us so stay in the place that he placed you remain firm well I I'm here but I don't know if I should go I well I I don't know be firm be be settled on what God's called you to to the place God's called you to be settled there so you're there and what do you so when God brings you to a place and you set someplace you're here he like well I don't know why things happen the way they do and you and you see the conditions that you're in but you know what just stay there be settled and endure to undergo the things that God wants you to go through so you're going through these things and it says to accept or to to tolerate so God's called you to this place so you stay here and you you go through the you endure these things now we don't always understand why things happen the way they do but we have a promise in the scripture that all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord who are the called according to his purpose so we know that there is a way that God brings us about that God wants us here that's right so when when you're when the clay is on the on the wheel that's the reason that the the scripture says you know the Potter can't say to the the clay can't say to the Potter why'd you make me this way because we because we're questioning God we don't even see the big picture we don't see what's taking place now he has so here's Jeremiah looking at the potter working upon the the the wheel the clay on the wheel and it says that as as the clay is laying in the hands of the Potter and it's turning and he does what he see what he thinks is good for the clay but in the midst of this the scripture tells us that the clay is marred in the hands of the Potter as it's sitting on this clay we see that it says then it's marred well when you go back and you begin to look at this there's two there's two different thoughts that come up from this number one we see that one time when you see that the when the Potter is working the clay there is something in the clay that shouldn't be there so there is a blemish or or something that that is uncooperative something that shouldn't be there and so he has to work it to get that out right and so there's something there that is that as as the clay is being worked there's something that lays there that only The Potter Knows is there and by the working of the Potter it comes to manifestation and when it becomes when it works out and it becomes to into the manifestation they realiz oh we got to get that out and sometimes which something that's that's always been there it's always laid there as brother bisc said you know we give that human grab bag there's a lot of things that we inherited that we don't like but you know what there's things in our lives that that you know we didn't we didn't have no control over it just ended up and you can't do nothing about it you can't you can't add one cubic to your stature you can't add any more hair well you you can you you go to Bosley spend a lot of money but you can't add any more hair to your head I mean there are artificial ways of doing things but you can't add any more hair you can't do these things now you can go to the store and you can buy some products and you can change your hair color back but you got to keep doing that there ain't there ain't no way that you're going to have some way that you that you can just wash it all out and it never comes back why because there's so many things why because that you inherited these things it's part of the human condition you know there's so many times in our lives you know because we we all have our different personalities and different things and you know there's things I I wish I could change it I can't change there's things and you know and you pray and pray and pray and you know what you wake up the next morning and you look at yourself in the mirror and you're still going back through the same thing how me you know because you know sometimes you get up and you say something and you're just like and it's like why did you say that why in the world did you say that and like and you and then you know what you you go a week a month whatever and you say it again and it's like well if you can't nothing good to say don't say nothing at all and you know what but I got an opinion it's like fire shut up in my bones I got to let it out and then sometimes when we let it out then it's like Lord forgive me that's right amen and we got to go pro go tell somebody I'm sorry if I offended you by what I said why because it's just human it's human nature it's who we are how many time how many times and some people are like man you know because they're just quick on the trigger there and other people they sit around like man I wish I was like that I wish I could just say things when I think them and it's like well some times you wish you were you you were wish you were you'd be glad you are like that cuz other people you know they just so quick to just fire it off and then and it's like but you know some people like boy I'd love to give a peace of my mind but you know what when when I'm in that situation I don't think about it it's when I'm away from it and I'm driving down the road it's like boy if I was back there I'd tell them this and that well sometimes you know thank the Lord that the Lord didn't you know your the the clutch was engaged and your mind wasn't running you didn't have you don't have to apologize about that but you know we all go through those things we all face those situations and we wonder why why because it's part of our human nature We inherited these things but what is it it's something that's there but as we go through things in life it begins to bring those things out and as those things become come in the Forefront you know then the Lord begins to deal with us about those things there's many people that that's had issues with anger and you know because it's taking years for them to get to the place that they get over that there's things that happen that you know we we just inherit it it's the way it's the way things are and the other the other set other school of thought that when you begin to look at this is things happen to you that you don't have any control over that you'll go through because the Potter does something to the clay and all of a sudden this happens and then all of a sudden well you know everything was going so good you know everything everything was smooth sailing I just everything looked so good I don't and all of a sudden you know I don't know what happened but you you look at you look at the life of Job here's job and and and God is speaking to the devil and tells him have you considered my servant job there's none like him and all of the earth well you know because you got a hedge around him let me mess with him for a while let my let me get my hands on him I want I'll show you but you know here here's job he wanted to be right before God he had he had the right attitude he had the right mentality he wanted to serve God with all his heart but you know what God allowed things to come in Jo life that he didn't have any control over but you know the scripture says that job never charged God foolishly for what he went through when he went through all with all the destruction and losing his family and everything everything is gone then then job's up there saying the Lord gives and the Lord takes away there was something that was added into the clay that he had no control over but when he went through that he didn't worry about it when everybody come to him and and said what have you done job we know that you're a secret sinner what have you done you know now we're now we're going to start combing through your life with a fine tooth comb find out what your problem is but you know he was right in his heart because he like well I don't know of anything and he began to speak to but the Lord went brought him through that to bring him to the place just like the Potter when he went through all of these things then he took the the clay and he was able to remod it into a vessel see has he as the the vessel is being the clay is being turned see there's something that takes place in the Potter in the clay that he begins to work it the clay doesn't have any control over it doesn't understand but the Potter does the the Potter knows what he's doing as as the clay is being turned the Potter begins to make manifest what's in his mind it becomes to be manifest see there's there's why because when people wonder why when when they go through experiences and different things that happen you know they they wonder why why why are all these things happening to me why because it's and when when you go through certain things it's hard to find the good in it right especially when the devil Center I got a package for you what here you go worry self-doubt all the other things here's a special book look at all the good things we got for you bud why because it's hard to walk by faith it's it's hard it's it's easy to walk by faith when everything's going good when you can't hardly take a step it's hard to walk by faith then feels like you're going one step forward and two steps back but those experiences and what makes you it's what brings you to the place see and when the when the Potter is working the clay see it takes while you have to endure you know because there is no Quick Fix In God there you won't find a getrich quick scheme brother John will be expounding on that more and more as as he's went and done a fine job up till now we've really been blessed by that but you know what it takes time it t it takes you have to go through this and it and it's hard yeah you know because it's easy to fall in a hole right but it takes a lot of work and sometimes it takes a little strategy to get out of it but many times people will fall in a hole and they'll sit there and it's like what I I don't I don't know what I'm going to do well when you hit rock bottom there's there's an old saying when you hit rock bottom there's only two ways to go straight up and sideways but you know what you start making a you start making a plan it's like there's a fell fell in and he could he figure out well you know what I can't go up but you know what he figured out he' go sideways he began to dig and the dirt that he was digging out was going underneath his feet and he kept digging and he kept putting more dirt under his feet and he kept digging and more dirt was under his feet well he wasn't going straight up but he was going out and it took him a it took him a while but you know what he figured out he could get out but he just didn't sit there and like what what am I going to do well you know I might as well just sit here and die or I'm just going to sit here and wait for somebody to come by and help me out and sometimes that's what God wants to see you know there's something that you can do so well because I have you know there there's so many things that that people go through in life and you know you you try to help people and you know you you you see there's so many things that that have happened to people and I was I was thinking the other day when I was looking at this and I had a friend of mine is he's a good friend and he used to go to church and you know you you want to help people but you know you've got to have an experience for yourself and the one thing you you've got you got to want to change you've got you've got to have the desire to go forward you it's got to be within you he was he was a a a a very very nice guy I I I loved him I love him but you know he went to church just a denominational Christian he just he's just a real good guy they had two children they lost they lost the youngest one the child was born with health defects unbeknownst to them it end up having problems and it was taken more rapidly than they expected it to he never come he never come to grips with that he knew in the back of his mind his son wouldn't grow up but when he went faster than he was able to prepare himself for when the child passed he was just stuck in a rut he couldn't he couldn't go beyond that that's where he was at in life now he liked to cut up and laugh and everything but there was a wound inside of him that he couldn't get past and I talked to him numerous times but you know that was one day I was I was talking to him and you know we we talk about different things but one day the Holy Spirit came down and I began to speak to him and I told him I said your problem is you're still mad at God you're still mad at God because he took your son but I said God's here to heal you see that's part of the human condition life and death we don't have any control over that but you know we go through these things and we don't understand God's plan but I told him I said listen you got to get ready I said you're still mad at God you can't move beyond that but God wants to heal you of that he wants to deliver you of that and I told him I said listen David said when when he had a child that was dying because of his own sin and he laid out there before God over that child and he laid out there all those days and he pleaded with God over that child and that child died but you know what David didn't lay out there on the ground any longer he didn't wallow in his in his tears any longer but when when he found out that the child was dead because he was there and he saw the servants talking and he said as the child passed and they they said yeah but then he said he got up and he washed himself and he anointed himself and he went and ate he went back to living Y and they said David why is it that now now you're out living life when you're not pleading for God he said why because while that child was alive he said I could plead for God and maybe he'd do something but he said now this child has passed on and he said I can't do anything about it he said the child has gone from me but David said the one thing that I can do is prepare myself to go where that child is and I told him said said you've got to do the same thing let me tell you something there's a day that you're going to have to give an account for God you can hold on to this thing and it's going to eat you up but there is a holy spirit here the spirit of the Lord is here to deliver you from that and bring you to a place that you can overcome that because you've got to get ready to go where that child is if you want to see your child [Applause] again that's what God wants us to do realize when we go through the hardest the hardest times in our lives and we Face these hard things there's a there's a plan that God has a plan for us there is a purpose behind that you know when when brother brandham was standing there and he and he was talking about losing hope and and sharing Rose and he was standing there and he said Lord you sheared me once he said Shear me again why because he didn't he didn't find the joy in all of that but he saw the goodness of God in that he saw the purpose in that there was something that was doing something for him there was that was to for him amen so you we go through these things we don't understand why these things happen but there's a plan and a purpose behind these things so we see all the the things that happen in life you know we we we want to go through certain things and we want to bypass certain things in life but you know there's no bypass in them you're going to have to go through these things you're going to have to go through the you're going to have to endure these things you know I I I was thinking of of brother baman when he was telling the story of the of the couples that he married you know he Mar he married this couple that you know they they had everything in the world that they could ever want both of their dads were multi-millionaires that had everything in the world anything everything was on a silver platter had everything you could think of but what was it they weren't happy they were out fussing and fighting and arguing and you know it's so amazing because even if brother brandham didn't you know he said well I walked up there and I I saw they were off there arguing they like and they told Brother oh yes we're we're very happy he's like well even if brother brandham didn't hear you fussing and arguing you know brother bram's a prophet you know he's got discernment so you know he he knew what y'all were doing before he got there it wasn't like like y'all even if he never heard nothing it wasn't like he didn't know what was going on but here they here they are going oh yes we're we're very happy no they're not got everything in and in in the world you can think of everything everything materially they were blessed but you know what they are both both of them jealous of each other got got their own little issues Petty things yeah and he said he went down there and had that little boy that didn't have two nickel to rub together had that little girl I think she was barefooted they come down there wanted to get married didn't have anything here they are and then and and nothing in this world but love and here they are they they get and they come down there brother Bri talks to them and said you know what are you going to do well I'm I'm going to do the very best that I can sir going to work and make her a living and it's like well you know if he loses his job and everything goes south what are you going to do young lady I'm going to stay right with him I'm not going back to Mama I'm going to endure this brother brand said he went down there by the river they living in a rail car ain't got nothing go down there but you know what she's sitting in his lap and they're they're in love they why because you know they they're working together you know he wants to do things for her and she's like well honey I don't need these things yeah but I want to do something for you why because they're on the same page realizing that they're trying to work together they're trying to make a life together they're trying to face the same things but you we see we see in today's world how everything is is you know you know everything is always backwards and upside down way people are now and you know it's like you know they come out there the these girls were talking and and it was on Tik Tok or something other and they were standing there like you know I'm looking for somebody that's 6 foot tall makes six figures and all this and it says well what do you bring to this uh relationship what do you I'm bringing me he's like so you're you're looking for a fine looking six six foot tall man to make six figures and you think he's going to take you he needs a woman like that like he needs another hole in his head well y'all can laugh not say Amen if you want to it's the truth but that's but that's the condition that the world's in what because there there's there's no working together when you know because you see people today they they get and you know it's like well I you know I won't I wanton the moon I want this I want that like listen you're going to get married and you ain't going to have nothing unless you win the lottery or something you know I mean because everybody thinks well you know what well mom and daddy lives a certain way and they have a certain well you know what your Mom and Daddy has has slaved and worked and labored for 40 years to get there but nobody sees where your Mom and Daddy had to do without yeah come on when they when they when they've had to go when they've had to swallow their pride sometimes to go through things to make it but you got kid but you got people today and they wonder why why why the the marriage rate is the way it is and the divorce TR is the way it is today why because there is there is no working together there is no getting on the same page well I tell you the first thing that a lot of problems is that they have today is number one is they're not Christians because you know what they want to run everything do everything without God we don't have to have God in none of it you wonder why it falls apart but they wonder why but it's the same thing that because they don't want to put any time into it they don't want to put any effort into it because you know they say well you know it's all about having 5050 no it's 100% because you know what if you don't give 100% And your spouse don't give 100% then you know what it ain't going to work it takes it take why because there's lots of times it takes a great big sea of forgetfulness it it takes a lot of forgiveness why because there comes a time you've got to put the things in the past in the past and not live back there amen but you know what the problem is is we let the devil run around with the great big mirror and hey look see behind you you see that we're not looking in the as brother Lise said we're looking in the mirror of the word if we look in the mirror at the word if we're looking in the word and we see ourselves in the word and then we begin to change that Lord let me change what what I see in the word that I become more like the word because you know there's you because some girl's going to marry some guy it's like well you know I'm going to change him good luck with that what do they say women want to marry some guy that she can change and some guy wants to marry a girl that hoping she never changes why because because they have but they have their own way about things and they and they fail to realize but you know what it takes it takes a work we'll be praying we'll be praying have a prayer line after after this service [Laughter] today there's a bomb in Gilead but it t but it takes work working together because people well you know you know because you know you you read all these fairy tales and and all of these love stories and everything like that here's the love story that you read get into the scripture and see you know what there's going to be hardships there's going to be things that the battles and the stresses and the struggles are going to be there and you can think well I think I think I can handle it I think I can handle it well sometimes you start getting into problems and things and struggles in your marriage and things happen in life in family life and you're like oh lord it's like I wasn't expecting this but that's what God wants you to do see you got to come through these things but you've got to endure but God wants you to realize that you are equipped to handle this God has brought you to the he wants you to understand these things that's right see we understand that when you have a a family you get married and you're going to have children and you know what husband wife sometimes everything you're different as as daylight and dark and you know because some oh everything's so wonderful everything's just one comes together and then it's it's to like two opposing magnets you just you can't get together on nothing but that's part of the that's part of the enduring that's part of the growing and then Richard Richard where's Richard at Richard always tells I'm I'm going to say this Richard always says when I get up here I always preach on him but I told him I said well if you was a preacher you get up here and preach on me but I get to tell the stories how I want to tell them there you go there's Richard's version and and there's the truth so cuz I don't remember a lot of things he says that happened but but my memory is a lot better than his you just you can test us on that but you know you go through things and I always tell Richard I was like just remember you're going to have to pay for your raisin you're going to pay for your raisin and he and he has God bless God blessed him with a son and uh I love Thomas to death but they Richard tells me things about Thomas and I was like sounds familiar sounds familiar sounds familiar I may I may have to I may have to ride just get out of here right after church just run I may not make it to the car huh that door yes when we start to pray you'll hear me I'm going to grab all my stuff and I'll start making my way to the door but you know you you see these things and you start having children and all of a sudden the things that you don't like about yourself is the things that ends up in your children and you know all of a sudden the these uh this attitude and all these different things that that you go through and all of a sudden there's a mini me facing you well my dad told me I had I had two boys and dad said I had one that looked like me and I had one that acted like me and I'll let y'all try to figure that that one out but you know you you see these things and all of a sudden it's like surely my surely I wasn't this bad surely surely this this this this it's a lie it's a lie it never never never was like this but what is it all of a sudden there that's that's way the Devil he's going to attack your family get right in there and he's going to be right in there he's going to meddle and you got and you know because fathers and husbands we the head of the house as Truman as President Truman said the buck stops here that's where the buck stops and nobody and nobody wants to listen to daddy sometimes I'm I'm G preach tonight whether y'all like it or not I may have to walk home tonight but I'm going preach I love I love my family I love my wife but you know they don't I may I may sleep on the couch I don't know sleep outside I don't know we may have we may have all night prayer meting you never know love covers a multitude of sins abely the couch is comfortable Amen brother but you know you see all these things that you have to go through you've got a struggle it's a it's a job you've got to you've got to put and work through that you've got to be the standard for the family what you know because brother R was talking about the in the age in which we live all the wealth and all of all the Wonder the fineries that we have in this world and you know now they they have this thing where you know they they want to just uh take something go home here's your tablet and we won't you know we want YouTube and Elon Musk or whoever else out there you know you know they're going they're going to teach you going teach your kids and you wonder why kids end up with the thoughts and ideas why because the world is set up because it's all satan inspired and it starts as soon as they get a conscious thought it's through that that those seeds are being swn into your children and if you don't teach your children they're going to end up with a whole bunch of garbage sewed into them that's the reason why you see all these kids they they they've never darken the door of a church they they they don't they know more about Pokemon and all kinds other then they know anything about the Bible right you know it's just like you you meet people I was talking to a lady one time she grew up Jewish and uh she she had actually went to a Jewish school and she couldn't tell me a half dozen of the of the it's like well we learned all this stuff she couldn't tell me a half dozen of the of the sons that were born of Jacob he said now what what how was that Abraham Isaac Jacob you know Joseph Benjamin Ruben isachar manasse you know all the all the sons that were born there you know it's like oh yeah and there's another one his name's Levi it's where the Levites came from you know here they they go all this stuff and you know but what do they do church church is going to going to church and you know playing rock and roll music and and then what we going to do we're gonna go out and you know we're going to go outside and have water balloon fights and you know all kinds of other stuff and not not one not one thing is taught that has to do with the word of God they don't know the first thing about the Bible don't know the first thing about anything it's just whatever whatever you whatever whatever you think is good and why is it it's just whatever whatever their their moral code is is and that and that's and that's we just come church and and we we we just went and had her had her showing and then we left and brother BR talking about the condition that the world is in and you know that they they they want to have this little bit and he says and he was talking about the he said about the Ed he said but they expect this little time spent by the children in the educ ational plant to take the place of the hours of training supposed to be given in the home because there's there's no because there's no Mom there's no dad years ago I heard a guy and he was talking about H raising kids and he said he said the people that are raising kids nowadays is Axel Rose and mad and from y'all from from the 80s would know who that is right that's from our generation I guess I guess nowadays I I say it's Taylor Swift or whoever else but they think that's but but but you know what but brother R said it takes hours of training at home and you know what and and I'm I'm the first one to say you know I'm short on that I'm lacking because you know it's it's not it's not just talking about it it's actually taking the time when you're so busy and everything else and the world just spinning all around you it's like hey we got to put brakes on this we got to stop this we got to slow this down and we got to make time for it you got to take time to pray with your kids talk to them about things right you know the the times that we've we've done the uh the quizzes The Listening to brother benham's messages you know sometimes we've had problems trying to get through the trying to get through the sermon we began to listen to them the next thing you know there comes a discussion and we try to get through it's like well let let's let's try no then all of a sudden we you know because we're answering questions because one of the boys I have one question and what about about this and what about that and all a sudden it's like okay well you know we're not going to finish the tape today because you know what we're going to answer questions but it's good that they have questions that something that Peaks their interest it's nice when they come and ask you questions about things because you know it's like you know you want to teach them and you want to try to tell them what's right and try to help them amen I got I got two boys and I it's like you know the one thing I know real good is air conditioning and you know I Levi Levi can do it he does don't well now I think he's now he's getting paid now since he's got a job I think he's he's more into it now but but you know you try to teach them something and you know all of a sudden you just see their eyes glaze over it's like the lights are on but nobody's home but you know you're trying to you're trying to but you know what if they don't you all you gotta do is put it in front of them you can't you can't force it but you know if you just lay it before them and then you know and then if they if they decide they going to take it then they'll take it but you you just lay it before them and let them let them see if they're going if they want to do anything with it or not amen and it's like you know I I I like to you know in my job you know i' I've you know new people have come in you just put something in front of them and see if they can fix it or not or make it mess it up or figure out anything and I've had the boys do the same thing here and they just I mean they they they look at you know like like they old saying about a calf looking at a new gate they just stare at it like but you know what I mean at times they' done they've done real well I've been really proud of them really really impressed but you know it you just got to put it in front of them and you say sometimes you go through and you're talking to them and and you think they're just in church and you know they're they're dozing or whatever they're doing this or that but sometimes you know what they're listening you think they're not but occasionally you know I I've had the boys and all of a sudden they they come by and all of a sudden they begin to talk about things all a sudden they bring things back it's like wow you were listening you know I always told everybody ad Adams Adam was always my preacher Adam Adam's always been my preacher because you know there's been times over the years I'd preach something and Adam he next thing you know he's out he's out sharing it with everybody I preached a message one time about being clothed in his right and not being found naked Adam he started going around to everybody said do you know that we're all naked in the sight of God did you know that that if you're not clothed in his righteousness you're naked and it was like you know what that's an amazing way of bringing that out and people are like what kind of church you go to exactly but you know what it brings them to a realization that they're not where they need to be if you're not if you're not in him if you're not clothed in his righteousness then you are you will be found naked wretched miserable blind and naked and brother R said you don't know it what a condition to be in but you see the condition that the world is in see we go through all these things and we have to face all of these hard problems and and testing and we don't want to go through these things but God has a plan for us you know I was thinking of brother R when he was talking about you know six second Smith you know brother Bram want to be a boxer he's like you know I'm going to be a well 6 second Smith told brother brandom he said Bill if you going to be a you going to be a boxer you know you just need to get ready and he about knocked he about knocked brother brandom out of the ring and and he was like uh why you trying to do this you know you trying to kill me he's like no I'm getting you ready he said when a man gets fit it stops his heart you got to prepare you got the only way the only way that you're going to be able to handle this is go through this experience get back in the ring and get just about get knocked out of it and get back in the ring but what was that he fought 15 fights yeah and never lost to one of them why he went through an experience now I'm sure I'm sure that he was out there like boy I like that one give me some more yeah I'll take another one of them but you know what he endured that because he could see and especially the first time he got in the ring and got hit really hard and it took his breath and then all of a sudden it's muscle memory it's your training takes over why because he'd been through that he endured that he knew what to he knew what to expect he knew how to handle it and all of a sudden when it went through that like you that I can that I can react I can recover because if not he'd have got hi and just laid there why because it it takes you have to go through things you know there was a there was a man that was a he was a Marine in in uh Vietnam and he was talking about the lieutenants that they had over there and the in the platoon and everything like that and they said you know some some lieutenants when they when they LED their their companies or their or or squads I believe it's companies that they have when they would let them through there and he's like you know they had they had some of them were hard and rigid and tough on them he said they go through a certain time change your socks they go through this you do this you go through that you go through and he said some of them they would not I like well listen if you want to change your socks go ahead what happens if you don't change your socks you end up what they call trench foot you get infection in your feat and next thing you know you can't walk and you know what if you got half your men and you're in the middle of the jungle somewhere and you got the enemy coming at you and half of them can't run or walk you're all sitting ducks but you know what he done that because he was like well you know what the they they just want to be their buddies they just want to take they just want to be their friends you know what if you're not hard because there was a reason why they were that way because not only did it did it affect those men it affected him can you imagine going out there and those men not being equipped to do the job that they were called to do and you're leading them and you're the reason why they're not equipped to do the job and they're out there and you're seeing those dead those men's bodies laying on the ground and you're the sole reason why they're there why because you want well you I just want to take it easy on them no that didn't that didn't help them at all that's right and it's the same way with while while when we have a Ministry well when when the when the ministers get up there and they begin to say things and and and get on our cases about things like are we going to hear this again well you know what if You' get past it if you do what you told you it would be a problem but you know it's if keeps coming up there's probably a reason why like brother talking about that man preaching to they said well brother we're enjoying these sermons where we keep hearing you preach on the same thing about repentance he said well when everybody repents I'll move on to something else but we're going through this why because you've got to endure these things what brother say that that the trial he said he said that's what God gives the church he said it's he said he gives you trial after trial test after test trial after trial he said until the Life of Christ is reflected in your life am he said until you become Peaceable peaceful sober Meek gentle humble ready submissive willing turn your head from the things of the world and looking straight to Calvary to the one who's doing the beating amen when you go through all these things when he brings you through all that we don't see we don't always see what God wants us to see but you know what he's there and he's working and he's molding it into His Image what he wants it to go through you see all the ones you know there's there's Paul what a great man here's Paul going you know all all the things Fise of the Pharisees all the you know all all the checks all the boxes of his pedigree right all the things that he had been through man look at me I counted all this dung right brother I've been through there had all of this training I knew the word back forwards everything but you said you know it didn't count me didn't do me one bit of good I don't count it as one thing but you know he brother BR said he had to go three and a half years on in the back side of the desert in Arabia there take three and a half years God took the word that he held and he began to open it up and it began to show him the scriptures and he began to see all these things all the all those years of him studying and all this and all of a sudden the Lord began to open up and began to see all these things what an amazing thing that then all of a sudden here's Paul and he said you know he said I'd be counted a curse for my breth and S if they could see this that you know this this is for this is what I want them to see that that we are the ones that God has blinded their eyes that we the Gentiles may see those those that are considered uncircumcised the circumcision and not realizing that we are the circumcised God blinded their eyes that we might be brought in that we can see these things I counted all as dung that I might win Christ that all the things that I suffered you think of of of Paul's all the things that he went through all the things that he suffered all the things he had to go through he said you know count it all joy when you go through all these things amen it's a it's a joy yes you endure but we live in you know we live in a in a world now that you know people people don't understand how to endure don't understand it you know the scripture talks about uh in in the last days in uh in Mark he talks about you know when when the word being sown and the and the word being sown Jesus telling about the the parable of the SE and he said this the word was being sown and he said it fell on Stony ground there and he said all of a sudden you know they rejoiced and and they were they were happy for a while they endured for a while here they are but he said he said then all of a sudden they they it's it's it's a it's a um what's the word it's a catchphrase today it's a buzz word they were offended they were offended and they dried up up why instead of enduring all of a sudden they they become offended and not realizing what God was doing and was was a was a scripture tell us that in and and U later on uh Jesus was speaking there and he was talking about how um you know false Christ would arise and he said he said because those are offended he said they'll turn against each other in the last days why because there's not there's not those that are going to endure why because they're going to be offended but he said but he said he that endureth shall be saved he that endures to the end shall be saved there's a group that's going to endure to the end see God has us on the Wheel amen and we're being in the hands of the Potter that he is molding us into His Image he's making us into His Image amen amen have the musicians come this evening but that's what God wants us to do he wants us to be in his hands we see the we see the let's all stand with the condition that the world is in it's a late hour but thank God I know I'm in the hands of the Potter mold me Lord make me more like thee Jesus make me more like thee just as the the Potter has control of the of the clay is able to mold it and just in endure the scripture says my son despise not the chastening of the Lord when you go through the and but you know if you endure that's what God wants you to do endure because if you can endure you can see you can be what God want you to be to be a vessel of Honor that's what God wants to make of each one of us Lord Make Me end of that amen God bless you let's sing a song creating me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me oh yeah create in me a clean heart oh God [Music] and renew a right Spirit Within
