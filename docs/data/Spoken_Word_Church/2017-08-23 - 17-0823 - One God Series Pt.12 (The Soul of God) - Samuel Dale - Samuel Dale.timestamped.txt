[3:09] like to anything 16 okay all right let's
[3:14] get in our scripture then father we
[3:16] thank you for your grace and your love
[3:19] and your understanding thank you for all
[3:21] things and we just ask you that you
[3:24] would just be with each and every one of

[3:45] from all unrighteousness and may we walk
[3:48] in you we love you and we thank you in
[3:50] Jesus name Amen
[3:55] we've been reading John I said we will
[3:59] get to that part because remember now
[4:03] that we're been talking and we read in
[4:06] John in the beginning but remember that
[4:09] beginning there is not it just means a
[4:13] point or something when something begins
[4:16] to be able to be made known it's not a
[4:20] beginning you know like you've got a
[4:23] beginning of it or some starting point
[4:26] it just means something is there because
[4:29] if not then where would you do it in the
[4:31] beginning was the word and the Word was
[4:34] with God but now what and the Word was
[4:38] God saying now you're right back to the
[4:41] one true and living God and do it and
[4:43] the same was in the beginning with God
[4:45] so there's no beginning like we talked
[4:48] about beginning it's the words we use in
[4:51] terminologies all right all things were
[4:55] made by him and without him was not
[4:57] anything made that was made
[4:58] in him was life and the life was a lot
[5:01] of men and like shyness and darkness and
[5:04] the darkness comprehended it not now
[5:07] let's go over to Ephesians and try to
[5:12] pick up the thought from there from
[5:15] Sunday and carry it on into the right
[5:19] understanding okay verse 25 for David
[5:25] speak of concerning him I foresaw the
[5:27] Lord always before my face for he is on
[5:29] my right hand and I should not be moved
[5:32] therefore did my heart rejoice in my
[5:34] tone was glad moreover also my flesh
[5:37] shall rest in hope because that will not
[5:39] leave my soul in Hell neither wilt thou
[5:42] suffer thine Holy One to see corruption
[5:48] let's stop there because we're going to
[5:50] another part of the thought but remember
[5:52] the thing we're talking about tonight
[5:53] because I will not leave my soul in Hell
[5:56] neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One
[5:59] to see corruption you may be seated
[6:02] Lord that is blessing to the reading of
[6:05] the word now I've tried to bring out the
[6:09] thought Sunday afternoon or Sunday
[6:12] morning rather and trying to fit
[6:15] together what I've been driving at for
[6:18] the longest and trying to bring the
[6:20] point of showing that what I believe now
[6:24] I've always tried to express one thing
[6:28] to you
[6:28] I believe in eternal life all right I
[6:35] believe that God always was eternal I
[6:40] believe that his life is the life we
[6:43] must receive to make us eternal all
[6:47] right before because of the fallen
[6:50] condition we'll get back to Adam which
[6:53] started it out but we'll see how the
[6:55] fall came and to that I know we've got
[7:00] quotes you've got things you've got
[7:01] people that believe all corners of
[7:03] doctrines about pre destinations and in
[7:07] eternal you know and L say oh I come
[7:10] here with eternal life the prophets that
[7:12] I did well all right but the Prophet
[7:17] also said you were born in sin shapen in
[7:20] iniquity spouse form up from your
[7:22] mother's womb and come forth the liar
[7:25] doom and on the way to hell now you're
[7:29] gonna say one's right and one's wrong
[7:31] what are you gonna say that's just the
[7:34] point that I'm making to you as to think
[7:37] about things that you read and study we
[7:42] studied the Bible we went to church we
[7:45] done all kind of things
[7:47] and we still had a Trinity we still had
[7:52] three gods or a garden three persons for
[7:55] whatever has it changed very much then
[7:59] you know
[8:01] from believing it that way as to coming
[8:04] to some other form to bypass that and
[8:07] get up and come further in now oh I
[8:09] always was eternal well well then if he
[8:15] was why do you have to receive eternal
[8:17] life well I don't have to I already know
[8:21] I had it all the time well now go home
[8:24] and look in the mirror and you I mean I
[8:27] hope you have enough sense to know what
[8:29] that's staying you look in the mirror
[8:32] and you see yourself getting older and
[8:33] older then I wouldn't believe that I
[8:36] always was eternal well now it's not
[8:40] necessarily this that well okay now what
[8:42] part of it that's what we're going to
[8:44] deal with tonight we're going to deal
[8:48] with what part of you would have any
[8:54] opportunity whatsoever to think about
[8:57] being before the foundation of the world
[9:02] surely we would have enough plain common
[9:06] sense to know and realize that this
[9:08] flesh has nothing to do with eternity at
[9:13] this time it is deteriorating is failing
[9:17] away so surely we ought to be able to
[9:19] remove that part out of the situation I
[9:22] mean you can you can holler and scream
[9:25] all you want to and say that well I'm
[9:27] not no older and I was twenty years ago
[9:31] I'm like brother branham it said about
[9:34] it he said you lied and I didn't so that
[9:36] it's the best way to say it you know
[9:39] well I am I'm just as strong well okay
[9:42] give you about another twenty years and
[9:44] let's see what you say but the thing of
[9:47] it is we want to I look at things like
[9:51] this why is it that mankind I'm talking
[9:55] about the whole world I'm not talking
[9:57] just even the people of this message are
[9:59] you for me why is it of mankind all
[10:04] around the world that he's trying to
[10:07] find some Fountain of Youth
[10:12] he's trying to find his goal has been to
[10:16] find something who was it ponce de leon
[10:18] come all the way across America every
[10:20] what he did wound up in Florida trying
[10:22] to find the Fountain of Youth
[10:24] well we laugh and make fun of him but
[10:28] what about in the religious realm and
[10:31] what is it that we try to do in the
[10:34] religious realm try to figure out some
[10:37] reason some reason that I believe what I
[10:44] believe you know not some reason for
[10:52] thinking about the way we think what is
[10:55] our purpose what's our doing what what
[10:57] is our thoughts every religious part
[11:03] that there is in some one way or another
[11:05] preaches a happy hunting ground or a
[11:08] life after this or a thought you know or
[11:11] an idea and what is it
[11:18] what part of us in our human makeup is
[11:25] worth anything and I don't you know I
[11:32] make plain statements on as a scripture
[11:35] in a minute I want to get to it and read
[11:37] that it's been many years trying to
[11:39] understand why Paul would say what he
[11:41] has and see that's the way I look at
[11:44] things I come to the scriptures and I
[11:46] study them and I try to get to the bases
[11:50] as I see well this is what is being said
[11:51] now let me see what he's saying to me
[11:54] and what is this the scripture speaking
[11:58] to me you know and trying to show me the
[12:02] truth right let's see we've read the
[12:06] scriptures all the way through we
[12:09] studied the Bible well what kind of a
[12:12] concept did we come up with well how
[12:17] much more is it today like I said you
[12:21] could take quotes out of the Bible too
[12:26] prove your point you can take quotes and
[12:32] prove this or that or the other you can
[12:34] prove by your cons your way of thinking
[12:38] that there's three gods or no gods or
[12:40] how many gods are or one god or whatever
[12:43] they are you can do all of those things
[12:46] from your own thoughts but what good is
[12:49] it I say it for your benefit not mine if
[12:55] there is a god you mean to tell me that
[12:59] he cannot keep his word straight you
[13:03] mean he's so so hard about making sure
[13:11] that it stays straight did I remember
[13:15] when I first saw what the Scriptures he
[13:18] was the Prophet was bringing about that
[13:22] the Jews were promised the Messiah the
[13:27] Samaritans you know they would come in
[13:32] and they would look for the Messiah with
[13:39] the Gentiles no promise but yet come to
[13:45] find out I fir it's all finished after
[13:51] the whole Bible is finished to come to
[13:55] find out that the Gentiles were the ones
[13:58] he was seeking after because they would
[14:03] be the ones who would finish up his plan
[14:07] and purpose but yet they're not back to
[14:10] her as far as God appearing we get to
[14:14] our point is God made so sure that the
[14:18] Gentiles would get an opportunity until
[14:23] he brought the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[14:24] and brought it to a Gentile dispensation
[14:27] look like that would have been enough
[14:29] and you know what I'm talking about it
[14:33] was a Gentile it's a Gentile
[14:35] dispensation that's why it's called that
[14:37] now that means anybody can be so
[14:40] but it's not a Jewish dispensation it's
[14:43] a Gentile dispensation Nations it means
[14:46] anybody all right
[14:48] looks like that would be enough to
[14:50] fulfill the Scriptures that would be
[14:54] okay
[14:55] but yet God said no that's not enough he
[15:00] said I went to the Jews and showed them
[15:04] the signs and the wonders he said I went
[15:07] to the Samaritans and I showed him the
[15:10] things but a woman at the way holding
[15:13] them but said those Gentiles that all
[15:17] they've had is religion to deal with now
[15:20] I'm quoting your prophet huh
[15:23] but he wasn't gonna leave us with just
[15:25] religion and ideas he promised that he'd
[15:29] send a prophet to bring the message to
[15:35] give the Gentiles an opportunity to be
[15:39] just as equal as the other and an
[15:43] opportunity to receive him you
[15:44] understand what I'm saying
[15:46] and in doing that then he would spend
[15:50] all of the time bringing out the word to
[15:54] make sure it would fall into the right
[15:55] hands and be you know everything would
[15:57] be perfect to where you and I could have
[16:00] a message in the end time that it
[16:05] wouldn't just be now less than one say
[16:07] it
[16:07] the Jews got the signs and the wonders
[16:13] the Samaritan signs and wonders are
[16:17] discern what the things look what he's
[16:20] given to the Gentiles not only did he
[16:25] give the signs and wonders he gave us
[16:28] the word what a wonderful opportunity to
[16:34] be living in this last days to follow
[16:38] the Word of God okay so follow that
[16:40] doubt so I believe in eternal life I've
[16:43] tried to show it there Sunday but I
[16:47] don't believe you and I come with
[16:49] eternal life if we did why did Jesus
[16:52] Christ have to die
[16:53] well you just don't believe what the
[16:54] Prophet said that's alright you you
[16:57] think what you want to about me that's
[16:59] between you and God that it's none of my
[17:01] business but see you won't sit down and
[17:05] talk with me with the Scriptures in in
[17:08] the prophets message because see I
[17:11] believe the Prophet when he says you
[17:14] always was eternal but I believe right
[17:17] back above all of those quotes you'll
[17:18] find him saying if you have eternal life
[17:27] if you have eternal life - not that
[17:30] eternal I've always was eternal but
[17:36] there was a time that I wasn't eternal I
[17:42] had to receive eternal life to be able
[17:45] to have eternal life
[17:47] well so then what was back before the
[17:51] world God eternal life what I'm trying
[17:55] to say son dizzy ensuring that that was
[18:02] the part that was back there what the
[18:05] eternal life God imparted his own life
[18:11] to you and I so what would be back
[18:14] before the foundation world God Himself
[18:18] but in him he had attributes and the
[18:23] Prophet said we were a part of him and I
[18:27] had two quotes whether I gave him or not
[18:28] you heard it he said if he wasn't back
[18:31] there before the foundation of the world
[18:34] you never will be
[18:37] well then what was back there if we
[18:44] don't believe that we were back there
[18:45] his people what was back there we wasn't
[18:54] body wasn't spirit wasn't so probably
[18:58] said not her being here
[19:04] know what you see the key is to remember
[19:07] the one thing we must receive eternal
[19:14] life if we were born with it you're
[19:19] making the Bible a total well it's worth
[19:24] noting Jesus Christ come and died in
[19:30] vain and like I was trying to get you to
[19:34] see see people would say in the message
[19:36] well it was just I come in the message
[19:39] he found out I always was eternal within
[19:41] why didn't that do with Nicodemus if it
[19:46] was coming into the message to find out
[19:48] you always was eternal
[19:49] why was Nicodemus told you must be born
[19:51] again why do you need to be born again
[19:57] are you saying the born-again experience
[19:59] is a knowledge to you that you always
[20:03] was eternal we need a little bit more
[20:08] than that
[20:10] because that won't hold up in the Bible
[20:14] well brother the hell I just don't
[20:16] understand you I thought I was right
[20:19] until I've heard you preach well you
[20:21] know what that means there's something
[20:24] wrong what you thought it may not be
[20:28] wrong I didn't say that I just said
[20:31] there's something wrong with what you're
[20:32] thinking
[20:33] because if I made you to think that you
[20:35] don't have what you had thought you had
[20:37] then I've done my job I've exposed
[20:44] enough to the point that you realize you
[20:47] got to be saved see it's not just a
[20:55] thought of concept eternal life is a
[20:58] person he's a person he's not just a
[21:04] thought have you received the person of
[21:07] Jesus Christ
[21:10] Wow my brother brother Dale you tell me
[21:14] that that I have to receive a person is
[21:17] that
[21:17] mean I'm a person and there's a person
[21:19] inside of me and see once well was your
[21:25] mind work that away why would you not
[21:29] try to conceive something instead of
[21:32] arguing about it he's not a person comes
[21:37] and you get in a burden you're standing
[21:38] here and a person comes and steps down
[21:40] in you like another person no but I do
[21:47] believe in the person of Jesus Christ
[21:50] coming to live in your soul and make
[21:53] your soul eternal and that way then I
[21:58] can follow it all the way through and
[22:02] not have to worry about it why would you
[22:05] have to be born again why would it not
[22:08] beat the Nicodemus Nicodemus I I told
[22:11] you you're right now I know and you
[22:13] believe in right all you got to do is
[22:15] believe it and gave it whether the
[22:18] disciples two times are in Lucca bleeeh
[22:22] was where he opened to them their
[22:26] understanding of the Scriptures that's
[22:30] the approach that people say I know I'm
[22:35] born again cuz I've had my understanding
[22:38] opened
[22:39] well Paul said you could understand our
[22:42] own mysteries in how not charity you're
[22:51] nothing yet we think it's just an
[22:55] opening of our understanding it's a
[22:57] concept or a thought
[22:59] eternal life as a person he said I've
[23:04] never received a person Brazil so you
[23:08] don't know what the person of Jesus
[23:10] Christ really is it's the life of Christ
[23:17] to come and live in you
[23:23] that's what we want to try to deal with
[23:25] tonight because we want to go back to
[23:28] where we were Sunday when we were
[23:29] talking about
[23:30] we ended up or bring it into the message
[23:33] that the Bible says in Ephesians 1:4 and
[23:39] verse 5 that you were chosen in him that
[23:49] doesn't say you were chosen by him it
[23:55] says you were chosen in him well that's
[24:01] worth it when he when he done this and
[24:03] the plan come out and he looked down
[24:05] through time and he now you got him
[24:08] picking and choosing and you're not in
[24:11] the scripture cuz I read it well the
[24:16] scripture back up read it you were
[24:19] chosen in him when before the foundation
[24:24] of the world when was he chosen
[24:31] according to the Bible or the book of
[24:34] life was life with a lamb that was slain
[24:36] was written before the foundation of the
[24:39] world all the prophets said if your name
[24:41] wasn't written and dire and never will
[24:43] be written in there so we were chosen in
[24:52] him before the foundation world you
[24:59] realize what he's saying or the
[25:01] scriptures say and they look that we
[25:04] should be holding without blame before
[25:06] him and love having predestinated us
[25:09] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[25:11] Christ to himself according to the good
[25:13] pleasure of his wheel like Wade was
[25:16] saying Sunday what is the will of God is
[25:18] his word it's his word see didn't we
[25:26] were chosen in him it wasn't something
[25:29] we done so then Jacob and Esau is not
[25:34] being dealt with at 1 being a good part
[25:37] and the other one not your profit is one
[25:42] it said it he said Jacob alone was seed
[25:45] thereby he could be redeemed so I
[25:49] believe in the seed right but I don't
[25:55] believe could I believe what the Prophet
[25:57] said it's not the person that comes
[25:58] predestinated eternally from God but
[26:01] it's the seeder word I believe in the
[26:04] eternal seed but if you come in the
[26:10] world with an eternal seed you didn't
[26:12] need eternal life you don't realize see
[26:14] that's what gets me if people are still
[26:17] hold on that was the original to soul
[26:21] doctrine that you didn't need eternal
[26:28] life God give you a soul it was eternal
[26:32] Satan give you a soul you just kill the
[26:34] soul that Satan give you and you always
[26:38] was he trouble and yet people who say I
[26:44] always was eternal I believe it always
[26:46] was eater you said well that's the to
[26:48] soul doctrine no it's not brother well
[26:55] I'm still fighting after 40 years no no
[26:59] son and I'll fight til the day I die
[27:02] because eternal life to me more it means
[27:05] more than a thought or a concept or an
[27:08] idea anything it's the person in Jesus
[27:11] Christ that way Paul could say if not I
[27:17] that liveth but Christ that liveth in me
[27:21] he said in the life that I now live
[27:25] what's he ah now Lea watch the two
[27:28] persons right the life that I now live
[27:31] in the flesh he's defining himself as a
[27:36] person huh how did he say I live by the
[27:39] faith of the Son of God it looks like
[27:42] two person has done it one of them is
[27:46] over this way one of the other without
[27:48] oh yeah but not two people
[27:53] do you realize what I'm trying to do is
[27:55] preach it on the Godhead because your
[28:00] concept her idea will show what you
[28:03] believe and you come up with too many
[28:07] persons and too many things what did the
[28:12] Prophet say in the first seal he said I
[28:17] used to think that Jesus and God was the
[28:19] same person he said until I saw that he
[28:24] was I'm Jesus and and God wouldn't the
[28:27] same person he said until I saw that
[28:31] they are the same person then what did
[28:35] he say when he said the seal broke he
[28:38] said here stands a lion with the book in
[28:41] his hand and set out D'Argo's a white
[28:43] horse rider he said see you've got to be
[28:48] the Antichrist well because he had two
[28:51] persons anytime in the Bible you got two
[28:54] persons one of them got to be the devil
[28:56] there's no two persons to God that I'm
[29:00] still trying to preach the Guardian
[29:01] that's reading that's still title it the
[29:03] one God series if God is not complete
[29:12] without you the Prophet said then you
[29:17] must be part of God that was all I was
[29:21] trying to express son if you have
[29:26] eternal life the eternal life that you
[29:29] have is a part of God but we were chosen
[29:36] in him not to just say chosen now you'll
[29:42] find a quote from brother Branham so
[29:43] then you say well brother they'll don't
[29:45] believe this he you can find a quote for
[29:47] a brother and sister see that we was
[29:49] chosen by him that's alright but
[29:53] remember your final analysis droves back
[29:55] to the one thing what if you're chosen
[29:58] by him you got him choosing if you're
[30:02] chosen in him
[30:05] it's not him you were chosen in him you
[30:12] have to be a part of him to be chosen in
[30:16] him see then that makes it turn out to
[30:19] the right way right because Ephesian
[30:21] says what now listen go ahead and pull
[30:27] up number two which is John 15 we know
[30:32] that he done the choosing now we know he
[30:41] done the choosing we're not guessing her
[30:46] growth we're taking Scripture right how
[30:50] do we know we were chosen by he said we
[30:53] were you have not chosen me but I have
[31:00] chosen you and ordained you yes you
[31:05] should go and bring forth fruit and that
[31:07] your fruit should remain that whatsoever
[31:09] you should ask the Father in my name you
[31:13] give it to you to realize you and God
[31:18] are one you don't have to worry about
[31:19] the prior then would you understand what
[31:22] I said he said I chose you you didn't
[31:26] choose me let's see we're still hung up
[31:31] in when you say you never saw God God
[31:34] saw what I saw God brother Dale just
[31:37] don't understand I saw God I pray day
[31:40] and night and I fasted I done it and I
[31:43] saw God well the Bible says you didn't
[31:48] and the prophet said you did
[31:51] now what's this saying it's not saying
[31:53] you didn't pray in search after it that
[31:56] away
[31:56] he's saying you didn't know how to seek
[31:59] after God is that what it is you never
[32:04] understood how to seek God
[32:12] how do you seek God what you probably
[32:15] say about seeking garden didn't you make
[32:19] this statement he said pray and read
[32:22] your Bible he's not that the way you see
[32:25] God no we get down to pray this away or
[32:28] we get before Jesus and we pray this way
[32:31] they're like someone was saying the
[32:33] other day they got it you just walk up
[32:36] for brother browning speech or you stand
[32:38] there and they play it tight your word
[32:40] brother branham was praying for the
[32:43] situation then you go back to you see
[32:45] what I told you 40-something years ago
[32:53] he's gonna get worse than you ever
[32:54] thought
[32:55] it is very deceiving down but now listen
[33:00] so he said you have not chosen me but I
[33:08] chose you
[33:10] you know ordained you now is that true
[33:14] about daughter with it Jeremiah the
[33:16] Prophet where the scripture said that I
[33:18] knew you and ordained you before the
[33:20] foundation of the world to be a prophet
[33:26] see people don't want to take the
[33:28] scriptures it's just a thought let's get
[33:33] an idea a brother told me one time he
[33:35] said I know I'm gonna be there
[33:37] I said well praise God I sure hope I am
[33:41] you know and I believe I am he said
[33:45] coach the Prophet said pray for my
[33:47] children and he said I pray for him
[33:50] every day I said you know what I didn't
[33:54] want to discourage him who would that be
[33:59] the point of praying for his children
[34:01] that God would save you
[34:05] where's the blood of Jesus Christ
[34:12] all right now we were chosen of him when
[34:19] were we chosen were chosen of him
[34:27] when were we chosen the Thiessen said we
[34:32] were chosen before the foundation of the
[34:35] world so that has nothing to do what
[34:40] you're doing or don't do come on he saw
[34:51] was a better guy than Jacob but God said
[34:55] I he saw you know I love Jacob before
[35:00] the Bible said either one I've never
[35:02] done anything that the principle of
[35:05] election let's stand true what about it
[35:19] when was he chosen that's not the
[35:24] problems not me and you I've tried to
[35:26] say that from the beginning see we say
[35:30] well I accepted Jesus Christ and that's
[35:32] where people get that and see they don't
[35:34] father I accepted Jesus Christ as my
[35:36] savior it's up to him to save me that's
[35:39] a good statement but how will it hold
[35:43] true where the Prophet said it's not
[35:45] whether you accepted him he said it's
[35:48] whether he accepted you the maroc well I
[35:55] accepted him I'm gonna be there I've got
[35:58] eternal life but you remember in your
[36:05] typologies the point abraham accepted
[36:08] God but God gave Abraham the sign of
[36:15] circumcision to show that he had been
[36:18] accepted have you received the Holy
[36:22] Ghost to show you how been accepted
[36:29] everybody else tried to make us feel so
[36:31] good tell us how good we are in what we
[36:33] are what and you you keep telling us
[36:35] we're lost why would you get that idea I
[36:43] never told you is long I'm the guy
[36:48] that's always propping up things -
[36:50] keeping it from being to the point a
[36:51] saying you're lost
[36:53] I never said anybody was lost brother
[37:02] left here one diamond he said brother
[37:04] Dale said I've lost well you know what
[37:09] the order stayed and prayed through or
[37:14] went somewhere and prayed through but
[37:16] now he went somewhere else to find
[37:19] somebody that would tell him he's
[37:20] alright
[37:26] true alright so when was he chosen
[37:33] alright he was chosen before the
[37:37] foundation of the world before anything
[37:41] ever came into being the wrote the book
[37:48] of life was written the names the
[37:53] morning stars sang together sons of God
[37:54] shouted for joy all that back there when
[37:59] they saw the plan of redemption coming
[38:01] into view so why not try to find out how
[38:13] he was accepted now by what thought a
[38:20] reason do you have this you place that
[38:25] Jesus Christ was accepted never thought
[38:33] about that nobody thought about us being
[38:36] accepted it ain't whether we're accepted
[38:42] it's whether he was accepted
[38:52] hypothetical statement but what if Jesus
[38:55] would have refused to die on Calvary I
[39:01] guess that's the bigger words right
[39:03] hypothetical in other words it means you
[39:06] ain't gonna happen and can't be that way
[39:08] or whatever it is I'm not that educated
[39:11] it's just just trying to get a point
[39:13] across
[39:14] what if Jesus Christ would have refused
[39:17] to died on Calvary you know we know he
[39:27] did but I'm trying to make a point where
[39:33] would be our hoax
[39:34] if he was not accepted we wouldn't have
[39:41] any no the whole thing is whether or not
[39:46] he was accepted now how do you know for
[39:50] sure he was accepted now there's gonna
[39:59] be an odd statement so listen the reason
[40:03] I know he was accepted not how good he
[40:08] was and what he done what he thought all
[40:11] that's well and good I know you think
[40:14] like that I think on a different side
[40:15] I'm sorry the reason I know he was
[40:21] accepted is because he accepted me
[40:32] a little bit different right he accepted
[40:37] me how do you know exit because he gave
[40:42] me his own life and he knew that I would
[40:48] not be in the group that would say well
[40:50] I always was eternal I got the quotes he
[40:54] knew it would be different than that see
[41:00] the only way you could know anything is
[41:02] right in the Bible is by your own
[41:05] experience but I know it's right cause
[41:11] the prophet said it mm-hmm
[41:16] be careful remember I still do have an
[41:21] ability to quote a little bit what about
[41:27] when he was preaching to my horse rider
[41:29] is the whole ego
[41:38] hmm so you don't want to talk like that
[41:42] you'd eat you you you get confusing the
[41:45] point that you don't listen to what I'm
[41:46] trying to bring I'm trying to bring
[41:49] salvation to a point to you and I to
[41:53] realize what we've got now is the life
[41:59] of Christ living within us and if not
[42:02] then we need to be born again we need to
[42:14] be born again it's not the fact of
[42:15] whether or not we all two or whatever
[42:17] we've got to be so then if you're not
[42:24] satisfied with your new birth heaven
[42:28] help you don't stop seeking God you know
[42:32] what I always say when they get to that
[42:33] point I'd rather go all to my life
[42:36] seeking God and find out at the end of
[42:40] it that I had it all the time
[42:43] then to go all of my life thinking I had
[42:46] God and get on the end of it and find
[42:48] out I didn't have him see then it comes
[42:58] back to the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[43:06] what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[43:10] where do you believe the word or not in
[43:12] this
[43:18] shouting speaking in tongues crying I
[43:21] believe in all that so does your prophet
[43:24] so there's a Bible but what is the real
[43:28] evidence that the Prophet said God
[43:31] straightened him out in a vision now do
[43:35] you understand what it means when you
[43:37] say the God straightened me out do you
[43:43] realize what that means he was wrong
[43:52] come on when your profit stood there to
[43:57] show you how much God honors our prophet
[43:59] in his words you go back and check and
[44:02] see if I'm right when he was in that
[44:04] church age series in time when he was
[44:06] preaching that the white horse rider was
[44:09] the Holy Spirit get on the end of the
[44:11] message and listen to him he said if I
[44:14] have told you the truth let God come and
[44:18] vindicate it is it right and you know
[44:28] what God come down and vindicated right
[44:32] why because truth had never shined on
[44:36] the light of the word of that way so he
[44:39] wasn't responsible so he was okay and
[44:41] God honored the gift instead of the man
[44:49] are you with me so he chose us in him
[44:59] because we are his children
[45:08] now may I bring it this away
[45:12] we're not Trinitarians we use thoughts
[45:16] and concepts right because your prophet
[45:20] will say he said there he was said he's
[45:23] the father and said out of the father
[45:26] came to son and said out of the son came
[45:30] to lo gosh did he come out as a son as
[45:38] one having a beginning who created all
[45:48] things according to the Bible Jesus
[45:52] Christ did but according to Bible the
[45:55] father created according to the Bible
[45:57] God created you know evidently somewhere
[46:01] in the line it must mean that the father
[46:04] and God and the Holy Ghost is the Ceph
[46:08] same person
[46:09] and Jesus is his name and Jesus Christ
[46:14] created all things not the flesh no
[46:25] listen to what I'm getting here see we
[46:28] think that God in some way chooses us
[46:32] because of some good deed we done
[46:44] well I didn't do this I remember trying
[46:51] to preach a message one down and brother
[46:53] Colley got onto me after them and he was
[46:57] alright I don't know he knows that he
[46:59] knows what he said I told her one time I
[47:03] said I'm the chiefest of sinners I said
[47:06] with the Apostle Paul I stand as the
[47:09] chiefest of sinners
[47:12] brother Colley got up behind me and he
[47:14] said brother Dale is wrong in what he
[47:17] said they've called he never went out
[47:19] and drawn this and done that and done
[47:22] these other things that we all done I
[47:24] got up back up behind him and I said
[47:27] that's why I'm a chiefest of sinners
[47:29] because the closest one is the chiefest
[47:33] you realize clothes we liked how close
[47:36] Nicodemus was he realized how close
[47:39] Nicodemus was come on you don't think
[47:45] how close Nicodemus was not just cause
[47:51] he's a good guy he done all of the
[47:53] things in he he'd always live right
[47:55] there over there but he put his life on
[47:57] the line and went before the Lord Jesus
[48:00] Christ to talk to him which if I'd have
[48:04] found him the are they to blackballed
[48:05] him all the way through the right tone
[48:07] him out of the sin of the Sanhedrin sand
[48:10] everything in the world the man come up
[48:13] and asked a simple question he asked
[48:21] about salvation some way because Jesus
[48:24] said you must be born again what about
[48:32] it
[48:33] a man that close to the truth we get he
[48:39] turned and walked out I thank God for
[48:43] the things better Brennaman we've heard
[48:45] him say things he said that I've heard
[48:47] him say wringing my heart after thanking
[48:50] God for he said Nicodemus and Gamaliel
[48:53] would be given eternal life he said
[48:57] there's no record there
[48:58] received it he said but they'll be given
[49:01] eternal life
[49:02] I said glory when Nicodemus to walk up
[49:07] on one day and yes hey if you hadn't
[49:11] come I wouldn't be here that's a
[49:15] wonderful thought it's not just but to
[49:17] think about how close a man was to the
[49:19] Kreutz but yet he couldn't follow the
[49:20] truth how close are we when we studied
[49:26] the message we had in the message we
[49:28] formed by the message we we live by the
[49:31] message the cop couldn't home being vine
[49:44] what do you put your salvation huh okay
[49:47] you know back up come on
[49:51] you back down to hurt the war all right
[49:55] when was he chosen their lifestyle he
[49:59] was chosen before before before before
[50:06] the foundation of the world he was
[50:10] chosen when what did the prophets say in
[50:12] the beginning What did he say
[50:15] before the eternal you realize you
[50:24] cannot explain that no how can you
[50:29] explain in the beginning but before the
[50:30] eternal the back dark he was chosen and
[50:36] you know what then when the hopes we got
[50:39] is the fact that we were a part of him
[50:44] you said watch out him did to father
[50:47] choose the son
[50:58] listen Church when Almighty God Father
[51:05] whatever you want to call him when he
[51:10] had those thoughts within him and those
[51:15] thoughts were eternal he thought of you
[51:25] not thought of you as an object to
[51:27] something he thought of you as one of
[51:30] his children that's what I was trying to
[51:32] say Sunday he thought he was being one
[51:37] of his children
[51:40] then who was accepted not because he
[51:48] moved over into a son that had to take
[51:50] place for it to work out right but I
[51:56] thought the Bible said the probably end
[51:59] wave was bringing it out and brought out
[52:01] to get him anytime they brother Ron said
[52:03] Jesus never died to give us an
[52:04] inheritance he said he died to redeem us
[52:08] back to that inheritance the Bible says
[52:11] our inheritance is eternal life so God
[52:18] had to become flesh and die we'd be able
[52:23] to pass out that eternal life there was
[52:26] no way his children could come into
[52:28] being without his death so then what was
[52:37] the choosing
[52:45] he was choosing his own word or seed his
[52:50] own children they were a part of him
[52:55] that was what was back there was part of
[53:01] him the only way we can talk about being
[53:05] back their only way we can talk about
[53:06] eternal life is to be a part of him and
[53:13] then let him impart his own eternal life
[53:16] out into his children because according
[53:20] to acts 17 let's get this one I don't
[53:23] get nothing I'll get this scripture
[53:25] anyway look at the next one
[53:27] I want you to look at Scripture and see
[53:31] see the way God says things maybe one of
[53:36] these days it'll don't own you to take
[53:40] the word and listen to try to see what
[53:44] it's talking about look what he says
[53:48] this is Paul Mars he'll write acts 19 I
[53:55] mean 17 Paul on Mars Hill and what did
[54:01] they have now what's the end of the
[54:04] story what did they have on Mars he'll I
[54:06] was trying to hit this the other day I
[54:07] know I need to come into that that's so
[54:10] wonderful
[54:12] they had all kind of little cubicles
[54:16] right there spots or places and they had
[54:20] a little guard sitting there right am i
[54:26] right now wouldn't just open spaces they
[54:29] had something that represented their God
[54:30] right a statue a dog a cat or a horse or
[54:34] a mule or you know and Paul when he gets
[54:42] down to that he says now this unknown
[54:44] see they left one little place just in
[54:46] case they missed him that one little
[54:48] place and they said to the unknown God
[54:51] and Paul picks that up and he says I'd
[54:54] like to explain to you this unknown God
[54:57] and he explained Jesus Christ see they
[55:02] were Mars Hill they they wanted to hear
[55:05] stories they loved to hear things
[55:07] according to histories and that that was
[55:10] really their meeting place to learn
[55:12] about their gods and some new thing or
[55:14] some something they always wanted a new
[55:17] thing about the people in the message
[55:21] okay we look what he winds up saying to
[55:28] conclude this one he's talking about
[55:30] watch what he said for in him we live
[55:33] and move and how our being who's he
[55:39] talking about this unknown God that
[55:40] they're looking at he's explained to him
[55:42] that is Jesus Christ and what a certain
[55:48] of your own poets have said in other
[55:50] words your own people
[55:51] oh smart he used it against them he knew
[55:54] what they had talked and says your poets
[55:57] saying that we are also his offspring
[56:03] he's smart he used it against him see
[56:05] how could he argue with him when he was
[56:07] quoting them the words you say we are
[56:11] his offspring listen for as much then as
[56:22] we are the offspring of God
[56:32] we ought not to think that the Godhead
[56:35] is locking the gold or silver or stone
[56:38] graven by art and man's devices now what
[56:43] does he mean why did he say that
[57:00] simply because of one thing they had
[57:04] their little places and they had the
[57:06] little images believed in they were God
[57:09] this group believed this was God this
[57:12] group this was gardius group that was
[57:13] going all of them had it and then it was
[57:15] one little space just in case they
[57:17] messed up and didn't get them all they
[57:18] left one just in case what a marvelous
[57:26] statement
[57:28] I've studied that forty some years till
[57:35] this week what does he mean or as much
[57:46] then as we are the offspring of God
[57:49] we're not to think that the Godhead is
[57:54] like undergo or silver or stone graven
[57:58] by art and man's devices they had their
[58:07] arts and devices sitting there to
[58:10] represent their gods right are you in me
[58:13] they had their images they had their
[58:16] things they had a toad stew you know
[58:18] they had a toad frog they had a dog they
[58:21] had of this they had an image they had
[58:23] something ever God they could think of
[58:25] and just in case they missed it they
[58:28] just left open hole Paul has just
[58:36] explained the greatest message to them
[58:42] and effort to marvel that could ever be
[58:46] thought of that Jesus was Almighty God
[58:57] right he just explained that Jesus was
[59:00] Almighty God he says then in other words
[59:05] in plain language
[59:06] he said then what do you want me to do
[59:08] you want me to go out here and take some
[59:10] mud and form it together and build me a
[59:12] little bitty something and set it in
[59:13] that hole he said because the Godhead is
[59:18] not that the Godhead is not silver and
[59:21] gold the Godhead is the offspring of
[59:27] Almighty God he said oh but you can't
[59:33] look too far I wasn't the Prophet that
[59:35] made the statement that he said God is
[59:37] not complete without you I didn't make
[59:40] that statement he did are you listening
[59:48] Paul turns back to him and he says look
[59:53] you say you're the offspring of God and
[59:58] they say yes with what we believe well
[1:00:01] it is your garter toads - why don't you
[1:00:06] look like him is your God God a horse is
[1:00:12] your God there so your guard down why
[1:00:14] don't you look like him he said the
[1:00:21] Godhead is not to be gold and silver the
[1:00:26] Godhead is to be a living people no no
[1:00:33] the Godhead was in him how many times he
[1:00:35] want me to quote brother branham now Oh
[1:00:38] God was what'd he do pour it into Christ
[1:00:46] all Christ poured into the church to
[1:00:51] take her back to the garden
[1:00:52] so whatever God is Christ is so now you
[1:00:58] see the God is not completely that's you
[1:01:01] God's not complete without you why
[1:01:04] because you're as how spring but I'd say
[1:01:08] now brother mark
[1:01:10] make me an image to represent your God
[1:01:16] he's waiting well I'll have to go down
[1:01:18] to know what I'd make him I'll try to
[1:01:21] make me I don't know
[1:01:25] you asked me gonna be careful what I'm
[1:01:31] saying you listened you asked me to show
[1:01:36] you what my God looks like
[1:01:47] that's what's your prophet said he said
[1:01:54] Jesus Christ at about thirty was the
[1:01:58] closest of anything he'd ever seen
[1:02:00] they were stalled by Hofmann all right
[1:02:03] so you know what Jesus must look pretty
[1:02:06] close
[1:02:06] like Hoffman he's not silver and gold do
[1:02:16] you want me to build you a statue of
[1:02:18] what I think God looks like he wouldn't
[1:02:21] listen a few weeks ago when I cried and
[1:02:23] tried to get you the Prophet said
[1:02:27] Hoffman caught that the closest anything
[1:02:33] he'd ever seen
[1:02:34] and you remember he saw him more than
[1:02:37] one time the card head is not silver and
[1:02:46] gold if it was you'd build your guard to
[1:02:50] look like what you want him to be but
[1:02:55] your Godhead has looked like a human
[1:02:58] being and what then is the rest of the
[1:03:01] Godhead I said be careful in catch what
[1:03:05] I'm saying I'm looking at the rest are
[1:03:08] the part of the Godhead that we're
[1:03:10] connected to you said you're going a
[1:03:14] little bit too far that ain't far enough
[1:03:16] we ain't stepped over yet do you think
[1:03:20] that's too far then you just hold on
[1:03:23] until we get to finishing with this
[1:03:25] message you might find out a little few
[1:03:27] things because you see I believe that
[1:03:30] what the Prophet said he said God wanted
[1:03:33] a man in his own image
[1:03:37] and they made the man in Genesis 1:26
[1:03:41] and 27 in his own image he made at the
[1:03:46] off me man but it was a man that even
[1:03:50] Moses saw him Abraham saw him and what
[1:03:55] did they see
[1:03:59] what do you think Abraham saw old man
[1:04:03] dragon I thought your prophet said that
[1:04:12] they saw Jesus in theophany that's what
[1:04:21] I thought see the Godhead is not locking
[1:04:26] the gold and silver the Godhead is
[1:04:30] locking under Jesus Christ and the
[1:04:35] people are he is offspring
[1:04:39] what is his offspring to look like
[1:04:48] I thought I'd preach this out and went
[1:04:51] have nothing for Sunday but I still got
[1:04:53] a lot rolled up here you that got him
[1:04:55] just keeping with we get back to it
[1:04:57] Sunday but do you understand what I'm
[1:05:01] getting at what does your Godhead look
[1:05:04] like what does your God look like well
[1:05:10] nobody's saying God at any time
[1:05:13] well would you mind keep on quote read
[1:05:16] that Scripture I mean you you're quoting
[1:05:19] part of it you got it right
[1:05:20] no man seen got it but the Sun came to
[1:05:24] declare maybe two scriptures putting
[1:05:28] together but is it right the only
[1:05:30] begotten of the Father hath declared him
[1:05:33] or brought him out into the open that he
[1:05:36] could be saying he said to Philip Philip
[1:05:39] if you've seen me he said you have seen
[1:05:42] the father
[1:05:43] and according to my Bible it says the
[1:05:47] fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt in
[1:05:49] him so kurtter know here a few pages and
[1:05:55] read something where your prophet said
[1:05:57] when he went to hell he said you went
[1:06:01] with him he said when he walked the
[1:06:07] streets
[1:06:08] he said you walked the streets with him
[1:06:12] since when he was crucified said you
[1:06:15] just crucified with him I said when he
[1:06:18] rose you rose with him cause we're his
[1:06:26] offspring where was the children act
[1:06:33] where were we act when Jesus was here
[1:06:41] he wouldn't in Jesus we never will be so
[1:06:45] we were in Jesus Christ not his little
[1:06:48] identities our people are persons right
[1:06:53] gonna run said we were there in gene
[1:06:56] phone where was he had I mean where was
[1:07:06] we at when he was here remember my whole
[1:07:10] thought is one thing to get to see if he
[1:07:13] if he's accepted then I know I'm
[1:07:20] accepted why because the eternal life
[1:07:24] that I have now in me was a part of him
[1:07:28] that's the only way I can know for sure
[1:07:31] D that I've been accepted well you just
[1:07:40] make us think that we think we get it
[1:07:44] all figured out and you come along and
[1:07:46] and you bring out these great things and
[1:07:49] we think it's just you trying to with
[1:07:51] your brain to show how smart you are
[1:07:53] I ain't worried about it I've said this
[1:08:01] before and I don't worry about it if my
[1:08:06] intellect can out preach your Holy Ghost
[1:08:13] then I would be concerned whether I had
[1:08:17] the Holy Ghost or not if what I've
[1:08:25] taught is the truth and lines up with
[1:08:29] the prophets message oh now I ain't
[1:08:32] talking about a little bit we differ
[1:08:33] here we differ over here
[1:08:35] you were terminologies working human
[1:08:36] beings well you think he's this I think
[1:08:39] he's that way little bit little time but
[1:08:41] not off the word you see where Paul was
[1:08:47] anchoring that thing down he was
[1:08:50] preaching Jesus Christ as a human being
[1:08:53] right
[1:08:54] and he says you think you're God he's
[1:08:56] like unto them stones out there in him
[1:08:58] them images you made said it's not so
[1:09:01] you yourself are denied it by saying we
[1:09:05] are his offspring we know we're not be
[1:09:11] beautiful and we let's make us tourism
[1:09:13] and get ready to quit I mean say that
[1:09:17] was 20 people sitting out there 20 idols
[1:09:19] you realize what Paul was saying to him
[1:09:22] did you say we're his offspring was your
[1:09:28] garden look like it would look like this
[1:09:29] buyer then we all need to look like a
[1:09:32] bar dog we need to look like the dog but
[1:09:39] he said that Godhead is not like that
[1:09:41] you've done prove that yourself because
[1:09:43] you didn't make a statement they say
[1:09:46] they're their offspring and they say
[1:09:49] their offspring and they say their
[1:09:51] offspring and they say their offspring
[1:09:53] he said you say there's a whole group
[1:10:00] that he is your you're his offspring so
[1:10:05] every one of you are wrong
[1:10:08] he said because I've preached Jesus
[1:10:12] Christ to you and he's Almighty God and
[1:10:16] said we are truly his offspring because
[1:10:20] we're his children I'm not trying to be
[1:10:24] able to name each to look like something
[1:10:25] I thought that we were to take this
[1:10:30] image to walk into the stature of a
[1:10:32] perfect land to let it be his image do
[1:10:39] you understand
[1:10:44] according relations 3 we are the
[1:10:49] children of God by faith in Christ Jesus
[1:11:02] according to Romans 8 we are the
[1:11:07] children of God and we are heirs of God
[1:11:11] and joint heirs with Jesus Christ so you
[1:11:18] realize now that I'm trying my best to
[1:11:20] explain to you brother Dale don't know
[1:11:22] God is an image my God is a person he's
[1:11:30] the person of Jesus Christ I hope you
[1:11:34] follow that and keep it for another
[1:11:35] couple of messages oh it's burning in
[1:11:37] the heart to see them stand out there
[1:11:39] see who see Jesus Christ stand out there
[1:11:43] and say let time be in a world comes
[1:11:51] into be who from from Jesus Christ who
[1:11:58] are you gonna put my car to speak it in
[1:11:59] existence I'm at it who are you gonna
[1:12:07] say spoke it into existence
[1:12:08] I was just a spirit brother day me go
[1:12:16] ahead but remember one thing Psalms 139
[1:12:26] in continuance was my members fashion as
[1:12:30] Wade was bringing up when he's yet not
[1:12:33] perfect you know not complete not
[1:12:36] brought out but he said in the book they
[1:12:41] were written a book the book of the lamb
[1:12:47] slain before the foundation the world
[1:12:51] must have had a whole lot
[1:12:54] what part of you was back dire what part
[1:13:05] of you was back there let me read that
[1:13:07] one
[1:13:07] we played over number eight brother
[1:13:09] Anderson let's read number eight it's
[1:13:15] gonna be the problem till we get
[1:13:16] everything set up when I get over here
[1:13:17] and then back dark and you know he's
[1:13:20] cold we're gonna be running backwards
[1:13:21] before right in the middle of the golf
[1:13:23] thing and I'm will be that'll be alright
[1:13:34] questions and answers on Genesis the
[1:13:40] first man now he made the first man in
[1:13:44] His image now you know the quote that
[1:13:47] goes back up above there where he said
[1:13:49] God's first creation was himself and out
[1:13:53] of him he created the Sun and out of the
[1:13:55] Sun created the logo son out of the
[1:13:57] hogar square you know the story you know
[1:13:59] the state once you've been reading it he
[1:14:03] made the first man in His image and
[1:14:04] we're returning back to that image
[1:14:06] that's right to our first created image
[1:14:11] when God created me William Branham I
[1:14:18] was before the foundation of the world
[1:14:22] he made my being my spirit I wasn't
[1:14:30] conscious for anything as far as I know
[1:14:32] of but I was there
[1:14:34] oh I don't believe you're getting it but
[1:14:42] now just a minute Jesus told the
[1:14:46] disciples that he knew them before the
[1:14:48] foundation of the world and Paul said
[1:14:50] here that he chose us in him before the
[1:14:53] world began now there was some part of
[1:14:57] our man Neville and the rest of you all
[1:15:03] here
[1:15:06] see we love did they get back up here
[1:15:08] now I'm not I'm not against all of your
[1:15:10] doctrines and ideas that people are
[1:15:11] that's your business you see you put
[1:15:14] everything in brother branham and you
[1:15:15] run it back up in there you got a
[1:15:17] problem
[1:15:17] I don't preach that away I preach the
[1:15:20] Word of God that's up to you to believe
[1:15:23] the rest in it I'm gonna argue with you
[1:15:25] cause our green ain't gonna sell nothing
[1:15:27] but look he said there would see we can
[1:15:32] say like I said we said brother Branham
[1:15:34] was back there
[1:15:35] I just believe he was back there in the
[1:15:40] same quote what does he say now there
[1:15:44] was some part of our man Neville and the
[1:15:47] rest of you all here that's in Christ
[1:15:51] Jesus before the world ever begun some
[1:15:58] part of you what was that what was that
[1:16:10] it was a part of God and was before the
[1:16:18] foundation of the world and will hold
[1:16:21] true to bring all the way out to where
[1:16:24] we're at
[1:16:25] I'll leave that we get to Sunday morning
[1:16:28] let you think I'm a firm believer in
[1:16:33] eternal life I'm a firm believer in
[1:16:37] Jesus Christ is Almighty God I'm a firm
[1:16:43] believer in that Christ had to die to
[1:16:50] release the lot see he didn't die didn't
[1:16:53] listen inheritance inheritance would
[1:16:55] weave the father he died to release the
[1:16:58] life and now I know can I quote a little
[1:17:01] bit we say but God can't die you ever
[1:17:05] heard him in the message don't you on
[1:17:07] your seventh on your River Jordan people
[1:17:09] you never to make history my god take
[1:17:12] die I'll have you know my god came down
[1:17:17] Road random City do you
[1:17:23] but he said God can't die in spirit we
[1:17:31] said he died in the flesh - what was the
[1:17:36] death of the flesh
[1:17:38] releasing the life that could come out
[1:17:42] to go into you and I the only way it
[1:17:45] could be done was for him to die to
[1:17:48] release the life with God in spirit came
[1:17:51] - hi I'll show you where brother Owen
[1:17:53] said he said God in the Holy Spirit came
[1:17:55] down what about it what part of you was
[1:18:05] back there my brother do you really got
[1:18:10] us now huh
[1:18:11] we've always believed that you said
[1:18:12] there wasn't nothing back there I still
[1:18:14] say there wasn't nothing back there
[1:18:16] Luke okay we were just a part of God
[1:18:19] that was back time if I have eternal
[1:18:23] life and not eternal life that I have
[1:18:24] was back time if you have eternal out to
[1:18:27] eternal life you have was back there
[1:18:28] before the world our words get it may I
[1:18:32] quote brother Branham he says there is
[1:18:35] no honest maybe he didn't use the words
[1:18:37] he says there's no to eternal life
[1:18:40] don't make sure to get the right
[1:18:42] statement he said there's no to eternal
[1:18:44] life
[1:18:46] they can't be to eternal lives there's
[1:18:50] only one eternal life right come on
[1:18:56] musicians think on these things is your
[1:19:02] Godhead silver and gold well I never
[1:19:06] thought about you know that if your
[1:19:09] Godhead is anything other than Jesus
[1:19:11] Christ you're making it some kind of a
[1:19:13] of an image
[1:19:21] you're making it some kind of an image
[1:19:23] or something I told you my image that's
[1:19:28] why I love it and that prophet said it
[1:19:31] and I caught what he was saying back
[1:19:33] there a long time ago when he said
[1:19:36] Hoffman at 33 is the closest thing of
[1:19:41] Jesus Christ that I've ever seen
[1:19:45] he's got ones what was it bro more what
[1:19:48] did he said in there he said now I don't
[1:19:50] like his picture and you most of it if
[1:19:53] you look around you'll find most of the
[1:19:56] time that they are related in showing
[1:19:58] sometimes I believe his name is wrong
[1:20:00] brown or something and he said I don't
[1:20:02] believe in here but he said the image
[1:20:06] that was betrayed there was the closest
[1:20:10] that Jesus Christ so what would Jesus
[1:20:14] Christ look like in eternity like Jesus
[1:20:19] Christ but you know what do you look
[1:20:26] like the one that appeared to Moses you
[1:20:29] know what do you look like the one that
[1:20:31] appeared a Brian as he appeared to you
[1:20:43] we see somebody come along say but
[1:20:45] brother to help brother branham say
[1:20:47] brother branham hi so Jesus you know
[1:20:52] what he believed what he believed
[1:20:56] wouldn't you if you believe what you
[1:20:59] believe about Jesus looking like
[1:21:01] Hoffman's head of Christ and somebody
[1:21:04] said I want to tell you what my Jesus
[1:21:05] looks like then he described some
[1:21:08] hardness looking outfit
[1:21:10] what would you say well I got a right

[1:21:26] brother said then he believed what God
[1:21:28] was so and so I said I don't care what
[1:21:31] do you believe God is that ain't what
[1:21:33] the Prophet said are you strong enough
[1:21:41] to put all your faith into that so

[1:21:46] this thing's all about those time's
