anything like that we're just part of the body of Christ so we just say welcome to everybody but we have a little feller to be dedicated this morning like his name is what William is that right okay well if a family would come on we'll take care of the dedication and get everything done for the little one cuz it's good to to get them to the Lord early now we don't we don't have any infant baptisms if that's what you believe that's fine but we don't do that we do what the Bible says - worth it you know they brought the little ones to Jesus and then he prayed over them dedicated them to the Lord and then he would give them back to the parents all right now that's what we do here and everybody if they will derstand because what we do here we dedicate to baby get it back to the parents to raise the child we'll see wherever one standing for the dedication because we're all to live before this child to where the child can see Jesus Christ that's the goal of everybody should be to live before the child and that way mama daddy brothers sisters they can all have a part to do with you know in raising the child because that's just what we do and we take it that way so if you would bring the little feller yeah we should already don't want to drop him no of course I've held a few of them before in my life and you know we just bring a little William everybody can see him get him the word that they can take some pictures of him okay you get rid of that pacifier what I'm not gonna bother you now if you want to fight okay well fine hey I wish you could see what's going on up here he laughing like everything at me I live too when I look in the mirror sons were don't worry about it okay father we thank you for an opportunity to be able to hold a little one like this Lord we know that in eternity you look down and you see us you see what we do and everything and we Lord we just do the best we can do as human beings and there's a family they bring the little one to where it can be dedicated to you Lord we ask you to just take care of the little a little William and that ever be raised up for you and your honor and your glory we give him back to the family that they may raise him for you Lord we're all standing with him to believe that our lives needs to be an example the little ones can follow thereafter we thank you for this opportunity in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen so if you want to get some pictures right there okay get him to the Lord early and praying you know children used to be brother here's the doctor he would maybe agree with this part back was babies used to be born when they were just almost immune to sicknesses for like a six months period you know because of the the way they were mowing and everything that's all breaking down to her you know in the human race and the genes and the makeup is breaking down but still we believe in dedicating them to the Lord and asking God to take care of them because that's that's the point then we live before them that they may see a life and follow that in okay amen we appreciate them bringing it's appreciate the honor of dedicating a little one to the Lord I mean if you like turning your scriptures turn to Matthew 16 and Hebrews 1 we'll go right into the service never wait we'll be back I think Tuesday there are way ahead over there in the Philippines now there then in the afternoon so they're having services and things and then they're supposed to have I think one more in anyhow and be flying back in I believe it's Tuesday she'll be much in prayer that the Lord would would take care of and give him a safe journey and all like that Luke I mean Matthew 16 and in Hebrews one father we thank you for an opportunity to be able to gather together this morning to come and to serve you and to worship you and to honor your great name we're all gather for that purpose and for your love and your grace unto us we ask you now to just be with us as we read your words you come up and speak to our hearts that you may direct us all into you and father as we do we know that there's things that we have need of in life and a lot of that is healing sometimes and we have many among us that are sick we ask you to just reach down and touch the ones that are sick deliver them let your love in your grace be with each one we thank you for all things and we ask you to just forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in Jesus name Amen Matthew 16 we'll go to verse 13 when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi yes this disciples saying whom do men say that I the Son of Man and they said some say thorat John the Baptist some alas other jury mice or one of the prophets and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee in other words even my own life's not made this known now who makes it no but my father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth she'll be bound up spell bound on earth she'll be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven let's go to Hebrews just for the one scripture in Hebrews it would take three verses God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the father's by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son then we at the pointed heir of all things with whom also he made the world who being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he hath about had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high amen you may be seated Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we know that you know that we study the Bible and we know that throughout the Old Testament because that's what we'll just speak about for a minute you saw God manifesting himself and that's why we read Hebrews they're worth it in times past and he spake you know to mankind by our it would be translated in the prophets because they were speaking God's Word that was the way to deliver the way God delivered our brought down the Bible as we call it to her that we could read it was by the prophets that spoke those things and you know in doing that all right and they would be called it's in you know son of man you find that terminology used a lot in the Old Testament son of man prophesy to Jeremiah and all of the prophets because that was for the time God using someone to speak his word and bringing forth the you know the Word of God is what God's Way of making himself known all right because that's what we're talking about the making God known because that's what we're here for we're here to understand we're here to follow and be guided in the word see throughout that Old Testament you know a lot of people can't seem to find God in doing it but back there you had a lot of times that he would speak through the even David would speak so until it would sound like he'd be speaking in the very first person David would say they pierced my hands and my feet you know and stuff like that and that's how close they were to it because God was using those Old Testament Saints to bring forth his being our person or understanding to bring God to a reality because that's the whole purpose what's the purpose of the Bible what's the purpose of Christianity what should be our thoughts on Christianity or anything what is it to be we're supposed to be here to let the world see us because they follow us and you know they see us every day but that's way then as we were saying about dedicating the baby see we dedicate the baby we saw that was just dedicated now see every day we live before that child is a great opportunity for that child to be molded you know made into ways that they he can see something and want to be like that that he sees well that's the purpose of God in the beginning he wanted to reveal himself to mankind he existed alone back there so he wanted to do something so he created man all right in in creating man and bringing him for as he was doing that then he was making himself known or revealing himself you know in those terminologies all right in that stage for you know a few thousand years as he was revealing himself in those forms that best he could do back there all right but one day see he walked upon earth himself and Isaiah 9:6 says unto us a child is born unto us a son is given all right in his name shall be father it's a great number of titles to come forth all right and that would be the Lord Jesus Christ as he walked upon earth all right no as he walked there then the Bible said that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself but what was the purpose of Jesus Christ coming was to reveal the father not to reveal himself he didn't come to make yourself known he come to make the father known what is our purpose of of Christianity to make our Father known see to the world that's why we were supposed to live that before the world that they can see Christ in our our being and then want to be like that alright but see then you see him died as he walked upon the earth and he declared on many occasions that he was the son of man who the men say i the son of man am well they didn't understand it cousins i've always say about Peter when he said that to Peter you know he said who men say that I the Son of Man am Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God now he didn't ask him that question he asked him the question of who was the son of man alright but yet see for the time we read are that were that jesus said upon this rock not on Peter and see not even on Jesus but on the revelation of Jesus Christ he said upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it they've been against it down through time but they've never been able to close the church out completely because they don't matter how bad it got in the Dark Ages you still had that as it was to come forth and promised the word they'd be a restoration all right see then you see him as he lived upon earth as the son of man and he kept the clearin he didn't say I'm the son of God he said under Son of Man because he was a human vessel that's the one thing that we need to remember I I used to even when I was a kid I thought well you know if he was God in flesh then he couldn't stump his toe and hurt himself well that was my carnality but as I begin to reel later on then he was God in human flashes the Bible would be speaking of it that's easy to follow and the Bible even says that the eternal God head you know father son Holy Ghost can be understood by the things that we see that we have no excuse the you're a perfect example of what God was in the basis of what it is see you know you're a person you've been a father a mother whatever you have many manifestations we all do but yet we're one person I'm a father I'm a son I'm a human but that's the many manifestation but I'm the same person it don't change persons it just changes the way you manifest yourself all right he manifested himself there in the Old Testament and using those prophets and as he did he brought forth the word for that time within when he walked upon this earth in the human flesh that we call Jesus that body was a creation to where that the purpose of death could be fulfilled because that was the reason he came he came to die knowing that you and I could not follow him or understand him you know we couldn't comprehend God in the basis see God would have to come to mankind and make yourself known some way to work that you know we could understand it so he came and made himself known in flash and he lived his life and in all it but he he came for the purpose of dying that he could be as the Bible would talk about that he's my brother well I see he became a human being in flesh all right that body was a creation yes by the word we believe that all right we believe in the virgin birth we don't believe in Mary having anything to do with that other than the fact that she was a human income by incubator there's the same thing you know and as she did all she done was received to the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee and that which is born in these they are a part a person was used to bring that body into being to where it would be kinfolks to us to where he could understand us and as he walked in life you notice he went through so then he was a child to a child he went through the parts of life of 10 years old 12 years old he he was a little boy you know and he walked and he done you know as such little boys and things done we went out and climbed the trees and hollered and sounds like Tarzan and jumped out and screamed and played and had a good time you know as children we'll see he done that because he was a he was coming forth to be what would be needed for the time but then it came forth and life that he came to where his purpose was so he started ministering he started preaching about thirty years of age he began his ministry and you know and as he did he he began to speak about things and he talked about son of man well they couldn't understand because they couldn't follow his they knew a son of man they knew the terminologies but they couldn't understand how this man could speak about being the son of man but that's who he was he was God made manifest in human flesh all right because that's where it goes John 1 in the beginning was the word Word was with God in the Word was God verse 14 says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld it as his only begotten all right see then as it comes forth on in life he come to the purpose of having to know that he without to die so he would constantly speak of things of going away and and dying giving his life and things would happen and as he did then he it came into being what his real purpose was far to release that life God was dwelling in that human vessel alright Almighty God or else we're the most deceived people that are in the world think because he he was either God or not God see if you say wouldn't God what are we doing here let's go eat drink be merry because tomorrow we die but if he was God we better depend upon the fact of believing who he was he said I and my father are one well where they want or were they two or three or what were they by looking at it as seeing what you see and and comprehending from the scriptures that there are that human vessel was made for the purpose of receiving so when that baby was born God stepped in to that human vessel alright Almighty God Himself just stepped into that vessel as it came forward just as when the little William came forth right there was a life from God that when he came into the world then he went from living as a fish floating in water in alive but just in a second he was out and you couldn't put him back in water no more I've been there seen too many of them when they wash your face and things you know and and when they do you see them they'll that's rubbing faces and stick them under the spigot without for a little bit that kind of in between two worlds but then they start getting choking and you don't put them back on learning more that way because it changes things all right but that little fella see was God himself in human flesh that's why the scripture speak of under us a child is born unto us a son is given then as he raised up he came to his purpose as I said to where he could give his life that could make the way for you and I to be saved alright see the work today everything is in terminologies as we called it the educational world and I'm not against that I believe in but I don't believe in trying to make the educational world above the word I believe the word first and then the education is fine all right but seeing the line of Education and said then we we try to understand everything by our own terminologies well those things don't work we have to depend upon God if we're going to talk about spiritual matters all right so then he came to give his life alright on that day when he died on Calvary what was death what's death to you and I you said well did he die did one now the one that was within him did not it just exited the body just like you do you said well sorts Oh God well what happened well he's died now tell me what happened see what was motivating our making you live as a human being which is the soul in the spirit of mankind and in that it that just exits out of the body and leaves the body all right that's what happened to the Lord Jesus God just extracted himself forever how you say step back came out of flesh if you don't call it acted the part of death to mankind because he didn't die in spirit he didn't die in soul the body was what died cause take the life out the body dies I mean that's certain to all of us doesn't matter who all right but then see one day you know some few days later he comes back he's resurrected he goes up nittany and then he comes back onto their Pentecost to live in the people okay you had one little Jesus walking on the earth you had one little Messiah as we call it but they're only at that Pentecost he had 122 first quack you know first time it happened is 120 see if Satan had went on vacation that's where he goofs up he can't never follow it correctly he tries to break up the plan and mess up everything so he thought killing him would do it killing the body was what released the life that could come back into you and Aiko that was the only way we could ever have anything is for him to come and live in us so Paul said now it's why Christ in you the hope of glory all right see on the day of Pentecost then he came into the church and there still fulfill the 121st one three thousand rottnest in a few minutes down Stars and like I said it's Satan and one on vacation he'd been better off but he's too dumb you know I'm sorry but I feel sorry for him is the smartest thing there is outside of God yet he ain't got enough sense to realize what's going on God this used him as a plan to get it to where he could exit out of that flesh and and when he stepped out of the flesh then he couldn't understand what happened but on the day of Pentecost he had a hundred and twentieth the first why what little Jesus is little Messiah stepped up little children of God downstairs it goes and they're all having a big time and 3,000 are saved they one message all right starting the church and bringing it down through time Dhar then would be fulfilled as that Holy Ghost would be coming into the people the new birth is we could call it as it begin to come into the people now it's fulfilled the Scriptures the of all that Old Testament all of those things that was transpiring was being fulfilled right there and coming in the church and that's where he said to Peter now watch he said to Peter as we read the scripture he said who demands say I the Son of Man am well Peter couldn't understand that he said dark the Christ the Son of the Living God all right the Christ means The Anointed are the anointed the Messiah all right so then here comes the Messiah on the day of Pentecost right back into the hearts of the Saints in what we would call the new birth and as it would come forth see then that would be the son of God as he was speaking up and he said upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail so down through the church age is now a time from Calvary up to where we are it's been not son of man think because that would be the the end time we'll get that in a second but it would be the son of God God in you Christ in you the hope of glory when he would release that life that it would come back in to the people on the day of Pentecost making them the family of God are the children of God all right since showing that he would come down through time as son of of God okay then we get down to the end time and as we get down to the end time we we come into this last part of the of life in the journey and we we find that God starts bringing forth again the thoughts of son of man because that would be his point that he would be coming back in human flesh in our flesh he he started that journey on the day of Pentecost when the Upper Room when the Holy Ghost fell upon the people but he's completing his journey here so it's not to remain just son of God is to get to understand where Jesus said who demand say I the son of man they need would go through life and he'd speak of these things and he'd say now I've got to go away and he said if I go away then I'll come back read Matthew Mark Luke and John I'll come back and I'll live in you all right and si Jin in the end time he would return to fulfill the scriptures of Malachi for one of the things that would cover how that he would come back as son of man just for a little while because that would be part of the journey of mankind that the theologians and thing missed that understanding because they couldn't follow him when he was saying something man son of man son of man they couldn't follow that because they had no comprehension it would take the Holy Ghost itself to reveal those things the world would be seen but it could be son of man back tire son of man in human flesh then it would be son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost coming through the church ages I'm trying to make this a two-fold point okay and in doing it he would come for a little while back in the last days the son of man okay in the days when the son of man Luke 1730 is to be revealed we're in our day and that's why Jesus come over in John and he speaks of at that day that's the day of this revelation it'll be made known all right so we come here in the end time and it's made known to us and we see son of man all right what's the next step of the journey because we God always does things in threes to keep it his numbers correct and you go to 7 for completion and all I got but he comes in three sons thing son of man prophet you know deliver the release son of God as the Holy Ghost the new birth to come and live in his church to make his church him manifest upon earth all right then he would be in the millennial reign because the iron roots whether you like it or not our roots are Jewish everything connects back to the Old Testament form of coming forth in the Jewish roots and and the things of our being coming up all right it was promised to David that his son would sit on his throne okay par phrasing just a lot of Scripture but tying it together alright the natural son of David was solomon solomon went to the throne when David you know finished his journey in Solomon it was a great Kingdom under Solomon the greatest Kingdom that ever been brought of our mankind upon the earth it was a great time there all right Solomon was the natural son of David all right but it was promised to David coming from the tribe of Judah because that would be the journey that in the tribes in the coming it was promised that a lawgiver would come forth the tribe of juda all right and see that lawgiver would be God in human flesh all right so now watch the catch on it the little woman that was standing there one day and and and they had said something and and she began to say you know he was talking to her and and she began to say you know we worship here and we worship there and he said oh that's true we said there come a time when you worship in spirit and truth all right as it began to be made known to her she had no right to call him because she was a Gentile she had no right to call him Lord he was her natural Lord which he had no right to call him the names and the things she was seeking him from what the Yeti told her he said it's promised to you Gentiles will be brought in in other words you come into the kingdom but the main thing is to the Jews Oh Bible said he came to his own and his own received in naught but as many as received him gave he power to become the sons of God all right and as it did see and here we're going now in the end time that God is turning shortly from where we are as the Gentile dispensation and the promise is to go to the Jews or because they are God's chosen people whether we like them or not or whatever it is they got them to do with it that's nothing nothing to any of us whether we don't agree with it or not we don't have any right to differ because we just left where we are the God's gonna do it all right and he's gonna come back to his people and he's going to in the millennial reign Jesus said you sit with me in my kingdom that's what they wanted they kept saying them with the women - to Jesus you know said let my son set one on one side and one on the other in your kingdom he said that's not for me to give because he knew he had to follow the correct lineup of the journey to bring forth Christ to be living in us and Jesus said he sit with me in my throne as I have overcome and sit down on my father strong all right and see in that then it would come to them niall rang in the millennial reign Jesus Christ will be sitting on the throne of David now in a millennium you have a throne a temple you have things that are made for the Millennial right the Millennium is to the Jews it's not to you and I will be there as we called it on the honeymoon you know we go up we go to the marriage supper we're getting everything finished up and we come back as to the millennial reign of a thousand years upon earth but that's to the Jews and David will be sitting on the throne now naturally where his wife his bride will be sitting around him all right that's the terms of the journey from son of man son of God and for just a little while in the end time he comes back a son of man again and then he goes to son of David all right the two the Jews have a promise and I like what one when you said about it he said I can't happen if God chose me and he's done anything do that you said well I mean if no no we didn't have anything to do where we're at God chose us but those Jews have a right to come back in because they were blinded for you and I'll according to Paul into where we could come back in they could come back in the last days after our journey of what is called the Gentile dispensation now in the Gentile dispensation that's just what it means it means Gentiles anybody can be born again in this dispensation it doesn't matter whether you Jew or your you know Mexican and in the words you want to use terminologies one you want to use Chinese or Japanese or anything anybody can be born constant it's a Gentile which means nations and nations are coming into the body of Jesus Christ all right when that's finished God will turn from there to the Jews to take out of them according to the book of Revelation 144,000 that they'll be able to have a people and you'll go into the millennial reign but my point is to get to you to remember the situation he comes as three sons name so the man from God son of David now he has many manifestations he's the Rose of Sharon the lily of the valley the bright in the morning star the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end it the father son Holy Ghost no it's the Lord Jesus Christ that's why we believe in one true and living God then jesus said I come in my father's name right well now his father must have been Jesus oh he said he just sent him now I didn't say that he said come in my father's name I mean you you send me some word you say well all right now he's passenger Lula well we're gonna send him over to the Philippines its pastor Lula well you ain't gonna get that right you know you wind up like me and wait did one time seek her way to the Sunnis in the Philippines he Samuel way del 2 seconds he and I never did like the word jr. it's all rice didn't like it so we put the two you know the dice on the end well we're going actually wound up going out west to hunt we were checking our guns in at the airport and the guy looked at the thing and he said Sam your wait day on ok he picked up way too Sam your way day all he said we got a problem he said who are you I said I'm time your way Dale he said who are you he said I'm Sam your way Dale the second see they'd forgot to put the two little lines on the airline ticket so he did had it Mike he said we got to do something he's they can't be two people on this airplane with the same name said we got to do something so they wound up and put the little lines on and sent us home my point is you ain't going did you say I'm the pastor of spoken word Church I'm going to where I want to you can't do it you gotta have a name all right you gotta have a name well see God's got a name you said well his name is God know you can make a guard out of anything the word God means an object of worship that's that's the terminologies of God it means object of worship the and and his name is Jesus what he said I come into my father's name the Holy Ghost are coming my father coming in the name of Jesus we can go through many scriptures tying together because we believe in the one true and the Living God that's what I was trying to say there he was in the Old Testament coming down dealing through the prophets when he steps into the what we would term the new testament of era or at a time across he comes forth as God in human flesh you say no no no we believe in a Trinity now that's that's what's been taught us to blind us there's no such thing as the word Trinity in the Bible it's not there there there's no God is a triune being because you are a triune being in the basis that you are the things that said your you're a son you're a father you're a human you have many titles to you and Jesus had many many titles to himself all right but his name was Jesus in my name you'll cast out devils in you know God it's the name of Jesus it's the only name that God ever had you can take the name Jesus and run it back to the Old Testament and run it back to your oversee and all of those titles and all this things they've got today you know the Yahweh's and the names and the thing if they just keep running that back they'll find it appear it right back to the very self existing Almighty God but if they'll take it the other way it'll come right straight to Jesus because there can't be many gods if it is who's the oldest one well we believe in three gods all right which one's the oldest if he's God then so we come up with the idea we had the concept see well God in three persons Blessed Trinity go week won't go eternal now how can you be co-equal you got three guards and how are you going to have co-equal how's it and call one of them a father the other a son well you're just too technical that might be true but I'm just in the Word of God so then we talk about that we don't talk about what we think all right but getting the point see that it's very vital to understand the way God comes into being to reveal himself making himself known to mankind all right you see even then the soldier that was crucifying him you remember what happened there he had more than most of them did when he's seen what took place that soldier said he must have been the son of God because he's seen all the things that had taken place and he realized there was they were crucifying but you know water we talk of the crucifix and that's what I'm not against the Jews cuz they crucify the Jews didn't crucify my god my sense is what crucified him my life my sense my being he died for me he tried to take my place he died it I don't have to die he died to release that live is expressing to where it could come back and and live in us and we could be the children of God and that's where people miss it at they're trying to find some terminologies or some great mysterious something it's not a mystery once it's made known that God can come and live in you you can come and live in you yeah but you tell it you explain it to me then how that all of this can take place you explain to me how then a cow eats green grass and gives white milk I haven't found one yet kids now don't let mom and daddy deceive you there's no such thing as a chocolate cow to give chocolate milk now that don't work somebody's trying to deceive you somewhere well how does a cow eat green rice and give white milk I don't know well I don't I didn't quit drinking the milk well because it's good see it's the point that if we follow God through his word he'll reveal himself and I'm trying to bring an issue to us now about the things of God and in the way he makes herself known and I'm not bluffing back as far as you think because I'm just using the terms a little bit different to swing it over into word that we can all follow into understanding God is trying to reveal himself he's trying to reveal himself he revealed himself there in flesh in the man we call Jesus now he was either God hurry lad well we know God can't lie so that solves the problem we must be the liars let's see God came in human flesh he came down through son of man making everything in the correct order he had to come that away for the purpose of dying but once he released that life that was within him he would not be the Son of man coming forth it was the Son of God coming forth are the spirit all right the great eternal God would come and divide itself among the humanities there and has been dividing himself ever since to where he can come and live in you and me well I just understand how you can divide God it's not like tearing up something running out of pieces you know or an apple you said in the evening and then that a while you're gonna know Apple left God's not that way he expressed it itself he took this blessed it and handed it over a little boy had this in his lunch you know he had so many fish and so many pieces of bread in his lunch now he didn't have McDonald's behind him and flooding out all of the hamburgers like we did yesterday we've got kind of funny but we got over two we left real early unless thirty minutes at least the head of where we generally run and we get over and we stop at Cracker Barrell because I love to eat Rockabye on this good old food southern and till we stopped Cracker Barrel nowhere now were later we would steal the Cracker Barrel and Danny said to the waiter said you know we've been here for a while she said she went and looked she come back she's nice because she could've just bypassed Italy she come back she said there's about six more tickets ahead of y'all that ain't even filled yet well we was done running over in the time we're supposed to be heading towards the meeting their brother languorous so you know what we're done we we asked her said would it be a fence if if we got up and left she's no don't blame you at all it won't hurt nothing No so we got up and left the only time I've ever walked out of a cafe but you know what thank God for McDonald's because we had to get a bite to eat before we got on over her so what we do we want to make novels you know they don't know how no problems you know but I'm getting the point to you if you're listening that things is right on time if we'll just believe it and listen and think about it that God is making itself known to you and I through the opening of his word he give his word those prophets brought that word coming down here comes that word walking out in human flesh we call him Jesus here he goes to Calvary releases that life and it comes back on the day of Pentecost who came back Jesus came back in the form of the Holy Ghost to live in you and I all right and then for a little bit in the last days he's the return according to Malachi 4 in the scriptures and that he was to return as son of man all right that God would be in human flesh again now not just one we don't believe brother Branham was God we teach nothing like that we're we're not stupid little idiots but not stupid we don't believe that that he was God we have no point of all of that he was the messenger that God sin just like Martin Luther was a messenger that God sent John Wesley was a messenger that God sent you know many many of those coming down coming through the Baptist and the times I knew a little bit about some of the the things and and and how that it would be you had those people in line coming through to bring the message all right and see it's nothing it's not something new it's just understanding and see everybody knows that we believe God sent a prophet that's all right that's to fulfill the scripture you know but that's okay that's no problem but we don't make him God thing that's not that away because we're we're trying to be right about it he brought a message you know John the Baptist come to introduce the Messiah right and he said behold the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world the great man John the Baptist to work he was well yet he wasn't God there's no man to be guard outside the Lord Jesus Christ and He gave His life the word that it could come back and live in you and I to reveal himself to us and reveal himself as does three sons named son of God so I mean son of man son of God son of David alright we went through the point we're picking this up for this afternoon we went through the point of understanding that according to Malachi 4 just for a little while right in the end time he's to come back as son of man because you cannot go to son of David in the millennium coming from the baptism of the Holy Ghost because no matter what you think when we get out of here those Jews is gonna have to receive Christ as their Savior if they're going to be anywhere they're gonna have to receive Christ all right same as we had to receive Christ okay all right and see then as they'll receive him as Christ the Son of the Living God through two prophets standing there they'll see that the Lord Jesus Christ is the son of man but those two people standing there won't be God then there's me two prophets coming which is Moses and Elijah coming to the Jews after we leave all right that won't be they are not God they're just like it's a vessel that God has used but Jesus was that Almighty God he said unless you believe that I am he who the one that was got to come and give his life etc all have been pretty but he said unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins I see then that way we know the who is the the god of glory and his name is Jesus so you can run in back as I said a moment ago you can go back through the Jehovah you can go through the many titles and and times of going back but I love the way the Bible I'm not against the Jehovah Witnesses I just studied the Word of God and I can't help it if I remember it but I had one talk and tell me one time you don't need talking about well Jehovah's his name I said well now first off your hope was not a name I said Jehovah was the title well he didn't because he'd never been said that to him you know and I said it's the title cuz then you got Jehovah Jireh jehova rapha jehova kiss goodness you got seven compound names of Jehovah and they ever won't apply to Jesus Christ well he was just backing up this young guy he's really interesting huh and I said what now what I like is the way the truth of it I said you're saying his name is Jehovah and I just wrote one scripture over in the Old Testament where it says by my name Jehovah was I never known he looked at me and he said I never thought of that I said cause his name's not Jehovah that's a title that's like I am Rose of Sharon lily of the valley the bright and morning star that's a title to a name but I said Jesus is his name and I said what you got has got you you got it turn because it really is j vh b rj v hu and the reason there's no vowels in there to bring it on out so they made it out to java we're putting the vowels into the letter and of its j v HD or j vh you they use it both ways and that is so sacred until when they're trying to write the bible they take a bath before they'll that word that means God they'll go take a bath they say that's really correct me in in the order of one that that Lazarus he was a scribe and that he had took so many baths till he died of pneumonia you know because every time they come to that that part is so sacred until they won't touch it till they go wash and get clean and every time we see if we'd be a little bit better off we you know we'd be better off if we've got a little more cleaner sometimes in ourselves and to think about Jesus his name was Jesus he said I come in my father's night so the father's name would be Jesus he said we have is your Jesus only no no no no no Jesus only won't work no more than the Trinity's work though Jesus only ends with Jesus in manifestation that's their terminologies when that Jesus is the life manifestation of God I differ with them the bride of Jesus Christ is the life's manifestation of God before we walk out of here off of this earth we are the life manifestation of God then God turns to the Jews and they'll be the manifestation of God upon the earth it'll be Christ in them this is Christ in you the hope of glory you see what I'm talking about see then where would we be without understanding the term our thoughts of three sons name he said well this is son of man son of God son of David well how can you go from I can understand going from Son of man to Son of God because He gave His life to do that but how are you going to go to son of David no son of David is a natural King he literally Jesus will be literally sitting on the throne of David won't be at the throne it'll be in terms of using it but manifesting himself to show who he is that he's the one that they worship see then you've got to bring in that and there's work that we understand the prophet and the message of the age and what he would bring to it and we get those thoughts from the fact that in between son of God and son of David he returns his son of man and manifest itself as son of man for a little while here in the last days until that becomes into the son of man being the bride of Jesus Christ walking on earth again not just a prophet not just one person it's God dwelling in mankind getting ready for it to step on over into the millennial reign all right but now here's for a second so wake up the to understand son of man son of God son of David it's great that's the three sons 9 but to understand the son of man son of God son of man son of David gettin picked up another God you hadn't picked up another cell you just picked up another manifestation you just picked up something god is revealing because remember that's not the end of it the millennium is the seventh day out of Eden that's time son of David is not the life form that God reveals himself has to be he's revealed yourself in Bride phone right but that's not the last form what's he gonna be in the future home the son of David in the millennium what's it going to be in the future home I'm trying to lay something down for your thoughts come on I told you I back up and then a pull up line of all right line up with the rest of it there's got to be another form of God another making known of God because in the future home it's gonna be a different world and what is he gonna reveal itself ash gotta have another forum gotta have a way to make yourself known remember we still believe the Bible whether you like it or not the Bible said God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth so remember he'll never change from being a spirit huh he didn't change there being spirit when he came into that flesh he just moved into a realm where he could be made manifest he just was brought into a position to where he could manifest himself in another out another manifestation well son of David's not the finality of all of this okay this afternoon we'll pick up on that and go on for a little bit and see cuz he's got to be something where are who is what what's he doing in the future home in the future home are we gonna go up to heaven one day like we always used to think we're Trinitarians you know and I'm not joking about it I'm not making light of them I'm just telling it like it was and way we talk alright plain language is southern we used to say well we get up to heaven we'll see Jesus sitting on the throne the father be sitting over here and the Holy Ghost will be fluttering over here like a dove yeah well now how are you gonna do that when Jesus said on my father want are you gonna do it when the Bible says the son himself shouldn't become subject we've got scriptures left it we've got a cover not trying to make a joke of anything but the truth about it we go so far in our understanding we get up to where we think we understand and then when we do here's something else comes up it's vital to understand some man strong God son of man strong David now we got to go again son of man son of God son of man son of David to the future home that God may be all and in all a scripture now I'm quoting it to you that God may be all and in all the great opportunity to try to understand God to get away from our terminologies of what we think what do you mean God God is the if God is that anybody says God well then you don't even think see and I said God is an object of worship there in human flesh would Almighty God not just an object of worship the very God Himself living on earth eating human flesh and he said I and my father are one and this is what he said he said have you seen me they said it's your father he said if you've seen me he said you've seen the father because you'll never see spirit realm you'll never see spirit you can't see spirit realm and you can't do away with the scripture that says God is the spirit spirit has to take a form he has to in morphe or change his form to work that he can manifest himself in a different way he we got a long ways to go a lot to understand take on these things come on musicians take on these things word is very important this it's our only hope or thoughts is to understand from him and to walk in the light and to know then that we we can fellowship and understand the wording how would you have felt if you'd have been Peter or something is standing there and he just said who demands out of the son of man I Peter answered what to hold a ghost a it because the church was built on the fact of son of God being God in human flesh giving the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he said Peter he said I didn't ask you that question we said that's all right said I'll build my church upon what you just say it that I'm the Christ the Son of the Living God that word Christ there means a great eternal self-existing Elohim that comes out of the beginning of the logos the theophany all of those big terminologies of words that we use which is simple God was made manifest to where we could understand him moving from one form to another until our comprehension could comprehend and once you see him standing in flesh there he is you know who that is and what's taking place let's stand oh my god of course how anybody have a need the altars open think on these things [Music] ah Universal word and [Music] what is it that's the universal sign all the way over the world and [Music] and [Music] see when I do that I'm telling you I love you I'm telling him and I love and thank you Jesus praise Him [Music] thank you [Music] Thank You Love [Music] Hey [Music] Hey [Music] father we thank you for this day and your lovin to us we pray what we said would be worthy and it was to understand all about you because that's what we're talking about we didn't come to make ourself knowns we're not to do none of that we've come to make you known Lord and we pray that you'd use the terminology is the words because we're just human beings it helps to walk in the light of your love now dismiss us as we go eat natural meals Lord bring us back together this afternoon your word father that we may walk in you we thank you and we love you in Jesus name Amen you dismiss right one for another [Music] and you
