========================================

okay okay Jesus I'm going to play games I love you every other reality is Joy take your life please I'd love and I live my home so heavily two words in what you do make often one to another in a book of remembrance with written in your dreams glad to have everybody with us come to Fellowship together we pray you'll just make yourself to home and so that's where you ought to be that's the way they say that in Tennessee it sounds kind of funny I said make yourself to home where you ought to be it sounds like they're saying you ought to go home but it doesn't mean that that way to them it means to make yourself at home like you would be at home see the way it ought to be amen or something just make our Point amen it's good to be here and good to have a good time in the lord always looking forward to the fellowship time and to know that the lord loves each and every one of us and keeps and takes care of us right Amen brother Tom come on and get started and bring your fingers on and worship and let's get just have a good time in him amen amen remember God bless you all it's good to be back in the house of the Lord today it's good to see everybody here I believe that Jesus deserves all of our praise and all of her glory that we can give them and we can never Praise Him and worship them enough amen this last year has been a wonderful year for me I broke my arm I I sprained my ankle I had a daughter who was sick I had a brother who died and through it all I can say that Jesus Christ was very faithful to me and I've never experienced such bad things and felt so good about it and uh it is because God promised that he would take care of us he wouldn't bring us through things we could not bear I seems like I learned the message new each week because it's a continual unfolding of more and more truth from God's holy word in it you know we go through stages in the message and I think about that before special meeting before a speaker comes out and maybe at first we can get a little legalistic maybe a little bit later a little bit too much grace and a little later we float up way into the too much Revelation then you kind of float back down to reality you know but these are all things if we're faithful to God he'll guide us through every bit of it because he wants a well-rounded Christian that can make it I went through stages in my life where I thought everybody outside of this message of the hour who believed in the teachings of brother Branham was false wrong Serpentine going to hell and I have learned it's not that way at all there's some very very good people who love God very very much and I've come to see them now as my brothers and sisters who weren't so the word lucky is just not going to do it they just fortunate to see this word because this word has separated us from a lot of things separated us from a lot of hurt from a lot of different people and denominations it's there are brothers and sisters who uh we are to try to take care of now as as they push the gospel forward to our age now I believe it's our turn to to help pull them forward to this age amen and it's it's a hard transition from one age to the next and I've learned that this message wasn't just to save me it was to position me so that I could do something for somebody else and if you want to be happy in this message live this message for somebody else do something that somebody else might get a closer walk with the Lord Jesus Christ then we're representing the message correctly the last thing brother Branham would have wanted was people to to to misrepresent the Gospel of Jesus Christ and so he God gave through him a clear word that people could see the the very Throne of our Lord Jesus clearly and know what needs to be done to in order to get there know what happened in the past and what's going to happen in the future we know what's happening right now shouldn't be any surprise anything on on politics and education on new diseases new Wars it's it's the same old story just different names and so we're prepared people and when we hear the word we hear it from a different view I remember one time I used to buy and sell antiques a lot and I went to this house and bought a lot of stuff from these kind kind people and they said well we have a vase it's up in the attic and I looked for that vase for three four hours one time and I come back again another time and I said can I look in the Attic yeah it's there I could never find that vase and one time I prayed about it and then I went to the little ladies and I said can I try one more time they says you've looked and looked you can't find it they says if you find it you can buy it and what I learned when I went up into that attic I finally went into the attic not as a six foot tall person but I become their height I didn't look at it through my view I've tried to look at it through their View and I said well big tall guy like me is not going to go way over here in this corner and look and he's not going to go over and I'm getting into a position from where they were looking at things and I looked and I didn't just see the one face there was four big vases and I said this is a good thing and I said and I made a lot of money out of them faces but I said that to say this we have to come into a position to see the word in the way the word was written we can't look at it through our own intellect through our own understanding we must humble ourselves down into the very anointing that the word was written by then the message of this hour just like the message of Paul's or for those folks becomes plain to us and when it becomes plain it becomes more than possible to live you become desperate to live it ah I am a I'm a Jesus freak I guess you'd call it I I can't get enough of the Bible now I I can't get enough of this truth I can't get enough of the people of God in this message so it's not time for us to bewail the challenges because we know that's what's shaping us it's building our character it's not time for us to say oh no the financial situation in the United States is going to crumble if it wouldn't crumble we'd have a false message everything that's happening is perfectly in line with what's been prophesied both in the Bible and in this end time message so it's all going along perfectly my goodness we can't hardly eat a meal without it causing cancer or or trouble just like what was said we are suffering a physical corruption in the natural types of spiritual in the world around us spiritually is being corrupted and out of that corruption should walk a people who have heard the voice of God for this day amen who heard God's microphone that they might meet the one the King of Kings and the Lord of lords amen so I'm glad to be part of that amen and I'm glad that God's still a Healer and that God brings us through things when people pass away and when people get hurt and this whole body is getting older but no I'm not going to give up basketball yet I'm not going to give up Sports yet I'm not I've got young boys they need to see their dad out there we've got something to do Brothers we've got a position to hold be a dad to your children you want to win them to the message be a father to them mothers you want them in the message or do you want them to split by the time they're 18. live the message in front of them this thing must be seen it must be heard it must be lived before him and God help us when we make mistakes make sure they see you repent but I can go on and on I just love the Lord with all my heart I really appreciate brother Samuel Dale and all the brothers and I just consider myself very fortunate to even being part of this and I say God bless the King of Kings our lord Jesus I guess my girls have a song and brother Bradley come on up thank you empty and broken I came back to him a vessel unworthy so scarred from sin but he did not despair he started over again and I Bless The Day He Didn't Throw the Clay Away away over and over Fashions the place of Honor I am today and it's all because Jesus Didn't Throw the Clay Away he is image into his likeness guess all of Honor I is today and it's all because Jesus amen you ever watched a Potter sometimes he's got a break it down but you know what he uses the same thing to make a beautiful pot just has to be according to his making come on brother Tony greet the people and bring your singers you notice I'm not shaking hands in my right hand I kind of got messed up with a drill the other day so I told everybody I didn't want them squeezing too hard I give him my left hand praise the Lord how many love the Lord Jesus I just bless the Lord for a lot of pains that he done this year's been a challenging 2013 been it's been rough and now I've gone through it all and we see the power of the Lord moving also we lost a very dear sister is listening he didn't call me back then um sister Gladys has been here several times with us and the Lord took her home who was really hard cutting she led her life very faithful sister at a job she was working she did the first job and she had a part-time job so she moved to the second one and then was working and singing praising God like as usual and then suddenly the heart so she have called me said bro Tony please can you keep me in prayer we call the ambulance and this happened you know happened several times every time it happened she called me and we pray a little bit and then the ambulance will come it take over and everything so this time around she couldn't make it to the emergency and uh one of his children had called me later an hour later said bro Tony you can't believe my my mother is gone it was really hard but we bless the Lord for everything I appreciate the saying to the prayer for us there is something here I want to read um give me the problem said in this message sir we will see Jesus and just a little quality I want to read but Brian said I believe you can climb up the tree of science until you get to the end of it then you step over on the tree of faith and just keep on climbing I said because I believe in climbing up the tree and I believe that's what the sister actually believes we have to do we have to get on the tree of faith amen right it's an unlimited tree and keep climbing he said and I escaped he said the whole Christian armor is faith I was saying he says see what is the Christian armor it says love joy peace Faith long-suffering meekness gentleness patience Holy Spirit he said God angels you say it's all Supernatural so things about Christians the world can understand right sometimes it Beyond us beyond our families to be yours our friends but it's one thing the Lord has given that we can hide this revealed word that

nine of us siblings in my family two of them's done crossed over but you know not a one of the rest of them has anything to do with this I thought it could only be by election God through his great foreknowledge and predestinated plan knew before we ever got here now you've been to God that amen that seed would be of receiving the word of God you know and desire that we're living in and I thought my all I want to do is cry thank you Lord amen so going back and I was listening brother Homer to uh some 54 and 55 tapes the other day and brother bran was getting into the discernment line

we got everybody in tonight going pretty good maybe we get to eat a little early or we give brother Jonathan a whole lot of time go ahead I didn't jump up and run out there and Shake brother uh Homer's hated a while ago like a but I do love you I love all of them but you know when this internet stuff you know you get something and they say if you get three back you know you know they love you if you get five back boy and if you get 10 boy you're doing great you know but you know I sent one out the other day I think I got two or three back but the first one I got back was from Home Alone yeah and I appreciate you God bless you yeah amen and amen and amen yeah so uh brother Homer you do have some good points don't you can't send an internet let's stand and sing a song and we'll take up the offering now the offering tonight most of you have heard that the brother be taken care of by the church but most of you have heard that brother Rocky from the Philippines passed away the other day and some of you saying that you didn't maybe you didn't know but you know they were trying to get money up to send over to him and brother Dutch had already sent some trying to get to where that he could take some treatments but he refused to even take the treatments he had liver cancer he refused to take the treatments he wouldn't even do it he let him put had him to put the money into the missionary fund and he wouldn't have the treatments to be done but he passed away the other day and we've all I know have and we have we've done sent some but the offering tonight will go to the family there a brother Rocky I cannot pronounce his last name but he's to me he was the biggest one of the Philippine guys you go over there and everybody's short and he at least stood up above and he was wonderful brother and I really appreciate him so what we're going to do is just let the offer in tonight go to you know to the brother's family to be able to uh help a little bit in their burial expenses into different things so if you have anything if you want to give if you come brother Kylie would you come and receive the offering who will make sure that it gets to the family and everything go ahead Heavenly Father we are grateful thank you Philippines so I'll be knowing that you are able Lord in this day Lord we asked you that as we grow strong what but we always have you guys coming true steps foreign amen this is the one way that I believe why would you invite a minister to come and preach if you didn't believe he was going to bring the word of the Lord that's the way I think you know there would be no need of gathering there'd be no need of coming together and and all if we were just gonna not believe that the finality of it all the fellowship is wonderful we love it but to hear the word of the Lord and see I believe the way that God will speak tonight to us is through our brother because he's been chosen for the part and God will use him the gift will be there so then that's what we ought to think about it right that God will speak to us tonight through our brother glad to have brother Jonathan Jones with us I love you don't maybe know him he was brother Jimmy Gibson's son-in-law so let's make it to where you'll you kind of get connections back together you should have seen that when sister came up and sing you know and all that we really appreciate old brother Jimmy I really really loved him he was a wonderful brother he was a great guy and I just appreciate him we'll meet on the other side but this let's just sing Open the Eyes of My Heart as brother Jonathan Jones comes to speak the word of the Lord unto us this night right oh
