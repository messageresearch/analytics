fantastic well this this afternoon I want to read from the Amos chapter 3 and we'll just take a take a little subject of are you on God's list let's just bow our hearts and our heads oh God we're so grateful to be able to gather around once more around your word and we just ask your blessing Lord Lord we we certainly we've got the letters here on the page Lord but Lord we we we need you to open the book and give us the true essence of it and Quicken it to our hearts and and our lives Lord to give us the true meaning of these things that we read about Lord what would service be without your spirit moving Among Us Lord and we just invite you now Lord to Lord to be present with us and to help us Lord and to make this service a real Church worship service where we can have Liberty with you Lord God Lord you've given us something to worship about you have given us a true revelation of what these things are that we read about and we just ask your blessing now on your word in your name amen so we'll read in Amos 3: 1-8 it says hear this word that the Lord hath spoken against you oh children of Israel against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt saying you only have I known of all the families of the earth therefore I will will punish you for all your iniquities can two walk together except they be agreed will a lion roar in the forest when he ha no prey while a young lion Crow up his den if he have nothing if he ha taken nothing can a bird fall in a snare upon the Earth where no J is for him shall one take up a snare from the earth and have taken Nothing At All Shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall shall there be evil in this city and the Lord ha not done it surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord God hath spoken who can but prophesy you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now if you don't know who Amos was I'm go ahead and take my shackles off if you don't know who Amos was Amos was a prophet that he said he actually said I I'm not a prophet or a son of a prophet and that's kind of a strange thing for a prophet to say but he said he made that statement because he wanted to make sure that everybody knew that he didn't go to the schools of the prophets he wasn't he wasn't like a professional Prophet that got paid to say the right thing to people and I I I just thank God that there's true god- calleded people that will tell the truth it doesn't matter whether they get paid money for it or not money or whether they uh whe whether this or that whether they're popular or not popular you think this scripture this verse uh verse 8 the lion has roared who will not fear the lord God has spoken but who can but prophesy and brother Brandon would use this to kind of uh nail nail people's hides to the wall when he preached that message uh spiritual Amnesia he was he was nailing everybody's hide to the wall there in Birmingham Alabama as he was uh exposing their doubt and their disbelief I think thank God that we' we've got a prophet in this last day uh you know brother rown would would uh he would would explain over and over that ministers were so confused and then God gave a sin a prophet and you know we we take that people take that around the land sometimes and they'll take it as well ministers are just confused period well that's why we needed a prophet to come cuz when you have a prophet then that removes the confusion and thank God that we've got a prophet because now we've got something to preach it's taking away our confusion that now we know what we believe amen and you you see all these things that that Amos was was uh another thing about Amos he he was put out of the northern kingdom they they didn't like his preaching so they just put him out and Amos got into the rather odd position that he instead of being able to preach he had to write and so if you heard what Amos preached you would hear it by by maybe somebody reading one of his his messages or you uh you reading it yourself so uh thank God for the a message that you can read and and and get into your for yourself and and amos's position was he he right there at the time of the great prosperity in Samaria uh he was preaching in a time where Israel had gotten so where they got so much money and so much they they just got real soft and they had everything that they needed and they started getting away from God this was during a time of the great prosperity in Samaria Israel had prospered is what brother Adam said and he would go on to say he'd say not always Prosperity is a sign of spiritual blessings but sometimes on the contrary now you go back and study out all the things that brother brandham would say about prosperity and he really didn't have that much good to say about Prosperity you you whenever whenever you know we we know that the love of money and the root is the root of all evil and there's nothing wrong with having money or saving for your retirement and those kind of things but but you watch just it's pretty consistent as soon as Prosperity come somebody get starts getting Pro prosperous it it it will brother BR would even make this statement he said Prosperity all always ruins people that's a hard thing to say he would say but but Prosperity takes a man away from God and you think even just looking around and observing that you can see the effect that Prosperity has has has had on this layout of say an age that we're living in that because we have a lot of money now now our kids don't go play in the dirt like they used to now they go play with an iPad used to we'd play in the yard until our mama would tell us to go play outside until the street lights come on and we'd run around with our friends and act act like good the good kind of hoodlums until the street lights came on and but now now that I remember playing with the dirt cuz I didn't have any I didn't have any you know nice toys or anything just scooting around little rocks and stuff in the in the dirt but now what do we do we babysit our kids with iPads and and iPhones and they get to watching stuff that they shouldn't be watching and and and you don't know you don't know what they're saying on Tik Tok or or or Instagram or whatever cuz they're messaging your friends and you got to you got to to spend so much time staying on top of that and it's impossible how you going to how you going to observe everything that they do sneaking around do you see what Prosperity does prosperity will take you further and further away from God and brother BR would say another thing he would say we forget God when Prosperity comes cuz you you you start getting real soft and LAX you oh you oh you start giving your kids great big old gifts and stuff and until they get to the point where they think that that that life owes them a favor and you oh you see because you've got so much money you could you have the luxury to be able to just give them a great big nice car when they go old enough or just give them a great just everything they need a new suit so give them that they need everything they need they need and they start depending well life just owes me a favor one day I'm going to need a job and well somebody's going to have to give me a job but that that ain't that ain't the case is it but because you've got money and because you've got Prosperity you begin to depend upon your own self and your own Works instead of depending upon God that's one thing we noticed when we were down in Nicaragua they they didn't have any money they they got to depend on God they can't they don't have no uh Health Plan where they can go to the doctor and say well they they'll just pay for whatever do experiment all you want do whatever but no they got to depend on God for what they have need of and that's what they affect that Prosperity oh that's what Amos was preaching at he was preaching at a day much like ours when people had got so prosperous that they had everything they wanted they had oh today you look around in the parking lot and everybody's got a nice car I'm not preaching on you brother way but it's just a sign of the times it's a sign of the times that we got we've got I mean I got a nice car too that's how we all we're all in the same boat here we've got we got nice things but brother Rand said God doesn't promise ease and prosperity but he promises Grace to endure in every trial my wife and I were listening to a a preacher the other day and he was talking about how that if you really have confidence in God that God will give you money and prosperity and I was like what what there is no promise there's no promise in the Bible of prosperity we're not Prosperity preachers you you can't there's no promise of that look what brother Brown saying you can't have you there's no there's no confidence that God will give you a lot of money but he will give you Grace to endure every trial Now isn't that what the Rich Young ruler's problem was he had all this money and he was unwilling to even give up a little bit so that he could get what really mattered in life eternal life he he he was he was unwilling to to sell all he had and start and give to the poor because his wealth his what he had in this life was worth more and that's what Prosperity does brother Brown would say Amos we don't have any history where he come from we know he according to the scripture he's a herdsman he was a herds he was a fig tree farmer and he was a cattle farmer and that's why he said I I'm not a prophet and I'm not a son of the prophet he he was a nobody that God plucked out of nowhere ain't that just how God does I what I'm talking about tonight is being able to identify your in the scripture yourself in the scripture and when we read these stories you can put your own self in the scripture and say I I you know what I I I lived through that I was in nobody and God what am I doing now come on let I'm I'm going preach on myself a little bit what am I doing up behind the pullit how did I get here I was a nobody I if y'all could go back in my life and remember when I started coming to this church and you know people poking at me and all that kind of stuff I I I'm nothing I'm I'm nobody but and that's how God does everybody he'll take somebody that ain't nothing like David and take somebody like Amos or whatever and and and and and and and give them a life experience so they can share it with others and be an influence to others and and brother BR would say on one hot day in Samaria there the one of the great tourist cities of the world at that day he wasn't looking at what tourists usually see oh a that how we do when we go to like a Beach town or we go to Florida somewhere we go to Pigeon fors or whatever uh the tourist is going to be looking for some entertainment a little place to go a nice place to go eat or a place to go get some good entertainment maybe go on a little zipline or walk on some kind of bridge that goes over the mountain or something like that but that wasn't what Amos was interested in he got up there oh if you could look at Pigeon Fords like Amos was looking at it if you could look at Myrtle Beach like Amos was looking at it Amos would look at those things like like a prophet would look at it he was looking at the morality the moral Decay the situation that Prosperity had caused yeah they had a lot of they had a lot of wealth and things oh but you go with Myrtle Beach you go to any Beach town you go to any place any place like that and look at the the condition that the world has got in he said he found them so decayed and so morally corrupted he said everything that God had expected out of him they had went right the other way now now we go to Myrtle Beach and I'm not I'm not preaching on Myrtle Beach I I'm just I'm flying off the coast but we go off to those places and and and and we're looking at you know worldly people and everything but Amos was looking at people that were supposed to be Believers now there's where the problem is you know I think one of the one of the worst things to look at is not an unbeliever is it's somebody that's a make believer a good pH a Pharisee is one of the worst things that's talked about in the Bible I'm a Christian and yet you're living a moral horrible looking life and and a shame and a reproach to the to what Christianity stands for that's what Amos was looking at you're supposed to be better than this you're supposed to be you're supposed to be an example to the world you're supposed to be oh today you're supposed to be Christ on display and to look at what Prosperity has caused what the corruption that has set in and you know moral Decay if you look online it says moral decay occurs when the accepted Norms of right and wrong virtue and vice begin to erode or weaken over time leading to a decline and ethical behavior and a breakdown of moral Integrity in other words you just turned into just horribleness just a stew of iniquity and filth and and brother R would say he said we're not supposed to act like the rest of the people we are different we are a different character oh I thank God that God's given us by the power of the Holy Ghost the ability to change that's what that's what the the message the Paradox that I was preaching Wednesday night up there in in South Carolina well God God wants to change us he wants to make you different he wants to make you holy like himself and he's given us the recipe for that his word his word will go out and grab you and begin to pull you into himself and begin to change your life because God oh he just won't settle for you being the same as the world he won't settle for it you know you see out on as you drive by different churches they got their signs out that say just come as you are well that's fine you come as you are you you of course we got different standards that that you can't just come in here like they do over at Lake lanir and come in your bathing suit or nothing you can't do that but listen when you come when you come you won't remain as you are something's going to change either you get worse or you'll get better cu the word is going to have an effect in your life and when you come to the house of God when you come and you stay God requires Holiness God requires Holiness from the front to the back the ministers got to be holy the people have to be holy everybody's got to be holy or the thing won't work right now listen this will be a little bit scalding for me to read these quotes but here it comes so wake up Rouse yourself don't get don't don't don't get droopy eyes this fast we're only 10 minutes in hang in there with me and Jehovah JRA he said God did one thing after he chose Abraham he called for separation and that's one thing God does when he calls any man or woman separate yourself from the world get out from among your Kindred he said to Abraham and I'll bless you and if you'll notice he never did bless Abraham till he separated himself from all of his Kindred lot and all oh that so that means means if you want to be blessed if you want to receive a blessing from God you got to separate yourself oh now that you start off in your journey separating just a little bit but then God starts carving things off and as long as you'll stay under subjection to the word he'll separate you more and more and more until you're till you're just complete Oneness with God and fully separated from the world but you got to be separated you can't be you can't be flirting around with the world on one hand and and well I wish I wish that I could just take a little ttty every now and then I wish that I could dress like them I wish that I could I could go just enjoy a nice swim at the beach or something with my in my Skippy clothes listen I'm talking about that God will change your desire so you don't want to do those things anymore I I I I thank God that by the by The Prophet's message and by what we're reading here in the Bible that we've got the ability to preach a message of Holiness God wants us to be holy that's what that's what that little baby form sanctification is to take that unclean Spirit out of your soul so that you'll have the right kind of desire that God can fill you with his faith so that you can be positioned to believe but then God continues that work of sanctification on your in your life as you begin to move up that stature of perfect man and then even even when you're capped even in adoption God continues the sanctification cuz he's got to completely separate you from everything of the world completely separate what are you talking about brother Bob I'm talking about when Jesus was there crying out in the Garden of Gethsemane should I should I separate from my will my will Lord not let thy will be done not my will and you got to be separated from that you got to be separated from your own will in the Ephesian Church age brother R said the way of God is Holiness let this be known to every member here of the body of Christ until you live a holy life God refuses your sacrifice so you think coming here this morning this afternoon that if you want to be acceptable to God you got to be you got you got to be Sanctified you got to be purged you got to be purified so you might as well just let God have his work in you cuz without that you'll never be acceptable to God the sacrifice must be holy with holy hands and First Corinthians oh Paul really laid it out to the Corinthians as he was trying to straighten things up oh the Corinthians needed some sanctifying all right they had all kinds of problems when Paul got to them but Paul would lay it out he said Purge out therefore the old living all everything from your wrong Doctrine to your wrong idea your the wrong living Purge it all out that you may be a new lump as you are unle for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us and he said for but now I have written unto you not to keep company if there's somebody in your company that's living in fornication living in adultery somebody that's railing against their wife that's that can't hardly keep from having a conversation with their wife without busting a hole in the wall somebody that's C us always going around trying to look at everybody else's cars and talking about how they can get that and he said don't even eat with that person listen what Paul said he said but now I have I have written unto you not to keep Company If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or Covetous or an idolor or a or a drunkard or an extortioner with such in one know not to eat now Paul's not say he say if you go read 1 Corinthians chapter 5 he's not saying that that we shouldn't be a witness to people in the world but he's saying when somebody comes into the house of God and they begin to confess and profess that they are a Christian but yet they won't live a holy life you cannot you cannot endorse that oh see isn't that what the devil wants to do the devil wants to find an endorsement that's why the devil will always come to a minister or somebody can you can you bless my life can you bless the way that I'm living but Paul was saying I cannot endorse Unholy living there ain't no way according to the Bible to endorse Unholy living brother and Paul brother BR said this old little old fell Amos coming up over the hill was coming to tell them thus saith the Lord clean this thing up or you're going into captivity oh you got to live a clean life you got to live a clean life or when you come into the house of God you'll be uncomfortable cuz you get preached on it's going to be preached on I'm preaching on tonight if there's anything that you're uncomfortable with and clean it up clean it up and then it won't be preached clean it up and then you won't feel uncomfortable when you come into the house of God cuz we got to line up with the word we got to be separated from anything that's off the word and line up exactly until we're living a holy life a life that Amos wouldn't be ashamed to look at and again what I'm talking about tonight is identification what are you identified with when I preach these things are you identified with a holy life or are are you identified with a life of moral Decay and filth what kind of a life are you identified with when you hear the preaching of the Gospel does something well up on the inside and say that's oh I believe that that's the truth and I'm identified with that or do something maybe rile up and say well I don't like him for telling me telling me the truth something rile up with oh you see see the more I I've gone around preaching lately the more it's become real to me that ministers should not care about the reaction of the people it's got to be laid out whether it's whether you like it or not it's got to be laid out because it'll do you good one way or another it might be scald and but it help it might help you get to the altar it might help you give give give your life to God it might help you die a little bit which is what brother way told me before I come out he said kill us cuz we need a die we got to die to ourselves now you go online and you look at all these symptoms of moral Decay I'm going to read all these symptoms of moral Decay but they're attributes and attributes are all a symptom of sin if you roll it all up it's the umbrella of sin when you disbelieve it will cause an effect the reason why you ain't living a holy life the reason why you can't you can't do it is because you disbelieve so you see the antidote is a believe if you believe God's word then it'll fix your conduct it'll fix the way that you it'll begin to affect a change in your life now symptoms of moral Decay are a shift away from ethical principles and values that guide individuals and societies and making moral decisions people won't even people won't even be able to live with their spouse if you're not if you're an immoral person before long the devil start putting in a in a wife or a husband's mind well maybe I just I I missed out years ago when I when I I missed out on a lot of fun I want to go experiment and have a little fun come on don't be looking at me weird this is how the devil this this is how the devil does he'll put it he'll put something in your mind and and before long that's a symptom of prosperity the effect that Prosperity has on people the moral decay of people's minds a decrease in virtuous traits such as honesty Integrity compassion and empathy a rise in behaviors that are considered unethical such as lying cheating stealing and exploiting others that's what a Christian is not going to lie and steal and cheat CU because you're a Believer and a Believer it believing the word will have an effect in your life it will it will come out it will it will work its way out a lack of respect weakening of Family Ties acceptance of behaviors that may cause harm to oneself or others a decrease in personal and Collective accountability you'll say well I I'm not accountable for my own actions is somebody else's fault a't that what the moral Decay you start blaming somebody else I want somebody else is responsible for what's happening in my family I'm going blame the ministry I'm going to blame maybe my grandparents I'll blame my parents somebody else and that's a symptom of mortal Decay when you won't be account for your own action and brother B will say what is sin friend those all those things are not sin those are attributes of sin sin is when you disbelief and your disbelief will cause an attribute it'll cause something to be manifested in your life what is sin friend smoking cigarettes is not sin drinking whiskey is not sin committing adultery is not sin that's the attributes of sin he that believeth not is condemned already unbelief is sin is that right you do those things because you don't believe he say it another place there's only one sin that's unbelief sir sir any man if he lives as holy and Pious now listen to how he word this any man if he lives as holy and Pious and as good as he could be that's why I I so often preach against goody two shoes I'm against goody twoo we're not good preaching a goody two shoes message and yet say that the day of Miracles is passed and deny the scripture saying Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that man is a sinner because he's an unbeliever so when you disbelieve God's word that makes you a sin now now a lot of this this might be kind of background for a lot of this but you know I love to hear something preach that I believe in so y'all don't draw up on me when I'm preaching something that you might have heard a thousand times encourage encourage the preaching so that maybe somebody that ain't Hur it like you have maybe they can get a blessing you really pull on the word you know sometimes sometimes I'm not gonna go brother R said before we had any sin we had no sickness after sin came then sickness was the attributes of sin and Amos what was Amos doing Dr Amos was down there diagnosing the situation and he could see what the problem was the prosperity and the moral Decay had caused a condition where they wasn't living right because they wasn't believing right he said Amos found them with a bad case of a disease spiritual amnesia and that's just exactly what we got today he said the diagnosis proves what it is when people get away from God and won't listen to the word have no more desire for the word then there is one diagnosis to it the soul that sendeth that Soul shall die listen to what he said and won't listen to the word and have no more desire for the word now just going around to different churches I think that's the worst predicament that you can just about get into is where you sit in a church and you just don't care anymore you're sitting in church and you're there you're there but you just don't really care anymore when you have no more desire for the world oh God Deliver Us from predicament like that I don't ever want to get to where I'm cold and drawn up and don't don't want to don't want to say Amen in church and just don't want to care anymore if there's anything that I want to do I want to at least care I care about my soul I care about your soul I care and I believe God cares too and brother brother R said he knew what the disease was when he seen the disease of sin in the city what the what the disease was is that were not able to identify themselves now when you can't identify yourself in other words who am I where where did I come from who are my parents what am I like what is your identification they were unable to identify themselves now he called that spiritual Amnesia now come on now that's that's what I'm preaching on this afternoon is spiritual Amnesia and Amnesia was when somebody doesn't know who they are are now brother B would lay out for us all these ways that you can get spiritual Amnesia and he say one of them is shocked like a like a a military Soldier going overseas and you know many of us maybe even in this church might be acquainted with somebody that went overseas and they saw maybe a lot of children dying or horrible things horrible and and you just get into a State of Shock if you've ever seen one of those pictures of a World War II fighter that that got Shell Shocked they were in the trenches and they just come out and they all they were doing was staring and they wouldn't blink or nothing they couldn't even interact with somebody because they had seen such horrible things and I began to meditate on this what what was brother brandham talking about when he said that spiritual Amnesia could come from shock and I I put on my headsets and I was I was going out listening to a book in the yard and I was listening to the book hard cases which is a book about um hard spiritual cases that that Christian counselors have dealt with by quoting the scripture and that book makes a case uh I'm not trying to promote a book or nothing maybe I shouldn't even mention the title because somebody get the wrong idea or something but that book is promoting the idea it's against the idea that that we need Psychology or drugs to help with situations all we need is the Bible and the Bible is sufficient in itself to help whether somebody's dealt with horrible sexual trauma being abused as a child whether they're dealing with with uh uh uh wanting to kill themselves or anything and and they were relaying in this book all these cases and one of the cases that it kind of started off with was this case of this young woman that had just been through some horrible things and what happened was she went from counselor to C these supposed to be Christian counselors and they were giving her drugs and counseling her all these and it was it turned if I could just relate to you it was absolutely terrible the things that they had subjected this girl to because they didn't believe in the sufficiency of the scripture to counsel somebody in a situation like that and in one case they even they they diagnosed her with multiple personality disorder and one of the doctors that is supposed to be a Christian counselor he started he he wanted to bring out each of her personalities and have a have a discussion with each of those personalities and interview it and you think oh just so many other things that left her so scarred by the end of it and I think what what what shocks people what scars people is things like that wrong doctrine that people have been left with as they go from church to church and place to place strange Doctrine and mistreatment and abuse traumatic events lead to shock inability to cope lack of support oh but when you get with the real truth of what the gospel is about oh when when that when that girl when that girl in this story was when they when they shared with her the real essence of what the gospel is about that your sins have been washed away that God don't hold you guilty if you repented and begin to lay it out for her then then she got the real help that she needed and that's that's why we're preaching tonight that's what we're preaching today and every time we come to church we're preaching a gospel that is intended to help you because we believe in the sufficiency of scripture what am I talking about tonight this afternoon i'me I'm preaching about being able to identify yourself with the word and when you can't identify yourself with the word then you forget who you are and where you come from another thing that'll cause it is worry when you when you don't believe the word of God and you you're not resting you're the Bible says cast all your cares on on him and when you fail to do that and you start taking it upon yourself you start worrying worrying will cause you to go into a place where you just you don't realize who you are you're unable to identify yourself with the Bible brother Bram said worry will cause it worry has no virtue to it at all someone said well now what if you're going to be shot in the morning wouldn't you worry I said no don't think so why I said worry couldn't do nothing but make me worse well what good is it going to do to have faith I said it might deliver me oh if we could if we could have that kind of an attitude when we get to into a fix at work or a fix when our home if you worry will not do it will not solve any problems it will not do anything but Faith might deliver you Isaiah chapter 41 God told us through the prophet fear not for I am with you be not dismayed for I am your God I will strengthen you I will help you I will uphold you with my righteous right hand now that's a scripture that we can that'll give us confidence in the hour of worry to Cast Away our worry and just believe in 1 Peter 5:7 he said casting off all your care or anxieties cast all your anxieties on him because he cares for you and Luke 12 says which of you by being anxious can add a single being worrisome can add a single hour to your span of Life what good is be being worried going to do if then you aren't able to do a small thing as that why are you worried about the rest why are you anxious about that he said worry follow sin when you don't believe you start worrying worry follow sin did you ever notice what a horrible thing worry is there's not one value in it at all he said the human heart was made to be happy worry will cause cancer cuz your heart was made to be peaceful and content to be joyous to be happy content oh I think that's one of the greatest blessings that God can give somebody is just to be content whether you got a cardboard box to sleep on where you got a mansion around you be content with whatever God gives you because worry is cancer temper will cause cancer don't never be upset just walk in love Martin Luther said pray and let God worry Charles Spurgeon said anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its Sorrows but only empties today of it strength dietr boner said worry is always a sign that your trust in God has shifted to trust in your own strength and Thomas kind of said anxiety is the greatest evil that can befall a soul except sin that's why in Philippians chapter 4 it says be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God and the peace of God which passes all passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus Matthew chapter 6 said take therefore no thought for the marrow for the tomorrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof so don't worry about it put it in God's hands God will take care of it aren't you glad you've got a God that can take care of things that you're worried about or you're stewing about that keep you up at night all now I think that's one of the remedies when you're remedies for insomnia when you're laying awake at night and all these problems are rolling through your head just get on your knees for a little bit and throw it on God's shoulders and you'll find that weight lifted you'll find yourself all cleaned up when you rise up and everything's taken care of and you can rest the worry's been taken away you can rest knowing that it's in God's hands and now that's really what faith is sometimes you know people want they get all wound up trying to work things out how do I know who to marry how do I know where to live how do I know what church to go with but faith faith if you really know what faith is Faith rests in knowing that God will take care of it if if I know that that there's a promise in the Bible that the spirit of truth will lead and guide me into all truth then I can have confidence that he's going to take me from point A to point B that's what faith is I I I believe that he's going to do that how do I know because he said it and that's what my faith is resting in not in my worry not in my not in looking back at all these shockful events of things saying hurtful things and ministers that are saying things that are off off the word and looking around at all the circumstances and things but just resting solely in God's word because because that's where I get my identification from oh when you when you hear the gospel preach like that something begins to Echo in your heart and you begin to recognize I I identify with that I identify that's what I'm preaching about this afternoon brother bam said another thing that will cause you to get amnesia is getting between two opinions where you don't know what to do see it's it's because you're getting away from Faith you you don't have confidence in what God's word says so you don't know what to do do I stay home and listen to tapes or do I come to church what what do I do do I do I need to do I need to listen sit under a Ministry do I need to wear a dress in a certain way according to uh 1 Corinthians thir 1 Corinthians 11 do I need to change the way that I dress do I need to change do I need to put on some clothes when I go to the ocean do I do I need to change things oh when you don't know though that's getting between two opinions God wants you to know and have confidence in the direction that your life is going in in First Kings chapter 19 Elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt you between between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him if the Lord be God follow him but if bail and follow him which one are you going to do there's the choice that's been presented to every one of us which way are you going to cast your vote you going to cast your vote for God are you going to cast your vote for the devil and the people answered him not a word isn't that a shocker the people just looked at him sometimes like how people look when you're preaching the gospel they just look I'm not I'm not trying to be nasty y'all y'all know what I mean in James 1:6 he said he said he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways a double-minded man is a man who is always trying to be on both sides at once he's sitting on top of the fence he's he's not really committed either way he's he's wanting to say he's a Christian and come to church but when he goes home he maybe he'll flirt around around with the world and do some stuff with some girl that he ain't supposed to be doing sitting right on the fence not not fully committed either way a divided heart loses Both Worlds the one above and the one below is what another Theologian said a divided heart loses both world if you're divided you don't know which way to go and the power of decision brother BR said if a man once anchors his heart against the heart of Calvary all devils in hell will never Shake him no more he's there notice for he that cannot stand chastisement is an illegitimate child that's what we're reading this morning he claims God to be his father when he's not just tossed about by every wind of Doctrine not stable and don't know where you're going double-minded and a lot of times double tonged and don't know where you're standing or what you're talking about then a man that's born again of the spirit of God knows exactly where he's at now if you're in a place where if you can identify with those things I'm talking about that of a double-minded person now wouldn't you want to be identified with a place where you can know what you're talking about and be identified with the word of God and have that kind of peace that when you go to bed at night you're not worried about your Eternal destination brother said that's right nothing faces him because something inside of him has already witnessed somebody outside the cloud younger and by faith he sees him now we've got to be identified we're going to be either identified with the moral Decay and the symptoms of sin or we're going to be identified with the word of God brother say we are identified with our families in this human life by marriage we are identified with our wives we marry and our family is identified by the union of our marriage that means when my wife married me she took my name and now she's identified by my name you're identified by your family when my my kids and you know I I've got three girls but until they get married they're identified by my name and they know who their daddy is because they carry my name and my son carries my name because he's identified with me he come forth from me but brother Brown said what if you couldn't remember remember what if you got to a place where you just couldn't remember your spouse or your family or your children you couldn't remember your that oh come on now go with me we're we're not talking about things of the natural we're talking about do you do you recognize that you come from your daddy above do you re do you know where you come from and he said when you get this amnes you might get like Nebuchadnezzar it was who exalted himself one time and God let him think he was an animal but you know you can be identified with an animal like Nebuchadnezzar but what separates an animal from a from a man an a man a human being has a soul that identifies you you you know you're a human that you ain't some animal because there's something down on the inside that get that pricks you when you do wrong something that give you got a thirst that's thirsting after something thirsting that can only be that Holy thirst that can only be quenched by the word of God so maybe this afternoon if you got that thirst that's pulling at you there's oh won't you just won't you just come to the Fountain and be drink from that water of everlasting life brother R said you got something down inside a conscience that tells you what's right and wrong and Nebuchadnezzar had forgotten that he was a human being he thought he was an animal so he acted like an animal Now isn't that how a lot of people at these vacation spots do they don't know that they got a soul and they need a God and so what they do is they just act like an animal they got their biker week and everything where they're acting like an animals they got all that they got all their the way that they dress and the way that they act they're acting like animals oh but let God get a of you and he'll cause you to realize that you ain't an animal that you're you're a CH a son or a daughter of God and a son or a daughter of God is going to act like they're daddy you know my my children they can't help I I can't help but just like brother Aaron was talking about this morning you can't help but display the attributes of your father in even in the natural and in the natural my children can't help but in some degree act like act like me you know we've got some of my wife's jeans in there too but you know they're going to like my son looks like me you can tell he's mine because he he's he's my child and we forget sometimes what the Christian church is brother say we act like the world that shows that we got spiritual Amnesia because that you don't act like the Christian you act like the world you receive the heart of the world and it causes this how's a Christian supposed to act we're supposed to love one another love one another as I have loved you Jesus said we're supposed to tell the truth is what Proverbs 12:22 says tell the truth a Christian is going to tell the truth in Matthew 6:14 we're going to forgive one another forgive them in their trespasses that's how a Christian acts see when you forget those things oh but if you if you're doing those things and you see that manifested in your life you can identify with the scripture that's what I'm talking about you know where you come from when you identify yourself in the scripture and loneliness of mind let us esteem each other better than themselves oh when you can look at your brother and say I I want more for him that I want for myself I want him to have the better place at the table I want him to have the better food the better cut of steak I wanted him to have the better everything you put your brother before you I want to get down on my knees and wash his feet because I'm putting everybody else ahead of me and that's what a real Christian Life in Colossians 3:12 a Christian what's a Christian a real Christian is just sum it all up it's going to be good because it says put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bows of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye and Israel had exposed got exposed to the world and had fell into this rad brother and we say that Israel was like there in Ezekiel chapter 16 it relates this story of of how there was like a little girl that was in her blood and just a mess that God found on the side of the road and pulled up put in a palace cleaned up uh give everything that she had need of and that was what Israel was like and yet she turned around and just because she had all this Prosperity she forgot oh God don't want us to forget you get into a place where you got a cushy masage chair and a nice nice big weighted blanket and a nice little heating pad at home and you start forgetting think oh some that's what we were talking about sometimes God will get you put you through a little place where to uh squeeze you a little bit so that you remember remember where you come from and brother R said God by his grace chose Israel from all the rest of the families on the earth Grace had did that he had given them the choice lands he gave them houses that they never had to build he gave them Farms that they never bought he gave them he gave them food that they never planted he gave them whales that they never dug he gave them victories that they never won he gave them Grace that they never married merited and after God showed all these mercies to her and she got rich she got amnesia and she forgot all about where these things come from oh you ever just get along with God and just begin to thank him for everything you know sometimes it just occurs to me that everything I've got and everything I am I didn't I wouldn't be nowhere without God I I owe God everything I I owe in my job I owe in my wife I owe in my family I owe in p peace in my home owe in my church that I go to everything that I am I owe in my Ministry every every every been an influence I ever have with anybody I owe him that because it's all due to him and nothing that I've done he said think about his grace to us of all that God has given to us all the blessing has blessed with like that song that brother eron was singing this morning think about all the good things that God has done to us and he said that's a picture of USA and we'll say 2023 he was preaching back in 1964 but 2023 is still is suffering with the same disease people that can't identify themselves yes sir they forgot his Holiness they forgot his law they forgot to be separated they forgot their morals oh if you forgot this morning this afternoon it's not morning this afternoon if you forgot let this be your reminder God is drawing you he's calling you how how is he calling by his word he's call can't can't you hear you think about that statement can have you heard from your theophany what's your theophany the theophany is your your word that onew body that we're all part of and when you hear from your theophany it's the word being preached preached from that Genesis 12627 to you that's calling you and drawing you and identifying you back to himself and when you hear the word and you receive it it quickens within you and identifies you back to that thought that God had before the foundation of the world though there's your identification when you begin to hear from here I'll say it like this let let it not stumble you you've heard from your theophany you've heard from that word that that thought that God had from before the foundation of the world and it echoed within your heart and now where once you were identified with the moral Decay and sin of the world all those lifts that Paul has all that messed upness like like Ezekiel talking about that little girl on the side of the road laying there in her blood you used to be identified with that but now you're identified with something else you've heard from you've heard from where you come from oh think about brother brother Brown told that story of I looked it up so it's not nameless his name was Abdul Ibraham iban sorri and he was a he was a slave that got sold into slavery in about 1865 but really they called him Prince because when they found out that he was really the child of a king that they called him as long as he was a slave over here they called him Prince everywhere he went and he knew how to work that cotton gin and he was so good at it that somebody came to buy him and these this is the details of that story that brother R likes to tell that that that somebody said I I want that slave and he said I you you can't have him as as good as he works as good as he knows the equipment that I have you can't he doesn't work like any other slave I'm not selling this man Abdul Ibrahim IB Sor and brother R would say one day I learned that over in the Homeland where he come from his father is the king of the whole tribe which is true this is a true story friends and though he be an alien and away from home yet he knows he's the son of a king and he conducts himself like the son of a king why cuz he was identified he knew where he come from just like a real borning in Christian a real Thoroughbred Christian knows where they come from because they've been identified with the word he said what ought it to do to a Christian that's born again a man or a woman that our father is the king of glory in heaven we should have conducted ourselves as Christian men and women we should act like it dress like it talk like it live like it now when it really strikes you what he's saying here it'll make you pick your head up and spring a little bit it'll make a preacher that's maybe downhearted preach a little bit different it'll make things it'll make things ring a little bit differently when it really strikes you what he's talking about he said one time Israel when they started wanted to have a king over it because they forgot that God was their King that that little slave Abdul knew that that he had a father over in the Homeland and he knew who his daddy was but Israel forgot that they already had a king so they wanted God they wanted a replacement for that Samuel said did I ever beg you for my food and money your money too for me to live on no you hadn't done that you never told us nothing Samuel but what come to pass and you never asked us for our money for your living but yet we want the king anyhow they forgot who their daddy was they forgot where they come from oh they forgot what their inheritance was and brother said when the world and the church joins itself together then they don't want nothing spiritual they don't want thus sayith the Lord they want what they want oh to think about that but they don't want nothing spiritual there's that not caring anymore I I don't ever want to get to a place where I don't care don't ever get to a place where you're not coming to church expecting to see something spiritual expecting to see God move don't ever get to a old cold form of place where you don't expect to see God move down the aisles and the pillar of fire on display in the hearts of lives of people oh brother R said they didn't want God's prophets no more what does that amount to they didn't want the word anymore because God's Prophet is synonymous with the word what is a prophet a prophet is somebody with a gift to get themselves totally out of the way where their their dream realm and their natural realm is so tied together where they can just dream of vision while they're awake and they can get themselves out of the way where God can express his word right through through them and speak to them so it's not when you say I don't want a prophet of God you're saying I don't want the word he said that's what this spiritual Amnesia does it makes people get to a spot to where they have no feeling on the inside of them they don't want nothing that's spiritual but you must be identified somewhere you must show that's what this is it's got to be once you go into the holy of holies you got to come back out to to put it on display to share it with other people you go into the holy of holies and you don't stay in there you put it on display now you can forgive somebody now you can love somebody you can love your spouse now it's on display James said show me thy faith show me thy faith that's why faith is at the bottom because this is the faith of God in Galatians it said I don't live by the by the I live by the faith of the Son of God faith and now now show me your works now you got faith put it on display in Matthew 5:16 he said let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven so qu the question is where does your life identify you where does your faith identify you what are you what are you that's the question that we can ask on the way home maybe laying in bed tonight as you look up at the ceiling how do I know that I'm a Christian because my identification will identify me do you do you know who you are brother BR would say you are identified either in Christ or out of Christ you're not halfway there's no such thing as a drunk Superman there's no black white bird you're either saved or you're not saved you're a saint or a sinner one way or the other and your spiritual attitude towards God word God's word identifies you exactly where you're standing so how are you identified your attitude towards the word now your attitude ain't just like nodding your head but your attitude is by Revelation you look at the word and it echoes back that you can see your own life experiences the things that you have been went through you can see the things your own Journey reflected back as you identify yourself in scripture with these stories that you're reading about and brother R would say to be American I must be identified with my nation when I am born here in this country I become a citizen and I'm identified with this nation all it is I am I must be part of let's speak think spiritual now all of it shame think about Christ on the cross now cuz that's where he's leading to all of it shame anything whatever you're identified with you're identified with the whole thing so come on now follow me to the point when I'm identified with the word I'm identified with the whole word so I can't look at the Bible and say well I believe this but I don't believe that you got to be identified with the whole thing and if you got if you got part of the word if you got the word of God just a little bit by a new birth you've got access to the whole thing brother R would say to be an American I landed on Plymouth Rock with the forefathers I had to I'm part over he's talking about identification when you read that story as an American it means something to you when you go down to Disney World and you sit there and watch the Hall of Presidents and all the presidents come out it means something to you and you see the flag waving because you're identified as an American it mean all those stories all the George Wasing the stories of how how how he lived and the the the the Liberty that he fought for and going crossing the Delaware and all those things you're identified with it and to be a true Christian brother randam said you have to be the same we don't want to forget that all that he was I'm identified with him I'm identified with him that's why in John chapter 14 it says at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I in you how do you know that how do you know that that's what I'm leading up to how do you know that 2 Corinthians 13:5 says examine yourselves whether you be in the faith examine yourself to see if you're I really identified with the scripture prove your own selves know you not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you yes except you be reprobates if you're a reprobate he's not in you but if the the word if you've heard the word and it's been born in you he's in you that Christ is in you you know when you read the Bible when you open it up at night and you're studying it out it echoes back something that was written that was thought of in God's mind before the foundation of the world so when you're reading when you're reading the word it identifies you it it's something to a real born again Christian you read these stories that might seem mundane and kind of boring to an unbeliever or a makeb Believer but to a real born again Christian it identifies you that that is where you come from that's why brother Brown could ask that question where were you God can ask that question of job where were you when the morning star sang together and the sons of God shouted their shouted for Joy am before there was a foundation of the world he said we were identified in the immortal Realms with God 10 million years before the world was ever formed I'm talking about that God thought about you that he had you in his mind and he thought about you so much that he wo you into his word so that when you read the word it's a reflection back of the thing that he thought about and that is how you are identified in the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said then what's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is that same spirit of God dwelling in the people whom he has died for and put their name yes on the Lamb's Book of Life which they were one with him in the beginning any the scripture said so did not Jesus tell them that we're with him before the foundation of the world your minds are black and and darken we all are to those things but we're not we're just not some little coincident Happening Here I want to think about that we're not just some little coincident Happening Here we are Sons and Daughters of God in the beginning of the creation of God and been dropped down here for a witness to witness the grace of God that shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost now let's meditate on that God thought about it in his mind and in his mind he wrote your name down he knew that one day you would come and be manifested and so one day you were sitting in a little Mission somewhere and you heard the word be preached which is the the projection of that word that God thought of before the foundation of the world and it grabbed a hold of your life when you believed it and it began to pull you back to that he said there was a time that you knew your mind is darken to that now there's only been one man on Earth that knew that that to knew that knew that he was before and that was Jesus he said glorify me father with the glory that I had with you before the foundation of the world he was the Incarnate God he could move back there and know what it was but our minds are blacking there why cuz we skipped the we didn't come by the word we skipped around that so we don't know but we've heard the word and that word that we've heard is that that that that word that was manifested in Genesis 12627 that's drawing us back to him that's why in Ephesians 1:4 says according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love oh to think that God before the foundation of the world knew that he would love Jacob and hate Esau cuz he knew their reaction to the word what it would be on earth and he could look ahead down through the stream of time and see that they would not love the word in Romans 9:13 it says as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated oh friends that's what I'm talking about tonight that's your identification when you read in the Bible all these stories and identifies you back with the word back with God's thought of you from before the foundation of the of the world to think that before anything would happen before anything happened we were already chosen in him because he knew he could look down through the stream of time and know how we would react he knew that Jacob would want it so God could choose it and write his name down in in in erasable ink however you want to say that to think now now listen in the Lamb's Book of Life he said now believer have you got your joy shoes on have you got your joy shoes on listen to this if you are a Christian if you are truly God's child that's not no preacher that's the Bible he said it said your names was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world oh my the same time that Christ that God sent Christ to slain he wrote your name with his that's why every every scripture that speaks of Jesus Christ also speaks of you because you go through the same Journey that Jesus went through that's how you identify when you see that then you know you recognize that you are identified with Christ because you see the same Journey there you are he said and he deceived all great small so many were church members pretended Christians he deceived all whose names were not written not in the church book but in the Lamb's Book of Life when before the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life how did he how did he write it he's going to tell us by his spoken word and sent Christ the sacrifice to buy to redeem that same group that he had wrote their names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world now it's to think that God actually spoke your name that he God knew that you would be here that you now sitting here if you're really born again that you are the word present tense that was spoken before before God spoke it and now you are that word that was spoken before and now there's your identification that you are that word that word that we read here on the the letter of the page that is God's word in letter form and when you read that and when it's preached over the pulpit and you recognize your identification that identifies you back to that word that was spoken before the world the son and the moon and the stars were ever spoken before the first Angel was spoken it identifies you back to that now I I know this is a little bit deep for being so tired and sleepy to be identified means to establish or recognize who or what something or someone is oh when you can identify yourself that you are a child a child a son or daughter of god let's see how we identify y'all can y'all hang on with me just a few more minutes thank you God bless you brother R said I was with him when he called Abraham at the age of 75 years old and his wife being 65 and told him they were going to have a baby God made a promise to Abraham now see when you read that and you read you identify your own Journey with the journey that Abraham went through that God promised him that he was going to have a child oh and you look through your own life and you you re you can read the promise on the day of Pentecost that there's a promise of the new birth and you're recogn you begin to identify your same experience with Abraham's journey and and because Abraham was a Believer and you're a Believer you're both all wrapped up in this together that's why he said he said every other Christian stood with him oh we're all part of something we're all part of one great big body oh that theophany body the word that was spoken before the foundation of the world he said I was with Joseph when he was rejected of his brothers have you ever been rejected because you've been spiritual and the rest of them was carnal maybe at your workplace people didn't like you because you were spiritual and you wanted to pray over your food or something and people started making maybe when you were in school your people would bully you because of the way you acted and you now you can identify yourself because you you've gone through the same thing you ident you can identify yourself with the life of David how people didn't think that he would amount to nothing and whatever whatever the story is maybe maybe this is the season of your life where you can be identified with job and you read that and it pops off the page because you're living it he said I was with Jacob that night when he wrestled all night with the angel you if you ever wrestled all night with the angel you know what this is talking about so you can be identified with that when you're wrestling and tears are coming down your face and you don't know you don't know how to move forward and you don't know what's around the bend but you're you're just calling out to God and wrestling over his promises you can be identified with Jacob wrestling he said I was with Moses at a burning bush and if you ever had a burning bush experience of your own you can be identified with Moses I was with Moses when all the people turned against him he said whatever Christian has been whatever Believers has been every believer now is identified with that same person and proving his word he said he proves all of his words all of his words just think of it all of his words that means he's he's talking about you he proves all of his words and you were his words word he was the word and you were part of his word and that's the reason you're sent here to confirm your place in life he said I don't think you got that see he is the word all to think you are that word that was spoken of before the foundation of the world and was sent here to confirm his word to live it out to prove to the devil he said I was with Elijah in the days of Ahab when they met had to make a Choice who they would serve God or balam I was with David when he was rejected by his own Brethren yes sir I was with Daniel in the Lion's Den you ever been in the Lion's Den and trusted in your God like Daniel did and God brought you out now you can be identified with Daniel cuz I I've lived it I've been there I've trusted in God the same way that Daniel oh to be identified with that Hall of Believers in Hebrews chapter 11 all those that just ignore the circumstances but look straight to what God promised he said I most surely was with him at Calvary I must be identified with him at Calvary I must be there to a place that where not also was I identified with him at Calvary I died with him at Calvary now if you ever died to yourself you can be identified with him at Calvary if you've ever died to your own ideas and knil to the altar of self-sacrifice you can be identified with him and he said now I'm seated with him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus with all the powers of Hell conquered through him every Christian believer was seated the same way cuz you have to be identified are you identified with the believing Christians of today brother R would say he's the same yesterday today and forever so there are believers today that you have to be identified with to be considered a real born again Christian there's been a word for every day that's been preached and to be a real born again Christian you've got to be identified with the present tense word of your day he said are you identified in his ministry Jesus's Ministry of today not of yesterday not of Martin Luther's day but of today do you find yourself that way believing it walking with it can you stand the reproach like he did see identified with him they forgotten the world has forgotten the Christian world even the denominational world that now it's just turned into clubs where they're serving Starbucks they forgotten they thought he was just a lawmaker or a prophet or a good man they forgot that he was God they forgot that he is the same yesterday today and for forever they don't understand it no more I'm I'm going to be closing in just a minute y'all don't get too worried you can get a little bit worried that's all right just don't get too worried he said I was identified with Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost in Acts the 2 chapter I heard what he said I believe what he said I obeyed what he said oh if you can when you read that story and identify oh if you've been there you can be identified with it let me let me skip through some of this he said I like a genuine Thor bread that's real gentle that know where he come from and we know where he come from because we come from the word we've been born of the spirit when you look into the Bible and you hear you hear the message being played on your tape at home or in the car or you hear the gospel preach it identifies you and tells you where you come from author bread has got pedigree papers to show where he come from and we've got the scripture the revelation of Jesus Christ to show where we come from where did you come from in Luke chapter 10 Jesus told his disciples he said behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions they got they had power to cast out devils and do great Miracles and signs and wonders but he said now don't be happy about that that's wonderful but he said notwithstanding in this Rejoice that Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written down in heaven and that's where the title of this sermon comes from are you on God's list cuz God had a list in heaven of names that he spoke before the foundation of the world and if you're on that list if your name is on that list you know it's on that list when you're identified with the word when you hear the word preached and something Echoes back to identify with it it gives you confidence oh that's that's what the Seven Seals are for to give us confidence that God has fully redeemed us that we're going to take a body change to show us where we come from in Hebrews chapter 7 he said it's God blessed be the name of the Lord It's God that worketh he said if Jesus was slain before the foundation of the world it taken 4,000 years before it actually happened but when God spoke it back here every word of God is steadfast it's immutable it's imparable that's a new word word to me impart it cannot fail and when God slay the sun before the foundation of the world he was just as much slain then as he was at Calvary it's a finished product When God says so and remember when the lamb was slain your salvation was included in the sacrifice because the Bible said that your name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world how do I know how do I know my name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life because you're acting it out now whether or not your name was written was determined by your reaction now present tense what's happening right now but to think that God had a place reserved for you because he knew your reaction right now how it would be he knew when it was offered to you if you would respond or not he said the message Perfection he said notice not only Christ was slain to take away sin but your name was written in the L's Book of Life God wrote your name associated with his before the foundation of the world now Satan make them get scared now get them to doubt that before the world ever began God called your name you Christians and wrote it in the Lamb's Book of Life before the world ever started sayith the Bible he said in the message Jehovah Gyra I'll be closing in just a moment he said those who he forew he called those who he called he justified those who he has Justified he has already glorified what are you scared about that's right and the Antichrist in the last days according to Revelations deceived all that dwelt upon the face of the Earth whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world that's when your name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life when the lamb was slain God spoke the word it was in his thinking in his thought he spoke the word and everything happened just at that time this is just God's seed materializing that's all his words coming down now if you're conf confused about the seed there's your answer this is just God's seed materializing that's all his words coming down now when the light of God flashes across that quickly that seed recognize it so as the musicians come we'll answer ask this question where were you where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy where were you can you be identified with the scripture can you be identified with that word that was spoken before the foundation of the world brother Ram told maybe as a musician just kind of play something softly that brother R told that story of that French soldier soldier that got so shocked just like people as they go from different churches and hear false Doctrine they begin to wonder what's true and what's not this Soldier was so shocked that they were going to put him in in an insane asylum and they loaded him up on a train and they stopped somewhere just to get a break and and one of the guards followed them as that Soldier began to walk and and he turned at this stop and he turned at the next stop and he just kept walking and walking until finally he walked up to this door and an old man came out and he said my son I knew that you were going to come home he had somehow wound up at his daddy's doorstep and he recognized all of a sudden he remembered where he come from you see that's what the word that's what the word of God that's the effect that the word of God has in our life it causes us to remember where we come from that God thought about you before the foundation of the world he had a portion of himself reserved for you in this hour and when you hear the word and recognize it it identifies you back with that just like that French soldier was identified back oh he said oh that's my daddy he realized that's my daddy that's where I come from and his eyes were open and he began to realize he recogn he was identified with his home and where where he was oh friend if you're not identified with the word why don't you take this opportunity to yield yourself yourself to give yourself to the Lord I want you to stand let's stand to our [Music] feet as we ask this question are you are you on God's list can we can we bow our heads just a moment let's bow our heads this morning if you want to be on God's list once you raise your hand lift up your hand to the Lord Lord Jesus you've seen all these hands Lord Jesus all these hands Raised To You Lord God I'm trusting and believing Lord God that you're still calling Lord Jesus Lord you're still calling and how are you calling you're drawing by Your Word Lord Jesus this still preach over a pit Lord God and I believe that it still has the same effect as it had thousands has had for thousands of years Lord Jesus Lord the scripture says because you are sent Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father I think God that before before the worlds were created you knew he was going to be a son and you had it prepared and because of that he sent forth his Spirit into our hearts God you've given us the baptism of the Holy Ghost to identify us back with that word that was preached that was spoken of before the foundation of the world Lord Jesus we just ask Lord your blessing upon this service now Lord Jesus your blessing upon the people
