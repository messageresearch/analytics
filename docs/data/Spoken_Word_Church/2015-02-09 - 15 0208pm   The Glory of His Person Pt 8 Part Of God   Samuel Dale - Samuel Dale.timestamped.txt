[19:07] about a five minute testimony i just
[19:09] want to
[19:10] share with you
[19:12] i can't think of a better time
[19:15] for a test for without a test you cannot
[19:17] have a testimony than the study of the
[19:19] stature of the perfect man
[19:23] and i want to ask you a question and
[19:24] just think about this i'm going to
[19:27] be kind of broad but i'm going to bring
[19:28] very simple
[19:30] where were you setting when you were 15
[19:31] years old
[19:35] just think about this
[19:37] and think about a journey
[19:40] 15 years old
[19:42] my father
[19:44] had built a company
[19:45] a plant from the ground up he'd lost his
[19:47] job
[19:49] he went
[19:50] out about a million and a half dollars
[19:54] built a plant
[19:57] and
[19:59] made
[20:01] the 1967
[20:03] air conditioner pulley for ford motor
[20:05] company
[20:08] and that went on for a couple years
[20:10] until the guy that loaned him the money
[20:12] died in an airplane crash
[20:14] it devastated my father
[20:18] i grew up two cadillacs in a garage a
[20:21] jaguar
[20:22] i mean life has always been good i've
[20:24] always been blessed but that was on the
[20:26] material side before i ever heard the
[20:28] word
[20:28] amen
[20:30] so i've been at the highest high and
[20:32] i've been at the lowest
[20:33] low
[20:35] i've been in a place at 18 years old
[20:37] when our family split
[20:40] my father said leave
[20:42] my mother my brother and my sister
[20:45] walked out of a house down a highway
[20:47] no place to lay our head
[20:53] but you know
[20:55] that was my journey
[20:59] built some character
[21:05] but i just want to share with you a
[21:07] couple things that's happened you know
[21:08] as most of you might know i lost my job
[21:10] last friday
[21:12] because i i really believe it's because
[21:14] for what i stood for what i believed in
[21:19] i'd been asked to terminate four people
[21:22] and
[21:23] i couldn't justify it
[21:25] so time went on
[21:29] so every dog has his day as they say
[21:33] so i just turn around and walk away but
[21:34] i've never been without a job more than
[21:36] a weekend
[21:38] that that happened on friday
[21:41] i was getting calls monday morning
[21:44] people shocked that i lost my job
[21:47] they were no better more shocked than i
[21:49] was trust me
[21:51] have you ever been hit in the face with
[21:52] a shovel you could just imagine what it
[21:54] feels like when you're totally
[21:56] unexpected when a man now listen man's
[21:59] word comes to you
[22:02] every day for six years or once a week
[22:05] at least and says you're never gonna
[22:06] leave me are you
[22:08] you're never gonna retire you'll have a
[22:10] job here as long as you want
[22:13] and you put faith in what that man tells
[22:15] you
[22:16] there's a lot of employees listening in
[22:18] today
[22:19] i invited them to hear the word and how
[22:22] the lord has worked in their lives and
[22:24] they never recognized what he was doing
[22:29] maybe they're watching maybe they're not
[22:32] but my boss would call me and he'd say i
[22:35] need you to pray for me
[22:37] in situations and i would pray for him
[22:40] and things would happen
[22:42] there's a young man out there that i
[22:43] believe has taken my place last i heard
[22:46] last night
[22:48] that was a citizen or tried to become a
[22:51] citizen he was from another country
[22:54] he had a little problem in his
[22:55] background as a young man
[22:57] before he really became at the age of
[23:00] 18 years old
[23:03] it stopped him from becoming a citizen
[23:06] they came to me
[23:08] asked me to pray
[23:15] i wrote letters to the governor
[23:17] because i know a lot of people
[23:19] throughout the state and through our
[23:20] home school stance
[23:22] what we went through and met a lot of
[23:24] people
[23:26] well you know this problem this young
[23:28] man had in his background mysteriously
[23:30] went away
[23:32] now it's not mysterious how it went away
[23:34] i know how it went away
[23:38] okay
[23:39] there was an engineer that came to me
[23:41] and he asked me
[23:42] i said something in the email and i
[23:44] prayed and mentioned something he kind
[23:46] of made light of it laughed about
[23:48] it three weeks later his house burned
[23:54] but he they restored it and he's back in
[23:56] it
[23:58] i'm just trying to tell you some things
[23:59] that happen on the job
[24:01] and funny thing about this job that i
[24:03] just have left
[24:05] i was working for a gentleman i helped
[24:07] him start a company and he's actually
[24:08] building a new plant right now
[24:10] but he was uh i was standing there been
[24:12] there five years with him just working
[24:14] my own business
[24:16] and being a good employee and one day i
[24:18] asked the lord i said lord
[24:19] if it be you will i change jobs give me
[24:21] a sign
[24:22] 30 minutes i haven't looked for a job in
[24:24] five years
[24:25] 30 minutes my phone rings it takes me to
[24:28] this job that i just left
[24:32] so
[24:33] with that said
[24:34] faith
[24:37] and the study of the statute perfect man
[24:39] is what's made me strong
[24:41] amen
[24:43] it's funny and we're studying if you
[24:45] have a book a extra book about what is
[24:47] the holy spirit was the holy spirit
[24:49] given for we should bring it to us to
[24:51] use in our sunday school class
[24:53] because the students and i and kids were
[24:56] studying beginning that study of what is
[24:58] the holy spirit
[25:00] and i often tell him i said you watch
[25:02] what happens downstairs here
[25:04] and when you go upstairs and tell me if
[25:06] you don't see the holy spirit working
[25:08] but today
[25:12] i didn't prepare as well as i should
[25:13] have
[25:14] but the lord laid on my heart to read
[25:16] john 1.
[25:18] we talked about john 1 all the way
[25:20] through it
[25:22] and what happened
[25:24] we come up here
[25:25] brother dale reads
[25:26] it josiah looks at me and he goes
[25:31] because i tell him i said you watch
[25:32] where the holy spirit's working
[25:34] amen
[25:36] okay
[25:38] and then just couple weeks ago i told
[25:40] jan i said you know i wish i had some
[25:42] way that i could be with you all the
[25:43] time
[25:45] well i had a boss tell me one time he
[25:47] said be careful for what you wish for
[25:50] you might get it so they might think
[25:53] that they terminated me but i believe or
[25:55] we separate whatever but i just believe
[25:57] that the lord's worked in a lot a way
[26:00] for me to be around how and audrey and
[26:01] help them at the time of need of things
[26:04] going on we've got so much things to do
[26:06] he's prepared us a way to sit back i sat
[26:10] down and i was wanting somebody to read
[26:11] the chapter isaiah 2 before i started my
[26:14] testimony this morning because of what
[26:15] talked about the silver and the gold and
[26:17] all the things in it but
[26:19] just read that when you leave here
[26:21] sometime and just see
[26:22] how he just mysteriously laid that on
[26:24] the heart when i sit down this morning
[26:25] open my bible
[26:28] but i've laid hands on equipment i've
[26:30] laid hands on
[26:33] stuff at work and it's just amazing the
[26:36] problems went away and things went to
[26:37] running
[26:38] when i started with that company six
[26:40] years ago they hadn't made a profit in
[26:42] five years
[26:44] and tell you how the lord's blessed what
[26:46] we did
[26:47] and it took every one of us it's not
[26:48] what i did but it's what he did
[26:50] and they need to realize that's what he
[26:52] did because
[26:53] another reason why i've been probably
[26:55] parted with a company is they have to
[26:58] the plan business plan has changed where
[27:00] they have to recover before anything
[27:03] happens they have to recover
[27:05] forty thousand dollar negative to the
[27:07] month
[27:08] then your expenses start i had a budget
[27:10] about forty thousand dollars a month so
[27:12] they have to recover that much money
[27:14] every month just to make their profit
[27:16] line
[27:18] last two three four five years they
[27:20] would come to me and say there's sixty
[27:22] thousand dollars you need to spend it
[27:23] this month there's fifty thousand
[27:25] dollars extra you need to spend it this
[27:26] month
[27:28] today they've gotta
[27:30] recover a hundred and forty thousand
[27:31] dollars starting january 1
[27:34] to even get back to where they were at
[27:37] so my work was finished there
[27:39] i shared with the lord they called me a
[27:41] man of the cloth a preacher all that i
[27:43] never walked around
[27:45] talking about the lord unless somebody
[27:47] asked me
[27:49] right i never forced it on them
[27:53] and that's what i'm trying to tell my
[27:54] children in sunday school just
[27:58] take on the son of man ministry make the
[28:00] word come alive in the flesh
[28:02] that's what the message is
[28:05] amen
[28:08] but all of this
[28:09] is about building character
[28:12] amen
[28:14] i stand proud with a clear conscience
[28:17] that i served
[28:19] and owe nothing
[28:21] and i thank you all for your prayers and
[28:23] continue to pray for me amen
[28:38] let's stand together somebody left
[28:40] some glasses in their keys downstairs
[28:43] laying on the table
[28:46] uh okay here it should take them back
[28:50] they just somebody walked by and found
[28:51] them laying there and didn't want to
[28:52] leave them out in the open
[28:54] you know
[28:55] and all but
[28:57] you know you follow the lord he'll take
[28:58] care of you
[29:00] sister johnny i used to talk to her a
[29:02] lot on the telephone when she was up in
[29:03] new york
[29:05] and uh
[29:06] it took a long time for it to get
[29:08] through to her
[29:10] what was going on because they would get
[29:13] ready to shut down certain things of
[29:15] what she was doing and
[29:17] you know just right before they'd shut
[29:19] it down they'd move her out of that
[29:21] department into another
[29:23] and she'd come tell me she said
[29:25] they just moved me out
[29:28] well three months later they just moved
[29:30] me out one day i said do you realize
[29:32] what's taking place
[29:35] he said
[29:36] well i believe the lord lead me and you
[29:38] know she wound up being up under
[29:40] and i even knew the
[29:42] the lady that was the ceo or whatever
[29:45] don lowe she
[29:47] yeah she was you know right up under her
[29:50] and then they finally shut down
[29:52] everything
[29:53] you know and she gets to retire
[29:56] well sometimes you know the lord's
[29:58] working things out
[30:00] so just go along with it and wait to see
[30:03] what he's doing he may work it out in
[30:05] the right way but the boyd said he
[30:07] doesn't receive
[30:09] three phone calls about a job
[30:12] well lord take care of it
[30:14] he always has he's he's never left it
[30:17] you know where that he doesn't lead all
[30:19] right
[30:20] think of these things amen
[30:23] if you'd like turn in your scriptures
[30:24] turn where we'll read in revelations 1
[30:28] and then we'll go to philippians
[30:32] 2.
[30:34] try to continue our thought on from this
[30:36] morning
[30:38] so we'll
[30:39] it i thought it was a good time maybe to
[30:41] do a little background
[30:43] catch up to where we're at and just
[30:44] preach a little bit you know and then we
[30:47] can move on all right
[30:49] so remember these we were wading them on
[30:50] the way in home this afternoon
[30:52] and pray that the lord would bless and
[30:54] take care
[30:56] heavenly father we thank you for
[30:58] everything we love you and we carry
[31:00] lord for what you
[31:02] are desiring to do among us we care very
[31:04] heavily about it because we want to do
[31:06] that
[31:07] and we know and realize that there's
[31:08] none of us worth anything so we just
[31:11] leave it all aside and say thank you
[31:13] lord you're taking care of it not you
[31:15] always will
[31:17] and we believe you these are just little
[31:19] tests and trials down here in life
[31:22] that we
[31:23] lord have to put up with but they're
[31:25] great trials for a day coming when
[31:27] things maybe get worse and
[31:29] and all like that but we don't look
[31:31] forward to those things but we do know
[31:33] that they will be coming because it has
[31:35] been said
[31:37] and so let it be lord but yet give us
[31:39] grace
[31:40] when it comes to those times and the
[31:43] hour
[31:44] that is needed
[31:45] we just ask you now to open our eyes to
[31:47] the word that we're trying to speak
[31:49] about
[31:51] and father forgive me when i'm
[31:53] i try to get so hard to try to get
[31:55] people to believe till i know sometimes
[31:57] i turn people off and they're thinking
[32:01] but i've just tried and you you know
[32:03] that
[32:05] and father we just pray that you'd bless
[32:07] and guide each one be awaiting them on
[32:08] the way home
[32:09] and father this afternoon him
[32:11] ministering
[32:12] be with him and lord bless and god each
[32:14] and every one of us remember the sick
[32:16] remember brother gary there lord we know
[32:18] that his foot's busted open and
[32:21] a lot of problems with it and we pray
[32:23] that you would just reach down and touch
[32:25] him
[32:26] and deliver him from that because we
[32:28] believe you have your way now as we read
[32:30] your words you come on the scene to
[32:32] speak to our hearts
[32:33] in jesus name
[32:35] amen
[32:41] verse 10 revelation 1 i was in the
[32:43] spirit on the lord's day and heard
[32:45] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[32:47] saying i am alpha and omega
[32:50] the first and the lies and what thou
[32:51] seest write in a book and send it unto
[32:54] the seven churches which are in asia
[32:56] unto ephesus and under smyrna and unto
[32:59] pergamos and under titara and under
[33:02] sardis and under philadelphia and under
[33:05] lady osea and i turned to see the voices
[33:07] spake with me and being turned i saw
[33:09] seven golden candlesticks and one in the
[33:11] midst of the seven candlesticks
[33:14] and in the midst of the seven
[33:15] candlestick one like unto the son of man
[33:17] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[33:20] and gird about the paps with a golden
[33:23] girdle all right let's go over to
[33:26] philippians
[33:27] to try to pick up our thought from this
[33:29] morning
[33:30] and maybe move on into
[33:33] some things
[33:36] verse 5 let this mind be in you
[33:41] which was also in christ jesus
[33:46] who being now that's not your brain
[33:48] that's not your brain mind
[33:51] that is the holy spirit
[33:54] to dwell in your heart
[33:56] to give you
[33:58] understanding
[33:59] all right
[34:00] who being in the form of god
[34:04] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[34:06] god
[34:07] but made himself of no reputation
[34:09] and took upon him the form of a servant
[34:11] was made in the likeness of men
[34:14] and been found in fashion
[34:16] as a man he humbled himself and became
[34:18] obedient unto death even the death of
[34:22] the cross you may be seated
[34:24] the lord add his blessing to the
[34:26] reading of the word
[34:29] now
[34:31] to try to move pretty fast through
[34:34] our background point
[34:37] remember that we have been talking about
[34:40] the condescending of god
[34:44] we'll give a couple of quotes in a
[34:45] minute i hope you list looked on your
[34:47] computer
[34:48] and just write in condescend or
[34:50] condescending you'll find that brother
[34:52] branham covered a lot on that
[34:54] and you think that i'm trying to drag
[34:56] this thing out i'm trying my best to
[34:58] shorten it
[35:00] and even like this afternoon i want to
[35:02] pack three messages into one
[35:05] okay so if i take a few extra minutes
[35:07] forgive me
[35:09] and just bear with me because i want to
[35:11] talk about
[35:12] you know uh
[35:15] how that god
[35:18] can come down
[35:20] and reveal himself
[35:24] to a mortal being
[35:27] now that's that's uh
[35:29] that's something isn't it amen and i
[35:31] believe that
[35:32] and we've been talking about you know
[35:34] that
[35:35] and go ahead brother if you will pull up
[35:37] the uh
[35:38] the little drawing
[35:40] with the attributes written on it
[35:43] and we've been talking about that
[35:46] how that brother branham would say in
[35:47] the beginning but before the eternal
[35:50] and then he say in the beginning was the
[35:51] word and when time began it was word
[35:55] but before it was word
[35:57] it was attribute or thought
[36:00] all right
[36:01] then we made a little drawing just
[36:03] something happy to understand and we
[36:05] place the word eternal in the middle and
[36:07] we back up onto this side to say before
[36:11] the eternal
[36:12] which is just an expression
[36:14] a way of saying that you say yeah but
[36:16] there's nothing before well that's where
[36:18] you're not listening
[36:20] you you know you need to go back and
[36:21] listen to the other day when i was
[36:23] trying my best to express that we have
[36:27] really made it something by saying
[36:29] eternal
[36:31] you know because that
[36:32] put it into a position that has no
[36:35] beginning or no ending how can you bring
[36:38] a word that would would say anything
[36:41] that is the best word that could be
[36:43] thought of
[36:44] so then it's placed there as eternal
[36:47] all right
[36:49] but back before that eternal part could
[36:51] be is to me
[36:52] to me the prophet is trying to explain
[36:56] how that way back in eternities back
[36:59] here in eternities you remember on
[37:02] christ the mystery of god revealed he
[37:04] said let's go in the back part of god's
[37:06] mind see keep on going on back
[37:09] you know going this way and
[37:12] in doing it we can see those things
[37:15] as they're there
[37:17] all right
[37:18] and then we we know for surety
[37:21] that
[37:22] the word creation
[37:25] in god's terminologies doesn't deal with
[37:27] creation like we do because the prophet
[37:30] went on one day to say
[37:32] that the first creation was god himself
[37:36] well that just
[37:37] your mind goes like that because there's
[37:39] no way to comprehend
[37:41] that it has to be revealed
[37:44] and by thinking about it then
[37:46] it's really just him in his ways of
[37:49] trying to express it
[37:52] to where it would give us some idea
[37:55] or a thought you know that we could be
[37:57] able to
[37:58] to comprehend
[38:00] that there was a time that there was
[38:03] nothing as far as we think
[38:05] but now watch what i'm saying now that's
[38:07] a direct quote right a time there was
[38:09] nothing but remember god was there
[38:13] so he's not meaning there was a time
[38:14] there was no god
[38:17] that could be a thought as well as
[38:18] anything else if you're just going to
[38:20] deal with it on that way
[38:21] you know
[38:23] there was a time that there was
[38:25] nothing like we have here existences and
[38:29] different things but there was never a
[38:31] time that there wasn't god
[38:34] if it is you had him beginning
[38:37] you know
[38:38] well if you have him beginning then he's
[38:40] just like us
[38:42] and who created who that's what i've
[38:44] always said about the the trinity people
[38:46] you know who created who did the father
[38:48] create the son and the son create the
[38:50] holy ghost and
[38:51] you know that's
[38:53] that's beyond all comprehension of the
[38:56] human mind
[38:58] but we try to do it all right
[39:02] but now remember we talked about
[39:04] each attribute
[39:07] and looking at those attributes brother
[39:09] brown said that so in his great mind
[39:12] he wanted these attributes to be
[39:14] expressed in him was love in him was to
[39:18] be father in him was to be son and him
[39:20] was to be savior in him was to be healer
[39:23] and these attributes that we see already
[39:26] express
[39:27] they were in him
[39:29] i remember this morning i said we look
[39:31] at it as we think
[39:33] that
[39:34] what it is
[39:35] there's just a possibility
[39:38] for something to be able to go over that
[39:39] away
[39:41] no
[39:42] they were already there
[39:44] he said but but but there was nothing
[39:45] lost
[39:50] let me ask you a simple question
[39:54] did being lost make him a savior
[40:02] now being lost is an attribute upon
[40:05] earth
[40:07] it didn't make him a savior it made him
[40:10] display
[40:13] the point of a savior
[40:15] because if not then somewhere he had to
[40:18] develop the savior point
[40:22] right
[40:23] and remember what i said this morning
[40:24] then we think that he just had these
[40:26] abilities
[40:27] but there was nothing there well all of
[40:29] the quotes from the prophetess we'll
[40:31] read will say that they were already
[40:33] there
[40:34] all right now i wish you would look at
[40:36] that drawing for one time
[40:41] and then you can see what we're trying
[40:43] to talk about and was this morning
[40:45] about and we'll be spending a lot this
[40:47] afternoon about
[40:49] god not changing and but only thing he
[40:52] changes changes his form
[40:54] and then trying to tie attributes with
[40:56] him and with it and going into part of
[41:00] god
[41:01] and uh
[41:03] look at the drawing
[41:06] and think
[41:08] now he didn't develop
[41:10] father
[41:12] i mean he he didn't become father he
[41:15] brought it into being
[41:16] right
[41:18] so it already was father
[41:20] now look at each one of those
[41:22] individually
[41:25] is
[41:29] that a manifestation of god
[41:33] father
[41:34] all right
[41:35] his son a manifestation of god
[41:39] is logos
[41:41] speech a manifestation of god is savior
[41:44] a manifestation of god
[41:48] is healer theophany christ
[41:51] is the word a manifestation of god
[41:54] then you realize that you can't take out
[41:56] any one of those
[41:59] because you're taking away
[42:02] from god
[42:03] but do you realize each one of them is
[42:05] god in another form
[42:09] right
[42:12] now that should become simple
[42:15] it's god in another form but if you take
[42:17] out one of them what have you got
[42:20] you're taking away from his
[42:22] form
[42:24] look at that as each one a form of god
[42:27] then you can look at father son and holy
[42:29] ghost the prophet would say the three
[42:31] attributes of god is father son and holy
[42:33] god take away one of those any one of
[42:35] them and you don't have the full
[42:37] truth do you
[42:41] see if you do away with any form of god
[42:44] anywhere here or there after or before
[42:46] whatever
[42:48] if you do away with any form of god
[42:50] you've really you've gone into worse
[42:53] than trinitarianism or
[42:55] or the oneness
[42:56] concept you've gone into what the
[42:58] scripture says that if you take away
[43:00] what did he say
[43:02] he'd take away you
[43:05] see just look at it just simply look at
[43:07] it and think about it
[43:10] each one of those is a form of god
[43:14] you say well how do you know because
[43:15] they have come over
[43:17] to hear and been displayed down through
[43:20] time
[43:22] right
[43:23] and that's the point i want you to get
[43:25] is looking at it as we know the prophet
[43:28] would give the words you know of
[43:29] immorphy
[43:31] god changing his form
[43:35] all right
[43:37] see then if once he does away with one
[43:39] four in other words move from one form
[43:40] to the other he doesn't do away with
[43:42] that form
[43:45] it wouldn't matter if i lived to be 150
[43:47] years old i wouldn't do away with the
[43:49] fact of being
[43:52] husband father
[43:55] grandfather
[43:57] great grandfather
[43:59] you keep adding instead of doing away
[44:04] you know unfolding
[44:06] as things come into being but now watch
[44:08] that just take that thought
[44:14] and think about it see we we want to get
[44:16] to a point where i just can't quite
[44:18] understand
[44:20] but why not do as he said they're from
[44:22] christ the mystery and all these great
[44:24] attributes that we see already expressed
[44:28] they were in god
[44:32] all right
[44:33] so we never gained an attribute
[44:36] investment he says
[44:40] were the great attributes of god
[44:43] where he was before he was for he even
[44:47] was god
[44:48] before there was god is an object of
[44:51] worship
[44:52] before he even become that
[44:55] he was still god he is the eternal and
[44:58] these attributes was in him
[45:02] and they just display themselves
[45:07] that was in him
[45:09] now i want to drive that hard because
[45:12] if you can't see that those attributes
[45:14] within him
[45:15] then you can't follow anything of coming
[45:18] on over and displaying those attributes
[45:20] because you're going to be adding taken
[45:22] away et cetera and it will not work
[45:26] god's provided approach
[45:30] i'm just quoting these to where we'll
[45:31] get to it and then we'll start reading
[45:32] in a minute
[45:34] now these attributes was in him
[45:37] so that may so that made it display
[45:41] something to worship the first thing he
[45:44] made was angelic beings
[45:47] attributes
[45:48] he had attributes to be sung at
[45:51] attributes to be
[45:53] savior
[45:54] in him was the attributes of healer
[45:57] attributes to be god
[46:00] see that's back before
[46:02] he ever brings anything into being
[46:06] that would be a worship part
[46:08] or would be healing that would do you
[46:11] can't make an eternal healing i mean an
[46:13] eternal
[46:14] sickness
[46:16] all right so we know there was a time
[46:18] sickness started
[46:21] but there was never a time that god
[46:23] started
[46:25] it's only the basis that you're dealing
[46:27] with he's made angelic beings and they
[46:30] worship him now we've come up into the
[46:32] understanding of the word god
[46:34] but he always was god
[46:37] well i can't understand that well that's
[46:39] what i say you need to pray
[46:43] because i can't explain it
[46:45] and if your prophet and me reading it to
[46:47] you
[46:49] from what he says
[46:52] that can't explain it either
[46:54] it takes a revelation
[46:57] right
[46:59] i can do the best i can of simplifying
[47:01] it
[47:02] the prophet done the best i believe he
[47:04] could do of simplifying it
[47:08] but yet our minds are still
[47:11] connected back to that
[47:14] link of seeing things
[47:17] but remember how i tried to explain it
[47:20] the
[47:23] this attribute of father
[47:25] well you know one day he was displayed
[47:30] the attribute of son one day was
[47:32] displayed
[47:35] because that's the condescending of god
[47:38] to bring it to where we can see those
[47:40] things
[47:42] all right
[47:43] and see we know there couldn't be a
[47:46] uh you know which came first
[47:50] brother
[47:50] luis is getting him our wednesday about
[47:52] it and which one came first the chicken
[47:55] or the egg
[47:56] and
[47:57] the
[47:58] you know
[47:58] we believe the chicken came first
[48:00] because it was created he didn't create
[48:01] eggs and let them hatch
[48:04] all right
[48:05] well see which came first sickness or
[48:08] savior
[48:10] did he become a savior because of a
[48:12] sickness
[48:14] no
[48:16] he was a savior so thereby we know
[48:20] before the world now i hope you're
[48:22] listening to what i'm trying to drive
[48:25] that before the world
[48:28] he knew what he's going to do
[48:31] you agree with that
[48:33] he knew he was going to create man
[48:36] he knew if he created man
[48:39] he would go wrong do you need those
[48:41] quotes they are there in the prophet's
[48:43] message so you ought to know it
[48:46] but which came first sickness
[48:49] or healer
[48:51] the healer was already there or the
[48:53] sickness wouldn't have come
[48:55] right see we we want to make it the
[48:57] sickness would come then he becomes a
[48:58] healer
[49:00] you've made him change
[49:03] and see you're not listening to the
[49:06] thought because of what i said here
[49:09] each one of those could be isolated by
[49:11] itself
[49:13] and make him a
[49:14] father it could be isolated by a son
[49:19] but each one of those is god made
[49:22] manifest
[49:26] now what do we get to it a while in the
[49:27] message and we'll be reading where
[49:29] brother branham said that he didn't send
[49:31] a son
[49:36] he said he came himself
[49:39] well all right let's start off right
[49:44] let's start off right he came himself
[49:49] see like i said who could talk like a
[49:51] prophet
[49:53] he said now our english word
[49:57] i can't remember what it is in our body
[49:59] house like vomit
[50:00] and time
[50:02] he said but that's not right with god
[50:05] he said but a part of god went out
[50:11] part of god
[50:16] you said that ain't even sensible
[50:22] i agree with you
[50:24] but it's truth
[50:27] he said not an arm went off
[50:30] right
[50:32] now one of these days you're going to be
[50:34] able to understand and catch it then
[50:37] you'll see
[50:38] that why i believe
[50:41] when he comes here all god was poured
[50:44] into christ
[50:47] now i'm going to say it so you go ahead
[50:48] and
[50:49] laugh and differ with it that's a part
[50:52] of god
[50:56] that's right
[50:58] but let's go on over
[51:00] and all christ was he poured into the
[51:02] church
[51:04] that's a part of god
[51:09] see that requires thinking
[51:12] it requires revelation
[51:15] it requires us to get rid of our
[51:16] mentalities of what we think is right
[51:19] and believe god's word
[51:22] well i don't understand you really
[51:24] confused me i didn't confuse you
[51:27] i just
[51:28] made known you're confusing
[51:32] you get mad at me paul said if i become
[51:34] your image because i tell you the truth
[51:38] all right
[51:39] see then we say what the prophet said
[51:41] and then everybody why don't you say
[51:43] what the prophet said well i want to
[51:45] hear you
[51:46] women are who
[51:49] wade finishes this series i'll even give
[51:51] you your dear sisters a week or two to
[51:54] explain one god
[51:56] some other way than what i've tried my
[51:59] best for 50 years to express to you
[52:04] but remember i'm going to do you like
[52:07] a man at work one time
[52:10] he differed with me about the god head
[52:12] and i said okay now what i'm going to do
[52:14] i'm going to stand here and listen to
[52:16] you and i want you to start explaining
[52:18] your great revelation
[52:22] i said but now remember you've been
[52:24] fussing with me
[52:27] you know everything i've said no that
[52:28] ain't right no it's got to be just what
[52:30] i said you've been doing that with me so
[52:32] now for a minute i'm going to change the
[52:34] story around a little bit and i want you
[52:36] to start explaining your great
[52:38] revelation but i said when you come to a
[52:40] point that you're off the word i'm going
[52:42] to raise my hand and say hold it you're
[52:44] out of the word
[52:46] i said you agree with me he said yeah he
[52:48] said two words i raised my hand
[52:52] that's no joke
[52:55] because he already went off the word
[52:59] but you see then to me then see i'm
[53:01] called a smart aleck
[53:04] on intellect because of doing that
[53:07] well if it's
[53:10] i thought god could work in any way he
[53:11] wanted to
[53:13] i thought he could use a dumb donkey to
[53:14] bring the truth
[53:17] all right it don't give you no right to
[53:19] reject it don't matter who it's brought
[53:20] by
[53:22] you're dealing with god you're not
[53:23] dealing with with man
[53:26] but do you understand what i'm getting
[53:27] at
[53:30] when he displayed himself
[53:34] as father
[53:35] that was an attribute or form of god
[53:41] all right now each one of these is god
[53:46] that can be made manifest
[53:49] right
[53:50] simple
[53:53] does it make that many gods
[53:57] no it makes a god it can be made
[53:59] manifest
[54:01] so remember we're not looking at a first
[54:03] person sending a second person that
[54:05] needed a third person to get it to you
[54:09] brother branham say it he's not even do
[54:12] you want this quote i may have it in
[54:14] here but it's fine
[54:15] he said he's not even the first person
[54:18] you remember that
[54:19] he said he is the person
[54:23] because if you made him the first person
[54:25] that would mean his ability to be two or
[54:27] more persons
[54:28] but when he's the only person
[54:32] there's no ability to change anything
[54:35] brother branham was to me you you called
[54:37] me a smart aleck and hard but you
[54:40] listened to him i i never got around to
[54:42] saying that so that doctrine y'all got
[54:44] it so
[54:45] shallow that you you know
[54:48] get off a shot of a chicken and starve
[54:50] to death
[54:52] you know but everybody said i'm running
[54:54] around love me
[54:56] yeah
[54:57] okay he did
[54:58] or he wouldn't have said it that way
[55:00] all right but do you understand now
[55:04] these attributes was in him
[55:07] before anything developed
[55:12] of any form
[55:13] they were in him
[55:16] now then
[55:18] maybe you'll realize one of these days
[55:20] why i believe god is real
[55:23] and why did i believe that he's a being
[55:25] and that's what i've been hammering
[55:26] about
[55:29] i don't believe it before the world back
[55:31] over here in the eternities that he was
[55:34] just a glob of iron floating around
[55:36] because there was no error
[55:37] that's what your prophet said now go
[55:39] ahead and argue
[55:40] he said before
[55:42] anything adams are molecules
[55:48] right
[55:50] you know it might have been a beautiful
[55:51] place
[55:53] that he lived in
[55:58] yeah but you're just making him too real
[56:01] i wish i could drive it so hard to let
[56:03] you to see how real he is
[56:06] anything you think is real remember he
[56:08] created it
[56:10] and how can the thing that created it
[56:13] be lower than a what is created
[56:21] you know that this is a plain language
[56:23] he could set back before the world
[56:27] before anything
[56:31] and he could think about all of the
[56:33] things that was going to relate to
[56:34] father
[56:39] he could think about all the things he
[56:40] was going to relate to son
[56:44] he could think of all of the things that
[56:45] relate to healer
[56:47] savior
[56:49] the theophany the christ the logos that
[56:51] we think are beautiful words that we
[56:53] really think makes us something because
[56:54] we say them
[57:01] what do you think about before this
[57:03] world ever got started in any form
[57:09] i remember i all and i believe it that's
[57:12] more real than what this is yes
[57:18] do you mean brother dale do you think
[57:19] that that back there that god could have
[57:21] been up there doing that now i'm not
[57:23] exactly with the thor
[57:25] ideas
[57:27] okay your kids would understand more
[57:28] than adults maybe but you know they say
[57:30] thunder is is thor or zeus one throwing
[57:33] rolling balls through the heavens and
[57:35] they're running into the clouds and
[57:37] bloom bloom you know
[57:40] no not exactly that way
[57:44] i just believe he was real
[57:47] you know what i believe he's real
[57:48] because i believe he's real now
[57:51] whatever remember that comes over here
[57:54] had to be over here
[57:57] well do you believe that there could
[57:58] have been another world before this
[57:59] world no
[58:02] glad you thought of that
[58:04] no i don't
[58:07] because when we use the word
[58:09] word world
[58:10] we look at this form of what we have
[58:16] right
[58:17] when the word world means cosmos or
[58:20] world order
[58:26] why do you think they would come up with
[58:28] it and i'm not saying this to get any
[58:30] point of making a point they would make
[58:32] a movie and things and call them
[58:34] superman
[58:35] did he come from this planet of krypton
[58:39] now i'm not talking about nothing like
[58:40] that because remember if it comes from a
[58:42] planet then it couldn't have been
[58:43] created until this went over here and
[58:45] created it so get that out garbage out
[58:47] get the point
[58:53] brother reynolds said he was a super
[58:56] being
[58:59] so that would mean super intelligence
[59:06] just use those things as words
[59:11] to express how real that i believe god
[59:13] is
[59:16] and he had all him attributes in him
[59:19] well he could sit there about two
[59:20] million years and think about how he was
[59:22] going to
[59:23] be a father
[59:30] he's going to display and be a savior
[59:34] i was going to be a healer
[59:39] they wouldn't have to have two million
[59:40] years but that's what i'm what i'm
[59:42] pointing is
[59:43] point is to try to get you to look at
[59:44] something simple
[59:46] if it took two seconds he still was
[59:48] thinking
[59:51] and am i right that he thought that when
[59:54] he made man that man would fall
[59:56] is that true
[59:58] he knew we would fall
[1:00:00] so he must have thought it over
[1:00:02] right
[1:00:04] right
[1:00:06] well that makes it more real than what
[1:00:07] we are
[1:00:09] that's attributes
[1:00:12] in any of those attributes that you deal
[1:00:14] with he could have said millions of
[1:00:16] years and thought about how to do
[1:00:23] you say word brother dale in heaven
[1:00:29] that's the only words we got isn't it
[1:00:31] then we've got heavens of heavens of you
[1:00:33] know
[1:00:37] but that's the word we use signifying
[1:00:39] another place above this one or
[1:00:42] something you know existence
[1:00:46] all right
[1:00:48] you might as well get out of that and
[1:00:50] just go on and forget it
[1:00:52] because if you can't see it
[1:00:54] by that then
[1:00:56] i don't know what else i could say
[1:00:59] and remember one thing
[1:01:02] hebrews 13 8 said he's the same
[1:01:04] yesterday today and forever
[1:01:08] so whatever was here has got to be here
[1:01:11] whatever here's got to be there
[1:01:13] no editions or hebrews 13 8 would be
[1:01:16] wrong
[1:01:17] all right
[1:01:18] then so would it be wrong in
[1:01:21] um
[1:01:22] malachi 3 and 6 i believe where he said
[1:01:24] i'm god and i change not right
[1:01:27] all right
[1:01:28] so let's just run through a little bit
[1:01:30] of what
[1:01:31] the prophet had to say
[1:01:34] watch it real carefully then in a minute
[1:01:35] we'll start reading on the message of
[1:01:38] the unveiling of god paragraph 88 he
[1:01:40] says
[1:01:42] down through the ages the same word
[1:01:46] so he did not change his nature when he
[1:01:49] come
[1:01:50] he is always that prophet he's even
[1:01:52] talking about that part all down through
[1:01:54] the age
[1:01:55] same thing the word the word the word
[1:01:57] the word
[1:01:58] see he cannot change his nature
[1:02:02] but he changed his form
[1:02:06] hebrews 13 8 he's the same yesterday
[1:02:08] today forever he just changed his mask
[1:02:15] all right
[1:02:16] see then if that's what it is
[1:02:20] then
[1:02:22] why are we concerned about the
[1:02:24] condescending part
[1:02:25] when
[1:02:26] we know that he
[1:02:28] all he done was just change the form
[1:02:35] yeah
[1:02:37] he didn't change his nature write that
[1:02:38] word nature down till we get back we
[1:02:40] won't get it today
[1:02:41] i told you the other day i was listening
[1:02:42] to the message i suppose you i'd write
[1:02:44] down nature
[1:02:45] uh if i was you i'd go home look up a
[1:02:47] little bit about nature
[1:02:48] you might find something enjoyable
[1:02:52] look at the next one we'll read for a
[1:02:53] little while the mighty god unveiled
[1:02:55] before us 1964 paragraph 35
[1:02:58] coming through from 34.
[1:03:02] and dr scofield you'll find here that
[1:03:04] his word changing from form we find the
[1:03:06] word in morphe in the greek which means
[1:03:08] the unseen was made visible something
[1:03:11] that cannot we know it's there
[1:03:16] all right
[1:03:17] it can be cannot be seen but yet we know
[1:03:21] that it's dire
[1:03:25] now we know it's there
[1:03:27] you know brother ruddell i remember him
[1:03:29] years ago he had a real good saying he
[1:03:31] said anybody one-eyed and high cents and
[1:03:32] that stuck with me i laugh every time i
[1:03:35] think of it you you get that point
[1:03:38] anyway invited with one odd and half
[1:03:39] cents
[1:03:41] that way
[1:03:42] that's pretty good but listen
[1:03:46] and when he changed his form
[1:03:48] of the amorphy which means that he
[1:03:51] changed from supernatural
[1:03:53] to natural
[1:03:56] and he just changed his mask
[1:03:58] in other words it's like the drama he
[1:04:00] was acting in the greek and they would
[1:04:02] change their mass maybe one play you
[1:04:04] know player might have acted in several
[1:04:07] parts
[1:04:08] he just changed his mask in order to
[1:04:11] come out to the impersonate another
[1:04:13] character
[1:04:15] all right so that's coming downward
[1:04:18] all right
[1:04:21] and when you do
[1:04:24] look at what he's covering
[1:04:26] go ahead with number eight it's pretty
[1:04:28] good reading of
[1:04:29] questions and answers on genesis
[1:04:31] we'll start with
[1:04:34] verse
[1:04:37] 26.
[1:04:40] now no man has seen the father at any
[1:04:42] time no man has seen god in the bodily
[1:04:44] form because god is not in body form god
[1:04:46] is a spirit see all right no man has
[1:04:49] seen the father
[1:04:50] but the only begotten of the father hath
[1:04:52] declared him first john okay now we've
[1:04:55] been through that we've expressed it
[1:04:58] when he says that he
[1:04:59] that god is a spirit we went through
[1:05:02] giving many of it and we'll give a few
[1:05:04] more but he he said god is a spiritual
[1:05:06] being
[1:05:08] and he's not like the wind that just
[1:05:10] floats around
[1:05:13] but see we still hook but god is a
[1:05:16] spirit
[1:05:20] well what image is he going to create
[1:05:23] the man now eventually
[1:05:25] that's right
[1:05:26] are you going to create him a spirit
[1:05:31] mother where do we get there
[1:05:33] but i notice now there's nothing there's
[1:05:36] just space there's no light there's no
[1:05:38] dark
[1:05:39] there's no nothing it just seems nothing
[1:05:43] but entire is a great supernatural being
[1:05:47] in all of this
[1:05:48] nothing is a great supernatural being
[1:05:52] jehovah god who covered all space
[1:05:54] of all places of all times he was from
[1:05:57] everlasting from everlasting
[1:06:00] he is the beginning of creation that's
[1:06:03] god god
[1:06:04] can't god can't see nothing but
[1:06:07] can't hear nothing not a move woman adam
[1:06:10] he's talking about what was back darcy
[1:06:12] but yet god was there and that was god
[1:06:15] and what's down a few minutes
[1:06:17] no man has seen
[1:06:19] that
[1:06:20] now that's the father
[1:06:22] that's god the father
[1:06:24] then after a while i began to see a
[1:06:26] little sacred light begin to form now
[1:06:30] if we had the drawing up
[1:06:32] you would realize you just stepped on
[1:06:34] the other side now that's the first time
[1:06:36] that i've stepped on the other side
[1:06:39] uh all i've been before has been back
[1:06:41] here on this side
[1:06:43] in eternity
[1:06:45] now we step over
[1:06:47] and we start into what is the creation
[1:06:49] now watch the creation then and you'll
[1:06:51] see what i'm talking about this morning
[1:06:54] who created all things
[1:06:57] the son
[1:07:01] because he stepped across but what was
[1:07:03] that son god
[1:07:05] in another form called a son
[1:07:08] and created all time
[1:07:10] right
[1:07:11] see the sacred light began to form like
[1:07:14] a little halo or something you're going
[1:07:15] to see it by spiritual eyes
[1:07:18] to look now while we're looking in the
[1:07:20] whole whole church now and we're
[1:07:23] standing on a great big banister
[1:07:25] watching what god's doing
[1:07:27] and we'll get right down to this
[1:07:29] question here what people were talking
[1:07:31] to
[1:07:33] now no one has seen god
[1:07:35] and now the next thing we begin to see
[1:07:37] by eyes of supernatural looking we see a
[1:07:40] little white light
[1:07:42] forming out there what is that
[1:07:45] it was called by bible readers logos
[1:07:49] or the anointed or the anointing
[1:07:53] or the as i was going to say
[1:07:57] the part of god
[1:07:59] began to develop into something so human
[1:08:02] beings could have some type of an idea
[1:08:06] what it was
[1:08:07] it was a little low a little light
[1:08:11] moving he that was the word of god
[1:08:16] now god gave himself birth to this son
[1:08:20] in which the son which was before there
[1:08:23] was even an atom
[1:08:26] and remember when we moved over i said
[1:08:28] you don't start time
[1:08:32] see we want to start time when we jump
[1:08:34] over from eternity
[1:08:36] you got to seven days creation that's
[1:08:38] fine but time really began when sin come
[1:08:41] into the world
[1:08:43] right
[1:08:45] because remember it says god created
[1:08:50] watch now now god gave himself birth to
[1:08:52] the son which was before there was even
[1:08:55] an adam in the our hour to make an adam
[1:08:58] that was jesus said glorify me father
[1:09:01] with the glory that
[1:09:02] we had before the foundation of the
[1:09:04] world see way back in yonder
[1:09:07] now jesus could say that the flesh
[1:09:09] wasn't talking right
[1:09:12] flesh wasn't before world
[1:09:15] pride
[1:09:16] right
[1:09:18] so now who's talking
[1:09:22] god who stepped over
[1:09:25] in another form
[1:09:26] but remember when he stepped over
[1:09:29] it was only part
[1:09:34] one of those attributes i pointed out
[1:09:35] while ago can be the fullness of god but
[1:09:38] they can also be just apart
[1:09:42] ours we're going to take a revelation
[1:09:47] because of our mind twisting
[1:09:49] of that word part
[1:09:52] and he goes on talking about john 1
[1:09:54] and the word was god and the word was
[1:09:56] made flesh and dwelt among us god
[1:09:59] unfolded himself down to a human being
[1:10:01] now watch how he did it now back there
[1:10:04] now that's what i said and i was going
[1:10:05] to caution you when you come because
[1:10:08] when he gets over brother ranum is
[1:10:10] explaining before the world and then
[1:10:12] he's explaining after the world how
[1:10:14] jesus come into being
[1:10:16] but just remember one points okay
[1:10:21] if he's explaining after he comes into
[1:10:23] being he can't come into being no other
[1:10:25] way than what he was
[1:10:28] before right
[1:10:32] so don't get all confused why he don't
[1:10:34] know what he's talking about because
[1:10:35] that's talking about jesus coming into
[1:10:38] the world
[1:10:40] well that's exactly what i'm talking
[1:10:41] about that's how he started from back
[1:10:43] there to come down to where he could
[1:10:44] come out to be jesus standing here
[1:10:51] right
[1:10:53] when this little halo of light
[1:10:56] we can't see nothing yet but just by the
[1:10:58] eyes are just supernatural we see a halo
[1:11:00] standing there now that's the son of god
[1:11:03] the logos and i can see him playing
[1:11:05] around like a little child before the
[1:11:08] father's door
[1:11:10] think that's something ain't no
[1:11:12] theologian to figure that out
[1:11:14] and you and i can't either
[1:11:18] you're gonna have to believe it to let
[1:11:19] god reveal it
[1:11:21] right see the son of god the logos now i
[1:11:23] can see him playing around like a little
[1:11:26] child here child before the father's
[1:11:28] door
[1:11:29] and what
[1:11:31] he'll come in another quote a minute and
[1:11:32] he said now see there's where it said in
[1:11:34] the beginning was the word
[1:11:37] all right now remember he's a little
[1:11:39] child playing before the father's door
[1:11:42] then
[1:11:42] what i was reading this morning was
[1:11:44] right
[1:11:45] jesus christ is the creator
[1:11:49] the father is not creating
[1:11:53] it's the father in the form of the son
[1:11:56] or else you've missed all them
[1:11:57] scriptures i gave this morning
[1:12:01] i changed a lot this morning because the
[1:12:02] company
[1:12:03] that was fine but
[1:12:05] i didn't change a lot because all that
[1:12:07] was in my mind earthling
[1:12:12] remember all those scriptures verify
[1:12:14] that jesus christ
[1:12:19] was the creator
[1:12:22] these quotes are verifying the same
[1:12:24] thing
[1:12:25] i can see him playing around like a
[1:12:26] little child before the father's door
[1:12:28] with all eternity
[1:12:31] and now then in his imagination who
[1:12:35] the son of god
[1:12:38] is that who he's explaining
[1:12:41] all right
[1:12:42] in his an imaginary makeup he began to
[1:12:45] think of what things would be
[1:12:48] and i can hear him say
[1:12:51] let there be light
[1:12:53] and when he did an atom bursted and the
[1:12:55] sun came into existence
[1:13:02] remember wednesday night brother louise
[1:13:04] done a good job of what he was
[1:13:06] explaining
[1:13:08] you remember what he was talking about
[1:13:10] in the basis that
[1:13:12] uh
[1:13:14] god that gay
[1:13:16] adam
[1:13:18] the ability
[1:13:20] to name all the animals
[1:13:23] right
[1:13:24] now where'd he get that from
[1:13:29] it wasn't a guess and a hit and a mess
[1:13:32] well that looked like a bear so i'll
[1:13:33] call it a bear he didn't have no bear to
[1:13:35] look at
[1:13:36] right
[1:13:37] right
[1:13:40] when these days we'll realize why over
[1:13:42] in the old testament that a man could
[1:13:44] walk out there one day and he said lord
[1:13:46] i'll give you everything i got he said i
[1:13:49] don't want that he said i'll give you 10
[1:13:52] where do you think he got that thought
[1:13:54] from
[1:13:56] where do you think
[1:13:57] moses got to thought to write what
[1:13:59] happened in genesis
[1:14:02] it was moses thought yeah
[1:14:04] it was adam's thought and word but who
[1:14:07] was directing his thoughts
[1:14:14] come on
[1:14:16] let there be
[1:14:18] name it a squirrel name it a bear name
[1:14:20] it a horse
[1:14:22] coming from god down through a human
[1:14:25] being though
[1:14:27] that would speak it out
[1:14:33] and remember
[1:14:36] he was speaking it out before he went
[1:14:38] into human flesh
[1:14:41] because he was leading the animals
[1:14:43] then when he got into human flesh he
[1:14:44] could surely bring out what god wanted
[1:14:46] to call them
[1:14:47] but you got to put them two together
[1:14:48] because if you don't you're going to run
[1:14:50] into trouble but you understand what i'm
[1:14:52] getting at
[1:14:57] where do you think this one
[1:14:59] then watch
[1:15:00] and now then in his imaginary makeup
[1:15:04] the son
[1:15:06] of god
[1:15:10] where did he get the talk from
[1:15:15] if he was another person
[1:15:17] you had to direct it down one to the
[1:15:19] other
[1:15:20] but if he was the person
[1:15:22] then whatever was back on this side of
[1:15:24] the
[1:15:25] world of the thoughts of god in his mind
[1:15:28] would come over on the other side are
[1:15:30] you with me
[1:15:33] and then you can say let us make man
[1:15:35] now you've got not two people
[1:15:40] right that's right amen
[1:15:42] come on
[1:15:44] you understand what the prophet is
[1:15:45] getting to
[1:15:46] when he begin when he got his imaginary
[1:15:48] mind when he got everything he picks up
[1:15:50] the thought the thought is transmitted
[1:15:53] down and when it's transmitted down here
[1:15:56] stands the logos the speech the son of
[1:15:59] god the christ and he said
[1:16:01] let us make man
[1:16:03] right amen
[1:16:05] there's father and son
[1:16:07] or if you wanted another way to help you
[1:16:08] to understand there's word and spirit
[1:16:11] that's right
[1:16:12] that's right word spirit of one right if
[1:16:14] it's quicker
[1:16:16] you understand what i'm getting at
[1:16:19] then you're going to find out the
[1:16:20] prophet is saying
[1:16:22] that that logos that speech
[1:16:25] is speaking the things into existence
[1:16:28] playing before the father's door the son
[1:16:31] of god
[1:16:35] and he can say
[1:16:36] let us
[1:16:40] because there's two forms of god's there
[1:16:47] the great eternal
[1:16:49] and the son of god
[1:16:53] okay
[1:16:54] are you listening yes
[1:16:57] playing around before the father's door
[1:16:59] look at the next one which goes into the
[1:17:01] message called life
[1:17:03] uh e22
[1:17:08] let's close our eyes to our imagination
[1:17:10] for a few moments and go back into there
[1:17:12] before there was anything the great
[1:17:14] fountain of eternity the spirit and all
[1:17:16] the honesty what it do then out of the
[1:17:18] existence of the father went the logos
[1:17:21] which was the son
[1:17:26] that's plain language to me
[1:17:30] if it confuses you i suggest you pray
[1:17:32] because out of the existence of the
[1:17:35] father
[1:17:36] could move over into another form
[1:17:40] and i will keep making this statement
[1:17:43] that a part of god went out
[1:17:47] called a son we'll read them quotes in a
[1:17:49] minute
[1:17:55] he said brother dale is it necessary for
[1:17:57] us to understand these things yes
[1:18:03] is it necessary for us to understand
[1:18:07] father han son and holy ghost
[1:18:08] comparisons of the lord jesus christ
[1:18:11] in water baptism
[1:18:15] if one of the part of the word is
[1:18:16] important
[1:18:19] i thought all of it was
[1:18:27] if i was out here trying to bring some
[1:18:29] great discourse
[1:18:31] without reading what your prophet said
[1:18:34] you could make that statement that we
[1:18:36] don't need this
[1:18:38] but when the prophet brought it
[1:18:41] that's right i thought
[1:18:43] that he came to bring us
[1:18:46] the word
[1:18:48] well you know when these are
[1:18:50] this was preached in 1953.
[1:18:53] questions and answers on genesis
[1:18:59] right
[1:19:02] brother ray was mentioning the other day
[1:19:03] a message called who is god
[1:19:05] now you have to look at it sometimes
[1:19:07] it'll say attitude and who is god
[1:19:09] um
[1:19:10] 1950
[1:19:12] is it 7 29 1950 it's 1950
[1:19:15] and brother branham is explaining these
[1:19:17] things there's a couple of quotes in
[1:19:18] here in a minute
[1:19:22] see go back to those ole miss we're
[1:19:24] going to get over into the third pool
[1:19:26] after the steel's broke
[1:19:34] if we don't understand this
[1:19:37] don't be concerned with the seals
[1:19:40] don't be concerned with the rapture
[1:19:43] don't be concerned with those things
[1:19:49] but you see when i quote things like
[1:19:50] that people get all upset
[1:19:53] brother branham said if you don't
[1:19:54] understand daniel 70 weeks you can't
[1:19:56] understand the seals but nobody wants to
[1:19:57] preach on daniel 70 weeks
[1:20:01] i didn't make that statement it's in the
[1:20:03] book that's right
[1:20:06] i'm the smart elect that found it
[1:20:10] right amen
[1:20:11] but look
[1:20:12] then out of the existence of the father
[1:20:14] went the logos
[1:20:16] which was the son okay all god was
[1:20:21] he poured into christ
[1:20:26] his pouring in was way back
[1:20:30] there that's where it's going you don't
[1:20:33] have to listen one of these days if i
[1:20:34] ever get enough time
[1:20:36] to get to it
[1:20:38] i told you 40 years ago i said i see
[1:20:40] something but i can't explain it
[1:20:43] that's no longer that
[1:20:44] day amen
[1:20:48] that son of god was god in another form
[1:20:52] not another god
[1:20:57] or either english missed its wording
[1:21:00] then out of the existence of the father
[1:21:02] went the logos did it do away with the
[1:21:04] father
[1:21:06] it enhanced the father
[1:21:09] it made the father into a greater view
[1:21:12] which was the theophany
[1:21:14] which was the body that great jehovah
[1:21:16] god went forth in a celestial body
[1:21:19] that's the logos the word spoke out of
[1:21:22] them great fountains of life and went
[1:21:24] forth and there was the theophany which
[1:21:27] was god made into
[1:21:30] word amen
[1:21:38] his words
[1:21:43] let's read on
[1:21:45] number 10 preparation
[1:21:51] sitting way back in eternity that was
[1:21:53] god and then going out of god this is 19
[1:21:56] and 53
[1:21:57] 11 11.
[1:22:01] then going out of god are god unfolding
[1:22:03] himself
[1:22:05] come the logos
[1:22:06] which was the son of god
[1:22:09] are the word of god
[1:22:13] see now you're getting to the john 1.
[1:22:16] the beginning was the word with god and
[1:22:17] the word was god now you're getting your
[1:22:19] book because that's what he's saying
[1:22:20] here
[1:22:21] in the beginning was the word with god
[1:22:22] and the word was god and the word was
[1:22:24] made flesh and dwelt among us the logos
[1:22:27] now watch we're seeing god
[1:22:29] unfold himself
[1:22:34] then he said in genesis
[1:22:37] let us make man in her own image
[1:22:41] what kind of a man was he
[1:22:47] he had to be a spirit man
[1:22:52] he's in the image of god
[1:22:54] but we want to make him a spirit
[1:22:57] um
[1:23:00] your god's not real if you got him just
[1:23:02] a spirit floating around
[1:23:07] because he's not like the wind he's not
[1:23:08] like the air come on
[1:23:11] look
[1:23:12] he had to be a spirit man and then he
[1:23:15] put him in five senses to contact his
[1:23:17] earthly home
[1:23:19] you might give him a foot like a bar and
[1:23:21] a hand like a monkey i don't know what
[1:23:23] he did
[1:23:26] genesis is one man
[1:23:28] let us make man our image was put in the
[1:23:30] flesh in genesis 2 right
[1:23:36] is that true
[1:23:37] i mean that scripture or with it
[1:23:40] see who was that that was created then
[1:23:43] in genesis
[1:23:44] let us make man whatever
[1:23:49] whatever
[1:23:50] the image
[1:23:53] that the man came into
[1:23:56] if it's right according to the
[1:23:57] scriptures
[1:23:58] and the prophet it's the same image when
[1:24:01] the man is brought right that's right
[1:24:04] i'm talking about his flesh man get off
[1:24:06] of him
[1:24:07] spirit man
[1:24:11] and whatever the image is it's got to be
[1:24:14] the image of the father and the son amen
[1:24:19] because let us
[1:24:22] man you're close to trinitarianism
[1:24:25] i love to walk here
[1:24:29] because here is where i dwell
[1:24:34] look at the next one
[1:24:36] thirsting for life
[1:24:41] and i have the catholic people hear
[1:24:44] the book called facts of our faith and
[1:24:46] they use the word of eternal sonship of
[1:24:48] god the word don't even make sense to me
[1:24:51] the word eternal means eternity which
[1:24:54] had no beginning or has no end
[1:24:56] and son means had a beginning
[1:24:59] so how could it be
[1:25:01] it could be a eternal
[1:25:04] godship
[1:25:09] but never an eternal sonship
[1:25:16] remember the quote just before then out
[1:25:18] of the existence of the father came the
[1:25:19] son
[1:25:23] now you're making two out of it
[1:25:31] what about an eternal godship
[1:25:34] amen
[1:25:36] you believe in the eternal god head i've
[1:25:39] got one in here that he did
[1:25:42] now according to my understanding what
[1:25:44] do you mean when you say godhead
[1:25:46] father son holy ghost make godhead right
[1:25:50] well what about an eternal godhead
[1:25:57] you better make the son the father in
[1:25:59] another form or you just lost your
[1:26:02] wording and trapped your own self
[1:26:08] no
[1:26:10] okay
[1:26:12] it could be an eternal godship but never
[1:26:15] an eternal sonship a certain one is
[1:26:17] that's begotten of so it had to so it
[1:26:20] had a beginning so the logos which was
[1:26:22] the son of god went out created by these
[1:26:25] great fountains of purity
[1:26:27] god
[1:26:28] as those spirits went out and it created
[1:26:31] the logos
[1:26:33] you know the word probably using the
[1:26:34] word create and it was a body
[1:26:38] it was in the form
[1:26:41] of what we are now
[1:26:47] which is called in clergy way of
[1:26:49] speaking
[1:26:50] a theophany
[1:26:56] it's a body that doesn't have a spirit
[1:26:58] in it
[1:27:01] it's a body that's waiting for you
[1:27:03] christians
[1:27:05] as soon as you die
[1:27:08] and you remember now because we're
[1:27:10] getting into something now we're going
[1:27:11] to pick up some ground
[1:27:13] you remember when brother branham went
[1:27:15] beyond the curtain of time the angel of
[1:27:17] the lord said this is theophany
[1:27:20] he said that's where he saw him in
[1:27:22] theophany
[1:27:23] remember he could feel him
[1:27:26] he could see him
[1:27:28] he could hear him
[1:27:36] well we're getting to something real
[1:27:44] think about it
[1:27:49] okay
[1:27:51] let's go to the next one
[1:27:55] questions and answers on hebrews
[1:27:58] this is the part 2
[1:28:00] 57
[1:28:02] 10 02.
[1:28:04] now he says it don't even make sense
[1:28:05] eternal sonship of god
[1:28:07] see there cannot be an eternal son
[1:28:10] because a son had to have a beginning
[1:28:13] and so jesus had a beginning
[1:28:18] now show me where he ever said to christ
[1:28:20] at the beginning
[1:28:22] jesus the flesh
[1:28:24] had a beginning
[1:28:26] right
[1:28:28] okay
[1:28:32] so jesus had a beginning god had no
[1:28:34] beginning see but the son was
[1:28:37] not eternal sonship
[1:28:40] but the son that was with the father
[1:28:43] in the beginning was the logos that went
[1:28:46] out of god
[1:28:52] god in another form
[1:28:55] you want the quotes ahead of time a part
[1:28:57] of god
[1:29:01] and it was the theophany of god that
[1:29:03] went out the human form that didn't have
[1:29:05] eyes like you
[1:29:07] see
[1:29:07] a better eye
[1:29:15] he didn't have ears like you
[1:29:18] here but far more hearing
[1:29:21] it was a see it was a theophany and all
[1:29:24] this rainbow condescended into theophany
[1:29:27] moses saw it when it passed through the
[1:29:30] rock like that he saw the back part said
[1:29:33] it looked like a man
[1:29:36] well you know brother brandon when he
[1:29:37] saw those people beyond the curtain of
[1:29:39] time
[1:29:40] they were real
[1:29:41] right
[1:29:43] that's right they were not spirits
[1:29:45] floating around hey brother branham you
[1:29:47] remember in his early ministry
[1:29:50] if you think i can't remember decent
[1:29:53] you remember in his early ministry he
[1:29:54] thought that's what they'd be you
[1:29:56] remember that he thought they would be
[1:29:58] he said brother neville i couldn't shake
[1:30:00] his hand he said caught his hands in the
[1:30:02] grave
[1:30:03] he said but i see him and i know he's
[1:30:05] standing there
[1:30:08] but then when he went beyond the curtain
[1:30:09] of time he come back and he said they're
[1:30:11] real
[1:30:16] one of these days we're going to realize
[1:30:18] eternal life is real
[1:30:22] eternal life is not thoughts and ideas
[1:30:25] it's a person
[1:30:29] here's the message who is god go to
[1:30:31] number 13
[1:30:33] priest in 1958-15
[1:30:36] right
[1:30:38] great space and
[1:30:40] no way to confathom it and
[1:30:43] he said that's jehovah god out there and
[1:30:45] we're taught in the beginning that the
[1:30:47] logos or the son of god went out of god
[1:30:49] i do not believe in eternal sonship
[1:30:53] that's even radical to even mention such
[1:30:55] a thing eternal sonship how he had a
[1:30:59] eternal
[1:31:00] he had a eternal sonship now watch him
[1:31:03] what he's not saying
[1:31:05] that he was eternal sonship it's even
[1:31:08] it's even eternal sonship how could it
[1:31:11] be a son
[1:31:13] see he's not saying that there could be
[1:31:14] an eternal sonship
[1:31:16] he's explained it not so look what he
[1:31:18] said so he first was god jehovah and out
[1:31:20] of him let's just picture now as a
[1:31:23] little drama so you can get it
[1:31:25] let's see coming out of space where
[1:31:27] there's nothing
[1:31:28] let's make it a little white light like
[1:31:30] a mystic light
[1:31:32] like a halo
[1:31:33] that was the logos that went off god in
[1:31:35] the beginning that was the son of god
[1:31:37] that came out of the bosom of the father
[1:31:41] that was what was in the beginning was
[1:31:44] the word and the word was with god and
[1:31:47] the word god was god and the word was
[1:31:49] made flesh now that's jumping all the
[1:31:50] way to the flesh man and dwelt among us
[1:31:53] in the beginning was god and then out of
[1:31:56] god came to logos
[1:31:59] a part of god
[1:32:01] that went out of god
[1:32:07] now
[1:32:09] a part of god
[1:32:12] that went out of god
[1:32:16] but brother hell
[1:32:18] oh you i thought i had it figured out
[1:32:21] all these years i've been studying it
[1:32:24] and now you're dividing him up in pieces
[1:32:28] no i'm not that's right
[1:32:33] simple terminologies to me
[1:32:36] father
[1:32:40] steps over into son
[1:32:46] steps on over in the holy ghost
[1:32:49] same god
[1:32:53] yeah but you just don't understand we'll
[1:32:55] explain this
[1:32:57] that son that you believe to be almighty
[1:33:00] god in human flesh
[1:33:02] and we believe that right we believe in
[1:33:04] him was the fullness of the godhead
[1:33:05] bodily we believe that
[1:33:07] you know that he didn't know when he was
[1:33:09] coming back right
[1:33:12] and brother randall said he didn't know
[1:33:13] his part in the kingdom
[1:33:16] until he come to the isle of patmos
[1:33:22] i thought i had it figured out i was
[1:33:23] beginning to see it
[1:33:25] and now you
[1:33:27] skunk me again
[1:33:30] all right now you're gonna have to pray
[1:33:33] rolling up a little further because
[1:33:34] you're more to that
[1:33:36] where is that that depart okay
[1:33:40] i was looking for e17 yeah that's it
[1:33:43] and then there now we see this just like
[1:33:46] a child playing before the door
[1:33:48] it was the son of god the logos i can
[1:33:50] see him out there
[1:33:51] and he spake and said
[1:33:53] let there be light
[1:33:55] and there was nothing
[1:33:57] but there was something happened and
[1:33:59] adam burst adam turned there and began
[1:34:01] to whirl around this way the sun began
[1:34:04] to come into existence
[1:34:05] because he said let there be
[1:34:08] there's the authority where did he make
[1:34:10] it from i don't know
[1:34:13] there was nothing to make it from but he
[1:34:15] believed his own word
[1:34:17] and there was light and i can see a
[1:34:19] piece fly off of that
[1:34:21] it's a meteor
[1:34:22] after a few million years or 100 million
[1:34:25] big hundred billions of years
[1:34:27] you want to call it and it circled way
[1:34:29] out i see him standing there watching it
[1:34:34] and it falls down in here
[1:34:36] he stops it after it falls a few million
[1:34:39] years
[1:34:40] and let it hang out there in orbit
[1:34:43] here comes another one flying off the
[1:34:45] sun and goes over here and hangs there
[1:34:48] stopped it there
[1:34:50] what's he doing
[1:34:52] he's making all of the stars and the
[1:34:54] moon
[1:34:55] and the universe and all the things
[1:35:01] from the word
[1:35:09] and we're still tied up
[1:35:11] uh what happened on day one
[1:35:21] world created on day one
[1:35:25] you're already quiet because you're
[1:35:26] afraid to move
[1:35:29] uh-uh
[1:35:31] it says that's why brother brown said it
[1:35:32] don't matter about all these things that
[1:35:34] claim is so old he said it says in the
[1:35:37] beginning god created the heavens and
[1:35:39] the earth period
[1:35:43] and in day one
[1:35:46] things begin to be created
[1:35:48] day one was not creation of the world
[1:35:50] your prophet's right right
[1:35:53] millions of billions of years
[1:35:59] and then day one we'll get to that when
[1:36:01] we get time
[1:36:02] day one this was created day two that
[1:36:04] was created
[1:36:06] showing his nature oh i'd love to get to
[1:36:09] that but watch him in the next one
[1:36:13] the unveiling of god
[1:36:16] paragraph 77 and 78
[1:36:19] and when he said here that he emptied
[1:36:21] himself or poured out they would think
[1:36:23] like this that he vomited up
[1:36:26] the english word of emptied or poured
[1:36:28] out from him see that's what we think it
[1:36:31] it signifies to us the english word
[1:36:34] vomit
[1:36:35] poured out
[1:36:37] something went out of him that was
[1:36:38] different from him
[1:36:41] that's what we think when we're looking
[1:36:43] at the word but the word kinos in the
[1:36:45] greek does not mean that he vomited up
[1:36:48] or something his arm went off or his
[1:36:50] eyes went out another person
[1:36:55] it didn't mean an arm go out and i go
[1:36:56] out or another person
[1:36:58] that is he changed himself he poured
[1:37:00] himself into into another mask into
[1:37:02] another form not another person went out
[1:37:05] of him called the holy spirit but it was
[1:37:08] he himself
[1:37:10] you get it
[1:37:13] not another person went out
[1:37:16] it was he himself
[1:37:18] right
[1:37:21] but keep in mind what he's saying apart
[1:37:22] went out
[1:37:26] now you see why did i bring it and say
[1:37:28] well don't leave an empty space now when
[1:37:30] you say all god what poured into christ
[1:37:32] and all christ into the church just
[1:37:34] don't leave an empty space
[1:37:36] right
[1:37:36] because you're only dealing with what
[1:37:38] god's going to make manifest down here
[1:37:40] and you're only dealing with a part of
[1:37:42] god that's what your prophet is
[1:37:44] explaining go ahead
[1:37:49] what was your explanation
[1:37:51] oh the great father created the son and
[1:37:53] the creator son created the holy ghost
[1:37:55] or
[1:37:56] you know
[1:37:58] you know we're ooh
[1:38:00] i won't get that
[1:38:03] not another person
[1:38:06] me
[1:38:08] into another mask another form not
[1:38:10] another person went out of him called
[1:38:12] the holy spirit but was he himself
[1:38:14] congregation holiday amen
[1:38:17] he poured himself into the people christ
[1:38:19] in you how beautiful how wonderful to
[1:38:21] claim god pouring himself into the human
[1:38:23] being into the believer pour out
[1:38:26] it was a part of his drama to do so
[1:38:29] god all the fullness all the godhead
[1:38:32] bodily was in this person jesus christ
[1:38:36] he was god and god alone not a second
[1:38:38] not a third person or a second person or
[1:38:41] a first person
[1:38:43] but the person
[1:38:45] god failed in human flesh
[1:38:48] let me see how much further i can go
[1:38:51] let's see if we can get these things on
[1:38:52] the part and then i'll quit on the other
[1:38:54] part okay go ahead to the next one which
[1:38:56] is hebrews chapter one
[1:38:59] wait a minute we got to 15.
[1:39:01] i'm better
[1:39:02] 14
[1:39:04] come on steph where you
[1:39:11] let's at on the back of the page i can
[1:39:13] find it
[1:39:14] all right
[1:39:15] show us the father and it'll satisfy us
[1:39:17] look what he says
[1:39:19] and there he come out there was nothing
[1:39:21] and then here come the logos that looked
[1:39:24] like a halo
[1:39:26] hanging under no man has seen god at any
[1:39:29] time now
[1:39:32] and here's the logos
[1:39:33] looks like it's a supernatural being
[1:39:35] it's a halo that's the son of god not
[1:39:38] eternal sonship because the words don't
[1:39:40] do good together that's the catholic
[1:39:43] doctrine but eternal how could it be a
[1:39:45] sonship and be eternal if he's a son
[1:39:48] he'd had to have a beginning of time
[1:39:51] eternals forever see so eternal sonship
[1:39:55] there's no such a word to make that
[1:39:57] sensible but it was the logos that went
[1:40:00] out of god and there he was playing out
[1:40:02] there in space
[1:40:04] just
[1:40:05] like a child before the door i can see
[1:40:08] him draw the whole picture in his mind
[1:40:11] of the kingdom
[1:40:12] and what it might be
[1:40:15] do you have any problems the end of
[1:40:17] saying well
[1:40:18] let us
[1:40:19] the father
[1:40:21] transmitting over or coming over into
[1:40:23] another form called a son
[1:40:26] and he can have so much connection until
[1:40:28] what this father had in mind is in the
[1:40:31] mind of the son
[1:40:33] is that any problem
[1:40:39] you know
[1:40:43] all right
[1:40:49] can you give me about 10 minutes
[1:40:52] okay we'll get this part out of the way
[1:40:53] where i can go on
[1:40:55] look at number 16 because i love this
[1:40:57] hebrews chapter
[1:40:58] five and six part one wrote it up
[1:41:01] god didn't have three persons up there
[1:41:03] and send one of them his son it was god
[1:41:05] himself come in the form of a son
[1:41:10] now brother branham could talk about a
[1:41:11] son being back there
[1:41:14] in the eternities
[1:41:16] and say he didn't believe in eternal
[1:41:18] sonship
[1:41:20] right
[1:41:23] come on
[1:41:24] people want to say brother brandon made
[1:41:26] all these mistakes why don't somebody
[1:41:27] get a hold of something like that
[1:41:30] that's got even a little sense to it but
[1:41:32] it ain't got no sense if you go on and
[1:41:34] read
[1:41:36] he's talking about something existing
[1:41:39] with the father that's eternal and says
[1:41:42] he don't believe in eternal sonship
[1:41:45] within the sun would have to be the
[1:41:46] father made manifest
[1:41:49] in another form
[1:41:50] right
[1:41:51] right or else you got eternal sonship
[1:41:54] okay
[1:41:56] god didn't have three people up there
[1:41:58] and send one of them his son it was god
[1:42:00] himself come in the form of a son
[1:42:05] a son has a beginning and the son had a
[1:42:07] beginning
[1:42:08] that some of you dear catholic people i
[1:42:10] got your book facts of our faith the
[1:42:12] eternal sonship he said how could that
[1:42:13] be
[1:42:14] that word is not right for everything
[1:42:16] that's a son had a beginning
[1:42:18] and eternal has no beginning so it isn't
[1:42:21] eternal sonship christ become the flesh
[1:42:25] and dwelt among us he had a beginning
[1:42:27] wasn't no eternal sonship it's the
[1:42:30] eternal godhead
[1:42:33] not sonship
[1:42:35] now he came to redeem us and he didn't
[1:42:37] read
[1:42:38] and he did redeem us go on to the next
[1:42:40] let's read feist
[1:42:42] this is so us the father
[1:42:46] and look what he said let us plural make
[1:42:48] man plural in our image
[1:42:52] what was he there is this supernatural
[1:42:54] being there's the one that could not be
[1:42:56] seen god the father never was seen never
[1:42:59] will be seen
[1:43:00] he's all
[1:43:01] nature
[1:43:02] and there he is and now here's the son
[1:43:06] which is the logos that went out of him
[1:43:08] made into his image a supernatural being
[1:43:11] that went out in the beginning
[1:43:16] i'll be glad to give you these of you i
[1:43:18] started to just do them all off
[1:43:21] you know and let you read all of these
[1:43:23] but
[1:43:24] questions and answers on genesis 53
[1:43:28] he made the sun the first thing you know
[1:43:30] a big clinker
[1:43:33] a big clinker fell off of it weighed
[1:43:35] just about like this earth and went
[1:43:37] through
[1:43:38] then this logos here now the son of god
[1:43:41] is watching it he lets it fall for 100
[1:43:43] million years and he stops it then
[1:43:45] another one flies off and he lets it fly
[1:43:48] off the flew off
[1:43:51] fall for millions of years then he stops
[1:43:53] it
[1:43:54] and we're standing watching this as it
[1:43:56] comes into existence
[1:44:00] he's got something in his mind he went
[1:44:01] on to say
[1:44:05] look at these now for a minute
[1:44:08] and if i just sketch down through it
[1:44:10] forgive me
[1:44:11] and read what we're getting at i'm going
[1:44:13] to go to paragraph 128
[1:44:15] bring it on up because save time now
[1:44:17] that's the reason back down you know too
[1:44:20] far let me get this no no
[1:44:23] judgment doesn't follow law and law you
[1:44:24] know and when judgment was passed by law
[1:44:27] which brings death and there's no one
[1:44:29] could pay that the penalty but god
[1:44:31] himself and he paid the penalty of our
[1:44:34] death and took our sins upon him
[1:44:37] that we might be the righteousness of
[1:44:38] god through him now when these great
[1:44:40] lights went out are the great rays of
[1:44:43] spirit love peace that's all there was
[1:44:46] that there wasn't no suffering there
[1:44:49] wasn't no hate no malice it couldn't
[1:44:51] come from this fountain that was jehovah
[1:44:54] that was jehovah god and now as the
[1:44:56] theologians call it a theophany went out
[1:44:59] from that which was called in the
[1:45:02] scripture the logos the logos that went
[1:45:05] out of god it's hard to explain but it
[1:45:08] was a part of god
[1:45:14] now don't connect that as
[1:45:16] god in part
[1:45:19] it's a part of god there's a lot of
[1:45:21] difference in the two statements right
[1:45:23] a part of god can be
[1:45:26] god made manifest
[1:45:29] but don't try to divide him up in parts
[1:45:32] all right at thy word go ahead let's get
[1:45:34] fires
[1:45:35] so the first no
[1:45:38] okay who is
[1:45:40] so he first was god jehovah and out of
[1:45:42] him let's just picture now as a little
[1:45:44] drama so we can get it let's see coming
[1:45:46] out of space where there's nothing let's
[1:45:47] make it a little white light like a
[1:45:49] mystic like like a halo then i read that
[1:45:51] and white on him in the beginning that
[1:45:52] was the son of god that came out of the
[1:45:54] wisdom of the father i'd already read
[1:45:56] that that's logos part of god okay go to
[1:45:58] the next sorry about that
[1:46:00] next one is that thy word 1951.
[1:46:03] you talk about even the holy spirit and
[1:46:05] angels and all that was just attributes
[1:46:08] of god it's just a part of god
[1:46:11] it's his makeup
[1:46:13] it's part of it that went out his spirit
[1:46:16] and so forth that he created to be his
[1:46:18] helpers around to the great see all
[1:46:20] right
[1:46:22] keep on reading grab the next one
[1:46:27] this is taken from the unveiling of god
[1:46:30] all right his arm went off his eye went
[1:46:32] out because that's what the greek word
[1:46:34] means in vomit count but it's not the
[1:46:36] kinos word
[1:46:38] that is he changed himself
[1:46:40] he poured himself into amen
[1:46:43] into another mask into another form not
[1:46:45] another person went out of hymn called
[1:46:47] the holy spirit but it was he himself
[1:46:50] you get it the congregation says amen he
[1:46:53] he himself poured himself into the
[1:46:55] people christ in you how beautiful how
[1:46:57] wonderful i done read this but i want to
[1:46:58] read again himself into the human being
[1:47:00] and to the believer pour out it was part
[1:47:02] of his drama all right go to the next i
[1:47:05] wanted to read that again because a lot
[1:47:06] of these i repeat
[1:47:08] taken from the message curtain of time
[1:47:10] god which was a part of god
[1:47:12] god seen what the end would be from the
[1:47:14] beginning and the logos come to the
[1:47:15] earth which was the christ the word
[1:47:17] spoken word of god part of god and was
[1:47:20] made flesh and dwelt among us and there
[1:47:23] and then we come out of christ which
[1:47:26] makes the same life that was in god in
[1:47:28] christ in you
[1:47:31] all right
[1:47:33] what is the problem
[1:47:35] go to the next one
[1:47:38] this is questions and answers on genesis
[1:47:43] he was in other words adam
[1:47:46] the first man in the lower creation of
[1:47:48] god
[1:47:49] the first creation you know this quote
[1:47:50] because we did it before the first
[1:47:52] creation was god himself then out of god
[1:47:54] came the logos which was the son of god
[1:47:55] that out of the logos which was the word
[1:47:57] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:47:58] word with god and the word was god and
[1:48:00] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:48:02] us out of the low guys came forth what
[1:48:04] the man
[1:48:07] genesis 1
[1:48:09] 26
[1:48:11] the man
[1:48:13] all right
[1:48:14] then where are we going
[1:48:16] look at the revelation of jesus christ
[1:48:22] page 34 really church age book
[1:48:24] would you like an old testament type
[1:48:26] let's go back to the garden of eden when
[1:48:27] the first news came to glory that the
[1:48:29] son adam had been lost did god send an
[1:48:32] angel
[1:48:33] did he send a son did he send another
[1:48:35] one like unto us no he came himself to
[1:48:38] redeem that lost son hallelujah god did
[1:48:41] not entrust his god did not entrust his
[1:48:44] plan of salvation to another watch it
[1:48:48] he trusted it only himself
[1:48:51] god was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:48:53] and redeemed us unto himself we're saved
[1:48:55] by the blood of god the eternal god in
[1:48:58] dwell a mortal body
[1:49:00] in order to take away sin he became the
[1:49:03] lamb in order to shed his blood and
[1:49:05] enter into the veil go to the next
[1:49:11] this is the message
[1:49:13] and thy seed shall possess
[1:49:15] in the garden of eden when
[1:49:17] god had to his knowledge and true to his
[1:49:20] word
[1:49:21] when eve and adam had done evil when god
[1:49:24] himself running up and down through the
[1:49:26] garden hollering adam adam where art
[1:49:29] thou
[1:49:30] where art thou adam if somebody wants to
[1:49:32] know where who this man was
[1:49:35] jesus who was he
[1:49:38] coming hunting his first lost son did
[1:49:42] god sent an angel
[1:49:44] he come himself
[1:49:46] he came himself
[1:49:49] right
[1:49:50] okay go to the next one
[1:49:53] this is taken from the message jehovah
[1:49:55] jireh
[1:49:57] and another thing did you notice
[1:49:59] god never sent an angel down to hunt up
[1:50:01] his lost child he came himself that's
[1:50:03] the reason that jesus was made
[1:50:06] i love that one
[1:50:08] i love that statement above all the
[1:50:10] statements i've ever made
[1:50:13] that's the reason that jesus was made
[1:50:16] to save you and me
[1:50:19] right
[1:50:20] god flesh among us god came himself to
[1:50:22] redeem his child
[1:50:24] that's why philip could say
[1:50:26] show me the father he said philip if
[1:50:27] i've been so long with you
[1:50:29] if you've seen me you've seen the father
[1:50:31] right
[1:50:32] but he couldn't comprehend it he came to
[1:50:34] redeem his own that's the reason jehovah
[1:50:36] was made flesh in his own son to die to
[1:50:39] sin that was placed upon him to redeem
[1:50:42] the sinner
[1:50:44] all right go to the next one
[1:50:47] god who is rich in mercy
[1:50:49] there it was to be an eternal atonement
[1:50:53] this was to be an eternal queen of 105
[1:50:58] because he came himself god came down in
[1:51:01] the form of sinful flesh to make a make
[1:51:03] a eternal atonement and suffered in the
[1:51:06] flesh and made the eton atonement and
[1:51:09] returned back in the form of the holy
[1:51:11] ghost to confirm that atonement
[1:51:14] all right go on to the next sorry to
[1:51:15] read facts but i want to get this done
[1:51:19] god's provided way
[1:51:21] and i can see god come to the garden
[1:51:23] himself did you notice he never sent an
[1:51:25] angel he never sent some servant he came
[1:51:28] himself and up and down the garden he
[1:51:30] went screaming
[1:51:31] adam adam where art thou
[1:51:34] you can get into the omnipresent
[1:51:36] omniscient right
[1:51:38] god manifested in the flesh god never
[1:51:40] sent a prophet or an angel
[1:51:41] he created a body in the wombs of the
[1:51:44] virgin mary and he was the son of god
[1:51:46] god left his own regions of glory and he
[1:51:49] crossed his own cast to come down and
[1:51:52] become human to dwell among us
[1:51:56] and there in the beginning
[1:51:58] when man was lost god never sent an
[1:52:01] angel he came himself and he saw and he
[1:52:04] saw through the garden and under every
[1:52:06] bush and behind until he found his lost
[1:52:09] child remember i warned you
[1:52:11] not to think that was only the creation
[1:52:14] of himself coming into flesh to be
[1:52:17] and the word was made flesh because
[1:52:19] whatever he is here he's got to have
[1:52:21] been back there okay go ahead
[1:52:25] this one is that day on calvary
[1:52:28] god had required it no man was worthy no
[1:52:30] man was able you remember the kinsmen
[1:52:32] redeemer you remember the lamb and all
[1:52:34] taking the book no man could do it and
[1:52:36] god came himself and was made human and
[1:52:39] lived a human life under human desires
[1:52:41] and was crucified at calvary and there
[1:52:43] when satan thought he wouldn't do it
[1:52:46] he wouldn't go through with it he went
[1:52:47] to gethsemane no wonder god in human
[1:52:50] flesh
[1:52:51] was dying
[1:52:54] but my god can't die
[1:52:56] now you just cut off
[1:52:59] and you'll lose every bit i said in the
[1:53:01] message
[1:53:03] brother sean so said god can't said his
[1:53:05] god couldn't die
[1:53:07] who we were so and so
[1:53:12] your prophets he said
[1:53:15] all right
[1:53:21] he was nothing less than almighty god in
[1:53:23] human flesh he came himself the word
[1:53:25] perfection to offer his blood
[1:53:28] it had to even come
[1:53:30] the way it came
[1:53:35] look what he says on this last one
[1:53:38] having conferences
[1:53:42] i guess that's the right one e19
[1:53:45] no having conferences should be the last
[1:53:47] one number
[1:53:48] 33.
[1:53:51] all right we got it
[1:53:52] there you go come on up now
[1:53:55] how that god was manifest in the flesh
[1:53:57] in jesus christ to come to the earth not
[1:53:59] trusted in the hands of an angel or some
[1:54:01] church authority but he came himself
[1:54:04] made flesh and dwelt among us hunt out
[1:54:06] his lost child god didn't take gabriel
[1:54:08] and say go down and hunt my children he
[1:54:11] came himself it was a man-sized job
[1:54:15] a god-sized job let's stand
[1:54:21] sorry to read suffice and to do it i
[1:54:23] want to get that out of the way
[1:54:25] because
[1:54:26] i want to move on
[1:54:29] but think about it
[1:54:31] what are you saying brother dale
[1:54:34] i believe that i'm saying what the
[1:54:36] prophet says
[1:54:38] and i believe what he's saying is that
[1:54:42] the great eternal
[1:54:47] had all these attributes in him
[1:54:51] and then when it comes to starting to
[1:54:52] display in it
[1:54:54] he didn't send an angel
[1:54:57] he came himself
[1:54:59] to redeem
[1:55:02] he came himself
[1:55:04] who was that on the river jordan who was
[1:55:07] that in the cradle
[1:55:08] the baby jehovah
[1:55:11] who is that on the river jordan
[1:55:17] almighty god
[1:55:20] but yet brother so-and-so says that
[1:55:22] that's when he become god
[1:55:30] that's what i'm telling you
[1:55:31] be careful what you listen to
[1:55:36] the bible said he was born to emmanuel
[1:55:39] so i'm going to take the bible
[1:55:41] you say well what happened on the river
[1:55:43] jordan right he was anointed for the
[1:55:44] ministry that he went forth exactly
[1:55:48] he could not die for our sins at two
[1:55:50] years old he could not die for our sins
[1:55:52] when he was arguing with a priest at the
[1:55:55] wall at 12 13 years old or whatever it
[1:55:57] was
[1:55:58] he couldn't die for our sins when he
[1:56:00] first started his ministry
[1:56:08] but then one day
[1:56:10] at the river jordan
[1:56:12] the anointing came on him for the
[1:56:13] ministry that he was to bring and he
[1:56:14] brought that ministry
[1:56:19] right
[1:56:21] he brought the ministry
[1:56:23] you know what happened in the garden the
[1:56:24] anointing the prophet said left him
[1:56:27] what anointing the anointing it came on
[1:56:29] him on the river jordan not the
[1:56:30] anointing not the anointing of him being
[1:56:32] god because he cried out on the cross
[1:56:35] he said into thy hands i come in my
[1:56:36] spirit
[1:56:39] it was either god died on the cross or
[1:56:41] when you and i are still in our sins
[1:56:46] but we don't want to believe it
[1:56:48] i'm sorry i missed it we're supposed to
[1:56:50] give a doing uh
[1:56:52] brother homer fraser
[1:56:54] had an accident on a tractor most of us
[1:56:56] know brother fraser he had an accident
[1:56:58] on a tractor busted up his pelvis and
[1:57:02] different things with his hips and
[1:57:04] things
[1:57:04] it was something on the thing and uh i
[1:57:07] forgot to say that to where we could
[1:57:09] pray for him but most all of us know
[1:57:11] brother fraser
[1:57:13] and he
[1:57:14] had this accident so let's pray for him
[1:57:17] that god will touch him and bring him
[1:57:18] through this
[1:57:20] he's the one you remember that fell out
[1:57:21] of the tree stand got busted up and all
[1:57:23] back a few years ago his brother ron
[1:57:25] spencer's father-in-law
[1:57:28] and so let's let's pray now before we
[1:57:31] before we do any singing okay father
[1:57:35] we're sorry we forgot about this
[1:57:38] at the beginning and our mind was so
[1:57:40] twisted and pulled and
[1:57:42] but now we were
[1:57:44] brought to our remembers that we've
[1:57:45] forgotten it and we ask you to just be
[1:57:47] with brother fraser lord and reach down
[1:57:49] and touch him and take care of all of
[1:57:51] these things that he's had and all the
[1:57:54] busting up the bones and the things
[1:57:55] because he's on up in age probably
[1:57:58] somewhere in his 80s lord and we just
[1:58:00] ask you father to touch him and to be
[1:58:03] with him father and set him free
[1:58:05] all the pain the agonies and things we
[1:58:07] love you and we thank you in jesus name
[1:58:10] amen amen
[1:58:12] what do we got let's sing this you can
[1:58:14] see
[1:58:15] let's uh two nights sorry for being just
[1:58:17] a little bit over this afternoon but i
[1:58:19] wanted to get the point
[1:58:24] and to bring out about the part of god
[1:58:30] you say but i just can't see how that
[1:58:31] part
[1:58:33] if you'll get your mind and thinking
[1:58:36] i will bless
[1:58:38] his name the father
[1:58:40] stepped over into
[1:58:43] another foreign
[1:59:01] now here's what we're going to get into
[1:59:02] so think on it
[1:59:06] brother brown said if you read the bible
[1:59:08] and don't see christ in every verse
[1:59:13] go back and read it again
[1:59:16] we got to come down through that old
[1:59:18] testament before we bring
[1:59:21] god into being upon the earth called
[1:59:23] jesus christ
[1:59:26] so we got a large journey to make
[1:59:31] but i hope it's an understanding
[1:59:46] he is
[1:59:58] his name again
[2:00:21] thank you thank you for speaking to our
[2:00:23] brother
[2:00:24] thank you lord we love you yes lord we
[2:00:27] thank you
[2:00:28] in jesus name amen
[2:00:52] you know what he has need of
[2:00:54] we believe you father
[2:00:56] what he's asking for
[2:00:58] we thank you in jesus name
[2:01:02] he is
[2:01:07] he here here
[2:01:24] and he's had a lot of problems down
[2:01:26] through time and you know different
[2:01:27] things
[2:01:28] but now he just
[2:01:31] he can't even do without medication they
[2:01:33] just about have to keep him knocked out
[2:01:35] right that's the only way to get the
[2:01:36] release the only relief they get let's
[2:01:39] believe it
[2:01:40] he helped back here build the back part
[2:01:42] of the church home
[2:01:44] back there because if it hadn't been for
[2:01:45] him we would have been really bad shape
[2:01:47] because
[2:01:48] uh the guy that was supposed to be in
[2:01:50] charge
[2:01:52] he kind of liked alcohol
[2:01:54] and he kind of got left us
[2:01:57] and he left all the cement poured out
[2:02:00] i just happened to be that my wife and i
[2:02:02] and brother and sister would be come up
[2:02:04] we were going
[2:02:05] up to the mountain to a cabin we had and
[2:02:07] here we are
[2:02:09] and we get up here and there's james
[2:02:13] hardly one arm to work with
[2:02:15] and he's trying to smooth that out well
[2:02:17] i had to get out in my good clothes and
[2:02:19] do and
[2:02:20] and help them smooth out the concrete we
[2:02:22] didn't get it exactly right but we got
[2:02:24] it close enough
[2:02:25] but he's the one that helped do this
[2:02:27] back here to the back on going that away
[2:02:29] so let's let's believe that god will
[2:02:32] take care of it all right
[2:02:34] father
[2:02:35] we send this prayer claw
[2:02:38] for james lord
[2:02:39] and you just reach down and touch him
[2:02:42] and you bring him out of all this
[2:02:44] hurting and things
[2:02:45] the problems that's going on
[2:02:48] in jesus name amen
[2:02:54] just hold a minute little deanna's
[2:02:56] coming
[2:02:57] and then we'll pray but i wanted to make
[2:02:59] an announcement but
[2:03:02] the little been sick of her stomach
[2:03:04] crying
[2:03:05] okay lord jesus her throat and her
[2:03:08] things is bothering her and her stomach
[2:03:10] lord
[2:03:11] we just commit it to you father and
[2:03:13] believe in you that by your stripes he's
[2:03:15] healed in jesus name
[2:03:18] okay
[2:03:19] amen and amen
[2:03:21] most of you know that they've been
[2:03:23] playing around with me for quite a while
[2:03:25] about
[2:03:26] an irregular heartbeat
[2:03:28] and they've done everything thanking
[2:03:30] this out of the other and they said it
[2:03:31] for this date and everybody thinks i'm
[2:03:33] going to set another date and everybody
[2:03:35] thinks i'm going but nobody knows yet
[2:03:37] until when we're going because i got to
[2:03:39] go thursday all right
[2:03:42] the doctor will determine thursday
[2:03:44] whether or not i need the shocking of
[2:03:47] the heart you know to try to put it back
[2:03:49] in rhythm
[2:03:50] all right but it'll be thursday when i
[2:03:53] go back to the doctor
[2:03:55] they do have me on the sleep machine
[2:03:58] that i'm you know piggy's not hearing me
[2:04:00] snore but she hearing
[2:04:04] all night long
[2:04:05] and can't turn over and look at me a lot
[2:04:07] of times because the air's going out and
[2:04:10] mine's not like the old ones that put it
[2:04:12] out this is because it's leaking around
[2:04:14] it i don't have it set on my head
[2:04:15] correctly but you just pray that the
[2:04:18] lord and that's what i've done i'm still
[2:04:20] believing that
[2:04:22] by the time we get to our thirsty that
[2:04:24] the doctor is going to say everything's
[2:04:25] all right
[2:04:26] now i'm believing that
[2:04:28] all right you say but brother dale what
[2:04:31] if it don't happen i'll still be
[2:04:32] believing what are you going to do
[2:04:36] i know about his stripes i'm healed i
[2:04:38] don't care what the doctor says or what
[2:04:40] they got to do to this body to bring it
[2:04:42] under subjection
[2:04:44] you know that doesn't bother me none
[2:04:46] whatsoever
[2:04:49] i'm not concerned about what you think
[2:04:51] scared because of this out of the other
[2:04:54] if it wasn't for my family in this
[2:04:56] church i'd love to be in heaven right
[2:04:57] now
[2:05:01] but if i said if it wasn't for this my
[2:05:03] family in this church i'd love to be in
[2:05:04] heaven
[2:05:06] i would you know i'd be glad to go home
[2:05:09] because i don't care
[2:05:10] the first attack that i had of any
[2:05:12] problem i sit out there for three hours
[2:05:14] outside
[2:05:16] in the deer hunt land
[2:05:18] it just rejoice it
[2:05:20] and say lord
[2:05:22] if you want me to go on here today
[2:05:26] we won't have none of that problems that
[2:05:27] they got to run here and run there just
[2:05:30] take me on but take care of the family
[2:05:32] but if you ain't through with me
[2:05:35] then just make everything all right
[2:05:38] and we'll we'll do that
[2:05:40] all right and i believe he still
[2:05:43] i believe he's going to take care of it
[2:05:44] i don't have no concern
[2:05:47] but i leave it up to him it's like i
[2:05:48] told the doctor i said listen doc
[2:05:51] i believe in your program because we
[2:05:52] believe in medical science up to a point
[2:05:54] that's what i told him i said but who do
[2:05:56] you think has taken care of me for 74
[2:05:58] years

[2:06:16] go over the other day to another doctor
[2:06:18] which is the sinus infections and
[2:06:20] different things you know
[2:06:22] and he turned around told me he said
[2:06:25] i know about all these other things you
[2:06:27] got on here and he said we just have to
[2:06:29] put them on the list well it struck me i
[2:06:31] didn't get exactly what he was meaning
[2:06:34] and he said you know what i mean we're
[2:06:35] going to talk to god
[2:06:38] it's okay

[2:08:36] baptist the presbyterian the
[2:08:38] pentecostals what did it wind up being
[2:08:41] a good thoughts and ideas
[2:08:44] but now we're down to the basis that we
[2:08:46] can look into the scriptures
[2:08:48] and see god's plan and purpose
[2:08:51] write in the scripture and then look
[2:08:53] back and see it unfolding
[2:08:56] around us
[2:08:59] right
