want to see him amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your bibles turn to hebrews 10 in ephesians 5 where was reading this morning try to get this thought in and then maybe change little channels or something of it but just pray that the lord would bless remember wade will be ministering lord willing wednesday and then remember this that sunday we will be taking communion so everything we order for all of that we'll be having a good time of doing those things remember all of these that are away today visiting and whatever they're doing ministering things is more missing today than they are here so we just uh you know wonder where they're at that's what they're doing but that's you know that's the way god does things he puts us all to the place we need to be it doesn't matter if we don't want to get there he he'll hurt us around some way and make it work out i mean all right let's just uh pray and then go into the scriptures hebrews 10 and ephesians 5. the heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for the grace and love and all the things that you've given unto us thank you for an opportunity to be able to read your word as we try to express this morning and just read a natural story read of natural things that are taking place but to see that we're part of it and see that we're part of you lord we ask you to just have your way with each one come on the scene now this afternoon and open our eyes to thy word that we may walk in the light of your graves remember the ones that are not here some six different things remember brother curran there lord her sister said he was sick remember him and just be there be with brother i o lord he so wanted to be here today because he was he i talked to him yesterday lord and he said he'd like to come so then that's a desire that's in the heart and we pray that you'd bless have your way with each and every one of us forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness lead us in your love in jesus name amen ephesians i mean hebrews 10 and then ephesians okay hebrews 10 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the thing can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make their commerce their unto perfect now that's like i said i'd like to read the word but understand what it's saying the it sounds like if you read that scripture and this is what i was trying to get across to you this morning it sounds like they're saying something in other words it can't happen but watch it doesn't make the comer there unto perfect it has to be offered over and over but each time it's offered are you listening each time it's offered it makes you perfect for the time you know that year or whatever it is they have one offer and they have to take it up and do it it works for the whole year so if you read it then see just read the way you're going because it said with those sacrifices they offered year by year continually make they're coming down to perfect it sounds like that they're just worth nothing no they're not worth it they're worth all of the total thing because it covers you for that year or then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshiper once purged should have no more conscience of sin but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins year after year you you've got to go in and offer them where it's not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats shouldn't make take could take away sin wherefore when he cometh into the world he said sacrifice an offering thou would has not but a body has thou prepared me all right sacrifice and offerings can't do it but it can cover for a time but it can't take it away but i want it to be taken away don't you okay now let's go to ephesians 5 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves unto your own husband as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even this cross also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church having not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ultimate all men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man can no man ever yet hateth his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it even as the lord of church for we are members of his body right now of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ in the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife let's see that she reverence her husband in other words what are you saying christ in the church body in christ explaining it paul's putting it down in plain language as i said you read the natural part but he's talking about christ in the church there's a mystery in the bible that you start reading in genesis and you get the natural story was you following this morning but yet see then once you get involved in it you'll start getting the fact that there's a mystery being revealed that's what we want to know about isn't it you can be seated lord add his blessing to the reading of his word and christ is that mystery all right so i i hope it seemed to be that i couldn't get my point over this morning but maybe i should have read my things but i had 30-something quotes and i gave you them and uh you know we put them on the internet a lot of times i didn't want to i had 36 i think this morning we didn't quote you know didn't take nothing read it too much read a couple little things but it goes on the internet all right people listening they can look and see that all right they can pull that quote up and and and you know and hear it they can they can be doing that so that's why we go ahead and put it on there even though we don't read it here it'll be doing it because you know that way we can get the quotes on to them okay all right now let's just get started on a thought that we were on this morning that we are the body of christ he has always had some form or what thoughts or whatever you'd want to say a body all right even back before time even back before anything he had a supernatural body all right the best i could do with it is call it maybe a theophany but that is a body and if you die you realize your body goes this way naturally but your body of what you are in the body of christ you're a child you're a christian or you know a christian that goes somewhere to dwell and wait until it's all finished so then you've got a body we've got a body that's my point my whole point was that god has never been left without a body but it goes in stages see he came forth into the world under one stage to bring it from a glorified supernatural whatever you want to call it body theophany and then he came into flesh all right to a natural 16 element body all right then one day that was offered as a sacrifice and when it was then he went beyond and took the body and all up and left it and came back himself to dwell in the church so he never left himself without a body he's always had a body because that's the point he wanted a body so why would he just go so far and then stop no huh it's going to come forth the body of christ is going to come forth and we are that body and without him the prophet said you're not complete i mean he's not complete without you let's put it that way so we are on our own but uh he's not complete all right then it has to go in stages to understand see you and i have the baptism of the holy ghost we have eternal life in our soul we are in the statute of a perfect man somewhere in the uh dwelling of that and those quotes this morning we had in there that that would be the body of christ would be a body that he would provide which would be the stature of a perfect man that's the body that god wants to live in is your nature your ways your doing that he has given to you to add to what you have and it made forth to where you would be a child of god for adoptions uh things like that so it all comes in stages okay but i think what we need to do is consider the fact that i believe we're in the end time i believe we're in the finishing up of all things i i'm not a doomsday or or something like that kind of a guy i never have beat on you about this or that or the other or or went through dates and times and seasons or anything trying to scare you because it won't do no good it won't scare nobody into doing nothing you can't scare a child into being saved so don't do that don't scare your children or try to uh make them think about god in the wrong way talk to them about the love of god sure he wants took you to live right he wants you to be corrected you can explain the things uh you know as i've always said i never whipped with children until i explained why well you know what they wound up saying hey daddy just give me the whooping let me get out of here they didn't care much about the explaining they didn't worry about the the beating because they knew i wasn't going to kill them you know so they you know they but they'd say well just give me the whip and let me get out of here well that's that's all right now but see he's always had a bodily form but yet it moved from one thing to another one place one conditions existence and what to another until it wound up in two on the day of pentecost into the bride of jesus christ all right now for for 2 000 the prophet said every age every time has had its own portion of the word the things to be brought forth and that mainly is what we want to think about because what i was driving at this morning maybe not enough for you to understand the way i talk but see that body is being built by the word you become the word as you receive the word all right see your glorified body is being built the prophet said around your born-again experience well why don't you want a glorified body let's get born again and let it get started just go down the road that way go the way he says for us to go and it'll all work out we try to figure it out and we'll get it messed up every time you know so we just do what the prophet said and that's what i love about it to where you can read the prophet's message and it's so wonderful until there is a even as i'm trying to explain this morning that he can explain a situation of natural and you can sit there and let god deal in your mean your your mental faculties and things and come out with with the point of looking at god and seeing something that he's making known to you all right and then see that brings us to that position all right now he getting my get my statement he's never been without a body okay we saw that so we got that he had back there before the world we could call it theophany and call it glorified you can call it but he had a body he wasn't just a wind floating around just air and just puffing it see no see that's our denominational ideas okay see god is real he was real back there all right so then he kept coming down until he could come to the body of christ you know the lord jesus himself in human flesh upon this earth god in human flesh that body was the body of god not that it made him a second person or a third person or some kind of something it didn't make him that it all it done was brought into manifestation those things that he was so he always was let me put it and i won't use the word human but let me put it this way he was a being the prophet said he said he's not like the wind so god is a being so if we could ever start comprehending about how real he is then he's just not the figurative of your imagination or some thought or some idea you know i've heard people try to explain the godhead and they'd say you know well god is this or god is that no no no you start leaving out and put nowhere extra in you're going to wind up in trouble so just be normal like it is let it go and just just serve god okay now watch god then came into human flesh and he's been in the human flesh for now for the 2000 years all right so he is not complete without you he said no no he can do what he wants to no he's not complete without you he's done it that way he designed it that way he made it that way to where that you and i would be involved in the form of salvation and you know existing on earth and what to do the all right then when he stepped over into the bride on the day of pentecost he's headed toward what he started out as being he started out as being a supernatural being now he's come to live in you and i to redeem these bodies that we live in all right redeeming the body making it to where that it can be used and see then he can't be complete without us but we're naturally we know that we're not in no way complete without him salvation is of the lord it's not you and me me all right see because then that way if he's if he if we can if we can study the word and see what he is today then what he was is wonderful that's that's all right that's i like that that's what i was trying to explain about the bible that i can read the bible now and i can just just just turn just read it and you know they they was building buildings back there they was doing all kind of things and you know all kinds of things was in manifestation you can sit there and think about those things all right but then you see the spiritual part of it when it comes forth in you see that he's building that in you because he didn't want to dwell in buildings that was never god's plan to have any kind of a fancy looking building or anything he didn't want that he brought that into being and used it because he used the tent the tabernacles and things he done those things yeah that's all right but that was not his plan his plan was to come down become mankind all right redeem the man make the man what he is and then one day change the whole thing because what did he do he came down he was god in in soul he was god in in spirit all right his body was a human body so that's where we're at that's what i was trying to get your emphasis to you for you to think about they're stood adam that's wonderful to me there stood adam and eve in the garden a body that would would you know finally do wrong and things but a soul and spirit to where that soul that was in them could be eternal and god looked at that and said that's what they are that's what i want to do remember how i was expressing it here a few weeks ago see adam came before the lord jesus did right adam came body spirit and soul and he came to the point of eternal life in his soul so thereby he could not be destroyed he was what god wanted for the time he was going to use that to bring forth the rest of his plan he was planning on coming to earth just like that man was and he did he came in body and spirit burst into a or brought forth you know whatever you want to call it begotten a body to live in all right and he lived in that all the years with mankind and and everything then one day he realized well i've got to give this body up now it's going to be bad he and i think i think the lord jesus enjoyed being a human now maybe you don't but i enjoy life i do i enjoy life i i never have fuss to drive into doorville that start with we were driving like 75 miles and took you two hours and a half to get there and that was every day and that to come back home because we had to go down through doorville and all across country there weren't no expressways but i never i never griped and complained about working i'd get off every time i could sure and they was nice enough a lot of times to let me off and to do you know because they knew that i would be there to work the rest of the time and out of 27 and a half years i was five minutes late one time so that order figured it i probably wanted to go to work you know all right but you see the thing that i didn't like was having to put up with mankind that was the part i didn't like as far as the work i never bothered me about working and all but it bothered me about the people around me you know and it was hard to get along with them sometimes and some sometimes it just it was fun you know to do but now listen so then if we come to the position now we've come through what he was to what he is you know or what he turned into being and what he is is and then what he is now all right we find he's here now in bodily form which is the bride right so without the bodily form look where you'd be now you're getting why the prophet would say it he said god is not complete without you well that that used to that hey it hit that old uh cranium cap up there with me and it just bounced around and and this you know i i just couldn't see it and one day it dawned on me just what i'm talking about now if he didn't have a body to live in he'd have to come back some way and do something so he came in bright form that's where he's at now and he's having a good time and i'm having a good time out of it you know i mean the basics of what i'll be going through this afternoon if i get there i preached this in athens georgia in 1969. that the bride of jesus christ would be the son of man the lord jesus christ the fullness of the godhead bodily in a people in 1969. so i've enjoyed it i can look back and think about that and remember those days and the things that i i did try to preach well you're just trying to be sorry well it happened what's your problem i mean you want to be sarcastic go ahead and call me that i don't care i've had a good time the this coming into the the the message it was not a bad thing for me you know a lot of people said well man i had trouble when i come into mexico because i was doing this and i was doing that you know and i i i had to quit this and i had to quit that and well i smoked a little bit when i was a kid most the time was rabbit tobacco a lot of you wouldn't know anything about those things but you know very little smoking no drinking probably yeah human being yeah okay same but i enjoyed living then a life as a human element not knowing that he would eventually come to me to try to get me to come back to where i should be in him go out and do wrong come home and sit there and think well what in the world did i do that for that wasn't right and i wasn't even a christian joined the baptist church when i was 18 years old my wife and i were married and she was going to church and i'd been in church all of my life you know up and down so i said well i'll just go on with her so we went to you know the church i was 18 years old all right but i've enjoyed my life what i'm trying to get you to see is i believe god has enjoyed the point of a people living up on this earth that could live without having to be a garbage can some people tell you about the things a message took away i didn't have them i didn't drink i didn't do those things i thought you ought to be a christian we didn't have to get up on sunday morning are we going to church today there was never a thought it was never a thought never been a thought when we go on vacation we go to church we make some arrangements some way to be in a church well i was doing that in the baptist church i didn't have to quit doing this and quit doing that to come in this message my point i don't believe god was happy with us when we do wrong well when we try to do right i think he thinks that's my child i could spend a while on adoption in the statue of perfect man and a few things like that to try to understand that point right but i think you ought to understand all right see i think he has enjoyed the fact of living because the bible said it said about him and said you know that it plea he pleased god well i think he's pleased to dwell in you or he wouldn't be there it ain't a forceful thing that he's got to do it you know i think he enjoys living in his people i think he like brother branham would say about adam and eve he said god would come down in the day and you know at the end of the day and say my children said have you had a good time today yeah we've just we've had some good he's okay come we'll just lay down here and take a l little night you know a nice nap and wake up in the morning ready to go he was happy don't you think he's more happier with you than he was with adam and eve because adam and eve sure they had eternal life in their soul but but the point was they were not born again christians they were not per se or have they used that word fancy one time they were not the children of god as a born-again christian that had never come into existence but see when he came into existence 2 000 years ago then how much more happier is he today than he was when he started the worst that we could do he takes and makes it the greatest and comes down and dwells with his people satisfied to dwell well i i don't know whether he wants i think you order sometimes lay down in in the quietness of the night or sometimes just start praying and just start walking or something just this why i love to hunt i i've hunted a lot of days when my gun would be like the drums i didn't have it sitting next to me i was having me a good time took my little thing that brother richard and joe and him made for me and all the tapes was on it i just put that in my pocket i could sit back on that deer stand just click that thing on and just rotate through three tapes while i was because they're gonna be sitting there for four hours you know having a good time looking around and see the squirrels and see them just playing and everything i was in some big old timber one time you know what we call virgin timber great big tall trees and i was watching this squirrel and he come running down through there and jumped up on the tree next to me and he goes up that tree and that thing man i was in there just going and it was 50 foot high it was an inch and that squirrel went up the side of that tree all the way to the top and i sat now looking like that i lied i said well you made it up now you're gonna have to come back down he went out on a limb and he's just sprung off that limb right out in midair and he comes sailing and landed on a tree right next to me and it's just like he had done that many times before maybe because he just hit that tree and it just bounced like it and he just went on i sat there and cried i said god i wish i could trust you like that i think god wants to dwell with his people in the best well let me put it this way i think he would dwell will dwell with us and be with us in the worst that we are we won't even deal with the best we can be because that don't being best don't make you nothing with god i found that out a long time ago it's not what we do like that that works it's our repentant heart that he looks at and things that more of anything else all right now thinking about it so let me get on see god wanted to live with a man and the bride now is his body her soul is redeemed page 49 future home waiting the redemption of the body all right waiting to a time that he can change these bodies and take us into glory okay so he's not going to change and get a new body i loved that when i heard the prophet when he first explained it because see we used to think was going to get a new one i mean that was after the message i still hear that in the people of this message some you know especially years ago when you used to go to a lot of the meetings you could still hear preachers and you'd say hey that guy believes in getting him a new body and they just literally come out and say it i'm going to get me a new body well i remember when them old baptist preachers said i'm going to get me a new body it don't matter about me smoking i'm gonna throw this in the way well i think well is that the way they think you know is that the way people think it now man but listen see then if we can realize who we are is that the way the prophet said it when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for said she'll be an invincible army all right now in doing that let's just think about let's start the message now okay i got this wrote down where uh today's valentine's day to all you ladies you know happy valentine's day uh i i kind of thought about i thought well you know that's really something for me to be preaching about the bride of jesus christ on a on valentine's day because that was his desire his points was to live with a with a wife all right now you've seen what we were talking about in the message this morning so let's get started we'll start reading okay we're talking about this morning how that jesus was the body that god come and dwelt in all right we saw that god didn't want to live in buildings made by hand he wanted to live in the body and that was in the body of jesus christ because he would be the perfect son all right because god has always had a body to live in whether you want to go back before the world where you want to go anywhere he's always had a body and he's got a body now and that body now is the bride of jesus christ all right now we get down to the day that we're living now i want to read in reverse on one so brother uh anderson pull up number 20. uh that'll be the last quote i didn't give them a thing they didn't have to run anything this morning they just set their resting let's go to number 20 which is god's only provided place of worship they don't okay and listen to what he's saying the lutherans under justification defeat raised it like that wesley under sanctification of pentecost under the arms the works and the deeds and so forth had to be a cowardice or had to be a armenian had to be legalists but now we come to the pit come to the head the capstone grace grace the capstone cried the headstone crying what grace grace look past from death and creed into a living word of the living god now that's what god sees of us he sees it of somebody because that's what the prophet said pastor and death and god's only provided plan for his age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit sparked it and lit off something to make it alive and sent and seated now in heavenly places now watch him you being a part of god's gene a part of the word other men are part of god's word seated together manifest the entire body of christ because there's no leaven among you all right now somebody's coming to that so we can do what we want to see what the see what he's talking about brother brown no no leaven among you just the word only seated in heavenly places in the door watch now where he put his name christ jesus no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you okay now we'll get you off the hook we don't if we don't think we can ever come to that place we don't have to worry about it we ain't going to be there we're going to go by the grave i'm talking to christian today i'm talking to sinners i'm talking to people that are not saved i'm talking to people looking at people that are christians that's why the lord showed me about 40 years ago and i've told you about it that he showed me the biggest portion of people of this message was going to die and go by the grave because they would not be able to reach the a the point to where that they could take the change they would not settle down into the word and take the word for what it's saying and do it now i can't help it if something told me that i've told you that probably 50 75 or 100 times over the 40 years so you ought to believe that something happened well i ain't telling what i'm just saying what it is because look no loving among you what's living sin no sin among you you have a brother there will never be then you're going by the grave if you say you can't come to a place that you can't live a life without having sin then you're contrary to the word of god so listen now living among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you watch him that he explains it so listen to what he's saying he's going to tell you how it's done because he's going to tell you why it can't be done or couldn't be done until this age look at it no living among you too that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you couldn't do it in luther's age luther couldn't say he didn't have any leaven come on couldn't do it and luther's life couldn't do it in wesley's age watch him this is the one that's hard shaking couldn't do it in the pentecostal age you mean brother dale that those people are not no he's not saying those people ain't going he's saying they couldn't come to a change a change of the body couldn't come down through those ages no word oh yeah a little hearing little liar little things happening right god living among them but look i couldn't do it in the pentecostal delays but in the day when the son of man will be manifested okay what's got to happen the son of man's got to be manifested is that the reading am i in english reading and what it says am i taking what i've tried to explain this morning of the bible that you can read there and this half of that happened that's happened that you said one that was in the natural then to flop over and you can see at the same time and all those things in the natural here come god right down through in genesis two and one you know making man and two and coming forth and then three where is it at the seat of the woman right and look so it couldn't do it in the pentecostal age couldn't do any western days couldn't do it in luther's day why there was no promise in those ages that the son of man would come to the earth again all right in the day when the son of man will be manifested reveal brought back the church together with the entire deity of god amongst his people showing the same visible signs manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifested on earth in the form of a prophet or o glory promised by malachi 4 promised by the rest of the scriptures what where are you worshiping at the house of god now listen now let me say something to her i try to explain things and maybe i shouldn't brother would be i remember that he said you'll find out when these days you can't do what you do that's what he said you're trying to explain it he said you can't explain it i said well might not be able to explain it but i sure don't want to leave it in a dumb situation it can't be understood is that plain enough to you i know i can't explain this message but i've tried my best to at least get us out of the dumb situation that most people exist in if you want your feelings hurt go ahead about i'm not trying to win nothing that way i'm just trying to tell you the truth what is the prophet saying he said he could not luther's age had sin go to your church ages we're on that and listening to some of it now go to those church ages and look and get the names and the things like uh you know which one is it i know i remember one of them uh which one was it were columba yeah temperance fourth church eight you come into those situations until it was pitiful you had a few people trying to survive rest was running after the catholic church he couldn't do it in west luthor's age he couldn't do it in wesley's age he said well the pentecostal had he said you couldn't do it in the pentecost the pentecostal age couldn't come to the chains of the body and if you can't come to the chains of the body what is the need of talking about a body well see i'm putting it the best that i can to where i try to prove it there's no age back there i had the son of man now he's the one that put it is it not the truth of knowing the son of man now we're talking about for a minute we'll talk on the level of natural things we read in the book natural things are reading the book you realize that there's no way in the world we could make it without this prophet's message the prophet and the message now that's as simple as i can make it to make you know that i'm not dependent upon samuel dale wade dale or anybody else to try to bring something to get us changed we've already got the message and when i read about the son of man i don't read out brother branham i read it in there what that son of man was supposed to be and do because without him bringing the message where would we be see it couldn't be done in luther's age there wasn't enough word couldn't be done in wesley's age couldn't be done in the in the pentecostal age he said well brother no he didn't come into pentecostal age he's not the messenger of the pentecostal he's the malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 you get them all together you'll come out of the out of lady osea into the bright age which is not an additional age all right so now think about it it has to be in this age that the son of man would have to come back in this age or time wherever you want to put it because i've said it there it ain't no age then i say they're real cause you can't be we're in an age we're in time until lady osea finishes and lady osea finishes when you enter the millennium and the millennium is still time because it's a thousand years so then get all that off your mind and try to you say i'm trying to figure out what you're talking about don't just take what i say and just think about it now watch then the bride of jesus christ would be the body and it would come up through the ages luther was a part of the body of christ wesley was a part of pentecostals was a part of the body of christ we're not taking those people out and throwing them away they were a part of the breath but there was not a manifestation of the son of man that would have to wait until the prophet came on the scene and he plainly told us i am not the son of man is that the way he said it he said he's the son of man he was the one to introduce like john was not the lord jesus christ but he was the one to stand on the scene to make known the lord jesus or reveal him all right now the body of christ the bride of christ see if we can come over into this with us and see it realize that we can move up a step or two from a point that we've established the point is what luther wesley pentecost couldn't do it so there had to be something take place so that was the mani coming of the malachi 4 the son of man all right all right we got that settled to where we can talk about it okay and in doing that then we can see that there is a possibility i like to say it that way there's a possibility of coming to a change of the body why because we have the message of malachi 4. as wade was quoting what the rapture lays in these tyson books it's in this message we ain't looking somewhere else i ain't looking for brother so-and-so to jump up and boy get this to go and you know i see people do that and i think well i'll see you on the way back you know how you keep up with the joneses you ever heard that one you know you just keep up with the joneses you know how to keep up with jones's stand still why because they're going to be back oh they're going to run out there they're coming back just stand still wait on them keep up with the joneses so what about just doing that with a message and just stay with the message and do it all right let's read a couple of scriptures and get our thought from there and go on go ahead brothers now to number one which is colossians 1 17. let's just hit these things and i'll try not to be too long i'll cut it if i have to i'll put it in later i always got preached all right you got it colossians now and he is before all things and by him all things consist amen right who is that the lord jesus christ watch me the son of man i hope we get time when we're done i'll put another message you realize the only way he can be a father is to be the son of man that's what brother ronald said what do you mean well it's the father he wanted to be okay you think on that for a while watch him and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell in him all fullness dwells all right let's just read a little bit more go ahead to the next one which is colossians 2 9-10 for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily in that odd you never thought about that you don't never just sit down and think well why did it say bodily because it's going to be in the body right he said bodily because it's going to be in the body is that sensible for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily now watch it and ye are complete in him so if he's the fullness of the godhead bodily where are you at by being in the bride of jesus christ is the body listen and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power all right can i translate this with what the prophet says is in here somewhere it says he's not complete without you you know he chose it that away brother ray we didn't have anything to do with that did we you say oh i prayed i cried yeah the bible says no man sought god now the bible is not saying and neither is the prophet not saying that you didn't cry in search and fast and do it's just saying simply you couldn't do it right it has to be what he does the bible says the goodness of god is what lead us to repentance okay now go ahead to the next one i like this one oh paul he without having him a good time one day going around look and he runs up on this great big place and sees all that's going on and he'll fall smart paul said i'll i'll take this and i'll trap them in their own words and that's what he done well listen acts 17 28-30 for in him we move we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said we are also his offspring he tricked him right into the point said you guys have been talking about this unknown god and i want to talk to you about him and says you went through every bit of this and said you even admit that you think you were a child of this god you just don't know who he is but let me talk to you about it or as much then as we are the offspring now look what he says he trapped him he nailed her hide to where they couldn't answer back also of your own poison said for we are all we are also his offspring somebody sitting there saying i i don't know about he says for as much then as we are the offspring of god you admitted it that that god has got children right for as much then as we are the offspring of god we are not to think of the godhead is likened to gold or silver or stone craven by art and man's devices why would you ever want to try to put up an image to a unknown god or a known god try to make an image to it you can't he says we don't do that we don't want to put the godhead in any position of thinking about it that it's pretty gold look at it look at that statue we've got look at that image we've made i get kind of tickled thinking about uh moses when he went up on the mountain and he come back down and and they was trying to tell him that they just took this gold and they just got it real hot and throwed it up in the air and it just fell back down and there's a calf boy i wouldn't want to follow them guys for as much then as we are the offspring of god we are not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stoned graven by art and man's devices and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men ever were to repent what about it what would a godhead be likened unto if it's not likened unto gold and silver in other words if you were going to make an image to your god what would you do you were going to make an image to your god in other words thinking what he looked like what would you do well i'd i'd not make him he'd he'd be a 30 year old man and he'd have wavy hair and he'd no no but you know what i like you may not like the way i approach the thing that's okay but you know what i like i like the fact of what our prophet has done he said i've seen him two or three times now that's a direct quote if you i've seen him two or three times and he said the best that i could see of him is hoffman's head of christ at 33. well you know what i ain't trying to make no image or do nothing but i do think one thing we got pictures downstairs that are people that have passed away here and there they're like 18 20 years of age because i want to see what they look like when they come forth in the resurrection well now you try to describe me as to seeing jesus and you know and you try to make it has to be the prophet the best he could do would make it hoffman's but now he didn't say that that's the way it totally looked but he said it was the best of his understanding of side of what he said i've seen him to it two two or three times maybe three times i forgot which way the statement is okay well see we don't want to make no images out of him i was told when i first came in the message what we need to do is we need to get before the preacher of brother branham and draw and get before that and pray was you ever told that well i had just come away from the fact of the people back there thinking about jesus and i didn't want to try to get down before i never have been wanted wanted to get before a picture if i got to have a picture to remind me who god is and what's going on i'm in bad shape but yet we do know and the thing that we we can see i don't i agree with the point that we can say that that's probably what he'll look like because i believe when we get there that you're not going to see a father over here and a son over here and a holy ghost over here you're going to see the lord jesus christ i believe that amen he said we will have a body like unto his glorious body well he ain't going to be all twisted but there's one thing he'll have he'll have nail prints in here because that's still in the word think on these things i don't know what you're getting to all right let's start reading a little bit go ahead to number four let's pick up a few of these and just read some he's talking about this coming down to an age that had got in such a mess all right 46 yeah what you notice here he said at the end of the ending of the church eight it had got in such a mess till he would be revealed again as son of man when the son of man is being revealed how appropriate was that mix-up yesterday and i hope you don't miss it okay what come on not where we can see god manifested himself there as sodom as a prophet being a man in the flesh god elohim as i heard someone speak of it a while ago which the godhead bodily was in him he was the fullness elohim is the fullness of the godhead bodily now if he's the fullness if we can take like we did this morning we took if you listen we took where it says the body thou hast prepared me we applied that to the lord jesus christ and the bringing forth of the body of jesus christ upon the earth and then we switched it over to the bride of jesus christ that the bride of jesus christ has become the body of the lord jesus christ on earth and the only body that god has on earth at this time and the only body that'll be on this earth until we come to the change because we meet him in the air all right now we come to talking about this one that we talk about the lord jesus christ that he is the son of man now from here on for a while you're going to hear statements made that you're going to look at and wonder if brother branham had something to do with some of these things and i agree he did god used the man to bring the message the gifts and the things were there worked and done like that and and i'm honest to say it would be hard to have set there with him without looking at him in the wrong way i agree because i mean like he'd say he wasn't the brother wood you know if a man can tell you about the fish you're going to catch once they catches them you know well that's you know you just think about it if you stay there with him day in and day out and he just tell you every little thing i'd get worried get pretty nervous but you got to remember to keep separated the man from the gift that was within him and i ain't going to get it today but we will later to try to see how that the bible's in the writing of the bible brother brown says i know three times that the lord jesus looked like had a dual personality he said one time he would talk one time the father would talk now there's one in here where brother brandon done a marvelous job because he took us and he says now he's explaining you know how that one time jesus speak one time the father and he said like you are he said you go to work and he said that was what that's what gets me of the message of the man the way he could explain it did you go to work and said you're one personality you know one thing dealing because you're working he said then you come back to church or come home and see then you're dealing in another part how wonderful that can be explained to us that god so much has made himself manifest among us until we can see him let's read a couple then real quick okay go ahead to number five because i'll hold the point try to of the fact that be in him the lord jesus be in the fullness of the godhead bodily and then we'll break off and i'll do it on another message in order to talk about you and me and in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily all powers in heavens and earth is given unto my hands read that for yourself all powers in heaven and earth is given unto my hands he said all the power then god is powerless if he's another person how man could talk ain't none of us can do nothing like that don't worry about it we ain't going to you can't talk that language that's exactly what i was saying this morning where you look over here in genesis 1 and you see what was written the things that literally took place and then you go to genesis 2 and you see a spiritual application or something think about what he's saying all powers in heavens and earth is given in unto my hands he said all the power then god is powerless if he's another person for the bible said jesus said after his resurrection that all the power in heaven and earth both was given into my hands think about it think about how simple go ahead to the next one number six in him remember and dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily in him never dwelt just a part of god but all of god was in his son christ jesus he was the fullness of the godhead bodily all of god was poured out in christ all that god was in was was in christ all that christ is he poured out on the church but you keep refusing it why did he say that brother branham what are you getting now you say you were refusing it are we refusing to accept the things that he has said we are if he says we are the fullness of the godhead bodily and without us he's not complete so then he can't be the fullness of the godhead bodily without you is he saying that we're turning it down that's the only thing i can read said we keep refusing it refusing what refusing to believe what we are and what we're doing and what he's doing and what he's doing oh brother dale i believe it well like i said a while ago we didn't lay out a church we don't lay out a church now the church is first number one then we go on our vacations and our doings it's always been that way the kids didn't get up and say well we don't want to go to church today nobody's ever said anything about it we're just there could that be the way he's saying we refused it okay go ahead to number seven christ is a mystery of god reveal god expressed in jesus christ who was both father son and holy ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in the catholic church brother tell anybody see the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminence all that god was he poured into christ and all christ was he poured into the church the believers now how many times i didn't run it up to see but i wonder how many times did brother branham explain that one little point all god was he poured into christ all christ into the church take her back to the garden of eden or whatever many different wordings on the end how many times do you say that almost every message right but yet do we believe that we could be that huh let's reread that and again i want to read it number seven is that number seven okay god expressed in jesus christ who was both father son and holy ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminence all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into the church to believers what about could it be that we're turning down what god has said about us he tried to hammer up something line up and get belts out and whoop each other to try to get places you know lined up and get us to straighten out in the word and he never done that yet but are we accepting what god says about us i just don't see how that could have what's that got to do with it who are you do you mean i'm me well why would you think like that that's you're not god oh you hurt my feelings well i'm sorry i guess i'll keep on hurting things because that's the way i've always felt i feel that we in 1969 and i preached that the bride of jesus christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily the son of man i wish i could have had to keep it but that don't make no difference well you wouldn't believe it if you sit and listen to it if you're not going to believe it now but you see i just happen to believe it i believe god has a way now upon earth in a group of people we'll continue to read more this but just hold on if wade gave them out i made about uh 20 x or 20 something extra copies and you if you want to read about what the prophet says take them home read them where he says the bride is the fullness of the godhead bodily couldn't do it in the days of luther couldn't do it in the days of wesley right couldn't do it in pentecost but it could be done today why because the son of man is here the lord jesus christ himself is here in the form of his bride believing the word but i i i just i look around i just don't see it nowhere well maybe you order let your nose down just a little bit and get it on level ground instead of way up in the air to think that you're something bring it down to think about all of us if there's anything in this building spiritually speaking that's worth anything it's the lord jesus christ it is not me and you it is not brother branham he brought the message but he done his work and went home he'll have a great reward when we get there with him because we'll all be there with him wonderful but yet somebody has got to accept the word and believe it that's why i mention it again people was laughing back there when the lady run for the president's job or vice president what she done clinton and everybody couldn't think about nothing else brother run said and they'd just start laughing about well she couldn't that couldn't be her cause she ain't pretty i've never done that because i know brother brown wasn't talking about that kind of beauty ugliness or beauty he was talking about the controls and the doings of what they could do but now since it's come to the basis that the woman's in the white house do you hear the ministers of this message saying look at our we're in the end we're in the end because we're seeing the natural things that the prophet spoke of seeing him made manifest he said in the last few hours of the time back there with the lord jesus right before the crucifixion he said the biggest portion of the scripture was fulfilled could it be that way what are you looking for your prophet said that we'd be at the mercy of the elements but the bride don't go through the tribulation so there must be a pre-tribulation going to strike and i believe we're in it and right now all they got to do is call it in and you don't have no money wouldn't that be a horrible thing ain't going to get mine don't start that foolishness you're the first one to come after they say we're going to do the best we can do well because we're not going to be in the tribulation no huh no there's no such thing as putting the bride in the tribulation but there's a pre-tribulation to strike that ought to divide that point that the prophet said that the bride don't go through the tribulation then he comes over here and says but we'll be at the mercy of the elements he evidently saw some things that was going to get pretty bad if they can tell you you can't do this and you can't do that take your kids out of school close down companies this building everything if they can do that don't think they can't demand a lot of other things but would that have to be the tribulation that's what i asked the people years ago i said what if california goes under and we're still here well that mean we wouldn't bribe we missed it i said boy that's how much you understand i said get in your bible and you'll find out there's two earthquakes there's an earthquake at the resurrection of the saints but then there's an earthquake under the sixth seal right see it's not sitting down and simply taking it easy and studying the message and just see what the prophet has to say about this thing we get it all figured out we can't do this can't do that no just say it real simple we'll do the best we can do we'll make it the real point is of whether or not we are the bride of jesus christ you mean if i miss it does that mean that there is no god no not quite come on musicians just think on these things jesus christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily brother branham over and over and over said all god was which would be the fullness of the godhead bodily was poured into christ which would be the fullness of the godhead bodily which was poured into the church which would be the fullness of the godhead bodily how much more do we need to think on these things remember it's not what we think about ourselves at mouths it's what he is understand back on these things brother dale you you you talk about like sometimes that we're we can be in this and we can be in that i'm just telling you what the prophet said when it takes place is up to god but i don't want to be left here i want to be ready to go i don't want no trouble at the river as the old man said what we got brother let's see this old world can never hold me [Music] anymore [Music] and i have the wedding [Music] amen oh this old world can never hold me think about him look what it is [Music] see maybe you never went through a lot like me when brother reynolds started talking he said you better leave them baptist alone he said they'll tie you up i remember in the baptist church when they were preaching about the sixth seal tribulation and reading it out of the scripture and uh uh and calling at the sixth seal tribulation would be the tribulation coming because they had seven years of it but that's still [Music] what about us the happiest people in the world [Music] he's making us ready against the day that we're living this [Music] setting us in the words [Music] just pray about it pray about what the day that we're living and lord make me ready [Music] just make me ready against the today garment on this old world [Music] anymore [Music] [Music] [Applause] never pray one for another the lord would be with us all remember wade will be ministering lord willing wednesday remember next weekend we'll be taking the communion starting that getting trying to get back on the line with some of those things and all that we can be in talking about getting the sunday school set to where we can have our sunday schools and things and and do things and you know get back to operating as a a full church because we want to operate that away god take care of us i've never been afraid of anything that he told me to do many of you have been here when i'll come out here and tell you and just say well okay now this is what it's going to be when i tell you that they don't need you trying to talk me out of it because it won't work because i don't talk to him and he doesn't told me what to do and see then that way then we work on that basis and we just hold it to that of saying okay all is well father we thank you for this day and for what we've had of the message of the hour lord and the things that we've tried our best to express to the people of your love and understanding that you've given unto each one of us forgive our sins let us all walk in the light of your grace lord be led by thy understanding hands guide each and every one take care of the people on the way home give us all in your loving grace in jesus name amen you're dismissed sweep over my soul [Music] sweep over you
