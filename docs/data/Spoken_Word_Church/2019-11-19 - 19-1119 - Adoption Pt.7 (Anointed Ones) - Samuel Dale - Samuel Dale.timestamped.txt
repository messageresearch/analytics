[17:01] [Music]
[17:02] visions one paul an apostle of Jesus
[17:08] Christ by the will of God to the Saints
[17:10] which are at Ephesus and to the faithful
[17:13] in Christ Jesus grace be to you and
[17:15] peace from our Father and from the Lord
[17:18] from God our Father and from the Lord
[17:23] Jesus Christ this would be the God and
[17:25] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[17:29] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[17:30] in heavenly places in Christ according
[17:34] as he have chosen us in him before the
[17:37] foundation of the world that we should
[17:39] be holding without blame before him in
[17:41] love having predestinated us unto the
[17:46] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[17:48] himself according to the good pleasure
[17:50] of his will to the praise of the glory
[17:54] of His grace wherein he hath made us
[17:56] accepted in the blood in whom we have
[17:59] redemption through the
[18:01] his blood the forgiveness of sins
[18:03] according to the riches of His grace
[18:06] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[18:09] all wisdom and prudence having made
[18:12] known unto us the mystery of his will
[18:14] now what is the mystery of God's will to
[18:17] adopt his church all right the Prophet
[18:21] said that great glorious stand okay
[18:24] having made known unto us the mystery of
[18:26] his will according to his good pleasure
[18:28] which he had purposed in himself well
[18:31] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[18:33] of times he might gather together in one
[18:35] all things in Christ both which are in
[18:37] heaven and which are on earth even in
[18:40] him in whom also we have obtained an
[18:42] inheritance being predestinated
[18:45] according to the purpose of him who
[18:47] worketh all things after the counsel of
[18:51] his own will now watch being
[18:52] predestinated according to this purpose
[18:55] okay so that's what we want to dwell a
[18:58] little bit on tonight who worketh all
[19:01] things after the counsel of his own will
[19:03] that we should be to the praise of his
[19:05] glory who first trusted in Christ in
[19:08] whom you also trusted after that ye
[19:11] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[19:13] your salvation in whom also after you
[19:16] believed you were sealed with that holy
[19:20] spirit of promise which is the earnest
[19:24] of our inheritance unto the redemption
[19:27] of the purchased possession you may be
[19:29] seated the Lord that is blessing to the
[19:32] reading of the word now I'm gonna go
[19:33] ahead and say it but I'm not going to
[19:35] come up to it very far because I'm gonna
[19:38] try to get into a place now he says
[19:43] whereby you're sealed unto
[19:53] that holy spirit of promise that when it
[19:57] states it like that its meaning using
[19:59] that word fat the hae is singular off
[20:02] and and dwelling in the way that he
[20:05] wants it to be said but now here's the
[20:09] point that we if we have time we'll get
[20:11] there if you don't we'll take it up
[20:13] later had you ever thought about
[20:15] anointed ones what do you think about
[20:19] anointed ones
[20:27] we said well we know the Prophet taught
[20:30] us and we believe it that you're noted
[20:32] on your spirit and your no need one well
[20:40] have you ever thought about that
[20:41] everybody this in any way is anointed
[20:53] then you better cherish the way it is
[20:55] because the anointing on you is no
[20:58] different than the anointing on anointed
[21:01] ones it's not you have something certain
[21:08] anointing and then anointed one have a
[21:09] certain anointing mm-hmm now you need to
[21:14] consider that and can and pound it in
[21:16] your mind for you know till the next
[21:19] time we're back preaching we'll try to
[21:21] get in two anointed ones and explain it
[21:23] you know because here is the point
[21:29] what's the difference between anointed
[21:33] ones and true born-again Christians
[21:43] and leaving a couple of things for you
[21:46] to think on a little to consider the
[21:51] point I'll give you the answer to where
[21:54] you won't be life left dangling anointed
[22:00] ones are not sealed by the Holy Spirit
[22:14] I'll let you think on that a little bit
[22:16] anointed ones are not sealed by the Holy
[22:19] Spirit it's just on their spirit and we
[22:25] get back to that we'll get into the
[22:27] message right because what we want to
[22:29] keep in our thought is what is we read
[22:32] here in the scripture that you're
[22:33] predestinated unto adoption all right
[22:40] then being predestinated to adoption is
[22:44] a great thing as I tried to explain to
[22:46] you went back over the services couple
[22:48] of times thinking about the way to
[22:51] express it but see I was I'm trying to
[22:56] explain a point predestination is by
[23:01] foreknowledge all right those who did he
[23:07] foreknew he did predestinate well that
[23:11] does that system old denominational
[23:13] ideas about predestination we've got the
[23:17] truth now well okay explain to me why
[23:20] anointed ones are not annoying or not
[23:23] sealed by the Holy Spirit you explain
[23:26] that to me we don't have to worry about
[23:28] it these those thoughts jangling in your
[23:32] mind but see predestinated
[23:37] everybody is predestinated by for
[23:44] knowledge
[23:47] everything is predestinated by for
[23:49] knowledge the car you drove up here
[23:52] today in is predestinated you know
[23:57] everything is predestinated by for
[24:00] knowledge cause God foreknew now are you
[24:04] gonna say he didn't know now you're
[24:07] limiting God to say that God didn't know
[24:10] you know what you're doing like I told
[24:12] you about my dad and my mother's trying
[24:14] to explain predestination and she said
[24:17] God knows everything he said God no I
[24:19] won't pick up ball of cotton cut it up
[24:21] picking cotton on the field
[24:22] she said yes he does he just went around
[24:24] it went on picking cotton he thought
[24:27] he'd really had her boobs you know but
[24:30] he did have a point to her that she
[24:32] couldn't explain it but see his point
[24:35] was if God predestinated me to do that
[24:37] then I got to do that huh but the
[24:40] predestination is a great depth of
[24:42] understanding once you get it into the
[24:45] right order it'll come out to a
[24:46] wonderful point but remember it's all
[24:49] got to be related to predestination by
[24:53] foreknowledge right
[24:58] that God foreknew what we would do all
[25:01] right now the Prophet says 154 Church
[25:06] age book we've quoted it over and over
[25:08] to you that it's not the person the
[25:14] Prophet said it's not the person that
[25:15] comes predestinated eternally from God
[25:18] it's the word our seed see because all
[25:24] of these persons 7 billion in the world
[25:28] today are predestinated by foreknowledge
[25:32] all right but it takes a lot to be able
[25:41] to say that your predestinated eternally
[25:44] me what I'll have you turn alive well
[25:48] that's good that's enough that's where
[25:50] you're starting from but the thing of it
[25:52] is everybody down through time we're not
[25:54] everybody but all true born-again
[25:56] believers have eternal life in their
[25:59] soul all right see so that puts them
[26:03] into a wonderful position okay and see
[26:07] each age no think about it if it's the
[26:13] seed our word that comes free destinated
[26:16] eternally from God then that cedar word
[26:21] is what we have to deal with to try to
[26:23] stay on to find out what's going on all
[26:26] right and see in the message now they
[26:27] got all this with this seed we come down
[26:29] this way seed we've done this see it
[26:31] sees their seed dad it's just all kind
[26:34] of seeds and you know you know that's
[26:37] well and good maybe they understand what
[26:39] it's talking about but I still got to go
[26:42] back to the one point
[26:45] that no matter what you are what you
[26:48] think about what you are your
[26:52] predestinated by foreknowledge God
[26:56] foreknew everything that would ever take
[26:58] place see that away then he could by
[27:05] knowing everything see here's where
[27:08] people with predestination cutoff see by
[27:10] giving God the point of understanding
[27:14] that it's the word then you can see that
[27:17] he could sit back before the world and
[27:19] watch every person in the world and not
[27:22] handpick him this one or that one
[27:24] because of this or that or the other but
[27:27] he could see that each one that wanted
[27:31] eternal life he would have it ready fall
[27:37] now that doesn't leave us into a whole
[27:39] seal well if we destination is he no no
[27:42] that leaves Robert sad see before the
[27:47] world he would look down through time
[27:49] and he would see you and he would know
[27:56] your desires and your thoughts
[28:00] then he could work according to that and
[28:08] he could predetermine what you're going
[28:14] to be I still problem with that if he
[28:19] sees the end why could he not
[28:21] predetermine it what I said we'll back
[28:27] up into some of those things in
[28:28] predestination maybe in the next message
[28:31] or so but I want you to think about that
[28:35] there's a word allotted for each age
[28:40] I've got a lot of these laying here if
[28:42] you want me to read them then do it but
[28:44] the Prophet said there's a word for
[28:47] every age there's a seed there's a word
[28:49] for every age all right now that seed
[28:53] then our word can come predestinated
[28:56] eternally
[28:59] and the people still dis come
[29:02] predestinated before knowledge and it's
[29:04] still right because if you'll think
[29:09] about it a little bit see we're we're
[29:14] the end time people we're I don't care
[29:17] how much longer we're left here we're
[29:18] still the end time people on the end of
[29:21] all things has come upon us and it's
[29:24] maybes creeping up slow but it's getting
[29:26] on us it's it's there all right and you
[29:30] say well brother Dale if I could just
[29:31] understand if I was predestinate it well
[29:36] why not go back and think about it a
[29:39] little and consider where you come from
[29:42] and how you got to where you're at and
[29:44] why you got to the position you're at
[29:46] and all you know God could be looking at
[29:51] that I mean he is I don't mean he could
[29:54] be he's looking at our lives and our
[29:58] doings and he can predestinate according
[30:03] to what those desires in each one of us
[30:05] but not predestinated according to his
[30:08] desires that's the difference in the
[30:10] story he desired that everybody could be
[30:14] saved I'm quoting brother Branham right
[30:17] he desired everybody could be saved all
[30:21] right but then by his foreknowledge he
[30:24] could look down through and see who
[30:26] would be and who would not be saved
[30:30] and then the word predestination simply
[30:35] means if you hit it in the correct
[30:36] overthinking it just means a destiny set
[30:39] to take place or a time or whatever you
[30:44] want to call it you know it's that set
[30:47] to take place all right see when Martin
[30:52] Luther begin to preach the just shall
[30:53] live by faith
[30:54] it was the seeder word that he was
[30:58] bringing right that seeder word was
[31:04] predestinated eternally in other words
[31:08] God before the world looked down through
[31:10] time and he just didn't pick out this
[31:13] and pick out that but he looked through
[31:15] time and he knew what would take place
[31:19] and when Martin Luther to doctor and
[31:22] preach the just shall live by faith that
[31:25] was what was predestinated from God not
[31:29] to man part the man had to be there they
[31:32] had to be a body there has to be a body
[31:34] for to carry they had to be a body for
[31:38] brother branham to walk on this earth or
[31:40] anybody there has to be a body there
[31:43] that would buy for knowledge God would
[31:45] know that see he doesn't look down and
[31:49] try to figure out you trying to be good
[31:52] either the if it is true that the seed
[31:59] is what comes free destinated eternally
[32:01] we need to be concerned about the seed
[32:03] the word and I by following as to what
[32:09] we hear right
[32:11] eega had it's part of the gospel he's
[32:18] aged had it's part of the Gospel Brunch
[32:21] said already predicted
[32:26] in case you see them that martin
[32:28] luther's our he would be out there
[32:31] trying to preach and to do and he would
[32:36] do windup preaching his message that no
[32:42] doubt he had preached on the scriptures
[32:46] our work says that the just shall live
[32:48] by faith no doubt he had preached
[32:51] services on that no doubt he preached
[32:53] may be commentaries on it cuz that was
[32:55] his doing forgive me but the thing of it
[33:01] was something one day happened to a man
[33:07] named Martin Luther something happened
[33:09] what the connection between the God and
[33:15] the seed come into being now any follow
[33:19] I'm saying
[33:20] then listen is not necessarily the the
[33:23] God and the man came into being that's
[33:26] normal that's part of it but they
[33:29] something happened in that word and
[33:34] Martin Luther as I said it may be
[33:36] preached that and preached and preached
[33:37] it but one day he looked down and he
[33:39] said that's just shall live by faith and
[33:42] they said he wrote alone on one side of
[33:46] it see he saw something then right
[33:53] God caught up with the man because the
[33:59] man was studying the word and so God
[34:03] caught up with that man then you got you
[34:06] a man and God together now that's
[34:08] alright we're getting to a poor coded it
[34:10] has to come out to predetermine it
[34:15] God knew that Martin Luther as I said go
[34:19] today about to sister was telling me a
[34:23] little more on component about where
[34:24] brother Brennan said Abraham leave
[34:27] garden said Abraham God knew Abraham
[34:29] would teach his family he'd do that see
[34:34] now that's for knowledge but what made
[34:37] the difference between Abraham and in
[34:39] lot or anybody else abraham believed god
[34:46] yeah well brother that's too simple
[34:49] no that's where our trouble we try to
[34:52] make it something else that's how simple
[34:53] it really is the Word of God was
[35:00] predetermined to come it would have to
[35:06] come it can't be it can't be without it
[35:08] because he predetermined it alright
[35:12] see then here comes a man walking along
[35:17] and he begins to think on that scripture
[35:22] and it just begins to unfold yeah you
[35:27] ever had that to happen that is you're
[35:31] just thinking on the Word of God and it
[35:33] starts unfolding and the first thing you
[35:36] know you're right into a channel that
[35:39] you've never experienced maybe before
[35:45] it's the word that I'm talking about the
[35:50] word caught up with a man or you say the
[35:53] man caught up with or that's why you
[35:55] won't go with I'm I'm not arguing the
[35:57] points I'm just talking to what I see
[35:59] that that word was to come forth
[36:07] all right see then if it was to come
[36:12] forth then God would have to be there to
[36:15] make it alive and he did in a man called
[36:18] Martin Luther so you can take anybody
[36:20] see anywhere Paul Peter anybody that you
[36:24] wanted to are coming down through or any
[36:26] church age each messenger you can talk
[36:29] about each one of them being a human
[36:32] being immortal that was maybe living
[36:38] better than most of them but still not
[36:41] necessarily so much but something
[36:44] happens and when that happens that seed
[36:49] comes alive that word that you heard
[36:54] comes alive to you you see what I never
[36:58] thought of that
[37:00] I've taught on these things but never
[37:03] thought of it like that do you realize
[37:05] it was so much personal to Martin Luther
[37:11] he turned the world upside down I mean
[37:17] regardless of what you think about him
[37:19] you can think about him being a hater of
[37:22] the Jews you can think about him being a
[37:24] trinitarian you think about him being
[37:26] all kind of things but something struck
[37:29] one day and you realize a man brought
[37:35] forth a message that was not Reformation
[37:39] it was restoration sure you deal with it
[37:44] as the way they were working all as
[37:45] Reformation yes but rudder on says that
[37:48] Luther was was a reformer Wesley was a
[37:51] former he calls Azusa Street a
[37:53] Reformation the I emphasize that because
[37:59] you know the Susur Street would be the
[38:00] baptism with the Holy Ghost poured out
[38:02] on the people but remember at the same
[38:06] time as it was being Reformation called
[38:08] Luther wanted to try to convert to
[38:10] church he didn't want to get out of
[38:13] anyone to convert to church
[38:15] at the same time it was restoration
[38:18] because God said I will restore the
[38:22] years that can't confirm locals
[38:23] caterpillar etc a little words I'm going
[38:28] to Brian C we do how something to do
[38:37] with our predestination because it's
[38:45] according to whether or not we can
[38:46] believe the word C then each age has had
[38:56] its message
[38:59] and it's messenger right
[39:09] ever age packed the message he Said's
[39:13] remembered I won't say he says had the
[39:15] message and the messenger all right
[39:18] when the messenger and the message got
[39:21] together
[39:24] now you're seeing predestination now
[39:29] you're following it the way God wants it
[39:31] to be followed
[39:34] there was a man come forward with a
[39:37] message and it was the messenger to the
[39:40] age he was predestinated to that now may
[39:47] I said without you going the wrong way I
[39:50] didn't say about the flesh I'm talking
[39:52] about the word so then it's the word or
[39:56] the seed of God which is the word of God
[39:59] that comes predestinated eternally from
[40:01] God everything else goes by
[40:03] foreknowledge alright see then he had
[40:10] his message and God had his messenger
[40:16] right he reached down picked up Luther
[40:20] and he said now Luther I know you've
[40:23] been and surely he way was he would have
[40:26] been against the church and the doings
[40:28] you know and he would have been living a
[40:29] good life and doing the things like that
[40:31] but something struck in the man's heart
[40:35] that was dot just a point of trying to
[40:38] live good he saw salvation now were you
[40:45] agree with me Martin Luther sought
[40:47] salvation he didn't just see works and
[40:51] and life's and good doings and dealings
[40:54] and think he saw salvation
[41:02] because he saw the word can you say
[41:06] you've seen the word of this age didn't
[41:12] as there was a messenger that had a
[41:15] message and the Prophet said to
[41:19] messengering the message is one now was
[41:25] my brother branham god no so it's not
[41:30] that away the messenger and the message
[41:34] is one is when that word was made alive
[41:36] to the messenger right when the word
[41:43] became alive to the messenger then the
[41:46] messenger and the message is one right
[41:51] because you're seeing it so it's
[41:56] predestination you remember what we
[41:59] brought out from cross a mystery of God
[42:01] revealed
[42:01] run-run says predestination he said
[42:03] dyers the mystery we should have known
[42:10] that predestination is by foreknowledge
[42:13] so we ought to know that's not the
[42:15] mystery that's being spoken the Prophet
[42:20] goes on to say that that great glorious
[42:24] stand adoption that great glorious 10y
[42:31] so-called something's gonna take place
[42:34] now whether you have followed me on what
[42:37] I've tried to bring for the past few
[42:39] months
[42:39] I pray you have because I'm talking
[42:42] about that word our seed that's been a
[42:44] made alive - you ain't talking about
[42:47] cause you hear a book and you you quote
[42:49] the Prophet and you you you know you
[42:51] quote your Bible and you remember eyes
[42:53] every bit of it I'm asking you has it
[42:56] been made alive to you
[43:00] you know has it come off the pages to
[43:05] live in your life Cosi if if the message
[43:10] and the messenger one then that message
[43:12] come off the pages to the Prophet right
[43:17] well see there's got to come off the
[43:19] pages to you and I but each age each age
[43:32] was predestinated as part of the mystery
[43:35] now follow me
[43:39] but each age is not predestinated unto
[43:45] adoption now we're gonna get in
[43:49] something right follow what I'm saying
[43:52] now for knowledge everything's
[43:55] predestinated there's a seed for each
[43:57] age if we designate a word but just
[44:00] remember when you're reading in
[44:02] Ephesians that's coming down to our time
[44:05] because the Prophet said there's the
[44:08] great mystery he didn't just come to
[44:14] bring a message of the just shall live
[44:16] by faith
[44:19] little Adam didn't come to bring a
[44:21] message about women's hair and clothes
[44:23] and dresses and stunts he come to bring
[44:30] the message of the Word of God this was
[44:32] revealed to him oh but you know it now
[44:36] because I always thought it no come on
[44:39] you're getting into the wrong thing
[44:40] you're thinking that brought around some
[44:41] message is just a book of rules and
[44:44] you're making it Reformation you maybe
[44:48] not even understand the terminology or
[44:50] their thoughts of what's being said but
[44:52] you're making it Reformation you're
[44:54] making it a carnal reform I don't cut my
[44:57] hair I don't wear pants I don't do this
[44:58] I don't do that you can do every bit of
[45:00] that and die and go to hell
[45:02] there's were anointed ones come in out
[45:06] right you can have every bit of that
[45:10] lined up
[45:12] and still be wrong what about that see
[45:17] didn't we say I know I'm saved because I
[45:21] did there's only one way that I know I'm
[45:23] saved
[45:26] can I quote the Prophet and a paraphrase
[45:29] and point others are saying it
[45:30] what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[45:37] whether or not the spirit in you agrees
[45:43] with the word right so it's got a how to
[45:48] do the evidence of the baptism of the
[45:51] Holy Ghost
[45:51] if not our lives in or do it it's how
[45:53] much that word is brought into our
[45:55] hearts and made alive
[45:57] the new birth is when the word is made
[45:59] alive - you see that's that's just
[46:05] simple to me because it's the birth but
[46:11] see each age was predestinated for that
[46:15] age it had its own mess if you read the
[46:18] church ages you know I'm talking about
[46:20] but this age
[46:23] this age is the age the profit I gave it
[46:28] to you over and over where he said where
[46:30] my brother where my sister was it that
[46:33] the time for all this until now this is
[46:43] the age of predestination unto adoption
[46:47] not to just predestinated to you new
[46:49] birth because your predestinated to that
[46:51] I mean that's that's natural Martin
[46:57] Luther name didn't have predestination
[46:59] unto adoption no but they had
[47:07] predestination to the word that was to
[47:10] be in her age they could see and they
[47:14] could live and walk and talk it and be
[47:16] it you hadn't never just sat down and
[47:21] thought about those ages and read a
[47:23] little bit your prophet says now not
[47:25] just me or what the here comes Martin
[47:28] Luther preaching the just shall live by
[47:31] faith why because they turned out to be
[47:33] bunch of legalistic right Catholic
[47:36] Church do's and dont's works and things
[47:39] and Luther preached it just shall live
[47:42] by faith
[47:44] you believe he was church age messenger
[47:47] all right now do you believe John Wesley
[47:49] was a person church eh medicine well see
[47:55] John Wesley picks up trying to bring the
[47:57] church whereas Luther was trying to
[48:00] bring it into by faith
[48:03] John Wesley sees that it's not working
[48:07] that way and he goes with the legalistic
[48:12] form but yet it was the Word of God he
[48:18] was restoration see then here comes many
[48:26] later on that looked like it fell all
[48:29] the way back that they rejected the
[48:33] gospel now they didn't John Wesley was
[48:37] right Luther was right the baptism of
[48:40] the Holy Ghost on a Susur Street was the
[48:42] Word of God the Word of God was made
[48:45] alive in a one-eyed black man and he
[48:47] started a revival right what was made
[48:54] alive the word we need to quit doing
[48:57] this and quit doing that that wasn't
[48:59] what was laid alive no what was made
[49:05] alive was the word to tell you why
[49:08] you're doing that what can't you see
[49:10] salvation that way look at you see
[49:12] salvation - the basis that God is
[49:14] revealing his word I'm not trying to
[49:16] tell you how dirty you are and you need
[49:17] to get straightened up
[49:20] he's trying to tell you how great you
[49:21] are right
[49:30] it's not do's and don'ts its the
[49:35] revealed word and that word being
[49:40] revealed I'm just reading this I'm
[49:41] coming down from brother Brown see every
[49:44] age in times all of that it's not
[49:46] predestinated unto adoption this is the
[49:49] age that's predestinated to adoption no
[49:53] other aids could reach it no other time
[49:56] could be outside of this age well you
[50:02] know what there's somebody got to make
[50:04] that word live oh yeah the way you
[50:11] preach it
[50:12] you know you sound like it you're you're
[50:14] saying we're not try to be good I don't
[50:16] I don't want you to be good I don't want
[50:19] my kids to be good I want them to get
[50:22] saved I want my grandkids and
[50:26] great-grandkids I want them to get saved
[50:28] that'll take care of that they're doing
[50:30] right and wrong yeah we appreciate as a
[50:33] legalistic works I quit this I quit this
[50:37] I don't know what about some of us they
[50:39] didn't do them things to start with what
[50:41] are you gonna do with us
[50:44] I didn't write I didn't do those thought
[50:50] did that make me already saved no that
[50:54] made me in the worst shape because the
[50:56] closer to the truth is the worst part
[50:59] all right what are you trying to say now
[51:02] bro today I'm trying to talk about this
[51:08] AIDS and what is to be done in this age
[51:14] and it's so marvelous
[51:17] this was the age that was giving the
[51:19] given the entire Bible
[51:22] right you did not come through the
[51:27] prophets message you do not bring the
[51:31] entire mysteries of the Bible this age
[51:38] not none of the other ages the appalling
[51:43] them didn't know that in about two seals
[51:44] they didn't even talk about him they
[51:46] didn't preach about it because they
[51:47] didn't understand even though Jesus had
[51:51] preached it in Matthew 24 they still
[51:54] couldn't follow that Paul didn't come
[51:56] along with a sermon on Matthew 24 or
[51:58] some of the others no one explained the
[52:00] seals and thanks to you know but it was
[52:02] left to this age here comes a prophet
[52:08] God begins to open the word to it it
[52:13] just keeps unfolding until it unfolded
[52:19] into his adoption as I told you I told
[52:25] you what I think I just think it so I
[52:27] don't matter to me I'll tell you anyway
[52:29] the Lord Jesus was adopted when he got
[52:31] the Mount of Transfiguration that's what
[52:34] your prophet says better brand him when
[52:39] he got to sunset mountain I believe he
[52:42] was adopted you say well I think he was
[52:45] four then with us it's just me and you
[52:47] both talking so that's all right we just
[52:49] you put yours in the word and let's see
[52:54] what you see here identically fit the
[52:57] scriptures of the lord jesus' ministry
[52:59] into his life the word came forth
[53:08] the word that the world had waited on
[53:14] waited on melikhaya for right way to
[53:19] don't luke 1730 revelation 10 7 the
[53:24] world was waiting on it and here comes a
[53:27] man to bring that word seed a message
[53:34] that he brought ok
[53:40] unto adoption
[53:47] this age this is the greatest of all
[53:50] ages did your prophet make this
[53:52] statement he said if if it was anywhere
[53:54] in any time would be a age he would draw
[53:56] the beard to be this age you know
[53:59] evidently he I don't think it was just
[54:03] because of a better world to live in
[54:06] maybe it seemingly I think it was what
[54:09] was taking place the word begin to be
[54:14] revealed to the Prophet and he brought
[54:16] it to the bride knowing then as he come
[54:20] along he said now your adoption is not
[54:24] your birth he said your adoption is your
[54:31] placing
[54:33] now listen for a second man a placing so
[54:38] that means if it's a placing it means
[54:41] something personal placing people being
[54:46] placed in position people being placed
[54:56] adoption taking place children growing
[54:59] up to be sons and daughters of the
[55:04] Living God but I just don't see it we'll
[55:08] see that don't mean it ain't here you'd
[55:11] have been here when the Lord Jesus was
[55:12] here and said dad that's the same thing
[55:14] it out and then does now I don't in that
[55:17] don't that be littles instead of trying
[55:22] to make you look like you know something
[55:24] sorry is that the best way to say it
[55:33] but listen an eternal people
[55:39] predestinated to eternal life you need
[55:46] for me to repay a predestinated people
[55:52] predestinated to eternal life somebody
[55:57] is going to be changed right why cause
[56:00] the Bible says it right to solve the
[56:03] problem we got that out of the way the
[56:06] Bible said you'll be changing won't
[56:07] dream of somebody somebody's gonna do
[56:09] that so they can't be that you said what
[56:12] I don't believe that I don't know that I
[56:14] think got nothing to do with it because
[56:15] somebody's gonna be there cause God said
[56:17] it alright and see a predestinated
[56:25] people would with eternal life would be
[56:31] the seed of that age
[56:34] what is this age the entire Bible being
[56:41] revealed right sixty-six books being
[56:48] revealed revealing about what what is
[56:53] the book talking about it's talking
[56:56] about a predestinated people
[57:03] but not just to predestinated people by
[57:06] foreknowledge but a predestinated people
[57:09] of eternal life you realize if you have
[57:15] the new birth today you have eternal
[57:17] life in your soul and you know that then
[57:22] you were predestinated for that to come
[57:24] forth that's wonderful
[57:27] but what about still that would put you
[57:29] like Martin Luther that puts you in the
[57:31] position of following the word for your
[57:34] age but what about a people that one day
[57:38] will walk off the earth now you can see
[57:44] then why the Bible says day without us
[57:45] could not be made perfect they go
[57:53] somebody's gonna come to the word that
[57:59] the Prophet brought
[58:04] but it don't have to be then I'm gonna
[58:07] tie this together with the two parts of
[58:08] what I'm talking about it don't have to
[58:11] be people with see what we want to see
[58:15] signs and wonders that's well and good
[58:19] you know that's that's good we all enjoy
[58:22] that we love the presence of God we want
[58:26] to see people live good lives and serve
[58:31] God that's all well and good we'll see
[58:34] if it's not something personal to you
[58:36] what do you got
[58:43] I'm talking about something to work that
[58:46] you'll realize where you're at you
[58:52] realize what God has done for you paint
[58:58] back in your life where you come from
[59:03] just think back in your life where you
[59:05] come from
[59:05] and realize there's been him all the
[59:09] time this brought us to this place none
[59:14] of us wanted what we got come on
[59:17] oh yeah we all wanted the presence of
[59:21] the Lord we all wanted things to feel
[59:22] good we want everything like it would do
[59:24] it would but we didn't realize what was
[59:28] taking place what about that prophet
[59:35] standing out our on the Ohio River when
[59:37] a voice from heaven says your message
[59:41] will forerun the second coming raaah
[59:47] your message will forerun the second
[59:50] coming you think that wasn't something
[59:51] personal to him but like I've always
[59:56] said till he gets over 200 spoken words
[1:00:00] original seed and he says as I've yet
[1:00:02] Malachi 4 is not fulfil well brother ask
[1:00:06] him one time you know do you believe
[1:00:09] that's you and he said yeah I think he
[1:00:11] believed that was him don't you but then
[1:00:14] something happened in that message and
[1:00:16] God said pick up your pen and write I
[1:00:18] got something I got to explain to you
[1:00:21] and he says as of yet Malachi 4 is not
[1:00:25] fulfill well don't you think did he set
[1:00:29] out to try to fulfill Malachi 4 wouldn't
[1:00:31] you
[1:00:34] but I mean you're starting home tonight
[1:00:37] and something speaks to you and says
[1:00:39] don't go that way turn out here and go
[1:00:41] down this other road go different way
[1:00:42] cause there's problems well if you've
[1:00:46] got any sense at all you'd listen to
[1:00:47] that there without how I fool around yes
[1:00:51] you know that's about two places we do
[1:00:54] what are you listening because you see
[1:01:03] the new birth is the ceiling in of the
[1:01:08] individual into the body of Christ all
[1:01:12] right
[1:01:13] that's not your adoption in the point of
[1:01:16] the adoptions and the the the coming
[1:01:19] down the three stages that's the new
[1:01:23] birth your babe in Christ but you're
[1:01:26] sealed in the kingdom right
[1:01:33] now sealed in the kingdom of God
[1:01:38] something personal happening but you got
[1:01:45] anointed ones they take out all kind of
[1:01:49] signs and wonders right I don't it going
[1:01:57] to have all kind of signs and wonders
[1:01:58] right but they're not sealed in the
[1:02:02] kingdom as a matter of fact they're
[1:02:06] sealed out there outside the kingdom
[1:02:10] they're sealed out they can't get in you
[1:02:12] can't get in being an anointed one you
[1:02:17] got to have more than just an anointing
[1:02:19] on your spirit
[1:02:26] all right then see if anointed ones are
[1:02:32] sealed out because you're the ones with
[1:02:37] the Holy Ghost is sealed in the soul of
[1:02:41] the individual looking at down on Inori
[1:02:43] wants the end time the seal of the
[1:02:46] individual is the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:49] Ghost to seal us in the kingdom of God
[1:02:51] by the new birth the anointed ones never
[1:02:58] get to happen yet look at them as far as
[1:03:05] outward emotions and signs anointed ones
[1:03:09] outshine the bride across right
[1:03:20] you
[1:03:22] but what good is it what do you mean
[1:03:26] brother than what good is it we serve
[1:03:27] God we worship God we have a good time
[1:03:30] we do yeah then you're sealed out you
[1:03:39] got somebody over here that's just
[1:03:41] struggling to live walking day by day
[1:03:45] and things of life trying to serve God
[1:03:48] and you see them struggling and yet
[1:03:53] they're sealed in the kingdom which one
[1:03:55] do you want don't know where you've ever
[1:04:02] thought about it it just clicked on the
[1:04:03] other day
[1:04:04] anointed ones you know that's the seal
[1:04:07] of God now now the true bride is not
[1:04:09] anointed on their spirit their anointed
[1:04:11] in the soul by the new birth anointed
[1:04:16] ones are anointed on their spirit realm
[1:04:19] memory reason conscious affections
[1:04:21] invite which one do we want to be
[1:04:33] because that's what we're doing we're
[1:04:34] proving one way or the other we're
[1:04:41] proving what we are right every day
[1:04:47] we're proving what we are what we're
[1:04:50] doing that's why I give me the word well
[1:04:57] I want to knowing I want I'll do I live
[1:04:59] I enjoy it I love it it's great but give
[1:05:02] me the word because the word is what
[1:05:08] seals me in okay
[1:05:17] but now anointed ones are sealed out
[1:05:20] because they can't follow the word
[1:05:24] they'll go so far is that what's your
[1:05:27] profits it did Balaam go so far Balaam
[1:05:31] had all the anointing that all the signs
[1:05:33] and wonders are all kind of things
[1:05:34] happening but when he faced a real
[1:05:38] prophet he proved then what he was is
[1:05:46] the church I'm trying to get you to look
[1:05:48] at something personal of being
[1:05:51] predestinated unto adoption this is the
[1:05:56] age this is the time this is the place
[1:05:58] there's never been an age like this
[1:06:00] there's never been a time like this
[1:06:05] that's not talking about natural bad
[1:06:08] things I'm talking about the Bride of
[1:06:13] Christ having now the Word of God
[1:06:22] but do we cherish it as the word
[1:06:30] simply thought to you just putting two
[1:06:33] things together anointed ones how great
[1:06:39] signs and wonders they won't talk to you
[1:06:45] about the word nobody ones the end I'm
[1:06:51] brother Brent I'm talking about that
[1:06:53] lady cutting the garage like he said
[1:06:54] that's why you can't tell her it's wrong
[1:06:56] for her doctor cutting graves for their
[1:06:58] schwartz on the time he succumbs she's
[1:07:01] anointed then women come up to him win
[1:07:06] brief he said i'm not gonna tell you
[1:07:09] that you're not called to preach he said
[1:07:14] i will tell you it's not in the word but
[1:07:20] he said i'm not gonna eat it that's
[1:07:21] between you and God which one do we want
[1:07:28] to be an adopted manifested son or
[1:07:33] daughter of God or just being an
[1:07:35] anointed one to have great signs and
[1:07:37] wonders and all kind of things taking
[1:07:39] place healings and signs and wonders and
[1:07:41] all like that which do you want go
[1:07:48] remember it gives you the desire of your
[1:07:51] heart right you'll give you the desire
[1:07:58] of your heart so don't desire a lot of
[1:08:01] things if you don't really want it well
[1:08:07] I want the signs and wonders of God
[1:08:08] dwelling among us amen we do but now am
[1:08:14] I gonna put that ahead of the word give
[1:08:18] me the word first and then those things
[1:08:20] will take place don't put that first
[1:08:22] don't put anointed ones first you're in
[1:08:24] bad shape because you see Urena
[1:08:26] understanding what i just say it
[1:08:28] anointed ones are not sealed in the body
[1:08:31] of Christ they're sealed out of the body
[1:08:34] of Christ true born-again Christians are
[1:08:37] sealed in the body of Christ
[1:08:43] you know what I'm sort of loves to see
[1:08:45] this I'd lovely I'd love to have those
[1:08:47] days back yell when I that's good I
[1:08:49] would do oh but now and we're gonna say
[1:08:53] this is gonna hurt all of our feelings
[1:08:55] you know why that those things are not
[1:08:57] among us today because of you and me
[1:09:05] okay we got it solved you and me because
[1:09:13] we're the only ones didn't keep it from
[1:09:14] happening right we're the ones that can
[1:09:21] keep from God doing things so he's
[1:09:25] waiting on us to get out of the way
[1:09:30] what is it what about it being so much
[1:09:35] that you could be anointed one your
[1:09:36] spirit with the genuine baptism of the
[1:09:41] Holy Spirit and still be lost that's
[1:09:49] hard for the human mind to comprehend
[1:09:52] the Prophet says it's true
[1:10:00] I want to find the day that I'm living
[1:10:03] if you understand what I'm driving at my
[1:10:07] whole point of what I'm talking about
[1:10:09] tonight is one thing finding out who I
[1:10:11] am and where I'm at and what's to be
[1:10:14] expected of this age
[1:10:23] the word to be open to us is the most
[1:10:29] marvelous thing that could ever be
[1:10:31] thought of is to understand the Bible
[1:10:34] and it be revealed
[1:10:43] are you just thinking about what I'm
[1:10:45] saying then to think about you could be
[1:10:49] so anointed with all of that and have
[1:10:53] all of those great things and still be
[1:10:58] sealed out of the kingdom that's my
[1:11:06] whole point
[1:11:09] behind another day that we're living
[1:11:12] cause now listen to what I'm saying
[1:11:15] there has never been an age like this
[1:11:20] there has never been a time when
[1:11:22] anointed ones we're here like they are
[1:11:27] now right well that was anointed isn't
[1:11:32] it no not like it is now because see
[1:11:35] it's so close it would deceive the very
[1:11:37] elect if it was possible may I continue
[1:11:42] the quote the Prophet said on that one
[1:11:44] day he said frankly you'd get to pride
[1:11:47] so confuse me that's cut to work short
[1:11:49] now I paraphrase that it's pretty close
[1:11:52] to the truth what about it do you want
[1:12:01] to be an anointed one and have great
[1:12:04] signs and wonders some great
[1:12:05] opportunities and all like that great
[1:12:07] healings a great thing or you want to be
[1:12:10] the bride
[1:12:11] it'll take the word and stand on the
[1:12:15] word but you see I've never looked like
[1:12:22] a lot of people looked at adoption I've
[1:12:23] always tried to do one thing and I've
[1:12:26] talked to us from the beginning 40 years
[1:12:28] or more ago I've never looked at
[1:12:31] anointed ones to be like what a people
[1:12:34] think most of all I've ever heard talk
[1:12:37] about our adoption and things like that
[1:12:41] is it it's bringing them into view
[1:12:50] No
[1:12:54] you don't put a tutor with a man a child
[1:12:58] to raise him up to have those kind of
[1:13:01] thoughts you put a tutor with a child to
[1:13:04] raise them up to how the thoughts or the
[1:13:06] father or the intents of the father or
[1:13:10] what the father won't adoption is to
[1:13:12] bring the father on the scene not to
[1:13:15] bring the children on this thing
[1:13:17] that's what follows it but adoption is
[1:13:21] to bring the father into view in his
[1:13:27] children that's the day that we're
[1:13:31] living adoption age when the bride
[1:13:40] realized who she is the Prophet says
[1:13:42] she'll be an invincible army well I
[1:13:48] think we ought to begin to consider the
[1:13:51] things in maybe a little different way
[1:13:54] as I said because we think about
[1:13:56] adoption let me repeat that again where
[1:13:58] you won't miss it
[1:13:59] we think adoption is to bring this is
[1:14:02] the father to bring the son on the scene
[1:14:04] no adoption is for the son to get out of
[1:14:10] the way and let the father come on the
[1:14:14] scene let's get out of the way and quit
[1:14:20] hindering God with our little piti piti
[1:14:23] piti ideas and thoughts and get it
[1:14:27] settled in one time God wants a group of
[1:14:31] people to stand for his word he'll take
[1:14:37] care of the rest of it you think I'm
[1:14:41] worried about the end of the world
[1:14:43] you think I'm concerned about life and
[1:14:47] government and who's running for who and
[1:14:49] what's running for what
[1:14:57] owls told you back under hey if you
[1:15:00] think Hillary getting in the White House
[1:15:02] would get this thing to going let's put
[1:15:04] Hillary in two or three women in there
[1:15:06] altogether and just give them the whole
[1:15:07] thing I'm serious just let them have it
[1:15:13] they need it's gonna be a surprise to
[1:15:18] all of us when this is finished I
[1:15:20] believe to see how foolish we thought
[1:15:24] you know how good we thought we were or
[1:15:27] had it all figured out until God comes
[1:15:30] on the scene and makes it so simple this
[1:15:36] is the age of adoption it was never
[1:15:39] before this age the adoption the Bible
[1:15:42] talking about I preached it to you now
[1:15:44] if you're listening some of your minds
[1:15:46] is running and running and saying yeah
[1:15:48] but you preach the other day right when
[1:15:51] you're born into the family of God you
[1:15:53] are adopted into the family of God by
[1:15:57] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that
[1:16:00] is not your headstone that is not the
[1:16:03] statue of a perfect man those has to be
[1:16:05] developed through the child trainings
[1:16:07] etc and coming out to the ending of it
[1:16:12] it's according to how you're using it
[1:16:15] and this is the age of adoption not
[1:16:19] meaning that God wouldn't in other ages
[1:16:21] and doing things all way down through
[1:16:22] there he always was but now he's doing
[1:16:27] it greater than ever because he's
[1:16:30] putting into the hands of his children
[1:16:33] the right understanding about the word
[1:16:40] what do you think well I'd like to have
[1:16:42] this I'd like to have that I wish we can
[1:16:43] get back to the great days all right
[1:16:49] but where will that put us out of here
[1:16:51] in a rapture
[1:16:57] come on musician let's just leave it
[1:17:01] with you I hope it strikes home the
[1:17:07] thought that our knowing it once look
[1:17:12] how they do with what they can do and
[1:17:13] things could have but they're not sealed
[1:17:15] in the body of Christ but the least
[1:17:18] member of the body of Christ that's
[1:17:21] sealed in by the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:23] Ghost is greater than all of those that
[1:17:26] are anointed because this is the age of
[1:17:33] adoption this is not the age of the new
[1:17:38] birth this is not the age of
[1:17:41] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:17:43] of the Holy Ghost this is the age of the
[1:17:45] fully revealed Word of God to go from
[1:17:47] Genesis to Revelation this is the age of
[1:17:50] it this is the time this is when we
[1:17:53] should be rejoicing I'm rejoicing in my
[1:17:56] soul of thinking about the things but
[1:17:58] dying in my flesh into knowing what's
[1:18:02] happening to the world and the people
[1:18:03] and all the things that are happening
[1:18:05] but in my soul this is set to one thing
[1:18:09] I've never been and you know yourself
[1:18:12] you've been women some of you 40 50
[1:18:14] years I never tried to teach anything
[1:18:16] about the end of all things coming here
[1:18:17] I talked to you back there in 74 that
[1:18:22] with the pice of year 2026 so you know
[1:18:25] I'm not trying to do that what I'm
[1:18:27] saying now you better be serious things
[1:18:34] are getting worse oh yeah what do you
[1:18:40] think you know who said I don't care
[1:18:41] who's president the Bible says I put in
[1:18:45] Kings and I take out Kings so whoever
[1:18:49] who that he wants to be the next
[1:18:52] president is going to be the next
[1:18:54] president if nobody in the world votes
[1:18:56] or if everybody votes for one person
[1:18:59] except for one person out of the whole
[1:19:02] seven billion then they'll look down and
[1:19:05] say well then six billions wrong we're
[1:19:09] gonna take this one vote
[1:19:10] you understand what a meaning simple
[1:19:12] language when they want to move in they
[1:19:15] move they do what they want to do it's
[1:19:17] not for me and you if they want to close
[1:19:20] us out today they can close this out
[1:19:22] name the thing in the world we can do
[1:19:23] about it well gods don't take God take
[1:19:30] care of us ride what a day but to think
[1:19:36] that we're here if you don't get nothing
[1:19:39] out of the message they get one time
[1:19:41] Roselle believes we're in the age of
[1:19:42] adoption and adoption means that God is
[1:19:45] here God is on the scene taking us out
[1:19:53] of here I believe that let's take what
[1:19:57] we got 596 I feel the pool
