[20:01] just as a candle cannot burn Without

[20:11] life what's a candle to do a candle is
[20:14] to be lit right that's what you use a
[20:17] candle for you light it that's what a
[20:19] spiritual life is for it's for you to
[20:21] light it and let it project and we're
[20:24] going to talk about that a little bit
[20:25] this this uh morning because we want to
[20:30] continue on this but we're going to talk
[20:31] about
[20:32] sanctification in the time of of uh John
[20:36] Wesley and then into our day that we're
[20:40] living in all right so if you got your
[20:42] Bibles you turn to the book of to the
[20:45] Book of Revelations 1 and we're like I
[20:47] said we're going to be a little slow if
[20:49] we have to continue this afternoon
[20:50] that'll be fine but I want the um
[20:53] visitors to to catch up a little bit and
[20:56] see kind of what we're talking about
[20:58] listen listen the Holy Ghost said he
[20:59] would lead you and guide you into all
[21:01] truth so believe in the Holy Ghost
[21:04] forget about the Devil he's going to be
[21:06] there all right he's there already
[21:08] talking to you you know so just let the
[21:11] Holy Ghost open the word up to you he's
[21:13] the only revealer of the word I can't do
[21:15] it these ministers can't do it but I
[21:18] promise you when we get to the end of
[21:19] this sermon you'll see why brother Bob
[21:21] did what he did today you'll see my
[21:23] brother klie read the same scripture I'm
[21:26] not going to read that scripture but you
[21:27] watch and see when we get to the very
[21:29] end what I'm going to speak about on
[21:31] sanctification it absolutely you could
[21:32] put all three of them together and it's
[21:34] just a symphony and we sure appreciate
[21:36] the Lord for that so let's bow our
[21:39] heads dear Lord Jesus thank you for this
[21:42] morning you've give
[21:43] us and for this group of people Lord the
[21:47] purchase of your blood and as the
[21:50] prophet was saying there he said oh give
[21:52] me a church full of the Holy Ghost give
[21:56] me a church that we can come in and
[21:59] and sit down and listen to you Lord and
[22:01] and have all the flu unstopped and and
[22:04] all the filters unplugged and we can
[22:07] hear Lord and we can react and say
[22:09] praise the Lord or glory to God or
[22:11] Hallelujah because it resonates inside
[22:14] of our soul there's something inside of
[22:16] us that's yearning for something besides
[22:18] this world and father I pray that you'd
[22:20] be with us now open the word to us Lord
[22:23] be with the ones that are here Lord that
[22:25] are visiting we pray that you'd bless
[22:27] them and and Lord I pray that you would
[22:29] touch each life that's we have many on
[22:31] vacation brother John durett just called
[22:33] there in Pigeon Forge brother Terrence
[22:35] and brother Zach they're over in Myrtle
[22:37] Beach and brother Ryan is in Kentucky so
[22:39] we have several people scattered around
[22:42] and I pray that you'd be with them Lord
[22:43] and bring them back safe father but the
[22:45] ones that are here Lord I pray that you
[22:47] would touch us father anoint us for the
[22:49] job that we have to do and the job is to
[22:52] preach and the job is to hear it's what
[22:55] the spirit says to the churches father
[22:57] just be with the ones that are sick we
[22:59] love you in Jesus name amen Revelations
[23:03] 1: 10 we've been on this for a while
[23:06] but I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[23:08] day and heard behind me a great voice as
[23:10] of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega
[23:13] now
[23:14] remember that's the book ends that's the
[23:17] beginning Alpha and the ending Omega
[23:20] they're to be the same all right that's
[23:23] why there had to be a restoration
[23:24] between the two that was a falling away
[23:27] we'll get to it in a minute and then
[23:28] there's a restoration back to what to
[23:30] the full word of God in the end time all
[23:33] right so you're part of that you're the
[23:35] Omega bride all right you're the Omega
[23:38] bride you're the one that the whole
[23:39] thing is going to end up in Israel is
[23:42] waiting on you amen and me to fulfill
[23:46] our part as a gentile and then move on
[23:49] over to them all right so I say let's
[23:52] get going let's get it done and what
[23:56] thou seest right in the book and send it
[23:57] to the seven Church churches which are
[23:58] in Asia and that's the seven Church ages
[24:01] Ephesus SM these were real cities and
[24:04] the characteristics of these cities
[24:05] match what was in the Bible so it had to
[24:07] be a God thing it had to be God do it
[24:10] because he told then he told John to
[24:12] write it and send it to him send it to
[24:14] the church that was there don't send it
[24:15] to the city don't send it to the chief
[24:17] magistrate don't send it to the mayor
[24:20] right send it to the people that's going
[24:22] to listen to what's being said and I
[24:24] hope today we are the people that the
[24:26] Lord has give us an opportunity in this
[24:29] Omega age to learn and and to know where
[24:32] we're at and I know what we're doing
[24:33] here and to know why that we're here in
[24:35] the
[24:36] beginning why we're here to start with
[24:39] but write it to all these churches I'm
[24:41] not going to read them all we know we're
[24:42] in the lay ofy and age we are in that
[24:44] time slot but we've been caught out of
[24:46] the age every bride and every age has
[24:48] been caught up out of the
[24:50] age they get they do get the blessings
[24:52] but they do get the cursings all right
[24:55] and I turned to see the voice that spake
[24:56] with me and being turned I saw seven
[24:59] golden candlesticks now we know that's
[25:01] the manora that's the seven candlesticks
[25:03] that are lit and we'll talk about that
[25:05] maybe this evening about the second the
[25:09] first Veil going into the holy place now
[25:12] not the holy of holies the holy of
[25:14] holies is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[25:15] right but the holy place is the second
[25:18] one and that's
[25:19] sanctification okay now you ready and
[25:22] then the midst of the seven candlesticks
[25:23] one liken to the son of man clothed with
[25:25] a garment down to the foot and G about
[25:27] to B pap with a golden girdle so here is
[25:30] Jesus Christ standing there in Bride
[25:32] form being gir about here the paps
[25:35] covered breast which signifies female
[25:39] and that's the bride so it's Jesus
[25:41] Christ has what brothers he's in morphed
[25:44] and sisters imorph into me and you he's
[25:48] IM morphed into the bride I was reading
[25:50] brother Brown a day or two ago he said
[25:53] he said when she we said we always say
[25:55] oh she is him well do we really realize
[25:57] that
[25:58] that she is definitely him not a second
[26:02] person we got to see that you may be SE
[26:05] and I'll read the rest of this while
[26:06] you're sitting down I know you're
[26:10] tired but now we're on the Philadelphia
[26:14] and church Age and and for the sake of
[26:16] the brothers and sisters that that come
[26:17] in we'll we'll just kind of give an
[26:20] overview of what we've been speaking on
[26:24] but Revelations 3:7 says and the angel
[26:27] the Church of Philadelphia now remember
[26:28] there was an angel to every age right
[26:30] not three or four one God spoke to that
[26:34] person that PO that person grabbed the
[26:35] Revelation that was from God and he
[26:38] spoke it to the people he literally had
[26:40] the mind of
[26:41] God Amen if not he wouldn't wrote it in
[26:44] the Bible that's
[26:47] right these things sayith he that is
[26:49] Holy he that is true he that hath the
[26:51] Key of David he that openeth and no man
[26:54] shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth
[26:56] I Know Thy works like brother Bob was
[26:59] saying about Job God knew the whole deal
[27:01] about job before the foundation of the
[27:03] world but job didn't and I don't believe
[27:06] the devil knew what was going to happen
[27:07] at the end I don't believe he can see
[27:09] very far in the future if he does he'd
[27:11] be real
[27:12] scared but remember God doesn't give him
[27:18] Revelation he formulates his own
[27:21] whatever story cuz he's a liar everybody
[27:24] with me but he makes it so close till it
[27:27] sounds good look
[27:29] good Satan's seed is
[27:32] here it's not somewhere else we're you
[27:35] know if you're waiting for a pope to set
[27:37] over in Rome and
[27:40] become Satan incarnate you're fooled cuz
[27:44] you're not going to be here if you're a
[27:46] bride you're not going to be here let's
[27:47] get him out of this seat right here
[27:50] let's get him out of this part let's not
[27:52] let him be incarnate here that's right
[27:55] amen don't worry about over there well
[27:56] who's going to be the pope where you
[27:57] going to come from we know what brother
[27:59] R said about those things but remember
[28:00] we're gone yes so this irrelevant it's
[28:04] good to talk about but it's irrelevant
[28:06] that we're going to even see the guy
[28:09] become incarnate because you know what
[28:10] we're going to see the Incarnation of a
[28:13] bride of Jesus Christ he's going to be
[28:15] incarnated in a bride and that's what's
[28:17] going to bring the dead out of the
[28:19] ground that's what's going to bring the
[28:20] body change if when we see Christ
[28:23] already incarnate inside of me and you
[28:26] but we got to go through justification
[28:28] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[28:30] Ghost which is the Holy Ghost himself
[28:32] the word of God coming and living inside
[28:36] of you not just anointing
[28:39] you you know I I know um most of you
[28:43] know what I'm talking about but but it's
[28:46] I won't call any
[28:47] names but we just went through a
[28:49] situation where a brother and sister of
[28:53] certain Church left the message and
[28:55] they're out doing just ungodly stuff
[28:59] but they cried when they sang they cried
[29:03] when you
[29:04] pray they cried when they hear the word
[29:07] of
[29:08] God they're so
[29:12] humble didn't have one o of the Holy
[29:14] Ghost in their soul or they wouldn't do
[29:16] what they were doing
[29:18] now I'm warning you I'm warning you just
[29:23] because you feel something just because
[29:25] you might have a little seniority over
[29:27] somebody else and you've been s in your
[29:28] favorite seat for 30
[29:31] years if you ain't got the holy ghost in
[29:33] your soul you're
[29:35] lost period you are lost and you need
[29:40] the holy ghost in your
[29:43] soul Satan can anoint you every service
[29:47] he can anoint you absolutely he can
[29:50] anoint you somewhere else but as brother
[29:52] Bob and him are saying it's the
[29:54] life it's that consecration it's that
[29:57] it's that having Integrity yes to be
[30:01] able to whip the devil with that amen so
[30:05] just realize that I want you to realize
[30:07] that you see people and you see people
[30:09] like Tim
[30:10] Humes I'll call him
[30:12] brother preached 40 years huge
[30:17] church out denying the message
[30:20] now where was his holy ghost
[30:23] anointing it was on his Spirit realm or
[30:25] he would not turn the word down Abol the
[30:28] Holy Ghost can't turn the word
[30:30] down cuz that is the word of God and
[30:33] that's why you respond and say Amen
[30:35] sorry brother L I'm getting excited and
[30:37] he told me to kind of slow down a little
[30:39] bit so just okay I'll slow down brother
[30:43] God bless you at least at least they're
[30:47] honest if I get to going too fast
[30:51] go uh how you say inan espan slow down
[30:56] espan right slow down I'm learning I got
[30:58] one
[30:59] word for thou Hast a little little
[31:02] strength and Hast kept my word and Hast
[31:04] not denied my name behold I will make
[31:07] them of the synagogue of Satan which say
[31:09] they are Jews and are not but do lie
[31:11] behold I will make them to come and
[31:12] worship before thy feet and to know that
[31:15] I have loved thee there's the mighty
[31:18] conqueror where's that Mighty conqueror
[31:20] though it's in those people in that
[31:21] Philadelphian age they conquered the
[31:24] world with the word of God they went it
[31:28] was an open door to all these different
[31:30] missionaries that Livingston and
[31:32] different ones that went out
[31:34] and and missionar the world and and got
[31:37] people to turn away from Satan and turn
[31:40] to God and they'll be
[31:42] there I think sometimes we think it's
[31:45] our forign no more no the world's going
[31:47] to be full when we get in that City the
[31:49] city's going to be full and that world's
[31:52] going to be full of Eternal people
[31:55] am and if you're an eternal person
[31:57] person and you're going to and you're
[31:59] living in eternity in heaven there's
[32:01] somewhere you got in contact with God
[32:03] here yes sir you oh what about well what
[32:07] about a cup of water in my name who'
[32:09] they give it
[32:10] to come on who did you get who did the
[32:12] water get brother Dy brother collie
[32:15] there's the
[32:16] connection you hold eternal life in your
[32:20] body today if you're bride yes and that
[32:24] cup of water is going to be to Jesus
[32:27] Christ not to these Brothers I just
[32:28] called their name no you giving it to
[32:31] him that's why we must give him our all
[32:35] that's why we're falling short of giving
[32:36] him our all come on
[32:40] somebody because thou H has kept the
[32:42] word of my
[32:44] patience I also will keep thee from the
[32:46] hour of Temptation what kept job from
[32:50] the hour of Temptation it sure wasn't
[32:52] his
[32:54] wife it sure wasn't his three best
[32:57] friends
[33:00] huh huh but when eliu showed up or that
[33:04] last one which portrayed Christ he said
[33:08] job stand
[33:09] up I'm fixing to tell you something that
[33:12] them other three has not told you on and
[33:16] then what did job do he got a revelation
[33:18] when Christ comes on the scene he clears
[33:19] everything up listen if somebody steps
[33:22] on a scene in your life and it causes
[33:24] confusion it is not
[33:26] God it is not God God is not the author
[33:29] author of confusion we may go through
[33:31] tough times we may go through ups and
[33:34] downs but
[33:36] but we still got God inside of us as
[33:40] brother Bob said it really everything
[33:42] that job went through was just part of
[33:44] his life right and that's what made job
[33:48] who he was that's why I said about a
[33:51] Christian a true Christian tragedy does
[33:53] not destroy
[33:55] you it compliments you actually
[33:59] it actually makes you
[34:01] stronger right right tragedy does not
[34:04] destroy if you fall
[34:06] apart and you quit church and you say
[34:09] God don't love me no more and the pastor
[34:12] hates
[34:14] me that ain't
[34:16] God that's the
[34:20] devil listen we have had I was I was
[34:23] preaching last Sunday we've had the
[34:25] seals opened yes but that thing now is
[34:28] closed inside of
[34:30] you the only thing you got to do is is
[34:33] let the part out that the people can
[34:35] see huh you got to keep that secret in
[34:39] your heart the problem with Satan was
[34:42] well I'm getting on a different subject
[34:43] here thank you brother Bob but the part
[34:45] that Satan couldn't stand was he
[34:47] couldn't get in job's
[34:49] Soul he couldn't get he could he could
[34:52] do everything around
[34:54] job but he didn't know what job was
[34:56] thinking in his soul
[34:58] now not just what concs in your head
[35:01] right it's what's down
[35:04] inside right that's still small voice oh
[35:07] oh thunder lightning blah blah blah but
[35:10] the still Small Voice is what we must
[35:12] Listen to We're going to have UPS we're
[35:15] going to have Downs we're going to have
[35:16] despair we're going to have good times
[35:17] and bad times but thank God the prophet
[35:20] said he said just because you got a
[35:22] cloudy day don't mean God hates you if
[35:24] you have a sunny day that he loves you
[35:26] listen God can't change his mind if he
[35:29] ever loved you in the beginning he can't
[35:32] unlove
[35:33] you that's why the tragedy in a
[35:35] Christian's life builds
[35:38] character and integrity and Satan don't
[35:41] know what to do with you when you go
[35:43] through that Satan does not have a clue
[35:46] what to do with you cuz he destroys
[35:48] people out there and he sees what they
[35:50] do they go to drugs
[35:51] alcohol XYZ
[35:54] right I'm going through a tough time
[35:57] we'll go to God that's what we as
[36:00] Christians do we go to God we don't hide
[36:02] under a well hide under your own chair
[36:05] your home you go to
[36:09] church I don't know where that come from
[36:11] but that didn't I didn't charge you
[36:12] anything for that all right so because
[36:14] thou has kept the word of my patience
[36:16] but listen this is an unsealing age yes
[36:20] it is cuz the seals are open but I read
[36:23] you that scripture and so did Brother
[36:25] collie read it amen grieve not the holy
[36:28] spirit of God whereby you
[36:30] are sealed H so God puts it in there and
[36:34] he seals it back up where listen what
[36:36] did Brother Bram say he said if I tell
[36:39] it Satan can hear it now that's not a
[36:42] direct quote but that's close enough
[36:44] you'll find it he said but now if I keep
[36:47] it in my
[36:48] heart that's one thing Satan can't do
[36:51] folks to a Believer he cannot he cannot
[36:56] interpret what's in your
[36:58] all cuz he don't know do he know what to
[37:01] do with Jesus he did everything in the
[37:03] world and he didn't defeat him so
[37:05] where's that man
[37:08] at huh take your finger take your finger
[37:12] point hey point do this right here
[37:15] that's where Jesus is now right here
[37:18] he's not in heaven he's not over the sea
[37:20] he's not thee even in the heart heart
[37:23] heart soul not
[37:25] your everybody with me
[37:28] so that's the part Satan if you're born
[37:30] again that's why you have eternal life
[37:33] Satan can't get eternal life he's wanted
[37:36] it from the beginning that's why he's
[37:38] got such a chip on his shoulder against
[37:42] you and God he wanted eternal life he
[37:46] wanted to be able to create and he
[37:49] couldn't oh let me do no Satan just stay
[37:52] right oh no Lucifer stay right here
[37:55] that's why we need to stay in our
[37:56] position yes sir know your position stay
[37:59] in it and God's good with
[38:01] that brother R said direct quote there
[38:04] scrap peaps of ministers that goes out
[38:06] beyond the program of
[38:10] God and they r on side the road and
[38:13] that's what's happened to a lot of
[38:14] people but they ain't got a lot to do
[38:16] with the church age so let's just
[38:17] continue on here but here's the church
[38:20] ages and I hope you can see that but we
[38:22] went Paul irenius Martin Columba Luther
[38:25] we're now at John Wesley number six
[38:28] which is the Philadelphian
[38:30] age excuse me and remember the black of
[38:34] that is the Blackness of the age and
[38:37] then you see the white which is the holy
[38:39] ghost in the age are what the anointed
[38:41] word for their time amen everybody with
[38:44] me the anointed word for their time is
[38:46] the
[38:48] white amen okay it's the
[38:51] white this is the darkness of Satan this
[38:54] is false Doctrine
[38:57] right just like I said in in
[39:00] Tennessee I need to start preaching
[39:02] other places I get 50 views here when I
[39:04] preach and I got 200 and something when
[39:06] I preached up there so go figure and
[39:09] then if you put a real nice title on it
[39:11] like they did with Bobs he gets about
[39:12] 200 views too so it's ACC to what you do
[39:15] you know they going to look at me and
[39:16] say oh son of man number 185 okay we'll
[39:18] listen to that later but oh the one God
[39:22] in The Bride of Jesus Christ will listen
[39:24] to that
[39:25] one people are funny but
[39:29] anyway that's that's false Doctrine see
[39:32] how there's not much then it gets more
[39:34] more more a little bit less a little bit
[39:37] less and then remember in this age right
[39:40] here brother bram's the one that put
[39:41] that in there he said the last Church
[39:44] age was completely
[39:46] dark I put a little light in it which is
[39:50] who is that me and you it's me and you
[39:53] sir you know what that is right there
[39:55] that's Grace that's that God sent a
[39:58] prophet to be in you and that we
[40:00] accepted the message which is the true
[40:01] message which is the right
[40:04] message only only message thank you
[40:07] brother
[40:08] preach but remember all these we see the
[40:11] circles and we see what brother Ryan
[40:13] preach it all comes down to a woman
[40:17] right in the Garden of Eden the woman
[40:20] showed dominance over the
[40:22] man everybody with me all right and
[40:26] that's the way Satan got in and you know
[40:28] what that's the way he's going to carry
[40:29] his his all the way through he's going
[40:31] to get into church and be a dominating
[40:34] female and dominate any Doctrine as as
[40:37] somebody was speaking I guess with
[40:39] brother Bob about the dress of of our
[40:43] sisters that dominating spirit is so
[40:46] dominant to they don't want to be
[40:48] submissive anymore they don't want to
[40:51] wear the correct clothes anymore and
[40:54] don't tell them they need to wear the
[40:56] right clothes anymore don't tell me and
[40:59] that's what they did in the in the
[41:00] church ages man got behind the pull pit
[41:03] and said don't tell
[41:04] me XYZ whatever it is and that Doctrine
[41:09] formulated through the devil from a
[41:12] dominating Church female Church listen
[41:15] we are the Church of Jesus Christ but we
[41:17] are not dominating over our
[41:20] head we are under our headship which is
[41:22] Christ we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[41:25] brother rown said we're not the church
[41:28] we're the bride and the bride that knows
[41:30] what she's doing is submissive to her
[41:32] mate she's submissive to her husband
[41:35] everybody with me okay so the dominating
[41:40] female or the church is where all the
[41:42] doctrines as we were talking about in
[41:43] Tennessee when when when we see the
[41:46] seals released it's always got to do
[41:48] with Doctrine it's always got to do with
[41:50] a message it's always got it comes from
[41:52] right
[41:53] here amen why did Brother random in
[41:57] marriage and
[41:58] divorce he didn't have to preach that
[42:00] sermon to tell us how to get married and
[42:02] how to get divorced the Bible tells us
[42:04] that all right is everybody with me he
[42:07] didn't have to do that it was already
[42:08] but it had been
[42:09] misinterpreted so many times yes sir so
[42:13] you can do this and you can do this and
[42:14] you can do this he said because he said
[42:16] we find ourself in this situation
[42:19] because of
[42:21] misinterpreted theology sir right here
[42:25] this is where theology comes from right
[42:28] and if we had a lot more neology we'd
[42:31] come back to
[42:33] theology that's wrong but he said
[42:36] because of that we're in this shape
[42:38] we're in but praise God about three
[42:41] sentences at the end of that
[42:43] service he said but I say to
[42:46] you he said don't do it no more go on as
[42:49] you are there's the grace there's the
[42:53] grace that we're looking for to know
[42:55] that God knew listen God knew we was
[42:56] going to get messed up up yes he did not
[42:58] brother Brown tell us that God knew if
[43:01] he put us in human flesh we would fall
[43:04] that's right and all that other stuff
[43:06] that goes with it so he used the fall
[43:09] still though by sex to get you here by
[43:12] permissive will absolutely right amen
[43:16] coming right back yes to the Garden of
[43:19] Eden the where we're supposed to be
[43:20] that's what we're doing we're eating our
[43:22] way back to that Garden listen God put
[43:25] the chasm there he's got to be the one
[43:27] that fills it in to get us back to that
[43:30] amen he said look right he said look he
[43:33] said he said I'm going to put a division
[43:34] or enmity between me and you you're not
[43:36] going to be able to talk to me anymore
[43:37] like you used to you're going to you're
[43:40] going to hear me through the teachings
[43:42] of this and the teaching of that
[43:43] teachings of Moses teachings of Abraham
[43:45] and all these different ones everybody
[43:47] with me amen but now there's a time
[43:49] right now though we've come back to this
[43:51] to where God is now speaking back again
[43:55] he's trying to get us cleaned up enough
[43:57] yes to talk to
[44:00] us everybody with
[44:04] me cuz God won't dwell in an unclean
[44:07] vessel that's
[44:09] right so the Earth opening of the first
[44:12] three seals loosed a Ministry there was
[44:14] a Ministry looed true and a Ministry
[44:18] loosed false
[44:21] amen cuz here stands a lamb with the
[44:23] book watch that book that book is
[44:26] eternal life
[44:28] that book is the Bible that book is
[44:32] truth and the man that wrote it had it
[44:34] in his
[44:36] hand and the man that possessed it had
[44:39] in his
[44:40] hand right but he said here stands a
[44:43] lamb with a book in his hand and there
[44:45] goes a white horse rider this ministry
[44:47] was loosed and so was that one cuz
[44:50] remember in every in every instance it's
[44:53] twins yes right every instance it's
[44:55] twins can and abble we proved that the
[44:57] other day Jesus and Judas and even right
[45:00] now you're going to have Christ and
[45:02] Antichrist right here in the end time
[45:04] one the epitomy of Christ the other the
[45:06] epitome of antichrist all right so it's
[45:08] coming to a head today yes sir yes
[45:12] amen open our eyes so the opening of the
[45:15] first three seals Loos the ministry so
[45:17] that Ministry was so strong though it
[45:19] was so powerful it was in the lion
[45:21] anointing l i o n the lion roared they
[45:25] had they didn't have a Baptist on every
[45:27] every corner or a Methodist or a
[45:28] Pentecostal or a bromite church on every
[45:32] corner they had the word of God they
[45:36] taught it right straight Jesus give it
[45:38] to them straight out of his
[45:40] mouth so guess what we're doing if that
[45:43] did it to them there it's going to do
[45:44] the same thing to me and you here that's
[45:46] why we had to have a prophet that was
[45:48] the mouthpiece of God that spoke to us
[45:52] by the word of God through the word of
[45:54] God With God telling them what to Happ
[45:58] and a lot of times it wasn't brother
[45:59] Brown speaking
[46:04] anyway but he promised he would restore
[46:06] and that's what we've been talking about
[46:07] from all the church ages back to here
[46:09] that there had to be a time that there
[46:11] was a group of
[46:13] people that had the pure word of God and
[46:16] then like I said before doctrines got
[46:19] loosed Ministries got Loos by the White
[46:21] Horse by the Red Horse by the by the
[46:23] Black Horse and by The Pale Horse there
[46:25] was Ministries Loos and and it remember
[46:27] it kept it started as a white righteous
[46:28] church so it what it would get the
[46:29] attention of the
[46:31] people oh it's white oh it seems
[46:34] right then what seemed Right started
[46:38] killing people right physically killing
[46:41] them then that Doctrine became incarnate
[46:43] in a pope and it started spiritually
[46:45] killing the people and that's what's
[46:47] happening now in this age they're
[46:50] spiritually dying because of false
[46:53] Doctrine that's right or the loosing of
[46:56] a Ministry that was not true but God
[46:58] promised praise God I will restore he
[47:01] didn't say you he said I'll restore he
[47:03] didn't say Satan's going to restore he
[47:05] said I will restore those years in other
[47:08] words I will pay those years back I will
[47:10] what redeem the time that all this got
[47:15] lost he's redeeming it
[47:19] now so the first three ages pure word of
[47:22] God the fourth Church age went into the
[47:25] ground remember it was just to be a
[47:27] Christian you were
[47:28] killed all
[47:30] right wasn't a whole lot of uh healings
[47:33] and and worldwide campaigns and not no
[47:36] you lived a Christian Life you were in
[47:38] that Ox age you B you you were a burden
[47:41] Bearer you just kept going and kept
[47:42] going and basically 68 million of them
[47:45] died
[47:47] amen so then the fourth Church
[47:50] age went in the ground as we were
[47:53] talking about but Jesus
[47:55] Promised here in in the Bible in John 12
[47:58] he said Jesus answered and said the hour
[47:59] has come that the son of man should be
[48:01] glorified now remember who is the son of
[48:04] man God in human
[48:07] flesh everybody with me now according to
[48:10] a prophet and according to the different
[48:13] pieces in the Bible that same son of man
[48:16] is supposed to come back in the end time
[48:18] in a group of people yes sir now he
[48:20] promised it we didn't he promised it
[48:22] amen amen cuz remember Satan didn't know
[48:26] anything to do with Jesus he he he
[48:28] couldn't he couldn't stick his as
[48:30] brother B said he stuck the Stinger into
[48:32] his flesh and he died well the Stinger's
[48:35] gone
[48:37] now so Satan don't know how he didn't
[48:39] know how to deal with Jesus if he's
[48:41] still here again as the son of man
[48:43] that's why the ministry's got to be
[48:45] right that's why the doctrine's got to
[48:46] be right that's why everything's got to
[48:48] be online so Satan can't get his grubby
[48:51] hands on you and me and he won't when we
[48:53] take a body change when we take a body
[48:55] change he has not got any on you at all
[48:58] right now he has a hold on your flesh
[49:01] that's right cuz you are dying and he
[49:04] does have a hold partly on your brain
[49:06] because some of you are asleep not
[49:07] listening to what I'm saying and some
[49:10] some of you are cooking supper brother
[49:12] Brandon one time he he stopped he said
[49:14] he said now wait a minute sisters
[49:16] discernment he said wait a minute
[49:18] sisters I believe it spoken words R seed
[49:20] he said your beans won't
[49:21] burn I believe it spoke a word Original
[49:24] Seed he said all right now you your bean
[49:25] your your stuffer your food food won't
[49:27] burn now sister just hang on a minute he
[49:29] he picked that
[49:30] up cuz that's what you're thinking now
[49:33] you've got you know 75 80 people in here
[49:36] right now about 75 different maybe a few
[49:39] of y'all are paying attention but 75 you
[49:42] got all kind of different ideas going
[49:43] around the
[49:46] place well me too cuz I just had a
[49:48] thought right then wasn't good so very I
[49:52] saying to you except the corn of wheat
[49:54] fall into the ground and die it abide us
[50:00] alone God had to let that fourth age go
[50:03] in the ground and die to bring forth the
[50:06] true seed now not that they were false
[50:10] they were true seed but they had to go
[50:13] into the ground and die so the son of
[50:15] man can resurrect in the end time
[50:18] because remember who's he talking
[50:20] about he's talking about himself right
[50:22] here in this instant dual meaning now
[50:25] remember he talking about himself he's
[50:29] the corn of
[50:31] wheat that fell into the
[50:33] ground the son of man not the Son of God
[50:37] see Son of God can't die son of man this
[50:40] is God standing here in human flesh
[50:42] saying that the son of man is going to
[50:45] be glorified all right if he's going to
[50:47] be glorified who's he going to be
[50:49] glorified in you or a group of people
[50:52] coming that Satan don't know have
[50:54] anything to do with
[50:57] that's why he hates us he don't know
[50:58] what to do with us I say again if you
[51:00] got eternal life in your soul he listen
[51:03] he resided there one
[51:07] time sorry about
[51:09] that you were Satan's subject at one
[51:12] time you did what the devil wanted you
[51:15] to do he wanted you to do that's right
[51:18] well pray for me I was that
[51:20] way I'm just plain enough that I was
[51:23] lost and I was doing what lost things
[51:27] cuz you know what when you become a
[51:28] Christian you do Christian things so
[51:30] when you become stay lost you become you
[51:32] do lost things all right so now that
[51:34] we're all on the same
[51:35] level that corn of wheat Jesus Christ
[51:38] had to Die the son of man had to die but
[51:40] remember he resurrected yes that flesh
[51:43] that son of man but now remember he said
[51:46] look the world's not going to see me
[51:47] anymore all right see me right anymore
[51:52] but you'll see me yes sir cuz I'll be
[51:54] with you even in you yes sir what in you
[51:58] in your
[51:59] flesh till the end of the world and
[52:03] we're standing right here at the at the
[52:04] threshold look what's going on look
[52:06] what's going on in the world horrible
[52:09] horrible everywhere you
[52:11] look Hallelujah so except the corn of
[52:15] wheat fall on the ground and die that
[52:18] was those people in that fourth Church
[52:19] age they died by the million 68
[52:23] million died during that time under rule
[52:27] of Christianity supposed to
[52:30] be now Untold billions as brother Brown
[52:34] said spiritually died because listen you
[52:38] can be sitting here today and be dead as
[52:39] a hammer oh yes sir you can sit here
[52:42] today and be Just As Dead As Dead can be
[52:47] amen but let's not be that way let's be
[52:50] alive you can only be alive in Christ
[52:53] you can't be alive in the devil you
[52:54] can't be alive in your own self you
[52:56] woohoo I'm alive no you're
[52:59] dead right as they say before they're
[53:02] fixing to take the people to the
[53:04] electric chair you're dead while you're
[53:05] walking dead man
[53:07] walking that's what we
[53:10] were but thank God Christ took our place
[53:13] sir he went in there and took our place
[53:15] for us he got executed for
[53:19] us to come back the seed that come the
[53:22] corn come back and not just coming back
[53:25] one he came back in multiple forms 120
[53:29] 3,000 hundreds of thousands millions of
[53:32] little
[53:34] jesuses that's what the word of God does
[53:36] we sit here at the end time now though
[53:37] we are coming to seed head time right
[53:42] you can't plant a stock you can't plant
[53:45] a
[53:47] leaf you can't plant a
[53:49] flower and it come up sure you can plant
[53:52] it it's not going to come up you can
[53:55] even plant PL hybrid seed in the ground
[53:57] and it might come up one time but it'll
[54:00] never reproduce
[54:01] itself that's what Satan's done he's
[54:04] planted a
[54:05] seed and planting that
[54:07] seed we're sitting
[54:10] here and serpent seed unless we're born
[54:12] again that's what brother random said
[54:15] born between Satan and Eve so that's
[54:17] where we were between Satan and Eve that
[54:18] kind of puts you in a precarious
[54:23] predicament but thank God for Grace
[54:26] thank God for the cross thank God for
[54:28] Calvary thank God for resurrection that
[54:31] corn came out of the ground and he said
[54:32] all power in heaven Earth been given
[54:35] unto me yes and I'm giving it to you go
[54:39] into the world come on preach the gospel
[54:42] baptize in the name of the father and
[54:44] the Son and the Holy Ghost my name he
[54:47] said praise God where was I so the fifth
[54:52] age was an age of reformation now
[54:54] remember that was
[54:56] Martin Luther he come out of the
[54:59] Catholic church but a lot of the
[55:01] Catholic Church came out with him there
[55:02] was still some Darkness there listen not
[55:04] in his soul
[55:06] though but it was so in his Spirit realm
[55:10] till he took some of that with him CU
[55:11] remember if you're born again like I
[55:13] said before if you're born again think
[55:15] about this your soul is perfect yes you
[55:19] can't put false Doctrine in your soul
[55:21] that's why we need to listen to our soul
[55:23] more than we listen to our spirit or
[55:25] listen to any other thing that's going
[55:26] on listen to that one inside of you and
[55:28] if that thing doesn't resonate with the
[55:30] word you got the wrong
[55:33] one you got the wrong person that's
[55:36] right Satan can't cast out Satan
[55:41] right everybody with
[55:44] me at fifth Church age it was a
[55:47] reforming age now what is a reformer a
[55:50] reformer is like somebody that's a drug
[55:52] addict that you take and put them in a
[55:54] reformed place or used to be when you
[55:56] were really bad they put you in a
[55:58] reformed school they tried to reform you
[56:02] they didn't try to change you yeah they
[56:03] tried to change you but they didn't try
[56:05] to change the right
[56:07] man you got to have a soul change to be
[56:11] different right soul change to be
[56:16] different like I said before you can be
[56:18] anointed on your spirit realm and still
[56:21] be black as sun in the inside somewhere
[56:24] that thing's going to pop his head up
[56:26] somewhere that something's going to
[56:27] happen in your life and you're going to
[56:29] go I may not have what I got what I
[56:32] thought I had we're going to get to that
[56:35] in just a few minutes then we'll we'll
[56:37] wait till the rest of it this afternoon
[56:39] because there's a lot here that I'm
[56:40] going to have to to uh cut out but now
[56:42] the sixth age is what we're talking
[56:44] about all right the first age was the
[56:47] sardian church age it was the age of
[56:51] justification everybody understand that
[56:54] justification chops off your your past
[56:56] sins it makes you just for the
[57:03] moment it makes you just for the
[57:07] moment all right chopped off your past
[57:09] sins and I was telling them in in
[57:11] Tennessee that most of y'all were there
[57:13] you know God created a place that he
[57:15] can't even go
[57:16] to did y'all think of that when I said
[57:18] that God created a place that he can't
[57:21] even go
[57:23] himself that's right he created a sea
[57:26] that's right he created a place in his
[57:28] mind come
[57:30] on that's so covered by the blood he
[57:33] can't go in there that's right remember
[57:36] the Bible says he put in the sea of
[57:37] God's forgetfulness and he'll never
[57:40] remember it again am so there's a place
[57:43] that you say my God can do everything
[57:44] there's one thing I know he can't do and
[57:47] praise God he can't accuse me of my past
[57:50] sins that ought to make you happy or
[57:53] either you hadn't been Justified yet
[57:56] that's right truly Justified truly not
[57:59] got
[58:01] caught or Found Jesus in
[58:04] jail but really find God and say God I'm
[58:07] done I'm finished I'm tired of being
[58:10] tired I'm tired of being a slave to the
[58:12] devil I want a new life well you don't
[58:16] get one right then folks I'm telling you
[58:17] cuz you're still
[58:19] rotten in sanctification you're still in
[58:22] that Spirit realm you have that same
[58:24] motivator that there has been before
[58:26] it's just that the you're God in some
[58:29] way I say in some way I know what way
[58:31] it's because of the sea of forgetfulness
[58:33] God forgets all that and where it used
[58:35] to be that you had your sins recorded
[58:37] and all were written down well all of a
[58:39] sudden you got a clean slate yes sir
[58:41] amen and brother B I'm going tell us
[58:43] that's where a lot of people get and
[58:45] they don't go no further
[58:47] amen the Baptist once saved always saved
[58:50] I believe that if you start acting like
[58:52] a Christian but if you get saved at 5
[58:53] years old and you don't darken the door
[58:55] of a church for 45 or 50 years and you
[58:58] live like the devil no you're not going
[59:01] to
[59:04] heaven I believe once truly born again
[59:07] yes sir no doubt you'll never get unborn
[59:09] again how can you unbirth yourself
[59:13] naturally that's what Nicodemus he said
[59:16] do I have to go make myself a baby again
[59:19] and go back into you know reverse the
[59:21] process and go back into my mother's
[59:23] womb Jesus said Nicodemus you ought to
[59:25] know
[59:26] better but he didn't we know he didn't
[59:29] cuz what he was looking at the law he
[59:31] was looking at what the law
[59:33] said there was no redemption in the
[59:36] law that's why Paul said sure it's
[59:39] coming to that and they were redeemed
[59:41] when Christ died at Calvary but when you
[59:44] if you brother brandham said he said
[59:46] they put the sacrifice down they lay
[59:48] their hands on it if they were an
[59:50] adultery he said they got forgiven for
[59:51] the year past he said but they walked
[59:53] out with the same devil that they walked
[59:55] in with
[59:56] cuz the blood of bulls and goats only
[59:58] covers sin it didn't eradicate it but
[1:00:03] the blood of Jesus
[1:00:04] Christ it will eradicate your
[1:00:07] sins so justification is a one-step
[1:00:12] process to begin with we know there's
[1:00:14] other parts but to begin with by faith
[1:00:16] in what Christ did at the cross you got
[1:00:18] to believe that your sins are not marked
[1:00:23] somewhere the sins of your past nature
[1:00:26] it gone Romans
[1:00:28] 3:22 even the righteousness of God which
[1:00:31] is by faith of Jesus Christ unto
[1:00:34] all and upon all them that believe
[1:00:37] there's no difference for all have
[1:00:39] sinned all right Paul what are you
[1:00:42] talking about for all everybody say all
[1:00:46] all have sinned those of you all that
[1:00:48] didn't you must not have
[1:00:51] sinned for all have
[1:00:54] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:00:59] God being justified freely by his grace
[1:01:03] and only through his
[1:01:05] grace through the Redemption that is in
[1:01:08] Christ Jesus not the law whom God has
[1:01:12] set forth to be a perpetuation through
[1:01:14] faith in his blood to declare what we're
[1:01:18] declaring today he is righteous but now
[1:01:21] in turn him being righteous turned
[1:01:23] around and said so are you right that's
[1:01:26] right hu y'all don't believe that do you
[1:01:29] not believe that he said so are
[1:01:32] you he said Paul said you are the
[1:01:34] righteousness in Christ Jesus to declare
[1:01:38] his righteousness today when you sit
[1:01:40] here and say amen and you live a
[1:01:41] Christian Life you have declared his
[1:01:44] righteousness but it now becomes
[1:01:48] yours to declare his righteousness for
[1:01:51] the remission of sins that are passed
[1:01:55] now listen you can't come up today and
[1:01:58] be prayed for and say brother Wade I
[1:02:00] know I'm going to murder somebody
[1:02:02] tomorrow I want you to forgive
[1:02:04] me or I know I'm going to get mad at my
[1:02:07] boss I know that well probably you're
[1:02:12] right but I want to get forgiveness now
[1:02:14] you can't do that there is no there's
[1:02:16] nothing in there for that it's sins past
[1:02:19] that's right listen Grace is not what
[1:02:21] you're going to do it's not for what
[1:02:24] you're going to do it's for what you've
[1:02:25] already done all right everybody with me
[1:02:29] look through the forbearance of God is
[1:02:31] everybody with me today to declare now
[1:02:33] here's Paul to declare I say at this
[1:02:36] time his righteousness now watch that he
[1:02:39] might be
[1:02:40] just got to have one person that's just
[1:02:44] but he's the justifier of put your name
[1:02:47] in
[1:02:48] there which believeth in
[1:02:51] Jesus where is boasting then it is
[1:02:54] excluded by what law La of Works
[1:02:57] no but by the law of
[1:03:01] Faith therefore we conclude now here's
[1:03:03] Paul the great Paul he brings it all to
[1:03:05] one one one sentence therefore we
[1:03:08] conclude that a man is justified by
[1:03:10] faith without the Deeds of the law
[1:03:14] remember we went through that the law
[1:03:16] kills you because the law said you kill
[1:03:18] somebody we're going to kill you you
[1:03:20] have an adultery with my wife we're
[1:03:22] going to kill you you have this we're
[1:03:24] going to kill you everything was about
[1:03:25] kill
[1:03:26] killing well praise God there was a
[1:03:29] killing one time 2,000 years ago and he
[1:03:31] didn't have to take another one he's the
[1:03:33] only one and he's the one that died for
[1:03:35] me and you if we ever forget Calvary and
[1:03:38] forget what Jesus done for us God help
[1:03:41] us amen sometime we get so revelated in
[1:03:44] the message till we forget about Jesus
[1:03:46] Christ Jesus Christ is the message his
[1:03:49] Redemption and his grace is what give us
[1:03:52] the opportunity to be here today amen
[1:03:55] right so now let's look for just a
[1:03:57] moment we'll get to sanctification this
[1:03:59] afternoon this is the you can't really
[1:04:02] see it but let me get to the next one I
[1:04:04] think you'll be able to see

[1:04:21] look you walk into this court now you
[1:04:23] walk into this court that is a type of
[1:04:27] what
[1:04:28] justification everybody with me uh when
[1:04:31] it rains you get wet when it gets hot
[1:04:34] you get hot but in here is where you
[1:04:36] start sacrificing working your way to

[1:04:56] said give it to
[1:04:58] me that's pretty powerful for one man to
[1:05:02] say give me your
[1:05:04] sins and there's Bill Seven 8 billion
[1:05:07] people in this world but if every person
[1:05:09] in this world like brother Dale said if
[1:05:11] every person in this world today
[1:05:13] declared and got the new birth God
[1:05:15] wouldn't be going wait a minute let sit
[1:05:17] down on this one no he'd be way be
[1:05:20] stronger that's what's going to be in
[1:05:22] that new city come on somebody that new
[1:05:25] city going to be nothing but Eternal
[1:05:27] people that's why it's going to be
[1:05:28] something you can't understand cuz we
[1:05:30] are not in it
[1:05:34] now all right so this is the outer
[1:05:38] court all right even they have a place
[1:05:41] I've been reading up on this and we may
[1:05:43] do it later on they have a place called
[1:05:44] The Women's
[1:05:47] court and it's a corner over here like
[1:05:49] this now that's in not this is one in
[1:05:51] the wilderness they took up and went but
[1:05:53] when they had Solomon's Temple it was a
[1:05:55] little different cuz it was in one place
[1:05:57] but don't worry about that but it is a
[1:05:58] part people can even this is called the
[1:06:00] court of the Gentiles Gentiles could
[1:06:02] walk in here right right all right so
[1:06:05] what am I saying justification it chops
[1:06:07] off your past sins but it doesn't do
[1:06:10] anything for the continuation of your
[1:06:13] life if you turn around and walk back
[1:06:17] out you're just as dead as you was when
[1:06:19] you walked
[1:06:21] in but if you continue walking I hope y
[1:06:25] get some of
[1:06:27] that brother you shout hard these people
[1:06:29] don't do
[1:06:33] that Hallelujah makes you happy doesn't
[1:06:36] it amen but the six Church age though we
[1:06:40] move up a little higher and we'll talk
[1:06:42] about it this afternoon it's called
[1:06:45] sanctification now what is
[1:06:48] sanctification sanctification is you've
[1:06:51] made it through here you've made it
[1:06:53] through this is the Laver and the ball
[1:06:55] and a sacrifice and you made it through
[1:06:58] there and you're heading in here now
[1:06:59] look once you start into here come on a
[1:07:02] lot of people can't go in
[1:07:06] there just a a common person can't walk
[1:07:09] in there and certain ones of this that's
[1:07:12] been defiled boy I read something I'm
[1:07:14] going to read it this afternoon and it
[1:07:16] always bothered me the same way like
[1:07:18] with brother brandham and even with the
[1:07:19] people with when Jesus was eating the
[1:07:21] corn remember he was eating the corn in
[1:07:23] the corners and the priest come out and
[1:07:24] said hey what are you doing all this he
[1:07:27] said did not even
[1:07:29] David eat the shoe bread that was
[1:07:33] separated for the priest you know the
[1:07:34] shoe Bread's in here and you know what I
[1:07:37] always thought I always thought I
[1:07:40] thought shoe bread was Mana it's
[1:07:42] not it ain't even close to Mana right
[1:07:46] it's something the preach well thank you
[1:07:47] brother you should have told me that a
[1:07:48] long time ago I'm sorry
[1:07:51] okay get with it brother I need help
[1:07:55] but the shoe bread was made by the
[1:07:57] priest made by human hands that's right
[1:08:01] but when you went into the holy of
[1:08:03] holies when we ever get there there was
[1:08:05] Mana in there that never that was L
[1:08:08] listen that Mana was made in God's
[1:08:10] Kitchen yes sir that Mana was produced
[1:08:13] by God himself and when he put it in
[1:08:15] there he put it in
[1:08:17] you cuz Mana is the top of the what Holy
[1:08:20] Ghost but when you get ready to walk
[1:08:22] into that next Veil and that Veil drops
[1:08:24] there's certain things in there we'll
[1:08:26] talk about this afternoon but I want to
[1:08:27] get to one thing as we start into
[1:08:30] sanctification you with
[1:08:33] me so the sixth age is the age that John
[1:08:40] Wesley how you want to say this moved up
[1:08:42] in God a little
[1:08:44] more right he was born again but there
[1:08:48] was things that he lacked remember the
[1:08:50] moravians and all the different ones
[1:08:52] that he that uh uh sometimes we think
[1:08:55] that
[1:08:56] sometimes we think that all these these
[1:08:57] Church age Messengers they just you know
[1:08:59] they're
[1:09:01] like no John Wesley didn't know he was
[1:09:04] not born again until he met somebody
[1:09:06] that
[1:09:07] was the moravians he met them and said I
[1:09:11] don't have what they got remember his
[1:09:14] brother Charles he come back and said
[1:09:15] hey Charles we ain't got one Charles you
[1:09:17] know he's a little bit
[1:09:20] ill child said brother you built your
[1:09:22] whole life on this and you're telling me
[1:09:25] you ain't born again he said that's
[1:09:26] exactly right that's what brother DS
[1:09:28] always said he said I pray that
[1:09:30] everybody in this building realizes
[1:09:32] they're not born
[1:09:33] again that God can do something to help
[1:09:39] you all right we'll get to this later on
[1:09:41] I want to get to something right here it
[1:09:43] was called love of the brethren we know
[1:09:44] all that has a little strength and it
[1:09:46] but it remember it was an unfulfilled
[1:09:47] age also because remember it was the
[1:09:50] outer Court inner Court you're not in
[1:09:52] the holy of holies
[1:09:53] yet but it is getting there is called
[1:09:55] the holy
[1:09:56] Place sanctification folks is called in
[1:10:00] your life the holy place is when you
[1:10:02] start learning to come to
[1:10:05] church you start learning to read your
[1:10:08] Bible you start learning the things
[1:10:10] about God and what he does in his ways
[1:10:13] and his attitude we're going to talk
[1:10:15] about that in just a
[1:10:16] second so John Wesley was
[1:10:19] the pastor or the messenger he died in
[1:10:22] 1791 so the church age continued on to
[1:10:25] 19 1906 and remember brother Joe's he's
[1:10:28] in the back but we were at that
[1:10:30] Methodist camp this weekend and and I
[1:10:33] showed him in the book cuz I'd read it
[1:10:34] before they have their own Himel
[1:10:36] methodists they have their own Himel and
[1:10:39] in the beginning of it it tells you
[1:10:40] exactly what to do step by step what
[1:10:44] songs to sing how to sing them sing them
[1:10:47] with Zeal it says I mean and Joe was
[1:10:49] over just taking pictures of it I said I
[1:10:50] told you it was in here tells you how to
[1:10:52] do everything why because that's why
[1:10:54] they're called methodists cuz it was a
[1:10:56] method of worship that that that even
[1:10:59] Martin Luther didn't do now Martin
[1:11:01] Luther tried to have worship Services
[1:11:05] apart from just somebody speaking in
[1:11:07] Latin and you listening to what he you
[1:11:09] can't understand what he says but then
[1:11:10] John Wesley comes out and says hey
[1:11:12] there's a method of worship here and you
[1:11:15] know what God was happy with
[1:11:20] that cuz even brother brandham Condor
[1:11:23] and Doctrine he said do this do this do
[1:11:27] this do
[1:11:29] this God don't
[1:11:31] change if he brought it to Martin Luther
[1:11:34] if he brought it to John Wesley he
[1:11:36] brought the same thing to brother Brown
[1:11:37] the only problem is they weren't
[1:11:40] prophets they CAU pieces of the mind of
[1:11:43] God right they didn't catch the whole
[1:11:46] Mind Of God listen when a man stands in
[1:11:48] a pull pit and he says let's go back
[1:11:51] into the back part of the mind of God
[1:11:54] yes that's a place the devil's never
[1:11:57] been John Wesley didn't get there Martin
[1:12:00] Luther didn't get there but brother Bram
[1:12:02] said
[1:12:03] let's he didn't say
[1:12:05] I he said let's go back what's he doing
[1:12:09] he's pulling us into
[1:12:10] it oh that was just for brother Brown no
[1:12:13] no no no no no that was for all of us he
[1:12:16] took us into the mind of God that's what
[1:12:18] the message is the message is a mind of
[1:12:21] God Amen everybody with
[1:12:23] me listen we'll get into sanctification
[1:12:26] this evening all right this
[1:12:29] afternoon if you don't come back you'll
[1:12:31] miss
[1:12:35] something well people want to know where
[1:12:37] God is he'll be here at 2 o' this
[1:12:40] afternoon the devil will too but greater
[1:12:44] is he that is in Me Greater is he that
[1:12:47] is in me all right now look Luther in
[1:12:50] the church age of bringing forth the
[1:12:51] bride seed was the same in spirit now
[1:12:53] watch but just one little grain of seed
[1:12:56] Luther stood out then what the two
[1:12:58] little shoots right justification by
[1:13:01] faith he was the very type of Hagar the
[1:13:03] stalk coming up Wesley was the type of
[1:13:06] Sarah the Philadelphia the age of love
[1:13:09] that brought forth the tassel that in
[1:13:11] Wesley's age there was more missionaries
[1:13:13] than any other age we've had the great
[1:13:14] missionary age of John Wesley but
[1:13:16] Pentecost represented Mary that's what
[1:13:18] we're going to get to there'll be a
[1:13:19] Pentecostal age after we get finished
[1:13:21] with this one this is the age of
[1:13:23] sanctification the one coming up is the
[1:13:24] age of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:13:27] then what is the Lan age it's the age of
[1:13:29] the word of God coming back into Power
[1:13:32] the Omega Church coming back into
[1:13:35] Power it's
[1:13:37] matured so sanctification is what
[1:13:39] cleaned up and set assign for use or
[1:13:42] purpose all right everybody with me just
[1:13:44] for a minute we'll close remember the
[1:13:46] glass God picked the glass up he picked
[1:13:48] it up because he was justly gonna use it
[1:13:51] then it was really dirty so he started
[1:13:53] cleaning it out but remember
[1:13:55] justification is one
[1:13:57] act watch you hear one act oh I'm going
[1:14:00] to use that one act what's
[1:14:03] sanctification I got to open it I got to
[1:14:06] take it in the kitchen I got to put
[1:14:09] detergent in it and I got to scrub it
[1:14:11] out so it's a process all right
[1:14:14] sanctification is a process we're still
[1:14:16] going through it Paul said I Die
[1:14:19] daily so as a process sanctification
[1:14:22] means becoming more holy Through Time
[1:14:25] right like a child growing up into
[1:14:28] adulthood Christians become more
[1:14:29] Sanctified over time and that's the
[1:14:32] truth that's that's why this right here
[1:14:34] right it
[1:14:35] stages this means that Christians should
[1:14:38] expect to make
[1:14:40] progress
[1:14:42] hello grow and become more
[1:14:46] loving
[1:14:47] kind wake
[1:14:49] up because this is I'm talking to you
[1:14:52] yes more loving kind humble and
[1:14:57] self-controlled over their
[1:15:02] life Jesus said sanctify them through
[1:15:04] thy truth Thy word is truth now watch
[1:15:07] what brother R
[1:15:10] said my dear Methodist brother in
[1:15:12] Pilgrim Holiness and Nazarene the
[1:15:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost is different
[1:15:16] from
[1:15:17] sanctification sanctification is the
[1:15:19] cleansing which is
[1:15:21] preparation of life that's right now not
[1:15:25] life preparation of
[1:15:28] life but when the Holy Ghost comes it is
[1:15:32] life preparation is cleaning the vessel
[1:15:36] the Holy Ghost is filling the vessel
[1:15:38] sanctification mean cleans and set aside
[1:15:40] for service the holy spirit is put into
[1:15:42] service you are the vessel that God's
[1:15:45] cleaned
[1:15:46] up how can I overcome brother R said
[1:15:48] look we notice when the unclean Spirit
[1:15:50] has gone from a man he walks in dry
[1:15:52] places that's exactly what the church
[1:15:54] has done Baptist Methodist those who
[1:15:56] believed in sanctification then Jesus
[1:15:58] said the unclean spirit that went out
[1:16:00] returns back to this church
[1:16:03] body huh and finds the house garnish
[1:16:06] swept clean living Pure Clean lives all
[1:16:08] right but then if that house isn't
[1:16:10] filled occupied then he comes in with
[1:16:12] seven other evil demons worse than he
[1:16:15] was and the last stage of this place is
[1:16:17] seven times worse as it was at the
[1:16:20] first they had been better to have
[1:16:22] stayed Lutheran than it would be to
[1:16:23] receive that light and fail to follow it
[1:16:27] I'm talking to you
[1:16:28] today so will the Pentecostal see you
[1:16:31] know what I mean the house is garnished
[1:16:34] returned back found the house not filled
[1:16:35] with the Holy Spirit now the state of
[1:16:37] the church is joined with the league of
[1:16:39] churches World Council of churches and
[1:16:41] it's a state now that connects it with
[1:16:43] Roman Catholicism and all the rest of it
[1:16:45] listen forget about this Trump Biden all
[1:16:47] this junk they're
[1:16:50] garbage they're all garbage you better
[1:16:52] watch Rome you better watch what the
[1:16:55] Catholic church is doing underneath you
[1:16:56] better wor what we ain't heard from Pope
[1:16:58] in a long time why he's formulating his
[1:17:02] plan and whoever's in the white house
[1:17:04] that's part of his plan you know why
[1:17:07] though that's part of God's plan
[1:17:09] though I put in Kings I take Kings
[1:17:13] out and now it's seven times worse than
[1:17:15] it was when it come out of Lutheranism
[1:17:17] that's where man takes it now real
[1:17:21] quick Christianity is not based
[1:17:25] on what people do to
[1:17:28] you think about that this is my last
[1:17:30] statement right here Christianity is not
[1:17:34] based on what people do to you and it's
[1:17:37] not based on a condition right everybody

[1:17:43] thing y'all going to say well

[1:24:03] Sinners also love those that love
[1:24:06] them aren't we supposed to be Christians
[1:24:08] aren't we supposed to be above that yes
[1:24:10] aren't we supposed to be somebody that
[1:24:12] walks and talks different that somebody
[1:24:13] can see a
[1:24:16] difference sometimes we open our mouth
[1:24:19] and remove all
[1:24:22] doubt and if you do good to them which
[1:24:25] do good to you what thank have ye for
[1:24:28] Sinners also do even the same and if you
[1:24:31] lend to them which you hope to receive
[1:24:33] here's Israel here what thank have you
[1:24:36] for Sinners also lend to Sinners and
[1:24:37] receive as much again but love ye your
[1:24:41] enemies do good and lend hoping for
[1:24:45] nothing again see that goes against all
[1:24:48] of our character but I'm telling you
[1:24:49] this is what Jesus said to be a
[1:24:50] Christian you got to do this right here
[1:24:52] I'm not preaching the seals today I am
[1:24:54] preaching the seals today I'm unsealing
[1:24:56] some things that we need we need to work
[1:24:59] on hoping for nothing again and your
[1:25:02] reward shall be great and you shall be
[1:25:05] the children of the highest for he is
[1:25:08] kind even unto the he who Jesus Christ
[1:25:13] amen is kind unto the unthankful yes and
[1:25:17] to the
[1:25:19] evil I think we need to walk different I
[1:25:22] think the problem we all have is is we
[1:25:23] hold
[1:25:25] grudges we know more than the next
[1:25:27] person does and if you treat me wrong
[1:25:29] bless God I'm telling everybody about it
[1:25:32] and God will give you some
[1:25:35] lightning no you might be the one that
[1:25:37] gets the
[1:25:38] lightning watch this we'll close
[1:25:40] musicians come on y'all stand people go
[1:25:42] to church they'll shake your hand in
[1:25:45] church and laugh call you
[1:25:48] brother outside the church they'll pull
[1:25:51] a little business deal that wouldn't be
[1:25:52] just exactly straight for personal game
[1:25:55] I wouldn't say them people are here in
[1:25:58] the Tabernacle but I say there
[1:26:01] is there's things that people would do
[1:26:03] and they get different a least little
[1:26:06] thing will bring that old temper back
[1:26:08] again that selfishness open up an ear to
[1:26:12] hear some
[1:26:14] gossip or do something of that type that
[1:26:17] person has never entered
[1:26:22] in that person has ever entered into
[1:26:25] this pot in here he's talking about
[1:26:28] going into
[1:26:30] sanctification they're outside they're
[1:26:32] truly eating the same kind of
[1:26:35] Mana they've been brought into the camp
[1:26:37] and that's where in the camp in the
[1:26:39] field it's where the people got the
[1:26:41] Mana and they're in there and that Mana
[1:26:44] that they eat is the same Mana this man
[1:26:47] eats
[1:26:48] here everybody believe brother Brown was
[1:26:50] a prophet all right okay they both both
[1:26:54] have the same
[1:26:56] Pastor they both read the same Bible but
[1:26:59] one constantly stays true and humble and
[1:27:03] the other ones got his ups and downs are
[1:27:06] going like this in and out both of them
[1:27:09] eating the same Mana but one of them has
[1:27:12] entered
[1:27:13] in and the other one is still
[1:27:17] out I'm just telling you what brother
[1:27:19] Brown said both of them are believers
[1:27:23] unto listen to me unto eternal life but
[1:27:27] one is baptized with the Holy Spirit in
[1:27:29] the kingdom of God and the other one is
[1:27:32] outside eating the same
[1:27:36] Mana wow I've seen people that shouted
[1:27:39] that lived any kind of life I've seen
[1:27:41] people dance in the spirit up and down
[1:27:43] the Halls come back out live horrible
[1:27:45] I've seen both men and women do that
[1:27:47] I've seen men and women dance in the
[1:27:49] spirit speak in tongu shout had a temper
[1:27:51] like I don't know what there's something
[1:27:54] wrong and yet they enjoy the blessings
[1:27:56] of God they believe in it they have
[1:27:58] faith in it but it's only in the outer
[1:28:02] Court it never has come to the inner
[1:28:05] Court there never got from here look he
[1:28:08] said from here down here all right this
[1:28:11] is the outer Court inner Court holy of
[1:28:13] holies you're getting close you love the
[1:28:16] Lord amen I just want to admonish you we
[1:28:18] got to start living and and and
[1:28:21] living not saying well they did

[1:28:30] a you know what gets me people people
[1:28:33] come in the post office and and and
[1:28:36] they'll do their job and we have a job
[1:28:37] to do because we get trained to do that
[1:28:39] certain job and somebody says you need
[1:28:41] to be retrained well if you work for the
[1:28:42] Post
[1:28:44] Office no so you don't know whether they
[1:28:46] need to be retrained or
[1:28:48] not hello that's the kind of attitude
[1:28:51] people have that's a bad attitude that's
[1:28:54] a horrible attitude and it needs to be
[1:28:57] dealt with and I'm dealing with it right
[1:28:58] now you need to be kind to your
[1:29:01] enemies people that hate you you don't
[1:29:05] speak evil against
[1:29:07] them what's our
[1:29:10] problem well sure we may have the Holy
[1:29:12] Ghost but brother brandom I believe he's
[1:29:14] talking about going into that Court
[1:29:16] remember you come back
[1:29:18] out and you start over again because
[1:29:21] right there's where you start over again

[1:29:24] holy ghost in a higher order we need to
[1:29:26] be in that higher
[1:29:28] order all of us needs to be yes now
[1:29:32] remember in sanctification the unclean
[1:29:33] Spirit goes out of your soul and God
[1:29:36] comes in he seals it up but remember
[1:29:38] there's still unclean spirit in your
[1:29:40] spirit
[1:29:41] realm hello there's unclean spirit in
[1:29:44] your spirit realm that's what makes us
[1:29:46] act
[1:29:47] up if your soul is what's making you act
[1:29:50] up you have no God in there that's right
[1:29:53] amen be kind to
[1:29:58] people that's true
[1:30:01] sanctification is to know that you can
[1:30:03] pray for somebody that hates your
[1:30:07] guts easy to love somebody that loves
[1:30:10] you but pray for somebody that hates
[1:30:12] your guts Lord have you ever prayed for
[1:30:14] somebody that cut you off on the side on
[1:30:17] the road no usually it's

[1:30:26] day Lord maybe they need salvation speak
[1:30:30] to those
