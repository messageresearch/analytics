========================================

their life abundantly [Applause] praise the Lord certainly thank God again for this privilege of being here in his house and you know today being Father's Day I mean back home it would be customary of me was expected that I speak concerning that end at this evening I would like to do just that you know I'd like to speak on the father's decision in the book of Genesis chapter first chapter 28 and then we'll read from Genesis chapter 34 then I'll use a few scriptures really I certainly believe the Church of God is a family of God and God will always instruct us you know as family or we ought to act and be and would guide us in our daily lives let us bow heads everywhere or Heavenly Father Lord want to thank you God for this privilege you have given to us to be in your house Lord as we come together Lord God we pray that oh god you'll speak to us to us Lord God and father Lord we pray that the instruction of the scriptures or God might be a benefit to the family of God as it is to the families individually Lord God we pray that Lord God we are not the author of all things but Lord God you are and father God we can pull back the pages but only you can break the bread of life to your children God and so we look to your God wait upon you and expect you God that you will speak to us as we have need pray O God that your word would be of benefit to your children just thank you for all things that we bless and praise your name in Jesus name we pray amen and amen in Genesis chapter 28 and verse 20 it's really in the life of Joe Jacob and Jacob vow a vow saying if God will be with me and will keep me in his way that I go and will give me bread to eat and remnant to put on so that I come again in my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my god and this stone which I have set for a pillow shall be God's house and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth on to the demon I really like that Amen it's not God axing it's actually Jacob you know by a pledge see he will do and in Genesis chapter 24 and the first verse and Dinah the daughter of Leah which she bare unto Jacob went out to see the daughters of the land where the Lord is blessing to the word you may be seated you know there's a there's a book that a brother gave me years ago I think it's written by a gentleman Jeanne Edwards and the the title of it is the tale of three kings many of you might have read it it's a story in humility and there's something very profound in in his thoughts there really is that God had a king all along but in that David that was God's choice to be the king of Israel there was a song that was buried in the soul he said in the morrow of David and so what God did yellow saw first to be on the Troon and then drive that Saul out of David it was a learning experience for for David so when David know take the truth he will said I will never be a solid because as far as David was concerned his King Saul was mad you know God has blessed us fathers and as the Bible declared the predestinated family you know is so set that by the Word of God that you know the father is a head of the house and you know I take an experience from the children I used to remember at all every time you know the children would have come together they would have play you know holes those of please cool and they would have done these things really and there's an experience I've always watched every time the children come to play school the person that takes the role of a teacher then they never take a chalk or something the first thing that they do they take a strap because in their mind the teacher width all right so that is their experience really and so we need to be careful what we pass on to our children now we as men as a father as the head of the house you know and the family is so set up that you know usually is the earner of finances it takes the resource to the family and you know we ought to realize that in the the unit of the family every person plays a role and a very important rule the family is a mechanism together that if one person don't play their role then the family unit is not together but I'd like to deal with these subjects really because one of the experience that I have and the things I'd like to say is that you know you're passing on the experience from one generation to another your children are your inheritance and one of the things that we must do as that predestined family is that especially when your children are coming into teenage years and all of that really the experience that they have is that the home is the greatest place of security no matter what their experience is in other words sometimes we can be too authoritative and so the children are look for a time when they can escape from this prison and that is a practical experience but the must be such a place that we create that kind of atmosphere that our children no matter what happened they want to be at home there's an experience of a human being wherever you call home if you go somewhere and something happen on the road you're you're an accident or something happen you know the person thought is that take me home I want to go home because there's something about whom that's where the love is that's where the care is that's where nurture is and I remember some years ago I was working at another place and I'm you know a friend of mine you know when it when it's time that it's time to clock out everybody's getting ready to go home really and so you know I saw him sitting out on the bench and you know everybody's Lima I said man what's happened and you know it might have lived in his family for a long time but it was a young married man Manny just you know the thing is that they would have lived together but one person get converted then they've got to get married and this is a new experience and you know I said what's happening you're not going home and he said man you wouldn't understand he said man ever since I get married the house become a war zone because she says I catch him no but you know I mean Jacob Jacob had an experience he was born for the birthright but he was born out of place in other words according to the law of the land Jacob was not qualified for the birthright but he was chosen for it and so with all the device that that went on God's not looking at that order that you came in he's looking at his grace and brother Branham said Jacob is Greece and here it was Jacob he actually stole the birthright from his brother and you know so he did his brother wrong so you think that God would have said no Jacob I'm gonna school you you took that birthright that did not belong to you you know by the order of your birth you're not qualified for the birthright but listen there was another thought in God's mind he was a chosen for that birthright amen and so no so he had to run from his brother and Jacob when he was leaving whom you know I like this really in Genesis 28 you know Jacob Evo Evo after you had that experience with God I said God will be with me and will keep me in his way that I go and will give me bread to eat and holily remnant to put on so that I might come again to my father's house in peace remember now when he was leaving if he went back to his father's house he would have died but if I would return to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my god he's setting a covenant between him and God and this stone which I have set for a pillow shall be God's house now he is putting it to God and of all that thou shalt give me will I surely give the ten unto thee when when I use the scripture back home I was preaching on the revelation of your tithing you see with Jacob it wasn't something that was acts of him it was something that he promised I'm going to give to you Lord as a covenant for what you're going to do for me hallelujah amen and so we find and I'd like to show you that because you know in Genesis 34 this note was after Jacob had met the angel and God would restore him and change his name and give to him this victory then in the next verse you know the Bible says that God that that Jacob meet his brother Esau and his brother attitude towards him was changed but after that victory no you said no so Jacob I'd met God you know the Bible says he met an angels Jacob said I met God face-to-face now after you'd met God God had changes meme and I want you to look at the time that this now happen you admit God God and change his name then Jacob now move the family to this place to steal and he build him a house there now Jacobs decision now it did not move the family within the wrens of the people of God but he move it close to this city of an unbelieving City and I tell you as the head of your house what you do with your family is determining what happens to that family we need to be careful of the decisions that we make now here is it he had no children and he was moving his family to a place and you're saying know where your children are going to fellowship what church will they go to who will be the pears you know where will they go to school am I taking my family among believers when you move the family when you make a decision what is the greatest thought what are the over writing or over arching situation that determine the decisions that you make because the decisions that you make can affect the family no here Jacob yet met God face to face but he was just a man and he was making a decision maybe Jacob wasn't considering everything to do with his family it's children who they will fellowship with so the Bible said no Dinah maybe a young girl coming to the time where she need other young girls to fellowship with but around her it's not what she wanted so she went to meet with the women of the city under a fellowship with the unbelievers no we know exactly what happened but what I want to focus on is what calls this really if Jacob the head of the house and move the family to this place then his daughter would not have been in the situation and so our decision as men as husbands as head of the else and notice there in Ephesians chapter 5 from verse 23 you know I've always and in in marriage counseling I've always said this to the couple I said I noticed that God did not says wives love your husband but God said Osmonds love your wives and how do I love my wife like Christ loved the church and be not bitter against her then in Ephesians 6 he talking about his children hallelujah he and provoke your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of God know your children are ready take your nature that's my dear Bert but what is more important is the nurturing of the family the extent to which you will go to ensure that the family is protected it's a man's position to ensure that his family is protected to ensure that his family is cared for to ensure that his family his children have the best to bring on the potential that they have battled up inside and so sacrifices has got to be made when you you know people have come to the stage and this time where they said well you know nobody made it a sacrifice for me so I'm not making any sacrifice for anybody when you come to the stage where you begin to start to be parents you're coming to that position in your life where you're no longer the greatest object of adoration but here you're bringing young ones into the world that if life progresa they're going to influence the world that they're going into and what they will take to influence that world is what they receive and the nucleus of their families really so we've got a greater sense of responsibility you know brother Branham led by a certain kind of example and you know brother Branham talks about him putting on an apron and in the kitchen and washing the dishes you know brother branham said a lot of things about the women of the world you know to his wife he talks about her as his sweetheart he said nice things about her he defended her really and brethren I tell you that's the example that we have in our time you know it should never be that way verbally because a man feel that you are the head how do you deal with that position do you speak down to them my word is law and if I say that's it you remember in the scripture it was Moses who did not circumcise his house and hallelujah and God was going to take action but his wife step into the picture you know when I came to the message years ago I had a problem where the brothers say where no woman can tell me anything well I'll tell you one thing I mean many brothers if they're wise were telling them what to do they're having better off today because I find many times that the women are more fervent dedicated to the Word of God hello that's just a truth amen and so it's not that oh well you know my wife has no saying this really it's my decision you see sometimes we become so authoritative that we cannot even reason properly within the framework of the family and as a man you've got to realize Jacob was a prophet of God that God just met him in the cave give him deliver answer but Jacob went out and make a decision that severely affect his family so does that mean that our words are law are we always right we're certainly not hello somebody we're not perfect and when you begin to look at yourself and they said self-evaluation is one of the greatest strengths of a human being these people who think that well you know I'm stronger than anybody and everybody else you know I'm better than everybody else you know they're always Friday if you're talking about hunting they're talking about that they made the best shot if you're talking about cars they drive the fastest and whatever subject you call they want to be the best it's kind of natural as human being but when the pre-designated family we realize that we're not perfect and our strength really begins when we realize as human beings that were not perfect or we relate to our family is important you know children are vulnerable and if the head of the osseous matter what kind of family we're going to have well when I say the head of the family's mad what I mean is that his father is a kind of person that assessing things whether it's rational or irrational when it's right or wrong whether it's reasonable or unreasonable is word carries a power and their authority than our even God can change in the house so I ask a question then what if your children make mistakes what you're going to do you know sometimes even the church become so legalistic in their approach that there is no grace but brother Branham said Jacob is Grace and if your brother has a fault how many times would you try to get him back in life if he make a mistake if he wronged you how many times would you forgive him and brethren then when we do that think now within the framework of our family you know I try to tell the children you know sometimes they get all shook up because in school they might do an exam or they do a test and you know they might think that they fail and you know that they're all shook up and I've always said this really I said hey look honey said you're young it is not the end of the world if you've tried and you're feel you've got time to try again hello sometimes we get to the stage where we said well listen if you're not the best in school then I'm wasting my time hey but you know something in life when you were that age you weren't perfect you made some stupid mistakes but then you want your offsprings to be perfect and to be honest with yourself if they're looking at you then they're totally mess hello so at appearance I said listen you know that you're there trying to tell your kids about the birds and the bee and you're going are over the moon and under the table and all and they're already know because what are the dumb things that we've got today this is information age there's nothing that is hidden you know then what your parents could have tell you and you thought that they well they call it a mystery what I call that bird that bring the babies with the stock but when you really thought that the stock being the babies and you're telling them that today they look at you and they're saying about you dumb because they already know that you get what I'm saying you see you're living in yesterday and your children are to deal amen and you've got no interest to intervene in what is happening today you don't know the music you don't understand the words you know one experience that I have you know the music that we had back in our day I could almost sing along because it was clean music the ones they have today you did not say that as a Christian because man you defile yourself but you know what your children know every word word for word of these things really me because they're living just like you know the words Batman when you were there they know the words right now where they are and so one of the things that we need to do we need to get to that level ello because you can either correct them or guide them if you don't know what they're going through one things that we used to do at home really and you know you send your kids to school back home here you can almost all back in Jamaica that's against the law and so they go to school and they mix with the Jones that worship dog and the dancers that worship cow and those that are Buddhist and and they go to school at everybody I'm just saying like that really you've got to when you find a time in the family when you know the name of your children's friend know where they live who their parents are and so you know you think that you live in a world up here and they're in a world down there so you never talk to them really hey listen if you're going to reach them you're going to have to know and build that kind of relationship that they can talk to you about everything because you'll find today the things that you couldn't talk to your parents about if you don't talk to your pet your children about that today you're in serious problem by the tempo of where the world is really going are you with me so you've got to be able to get down to the level of that family time where we talked about your debrief what happened today and so you know who John is and you know who Mary is and you know that they live over there and they live over there and listen get a part of their world bill relationship with your children there's so many times that husbands especially because you've got a work you've got to do these things your family is alien to you with what they're going through but you are the strong man in the house hello you know my girls they figure if a boy like them and you know what that whispering among each other they said daddy like him because if daddy don't like him then isn't no no but I say hey I'm going to live with infant I said one day you're going to find his hockey boy really and I'm going to laugh at him but I'm just joking he yeah but but listen you've got to build relationship be a part of their world everything they can come to you they can tell you you know why they can come to you they can tell you everything because you're a person of grace that if you make a mistake you have the characteristic that you are going to forgive sometimes things are going to urge you the direction that the family takes but listen look at your life to God you have made some serious mistakes in your life and what if God would have put you to the side and banish you forever and there was no way of getting back bredrin we ought to learn to forgive amen and though it hurt us really we still gotta forgive because the Bible says is that I'm going to save you with your offspring amen hallelujah and if God said that God means that hello somebody and so you've got an opportunity of Hope within the family amen so you believe in your children not only believe in your children but believing other people's children very important and when the framework of the church all the children are your children amen because they are a part of the family of God amen so here Jacob he made this mistake and Dino went out to be with the daughters of the city and so they was in the king's son that saw her and took her and defile her and so after all of that he wanted to marry to her but they were not a part of the Commonwealth of Israel and God forbid that really no sort of family now is in trouble now and the family find itself in this kind of trouble what are you going to do so you know that they come and they try to make a truce they said well you know we desire your daughter anything that you want and Jacob son they they came up with this device they said listen we can't have this with you because you're not circumcised but it said Abba if you become circumcised you become a part of us and we become part of you and those boys of Armagh they said are listen they tell everybody they say come on let us circumcised and be a part of them because all the cattles is going to be ours and all that is sheep and all that they have we're going to be one people you see but all of that is what comes after their work to be there in the first place but a father's decision know at the end of it do you take the blame for what happened do you say whatever happens to this family God I stand in that breach because I'm the decision maker of my house hey listen you know you said no it's not means my children is my wife is no no no no no you are the head of the house how you do will determine what comes of it really are you there with me and so here it is now what was happening to Jacob Souls Jacob had just meet God and for all of his years of wandering for all of his trouble God had set the peace with him and his brother but look what is going to happen to his house murder murder because of his decision and so he says well my sons did because my daughter did but what caused it because his decision had caused the family to be in a place that they were not supposed to be and so not because we are spiritual not because we've been blessed by God not because we think that we hear from God the family is important it's your inheritance the decisions that you make it will affect the family you know brethren it's a beautiful thing if your children after your example serve the Lord it's the most glorious thing in a family but you know if you if your children don't serve the Lord because of decisions that you've made then you've got to realize it's not just my children Lord I've made mistakes and how do I put that before God so that God can turn around and forgive my days that my children my inheritance would be the benefit of God's word amen hallelujah amen you know in Ezekiel 18 in verse 12 the Bible says the father has eaten the sower drip so Ezekiel was saying it is what the father did that is affecting the children and and you know brethren you're going to say well well you know brachear are you trying to say that all that happened to my children is my fault no I'm not saying that but I said we've got a responsibility as the head you know do we come down hard with the Amma do your children realize that in you there is grace that if I I go to the end of the road and and I've missed everything like the prodigal could your children come back to you like the prodigal son had gone back to his father and if your son had come back to you would you what the Sun had thought in his heart that I will go back and I'm some father of sin and because justice made me a servant would you say well yes boy be a servant or would you have that Father's heart a son cannot be a servant especially if he's coming to maturity before is mature the Bible says is no different from a servant but if he's mature in other words if he's repented if he come back he's no longer a servant but a son and you treat him that way brethren the family unit is important and father's need to realize that you've got a profound responsibility to your wife to your children to the entire family the things you do the things you say the decisions that you make is going to affect the family and so in your thoughts you're not perfect but God is perfect amen you know we don't think and especially around the message where they said women or women or women you know I tell you you know they said well Heath caused the fall but hey listen Satan was kicked out of heaven and come down into the Garden of Eden if he had not come in that garden there would be no fall amen so you've got to take it back to the beginning are you there with me you started this union and so you've got a profound responsibility you know we've got a thing as men that it is too hard for you to say I am sorry but you know fathers this morning this is Father's Day sometimes you have rung your children sometimes even within the families within the message you talk to children you talk to young people you talk to wives and there's this undercurrent of bitterness because of things that were said because of things that were done and sometimes you you want to move on as though it never happened brethren when there's a wrong it must be made right and you're never too big to say to your children a I've made mistakes in life might be what you are today I've made decisions that was not exactly what I should have made and I'm sorry but you know God together God can bring us back on track no matter how far that we think that we have gone [Applause] there's a lot of Tears that are not cried there's a lot of anger that is built up there's a lot of people with a lot of resentment because of decisions that we have made in our lives but brethren the family is important all the Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus and you and your whole soul shall be saved that's a covenant but you see for that covenant to be in effect you've got to go back and make things right according to st. mark 11 when you go to prayer forgive you've got to forgive your children of the things that you felt that they did against you hello amen and then they've got to seek forgiveness from you for the things that they've done but you know the stronger does it first well you know if they never say they're sorry I'm not sorry for what I did people say well they're hurt man and I'd say no sir as long as I live I'll never forget it and I'll never forgive them you'll never go to heaven [Music] that's really what you're saying I can't go to heaven because I'm saying I'm sorry brethren as believers we need to develop that attitude that if we feel like we've run somebody sometimes you know what you know you can the store to ten people people have never known the story to try to prove that you're not wrong but but what if I say I'm sorry and I wasn't wrong in first place hey you know my mother you said in a magnum Ashna coffee no - where you don't know what that means the cop didn't break so the coffee did spill hey men so what if I say I'm sorry and at the end of the day God say I wasn't wrong but at least I did what I thought that I could do because I first want to make the situation right and we're talking about the family how do you treat your wives the Bible says husband's love your wives you know so he said well well she's not submissive did you really love her the way you should in other words do you love her like you when you started when you would have walked across mountains and going to Valley at the dead of night hey you know marriage is like this really after the marriage get a few years down the road you know she said honey would you go in the room and get or you go get it yourself you you know when you started out really you to fix the split and make sure you like everything was in the right place by the color scheme and so and you and you gave it to him really because you want to make sure that your honor your sugar your third of and all of that nice things is all right after it goes down a few years down the road if you want to get it but the Bible command us really husbands love your wives with such a love that Christ loved the church and gave himself for it really you know when the great years begin to come when you can't walk as fast as you used to walk that's the time the love takes another turn it's not to mature Amen that's the time you really need one another that's when you need the companionship of each other and if you don't invest to be kind in the early years when you're older you won't get what you're expecting to get amen be kind to one another tender-hearted what Father's Day we've got a great opportunity as men of God as fathers as Christians as believers to lead our family the way God says I know the man Abraham that he will lead his children after him may God lead us may we be an example of the predestinated family may we be an example of people that know the utmost truth may we stand in faith and believe that no matter what happened to the family after years members of your family testify he was the best dad that I have and sometimes those children are not your biological children that's a great challenge that we have you know I've seen that the best of family you know mothers they are protected of their children and they come into a marriage after that they've got children and so they guard those children from that new husband because she figure is going to hurt our children you know really it's a nature that comes from the animal kingdom but if you love him enough to marry to him and you marry each other with children outside of that marriage you need to even go the extra mile to ensure that the offspring is taken care of you know Reverend chinku says that in the book fifty years in the Church of Rome when the priests came and take the one call that the family had you took the calf also in Jamaica and they said if you take the call the calf a feel in other words if you take her all our children are yours be a father to those children and you know if you have loved children all your life one of the problems that we have back home even know is that no to migrate a family migrating to the United States one time there was no DNA no they've got to do DNA and you know what they know doing the DNA for the family to remove the United States and they realize their children in the bunch that is not for the father I've seen young people that went off their mind because you know and a man if you have had this child all your life but your thought is over your child and then years after you're fine is not your child can you take that love we've got some things to deal with because of sin but brethren but we're the predestined of God and we ought to make a desire a difference so whatever position you find yourself in I wish at the end of the day I've heard minister's wife says I would never marry to another message preacher it's a disgrace it's not a shame it's a disgrace you should be the best man any man that stand behind this pulpit and his wife and his children can't said I'm proud of him as my husband I'm proud of him as my daddy you shouldn't be standing here I have one thing back home I said listen if a man bill abuse his wife he ain't preaching in other words if he is abuser in the past if the abuser if I know he ain't preaching for me that's period you know because listen your wife ought to be your greatest cheerleader if she don't see God in you you're just an appropriate behind the pulpit if your children don't see God in you I don't care what those children are there could be back saloon to the end of the earth but they know the way you treat them you are the best father that there is amen may God bless us this evening happy Father's Day to all the fathers and may you lead your children after you in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah praise God as we get together to pray let us pray you know in our lives we have made mistakes we've made decisions that know we can look back and we said you know if I was to do that all over again I wouldn't do it the way I've done it well you know the God who we serve as a God of mercy is a God who cares we can stand to the end we can says Lord forgive me because our of ignorance I've done things I shouldn't have done but lord I need my family to be an example of the Word of God as we pray together our Heavenly Father Lord we thank you God for the knowledge of your word we thank you Lord God for a man of God that lived a godly example for us to

Lord Jesus the Word of God be not blasphemed Lord we just believe that coming out of this bride out of this message this that we're living as we celebrate Father's Day we should have the greatest

Joseph one and a year he'd been hurt he'd be saying Papa Papa he's praying to him he he was talking to him like a real father he said Papa so that's why we need to talk amen make sure you tell our brother how much you appreciate him we appreciate them coming and being with us today and everything and we pray that the Lord would bless you and travel at home and and after we get through with the father's day little outing and and all and you just press the Lord would bless and God if you have anything you'd like to give him Church takes care of all the things but if you have anything you'd like to give him as a gift feel free to do so because I'd be fine with us all right I mean anything else before we go we're gonna be in cabinet 11 17 18 and 19
