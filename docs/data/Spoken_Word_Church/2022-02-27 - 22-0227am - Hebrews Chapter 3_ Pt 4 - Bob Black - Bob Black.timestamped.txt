[0:02] god bless you says
[0:10] all right praise the lord i i get to
[0:13] break it in
[0:16] we sure we sure appreciate all that all
[0:18] the work i i think brother joe called me
[0:20] last night to
[0:21] reformat my slides for this this new
[0:23] format
[0:24] they were still up here after after
[0:26] eight o'clock so
[0:28] they uh they they really put in a lot of
[0:31] work
[0:35] all right hebrews chapter 3
[0:37] verse 8 to 11 we made it up to where
[0:40] we're talking about
[0:42] in that timely that sermon that we were
[0:43] just listening to brother brown was
[0:44] talking about exactly what we've been
[0:46] talking about going to the promised land
[0:50] so everything just works in continuity i
[0:52] think that was um
[0:54] questions and answers from 1961 was that
[0:57] sermon that they were playing
[1:00] so it says in hebrews chapter 3 harden
[1:03] not your hearts is in the provocation
[1:04] and the day of temptation in the
[1:06] wilderness
[1:07] when your father's tempted me proved me
[1:09] and saw my works 40 years
[1:12] wherefore i was grieved with that
[1:14] generation and said they do always err
[1:16] in their heart and they have not known
[1:18] my ways so i swear in my wrath
[1:21] they shall not enter into my rest
[1:23] and we know like brother brown was just
[1:25] saying in that sermon that rest is
[1:27] is the
[1:28] uh
[1:29] is the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:32] everything that goes with it and when we
[1:34] get over it the closer we get to
[1:37] as you read through hebrews chapter
[1:38] three you can see that paul's leading up
[1:40] to what he's going to talk about in
[1:41] hebrews chapter 4 which starts off
[1:43] talking about rest and what that is and
[1:45] and so he's the further you go in this
[1:47] chapter he's kind of leading up more and
[1:49] more into talking about rest
[1:52] and and especially in hebrews chapter
[1:54] four you you begin to see that he says
[1:56] they could they didn't enter into the
[1:57] arrest because they didn't believe
[1:59] um and you know you think about as you
[2:01] go through all these these circumstances
[2:03] that they went through
[2:04] um
[2:06] it it it it's like little mile markers
[2:09] along the way where they they had a
[2:11] chance to make a decision
[2:13] and and we we've also got little mile
[2:15] markers along our way where you have a
[2:17] chance to see are you going to believe
[2:20] what the prophet said are you going to
[2:21] believe are you going to believe that
[2:23] there is a baptism in the holy ghost and
[2:24] you need it are you going to believe
[2:26] like the woman at the well and and uh
[2:28] are you going to do like nicodemus and
[2:30] just say well uh you know jesus told me
[2:32] that i need the baptism of the holy
[2:33] ghost but he wasn't found in the upper
[2:34] room so are you going to believe and and
[2:37] do like uh you know where brother said
[2:39] that enoch did everything that god
[2:40] required and so god gives us these
[2:42] requirements
[2:44] you you got to be baptized with the holy
[2:46] ghost you got to go down in the water
[2:48] and be baptized by water you've got to
[2:50] add to your faith virtue you got to do
[2:53] all these things and and of course it's
[2:55] not us doing it
[2:56] you just believe in and god will work it
[2:58] out in your life
[3:00] now so if you don't believe then it's
[3:03] it's like provoking god so if we go to
[3:05] the well down at the bottom sorry go
[3:07] back to that i didn't realize it was on
[3:09] the same slide
[3:11] provocation is action or speech that
[3:12] makes somebody annoyed or angry so of
[3:14] course you know anybody that if you if
[3:16] you say something if you tell somebody a
[3:18] promise or you say i'm going to be there
[3:20] at such a time or you're going to make a
[3:21] make a statement and if somebody doesn't
[3:23] agree with you or doesn't believe you
[3:25] then it's that can be a little bit
[3:26] aggravating so so the same thing with
[3:28] god if he makes a promise to us
[3:31] and we don't believe him
[3:33] like he promised the children of israel
[3:34] that if if they would just believe him
[3:36] the giants wouldn't matter they would be
[3:38] able to take the land it didn't matter
[3:40] uh how how rough the land looked when
[3:43] they got over to kedah kadesh barnett it
[3:45] looked like the land they said the land
[3:47] is just going to devour us
[3:49] that doesn't matter just believe god's
[3:51] word
[3:52] and you you keep moving on so on the
[3:54] next slide brother brown said they heard
[3:56] it but they didn't believe it god come
[3:58] down he showed them a pillar of fire
[4:00] showed by his prophets signs and wonders
[4:02] he was with him they didn't believe it
[4:04] they liked to see the miracles they
[4:06] liked to hear the prophet but as far as
[4:09] believing it they didn't their lives
[4:11] proved they didn't now he said don't you
[4:13] fall after that same example of unbelief
[4:16] let us not harden our hearts and fall in
[4:19] that temptation back yonder of unbelief
[4:22] for will rot on earth and that'll be all
[4:24] of it
[4:25] now now we'll we'll get into that a
[4:27] little bit further as it you know uh
[4:30] the warning here
[4:31] is that they all died in the wilderness
[4:33] and jesus said they're everyone dead
[4:35] right so we'll get it that's uh that's
[4:38] we'll get into that a little bit more as
[4:40] we go along
[4:41] try not to jump ahead
[4:43] um so the first we're going to just kind
[4:45] of background some of these provocations
[4:47] were where where they got to a place of
[4:48] decision
[4:50] and and they failed to go on with god's
[4:52] word so the first one we we looked at
[4:54] just briefly last time
[4:56] ready to turn back because of hardship
[4:58] they got to a place where the pharaoh
[5:00] began to keep on these extra
[5:01] requirements for them and they were
[5:03] ready to turn back
[5:04] and let's go to the next one they got to
[5:06] the red sea and you know and then
[5:08] brother ryan preached that message why
[5:10] christ speak and they got to the red sea
[5:12] and they failed they began to fail to to
[5:14] to see the promise that god had given
[5:16] them that he was he was able to make a
[5:17] way now
[5:19] keep in mind
[5:20] as we go through these stories there's
[5:21] really two stories that's unfolding one
[5:25] is the children of israel one is that
[5:27] like the people sitting in the pews and
[5:29] the other is moses now moses you know he
[5:32] he's got he got to a place where where
[5:34] god kind of got aggravated at him too
[5:37] why why are you crying to me you know
[5:39] what your purpose is
[5:40] now now watch as this story unfolds as
[5:43] they go through
[5:44] the the children of israel keep they
[5:46] they keep uh
[5:48] coming to a place where moses moses can
[5:50] recognize it they're not believing
[5:52] what's god what god's word and he wants
[5:54] he wants them to believe it's just like
[5:55] a parent watching your child you know
[5:57] they make bad decisions and you're like
[5:59] if they would just if they would just do
[6:02] different or whatever or or you think
[6:04] about
[6:05] think about now the example we're trying
[6:07] to show here is that ministers watching
[6:09] watching people in a church you know
[6:10] they disbelieve or whatever and and it
[6:12] that's the story that mo is unfolding
[6:14] with moses
[6:15] and now you watch what happens is moses
[6:19] has a little problem he's got a little
[6:21] temper
[6:22] and and the temper
[6:23] is so the temper is what what caused
[6:26] moses to not be able to go into the
[6:29] promised land
[6:30] so the children of israel the people in
[6:32] the pews can go into the promised land
[6:33] for their reason
[6:35] and the moses the minister couldn't go
[6:37] into the promised land for his reason
[6:40] so those are the two stories unfolding
[6:42] here
[6:44] now you think moses he's standing he's
[6:46] standing in the kind of standing in the
[6:48] breach standing that he keeps
[6:50] interceding jump when god wants to just
[6:52] destroy him and wipe things out he wants
[6:54] to he he he stands in the middle and
[6:56] says and plays the role of christ and
[6:58] says god don't don't destroy him
[7:01] remember your promises and things
[7:03] but then finally he gets so fed up with
[7:05] him
[7:06] that he smacks the rock
[7:09] so desire to turn back so that's number
[7:11] two
[7:12] out of 14. and then then the next one if
[7:14] we go to the next slide they began they
[7:16] got to bitter waters a rough spot and
[7:18] they started murmuring and saying i i
[7:20] wish i wish we'd have just stayed in
[7:21] egypt and and the bible says in verse 25
[7:24] and there he proved them prove them and
[7:26] said if thou wilt diligently hearken to
[7:28] the voice of the lord thy god and we'll
[7:29] do that which is right in his sight and
[7:31] we'll give ear to his commandments and
[7:32] keep all his statutes
[7:34] i won't put any of these diseases upon
[7:36] you
[7:37] my what a problem a promise of health
[7:38] the promise that god will take care of
[7:40] them and they continue to doubt god's
[7:42] word
[7:43] now on the next the next slide they got
[7:45] to a place where they they began to get
[7:47] hungry and they they started wondering
[7:49] where they were going to get food now
[7:50] now you think you think now let's let's
[7:53] look at the spiritual application over
[7:54] here they begin to doubt that god was
[7:56] going to be able to provide them food
[7:59] and and so
[8:00] that's where moses or god gave the
[8:03] promise to moses behold i will reign
[8:05] bread from heaven for you
[8:07] and and you know the next one right
[8:09] after this is is that they began to get
[8:11] thirsty now think about how those two
[8:13] things always go together in scripture
[8:15] hunger and thirst the bible says that if
[8:17] you hunger and thirst for righteousness
[8:19] you'll be is it your blessed just
[8:21] just to hunger and thirst for
[8:24] righteousness even if you're not filled
[8:26] yet if you just want it you're blessed
[8:29] just just to want it and and you think
[8:31] about the how those two things go to
[8:33] hunger for the word and to thirst for
[8:34] the word to be manifested for the spirit
[8:37] to come to quench the word or to not
[8:40] quench but to to make it manifest you
[8:43] think even when jesus was talking to the
[8:44] woman at the well he said the true
[8:46] worshiper is going to worship in spirit
[8:48] and in truth
[8:49] so you know you you could those two
[8:51] things go together you you're hungering
[8:54] for the word we want the word but then
[8:58] then when you've got the word
[9:00] you're hungering for the word to be made
[9:02] manifest
[9:03] because what what we'll say like what
[9:06] good does it do if you have all the
[9:07] charts and all the background if if you
[9:09] still got a temper and you're maybe
[9:11] dropping a little curse word every now
[9:12] and then
[9:13] and doing things that makes the makes
[9:15] your family and the church raise your
[9:17] eyebrows at you
[9:18] we want to we won't live a real
[9:21] christian life to have that life man
[9:22] manifest in our lives
[9:25] so so uh we're hungry we're hungry and
[9:28] thirsty we're hungry for the word
[9:30] we're uh
[9:31] and we'll we'll get to the
[9:34] there's more more to say about the word
[9:35] when they begin to complain about the
[9:37] manna but let's let's keep moving on so
[9:39] the next one they began to
[9:41] the to
[9:43] to gripe and complain about now having
[9:44] water and moses struck the rock and out
[9:46] of it came came water
[9:49] and then number six if we'll go on to
[9:51] that one
[9:52] y'all lagging a little bit
[9:55] i appreciate y'all
[9:58] number six i know i know i'm moving fast
[10:01] so the golden calf so moses went up to
[10:04] the mountain to get to to get the
[10:06] revelation that we'll say the revelation
[10:07] of jesus christ and bring it back down
[10:09] to the people actually written by the
[10:10] finger of god
[10:12] and instead of now brother brown would
[10:14] he would he would always use the
[10:15] illustration of a golden calf
[10:17] whatever you want to put in in front of
[10:18] god but
[10:19] a lot of times it would be money and and
[10:22] you know you've seen uh
[10:23] all the
[10:24] prosperity preachers and uh
[10:27] and uh
[10:28] people make the gospel something that
[10:30] it's not and hoard up a lot of money and
[10:32] start preaching different because they
[10:33] won't want money and they won't they
[10:35] won't preach the truth and you the
[10:37] golden
[10:38] when you start saying the golden calf is
[10:39] the thing that brought you out of egypt
[10:41] then you're you're ignoring the real the
[10:44] real main thing so the bible says in
[10:47] exodus 32 the lord said unto moses go
[10:49] get thee down for thy people which thou
[10:51] brawlest out of the land of egypt have
[10:52] corrupted themselves they have turned
[10:55] aside quickly out of the way which i
[10:56] commanded them they have made them a
[10:58] molten calf and have worshipped it and
[11:00] have sacrificed there unto you and said
[11:02] these be thy gods o israel
[11:04] which have brought me up out of the land
[11:06] of egypt
[11:08] and that's the first time that moses
[11:09] interceded for the people
[11:11] it jumped in the way of their
[11:12] destruction and pleaded with god
[11:16] now if we go to the next one
[11:19] number seven out of 14.
[11:22] so there's when the people began to
[11:24] complain about the manna
[11:26] they said there's nothing at all to eat
[11:27] beside this manna
[11:29] before our eyes
[11:31] they begin to get tired of the word
[11:33] now now you say well how can we apply
[11:35] that to today now you know
[11:38] um
[11:39] i think last time i mentioned that most
[11:41] of our most of our christian journey is
[11:44] moving up in a state of sanctification i
[11:47] i think hopefully we understand that now
[11:49] and i think brother hyde even mentioned
[11:52] most of your journey is under that ox
[11:54] anointing the ox laboring and pooling
[11:58] now now let's maybe let the holy spirit
[12:00] put the put these things together for us
[12:02] so so you know you you get in
[12:04] sanctification what are you doing you're
[12:06] you're packing that word in
[12:09] so now and you're trying you're trying
[12:11] to get somewhere where the spirit can
[12:12] quicken it and make it alive that's the
[12:14] baptism of the holy ghost
[12:16] even before you're born again when when
[12:18] you're in sanctification you're coming
[12:19] to church and you're trying to figure
[12:20] things out and you're trying to work out
[12:22] your salvation with fear and trembling
[12:23] and you're trying to trying to get all
[12:25] that word pic packed in and then then
[12:28] god
[12:29] fills you with the holy ghost and the
[12:30] new birth and things begin to come
[12:32] together
[12:34] the things these things start to come
[12:35] together so if you if you if you're
[12:37] complaining about the manna what does
[12:39] that look like
[12:41] it looks like somebody's saying well
[12:42] we've already got it all
[12:44] we don't need teaching
[12:45] we don't need teaching the word because
[12:48] then you what are you doing you're
[12:49] complaining about the word you're saying
[12:51] well we've already got we've already got
[12:53] what we need is the baptism holy ghost
[12:54] yeah yeah you need the baptism the holy
[12:56] ghost but first you need the teaching
[12:58] you need the manna so when you we've got
[13:01] all these uh
[13:02] this great rich the great riches of
[13:04] wealth that of the message we've got uh
[13:07] daniel 70 weeks which is a revelation
[13:09] you've got to see that before you can
[13:11] really see the seventh seal you've got
[13:13] to see that
[13:14] and and and who was this melchizedek and
[13:17] christ the mystery of god revealed and
[13:19] and all these great reaches and if you
[13:21] don't pack that in then what can the
[13:23] holy holy ghost quicken
[13:25] you so would you say you you say well we
[13:27] don't need the word
[13:29] or we don't need teaching you're doing
[13:32] exactly the same thing that they did
[13:33] back then you're complaining about the
[13:35] man are complaining about the word
[13:39] and brother and and moses i was going to
[13:41] say brother moses brother moses said
[13:45] you you look look at moses maybe just
[13:48] kind of get i'll take a quick detour
[13:50] real quick
[13:51] moses was discerning
[13:53] what was in those people's heart right
[13:56] you know sometimes we major on
[13:57] discernment and we want to we we want to
[13:59] say
[14:00] so and so has discernment or whatever
[14:02] thing but
[14:04] i believe that every born again believer
[14:06] can discern by your revelation whether
[14:08] something is true or not you're actually
[14:10] sitting here right now discerning
[14:12] whether these things that i'm saying are
[14:13] correct or not now now moses because
[14:16] discern means to tell whether it's true
[14:18] or not
[14:19] so moses was looking at the reaction
[14:21] that the people had and he was able to
[14:22] tell whether it was correct or not like
[14:25] like for example that somebody the other
[14:26] day somebody called me on the phone and
[14:28] they said bob you and brother wade and
[14:30] brother hayek brother haye was saying
[14:32] the same thing that you and brother
[14:33] and brother bob you and brother wade
[14:35] never have been preaching about so now
[14:37] now now i was able to discern
[14:40] that's a good thing
[14:42] that's you you're you're being able to
[14:44] you're you're putting the dots together
[14:46] you're you're connect something
[14:48] something
[14:49] something beyond a chart or just
[14:51] something the minister's saying is
[14:53] putting the dots together for you when
[14:55] when you begin to see how the picture
[14:57] fits together
[14:58] so now moses is looking at the um
[15:01] at the reaction of these people there's
[15:03] nothing at all beside this manner and he
[15:06] was able to tell or discern
[15:09] that their heart was not in the right
[15:11] place that they were not seeing
[15:12] correctly what god wanted them to see
[15:15] he was able to discern
[15:17] something was wrong
[15:20] i think i mentioned earlier you know you
[15:22] you hear some when some when people echo
[15:24] back what's being preached you can tell
[15:27] what's whether whether
[15:30] you can tell what
[15:32] whether something's wrong or not how can
[15:34] how can you tell how can you tell
[15:36] because what is it of faith or not
[15:38] if you're preaching something then
[15:40] somebody echoes back well i i i don't
[15:42] know if that's right
[15:44] or or they they're echoing back
[15:45] confusion
[15:47] or they're echoing back doubt like these
[15:49] hurt were here then then it just shows
[15:52] that
[15:53] you're not quite at the right place yet
[15:55] and so moses
[15:56] again we're telling these two stories
[15:59] moses looking at their doubt
[16:01] he's starting to get frustrated and he's
[16:03] starting to get down
[16:05] and he said i'm not able to bear all
[16:06] these people alone because it is too
[16:08] heavy for me and if thou deal thus with
[16:10] me
[16:11] kill me he started having suicidal
[16:13] thoughts just kill me i pray thee out of
[16:15] hand if i have found favor in thy sight
[16:17] and let me not see
[16:19] my righteousness
[16:21] i'm i'm getting to something here
[16:23] so let's go to
[16:25] number eight
[16:27] then they started complaining about
[16:28] moses leadership
[16:30] and myriad that's where miriam was
[16:32] cursed with leprosy you you ever think
[16:34] about all these things that that we're
[16:36] looking at here
[16:37] a lot they almost paralleled things that
[16:39] actually happened in brother brown's
[16:41] life
[16:42] there's a parallel for just about every
[16:44] one of these things in brother ramsey's
[16:45] life where men's pentecostal ministers
[16:47] would reject his teaching and just like
[16:49] they rejected moses and and and this in
[16:51] this case brother ram used the example
[16:53] of his wife how one day uh you know
[16:56] he came in the house and and she was
[16:58] dealing with some teenage problems with
[16:59] rebecca and she said she started telling
[17:02] them you're never here and you're never
[17:04] uh
[17:05] you know you you um i think now
[17:08] she didn't really say she didn't say
[17:10] something that you would think as being
[17:12] particularly harsh she just said you're
[17:14] never here to make decisions with me
[17:16] and brother brown said you're going to
[17:17] have to answer for that
[17:19] she said and you think about this from a
[17:22] spiritual perspective that god had a
[17:24] mandate just like or brother i'm at a
[17:26] mandate from god just like moses did to
[17:28] lead the people so he wasn't home a lot
[17:30] and he wasn't doing what a normal father
[17:32] would do because he was he was
[17:34] responsible for
[17:36] everything we're preaching
[17:38] everything we believe in this age and so
[17:41] she got a little bit frustrated with him
[17:42] just like just like and he compared it
[17:45] with with um miriam miriam thinking well
[17:47] you're you're not doing what i think you
[17:49] ought to do and she was what did it do
[17:52] it slowed the whole children of israel's
[17:54] walk for seven days
[17:56] so because she got leprosy and so it
[17:59] shut down everything
[18:00] it shut down their walk they couldn't go
[18:02] anywhere all of the children of israel
[18:04] got they they got stopped in their
[18:06] tracks because they had to wait for for
[18:08] seven days for miriam's leprosy to be
[18:10] cleansed this was the second time moses
[18:13] interceded for the people
[18:15] because he interceded he cried he began
[18:16] to cry out for miriam he said and it
[18:18] says healer now oh god i beseech thee
[18:20] and the lord said unto moses if her
[18:22] father had but spit in her face
[18:24] shall she not be ashamed seven days
[18:27] later be shut out from the from the camp
[18:29] seven days and after that let her be
[18:30] received in again
[18:32] and then they finally get to
[18:34] kadesh barnea where god had given them a
[18:37] promise that that uh they would be able
[18:39] to take the land what's the land the
[18:41] promise of the holy ghost the promise
[18:43] promise of the seven seals the promise
[18:45] of everything that the the promise of
[18:47] understanding the bible and the promise
[18:50] of overcoming your enemy promise of
[18:52] overcoming death
[18:54] all of those things are typed in this
[18:55] story here
[18:57] and all the congregation lifted their
[18:59] voice and cried and the people wept that
[19:00] night why because they they came back
[19:02] and said they're giants
[19:04] and and
[19:05] and and and the land eateth up the
[19:08] inhabitants thereof
[19:09] and everybody's big there's a lot of
[19:11] problems and all the children of israel
[19:14] murmured against moses and against aaron
[19:15] and the whole congregation said unto
[19:17] them
[19:18] what would god that we had died in the
[19:20] land of egypt now now what what what are
[19:22] the giants there's a lot of giants
[19:23] giants
[19:24] bullies in the message
[19:25] giants are problems in your life
[19:28] giants what whatever the devil throws at
[19:30] you but god is more than able to deliver
[19:33] us out of every every giant that stands
[19:35] up in front of you it doesn't matter if
[19:37] you believe god's word
[19:41] and he and they said wherefore hath the
[19:43] lord brought us into this land to fall
[19:44] by the sword that our wives and our
[19:47] children should be a prey
[19:48] were it not better for us
[19:50] to return into egypt and they started
[19:53] looking back that a christian a real
[19:55] christian always looks forward like like
[19:57] those four uh beasts that the four
[20:00] messengers that brother hyatt was
[20:02] preaching about they always going
[20:04] forward
[20:04] never back that's what the holy ghost
[20:07] does in your life and you're always
[20:08] going forward and then if we go to the
[20:11] the tenth slide or the next slide number
[20:13] 10 they begin to say let's just vote out
[20:16] moses and we'll just get somebody else
[20:18] and they said to one another let us make
[20:20] a captain let us return into egypt
[20:22] and joshua the son of nun and caleb the
[20:24] son of jefonna which were of them that
[20:26] searched the land
[20:27] rent their clothes
[20:29] but all the congregation made stone them
[20:31] with stones
[20:32] i think this is the strangest story that
[20:34] they were right there
[20:36] at
[20:36] at the crossing over and they got so
[20:39] upset with
[20:40] the men that were trying to say that we
[20:42] believed god's word that they were ready
[20:44] to kill them
[20:46] and this is the third time moses
[20:48] intercedes for the people
[20:49] now
[20:50] now you think i'm leading up to all
[20:52] these things
[20:53] joshua topping ministers no
[20:56] caleb type of believers moses typing
[20:58] ministers and and looking out on the
[21:00] people the children of israel and seeing
[21:02] people uh not believe and expecting a
[21:05] different reaction and getting getting
[21:07] frustrated and and moses having this
[21:09] problem with tempers and things and
[21:11] this whole story the whole story
[21:13] unfolding it paints a picture of a lot
[21:15] of frustrations and a lot of problems
[21:17] and so when you get problems and
[21:19] frustrations in your life you don't turn
[21:20] back like now like ministers now let's
[21:23] talk about ministers we don't we don't
[21:24] turn back if our if our message is not
[21:26] received in the way that we think it
[21:28] should be
[21:29] and i was telling brother luis a few a
[21:32] few weeks ago i said i'm going to put
[21:34] this slide in here so if we go to the
[21:36] next one
[21:37] just something to think about now
[21:39] i i found i was looking up all these
[21:40] stats and this is a stats about pastors
[21:43] but this let's just expand it on out to
[21:45] ministers that 75 percent of pastors
[21:47] report being extremely stressed or
[21:50] highly stressed and 90 work between 55
[21:53] to 75 hours a week and 90 percent feel
[21:56] fatigued and worn out every what are you
[21:58] talking about brother i'm talking about
[21:59] brother moses
[22:00] at 40 percent report a serious conflict
[22:03] with a parishioner at least once a month
[22:06] 91 percent have experienced some for a
[22:08] form of burnout and ministry and 18 say
[22:11] they are fried to a crisp right now now
[22:13] now the reason i'm putting this in
[22:15] because because when you when you get in
[22:17] in trouble when you get to a troublesome
[22:19] spot and you get laid way down in the
[22:21] valley it's it's not time to turn back
[22:24] but it's time to buckle down i i
[22:25] reminded a lot of that story that in the
[22:27] bible where david
[22:29] he came to the camp and the philistines
[22:30] had taken all of his family and
[22:32] everything that he had taken all their
[22:33] wives and ran off with them and
[22:35] kidnapped everything and he said bring
[22:37] me the ephod because he knew in that
[22:39] moment of despair he was turning to the
[22:41] word of god so in the moment of your
[22:43] despair when it looks like things are
[22:45] going wrong and a lot of times it does
[22:47] it it's not time to do like moses and
[22:50] just throw down the tablets of stone
[22:51] after you come down and and got them
[22:53] from the it's not time to do like moses
[22:55] and just have a little temper tantrum
[22:57] but just rest rest upon god's word now
[23:00] the next slide
[23:01] 70 of pastors say they have a lower
[23:04] self-esteem now than when they enter
[23:06] ministry 70
[23:09] constantly fight depression
[23:11] now see a lot of times you know we'll
[23:12] preach about the young people having
[23:14] depression but depression ain't just
[23:15] something for young people
[23:17] it's it's something when you you know
[23:19] you you feel like things aren't going
[23:21] the way that you expect like you think
[23:23] about all the effort that moses put into
[23:25] that all the effort and going down into
[23:27] egypt and and preaching his heart out
[23:30] for two people out of the original bunch
[23:32] for two people
[23:35] that's why he was he had some rough
[23:37] spots fifty percent feel so discouraged
[23:39] that they would leave their ministry if
[23:41] they could but can't find another job
[23:42] and listen i know from personal from
[23:45] from experience talking to pastors in in
[23:47] my past there's a lot that have had
[23:49] mental breakdowns and depression and
[23:52] things and people because i i talked to
[23:54] one
[23:55] that uh he said people call me in the
[23:57] middle of the night
[23:58] to pray for the fleas that their dog has
[24:00] and and i just want people to be able to
[24:02] to come to a place where they they know
[24:04] that they can lay their hands on their
[24:06] own dog and they just get to a place
[24:08] where you know they're constantly they
[24:10] get so discouraged and and uh
[24:13] 80 believe their pastoral ministry has
[24:16] negatively affected their families and
[24:17] 33 percent it was an outright hazard
[24:20] 80 percent of ministry spouses feel left
[24:22] out and unappreciated in their church
[24:24] and 77 percent
[24:27] feel they did not have a good marriage
[24:29] because because they go through things
[24:31] like brother branham when he got home
[24:32] and his his wife in that moment did not
[24:34] understand the calling that she was
[24:36] supposed to have in her life because
[24:38] when a man is called to serve the gospel
[24:40] so is his wife
[24:42] a man that's called to the priest the
[24:43] gospel
[24:44] his wife has to understand that when
[24:46] he's off studying a little bit
[24:48] then then he in that moment when he's
[24:50] got to preach a sermon he can't be
[24:52] mowing alone
[24:53] it's got you just you're called together
[24:55] to understand
[24:57] 80 of ministry spouses feel left out 77
[25:00] feel they do not have a good marriage
[25:01] and 65 feel their family is in the glass
[25:04] house
[25:05] now let's go to the next slide what did
[25:07] brother brown say about this he said
[25:08] they got weary
[25:10] and the musicians should go ahead and
[25:11] come forward every time they get to a
[25:13] place where a showdown come and i see
[25:15] that goes for ministers and for the
[25:18] laity when you get to a place where
[25:20] there's a showdown
[25:21] don't get weary keep pressing on
[25:24] because we've got an anchor
[25:26] and i'll stop right there
[25:29] [Applause]
[25:55] you
