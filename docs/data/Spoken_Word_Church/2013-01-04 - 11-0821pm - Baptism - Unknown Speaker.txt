========================================

that's right I know we all know why we're here and this is special time for me and this should be my first one so that's this stuff it's just the right time right play that's it right time roughly if you wanna y'all know you don't have your Bible because you turn chapter six of six of Romans Paul is explaining what Jesus was telling the people when he said be baptized this is what I believe because what he says here watch this he says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound in other words why are we continuing on in this saying that we're that we're doing he said God forbid in other words let's do something about it and that's what we're doing brother Chris is finally he's doing something about it amen we all come to a point like I said today we come to a point to where the word was lit in her heart and we started enjoying the things of God instead of the things of the world God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein in other words how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein first thing I want to do get in the water get baptized I wanted a new name they'll talk about a new name we're fixing to give brother Chris a new name right he's going to be the Lord Jesus Christ that's right can we believe that right that's what he's going to be we baptized our brother Chris in the name keep taking on your name right we're gonna have a burial here today we're gonna put somebody to death know you not that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death he's still asking the question therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like his Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life or if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death go down planted we're going to plant him all right and once you're going to come back up as not the same dead person right but what but we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin if your old husband's dead you marry again but your husband's got to be dead you can't just divorce him you put a lot of we put like we said we put a lot of like take a lot of dry centers and just make them wet Center what'd they do they just hung they just hung their ideas up in a closet somewhere but if there's a real killing if there's a real death then we marry again that's who we're married we're married to Christ is that correct now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ's being raised from the dead dies no more death has no more dominion over him what was I saying today she is him so we need to read the scripture for us all right death had no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once we don't have to every time we stand we don't have to go be baptized we're not Roman Catholics we don't have to pay tenants if there's a real death today we won't have to bury brother Chris again right right he buried once Jesus Christ died once wrong all right so now likewise reckon we also we also that we also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord amen that's the scripture death burial Resurrection the newness of life not be dead again we didn't come back we're not we're not going this far to die again you die one time you're dead let's don't resurrect the old people again the old you the one we're talking about today let's let's when we put when we put him in the ground he's not going to die physically but you know what it's better to die spiritually and come up in the newness of life right than to really be dead naturally because if you're dead spiritual you'd be walking around alive remember the Bible says why is a woman dead while she living she's had other husbands she's done things wrong she's she's well she's alive she's dead so let's don't be that way and a woman's a time for giving out of the church right but if she's divorced she can't married but now she's if her husband's dead she can marry again and we're him and guess what we're going to take our brother we're going to baptize him in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and we're going to bring him up a new man man you may not see it right off when he comes up he's just gonna look a little wet but Betty when I come up out of that water it was like I had everything when I come up it just emptied all out and I became a new creature a new creation God's gonna do a creation here that's why I said if you're baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost right let's don't just take that script and say well now we went to board of baptism now let's go now they're combined they're together I think they're together right that's scriptures together right you get a promise that if you'll do this this is available for you for both Chris little dick leaves himself oh who will come and go with me I am Bound for the promise this is going to start the journey right here so this is where the Journey's moving in really to fulfill the commission told him to go into all the world preach the gospel and baptize in the name of the father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost to fulfill that Great Commission we baptize our brother Chris and In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Hallelujah we're here to help anybody else foreign Lift us up Lord Jesus for your word is we've come today to bigger fitting with your words and baptize our brother in your name yes walk with him Lord as your word said that I love that National fatherhood that you wrote there in Acts it was just for me because that's the only light I had to hold on that's right bro amen father God it was enough and then patient was sending it to me and bringing me to this place and today bringing brother Chris yeah scored it now that he can walk into this alive she almost received a gift just continue walking brother Chris and and receive that gift because the gift is yours that's right amen eternal life walk on into it I asked you Lord let's continue sending your word to us and most of all father send your understanding yes give us your faith give us your mind Lord that we know these things because we can't do this without you do it for us brother and we just present ourselves before you father and ask you just to have your way with us we ask these things in your precious name and bless the bride around the world right here at home real partial too thank you Father God it seem to ask your name Lord Jesus Christ amen
