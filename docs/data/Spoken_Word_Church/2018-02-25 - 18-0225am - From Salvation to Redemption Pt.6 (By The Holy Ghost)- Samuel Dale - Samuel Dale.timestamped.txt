[7:50] each one got us now in Jesus name we may
[7:59] move up a notch or two in another
[8:00] message not be reading from this but
[8:03] it's fine to me I like to read what it
[8:05] says you only had a good thought about
[8:07] it verse 9 but I will sacrifice unto
[8:10] thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I
[8:13] will pay that that I have vowed
[8:17] salvation is of the Lord I love that
[8:21] Porter saying it don't you let's go to
[8:25] first Corinthians toyo to kind of pick
[8:27] up our thought for today brother Joe and
[8:32] him I gave him 30-something quotes and
[8:34] he said we're gonna try to get through
[8:36] that this morning I said I doubt that I
[8:38] don't know probably won't but we'll
[8:41] we'll see all right now let's read their
[8:44] Scripture and then think about what it's
[8:45] saying now concerning spiritual gifts
[8:48] this is Paul in the Corinthians talking
[8:54] to the Gentiles and talking about you
[8:57] know and they got these just going they
[8:58] got this going and that going and
[9:00] everybody had to have a sign and us song
[9:02] anything and he says now concerning
[9:04] spiritual gifts brethren I would not
[9:06] have you ignorant you know that you were
[9:09] Gentiles cleared away with these dumb
[9:11] idols even as you are lay it were led
[9:15] her for I give you to understand and see
[9:19] he's laid down he's talking about the
[9:21] gifts he's talking about the spiritual
[9:23] gifts and the things in other word don't
[9:25] get all build up in it and don't be
[9:28] carried away by dumb idols and think oh
[9:30] that could lead from this type of gifts
[9:32] into that type of gifts to take you into
[9:34] the to the wrong thing and he says now
[9:37] I'll give you to understand that no man
[9:40] speaking by the Spirit of God
[9:43] Jesus accursed and that no man can say
[9:47] that jesus is the lord but by the holy
[9:52] ghost you may be seated
[9:54] Lord that is blessing to the reading of
[9:57] the word now Paul is emphatically
[10:00] stating did you know no man in other
[10:07] words you you can't say this about him
[10:09] you can't say that about him and then
[10:11] you you can in no way say that Jesus is
[10:14] the Lord except it be by the Holy Ghost
[10:20] okay now to try to back up a little bit
[10:23] to where we were
[10:25] Wednesday and I pray that you would
[10:29] listen to that message I've listened to
[10:31] it twice already and I wish you would I
[10:35] got kind of tickle some of you better be
[10:38] careful about you're shaking your head
[10:40] no because a lot of us on the internet
[10:45] you know you know go when we walk down
[10:48] the aisles it picks up them yes isn't em
[10:51] noses in there okay not kind of that's
[10:54] alright but now what were we talking
[10:57] about Wednesday trying to get settled
[11:01] into something and what we're doing is
[11:05] trying to comprehend why brother Branham
[11:09] would say certain things in a certain
[11:13] way you say well that's you trying to
[11:16] figure it out now if we say what he says
[11:18] and we let it be the point that he says
[11:20] it then you're going to have to argue
[11:23] with him about what it is all right
[11:25] because I'm just trying to to get it to
[11:30] a point that we won't read and say well
[11:32] he said this and he said this and he
[11:34] said this and we just don't know what
[11:36] he's saying because that's that's what
[11:40] I've told you you don't have to worry
[11:42] about preaching the seals and in Daniels
[11:44] 70 weeks and things like that to people
[11:46] that they're already confused anyway but
[11:49] the new birth is the most misunderstood
[11:53] doctrine that there is and that was
[11:55] Jesus's first doctrine
[11:57] which he must be born again all right
[12:00] it's the most misunderstood why because
[12:02] you know he said it I didn't he said
[12:04] it's over 900 different ways of people
[12:07] seeing it out Dyer within how many you
[12:10] got in the message you know that would
[12:12] go along with that of being confused
[12:14] about one little doctrine of you must be
[12:18] born again
[12:19] one little called me I said something
[12:23] one time to a person you know they said
[12:25] well oh I know they're suing so say
[12:28] because they don't cut the higher they
[12:30] don't want they don't wear pants they
[12:31] don't know that has nothing to do with
[12:34] the new birth that is after effects
[12:37] that's after thoughts that's things you
[12:39] should do without the new birth right
[12:44] without even the new birth women or look
[12:47] like women and men or to look like men
[12:49] without the new birth considering
[12:52] nothing about the new birth
[12:54] alright see but we put those things of
[12:57] the attributes instead of talking about
[13:00] the birth not concerning what is the new
[13:02] birth what is the new birth
[13:06] alright see did you say I cry don't know
[13:10] that's that's what happens after the
[13:13] baby gets here that has nothing to do
[13:16] with the birth itself except that it is
[13:19] an outward manifestation and now listen
[13:23] a dead baby is a dead baby and has no
[13:26] manifestation so then the Prophet said
[13:29] it it ain't got no life to it and ain't
[13:31] alive now I believe in manifestation I
[13:35] believe in all kind of signs and wonder
[13:37] that I do I believe in shouting and
[13:39] crying and speaking in tongues and all
[13:41] of the I don't believe that was was took
[13:44] away by anything the Prophet said I
[13:47] think he was a very emotional person at
[13:50] times but then there was times he was
[13:52] very settled and seemingly more into the
[13:55] later part of his ministry he was more
[13:57] settled why because he was so burdened
[14:01] of trying to get across to the people a
[14:05] simple little message of what is the new
[14:07] earth and
[14:10] than that away that's why I believe it
[14:13] and I hold to it that that none of us
[14:18] knew what the new birth was until this
[14:19] prophet comes all right we had this idea
[14:24] right we had that idea like I said
[14:26] brother Branham wasn't against
[14:28] emotionalism he was a very emotional
[14:30] person in that respect honor but he knew
[14:34] how to place it correctly get it correct
[14:38] and shout all you want to Boyd they say
[14:40] he said be careful how high you jump up
[14:42] he said word that you can walk straight
[14:44] when you come down right see in other
[14:49] words the life you live is going to
[14:50] prove what you are all right and see
[14:54] then that would would would put the
[14:55] things into order and don't ever get to
[14:58] point earth out on my brother Dale he
[15:00] was just a good ol here's an old Baptist
[15:01] and he don't believe in signs and
[15:03] wonders i I've told you my life story
[15:06] some of you even told yours and you know
[15:08] compares pretty good I've seen a lot of
[15:12] things in my life and I'm really a very
[15:14] emotional person but I don't let other
[15:16] people I don't use that to try to make
[15:19] you emotional I want you to be what you
[15:22] want to be and that's that's just the
[15:24] point
[15:25] all right now but what was we talking
[15:27] about brother Branham said he says your
[15:32] new birth begins when you believe now
[15:43] see we then we say well we're believing
[15:44] this now he didn't say believing was the
[15:47] new birth he said your new birth begins
[15:55] now what is the new birth
[15:57] we've already or should have established
[16:00] it enough into our hearts and minds to
[16:01] know that the new birth the Prophet will
[16:07] read it worse the revelations Jesus
[16:08] Christ personally use what is it born to
[16:11] gain experience what is the baptism of
[16:14] the Holy Ghost
[16:15] it's all one in the same that we're
[16:16] reading them in it but now you can start
[16:21] something here now when you start your
[16:23] new birth by
[16:24] believing that don't give you the
[16:25] baptism of the holy God so you can start
[16:31] see than you can say the born-again
[16:34] experience can start the day you believe
[16:39] but now remember what we brought out
[16:43] that you could also if you didn't go on
[16:46] and get sealed into the body of Christ
[16:49] that you could lose your confession lose
[16:53] your faith and wind up the Prophet I
[16:56] gave you one there Wednesday where he
[16:58] said that's the question they did about
[17:00] could it be this you know be the one he
[17:02] said yes said you can be a child of God
[17:04] one day and said be a child of the devil
[17:06] the next day now he's the one who said
[17:12] it see them because you could be a
[17:17] confessor today and walking in
[17:19] Christianity and the Thames and tomorrow
[17:23] out in the world drunk em everything in
[17:26] the book you know and see then you lose
[17:30] your confession and remember a point if
[17:32] your confession is right then your
[17:35] salvation is right see now and we should
[17:39] go back and listen Co in no way did I
[17:42] try to explain eternal life I gave some
[17:45] quotes brother Branham said on it and
[17:47] told you in there that I didn't
[17:49] understand why he used that statement
[17:51] like that other than the fact of knowing
[17:54] that most people talk about eternal life
[17:57] they talk about the new birth they Toma
[17:59] and he said you know he said you believe
[18:03] in to eternal life well I believe that I
[18:07] believe the day you repented of your
[18:10] sins because what is the new birth now
[18:14] justification sanctification and the
[18:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new
[18:20] birth all right so a justification
[18:24] you're believing unto but that doesn't
[18:27] complete the birth see then you could
[18:32] use the born-again experience that
[18:34] justification sanctification
[18:37] but remember now the baptism don't come
[18:40] until you're justified and sanctified if
[18:43] it does it could be a just an anointed
[18:46] one we certainly don't want that part
[18:50] see if you stopped short of the correct
[18:53] channel was what I'm trying to bring
[18:55] Wednesday if you stopped short of that
[18:57] channel then your unbelieving I mean
[19:00] you're believing becomes unbelief and
[19:04] you you go right back to where dear
[19:06] really
[19:07] the Bible says that the unclean spirit
[19:10] goes out of a man it goes out of
[19:11] sanctification walketh in dry places all
[19:14] right said it comes back and find it
[19:15] swept and garnished it entered in and
[19:18] the person is worse then there was to
[19:21] start with because why because what is
[19:23] the profit they become religious right
[19:29] that's where you anointed ones falling
[19:31] that they become religious and he said
[19:36] that's was listen another night work on
[19:38] what is it and with it not I believe it
[19:41] we're brought around was describing how
[19:43] this lady was so horrible and think and
[19:45] do it but said this other lady was a
[19:47] Methodist or something and said she was
[19:49] telling her husband to look at her what
[19:50] she's doing over there he said but then
[19:52] she goes out every day puts on her short
[19:55] sometime gets out and cuts the grass he
[19:57] said as far as God is concerned both of
[20:00] the women looked the same but now he
[20:03] said that's why you can't tell her
[20:04] though and sold over in that message
[20:06] because she's anointed with the Holy
[20:09] Spirit and you can't tell her that
[20:12] church is one thing that I've prayed and
[20:15] prayed and I'm pray every day and cry
[20:18] out to God for some way for us to find
[20:22] the truth of what we are and where we
[20:25] are well brother Dale I've shouted I
[20:27] spoke in tongues out crowd I believe the
[20:29] mess hall all that's well and good but
[20:35] if the new birth is not there then what
[20:38] is it anointed ones see we're in the day
[20:42] where it's dangerous right well I know
[20:44] when I was there I know when the Spirit
[20:46] came on me well Elizabeth could say that
[20:51] when Mary said that she was pregnant and
[20:55] going to have a baby in his name with
[20:56] Jesus not just John receiving the holy
[21:00] girl and bow said Mary was filled with
[21:03] older they were people back there filled
[21:05] with the Holy Ghost and I'm not gonna
[21:07] call them anointed one I'm gonna say
[21:09] it's true I believe David was filled
[21:12] with the Holy Ghost when he killed
[21:13] Goliath and the buyer and the Giant and
[21:15] I thought yeah but that's not a new
[21:17] birth that's what we've been through and
[21:22] see so then the new birth until it's
[21:25] completed you do not have eternal life
[21:28] that's what I'm talking about Wednesday
[21:29] night I used some quotes that brother
[21:34] branham even related eternal life into
[21:36] it but it was only the reason fact that
[21:39] I put it out there because I'm not gonna
[21:41] be like these other preachers and just
[21:42] you know Wellington and I better leave
[21:47] that out you know you give me any quote
[21:50] and I'll I'll read it at least
[21:53] I mean I'll read it you know and you
[21:58] know do the best I can you know - on
[22:02] Wednesday night I said Billy Graham and
[22:05] I used it as two witnesses but I wasn't
[22:07] talking about talking about Billy Graham
[22:09] and all Roberts not talking about the
[22:11] two witnesses to Israel I hope everybody
[22:13] was understanding that that it was not
[22:15] talking about the two witnesses to
[22:17] Israel it was talking about those two
[22:20] they were chosen of Oral Roberts and
[22:23] Billy Graham all right but at least it
[22:25] pays you know and that's know you're
[22:27] listening you know but now think about
[22:30] it
[22:32] your new birth begins when you believe
[22:36] and see that would be when you repent of
[22:39] your sins
[22:39] that would be justification and then you
[22:44] could move up and you can top this with
[22:46] that or whatever and brother Brown says
[22:48] your begotten and sanctification so you
[22:52] could talk about the born-again
[22:54] experience because he the way I believe
[23:00] it in this age now than any other ages
[23:03] brother Branham would
[23:04] things alright and he would show that
[23:09] Luther nem just had justification but
[23:13] now I've always taught you
[23:14] I believe Luther's justification was the
[23:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[23:19] all right now for Luther to get the
[23:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[23:24] let me say it this way were to be back
[23:26] in your lap if you think Luther didn't
[23:29] get the baptism with the Holy Ghost he
[23:31] only got justifications not in the body
[23:32] of Christ because you can't be in the
[23:34] body of Christ until you're born into
[23:37] the body of Christ by the new world see
[23:41] Luther's justification was the new birth
[23:44] which meant in his life do you think
[23:47] Luther didn't repent come on you think
[23:51] Luther didn't repent you think Luther
[23:53] didn't try to change things
[23:56] wouldn't it be justification
[23:58] sanctification and then when it struck
[24:02] him what was Luther's new birth well
[24:09] he's out there and he felt it and
[24:10] raindrops he didn't see what was
[24:13] Luther's new birth come on the message
[24:21] of the just shall live by faith was
[24:23] Martin Luther's new birth we're gonna
[24:30] get to it in a little while and come
[24:31] back over again right what is the new
[24:33] verse revelation of Jesus Christ person
[24:35] to you so wouldn't it be the revelation
[24:36] to East Church eight now you want to
[24:39] quote we do I can't there's never been I
[24:41] hadn't found a quote where brother
[24:42] Branham would call Luther on having a
[24:46] new birth you know maybe you found one
[24:48] but I hadn't found one related to
[24:49] exactly that but I do have one where he
[24:51] said Wesley in the message of the new
[24:55] birth of sanctification well see then if
[24:59] Wesley got the baptism when the if
[25:01] Wesley got the new birth then what did
[25:03] he get he repented of his sins he was
[25:07] justified he come to the message of
[25:10] sanctification he was cleansed and then
[25:15] he believed and he talked
[25:17] I've got his writings Wesley told that
[25:21] that baptism of the Holy Ghost was the
[25:24] sanctification you know what that's true
[25:29] it is the Holy Ghost that sanctifies you
[25:33] but the problem was there they related
[25:36] it to the blood
[25:38] let's see brother Branham then when
[25:41] you're coming through you said well you
[25:42] don't have a quote for this do I need a
[25:46] quote when a prophet says the new birth
[25:49] is justification same case in the
[25:50] baptism when old ago and he said
[25:54] everybody's born into the body of Christ
[25:55] has to be born in the body of Christ by
[25:57] the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[25:59] everybody come in - it doesn't matter
[26:01] what age you would be in hey it wouldn't
[26:06] matter what ages you're in it's the new
[26:09] birth of that age but it's related to
[26:15] where it comes into this age that you
[26:18] come into the three stages which is
[26:20] necessary because Luther had to just
[26:22] shall live by faith Wesley had
[26:24] sanctification but the Pentecostals had
[26:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[26:31] the new birth and brother Branham will
[26:34] call it exactly like the day of
[26:36] Pentecost see then you have to argue
[26:41] with him you're not arguing with me but
[26:43] the point of what I'm trying to say is
[26:44] are we believing the truth see then if
[26:51] we doubt the truth can I quote the
[26:53] Prophet he says that spirit don't agree
[26:56] with the word I thought that was the
[27:00] evidence what do they were do you agree
[27:03] with me or not but if I read the word
[27:05] you got to agree to that I mean you
[27:09] ain't got no choice Dyer well I don't
[27:11] understand why he I don't I just know
[27:13] we'll see now you're doubting him and
[27:19] see by doubting him you'll doubt God
[27:24] which is what I'm trying to say
[27:26] Wednesday night what your new birth
[27:29] starts when you believe
[27:32] but he's not completed even in the new
[27:38] birth of the time enough it's not
[27:39] completed at that time so you're
[27:43] believing on - well then you come to
[27:48] sanctification the unclean spirit going
[27:51] out all of us you're believing on - but
[27:56] then you receive the baptism of the Holy
[27:59] Spirit
[28:04] which is the new birth now you got it
[28:08] correct and you got where the Prophet
[28:11] said it's not God in three parts or
[28:14] whatever etc coming down and he said
[28:16] didn't the father give me this and the
[28:18] Holy Ghost getting he said it's Father
[28:19] Son and Holy Ghost
[28:20] coming in you at one time do you
[28:24] remember that Father Son and Holy Ghost
[28:28] coming into you at one time in the new
[28:31] birth well I don't believe that I
[28:35] believe I just got the Holy Ghost see
[28:37] you don't know what the Holy Ghost is
[28:39] it's one of the prophets said it he said
[28:40] if so been so miss miss interpreter or
[28:44] on not correctly taught until the people
[28:48] don't know what it is but I'm at least
[28:54] trying to take what the prophets said
[28:57] and try to get us stirred up in a way of
[29:01] understanding - word that we don't lock
[29:07] down on I've done this now anything you
[29:11] say you done he's got to be outside the
[29:17] new birth now if you're gonna count it I
[29:20] mean even your repentance cause the
[29:22] goodness of God leads you to it
[29:23] sanctification of the Holy Spirit
[29:24] working in you it's not nothing we do or
[29:28] don't do it's what he's already done and
[29:33] he imparts to you and I then we rejoice
[29:38] then we cry then we shout
[29:45] we're in the days of wind that people
[29:48] are just winning hundreds of millions of
[29:50] dollars on the lottery you know what you
[29:53] could have every one of them numbers
[29:55] right I don't know how many of you do
[29:58] what you do in my business I don't care
[30:00] just making a point you can have all the
[30:03] numbers right and you can line them up
[30:05] in front of you one eight ten one eight
[30:08] seven six if I you know line them up
[30:12] they could call you up and say yo well
[30:15] you got what I got for it be to be to be
[30:16] to be to be well you've won the lottery
[30:27] you got the lottery you don't want it
[30:29] you got the balls ladies brother
[30:31] whatever it takes then you start
[30:35] hollering right then you start rejoicing
[30:41] before then you had them in your hand
[30:44] you occurred them around we've for a
[30:46] while but you didn't know what you had
[30:50] but didn't it come to a place if you
[30:53] realize something took place I'm sure
[30:57] that would be the way wouldn't it today
[30:58] I mean this 1 million dollars I never
[31:01] played the lottery don't care about it
[31:02] but if they just walked in here today
[31:04] and handed out papers and said we're
[31:07] gonna give you this lottery ticket for a
[31:10] million dollars any of you take it
[31:20] and you know what they wouldn't be good

[32:56] word to pull that now don't do that I
[33:00] deliberately I got sir tickler old
[33:02] brother Don riddle I used to like to
[33:04] watch him over other Don ruddle he he'd
[33:07] back up and he backed off platform down
[33:09] it ladies were one time turned the whole
[33:10] thing over

[33:32] learned a long time ago I look in the
[33:35] eye then you say brother Dale you look
[33:37] me nice that's good I looked everybody
[33:39] in the church at night so I'm talking
[33:40] about everybody do you think I'm talking
[33:42] about you yeah yeah yeah I'm talking
[33:45] about you come talk about everybody in
[33:46] the building okay solve the problem
[33:49] listen then if we believe that
[33:57] justification sanctification the baptism
[33:59] of the Holy Ghost is the new birth for
[34:01] the age that we're living in time which
[34:04] was the new birth on the Susur Street
[34:06] which we have the same Holy Ghost that
[34:08] came under Zeus history in the new birth
[34:11] or we don't have it but now listen but
[34:21] when you're justify when you're repented
[34:24] and you start believing what do you
[34:28] brother Brown called it we gave it
[34:29] Wednesday night you potentially what's
[34:32] the potential you asked me for an oak
[34:35] tree I'll give you an acre you know how
[34:37] that oak tree but you got the potential
[34:39] of it
[34:40] you've got wanted to take to make it so
[34:43] if you if your justification don't get
[34:46] this and then we'll get on today's man
[34:47] if your justification is believing on
[34:50] the Lord Jesus Christ and it's true if
[34:54] that believe in will continue on
[34:57] following the word it'll go right
[35:01] through sanctification and believe in
[35:04] the work it'll go right into the baptism
[35:07] of the Holy Ghost all right now listen
[35:10] what I'm saying so you can't have the
[35:12] baptism the Holy Ghost unless you have a
[35:13] stark there's everybody women you gotta
[35:16] have a start you don't just jump and run
[35:19] in the book and the Holy Ghost just
[35:21] Falls are you out in the yard the Holy
[35:24] Ghost just Falls no you're gonna have to
[35:28] go through justification sanctification
[35:30] baptism one whole girl called how would
[35:31] you describe a woman having a baby well
[35:35] you never know the man but she had two
[35:36] babies other day they used to tell that
[35:40] about a lady in my brother he was
[35:41] talking code he didn't believe in the
[35:42] virgin birth once a Methodist preacher
[35:44] and he's telling me one day he said why
[35:46] they were
[35:46] the neighbor down there he said she had
[35:47] a baby never known a man I see she lied
[35:50] that was all I said - I said she lied
[35:54] solves problem all right but listen
[35:59] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[36:03] thou shalt be saved now if that
[36:08] believing continues own it will produce
[36:11] the new birth right the C Church I can
[36:19] go all the way one message I may do it
[36:22] some of this afternoon but I want you to
[36:25] think you realized it by believing on -
[36:29] that's the most marvelous thing could
[36:32] happen to an individual do you realize
[36:36] do you realize in a religious Society of
[36:42] what may be 1 billion I'm just saying it
[36:47] for a number maybe 1 billion proclaim
[36:51] Christians I mean you know whatever
[36:56] number you want to put there you may
[36:57] know what is it I'm just giving a number
[37:00] on me and it wouldn't make no difference
[37:03] but they're confessing Christians are
[37:08] you gonna tell them they're not
[37:09] Christians see that's where the people
[37:14] of this man sit on you don't believe
[37:15] this match that you're lost
[37:17] I believe if you have the genuine new
[37:26] birth it will lead you to the Word of
[37:29] God I believe that always believed that
[37:33] it led me there and I didn't even have
[37:35] it as a new birth I just had it at
[37:39] justification and sanctification I
[37:41] believe that because I know what God
[37:43] done for me and I know what happened and
[37:48] see then once you're getting it to the
[37:53] basis that if you believe that it's
[37:55] justification of sanctification the
[37:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost and let me
[37:59] quote right around here
[38:00] said the life's three ages because he
[38:03] brought the ages down and he said the
[38:05] life story ages completed to birth huh
[38:08] see because it went through
[38:10] justification st. Kate's the baptism
[38:12] with old ago let's see if you're like a
[38:16] lot of people say it well say them then
[38:18] people who suits the street didn't how
[38:19] no Holy Ghost the run said he did may I
[38:23] quote you a quote from brother Branham
[38:27] when he was referring to those
[38:29] Pentecostal people in their beginning
[38:32] now if you want this and I'll be glad to
[38:35] find it he said they were closer to the
[38:38] coming of the Lord or rapture and when
[38:40] one word or the other he's one of the
[38:43] two guys either rapture coming to the
[38:45] Lord he said they were closer than we
[38:46] are all they had was gifts and signs of
[38:57] profit ever come on the scene or
[39:00] anything you know why because they were
[39:03] happy about what they had they rejoiced
[39:08] on what they had they were glad to say
[39:12] that they were Christians that Rotten
[39:15] Tomatoes thrown at him
[39:16] but there were Trinitarians but they
[39:22] still got the new birth
[39:23] well the ring called it's a new birth of
[39:26] the age what are we going to realize
[39:31] it's like I told you the the big brother
[39:34] that said there you know that he
[39:36] couldn't preach era he stood right down
[39:38] and goes wool and said that they're Zeus
[39:40] the street Pentecost was false and I
[39:42] brought the quote to him from brother
[39:44] Branham he come right here to the church
[39:47] and preach that Azusa Street was false
[39:50] no problem to me I'm not against him I
[39:53] told him down there I told my co brother
[39:57] Brad said that that this illusive street
[39:59] had the baptism and Holy Ghost just like
[40:00] the day of Pentecost see you think I'm
[40:06] against those fears no I love the people
[40:08] I'd love to to dissin grab somebody like
[40:10] that and just pack it in and
[40:13] enjoy it till at least something got
[40:15] down in them but that's up to them
[40:17] That's not me and you I ain't said he
[40:20] was lost
[40:21] I'm said he was misunderstanding the
[40:25] rental didn't say those nine hundred
[40:27] different beliefs of the new birth was
[40:29] lost he said there was misunderstanding
[40:35] you know the God went through the
[40:37] ignorant Bible says but you know the
[40:39] rest of that scripture has to come in
[40:41] this day he said but then he commanded
[40:43] all to repent see so we have no excuse
[40:45] now to say well if I don't have maybe
[40:48] I'll make this way over to no no I
[40:50] strive for one time if God wants me to
[40:53] be a foolish virgin that's his business
[40:55] I'm like brother branham I settled that
[40:58] a long time ago but around him I believe
[41:01] he meant it he said God wants me to be a
[41:03] happy she had a devil he said I'll be a
[41:05] good one so you better know what word
[41:13] says it's up to you alright but now
[41:17] listen your new birth starts when you
[41:21] believe and continues own will come out
[41:27] to the baptism because you don't get the
[41:30] baptism when you repent so it's not
[41:33] dividing up you get this when you repent
[41:36] the new bars and then you get the
[41:38] born-again experience and then you get
[41:39] the baptism I ain't saying that I'm just
[41:42] saying one thing you got a distance to
[41:44] go through from where you start to where
[41:46] they come to and it's finished by the
[41:48] Holy Spirit because remember now your
[41:52] disciples were justified and sanctified
[41:55] for three and a half years before they
[42:02] receive the baptism so there's growth
[42:06] developments in there where that
[42:08] scripture says being born again I know
[42:10] where it's placed in the pyramid we will
[42:12] get to that but you know what the day
[42:14] you really believe you're being born
[42:16] again because you're in a stage you're
[42:20] just like a baby that's eating and
[42:22] pushing out the more you eat the more
[42:24] you push out
[42:27] huh all of us done that pretty good
[42:30] I think getting away me and dad up I got
[42:32] some life but now listen you don't have
[42:38] eternal life the minute you believe but
[42:42] you have a confession
[42:46] alright now think about it as I was
[42:49] saying our moment ago think about a
[42:51] world think about just a million people
[42:54] in the world as Christians I'm sure we
[42:58] run into at least 1 billion I remember
[43:01] he used to be 500,000 Catholic that was
[43:03] 50 years ago no but now listen are you
[43:09] gonna say all that's lost remember the
[43:19] Bible says to be careful how you judge
[43:26] because remember the rest of that par
[43:29] phrase in the scripture what does it say
[43:31] you'll be judged by once you judge is
[43:34] that plain sense all right we say then
[43:37] people are lost well what about the
[43:40] foolish virgins they're believers unto
[43:49] they just don't get to possession of the
[43:51] Holy Ghost to come and live in them but
[43:54] they're believers untrue I'm gonna say
[44:01] something that's going because I just
[44:02] thought of it it's gonna click on you so
[44:04] listen you know that there no need one
[44:06] it is in a pretty good shape and let
[44:12] them sink a little I don't want to be
[44:18] anointed one why you don't want the Holy
[44:22] Ghost telling you you don't like his
[44:25] presence that's being on you no I walked
[44:30] a new part what I didn't say that I said
[44:36] I won't did Norton I mean oh brother
[44:39] Gary Atkins used to talk a lot you know
[44:40] no brother Gary he said it like this he
[44:43] said brother Dale if me and you and
[44:45] anointed he said we ain't too much
[44:46] anointed I said well I have to agree
[44:49] with you you know what see at least
[44:53] anointed ones are happy in their spirit
[44:57] they have much of dried off in trouble
[44:59] ooh lordy water I don't know I'm
[45:03] wondering what brother Dale trying to
[45:04] say he's been preaching on this for
[45:05] weeks now he's trying to get me to admit
[45:08] I'm lost not gonna admit I'm lost I'm a
[45:10] baby but I ain't gonna admit it well
[45:16] that's up to you
[45:19] that's up to you I'm just preaching the
[45:22] gospel but trying to preach it in the
[45:25] way that'll make you and I think about
[45:29] our experience cause anything you name
[45:33] Satan can personate all right we're
[45:36] trying to get into evening morning
[45:38] evening yeah anything you can bring can
[45:43] be impersonated you agree you agree
[45:48] that's the way the Prophet told it
[45:50] anything that you can think of Urdu or
[45:52] whatever could be impersonating but it's
[45:54] just one thing can't be impersonating
[45:59] and number one time it can't be
[46:01] impersonating
[46:02] now I know the quote sometimes we hold
[46:04] on the point he said he can't be the
[46:06] holy ghost we know that when he could be
[46:10] so close until he can have his own
[46:11] anointing and then you got to deal with
[46:13] the Anointed One falling in line so
[46:15] don't go that way what's the one thing
[46:17] that the devil can't do he can't bring
[46:21] the word word by word now you tell me
[46:27] anything else I just said it now prophet
[46:32] said he can't be the Holy Ghost we know
[46:34] that he can't be God we know that with
[46:38] everything down below though he can do
[46:40] anything he can impersonate any gift and
[46:43] run around and said he can even pass out
[46:46] supernatural gifts he said the devil
[46:50] could well I got this gift it's like I
[46:55] told one brother I said you know what's
[46:57] the problem were you and your girl he
[46:59] said what I said you letting it get in
[47:01] the way I still mean it I love him I
[47:05] still mean it is just getting away
[47:07] because gifts can get in your way
[47:09] because you can say well what do you
[47:11] mean now what do you what do they want
[47:13] me to do he's a dried bone dried ain't
[47:16] got no spirit about him no nothing he
[47:18] want me to act like that no no no I want
[47:23] you to I want you to be whatever God
[47:27] wants you to be I want you to shout when
[47:31] God won't see this guy cry when God
[47:33] wants you to cry the Prophet said a
[47:36] church without the gift without the
[47:38] answer to God I want to give let's see
[47:49] it wound up in do zakat all you got to
[47:51] do the word don't worry about - we're
[47:52] going correct everything he's that rider
[47:54] does the word correct the era and one
[47:58] brother he was you know was here and I'm
[48:00] not throwing off on him but he started
[48:03] speaking in tongues some of the people
[48:04] start saying well is he is he speaking
[48:08] in tongues that's a no he's speaking
[48:09] Spanish
[48:12] well that speaking into okay you know
[48:15] why I said that because I had talked to
[48:17] it and he sets up I said you ain't doing
[48:21] nothing in order look what I was putting
[48:22] myself on I said you ain't doing nothing
[48:25] the world was speaking in Spanish unless
[48:28] you got the people thinking you're
[48:29] speaking in tongues you're speaking in
[48:30] Spanish boy he got so mad he laughed
[48:34] well you know it must have been right
[48:37] what I said but you see we don't want to
[48:43] go with the world as straight as it is
[48:45] by the prophets message there's not a
[48:50] person in this world that does not have
[48:52] some way or thought about them to my
[48:56] Christian world about the salvation and
[48:59] want to have it you tell me you don't
[49:03] have a rule I'm gonna arguing I'm just
[49:05] telling you that you do you got
[49:08] something you relate to and praise God
[49:12] you need an anchor as I said Wednesday
[49:16] Drive it down and tell the devil right
[49:19] there it is
[49:24] but you see we believe unto eternal life
[49:30] all right we stopped it to end of the
[49:32] message by saying that we would get to
[49:34] the basis that we would bring out that
[49:39] the Bible says no man that Scripture we
[49:41] read and I told you you go in the
[49:44] message of the hour in the computer and
[49:46] you run in God is that you run in that
[49:50] scripture where it's talking about oh no
[49:59] man can say the Bible doesn't say no man
[50:02] can call brother Branham the biggest
[50:05] portion of his doing
[50:06] I think it's 24 times I believe it's
[50:08] right now it's more than that because I
[50:10] got that many but he used for that
[50:14] scripture he would say no man can call
[50:17] when the Bible doesn't say that reading
[50:20] I say those things because you go into
[50:22] the computer people to do and they well
[50:24] I can't find before
[50:27] they've like 4 times worth it says then
[50:31] if you can't say no man can say is used
[50:34] about 4 times others you can't it's the
[50:36] same word
[50:37] it's the same tall but I'm giving you
[50:42] that to where you won't run in there and
[50:44] see I do a lot of blocking of demons and
[50:47] there thank God I know how they work
[50:50] like I told you when we've got I first
[50:52] got the computer from from brother or
[50:54] Havilah you know and I bought the
[50:57] computer and the message and he give
[50:58] everything in me and Anna we went sit
[51:01] down for two or three days cause back
[51:03] then you just had these little dish and
[51:04] you put them in had to run them had to
[51:06] run them had to run him out to run it
[51:07] wasn't this one flop it in that's done
[51:09] it took us about two days to run that
[51:12] thing in and when we got through and I
[51:15] said run a search Daddy and let's see
[51:17] what it does I topped in SCR P how do
[51:21] you spell it a into your which one is
[51:24] right yeah into your ent serpent it's
[51:27] the RP a into you exactly spelling I
[51:29] topped ent every which one it was my top
[51:32] didn't come up 0 I said now I spent
[51:36] $3,500 and we got two days running this
[51:39] sucker in and how many times did brother
[51:42] Brown use the word serpent and I looked
[51:46] at me and said daddy it's a change of
[51:48] spelling
[51:52] okay I do the things to try to keep you
[51:56] from running up into something and then
[51:59] you back up and said well I can't find
[52:01] that you may not can find that you have
[52:05] to go some other way because brother
[52:08] branham had like he said no man can say
[52:12] and see that won't come up but then when
[52:17] he says no man can say it and it'll come
[52:19] up like four times or whatever I just
[52:22] give you that to save your time I don't
[52:24] sorry because I'm a human being you know
[52:27] what I'm sitting there in front of the
[52:31] computer thinking God how in the world
[52:32] can I explain this what can I do
[52:38] all right so then we get to the point
[52:43] that of what we ended up saying that we
[52:48] would deal today with the fact of the
[52:50] Bible saying that no man can call Jesus
[52:52] a cross are can say that Jesus is Christ
[52:55] except be by the Holy Ghost
[52:57] all right now all right then what are
[53:02] you saying then bro deal at
[53:05] justification you started your new birth
[53:09] or born again experience come on if
[53:14] born-again experience you know would be
[53:15] we use the new birth but we tell him at
[53:17] the morning any spirit knows what the
[53:19] morning experience what what did brother
[53:20] branham except described of Jesus
[53:22] talking to Nicodemus that you better be
[53:25] born by water and blood and time and he
[53:27] said that's justification sanctification
[53:28] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[53:31] it's the born-again experience all right
[53:35] now before in the early ministry or
[53:39] after brother Branham held one point he
[53:44] would always talk about justification
[53:48] sanctification baptism with Holy Ghost
[53:49] and that would be your new birth or
[53:52] would bring you to the baptism huh and
[53:56] when it does then it leaves us the basis
[54:02] that we've got to say that and believe
[54:03] it and like I said you can spend all day
[54:08] long trying to prove
[54:10] new birth and then this one over here
[54:11] the baptism and you can pull all you
[54:13] want to and study all you want to and
[54:15] sell you want to but when you come back
[54:16] to the point you don't come to one time
[54:20] your new birth begins when you believe
[54:30] you're born again experience begins when
[54:32] you believe but the baptism of the Holy
[54:36] Ghost is not your believing the baptism
[54:39] of the Holy Ghost is when he has
[54:41] accepted your believing and gives you
[54:45] the new birth we call them come on what
[54:47] are we talking about Abraham what is
[54:49] this thing abraham believed God and it
[54:51] was imputed unto him and all the Baptist
[54:53] jump onto that you know all Abraham
[54:55] could do was believe these bread run
[54:56] said that's true that's true and that's
[54:59] right
[55:00] he said but God done something to
[55:03] Abraham said he gave him circumcision as
[55:06] a sign see he accepted to believing of
[55:11] Abraham and gave him circumcision all
[55:15] right your justification chopped off you
[55:18] pass in sanctification is the cleansing
[55:21] and setting aside but then the baptism
[55:25] is what God does when he gives you his
[55:29] own life to come and live in you now
[55:34] there's where the problem is actually
[55:36] what I've tried to explain for 40 years
[55:39] because see that sanctification of stage
[55:42] is the most dangerous place to ever be
[55:45] in your Christian experience I spent
[55:48] knowingly knowingly in this message two
[55:52] years Sirkin God for the baptism in the
[55:55] Holy Ghost I didn't come into it so when
[56:00] I'm in the message that's what brother
[56:01] told me one day he said you believe the
[56:03] Prophet don't see that's the other devil
[56:06] did too he believed him what you see you
[56:18] get into that sanctified stage and if
[56:21] the Prophet said it's like a baby be
[56:23] gotten into the wound of her mother he
[56:25] said it's wiggling muscles it's all kind
[56:27] of thing he said but there's no laughter
[56:28] and he was explaining it right no
[56:31] laughter he said then when the baby
[56:34] comes forth and God breathed into his
[56:36] nostrils it becomes a living soul all
[56:40] right in that sanctified state
[56:43] you can move in to an anointed one real
[56:46] easy don't you think Satan's right there
[56:53] when you try to make some commitment and
[56:57] do something don't you think he's right
[56:59] with you
[57:00] didn't he tell him in the upper room
[57:02] come on okay
[57:05] didn't he tell him in the upper room now
[57:07] who was it doing the talking we just say
[57:09] it was one of them cuz we don't want to
[57:10] name who - who right brother Ron didn't
[57:12] say we if it's one of them but what did
[57:15] that one of them motivated by you say oh
[57:20] no the devil wasn't in the upper room
[57:21] come on get out of it
[57:25] somebody said we got it right somebody
[57:33] said we got it one of them had to be
[57:36] smart enough to say wait a minute we
[57:38] ain't got what he said so we better hold
[57:40] off now who was that doing that the
[57:44] devil the devil in the minds of those
[57:48] people but when that Holy Ghost failed
[57:54] Satan just walked out because he knew
[57:58] that he was doing night because he could
[58:02] no longer get back in all right remember
[58:05] you're sealed in he sealed out yeah but
[58:09] today he said no he said do you'd have
[58:11] to go out to him you remember that one
[58:13] you would have to go out to him he said
[58:15] cause he can't come unto you so then I
[58:19] could go out to him in my spirit in my
[58:21] body and do a lot of wrong with that
[58:24] inward part with we've been through
[58:26] things okay listen
[58:31] so then we know for a surety I gave it
[58:36] to you so go ahead we'll use number one
[58:38] then we drop back to one eye okay we'll
[58:40] get a few of these we ain't gonna get
[58:42] nothing like what we need but number one
[58:45] I'll give you this one over and over
[58:47] it's free saving the other questions
[58:50] answered on the Hebrews and What did he
[58:52] say
[58:52] no by one spirit talking about we're all
[58:56] baptized
[58:57] into one body see that isn't when the
[59:01] nuber begins
[59:02] see the baptism and is on over the new
[59:07] birth begins when you believe on the
[59:09] Lord Jesus Christ or the Lord Jesus now

[1:00:37] show you that brother Branham can put
[1:00:39] the new birth the born-again experience
[1:00:41] and the baptism when the Holy Ghost in
[1:00:44] one paragraph and he's talking about one
[1:00:46] time the new birth the baptism of the
[1:00:49] Holy Ghost the born-again experience and
[1:00:52] it is all one in the same
[1:00:59] come on go ahead to 1a now which is the
[1:01:04] hidden no wait a minute hearing
[1:01:06] recognizing and acting anyone knows that
[1:01:10] the seal of God is the birthright
[1:01:12] another 1960 anyone knows that the seal
[1:01:17] of God is the birthright the baptism of
[1:01:20] the Holy Ghost
[1:01:21] what is the birthright the baptism in
[1:01:23] the whole fee since 4:30 says grieve not
[1:01:25] the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're
[1:01:27] sealed till the day of your redemption
[1:01:30] when you were born again he's gonna use
[1:01:33] birthright don't use baptism when you
[1:01:36] were born again or say excuse me when
[1:01:39] they were born again they were filled
[1:01:41] with the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is
[1:01:43] the new birth we know that you're
[1:01:45] begotten of the Spirit I admit that but
[1:01:48] until you're born now he's missing right
[1:01:50] in one paragraph the baptism in the Holy
[1:01:53] Ghost the birth right the new birth the
[1:01:57] born-again experience just all in the
[1:02:01] same but brother so-and-so said they was
[1:02:05] different okay you you need to get up go
[1:02:10] with brother so-and-so and follow-on cuz
[1:02:13] I ain't got no problem okay look at the
[1:02:17] next one 1964 God's provided way for
[1:02:20] this day
[1:02:22] go ahead to number one be that's the way
[1:02:29] man how to do today not be herded in by
[1:02:32] some denominational coupe but come in
[1:02:36] the way God said come in by the baptism
[1:02:39] of the Holy Ghost and the nuber swarming
[1:02:42] revival not Church joining solicited
[1:02:46] from door to door and passing magazines
[1:02:48] but a birth being born again
[1:02:51] théo were the Holy Ghost God's Way
[1:02:55] freeing himself from the world right
[1:02:57] believing believing God's Word
[1:03:03] [Music]
[1:03:07] now brother branham i gave it to you in
[1:03:10] the church age book where he's talking
[1:03:11] about the Holy Ghost and the baptism and
[1:03:13] things let's see wait a minute I mean
[1:03:16] yeah I've got it that I didn't give him
[1:03:18] this one now this is the church age book
[1:03:22] page 144 Smyrna and church age I read
[1:03:26] this over and over to you but he's
[1:03:27] coming down explaining what's happening
[1:03:29] when he gives the services and they're
[1:03:31] already getting it getting it up so we
[1:03:34] will have to get or the last part of it
[1:03:36] come on up
[1:03:41] okay thank you man what's what he said
[1:03:44] this has caused a great deal of
[1:03:46] confusion because he'd given older call
[1:03:48] and people would come to the DAR and
[1:03:51] he's wanting them to come to be born
[1:03:53] again and he'd give an altar call and
[1:03:55] they've come to get him to speak in
[1:03:56] tongues and do this at another cause
[1:03:58] they had already thought is born again
[1:03:59] or believed it or done that so listen
[1:04:01] this has caused a great deal of
[1:04:03] confusion I want to tell you exactly
[1:04:04] what I mean I mean for the center to
[1:04:07] come forward and be born again which is
[1:04:09] to be baptized into the body of Christ
[1:04:12] by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what
[1:04:15] took place at Pentecost when the church
[1:04:17] was launched in other words to be born
[1:04:20] of the Spirit is to be truly baptized
[1:04:23] with the Holy Ghost it is one in the
[1:04:25] same so the new birth the baptism of the
[1:04:32] Holy Ghost
[1:04:32] the morning is written the baptism the
[1:04:34] Holy Ghost is one in the same now I've
[1:04:37] went through it over and over I don't
[1:04:38] you could say and I said it the new
[1:04:41] birth starts when you believe you're
[1:04:43] born again experience could start when
[1:04:44] you believe with the baptism don't start
[1:04:47] when you believe the baptisms when God
[1:04:49] accepts your believing gives you his
[1:04:52] that's the difference in it are they
[1:04:55] going to the next one 147 excuse okay
[1:05:00] we'll get that let me read this just
[1:05:03] leave that up Aaron we'll get to it 147
[1:05:05] of the summer in church AIDS he said to
[1:05:07] understand this is to clear a twice
[1:05:09] tutors have never found Paul saying at
[1:05:12] any time be born again and then be
[1:05:16] spirit filled he says never been fine
[1:05:20] they have inferred it is there and they
[1:05:24] have put their own meaning to it to make
[1:05:28] it say it but scripture does not say
[1:05:31] that Jesus never said it neither now
[1:05:37] we'll get to this one okay wait a minute
[1:05:43] number three okay we'll read this one
[1:05:48] hearing acting recognizing on the Word
[1:05:51] of God
[1:05:52] I wish you'd pay close attention to the
[1:05:54] years as we go along
[1:05:59] pay close attention to the years as we
[1:06:01] go along and you'll see that he's not
[1:06:04] changing his doctrine but he is and he's
[1:06:07] not correcting it cause he didn't need
[1:06:09] to correct but he's bringing it into
[1:06:12] line to word that it shows better it's
[1:06:15] like I've tried to explain to you the
[1:06:18] early part I got it in here explain the
[1:06:21] early part of road runs ministry he
[1:06:23] would explain the trial and being that's
[1:06:25] what body soul and spirit he did not use
[1:06:31] it in every case in a line of it but he
[1:06:33] was basically using it in 65 he says
[1:06:37] body spirit and soul he didn't have to
[1:06:43] correct it because he always gave his
[1:06:45] senses for the first man outside see
[1:06:49] taste fields fell in here second man is
[1:06:51] memory reason conscious affection the
[1:06:53] third man is the inner our center man we
[1:06:57] see the faith or doubt he didn't have to
[1:07:00] change no doctrines or thoughts but they
[1:07:05] were statements he made that made it
[1:07:08] look like because that's where you - so
[1:07:11] people come in and got - so be in the
[1:07:13] nature of the Spirit and etc etcetera
[1:07:14] that's where they came in at because
[1:07:16] they wouldn't put the soul as a sin
[1:07:18] around they put the spirit as a center
[1:07:24] in had that soul change remember the
[1:07:26] Bible doesn't say I'll give you a new
[1:07:27] soul I will said I'll give you a new
[1:07:29] spirit right
[1:07:32] anyone knows that's a seal of God it's a
[1:07:34] birthright didn't we read down there's a
[1:07:40] new bird yeah I think we doesn't read
[1:07:42] that okay we're ready don't matter and
[1:07:48] anyone knows that the seal of God is the
[1:07:50] burnt drop the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:51] Spirit these is 4:30 we ready whereby
[1:07:53] you sealed until the day of your
[1:07:54] Redemption when they were born again
[1:07:56] they were filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:07:58] the Holy Spirit is the new birth we know
[1:08:00] that all right you're begotten of the
[1:08:02] spirit of sanctification all right now I
[1:08:05] want to get about to right here and then
[1:08:07] we'll just quit till this evening okay
[1:08:10] hold on to your notes because here we're
[1:08:15] going to deal with something that and
[1:08:18] they don't have their they have TNA 10 a
[1:08:22] something that I've always taught and I
[1:08:26] still believe it needs more teaching
[1:08:31] that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a
[1:08:35] revelation the new birth is a revelation
[1:08:41] the born-again experience is a
[1:08:43] revelation if they're all three one in
[1:08:47] the same I don't care if you want to put
[1:08:51] one of them over here and one over here
[1:08:53] and try to work it through that that's
[1:08:54] your being it I try to work it through
[1:08:55] nothing I'm just saying they're one in
[1:08:57] the same then when you receive the new
[1:09:01] birth you get you get that baptism of
[1:09:02] the Holy Spirit you have a run around
[1:09:04] and said yeah I know it I've got to
[1:09:05] quote but listen to him enable rolled up
[1:09:14] a rock this is off the message of faith
[1:09:16] something made him a church or worship
[1:09:18] when when they will come and watch you
[1:09:22] he by faith faith is something that's
[1:09:25] faith isn't something that's imaginary
[1:09:28] thing I want you to get it faith is a
[1:09:31] direct revelation now Abel the point I'm
[1:09:35] sorting is here we start in the garden
[1:09:37] Abel starts by revelation
[1:09:44] right he didn't start shouting speaking
[1:09:47] in tongues and will rattle ouya he
[1:09:50] started at a revelation then he was born
[1:09:56] in his mama's blood from his daddy's
[1:09:58] blood that's why he brought around the
[1:09:59] Express now watch him because I want you
[1:10:05] to get it faith is a direct revelation
[1:10:07] and if you only accept Christ as your
[1:10:11] Savior about an intellectual you haven't
[1:10:19] got it yet you cannot say that Jesus is
[1:10:23] the Christ until the Holy Spirit has
[1:10:26] revealed it to you now they're in it so
[1:10:30] we read a lot of what did Peter say when
[1:10:34] Jesus who said who demands out us on a
[1:10:35] man he said darting to Christ the Son of
[1:10:37] the Living God what did he say to Peter
[1:10:39] he said on this rock I'll build my
[1:10:41] church and the gates of Hell cannot
[1:10:44] prevail against that and Bertrand said
[1:10:47] your church is built on Revelation right
[1:10:52] come on
[1:10:55] see intellectual faith boy if I only get
[1:10:58] that one point right now to go down home
[1:11:01] and Everhart I'm thankful for this place
[1:11:03] position right faith is not something
[1:11:05] mentally perceived but it is a
[1:11:08] revelation a revelation of God by faith
[1:11:11] not intellectual but by his heart a
[1:11:16] revelation okay going to the next one
[1:11:20] we'll pick up a couple mineral quit
[1:11:22] their words to end be which is the
[1:11:26] message it is I you find that by digging
[1:11:34] through the eyes of the frozen thing you
[1:11:38] know God is a revelation it was a
[1:11:41] revelation at the beginning who told
[1:11:45] Abel that he should offer a lamb instead
[1:11:48] of Cain with the fruit who told
[1:11:55] drop down to bottom of it there's more
[1:11:57] than quote it's a spiritual revelation
[1:12:03] who Jesus Christ is
[1:12:07] he's nuts first person second person
[1:12:09] third person he's no person he is the
[1:12:11] person
[1:12:13] it's a spiritual revelation who Jesus is
[1:12:16] upon this rock God revealing not by
[1:12:19] learning by a word not by some Creed but
[1:12:23] by a spiritual revelation that Jesus is
[1:12:26] the Christ the Son of God that's
[1:12:28] revealed to you by the Holy Spirit can I
[1:12:32] make a personal point can I remind
[1:12:37] somebody that told me that they were
[1:12:42] standing in their kitchen and said a
[1:12:47] voice spoke and said that's one God you
[1:12:56] don't mind me say that he sister Gail
[1:12:59] something spoke and said that's one God
[1:13:08] now I'd rather have that as an
[1:13:11] experience than all the shouting
[1:13:16] screaming hollering signs and wonders
[1:13:18] dead raised sick healed I'd rather have
[1:13:22] that one little statement because
[1:13:26] remember what happened to Abel Cain had
[1:13:30] an intellectual right come on even I've
[1:13:35] heard pre-funded message and I rebuked
[1:13:37] him about trying to say it but that
[1:13:38] don't do no good they're gonna preciate
[1:13:40] it anyway the word the Bible said that
[1:13:43] Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice
[1:13:45] since either Cain's sacrifice was
[1:13:48] excellent but Abel's was more excellent
[1:13:50] I said Cain's sacrifice spoke of works
[1:13:52] his salvation
[1:13:54] they eat no salvation in works they
[1:13:57] didn't change the person from saying
[1:13:58] that what you see Abel it was revealed
[1:14:04] to him he got a knowledge but not just a
[1:14:09] head knowledge because Kane's head
[1:14:11] knowledge was pretty good he was pretty
[1:14:15] good he worked itself to death he got
[1:14:16] turned on all they can do to bring in
[1:14:19] the fruit because he thought it was
[1:14:20] fruit and he offered the fruit and Abel
[1:14:28] says okay it's not to add said God spoke
[1:14:34] to me and said to go offer a lamb maybe
[1:14:40] God didn't say no more than able offer a
[1:14:42] lamb the rest of it was in maybe the
[1:14:46] thoughts of Abel when Abel said look
[1:14:48] something else got to happen then it
[1:14:50] wouldn't nothing mom and daddy ate it
[1:14:53] wouldn't know gifts and signs and
[1:14:54] wonders are speaking in tongues and
[1:14:55] shouting and crying he wouldn't none of
[1:14:57] that something happen instead it's
[1:15:02] revealed to me now what happened I'd
[1:15:06] rather have Abel's revelation and all
[1:15:08] the works of Cain
[1:15:12] because you know what I've always told
[1:15:14] you I'll just read it then we'll get
[1:15:17] back this evening
[1:15:18] what if I always talk to you we'll
[1:15:23] review and then start over again
[1:15:32] yes brother branham a question or the
[1:15:35] question was asking brother Branham what
[1:15:38] is the baptism of the holy spirit self
[1:15:46] cross the mystery of God reveal what is
[1:15:49] brother Branham the new birth you say
[1:15:57] well brother Branham what is the new
[1:15:58] birth it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:16:01] personally to you not you join the
[1:16:06] church you shook a hand
[1:16:08] are you done something different you
[1:16:11] said a great
[1:16:13] you promised to live by a code of rules
[1:16:18] he is the word that was revealed to you
[1:16:23] and plenty more in there because you
[1:16:26] know I've been preaching it for a year
[1:16:27] this is 40 years ain't there's a hatch
[1:16:29] up you you'll say that I know the human
[1:16:37] mind you can comprehend a little bit but
[1:16:40] a birth of being a revelation and you
[1:16:45] can talk about being born again coming
[1:16:46] up through and you can kind of see a
[1:16:48] growth development by more revelation
[1:16:50] from God but the hardest part for the
[1:16:52] human mind to accept is that the baptism
[1:16:56] of the Holy Ghost is a revelation
[1:17:05] brother branham told you the revelation
[1:17:07] it was a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:17:10] personally to you not a group personally
[1:17:14] to you the new birth wasn't you sitting
[1:17:18] over here and me sitting over yonder and
[1:17:19] we both got it no we could have al but
[1:17:23] I'm you know what I'm illustrating the
[1:17:28] new birth the born-again experience the
[1:17:31] baptism of the whole to go like I said
[1:17:33] it's hard for the mind to comprehend the
[1:17:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost is being a
[1:17:37] revelation but now let me ask you this
[1:17:44] question would not it be a wonderful
[1:17:48] opportunity to be down praying one day
[1:17:54] or something standing in the kitchen
[1:17:57] moppet and just God comes down and
[1:18:03] reveals things to you
[1:18:12] just reveals it it's not that the way
[1:18:17] the Prophet talked about that he'd be
[1:18:20] sitting out under a tree in the woods
[1:18:21] hunting and he said it started coming in
[1:18:24] like 2 + 2 4 - but he said it just keeps
[1:18:26] coming in he said break in divisions he
[1:18:32] said but then sometimes it didn't break
[1:18:33] in division he said it broke into the
[1:18:35] scriptures and he sued scriptures would
[1:18:37] pour in now watch his point he said I
[1:18:40] would not know what the scriptures was
[1:18:42] talking about he said but I go get my
[1:18:46] book and take it and sit down and he
[1:18:48] said in other words he wondered why I
[1:18:49] wrote that he said then here it comes
[1:18:52] why would you not be wondered why would
[1:18:55] it not be a wonderful thing to think
[1:18:57] about living in a world of Revelation
[1:19:05] how many of you I'm not asking you raise
[1:19:08] your hand or anything I'm asking you to
[1:19:10] think how many of you have had a
[1:19:14] revelation that something just come to
[1:19:18] you now did somebody out talk to you
[1:19:20] argued you but something just come to
[1:19:23] you and said just simply that water
[1:19:26] baptism is correct in the name of the
[1:19:31] Lord Jesus Christ you ever had it to
[1:19:36] happen like that just
[1:19:44] have you ever had an experience of
[1:19:46] something being revealed to you were up
[1:19:51] in the garden one day and something had
[1:19:53] happened years ago in a situation and we
[1:19:56] were picking stuff out of the gardener
[1:19:58] doing something and the subject came up
[1:20:00] about to thought what we're dealing with
[1:20:01] and I said this will take place she said
[1:20:09] it will never take place I said if it
[1:20:14] don't take place I will resign from the
[1:20:18] church many of you willing to do that it
[1:20:27] took place the way I said it ain't
[1:20:33] talking about a good thought you know
[1:20:36] what I mean no words you come up is
[1:20:41] sorry about this musicians come up you
[1:20:44] come up and you get people up Donald
[1:20:46] four and they come around and pray for
[1:20:48] somebody and somebody goes walking out
[1:20:50] we're blessed God it was my prayer that
[1:20:52] was heard if I hadn't have been up there
[1:20:55] they wouldn't never got it
[1:20:57] it was my prayer well you know what I'm
[1:21:01] gonna tell you up front that wasn't our
[1:21:03] prior I draw the house son little kid

[1:21:08] took a prayer cloth and placed it around
[1:21:10] and let every man woman child a little
[1:21:12] bitty kids I said little bitty kids you
[1:21:14] take that and pray over it the movie the
[1:21:21] kids might be able to touch God you know
[1:21:25] what it might be theirs but if you come
[1:21:29] up to the point where there's me I done
[1:21:31] I done I've done within you know right
[1:21:32] real quick you didn't do it because that
[1:21:37] is something different it's not God but
[1:21:43] why don't you just walk out sometimes
[1:21:44] and just put it to the basis is saying
[1:21:47] this is the way it's going to be if it
[1:21:49] ain't you know I'm just gonna quit

[1:22:00] the line of what you believe they put
[1:22:02] the gun against your head you ain't know
[1:22:04] how time to think it over the new birth
