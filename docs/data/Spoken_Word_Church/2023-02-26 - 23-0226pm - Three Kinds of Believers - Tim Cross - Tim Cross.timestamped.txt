[11:01] it's so wonderful I just feel right at
[11:04] home here with you all and I just
[11:06] appreciate the goodness of the Lord I
[11:08] couldn't stay in the bullpen any longer
[11:10] I had to come charging out
[11:12] praise the Lord so God bless you where
[11:15] the spirit of the Lord is there's
[11:16] liberty
[11:18] amen so we just feel right at home in
[11:20] his presence this evening and just going
[11:22] to invite you to go right into your
[11:24] Bibles and we'll read from Colossians
[11:26] chapter 3
[11:28] you know what I've got a reputation for
[11:31] being a long-winded preacher and uh as
[11:33] hard as I try brother Samuel I just
[11:36] can't seem to outlive that or move that
[11:38] down but uh and I blame the people for
[11:40] pulling they pulled it right out of me
[11:42] but uh and I joke with some of the uh
[11:46] other ministers friends of mine I said
[11:47] you know I hate to shortchange people
[11:49] they've come all that way and you know
[11:51] it's uh so I hope you don't feel short
[11:53] chains
[11:55] but I guess the the the mind can only
[11:58] contain as much as the seat can sustain
[12:01] so uh some Churches don't have enough
[12:03] patent on the pews for preachers like me
[12:05] but anyway when the Lord is speaking and
[12:09] moving and having his way at time passes
[12:12] very quickly and we just want the Lord
[12:14] to have his way I want to preach this
[12:15] evening on three kinds of Christians and
[12:19] I know brother Adam preached about the
[12:20] make-believer the unbeliever and the
[12:22] True Believer but I'm going to go a
[12:24] little different direction and let's uh
[12:26] just before we read in the scriptures
[12:27] let's approach the author of the word
[12:29] again Heavenly Father Lord we thank you
[12:32] for your goodness and your mercy Lord is
[12:35] the words of that song We're sung Lord
[12:37] all my life
[12:39] Lord you've been faithful you've been
[12:40] merciful and Lord we just we can't help
[12:44] but love you and thank you Father for
[12:47] all that you are to us and as we
[12:49] approach your word this evening we ask
[12:51] you to get Lord to come in our midst and
[12:53] break the bread of life to our hearts
[12:55] Lord make the words come off of these
[12:57] pages and live in our lives and just
[12:59] have your way in our midst this evening
[13:00] be glorified in our midst we thank you
[13:03] for it and ask it in Jesus name we pray
[13:05] amen
[13:06] amen we'll read Colossians chapter 3
[13:09] verses 12 through 17 and then jump down
[13:12] to verse 23.
[13:14] put on therefore down we don't want to
[13:16] be put ons
[13:17] but the Bible says put on therefore as
[13:20] the elect of God holy and beloved bowels
[13:23] of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind
[13:26] meekness long-suffering forbearing one
[13:30] another and forgiving one another If any
[13:32] man have a quarrel against any even as
[13:35] Christ forgave you so also do ye and
[13:39] above all these things put on charity
[13:41] which is the bond of perfectness
[13:43] and let the peace of God rule in your
[13:46] hearts to the which also ye are called
[13:49] in one body and be thankful let the word
[13:52] of Christ dwell in you richly in all
[13:55] wisdom teaching and admonishing one
[13:57] another in Psalms and hymns and
[14:00] spiritual songs singing with Grace in
[14:02] your hearts to the Lord and whatsoever
[14:04] you do in word or deed do all in the
[14:07] name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to
[14:10] God in the father by him verse 23 says
[14:14] and whatsoever you do do it hardly as
[14:17] unto the Lord and not unto men knowing
[14:20] that of the Lord ye shall receive the
[14:22] reward of the inheritance for you serve
[14:25] the Lord Christ for he that doeth wrong
[14:27] shall receive for the wrong which he
[14:29] hath done and there is no respect of
[14:31] persons also in Jude chapter 1
[14:35] I'm going to read
[14:39] beginning of verse number 20.
[14:41] but ye beloved building up yourselves on
[14:45] your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy
[14:47] Ghost
[14:48] keep yourselves in the love of God
[14:51] looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
[14:54] Christ unto eternal life
[14:56] and of some have compassion making a
[15:00] difference and others save with fear
[15:02] pulling them out of the fire hating even
[15:05] the Garment spotted by the flesh now
[15:08] unto him that is able to keep you from
[15:11] falling and to present you faultless
[15:14] before the the presence of his glory
[15:16] with exceeding Joy to the only wise God
[15:19] our savior be glory and Majesty dominion
[15:23] and power both now and ever amen may the
[15:27] Lord bless the reading of his word as
[15:28] you're seated
[15:29] I want to just
[15:32] take a simple thought tonight real basic
[15:36] message but three kinds of Christians
[15:38] and the first uh kind of Christian I'm
[15:42] going to describe to you is is what I
[15:44] would call a casual Christian or a
[15:46] laodicean Christian you know the the
[15:49] thing about the laodicean age it was it
[15:52] was defined as a lukewarm age neither
[15:55] hot nor cold and I find it seems like
[15:58] there's a spirit that is prevalent in
[16:01] the world today that says you know you
[16:04] just need to blend in
[16:06] you know you just don't don't be on the
[16:09] extreme you know just uh if you've got a
[16:12] conviction if you've got something you
[16:13] know just kind of keep that to yourself
[16:15] and don't rock the boat don't make any
[16:18] waves you know and so that uh that
[16:22] prevailing spirit in the world tends to
[16:25] want to creep into the Christian church
[16:27] as well
[16:28] you know I know we uh some years ago we
[16:31] lived on a a nice property we did not
[16:34] own it but it was about 60 or so acres
[16:38] of land and we had a little portion of
[16:40] that with our mobile home on it I'd get
[16:42] out there and mow the grass and all
[16:44] around that property was was Woods or
[16:46] little forest and pond and all these
[16:49] nice things but I brother Bob I noticed
[16:51] every time I mowed the grass I had to go
[16:54] over a few inches and push back the
[16:57] weeds and the Briars and all the other
[17:01] things that every day was trying to
[17:04] creep into that lawn and take that lawn
[17:07] away from me and I think that is how we
[17:10] have to do as Christians you know we
[17:12] have to always be on the offensive
[17:14] otherwise the devil's just going to
[17:16] crowd in day by day little by little and
[17:20] he's going to push us into a corner
[17:21] where we don't have anything amen and
[17:24] he's overtaken what is rightfully ours
[17:27] and so we we have to be conscious of how
[17:30] the devil works and then we have to be
[17:32] willing to stand out to be set apart
[17:35] amen and and I'll tell you this that's
[17:38] really what the world is longing for and
[17:41] looking for when you go to school or
[17:43] you're at work and you're out in the
[17:45] world you know you think well you know I
[17:47] just need to keep this to myself I don't
[17:48] I don't need to be so different or so
[17:51] stand out so much but I want to tell you
[17:53] your your friends at school you know
[17:56] they would love to have parents that
[17:59] love them as much as your parents love
[18:01] you
[18:03] your parents have curfews they have
[18:05] expectations they love you and they want
[18:08] to protect you and keep you from the
[18:10] harms of the world and your friends at
[18:12] school make may make fun of you because
[18:15] of how strict and how disciplined and
[18:17] all those things you are but the truth
[18:18] of the matter is inside they would love
[18:22] to have parents that thought enough of
[18:24] them and cared enough for them to want
[18:27] to shelter them from the things of the
[18:29] world so you know they they may make fun
[18:31] of you and poke fun of you and make you
[18:33] feel despised or belittle but really
[18:36] what what they're looking for is to have
[18:39] that same thing in their lives so if you
[18:42] can be unashamed and unafraid to share
[18:44] your testimony and let your light shine
[18:47] before them it's you know you're going
[18:49] to stand apart from their other worldly
[18:51] friends who are just like them and
[18:53] they're going to come to you one day and
[18:55] they're going to want to know what this
[18:57] reality is that makes you glit makes you
[18:59] glow instead of glitter they're going to
[19:02] know there's something about you that
[19:04] has a power that has a Radiance that has
[19:06] a warmth but you've got to be willing to
[19:09] let that shine through you or otherwise
[19:12] you know the devil he can't destroy you
[19:14] your Gods you're God's Property but what
[19:17] he can do is marginalize you he can try
[19:20] to make you you know just compress into
[19:22] his little box and silence your voice
[19:24] and and and and and mute you as a
[19:28] Christian amen but the holy spirit is
[19:30] here to give us a voice to give us
[19:33] Liberty Amen to make us comfortable in
[19:36] who we are as Sons and Daughters of God
[19:38] but the prophet of God says this in the
[19:40] breach he said woman just called up
[19:42] another woman said you know I'm
[19:44] Episcopalian said I spoke in tongues the
[19:46] other day I believe I received the Holy
[19:49] Ghost but
[19:50] shh don't tell nobody
[19:53] the prophet of God said I doubt that
[19:54] very much you might have spoke on in
[19:57] tongues but you said A Man on Fire how
[20:01] is he going to set steel amen that's
[20:03] right you can't do it can you imagine
[20:05] Peter James and John and them in the
[20:07] upper room saying oh we got the Holy
[20:09] Ghost now and maybe we better just keep
[20:11] still brother through windows and doors
[20:14] and everything they went out into the
[20:16] street acting like a bunch of drunks
[20:19] that's the real Holy Ghost
[20:22] amen and I tell you what you know years
[20:25] ago I heard a brother and he said you
[20:27] know the Holy Ghost doesn't come the way
[20:29] it used to
[20:30] we don't receive the Holy Ghost the way
[20:32] they did on the day of Pentecost in the
[20:34] book of Acts and I thought brother if
[20:36] you ever get the Holy Ghost I got
[20:38] you know it comes the same way and it
[20:41] does the same things every same way and
[20:45] it does the same things
[20:47] everybody might not speak in tongues
[20:49] everybody might not shout or dance in
[20:52] the spirit but when the power of God
[20:54] grips your life you and everybody around
[20:56] you has got to know you gotta hold us
[20:59] something and something got a hold of
[21:01] you and it's Jesus Christ Living himself
[21:05] amen it's not you acting it's not you
[21:08] replicating it's not you trying to
[21:09] imitate something it's the very life of
[21:12] God channeled through you amen as an
[21:15] expression of his life amen and it's a
[21:17] it's a life-changing power
[21:20] but you know the the Casual Christian
[21:22] doesn't want to make a scene
[21:26] doesn't stand out he just tries to blend
[21:29] in with the crowd you know and I'm not
[21:31] picking on anybody I I don't know most
[21:33] of you but you know and and I was young
[21:36] once too and I had young friends and
[21:38] Believers and you know they'd they'd be
[21:40] out in public somewhere
[21:42] and they'd pray and you know instead of
[21:44] just bowing their heads and really
[21:46] praying where everybody knew they was
[21:47] praying they just kind of closed their
[21:48] eyes and wipe their brow like their eye
[21:50] was itching
[21:52] yeah see you need some more courage
[21:56] you need to be bold in your faith now me
[22:00] on the other hand and again I'm not
[22:02] exalting myself but I would go I
[22:04] remember one time when I was about 16 or
[22:06] 17 I was just getting old enough to go
[22:09] out and and and uh fellowship or
[22:12] congregate with some of the young people
[22:13] and of all places we went to a rockola
[22:16] cafe
[22:18] y'all know what a rock Ola or some of
[22:20] you and and if if you don't know great
[22:22] and if you do know you don't have to
[22:23] pretend like you don't but
[22:26] but we were we were here to rockholder
[22:29] brother said and of all things I asked
[22:31] him to turn the music down
[22:33] because you know we was trying to
[22:34] fellowship and they a rock hole is based
[22:37] around rock and roll music so they're
[22:39] blaring and and one young sister said my
[22:42] amen the god to go into a rock only and
[22:45] ask him to turn the music down but you
[22:47] know I it's just who I was I was like
[22:49] well their music's really loud I can't
[22:51] hear I can't enjoy the fellowship amen
[22:53] but it's okay to stand up for what you
[22:56] believe it's okay to speak out amen it's
[22:58] okay to be different amen because you
[23:01] are different we are pilgrims and
[23:03] strangers sojourning here in this world
[23:05] even when Israel was was leaving Egypt
[23:09] and on their way through all of those
[23:10] lands and those peoples they passed
[23:12] through amen I I just say like this God
[23:15] told him you are passing through on your
[23:18] way too none of those places are your
[23:21] destination none of those peoples are
[23:23] yours amen you're just journeying
[23:25] through that on your way to somewhere
[23:27] where you belong so it's okay to stand
[23:30] out it's okay to be differentiated
[23:32] because you you came from a different
[23:34] place and you're going to a different
[23:36] place
[23:37] I've said this you can all you can go
[23:39] through an airport and you can tell a
[23:41] lot about where people come from or
[23:43] where they're going by the way they're
[23:44] dressed
[23:46] and there's a reason we dress different
[23:48] there's a reason we act different
[23:50] there's a reason we are different
[23:52] because we come from somewhere and we go
[23:55] in somewhere and the way we act and look
[23:58] amen says something about where we came
[24:01] from and where we're going
[24:04] amen amen
[24:07] I'm in the heating and air conditioning
[24:09] business
[24:10] just recently I moved back into the
[24:12] sales world but you know you you use
[24:14] natural types to represent spiritual
[24:16] things and I say this God has not called
[24:19] us to be thermometers
[24:23] thermometers only react
[24:26] to what's going around them
[24:28] and tell you what the temperature is
[24:31] God has not called us to be thermometers
[24:34] God has called us to be thermostats
[24:43] amen
[24:44] because of thermostat
[24:46] knows what the temperature is but it's
[24:50] connected to a source of energy that has
[24:52] the power to make a difference
[24:55] amen so you can put a thermometer Amen
[24:58] in a cold room and it just gets cold but
[25:00] if you put a thermostat in the cold room
[25:02] it's connected to a source of heat and
[25:05] it detects what's going on and says we
[25:07] need to make a change
[25:08] about what's going on right here and we
[25:12] need to channel this power Amen to warm
[25:14] the atmosphere and a true Christian a
[25:17] man can walk into a heated situation and
[25:20] cool it down amen you can take control
[25:22] because you are connected to an
[25:25] omnipotent Force Hallelujah and you are
[25:28] the connection between that atmosphere
[25:30] and a Heavenly atmosphere oh I feel like
[25:34] preaching now you can come into a cold
[25:36] church service and say it sounds like
[25:38] things need to warm up a little bit
[25:40] around here I'm going to clap my hands
[25:42] I'm going to lift my voice amen I'm
[25:44] going to praise my God and I'm going to
[25:46] warm the room up so God can have his way
[25:50] amen we're not here to blend in I'm
[25:53] thinking about three Hebrew children
[25:55] amen they got cast into a fiery furnace
[25:58] one day amen they said we're not going
[26:00] to bend we're not going to Bow and as
[26:02] the world found out they wouldn't burn
[26:04] either I mean why because they were
[26:06] connected Amen to the god of the prophet
[26:09] and they said we're not going to bow to
[26:11] an image that some man made of him amen
[26:13] we know the prophet and we know his God
[26:15] and we refuse to Bow and the prophet of
[26:18] God said when those boys enter that
[26:20] fairy furnace wormwood stepped up and
[26:22] said God I'll go Gabriel stepped up and
[26:25] said God I'll go and God said no you
[26:27] won't those boys didn't stand there for
[26:29] you they stood there on Earth for me and
[26:31] now I'm gonna go stand with them
[26:35] they were unaffected by the fire all the
[26:38] fire did was loose their bands and
[26:41] express God's glory even the king had to
[26:43] testify didn't we throw three in there
[26:45] because one has joined themselves to
[26:48] them and he has the form
[26:50] the fourth man is likened to the son of
[26:53] God
[26:54] Hallelujah
[26:56] I don't want to be a casual Christian
[26:57] tonight
[27:00] second kind of Christian
[27:01] is a costume
[27:04] Christian
[27:05] your home
[27:06] we all know what a costume is
[27:09] some people wear those at Halloween
[27:12] they've been hanging something up in the
[27:14] closet all year
[27:15] and they put on on Halloween and they
[27:17] come out looking like a skeleton or come
[27:19] out looking like a former president or
[27:21] some Hollywood star or some movie star
[27:24] you know and they dress up
[27:26] and in appearance they take on another
[27:30] person's identity
[27:33] and you know we think about that and say
[27:37] you know that's that's a satanic holiday
[27:39] really amen but people do the same thing
[27:42] on Sundays and Wednesdays
[27:46] they go into the closet and they pull
[27:48] out the costume of Christianity
[27:51] and they put it on and they drive the
[27:54] church amen and they show up and look
[27:56] and act like a Christian
[27:58] like a message believer oh and there's
[28:01] not a there's not a spot on their
[28:03] garment it's in pristine condition
[28:05] because it's rarely worn
[28:07] amen amen and they appear perfect and
[28:11] spotless and without blemish oh my amen
[28:14] they've never made a mistake in their
[28:16] life but if they make it home amen
[28:19] without cutting somebody off in traffic
[28:21] or doing some ungodly deed amen they put
[28:23] that Christian costume back in the
[28:26] closet and on Monday morning they're
[28:28] just as worldly as their co-workers or
[28:30] their classmates or their unbelieving
[28:32] family amen why because Christianity to
[28:35] them is not a reality it's something
[28:37] they put on to give others a false
[28:40] impression of who they are
[28:43] I don't want to be a costume Christian
[28:47] was a costume Christian
[28:49] he kept a golden wedge and a Babylonian
[28:52] garment stashed away in the closet and I
[28:56] don't know why and I'll probably never
[28:57] get the chance to ask him why but the
[29:00] only thing I can imagine was he had a
[29:02] backup plan
[29:05] just in case the god of Israel ever
[29:08] failed to make good on his promises
[29:11] Aiken could costume himself
[29:14] as a Babylonian
[29:19] and Escape
[29:20] The Tyranny and the death and the
[29:23] persecution or whatever those enemy
[29:26] nations were trying to afflict on Israel
[29:28] Aiken had a backup plan
[29:31] he had a costume that he could put on
[29:35] to be identified as a Babylonian
[29:38] instead of a Christian
[29:39] but you know what his costume religion
[29:42] was costing people their lives
[29:45] right
[29:46] yeah come on
[29:48] his costume Christianity was causing
[29:51] issues in the church
[29:53] and men were losing their lives
[29:56] as a result of this man's hypocrisy
[30:00] until Joshua one day said this ain't
[30:03] right
[30:04] this is something has gone wrong in the
[30:06] camp and the Holy Spirit began to
[30:09] discern and Aiken was exposed
[30:12] as the costume Christian
[30:15] who the god of Israel Jehovah had never
[30:19] become a reality to him
[30:21] and he died
[30:23] as a result of his unbelief
[30:25] I don't want to be a costume Christian
[30:28] this is the deadliest variety of a
[30:32] Christian there is is someone who is
[30:34] putting on a front of Christianity just
[30:38] to impress others
[30:40] Ahab was a costume Christian
[30:43] do you remember Ahab when they were
[30:45] going into battle and I forget to who
[30:48] the other King was I guess it was
[30:49] Jehoshaphat he told Jehoshaphat
[30:52] Jehoshaphat you dress up like the king
[30:55] of Israel
[30:56] and Ahab put on a costume
[31:00] he disguised himself you read about it
[31:02] in First Kings chapter 22 Ahab disguised
[31:06] himself
[31:07] because he was trying to escape
[31:11] the inevitable result of Prophecy
[31:15] that he would die and the dogs would
[31:19] lick his blood
[31:21] so he set up this scheme and he was
[31:24] propping up Jehoshaphat because he knew
[31:27] the enemy was coming against them and as
[31:29] kings they would be a Target
[31:32] so he was going to let Jehoshaphat go
[31:34] out there with all the kingly garments
[31:36] of an Israelite King while Ahab himself
[31:40] would disguise himself but brother and
[31:43] sister you can't hide from prophecy
[31:45] It's Gonna Get You
[31:48] and one of those uh enemy uh archers
[31:51] amen recognize there's Ahab
[31:54] and the arrow of Prophecy smote him
[31:57] between the shoulders and he died in his
[32:00] costume
[32:03] amen
[32:05] prophecy is going to be fulfilled no
[32:09] matter how well the devil tries to
[32:12] disguise himself
[32:14] amen but let me read about yet a third
[32:18] variety of Christians turn with me to
[32:20] Acts chapter 5 verse 17.
[32:32] acts 5 verse 17
[32:35] then the high priest rose up and all
[32:39] that were with him which is the sect of
[32:41] the Sadducees and we're filled with
[32:43] indignation and laid their hands on the
[32:47] apostles and put them in the common
[32:50] prison but the angel of the Lord by
[32:54] Night opened the prison doors and
[32:57] brought them forth and said go stand and
[33:01] speak in the temple to the people all
[33:04] the words of this life and when they
[33:07] heard that they entered into the temple
[33:09] early in the morning and taught but the
[33:11] high priest came and they that were with
[33:13] him and called the council together and
[33:16] all the Senate of the children of Israel
[33:18] and sent to the prison to have them
[33:21] brought
[33:22] but when the officers came and found
[33:24] them not in the prison they returned and
[33:26] told saying the prison truly found we
[33:28] shut with all safety and the keeper
[33:31] standing without before the doors but
[33:33] when we had opened we found no man with
[33:35] it
[33:36] now when the high priest and the captain
[33:38] of the temple and the chief priests
[33:40] heard these things they doubted of them
[33:42] where unto this would grow
[33:45] then came and told them then came one of
[33:47] them and told them saying behold behold
[33:50] the men whom ye put in prison are
[33:53] standing in the temple and teaching the
[33:56] people
[33:58] then with the captain with the officers
[34:00] and brought them without violence for
[34:02] they feared the people
[34:06] lest they should have been stoned and
[34:08] when they had brought them they sent
[34:09] them before the council and the high
[34:10] priest and asked them sing
[34:13] did not we straightly command you that
[34:17] you should not teach in this name
[34:20] and behold ye have filled Jerusalem with
[34:24] your Doctrine and intend to bring this
[34:27] man's blood upon us
[34:30] then Peter and the other Apostles
[34:32] answered and said we're sorry
[34:38] we're going to retract
[34:41] our statements and and issue an apology
[34:44] we'll even put it in the local paper or
[34:47] on the websites
[34:49] uh-uh right the third variety of
[34:53] Christian I'm going to talk to you about
[34:55] is not a casual Christian is not a
[34:59] costume Christian but they are a
[35:01] Contagious Christian
[35:04] they are more contagious than covet
[35:08] or any other virus anything that Satan
[35:12] has ever put on the earth to try to
[35:14] replicate the thing he fears the most
[35:17] is the Contagious Christian
[35:20] then Peter and the other Apostles
[35:22] answered and said we ought to obey God
[35:26] rather than men the god of our fathers
[35:30] raised up Jesus whom you slew and hanged
[35:33] on the tree him hath got exalted with
[35:35] his right hand to be a prince and a
[35:39] savior for to give repentance to Israel
[35:42] and forgiveness of sins and we are his
[35:46] Witnesses of these things and so is also
[35:51] the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to
[35:53] them that obey him
[35:55] when they heard that they were cut to
[35:58] the heart and took counsel to slay them
[36:01] then stood there up one in the Council
[36:04] of Pharisee named gamalia a doctor of
[36:07] the law had in reputation among all the
[36:10] people and commanded to put the apostles
[36:12] forth a little space and said unto them
[36:15] ye men of Israel take heed to yourselves
[36:18] what ye intend to do as touching these
[36:20] men for before these days rose up
[36:23] thudius uh theodist boasting himself to
[36:26] be somebody to whom a number of men
[36:28] about 400 joined themselves who were
[36:30] slain and all as many uh as obeyed him
[36:34] or scattered and brought to naught and
[36:37] after this man rose up Judas of Galilee
[36:39] in the days of the taxing and Drew away
[36:41] much people after him he also perished
[36:44] and all even as many obeyed as obeyed
[36:46] him were dispersed and now I say unto
[36:49] you refrain from these men
[36:52] these are contagious
[36:54] Christians refrain from these men and
[36:58] let them alone
[36:59] four if this counsel or this working be
[37:03] of men it will come to naught
[37:06] but if it be of God
[37:08] ye cannot
[37:11] overthrow it
[37:13] less happily ye be found even to fight
[37:17] against God
[37:20] I had a neighbor lady one time when I
[37:22] growing up
[37:24] she had a little fire
[37:27] just over it uh she they lived in a
[37:30] little brick home with a nice yard and
[37:32] some
[37:33] I think they had some black walnut or
[37:36] pecan trees out in front of it then
[37:37] there was a driveway and then there was
[37:39] a broom Sage field so she went right
[37:41] across the driveway just over the edge
[37:42] of that broom stage field and she was
[37:44] just burning some some trash some paper
[37:46] there
[37:48] and a wind came up
[37:50] a wind came up and the next thing you
[37:52] know that fire just began to spread
[37:54] beyond the boundaries
[37:57] of what she had intended for that fire
[38:00] to be
[38:01] and Little Miss Willie Nelson I believe
[38:04] was her name a little Miss Nelson was
[38:06] standing out there and uh had a little
[38:09] stick in her hand and you know she stood
[38:11] there and she tried to stomp that fire
[38:14] out
[38:16] which if any of you have ever
[38:18] experienced this understand trying to
[38:20] stomp that fire out is the single worst
[38:23] thing you can do
[38:24] because all she did every time she
[38:28] stomped was spread those Sparks a little
[38:30] farther
[38:32] every time she stepped and every time
[38:35] she stomped she just spread the fire a
[38:37] little further next thing you know she
[38:40] realized she had something on her hands
[38:42] that she could not contain and by the
[38:45] time she got the phone picked up and the
[38:47] fire department which was hardly a mile
[38:49] down the road the whole field was on
[38:52] fire and was threatening to set the next
[38:54] set of trees the next set of woods on
[38:56] fire I want to say that's what happened
[38:58] on the day of Pentecost every time the
[39:01] devil tried to stamp him out he just
[39:04] spread the fire a little farther amen Ed
[39:07] you would think the dumb devil would
[39:08] eventually learn everything he does to
[39:10] attack the move of God only spreads the
[39:12] move of God but when you become a
[39:15] Contagious Christian amen everything
[39:18] that Satan does to try to silence you
[39:20] only spreads The Voice a little bit
[39:23] farther amen so I say stand up speak up
[39:26] amen don't be ashamed to let God use you
[39:30] and to let your life life be the very
[39:32] expression of his
[39:34] in this world today
[39:36] amen being a Contagious Christian in the
[39:40] patna's vision brother Benham is talking
[39:42] about the vision that John saw of the
[39:44] seven golden lampstands with Christ in
[39:46] the midst and he said he turned he said
[39:49] what is the Candlestick it's a lap stand
[39:51] I'm paraphrasing some of this just to
[39:53] get the essence notice how beautiful
[39:55] when he turned he saw this one like the
[39:58] son of man here standing in the midst
[40:02] see he saw in those lap stands the same
[40:05] one that the Babylonian King saw in the
[40:07] midst of the fire furnace God was right
[40:10] there Amen in the midst of his church
[40:12] amen just like he told Saul
[40:15] why persecute us thou me
[40:17] he was in the midst of that group that
[40:19] Saul was trying to step out and all Saul
[40:22] was doing was spreading the effect of it
[40:24] to the extent where he became a part of
[40:26] it if you can't beat him join him right
[40:29] amen
[40:31] oh my one like the son of man standing
[40:33] here in the midst of the seven golden
[40:35] lampstands which means seven Church ages
[40:38] to come each Piper lamp stand hooked
[40:40] into the big main oil sensor this all
[40:43] came up forth through a little
[40:44] odd-shaped lamp that set with the wick
[40:46] in it and the wick hung down into the
[40:48] oil and they poured all into the top of
[40:51] the stand which filled up the big main
[40:52] stem and the big branch and it run off
[40:55] the stems like this and the lamp with
[40:57] the wick hanging down this pipe kept
[41:01] burning day and night
[41:03] you never had to light it it never went
[41:06] out and they just kept pouring oil in
[41:08] the main pipe these lamp stands that
[41:10] come out like this had the laps sitting
[41:12] on top of them the wick from the lamp
[41:14] run down got its life got its life out
[41:18] of here
[41:20] oh what difference it is from a candle
[41:23] it's a lamp stand so your candle's just
[41:26] made of wax and once it burns down
[41:27] that's it
[41:28] but a lab stand is a wick dipped in an
[41:31] Ever renewing supply of all
[41:34] so it just keeps on burning keeps on
[41:38] giving light because one keeps refilling
[41:41] the source that is creating the light
[41:43] now these lamp stands the fire that was
[41:46] on these lamps heads in the Old
[41:47] Testament when they lit one lamp
[41:50] they could not light the next lap with
[41:53] the same fire they had in their hand
[41:55] they lit one lap then picked it up and
[41:59] lit the other lamp
[42:01] and then set it down and lit this lap
[42:03] and took light and lit this lamp with
[42:06] the same fire they had at the beginning
[42:10] oh I hope it don't go over your head
[42:12] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[42:16] and forever the same fire the Holy Ghost
[42:19] lit every one of those churches right
[42:22] down Through the Ages
[42:24] these lamp stands all fit into one great
[42:25] big bowl one great big holder and seven
[42:28] different lamp holders come out of it
[42:29] and when they did each one of those
[42:31] lights was drawing from the main
[42:33] resource of its life
[42:36] and its light was because it had its
[42:38] candle dipped into this main Barrel Oh
[42:41] what a beautiful picture of those Seven
[42:42] Stars it represented that with his life
[42:45] on fire with the Holy Ghost here by
[42:48] faith he's a burning with the Holy Ghost
[42:51] and his life is a candlelord not a
[42:54] candle but a wick that's dipped into the
[42:56] Holy Spirit into Christ and through that
[42:58] Wick he's drawing the life of God out to
[43:03] give light to his church oh what a
[43:07] picture of the True Believer
[43:09] see he's not just putting the emphasis
[43:11] on the messenger he's saying this
[43:13] typifies the believer
[43:16] what kind of a light he's giving the
[43:19] same kind of light that was when the
[43:22] first candle was lit let me just move
[43:24] down for a sake of time notice they are
[43:27] drawing from this main barrel of oil
[43:30] the life is dipped into Christ
[43:33] you are dead and your life is hid in
[43:37] Christ or hidden God through Christ and
[43:40] sealed by the Holy Spirit there's no way
[43:43] at all to ever get you away from here
[43:45] how can you do it nobody can tamper with
[43:48] you the end of your life is burning with
[43:52] the Holy Ghost burning giving light
[43:54] where's the other end of your life
[43:56] dipped into Christ you are dead and
[43:59] hidden in Christ the Holy Ghost is
[44:01] blocking it off there that the devil
[44:03] can't touch you
[44:06] the devil can't touch you
[44:09] he can whiz and make a noise even death
[44:11] itself can't touch you amen
[44:15] I'm I am I won't be too much longer let
[44:18] me read First Peter chapter three
[44:24] First Peter chapter 3
[44:29] you know sometimes we think
[44:32] they're real Christians the ones really
[44:34] setting the fields on fire are the the
[44:37] pastors and the evangelists and the
[44:39] missionaries and you know they go out
[44:41] and they take the gospel and the reports
[44:43] come in and souls are added to the
[44:46] church but but but
[44:48] that should be contrasted with the
[44:52] individual
[44:54] the individual never underestimate
[44:58] God's power to use you
[45:02] as a witness
[45:05] amen when Naaman was healed of leprosy
[45:09] it was the result of one little girl's
[45:11] testimony
[45:14] one little girl said there's a prophet
[45:18] there's a prophet
[45:20] and
[45:21] you he can be healed you you can be
[45:24] healed one little girl's testimony
[45:26] transformed amen a man of great esteem
[45:29] in Syria at the time so here amen I just
[45:33] want you to say I want you to understand
[45:34] don't underestimate your Witness
[45:37] the the the the the power of God to use
[45:41] you Amen to turn uh turn the world
[45:44] upside down I mean turn your family turn
[45:47] your community turn your school turn
[45:49] your workplace if you can be a yielded
[45:51] vessel God can use you right here right
[45:55] now amen to turn Satan's kingdom on its
[45:58] head
[45:58] he says here in First Peter chapter
[46:01] three likewise ye wives be in subjection
[46:04] to your own husbands
[46:06] you know it's awful to see a wife who
[46:08] listens to everybody else's husband but
[46:10] her own
[46:13] or see a man who's interested in
[46:15] everybody else's Affairs but his own
[46:19] but I'm sorry that was free but he says
[46:22] likewise you why it's being subjection
[46:25] to your own husbands that if any obey
[46:28] not the word they also May without the
[46:32] word be one by the conversation of the
[46:37] wives
[46:39] um
[46:39] this word conversation is dealing with
[46:42] your conduct your manner of life
[46:45] even when you say nothing
[46:48] your life is speaking things that are
[46:51] having a compelling effect Amen on that
[46:55] husband or wife that's an unbeliever
[46:57] amen yet the Life of Christ through you
[46:59] amen is is reaching out to bring that
[47:03] companion into Christ
[47:06] while they behold your chaste
[47:09] conversation coupled with fear who's
[47:12] adorning let it not be that outward
[47:14] adorning of plating the hair and wearing
[47:16] of gold see that's a costume Christian
[47:20] they look the part
[47:23] they made great televangelists
[47:28] but the world sees that veneer and says
[47:30] if that's Christianity I want nothing to
[47:32] do with it
[47:34] but what wins The Sinner is the reality
[47:38] of Christ's life lived through you and
[47:41] they say that's different than anything
[47:43] I've ever seen on television I want to
[47:46] know where you got that and where I can
[47:49] receive it
[47:50] whose adorning let it not be of the
[47:52] outward adorning of plating of the hair
[47:54] of wearing of gold or putting on of
[47:56] apparel but let it be the hidden man of
[48:00] the heart in that which is not
[48:02] corruptable even the ornament of a Meek
[48:05] and quiet Spirit which is in the sight
[48:07] of God of great price
[48:10] for after this matter in the old time
[48:12] the holy women also who trusted in God
[48:15] adorned themselves being in subjection
[48:17] unto their own husbands amen your
[48:21] brother told the story about the the
[48:23] sister whose husband would go out and
[48:26] Corrals and hang out with his buddies at
[48:28] the bar and the conversation came up one
[48:30] night said there's no real Christians
[48:33] anymore in the world

[48:45] he gathered his buddies up they left the
[48:46] bar went to the man's home and you know
[48:49] crashed in through the door there making

[48:54] that she get up and make them some bacon
[48:57] and eggs and threw it on the floor you
[48:59] know the story
[49:00] yeah and instead of the woman reviling
[49:03] in Anger putting the man in this place
[49:05] for his friends she just went back to
[49:07] the stove
[49:10] broke some new eggs in the pan must
[49:13] Jesus bear
[49:15] the cross alone
[49:18] and all the world go free

[49:28] for everyone
[49:31] and theirs a cross for me
[49:37] she was just living that life
[49:40] she wasn't trying to conquer she wasn't
[49:43] trying to compel she was just letting
[49:46] her little light shine and her life her
[49:50] witness for Christ amen brought
[49:52] conviction down into that cabin amen and
[49:55] that man and his buddies saw a real
[49:58] Christian in action brother and sister
[50:00] that's a Contagious Christian
[50:03] amen that's the kind of Christianity
[50:07] amen it's contagious it spreads like
[50:11] fire from one to another it makes others
[50:14] want what you have found
[50:17] amen Paul and Silas were contagious
[50:21] Christians
[50:22] they threw him in prison one night and
[50:25] instead of them sitting in the corner of
[50:27] that cell feeling sorry for themselves
[50:28] they began singing praises to the Lord
[50:32] I'm one of them I'm one of them Jesus
[50:36] said count it all joy
[50:39] amen they weren't putting something on
[50:41] hoping God would react they were just
[50:44] doing what they always did they were
[50:47] praising God and brother it made God so
[50:50] pleased amen that he began tapping his
[50:52] foot and like brother Branham said
[50:54] Heaven is his throne and Earth Is His
[50:57] footstool by the body and when God began
[50:59] patting his foot I believe he told the
[51:00] Angels hey amen take it down a few
[51:03] notches I'm getting a higher Praise You
[51:06] Angels don't know how to worship me like
[51:08] this but those on Earth who are the
[51:11] redeemed Sons and Daughters of God who
[51:13] were bought out of Satan's pawn shop
[51:15] amen and redeemed and filled with my
[51:17] spirit when they begin to worship me it
[51:20] gets my attention amen it brings a
[51:22] reaction they compelled God hallelujah
[51:25] and begins tapping his foot and when it
[51:27] begins tapping his foot the Earth began
[51:29] to shake the Earth began to tremble the
[51:32] walls of a prison that was designed to
[51:35] Captivate Christians amen shook to the
[51:39] ground
[51:40] Hallelujah God came on the scene to
[51:43] vindicate the testimony of his sons
[51:46] brother they stood there they weren't
[51:48] looking for a release but God gave him a
[51:51] release and God didn't just shake the
[51:53] walls of the prison down he didn't just
[51:55] break the bars but if Philippian Jailer
[51:57] said what must I do to be saved I want
[52:00] the god that you serve amen I served a
[52:04] god of bondage long enough I want a God
[52:06] that gives Liberty I want to tell you if
