and we just we just ask this blessing upon these knees in your name amen you can be seated um I sure appreciate the brothers and sisters in the back for getting oh all this in working order I think I think it helps to have it on the screen a little bit so so we made it uh we we made it through Hebrews chapter seven and we're on Hebrews chapter 8 which just kind of continues that same thought but we'll want to kind of Jump Ahead like what we've been doing to kind of set the theme of what we're talking about that that where Paul says the law having a shadow of good things to come the law and that Old Testament law all those things that you see you read about in the Old Testament were a shadow of the coming of the eternal life that God could put his life into the heart of the believer and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect but now we've got something that can make us perfect that can change our life change our way of thinking change everything about us so just to kind of summarize some of those things that we talked about last time that a shadow many things that were shattered in the Old Testament Joni and the Jonah and the belly of the well the bronze serpent the Mana that fell in the wilderness the rock of the Israelites drank from the Tabernacle in the wilderness all all these things were a shadow of Christ coming and dying for us that a shadow of Jesus Christ the first Adam compared to the second Adam the Passover Lamb the Cities of Refuge the temple veil torn compared to Jesus's body Isaac the promised son and on and on I mean you could list out uh probably take take a whole day to just list out all the the types and shadows in the Old Testament that were that were speaking of the coming of Christ so it's a shadow of good things to come the law the law shows what God demanded and Calvary shows what God provided to meet that demand so you know we kind of set set the in your thinking the last time we were speaking of it what if you could just take all of those take those Ten Commandments that Moses brought down from the from the uh from the mountain and and if you could put those into the believer's heart so now it wasn't something that you can read off a page and and say well I got to do this and I got to do that but put it into a believer's heart whether it could just be lived um if you know the the Torah is is a the Jews call it the Taurus it's a list of all the 613 Commandments if you go reading those I got to reading those the other day and it's um it's really good to just kind of meditate on all of the things that God wants us to do about how to conduct ourselves with one another and how to make good judgments and be uh make good uh decisions about uh you know when something somebody comes to court what's right and wrong and you put all of that put all of those things into a believer's heart so that it just becomes natural that you treat one another right and so that's that's what I'm gonna maybe we'll we'll take a brief uh aside or go on a rabbit Trail this morning and kind of look at what how the law is fulfilled in you oh so in Hebrews chapter 8 Paul begins to speak about he said now the things we have spoken this is the song now see he's going to some sum everything up we've got in high priest who is said on the right hand of the throne in the mat of the Majesty in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man so what's he what's he setting in our mind he's sitting in the Old Testament you can see that Tabernacle that you could walk through that only the high priest could go into the holy of holies and all of the different Furnitures and things that went into it but that was a shadow of something that's real so now we've got access to the real what what is the real that God could come and dwell Into the Heart of the believer in Hebrews 9 chapter 9 he said for Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands so we're not talking about something that just you can touch anymore but now God has entered into the heart of the believer which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us and doesn't doesn't the bible say that you're seated in Heavenly places with Christ if you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're seated in Heavenly places because now you're United with that eternal life so in Exodus chapter 25 it says and the tongue and the tongues that are speaking of the how the temple was made because Paul's he's about to start talking about the pattern in the mountain he said in the tongs thereof and the snuff dishes thereof shall be of pure gold of a talent of pure gold see how he make it with all these vessels and look that thou uh God's instructions to Moses look that thou make them after their pattern which will show thee in the mount what's the pattern that God doesn't want to just dwell in in a a building made with hands or a building Made of Stone but God wants to dwell in your heart he wants to dwell in you so in Hebrews chapter 8 verse 3 says for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices aware of it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer for if he were on Earth he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law who serve unto the example and Shadow of heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle foresee saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern show to thee in the mount so he's he's comparing that the natural things that the Old Testament priest did where they would they would kill animals and and they would offer gifts for the people but now he's taking it over to a spiritual form that this this is Spirit something spiritual is happening what's the spiritual gift is the gift of the Holy Ghost the gift of the Holy Ghost in your life and now this is something spiritual happening in verse 6 he says but now hath he obtained a more excellent Ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better Covenant which was established upon better promises for that first Covenant had been followless there then no place had been sought for the second if that first Covenant was fine then you wouldn't need a you wouldn't need a second Covenant you wouldn't need a a different kind of priesthood an eternal priesthood you wouldn't need you wouldn't need the gift of the Holy Ghost you wouldn't need eternal life if that first Covenant was not lacking for finding fault with him he saith behold the days come saith the Lord when I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah what's that New Covenant that Jeremiah talked about that that God's life that he would he would break just like Melchizedek did he broke bread and and and and and served wine and Jesus was which was a type of Jesus his flesh being torn and his life being poured out so that life could come back into the believer for this is the my blood of the new testament which is shared for many of the remission of sins is what Jesus said there in the upper room so in Jeremiah if we if we go back and read what that that prophecy of that new covenant is he said in Jeremiah verse 31 of chapter 31 behold the days comes that the Lord that I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt which my Covenant they break although I wasn't husband unto them saith the Lord but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with a house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and ride it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my people now that's a covenant now when God can take all of those 613 Commandments all those law all that Torah all the things that God came down off the mountain with and put it into your heart so that you can love your neighbor so now you've got power to forgive somebody when they do something wrong to you because you've got the love of God in your heart that now you're actually fulfilling the essence of what the law is because the law Giver is in your heart and it's not a book of rules but God is living it out in your life when they shall teach no more every man is neighbor and every man is brother saying know the Lord for they shall all know me from the least of them under the greatest of them saith the Lord for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more you think about what a blessing it is that you can turn to your neighbor in church and when you walk out the doors that every holy ghost filled Believers got those Commandments in their heart and got the ability the power of God in their life to live those live those things out to to where the rest of the world can't love their neighbor but you can love your neighbor you can love somebody that smites you on your cheek and spits in your face because that's what the life of God gives you the power of God and the Heart of the believer to fulfill the essence of the Commandment so in verse 8 and of of Hebrews 8 he says for finding fault with him he saith behold the days come saith the Lord when I will make a New Covenant when the house of Israel and and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them uh I I I put this slide in here because I want to compare how Paul Paul what's he doing he's actually quoting what we just read in Jeremiah but I I wanted to kind of call out because you know sometimes people get a little bit critical to say well we're not quoting exactly but look how look how uh Paul he adds so he interpolates a little bit he adds his own little thought into his reading of Jeremiah and this is what I was talking about I was listening to it to a rabbi and he really blasted Paul for doing this and saying he he said all kinds of but you know what Paul's doing is he's bringing forth the essence of what Jeremiah is saying he's he's he's a he's he's elaborate he's putting his own words and things but the essence is the same as he quotes and he says not according to that so and right there in yellows is some of the things that Paul kind of he throws in there as he's quoting Jeremiah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt because they continue not in my Covenant and I regarded them not saith the Lord for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and I'll be to them a God and they should be to be a people and they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother is saying know the Lord For All Shall know me from the least to the greatest for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities well I'll remember no more now if you really study out the way that that the New Testament preachers quote of the Old Testament they do this a lot when they're when they're preaching they'll take a scripture over here in scripture over there and they'll put it together and they'll add they'll add and they'll because what are they doing they're preaching for now they're preaching from a revelation that it's not just something that just like uh they they're understanding the meaning of what is it needs to be communicated so brother Ram said you can't no matter what you do you quit drinking quit smoking quit telling lies go to church and try to do this and try to do that you're still carnal that's just law the law makes nothing perfect but what makes perfect Christ I might quit stealing quit quit lying quit stealing quit committing adultery quit chewing quit all the things and I'm still carnal God don't receive it because I have nothing to offer him in propitiation but the minute that I lay my hands upon the Blessed head of the Lord Jesus and say Lord I'm no good will you take me as your servant and God kisses away my sin I stand perfect and the sign of God that's right I'm not standing on my own Merit I'm standing on his and he has perfected us through his suffering and his blood you think about now I've got this picture of the cross the shadow of the Cross Laying across the scripture all of that that this that the Old Testament required all of that was fulfilled in Christ that when he died on the cross if you're in Christ then then the requirement has been met that the requirement has been satisfied because his blood paid the price for that but now I want to kind of get into something that's a little bit difficult to express is that is that you there is no requirement to come to the Cross but after you come to the cross and you're in him then it changes your life there's a before and after before there's no requirement to come to the Cross but after you come to the cross and get it in it will change your life thank you so Paul in verse 13 He says in this he saith a New Covenant he hath made the first old now that which decadeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away so I got these bullet points here Christ sacrifice met every requirement of the law if you are in Christ every requirement has already been met there's no requirement for you to do anything it's not how much you pray or how much you push a penny with your nose or all you have to do is believe on the Lord Jesus Christ to receive your salvation but the Life of Christ and the believer will become a living manifestation of the essence of the law and it begins to express outward in you so there's no way there's no requirement for you to come to Christ but when you come to Christ you become the the word manifest on two feet now now so so Jesus said in chapter Mark chapter 12 he said and Jesus answered in the first of all the Commandments says Hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord he's he's kind of summing everything up all the Ten Commandments all the law everything the Lord hear our Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment you put the you put the life of God into a Believer and now they can fulfill that because they love God in the way that they should the way that the Old Testament was was laid out and now it's not a commandment anymore now you love God and the second is like namely this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these now after after you're born again now you can love you're fulfilling that that law the law becomes manifest in you so that's why Romans chapter 8 says what for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit you're not walking after the do's and don'ts anymore but you're walking after after a new law a law of love for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God so if you're spiritually minded it becomes subject to the law of God neither in D can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his now also in Romans chapter 13 it says oh no man anything but what to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law you get the eternal life that life of God in you and you're able to express the love of God then you actually are fulfilling the law that's what the Bible says for this Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying it's all summed up in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself see the reason people commit adultery is because they don't love they don't love the the person that they're that they're they're talking to they don't love that girl that they're lusting after they don't I mean I'm I don't mean like love like you want to get married to them but they don't they don't love them and as as part of like wanting to see them saved wanting to want to see their soul want them to see salvation the reason people kill is because they don't love the reason people steal is because they don't love the reason you know you talk about the sometimes the kids will go to camps and stuff and that somebody will steal their iPhone or steal something that was in their pocketbook the reason somebody does that is because they don't love they don't as a person as a Humanity they don't want to see them say they don't want the good for them they they they don't uh you know they don't value them as in their Humanity Thou shalt not bear false witness that's the reason people lies because they don't love thou shalt not covet they can covet to compare you know people say there's that saying that uh comparison is the is the thief of Joy when you covet something somebody else's God then your your joy is actually robbed and the reason that people covet the reason you want the car that the neighbors driving or something that somebody else has is because you don't love that's what I'm talking about that's what the the new birth gives you is love love to be able to love somebody else and when you love the the way that that that Paul is talking about here in Romans you are fulfilling the essence of the law love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law so in Galatians he says for Brethren you have been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law all the law all the essence of the Old Testament law is fulfilled in this new covenant when Christ's life is put into the heart of the believer and you can love the way that God wanted you to from the beginning all the law was fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself you know you know when you really think if you meditate on what that means that when somebody's going through a trial and maybe they slip up and fall you look at them with different eyes because you know I'm a human too and I'm going through stuff and I want somebody to give me Grace and you look at somebody and you because you love them you give them you give them a little more grace you give them you treat them a little bit differently because you realize we're we're all humans we're all trying to get to the same goal if you fulfill the Royal law James said according to the scripture Thou shalt if you fulfill the Royal law Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well you see you see how see how that's difficult to express there's no requirement to come to Christ there's nothing you have to do to work yourself up or something to come to Christ but after you come to Christ after you get in him it's going there's going to be something worked out from your members it's going what's what's put on display love the love of God and first John said hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren but whoso hath this world's good and see if his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in him my little children let us not love and word neither in tongue but in deed and Truth in first John again John so many so much of what he talked about was about based on love because he loved Jesus Christ whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that began loveth him also that has begotten so if you love The Giver you're going to love those that received eternal life so if you love Jesus Christ you can't help but love me and you can't help but love one another because if you love Jesus you can't help but love those that have received him Oh by that should change our our attitudes this morning when you think about you know everybody in this building and maybe streaming it online loves God loves Jesus Christ and if you've received him you can't help but love one another by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous what what Commandments the 613 Commandments in the Old Testament that if you go back and read They're talking about how to be just to one another how to make good decisions they're not Grievous they're they're things that that you know just naturally we should just do to one another and when you've got the eternal life of God living in you it will become natural because as you eat the word you become the word and you you're actually becoming what God wanted you to be love is the fulfilling of the law brother Brown said in the brass serpent he said God has a law and that law is love God can't work against himself then if I love God correctly then I'm going to testify the truth about God if I'm in in love with him I've got a wife here's in the building God knows I love her well you know everything good and everything is going to be for my wife you know that sure just like your husband would be to you well now if we love God then my confidence becomes perfect in him as I love him now he can't break that law of Love see because it's in my heart now you think about on the left there I got what what is Love In First Corinthians 13 will tell you so you know right there at the top of the list of course we know brother Ryan said love is corrective love is corrective because when you're doing wrong level what love will straighten you out but love suffers alone it's a long suffering maybe sometimes you got children out in the world and and you realize what long suffering is because you but you're patient love love love will wait a while because it's love love is kind love is not always putting somebody down and saying well you ain't worth nothing and see I don't I don't like bullying and putting down because love love will lift you up love envious not want us not itself it's not puffed up because look what's love trying to do prefer your brother does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked you can poke somebody with love but they won't slap you back because they love you think of no evil Rejoice at the nodded iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hope is all things endureth all things and never fails love will never fail and that little brother said what love cast out Devils love why because love is the light I'm talking about real love agape love love is the life of God that's Zoe life that life will cast out Devils will you come in come home and your your kids are all running around you know your wife's in a tizzy and and everything that brother Brown said you just come home and you just start straightening things up and and showing a little bit love and and that's I think that's a lesson for all of us uh myself included because love uh a hand slapped up against the face or strong words many times fail but love will always win the day so Paul said in Hebrews chapter 9 . what are we talking about we're talking about the law take that Old Testament law and putting it into the heart of the believer in a New Covenant that that law can be lived out in you then verily the first Covenant had also ordinances of divine service in a worldly Sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick and the table and the showbread which is called the sanctuary he's he's making a point you could see all these things in the natural but now we're talking about something spiritual and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden sensor and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid around about what gold wearing was the golden pot that had Manna and Aaron's raw that bud it in the tables of the Covenant and over at the cherubimes of gold shout on The Mercy Seat of which we cannot now speak particularly all of those things represented something well what do they represent like like brother Louise and brother Wade have been breaking down the rod that budded that all all these things are speaking of the life of God and the believer that now you can eat of that manna that they that they that only the high priest could eat of now now you can you can enter in and eat of that now now you can have that eternal life with that rod budded and and you now those tables of stone are in the believer's heart now all of those things that were just Shadows of now we've got the reality of it in our lives in Hebrews chapter 9. now when these things were thus ordained in verse 6 he said no the priest went always into the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for The Heirs of the people the Holy Ghost is signified it's about the Holy Ghost that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while is the first Tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present in which we were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience if the musicians would go ahead and come forward which stood only in meats and drinks and diverse Washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation we've got something that can change our conscience change our thinking but Christ being coming high priest of good things to come by greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and cows calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us what holy Place into your heart and we'll stop right there God bless you let's meditate on these things as we prepare for the service [Applause]
