telling y'all about that's the sea of forgetfulness that's so much love he can't even remember your sins no more the sinless pride of Jesus Christ we just got to start believing him we just got to start doing the things like our brother said you know the eternal life we got to take hold on it amen make sure you got it they enjoy this morning we sure did and we appreciate all y'all coming and being with us and and we got one more time we'll have brother Samuel come and and uh preach for us and we appreciate him love him with the love of the Lord he's got a nice group down there in Beaufort remember brother Louise will be preaching for us Wednesday night um me and Thomas and June will be leaving tomorrow morning we're going to take off to Illinois until Friday so we'll be back then and then remember next Sunday afternoon questions and answers for the Youth and the singles of the church so just remember that and keep in prayer amen all mine's clear this thing Open the Eyes of My Heart boy that was a good song wasn't it they did they I think you get better every time they sing it so sing it more amen [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] oh Jesus I want to see you to see you high and lift it up foreign [Music] power and love we sing Holy Holy holy holy holy You Are Holy Holy Holy bless your holy holy holy holy I want to see you [Music] amen this afternoon once again in the Lord we're going to go ahead and go directly to the word you already know me my name is we're going to go directly to the word but before we do that let's let's have a word of prayer they would be the one to guide us this afternoon he would speak to our hearts let's pray Heavenly Father we're once again before your presence we ask you father Tom is to take control of us father take take every nervousness anything that would hinder Lord in your hands we commit ourselves come Lord Jesus to our hearts in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask amen amen your Bibles this afternoon through the book of Hebrews El capitulo says Uno chapter 6 verse 1-6 and this afternoon uh continue we're going to continue but our thought is seeking after after Perfection or seeking perfection the scripture in the name of the Lord Jesus Christo Perfection therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from that works and of Faith toward God foreign of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on hand of hands and of resurrection of the dead end of Eternal judgment yes and this we will do if God permit celestial for it's impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost s and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come is if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame foreign Matthew chapter 5 verse 48. said was Perfecto be perfect as your father in Heaven which is in heaven is perfect you may be seated remember we're seeking after perfection as we seek perfection our father he's perfect our heavenly father is perfect and if we're seeking after Perfection or if we're seeing the perfection and we are going to be perfect because nothing of this Earth will come into the kingdom of God sin without said a perfect being perfect Oria so our trajectory here on Earth is our journey here on Earth is towards perfection I'm not perfect and you're not perfect but brother Brandon says that this body is sin how can that be yeah this is flesh and this flesh is rotten it's a little tough to think about because we we bathe we change our clothes maybe we put a little bit of a lotion a little bit of a cologne to smell a little better but even then yes you're still rotting because sin is something ugly something that we really don't want because we don't really want it you get angry and audio you you get upset because you keep walking you're not perfect but when all the things of this Earth this life leave this body Perfection then you will come to Perfection you're walking us you have problems you have struggles you have sicknesses anything will try to trot us down but we're going to a place and that place is perfection we are citizens and I was talking to brother Louise okay I don't worry about the citizenship of this Earth that's not really a big concern to me because the city that I'm going to man that's where I'll find perfection then amen amen says Hebrews chapter 6 part 2. this is okay now we got that this morning how that we are perfected Perfection perfected absolutely spotless and blameless not one sin on us and he asks a question is are you above temptation says never do you sin every day says yes sir but yet we are perfected because we are in him and God could not no more than nothing couldn't be righteous he's already judged Us in him when he judged Christ he judged me he judged you you know he can't judge me again because he took my judgment if I've been redeemed do you notice that's the key right there if you've been reading because you're in him but if you're not in here then who is going to judge you who is going to judge you it's tremendous thing to think about so if we have received the knowledge of the truth who is the truth Jesus Jesus is the truth the Lord amen amen when we have received the knowledge of the truth you can have it as we said this morning had the knowledge of the truth he knew the truth the word was made flesh so he had knowledge he knew who Jesus was he knew that he could raise the dead he knew that he could raise the the world he had knowledge but he didn't have it is one thing to know to look but he doesn't have it when you really have it you will realize that you've been redeemed because he already judged him you in him amen previously Dem Pena he says here uh and I got a ticket to show that I've redeemed my watch from the pawn shop let somebody try to take it back in the pawn shops I've got a ticket I have redeemed it is and if the devil would try to put punishment on me I've got a ticket that shows I have been redeemed yes sir no more judgment s Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me Eterna has eternal life you shall never come to the judge but has passed that's my ticket he gave the promise la Perfection so following or seeking Perfection as my father is perfect so if the father is perfect the children are perfect when are they perfected there's a lovely thing right there when is something perfect emotional commodes we were in the in the pawn shop and amen who takes you out of the pawn shop the one that has money who has the money some of us we fell backers if no one can take us out of the pawn shop gonna die there is just like a saying that I know where are there any Catholics here or were there any Catholics here okay I wasn't a Catholic but my parents were Seventh-Day Adventists and they say that whatever their parents said that's what that's how it is the Catholics believe the same thing if their parents were catholic I'm gonna die okay they're in the pawn shop then we don't have it so easy the scripture teaches he said many are called a few are chosen foreign I believe in jumping but none of that will benefit what will benefit us is that we have been born again and so there is no more judgment for you that's a good thing to think about it so this morning we were talking about this Young Rich ruler is and brother Branham says okay he's the one that died alongside Lazarus now when this young man rejected eternal life I asked you a question this afternoon did he have a good rest of his life or or his life just went to ruins after that he had his granaries he he he set him up and he made him bigger he got richer see yeah and Don says so we're here mirando uh looking all around us how people around us progress in life and there's nothing against that is the problem nothing against rich people know the Bible tells us clearly that how tough is for a rich person to get into the kingdom you don't want to have it and just keep it all to yourself he was self-centered he was he was self-centered uh there was a high category that he was in that he didn't want to get around the ones that wanted to be around Jesus because the followers of Jesus were the were the ones of the low class not even middle class ones over there tell him that's what happened on the day of Pentecost the days that they were there together foreign when they went in within those days that they were in there some of them had to fix their differences and God will not take us if we start fixing our own differences with each other yes sir that is the truth I have to go to him with my heart forgive me I spoke bad about you I expressed myself in a wrong way I ask you to to help me I want to go in to go to the kingdom of God I don't want to stay here clean yes nothing there will be there unless there's Divine love God help us each and every one of us need that little part yes and that little part that we need is humility we need humility in our hearts yes amen Lord Jesus Christ these words will help you this afternoon you're helping me amen there you go bendito is the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the message that we were reading follow me come follow me paragraph 47 Lombre and what we were talking about man is also for the ghost for the woman Ben see because we are talking about human life human Souls just as for men and women and after all these opportunities that the young man had amen see [Applause] he says here that see he become on Easy Street how much money he had explained this he probably partied with splendor explain this do you understand the word splendor yeah it's not he wasn't walking like the way we Hispanics say he wasn't walking with just any any sort of thing he knew how to he knew he had an answer for things he could do it he had a way he could he could he could uh he could uh he could he had a way to make it he wasn't poor mucho right we call it on a place where he didn't have to worry about too much again he came to be a governor a ruler La Biblia the Bible refers to here of the as the Young Rich Young Ruler evemos El Prana and we see at a young age maybe in his teenage just out of school just out of graduation maybe a few weeks before he had all that Hearts could desire what a tremendous thing is no modern Ricky yeah he's a fine kid cuando Lucas I believe when Luke wrote about it Jesus I believe it was Jesus at him inside because he loved him and I was I was looking through the scriptures and it's only in Matthew Marcos and in Mark Lucas and then Luke where they wrote about this and I was looking there is only three places where he talks about this and the Bible says that where there's two or three in minumbre gathered together that's where I'll be and the word of God tells us that in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established amen amen Mateo Matthew uh he he he he came to know those scriptures and when he went to the mountain he might have taken he took he took see when Jesus went up to the mountain he took Peter he took John yeah James why didn't he take the rest of them he only took three have you ever asked why yeah because faith is there was love there is there was hope there as well let every word be established every business dealing God had his three Witnesses up above you know that you probably know better than I do ahora now figures Jesus and so he says that Jesus looked at him and said and loved him Ben there's something about the kid there was a nice personality hooked with this kid who worked with this kid who had taught him the Commandments of God and seeing that he kept him and he did it from his youth up and the boy had an ambition as young as young people as young people as young esposa we want to have a good wife you know what the Bible says a good wife will edify his her house amen but a bad wife will bring it down how many here are married no no no no no no cuantos no oh how many here are not been married do you want a bad wife why not he said bad in Spanish Milo [Applause] is how about you young ladies you want a bad husband neither none of us do no matter but if you were living in the day that this young man was living how many would have wanted to marry him probably all of them why Feria he had a ticket they were gonna go why they were gonna go to Hawaii over there where the rich people live and uh in the desert where they made a city over there where the rich people live over there Las Vegas because we're not of this Kingdom we are of another king where where the moth near the termites nothing goes in there only the children of God contentos happy children of God contentos happy children if you don't have money you don't have a house but if you have the Lord Jesus Christ you're the happiest person on Earth amen and the boy had an ambition he wanted eternal life he said Maestro good Master Okay what could I do to inherit eternal life of all you've got in the world yet the soul is yet the Soul on the inside of you tells you there is something that you need that you haven't got solo just by wealth oh no oh it don't always have to be wealth it could be popularity some pretty girl yes she's got her beauty that she can think of maybe she's very popular in school maybe the boy can get any girl he wants he feels that he's kind of secured that's not security that'll fade just like the flowers just a few turns of sun that's gone then you've got a soul that has to live eternally what was the last plague that they had there death then die physically he didn't die but spiritually and so everything starts with the beginning amen amen he started at the beginning spiritually physical physically yes spiritual and then spiritual three things brothers so what are we gonna do to follow the Perfection seek after Perfection seek Perfection and when you get to that point where you believe that you are really sure God's gonna have to do something with you have you ever have you ever thought about many people leave this earth and and we we're we're sad about it and you ask yourself why why did they have to leave if you know what the plan of God is or if you know about God's plan here on this Earth in the natural life we have a destiny bien Mercado a very marked Destiny When God Says up to here and that's it let's read encontra and we're gonna see foreign where he found himself Lucas Lucas Luke 16. Lucas yes he says Luke 16 verse 19. we're going to see where this young man ended up after rejecting the Lord Jesus there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen yes and fared sumptuously every day so vegan you see Khan explained this sumptuously um and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at the his gate full of sores to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table Yeah moreover the dogs came and licked source Los Angeles and he came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosomes also died and was buried Abraham afar off Anton says and Lazarus in his bosom es and he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue I am tormented in this Flame this is real yes now you paint this picture and I believe as brothers says we all fail but when you fail you make it right that's why we have this message [Applause] to to find out about where we're wrong in our lives now many times he makes us to fear yes and he's the one who uh who who puts it in us to to to to follow many times I've said the devil puts someone in jail come on he puts them in jail but he's not the one who's going to take you out he can't take you out he can't take you out all right now I I tell you if the devil puts you in jail will the devil take you out no El Diablo the devil wants you to just get deeper in that cell that we look like this young man that rejected the truth rejected eternal life he found himself found himself screaming yes now you make an example you take a a glass full of water just put your just barely dip your finger conformist and as you dip it and you take it out you see how the water will drip yeah he didn't have water yes but that's what he desired okay would go there and to refresh his tongue the child of God isn't isn't conformed or isn't satisfied with just get it the Son of God wants more okay he wants more of God this young man he wanted more money more riches the Son of God once more of God so that he can be perfect convinced it's kind of difficult to convince ourselves and uh speaking about our young people how is a young man going to convince the one that he likes giving her the rules from the beginning of what he that wants in his home is that the way he's gonna make her fall in love with him no no but no she's going to say that no forget it I don't want none of this but if the young man he's tender yes chocolates with that that might help let me give you a a word of advice and I was talking to the brother brother Zach okay okay no no no no no papa oh brother Bob okay okay and I was telling the brother and I said look brother el hombre the man and the woman they always listen through here but you know what the serpent is where he went to go talk to Eve but the Son and Daughter of God they have to see with the eye of their heart they have to here with the ear of their heart this is my heart have an ear or see yes does my heart have an eye see yes because you as a Christian I tell you you don't have a bad name no no um oh you don't have a bad man you don't want a bad man in your life or a bad husband but you want a good husband that helps you that takes care of you that does good things for you because what what is it worth it you're in the house yes you play your role as mother as as as as wife and many make the mistake they say well if I get married I'm not going to have to do so much work and they get a man that puts them to work yes because that man he's lazy he doesn't want to work he wants to live in misery because he says he says that the poor shall inherit the kingdom of God but it doesn't work that way no no thank you [Laughter] God help you sisters God help you brother find you a good wife amen amen and the message contending for the faith ful cincuentes give me a few more minutes Brothers I forgot to put my watch on I didn't bring it you want me to tell you a story according to what I thought [Music] because my wife is usually the one who packs our bags and I forgot my watch and my wedding band when we were coming here she asked me where's your water oh Lord will be there I forgot it did you put everything else in there yeah I'm terrible at those things [Laughter] I'm sorry that I found a good wife [Laughter] he's very she takes care of me is us as man we forget a lot but it's not that God gave her to me I I I I I came I stumbled to her the only poor one was was Adam Adam God did give him and he took her out of her Assad but I had to seek a wife so so get ready prepare yourself don't just go by your Naturals because they're they're handsome and they have very straight or she looks very nice no no this eye will fail you yeah his ear will fail you here you listen to all kinds of gossip but okay but right here from here you make a good decision from here you look for a good wife I don't know why I'm talking about but I think someone needs it amen in the message contending for the faith is to know God is to know the person Christ himself and to know him is life not to know your textbook or to know your Creed or to know your catechism that isn't life is it is life eternal yes and that's what we wish to know amen amen foreign we've heard of Dr reedhead the man that came to you

where do all go that that make mistakes where was this young man the great error is that you can make in your life is to reject Christ [Music] he was crying out crying who was he screaming he was talking he was trying to get Abraham's attention they would send Lazarus now the Bible says that there's a Great Divide to me it's come up maybe like a mountain that you you can't cross over please and be alone send him in other words please don't don't be bad in it but he told them Mira he said look in your life you had Goods and Lazarus he suffered now l Gosa he is rejoicing now he's rejoicing
