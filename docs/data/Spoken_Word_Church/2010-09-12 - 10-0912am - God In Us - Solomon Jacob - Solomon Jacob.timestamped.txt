[42:17] so now no more we are under curse but we
[42:20] live under the blessings of the Living
[42:23] God and it's so good to know the Living
[42:25] God Amen
[42:27] till the age of
[42:30] 25 I never I never knew Jesus as my
[42:34] personal savior or my personal Lord I
[42:37] knew him that he is my God and he is the
[42:41] place of worship that I I should go and
[42:44] worship because I was brought up in a
[42:47] family of my father being a Jew and my
[42:49] mother being a Indian Christian and in
[42:53] that atmosphere I was brought up I
[42:56] always had a fear of God in my heart
[42:58] amen and I used to go to church with my
[43:01] mother and at the same time on Sabbat us
[43:05] to have a prayer at home Sabbat prayer
[43:09] with my father and this was the way that
[43:12] I was brought up but never had a real
[43:16] relation with the Lord
[43:18] Jesus but it so happened in my city
[43:22] during 1972 and 73 that there was a
[43:26] great moo of of the holy spirit in my
[43:28] place amen there was no Pentecostal
[43:31] preacher or there was no Pentecostal
[43:33] Mission or nothing kind of that but just
[43:36] the brothers and sisters got together to
[43:38] pray together and the spirit of God just
[43:40] fell upon them and it's so did happen
[43:45] that we saw the many the lives of many
[43:47] people being changed and I saw them I
[43:50] met them they were my friends they were
[43:53] the people who used to go with me to the
[43:55] church and I saw these people being
[43:57] change and that attracted me many times
[44:00] and one day they invited me to come over
[44:03] to the prayer in their house there so I
[44:06] went there and spend a time there and
[44:09] when I nailed down with them in a prayer
[44:12] and I started to pray and all of a
[44:15] sudden then I felt in the spirit of the
[44:16] Lord that something has just come upon
[44:20] me am and I started to confess my sin
[44:23] and I I started to call upon the Lord
[44:25] that Lord forgive me amen
[44:27] and by the blood of your on the cross
[44:30] that you shed for me that you can uh you
[44:34] can remove all these sins from my life
[44:38] and then the Lord just pour on his
[44:40] Spirit upon me and I also started to
[44:43] speak in tongues and praise God and that
[44:45] continued for hours on that night and
[44:48] that was the first experience that I had
[44:51] with the Lord Jesus Christ am and since
[44:54] then I received him as my personal SA
[44:57] Savior and my Lord and it has been so
[45:00] good from that time that my life was
[45:03] changed but that time I was a
[45:06] professional soccer player in India and
[45:08] I used to play for the clubs and the and
[45:10] the teams there in India and that was my
[45:13] life so before this thing could
[45:18] happen in the year
[45:20] 1969 there was a great call from Israel
[45:25] to call all their people back to the
[45:28] land of Israel and they had they had a
[45:32] big war with all the Muslim nations and
[45:37] because they lost many ones in that war
[45:40] the Israel government had sent the call
[45:43] throughout their Jewish agencies around
[45:45] the world that they want their people to
[45:48] come back to Israel so my father he got
[45:52] that news and he decided to move to
[45:56] Israel that was in
[45:59] 1969 so he asked my mother and me also
[46:04] that would you like to go with us so my
[46:06] mother uh she refused on certain things
[46:09] because our education my elder sister
[46:12] was going under education my younger
[46:14] sister was going under education and I
[46:16] was just a professional soccer so I
[46:18] thought that I will come to a certain
[46:20] level higher level in in India and then
[46:23] I will go so I told my father that I
[46:25] will wait for a few more years and then
[46:27] I'll will come to Israel but I my other
[46:30] family we had I had two mothers that
[46:32] step mother and uh from them they had
[46:36] the three brothers and three sisters
[46:37] they were all Jews my another mother
[46:40] that's the sa mother was a Jew so they
[46:42] decided to go to Israel so they left in
[46:47] 1969 and they went to Israel so we we
[46:50] stayed back and that's how I felt the
[46:54] Lord had a plan for me that I come to
[46:57] the Lord in 72 that was 3 years after my
[47:01] father left to Israel and he went there
[47:05] so I was playing for the uh big clubs
[47:08] there in India but Lord as Lord wanted
[47:12] me to get him and to serve him that one
[47:15] day while playing I had an injury on my
[47:18] left knee and uh the all the ligaments
[47:21] in that left knee were damaged and I had
[47:25] to come back home and I was was put in
[47:27] the plaster my and then when I come back
[47:30] home I got back The Fellowship of the
[47:33] Brethren who were were all praying
[47:35] together and I come in there and then I
[47:38] invited them to come my place and I I
[47:41] gave them a room that we all could to
[47:43] come together and pray together and we
[47:45] just started praying praying and praying
[47:47] there so after a week or so it so
[47:51] happened that while we were praying that
[47:54] same day there on that day I felt again
[47:57] the power of God come upon me and I feel
[48:00] that Lord has touched my knee and my
[48:02] knee is healed so I called my elder
[48:05] sister she was a doctor and I told her
[48:08] to open the plaster but she refused and
[48:11] she said no you will have to again go
[48:13] into the plaster I said no I said the
[48:15] Lord has healed me you just open the
[48:18] plaster and she opened the plaster and
[48:20] praise God that my knee was healed and
[48:24] and and just walking and and and after
[48:27] that I prayed I played for a while but
[48:30] that was not the will of the Lord for me
[48:32] to do so in first January 19 uh 73 I
[48:37] dedicated myself in the hands of the
[48:40] Lord for the ministry and that time I
[48:43] was just new I didn't know the Bible I
[48:46] know didn't know the books I didn't know
[48:48] anything of it I didn't know any
[48:50] teachings of any any Mission or
[48:53] denomination or anything I just knew
[48:55] that there are churches and that time we
[48:58] were going to the Christian and
[49:00] Missionary Alliance Church in my place
[49:02] so that was the church there I to go but
[49:06] I never knew the teaching of Trinity or
[49:09] anything but when I started to preach I
[49:12] started to preach that there is only one
[49:14] God Amen I started to preach that how
[49:18] the Lord God has come down and and being
[49:21] in Jesus and revealed to us and has
[49:24] saved us and when I started to preach
[49:27] people started to uh to blame me to call
[49:31] me as Jesus only man yeah I didn't know
[49:35] what was that and that time I it was
[49:38] just new and strange to me but still I
[49:41] continued and then when I started to
[49:43] continue many people left me yeah and I
[49:47] continued to preach the gospel I went
[49:50] lot of places I went in the tribal area
[49:52] I went in the Village area different
[49:54] area and that time I preach in thousands
[49:58] of people and baptize hundreds of them
[50:00] but that time I baptized them in the
[50:02] name of Father Son and the Holy Ghost
[50:04] because I didn't knew uh the more uh
[50:07] things about it but as the people were
[50:10] baptized so I baptized the people then
[50:14] it so happened that during one of the
[50:16] meetings that we had one Pentecostal
[50:18] preacher was there and he handed me over
[50:21] the book the exposition of the seven
[50:24] Church ages and I got that book and he
[50:27] said you like to read this book you read
[50:29] this book because he he of course later
[50:33] on that I came to know that he accepted
[50:35] the message and the prophet but later on
[50:38] he denied it so he gave that book to me
[50:41] and I started reading that book and when
[50:43] I went through few pages and I realized
[50:47] that the the the message that about the
[50:50] godhe which I was preaching was right in
[50:52] this book and it was a confirmation and
[50:55] I thank God for that and I like that
[50:57] book and in so much that I started
[50:59] reading and reading that book and there
[51:01] the Lord revealed to me that the baptism
[51:04] is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:07] so that was that so I got it I tried to
[51:10] speak to the people uh but they don't
[51:12] want to listen because they all believed
[51:14] that the baptism should be in Trinity so
[51:17] when I read that book I got to know
[51:20] through that book the address of
[51:22] Jefferson will so I wrote them back that
[51:24] I wanted to know more about this Prophet
[51:26] about this messenger and his messages
[51:30] and so so they diverted me to brother
[51:33] Charles
[51:34] SAS uh his his church was in Lauren ho
[51:37] oav and his son Randy S I think is's a
[51:41] pastoring the church there now still so
[51:43] he was a missionary down in India that
[51:46] time so I called him and he says Brother
[51:49] come on he says come up so I went to
[51:51] Madras from my place about a night
[51:53] oright Journey from my place I met them
[51:56] him and his wife they were there and I
[51:59] spent about a week with them and we
[52:01] shared a lot of things through the book
[52:03] and through the prophet's messages and
[52:05] he told me many more things and that
[52:07] enlightened me and he gave me the first
[52:11] CD of brother bram's message was to the
[52:14] looking to the Unseen amen and that
[52:17] message I got and I heard that message
[52:19] came back home and it was a great
[52:21] blessing for me and since then I tried
[52:24] to move forward and forward and then
[52:27] this the Revelation which I had got and
[52:30] the Lord has blessed and opened my eyes
[52:32] to receive this Revelation I shared this
[52:36] good Tiding with my brothers and the the
[52:40] brothers which were I used to fellowship
[52:42] with in Bombay so I I told them that
[52:45] brother this is what the Lord has given
[52:47] to me and and you listen and you read it
[52:50] so I played the tape the looking to the
[52:52] Unseen to those brothers and I I showed
[52:54] them the book this exposition of seven
[52:56] Church ages and then we sat together and
[53:00] you know we looked into the scriptures
[53:02] and that's what and then we try to find
[53:05] out that if there are many other
[53:07] brothers of this faith and there we come
[53:09] to know that there are few Brothers in
[53:12] Bombay and then we got in touch with
[53:15] them then the brothers in Bombay were
[53:17] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[53:19] Christ then I was baptized in the name
[53:21] of the Lord Jesus Christ and then I
[53:23] baptized my wife my mother and my sister
[53:25] in the family
[53:27] and this way the Lord started to work in
[53:30] in my place and there was a great
[53:32] blessing I moved in Bombay started to
[53:35] preach and to go among those brothers
[53:37] who already were there but that was the
[53:40] time they were lying low they were not
[53:42] sharing this message to others it was
[53:45] not like like coming out but we went
[53:48] there and the Lord really blessed and
[53:51] now you can see in Bombay that there are
[53:53] many groups come up in there and those
[53:55] preachers those Brothers whom I
[53:57] introduced this message are now
[54:00] preaching uh the word of God and now are
[54:03] pastoring the many churches down there
[54:05] am so that was how the Lord blessed me
[54:08] and brought me to the knowledge of this
[54:10] message and the prophet and we started
[54:12] to minister in India and the Lord used
[54:15] Us in different places and by God's
[54:18] grace we have good uh six uh churches
[54:22] that we that I Minister among the people
[54:24] and go my Ministry actually is is not a
[54:28] pastoral Ministry I don't Pastor a
[54:30] church as as a pastor but we go I go out
[54:35] and we hold meetings in different places
[54:37] and when the people come out from that
[54:39] place we bring them together and we we
[54:44] just make them to come at a certain
[54:46] place or any any brother's house so that
[54:49] they can come and worship together and
[54:51] there that's the church and then we
[54:54] appoint a brother that we could see that
[54:56] Lord is leading him to have that P
[54:59] pastoral uh uh commission so then we lay
[55:02] our hands on that brother and we give
[55:04] him that church and then like that we
[55:07] move in different places we preach and
[55:10] we teach and bring the people to the
[55:12] knowledge of Christ and to this message
[55:15] and we had the Lord had given to me uh a
[55:18] great opportunity to establish lot of
[55:20] churches now those churches now we gave
[55:23] it to the brothers and they are
[55:24] pastoring those churches but at present
[55:26] I'm having six churches that I go around
[55:30] and minister to those brothers that we
[55:32] already have a pastors to minister to
[55:34] them people and I've given um brother d
[55:38] uh a DVD of our uh Clips uh of our
[55:41] ministry in India and it will be a great
[55:44] blessing if you watch those uh Clips you
[55:46] know and that can give you an idea that
[55:49] how the Lord is using Us in India to put
[55:53] forth the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the
[55:56] message of this hour to bring his bride
[55:59] to or to make his bride ready to meet
[56:02] the Lord Jesus Christ amen her
[56:05] bridegroom amen and it was a great
[56:07] blessing for us and the Lord has been a
[56:10] great a very great uh graceful unto us
[56:14] that we could do these things but then
[56:16] we moved forward in the the about in the
[56:21] in the end of' 70s that is 7879 one
[56:25] brother Shiva tiari from an oror
[56:28] Michigan in the message came to us to
[56:31] India and he was from an oror and when
[56:35] he came to India he ministered in the
[56:37] churches and he ministered for us and we
[56:39] took him around in different places and
[56:42] I interpreted for him from English to
[56:44] Indian languages and it was a great
[56:46] blessing and then I shared to him that
[56:49] brother I'm going to visit my father
[56:51] after many many years because when dad
[56:54] left 69 we never had had an opportunity
[56:57] to meet him neither he could come back
[56:59] neither I could go there so now the time
[57:01] was there so I was prepared I was I come
[57:05] to the Lord Jesus Christ I accepted him
[57:08] as my savior and now here I was in the
[57:10] message of the hour so everything was
[57:12] just ready so I told Brother Shiva that
[57:15] ID like to come because if I pay uh my
[57:18] air ticket to Israel on the same payment
[57:21] I can come to States because that time
[57:23] it was uh the one ticket that you can
[57:26] byy and you can go to these two places
[57:29] so he said he said brother okay you I'll
[57:31] make the arrangements so he sponsored me
[57:33] he SP he sent the all the documents for
[57:35] me and by God's great I got the Visa and
[57:39] I had no problem to you know to prove
[57:41] anything they didn't ask me they just
[57:43] asked me what where are you going I said
[57:45] I'm going to attend the church meetings

[58:31] great blessing came to me through a man

[58:38] Tim Humes father he was there in that
[58:41] camp meeting and we got uh to know each
[58:44] other there and he says he says brother

[59:08] and I stayed with him and that was the
[59:10] first American family and the American

[59:41] them all the brothers brother t uh
[59:44] brother team's brother brother Joe Jimmy
[59:47] and Mark and all those and even the
[59:49] sisters I knew them thoroughly I knew

[59:58] and it was a great blessing for me
[1:00:00] brother hes took me around took me
[1:00:02] around many places he took me around
[1:00:04] Jeffersonville and make help me to visit
[1:00:06] all those places and then he had made an
[1:00:09] appointment for me to meet uh Joseph uh
[1:00:12] brandham and it was a great blessing to
[1:00:14] me so that's how that I come to know the
[1:00:19] different brothers and different
[1:00:20] churches and then uh I had a very great
[1:00:23] privilege to be with brother Wilson
[1:00:25] Henry in Atlanta and he was the one of
[1:00:29] the brother that really helped us to
[1:00:31] establish a tap Ministry in India every
[1:00:35] time I come from that that uh 1981 he
[1:00:39] used to give me 50 60 messages of
[1:00:41] brother brandham on tape and I us to
[1:00:44] take back them to India and then on the
[1:00:47] third trip when I was here he bought for
[1:00:51] me a copying machine that cassette to
[1:00:54] cassette and it was a pentagon machine a
[1:00:57] very good you know hard machine and he
[1:01:01] gave it to me and he said brother you
[1:01:03] take this machine back to India I took
[1:01:05] that back to India I had a very hard
[1:01:08] time to get that machine in India
[1:01:10] through the customs and know I had to
[1:01:12] fight for that but they made me to pay
[1:01:15] the Customs heavily on that I said okay
[1:01:18] nothing to be worried it's for the glory
[1:01:20] of the Lord so I brought that machine
[1:01:22] home and we started the tape Ministry in
[1:01:24] India before anyone could start a tape
[1:01:27] Ministry in India by God's grace we
[1:01:30] started we published out a catalog of
[1:01:33] the cassets that I had with me I had
[1:01:36] that library with me and we sent it out
[1:01:38] to the Brethren and we started to
[1:01:40] distribute the messages of brother
[1:01:42] Branham in English and it went for a
[1:01:45] year for five a few years that we
[1:01:48] continued that Ministry but the L on
[1:01:51] that because of the uh lack of finances
[1:01:54] we could not uh do that Ministry forever
[1:01:58] and then we had that machine also uh
[1:02:01] stopped working properly and nobody
[1:02:03] could repair those machine because in
[1:02:04] those days in India it was not so
[1:02:07] Advanced on the things so we had to then
[1:02:10] dump that the whole thing off but by
[1:02:12] God's grace whatever the Lord has given
[1:02:14] us that portion we could I know serve
[1:02:16] the Lord in that manner and preach the
[1:02:18] word and distribute the books and
[1:02:21] distribute the tapes and cassettes so it
[1:02:24] was like that the Lord was leading us to
[1:02:26] certain levels then after I came to USA
[1:02:31] from uh states to from 81 to 87 and 88
[1:02:36] then from there onwards I stopped coming
[1:02:38] to States and I stayed back in India and
[1:02:42] I was doing the ministry in India
[1:02:45] brother Humes came to India twice and
[1:02:47] once he came to us and ministered and he
[1:02:50] couldn't Minister but he was with us and
[1:02:53] there we I met him during that period
[1:02:55] but but the whole family I could meet
[1:02:57] from uh 1981 uh 80 8788 till this this
[1:03:02] day so it was we we were going through
[1:03:04] the ministry and we were been greatly
[1:03:07] blessed in
[1:03:09] 2002 my son I have three sons and one
[1:03:13] daughter so three of my sons they
[1:03:16] decided to move to Israel because I
[1:03:20] don't know what made them to take this
[1:03:22] decision they took this decision without
[1:03:25] asking me when they went and took the
[1:03:27] forms from the Jewish agency then only
[1:03:29] they told me that they they fill the
[1:03:31] forms they were in Bombay my two sons
[1:03:34] also were uh uh professional soccer
[1:03:37] players and they were playing in in the
[1:03:39] city of Bombay that's a big city and you
[1:03:41] know in the big cities they have the big
[1:03:43] teams and they were paid well but they
[1:03:45] decided to move to Israel and they
[1:03:48] filled up the form and my sisters my dad
[1:03:51] was already uh died in
[1:03:53] 1997 so my uh so my other mother was
[1:03:57] also dead so now my sisters were there
[1:03:59] my brothers were there so we send the
[1:04:02] forms in and they certified it and they
[1:04:06] they said yes the these boys are the uh
[1:04:10] sons of our brother and they scrutinized
[1:04:13] the whole thing up and they found that
[1:04:15] that these are the children of the
[1:04:17] Jewish grandfather so according to their
[1:04:20] law of written and uh uh their
[1:04:23] resolution they passed everything
[1:04:25] everything and they allowed my sons to
[1:04:27] come to Israel and the government of
[1:04:31] Israel sent their tickets they sent
[1:04:34] their visa everything was just sent by
[1:04:36] the government of India we didn't have
[1:04:38] to pay any money and everything just
[1:04:41] boys went on 14th of March 2002 to
[1:04:45] Israel that was another move in my
[1:04:48] family the Lord had made it and we
[1:04:51] didn't know that time that why the Lord
[1:04:53] has done this then these boys were there
[1:04:57] they they were sent to the school to
[1:04:59] learn the Hebrew language and they
[1:05:01] learned the Hebrew language well and
[1:05:03] they can now very well speak and and
[1:05:06] write Hindu Hebrew language and they are
[1:05:09] well in that so they were there and they
[1:05:11] were in in the that is called Ulan that
[1:05:15] Hebrew school that they go to and they
[1:05:17] come out of that and they they were in
[1:05:19] the uh regular life but then they will
[1:05:22] call they were called for army training
[1:05:25] because in Israel every boy and a girl
[1:05:29] after the age of 18 has to serve an army
[1:05:32] training and they were called for the
[1:05:34] army
[1:05:35] training two boys younger boys that the
[1:05:39] middle one and the last the boy youngest
[1:05:42] boy they were called for the regular
[1:05:43] army training that was 2 and a half year
[1:05:45] training for them my oldest son as he
[1:05:49] was little above the age and his
[1:05:52] qualification was a little higher as he
[1:05:54] was doing his do doctorate in chemistry
[1:05:56] there so they gave him six-month Army
[1:06:00] but these two boys were in a regular
[1:06:02] army and these boys they come in Israel
[1:06:06] they didn't come as a Jew they come in
[1:06:09] as a Christian and that testimony they
[1:06:12] all always kept with them amen they
[1:06:15] never denied they never claimed but they
[1:06:18] always proved to the people that they
[1:06:21] believed Jesus as the Messiah right that
[1:06:25] their Messiah is yua right and during
[1:06:28] their life and even during their
[1:06:31] training when they were in the army they
[1:06:34] always used to pray because that's how
[1:06:38] we had brought them up and we have given
[1:06:40] that teaching and they have learn in
[1:06:42] their heart that Jesus is their lord and
[1:06:45] that's to whom to pray and they every
[1:06:47] time they pray to him they committed
[1:06:50] their lives into the hands they read the
[1:06:52] Bible in the morning they they pray and
[1:06:55] read the Bible in the in the in the
[1:06:58] dining hall when they go all with along
[1:07:00] the Jewish soldiers around them all the
[1:07:03] Jewish soldiers were there they took the
[1:07:05] bread break pray it break it and then
[1:07:08] eat in the night they pray before they
[1:07:10] go to bed so this prayer life those
[1:07:13] people had seen them and not only those
[1:07:16] but the officers also knew that these
[1:07:19] boys are not Jew but are Christians
[1:07:21] right and that was a great example for
[1:07:24] them amen because hardly Hallelujah I
[1:07:28] mean I mean in a very rare rare to rare
[1:07:31] case there was any Christian man in the
[1:07:34] army of Israel come on very rare I I I
[1:07:37] didn't know that's very rare case and
[1:07:40] that's how they were they looked in but
[1:07:42] in the training God had just blessed
[1:07:45] them amen when they left India I told
[1:07:48] them that sons that you are going to
[1:07:50] Israel I know this is a Strange Land for
[1:07:52] you it's going to be a strange language
[1:07:55] for you
[1:07:55] but God is with you amen and not only
[1:07:58] God is with you but God has blessed you
[1:08:02] twice Hallelujah the people in Israel
[1:08:04] are blessed ones that's a physical
[1:08:07] blessing from Abraham but now you are
[1:08:10] going to Israel with double blessing
[1:08:13] come on that the blessing that's a
[1:08:15] physical blessing and then the second
[1:08:17] blessing to recognize Jesus as the
[1:08:19] Messiah is the Satan that's a spiritual
[1:08:22] blessing the Lord has blessed you and
[1:08:24] God will always make you head and not
[1:08:28] the tail right and they believed on it
[1:08:30] and they took that word and always
[1:08:32] prayed God and during that whole course
[1:08:35] of their training these boys were the
[1:08:39] first among among the all the other
[1:08:42] soldiers my second son he was in the
[1:08:46] paratrooper training and the the
[1:08:49] youngest son Abraham he was on the field
[1:08:53] intelligence that they they that he
[1:08:55] works for the intelligence but not in
[1:08:58] the in the country but on on the war
[1:09:01] zones he works in those areas so he know
[1:09:04] he has to look for the enemy look for
[1:09:06] the spots find out the things from where
[1:09:09] the enemy is coming and and all sort of
[1:09:11] those things so he was put up in that
[1:09:13] and this son the second son was in a
[1:09:17] paratrooper and during his training Lord
[1:09:20] has wonderfully blessed him and Lord not
[1:09:24] only that that but the Lord Has Done
[1:09:26] miracles in his life and shown to the
[1:09:29] people that he was the the believer that
[1:09:33] he believed in Jesus as the Messiah one
[1:09:36] time while having his training he was in
[1:09:40] the plane and they they were to paradrop
[1:09:42] in them and he they had to jump out of
[1:09:45] the plane to have the parachutes
[1:09:47] training and they gave them a spot where
[1:09:50] they should land because they can't go
[1:09:52] anywhere just like because they are they
[1:09:53] are if they are on a mission they are
[1:09:55] given a place that they should land on
[1:09:58] that place and from there they go on the
[1:10:00] mission so they were on the training so
[1:10:02] he jumped out and when he jumped out
[1:10:05] behind him another Soldier jumped out
[1:10:08] and when they jump the both they jumped
[1:10:11] out their parachutes entangled together
[1:10:15] and the those parachute didn't open the
[1:10:18] even their emergency they have another
[1:10:20] parachute that's with tuck with them
[1:10:22] they tried to open that parachute and
[1:10:24] that also didn't work work and they just
[1:10:27] were come down just like just like a
[1:10:29] rock and those officers who were
[1:10:32] watching them through the binoculars and
[1:10:34] they saw these two boys coming down and
[1:10:36] their parachute didn't open so they made
[1:10:38] the siren to and call the ambulance and
[1:10:41] they had their all the Jeeps run to that
[1:10:43] place where they were supposed to land
[1:10:46] and they all all ran to that place and
[1:10:48] these boys were coming down down like a
[1:10:51] rock and these officers thought these
[1:10:54] two boys must have been killed or they
[1:10:56] must have a great injury must have
[1:10:58] broken their bones or heads or anything
[1:11:00] that can happen to them and they went
[1:11:02] they went there they saw these two boys
[1:11:05] standing on their
[1:11:06] feet it was a great
[1:11:09] miracle and really it was a great
[1:11:12] blessing for him and when he come there
[1:11:15] thank you Lord he come there there was
[1:11:17] two the officers come there these two
[1:11:19] boys were standing on their
[1:11:21] feet and they were just shocked to see
[1:11:24] those the boys alive right and the
[1:11:27] officer came and he said I want to tell
[1:11:29] you one thing he said you are saved
[1:11:33] because you pray to God right and that
[1:11:37] God whom you praise has saved you come
[1:11:40] on Amen and not only you but Lord has
[1:11:44] spared the life of the soldier which was
[1:11:47] with you right so that was the testimony
[1:11:49] his officers gave in that time
[1:11:51] Hallelujah so it was a great testimony
[1:11:54] that they could bring about the Messiah
[1:11:57] that whom these people denied but these
[1:12:00] boys received as their Messiah amen and
[1:12:04] then when his training was over and the
[1:12:07] camping ceremony come up my dear friends
[1:12:10] I want to tell you he was aded the best
[1:12:13] soldier of his company Hallelujah he was
[1:12:16] brought before the whole company having
[1:12:18] those commanders standing I was in that
[1:12:20] camping ceremony and I had that great
[1:12:22] opportunity to witness that and the gave
[1:12:25] him that honor Hallelujah and my heart
[1:12:28] was just filled with great joy and
[1:12:29] thanks unto the Lord that Lord see all
[1:12:32] those boys born in Israel brought up in
[1:12:36] Israel and their body structure and
[1:12:39] their everything was different but these
[1:12:41] boys were trained in India for hardship
[1:12:45] right of the life they gone through the
[1:12:47] hardship of their life they were soccer
[1:12:50] player you know good and everything and
[1:12:53] you know
[1:12:55] it's it's so good you know the Lord just
[1:12:57] blessed them amen and when the capping
[1:12:59] ceremony come up I was there and he was
[1:13:03] uh he was waiting he he knew in his
[1:13:06] heart that he was going to be the best
[1:13:08] carot of this whole company oh my and he
[1:13:11] was waiting his name to be called and
[1:13:13] they called from the bottom level you
[1:13:16] know like from this from this you know
[1:13:19] and and he thought that my they did
[1:13:23] something wrong with me because I am a
[1:13:25] Christian yeah yeah you know that
[1:13:27] thought came to his heart he told me
[1:13:29] later on because his name was not
[1:13:31] pronounced and they were calling but
[1:13:33] they were calling from the bottom level
[1:13:35] then to the higher level and then at the
[1:13:38] last they called his name Hallelujah and
[1:13:41] that you know that's he was filled with
[1:13:43] great joy I could see him running down
[1:13:46] from his place where he was standing in
[1:13:48] the Scout you know in the whole that
[1:13:50] company there and he came running and he
[1:13:52] was right before the Commandment
[1:13:54] commandant and and he kept him as the
[1:13:56] best soldier of the company Hallelujah
[1:13:59] so that's how the Lord has blessed these
[1:14:00] boys and it was a great blessing for
[1:14:03] them lord always was with them one time
[1:14:08] as brother said that there were at at
[1:14:11] the Gate of the Israelis and the
[1:14:14] Palestinians yeah and that gate so there
[1:14:18] are soldiers that stand there that those
[1:14:21] uh they allow them the Philistines to
[1:14:23] come in so before that they check them
[1:14:25] and everything you know there is a
[1:14:27] security so one time my son was on the
[1:14:30] duty as a security in those places and
[1:14:33] when he was there on the duty and his
[1:14:35] time was over so he left that place and
[1:14:39] he just walked one or two steps away
[1:14:41] from his place where he was standing and
[1:14:44] uh and guarding that place at gate so
[1:14:46] one girl came in from there a young girl
[1:14:49] came in from the Philistine area and she
[1:14:52] came in and the other boy who took over
[1:14:54] my son was standing there as a God and
[1:14:58] she talked to him and wanted to come in
[1:15:00] so he tried to open the door and while
[1:15:02] he opened the door to check her on the
[1:15:05] same instance she attacked that that
[1:15:07] soldier with with a knife and she
[1:15:10] stabbed him immediately my son rushed
[1:15:13] back and they took the control of that
[1:15:15] girl but that boy was stabbed so that
[1:15:18] would have been my son you know but Lord
[1:15:21] knew and the Lord just brought him out
[1:15:23] from that place in in the in the moment
[1:15:25] of time so these are the things the Lord
[1:15:28] Has Done in the lives of my
[1:15:30] boys but the
[1:15:33] very need that they had in their life
[1:15:37] was not made in there right because
[1:15:40] there they were by themselves they had
[1:15:43] no
[1:15:44] Fellowship they tried to go to The
[1:15:46] Fellowship of the Jewish congregation
[1:15:49] the messic congregation they have in
[1:15:51] Israel so they went there but my my ear
[1:15:56] son was one of the trustees also in that
[1:15:58] Jewish congregation for a long time but
[1:16:02] they felt out of spirit in those places
[1:16:04] right they couldn't match to them right
[1:16:07] and there was something that always they
[1:16:09] failed in their heart that they cannot
[1:16:11] stay here and so they came back and they
[1:16:14] said Dad we no more can go in those
[1:16:16] fellowships because we don't find
[1:16:18] ourself feeding in those people so they
[1:16:21] came out and they they were at home and
[1:16:23] they just started to pray at home and
[1:16:25] that's that's that's that's all then
[1:16:29] they had no Fellowship
[1:16:31] so then we decided that we also should
[1:16:36] move to Israel because in that way we
[1:16:39] can bring the whole family together
[1:16:41] because these three boys were in Israel
[1:16:43] and me my wife and my youngest daughter
[1:16:45] she was in India so we decided to move
[1:16:49] and last year in the month of March my
[1:16:52] daughter she moved to Israel and then in
[1:16:54] the month of September me and my wife
[1:16:57] moved to Israel so everything was paid
[1:17:00] by the government of Israel they took us
[1:17:02] into into the country and the day we
[1:17:04] landed in the country on the airport we
[1:17:06] got our citizenship on the same moment
[1:17:09] we entered there they gave us the
[1:17:11] citizenship and then we had all all the
[1:17:14] rights as a citizen of Israel we have
[1:17:17] the ID cards of Israel we have the
[1:17:19] passport of Israel and everything was
[1:17:21] just blessed so that time I never
[1:17:24] realized that why the Lord has brought
[1:17:25] us together but only the thought was in
[1:17:28] my heart that let's go together as a and
[1:17:31] stay there as a family let there you
[1:17:33] know my Lord had blessed us with our
[1:17:35] with granddaughter so she was already
[1:17:37] staying with her you know and then she
[1:17:40] was staying there as as a tourist not as
[1:17:42] a citizen so she had a problem with
[1:17:45] medical care insurance and everything so
[1:17:49] then we decided let's go there as a
[1:17:52] citizen and we come up there as a
[1:17:54] citizen so now we had all the rights
[1:17:56] there so she lived in there but I lived
[1:17:59] very far for a very few days few months
[1:18:01] in there because I us to go back to
[1:18:03] India and then we come in last September
[1:18:06] and then I went back to India in the
[1:18:08] month of February and from February I
[1:18:11] stayed in India up to June ministering
[1:18:13] the word of God and we had very good
[1:18:16] meetings in those places during this
[1:18:17] last year and few of the meetings are
[1:18:19] there in the clips there you can see and
[1:18:22] by God's grace the Lord opened uh
[1:18:25] denomination Church a Presbyterian
[1:18:27] Church for us to preach in there and we
[1:18:30] had been waiting for last many many
[1:18:33] years I think it's been since 1982 I'm
[1:18:36] holding the meetings in that City and
[1:18:38] Lord just opened this year the the
[1:18:41] hearts and the doors of the denomination
[1:18:43] church and the pastor opened his door
[1:18:46] and we were working on that Pastor from
[1:18:48] a few few years and this time he opened
[1:18:52] the door and we had an opportunity to
[1:18:54] preach the truth right openly without
[1:18:58] keeping anything in our heart we just
[1:19:01] you know just preach to them that where
[1:19:03] they are and what is the true word of
[1:19:05] God and revealed to this this generation
[1:19:08] and we told revealed to them spoke to
[1:19:10] them through the word that all that you
[1:19:12] believe the Trinity and the baptism and
[1:19:15] all other things are from the idol
[1:19:17] worshippers right it's not from the word
[1:19:19] of God but whatever you do is you're
[1:19:22] doing the idol worship the god God is
[1:19:25] the only God there is no two God or no
[1:19:27] three Gods but there is only one God
[1:19:29] that's right and we preach to them and
[1:19:31] they were blessed and they are working
[1:19:34] on those thoughts and those what we
[1:19:36] preach to them and they decided that
[1:19:38] when I go back in the month of December
[1:19:40] they're going to hold 3 days Bible study
[1:19:43] and calling they're going to call all
[1:19:45] other denomination people which are in
[1:19:48] that area to come together and to hear
[1:19:51] the truth hallu so that was the greatest
[1:19:53] opening you'll see in in that DVD that's
[1:19:55] a big church is there with a big cross
[1:19:58] on the church in the inside there all
[1:20:00] the pews and everything that you will
[1:20:02] watch there that's that is the
[1:20:03] Presbyterian Church that the lord gave
[1:20:06] us to preach and we had a wonderful time
[1:20:09] there and while I was there in that time
[1:20:12] that the Lord just put a thought in my
[1:20:14] heart and I was thinking that why I'm am
[1:20:18] there in Israel why my family is there
[1:20:21] in Israel and then the thought the Lord
[1:20:25] just opened my mind and thought that
[1:20:27] lord said that there you are as my
[1:20:30] church as my people you see the people
[1:20:34] who believe the true word of God the
[1:20:37] people who are anointed with that spirit
[1:20:40] that has the true word amen in the past
[1:20:44] days there were people from United
[1:20:46] States that went over to Israel and try
[1:20:50] to do some work come on but they had
[1:20:53] very limited area has to work because
[1:20:55] they didn't have the citizenship they
[1:20:58] have they were there on a tourist visa
[1:21:00] come on and every time they had to go
[1:21:03] and to renew their visas and it was a
[1:21:06] problem for them they worked there in a
[1:21:08] in a p in a private hospital but then
[1:21:11] they had to come back and to leave
[1:21:13] Israel and they couldn't do too much of
[1:21:15] a thing there and there is one family I
[1:21:18] believe still there whom I contacted
[1:21:20] them a long back and I asked them that
[1:21:23] brother my son there and they are
[1:21:25] without Fellowship so I would like to uh
[1:21:28] lead them to you or to any brothers that
[1:21:31] are in the message in Israel right and
[1:21:34] that brother wrote send a replied my
[1:21:37] mail and he said brother he says there
[1:21:39] is no uh message church here in the in
[1:21:41] Israel and there are no not too many uh
[1:21:44] families in here that believe this
[1:21:46] message but we are the one that left
[1:21:48] here and we are too far from your place
[1:21:51] and he says it it will be better for
[1:21:53] your children to to go to a place where
[1:21:56] they worship Jesus Christ as their Lord
[1:21:59] amen I said I said I can't s there are
[1:22:02] the boys already had their uh experience
[1:22:04] with those churches and those people
[1:22:06] right I said no okay I said I didn't
[1:22:08] reply that brother anything I said okay
[1:22:11] so the Lord just put that thought in my
[1:22:14] heart now he says you are as a family
[1:22:17] there and you are there as a citizens of
[1:22:21] Israel right and you are living that
[1:22:23] there with all your rights now you are
[1:22:26] in Israeli you're having all the rights
[1:22:30] and now he says the Lord show that you
[1:22:33] are the
[1:22:34] bride of Christ the church that believes
[1:22:38] the true word amen the true the
[1:22:41] scripture the Revelation the true word
[1:22:44] which has been preached by Paul and laid
[1:22:46] that Foundation right and now here comes
[1:22:48] the prophet and brought us back to that
[1:22:51] Foundation that's right and when we are
[1:22:53] there on that laying on that Foundation
[1:22:55] the Lord opened my eyes and he says look
[1:22:57] there is no church which is laid on that
[1:23:01] true foundation there are Pentecostals
[1:23:04] there are different denominations and
[1:23:06] all of churches are there even the
[1:23:08] messan congregation but they are not
[1:23:11] based on the foundation or on the word
[1:23:13] which is Jesus Christ that's right amen
[1:23:16] they have different preachings different
[1:23:19] teachings but the true church was not
[1:23:22] there and the Lord said that I brought
[1:23:24] you now here because you are the true
[1:23:28] church amen you are the part of that
[1:23:30] body of Christ That was supposed to come
[1:23:33] up in Israel so now we are citizens of
[1:23:36] Israel we have all the rights of Israel
[1:23:38] and the Lord says that as the the gospel
[1:23:43] has come out from Jerusalem and from
[1:23:46] Israel and preach among all the nations
[1:23:48] that has to come back to Israel right
[1:23:51] not to the 1 lak 144,000 mhm
[1:23:55] no that's that's not the bride right
[1:23:58] that's not the bride that's a different
[1:24:01] uh different they are in different age
[1:24:03] they have different preacher different
[1:24:05] Prophet that's not our age but as a
[1:24:07] bride of Christ Glory as the church we
[1:24:11] are there and the Lord says that that
[1:24:14] body of Christ of that faith of the
[1:24:17] Apostles and the prophet has to come
[1:24:20] back to Israel right there has to be a a
[1:24:24] body that believes the gospel the true
[1:24:27] gospel which is found founded on the
[1:24:30] prophets and the apostles with the
[1:24:33] revelation of the message that the Lord
[1:24:36] has given us in this last days so that
[1:24:39] church has to be there maybe few maybe
[1:24:43] five maybe 10 right that's not it's
[1:24:46] counted it's the body laid on the
[1:24:49] foundation of the prophet and turn their
[1:24:52] hearts to their fathers right so that
[1:24:55] body has to be there right and then the
[1:24:59] Lord just opened my mind and I said now
[1:25:02] this is what the Lord has brought us
[1:25:03] here amen that's how I when I look back
[1:25:07] that's how the Lord I said that L Lord
[1:25:10] you left me without father in the land
[1:25:13] of India and I lived there and in just
[1:25:17] after 3 years I received the Lord then
[1:25:19] in 75 I received the message and now
[1:25:22] here I am with the full understand
[1:25:24] understanding of the word and and the
[1:25:26] message and now the Lord has brought us
[1:25:28] together in the land of Israel so by
[1:25:31] God's grace my dear friends we wish to
[1:25:35] start a small group in in Israel now
[1:25:38] there are hundreds of Indian people that
[1:25:42] come to work in in India as a laborers
[1:25:44] in the fields and as a caregivers and
[1:25:47] some other things and many of them are
[1:25:49] Christians they are
[1:25:51] denominations they they they are they
[1:25:53] are from the denomination churches but
[1:25:55] they are Christians and they don't go to
[1:25:58] any church because I that's been
[1:26:01] preached in Hebrew or that's preach in
[1:26:04] English or that's preach in French and
[1:26:06] and any other languages or maybe
[1:26:08] together that's what the fellowship the
[1:26:11] the Jewish fellowships are there but if
[1:26:13] I let this word not out to the people
[1:26:17] giving them hand bills and different
[1:26:18] things and contact those people so those
[1:26:21] Indian people I can bring them by God's
[1:26:24] Grace and the leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:26] Come Together to worship with us in an
[1:26:28] Indian language right in the language of
[1:26:31] their own right and that can be a great
[1:26:34] attraction for them to come and to
[1:26:36] Worship the Lord in a place and then
[1:26:39] when they come there then we can share
[1:26:41] this message the gospel of the hour the
[1:26:44] message of the hour and that's how the
[1:26:46] Lord can give them an opportunity which
[1:26:49] they might not have received this
[1:26:51] opportunity in their land exactly
[1:26:53] because if you look to Trinidad if you
[1:26:56] look to Guyana and all those places
[1:26:59] those people now are Christians but if
[1:27:02] you go back their forefathers were
[1:27:05] Hindus in the land of India when they
[1:27:08] come from India the when the British
[1:27:10] government brought them from India they
[1:27:12] were
[1:27:13] all Hindus they worshiped different gods
[1:27:16] but now they got an opportunity to hear
[1:27:19] the Gospel of Jesus Christ and they
[1:27:22] received him and now they they have
[1:27:24] opportunity to receive the message and
[1:27:27] now there are people hundreds of them
[1:27:30] those Hindu oriented people believed on
[1:27:33] the gospel believed on the message and
[1:27:35] they have a church here amen bless so
[1:27:38] that's how the Lord can lead us to those
[1:27:41] people amen and not only that we have
[1:27:45] the people come from Africa being as a
[1:27:49] refugees in Israel the government of
[1:27:52] Israel has taken over them as a refugees
[1:27:54] and there are many Christian people they
[1:27:56] have their churches and they go holding
[1:27:59] their Bibles I saw them all over they
[1:28:01] hold their Bibles and go on a sabat day
[1:28:04] to the church they go to Pentecostal
[1:28:06] churches and I believe that there might
[1:28:08] be somebody that already knew the
[1:28:10] message right that already knew the
[1:28:13] prophet right but they might not have a
[1:28:16] place to go in so they are going to that
[1:28:18] churches but if the Lord just let the
[1:28:21] things go out and and be known to the
[1:28:23] people people I'm sure that they will
[1:28:26] come to worship with us so this how this
[1:28:29] is how the Lord is leading to me amen
[1:28:33] and I want you to pray because Israel is
[1:28:36] more expensive than India it's very
[1:28:39] expensive than India and in India after
[1:28:43] 87 I didn't come here to United States
[1:28:48] brother Wilson helped us in lot of
[1:28:51] things as I told you about the tape
[1:28:53] Ministry and about the uh copying
[1:28:55] machine and everything and he helped us
[1:28:57] on a monthly Support also till he was in
[1:29:00] charge of the church there but then
[1:29:02] later on that that help also stopped but
[1:29:05] we didn't stop there and there is there
[1:29:07] was no other Church no other Mission no
[1:29:10] no other brothers in United States that
[1:29:13] helped us in our ministry but Lord had
[1:29:16] given us that heart to serve him right
[1:29:18] and we always served him without help
[1:29:21] and with help and it has been so that we
[1:29:23] taught the people to give to the Lord
[1:29:26] right we taught them to give whatever
[1:29:28] they can it's very it kind can be a dime
[1:29:32] it can be a paining which they bring as
[1:29:35] a TI unto the Lord because their income
[1:29:38] is not that high they're all laborers
[1:29:41] they're just like uh workers you know
[1:29:44] there are other people good people we
[1:29:46] have doctors we have engineers in the
[1:29:48] church right but most of the majority is
[1:29:52] from the lower people right and they
[1:29:54] bring the tithe and all these years my
[1:29:58] dear friends I want to tell you that we
[1:30:00] serve the Lord we preached the gospel we
[1:30:03] preached the message and we did
[1:30:05] everything that we could do with all the
[1:30:08] support of the brothers and my family
[1:30:10] right when my mother was there she
[1:30:13] helped us on the ministry through a tith
[1:30:18] on other brothers other sisters they
[1:30:20] helped us on the tith and then in 2002
[1:30:24] my sons went to Israel and then they
[1:30:26] started to help on a greater scale and
[1:30:29] all that money was used among the
[1:30:32] Brethren among the pastors and the
[1:30:35] ministry that which we had if you see
[1:30:37] that video you will see that we every
[1:30:40] time we have uh open ground meetings we
[1:30:44] rent grounds uh school ground school
[1:30:47] open ground and we arranged there big
[1:30:50] meetings and the people they come there
[1:30:52] you know and to hear the
[1:30:54] and they come out of their denomination
[1:30:56] come out their religions come out
[1:30:58] catholism and know everything the Lord
[1:31:00] just works in that way amen and we spend
[1:31:02] that money on these meetings we spend
[1:31:05] money that one time these the city there
[1:31:08] I was when we preach this on the we had
[1:31:11] the open camp ground meetings and those
[1:31:13] ministers there you know their mind you
[1:31:17] know was so you know they got so much uh
[1:31:19] uh what I put you in English is that you
[1:31:22] know uh when we preach the truth yeah
[1:31:25] and all these years of their life in the
[1:31:28] in their teaching in their seminaries
[1:31:30] they were taught that there is a tri God
[1:31:33] there is a trinity and we come forth and
[1:31:35] bring them the truth that from where the
[1:31:37] Trinity has come right they they their
[1:31:41] mind was blown right because we bring
[1:31:44] them the truth and we bring them the
[1:31:46] history we we back up the Bible the word
[1:31:49] of God and the message together with the
[1:31:51] history and everything and we brought
[1:31:53] them from where these things has come
[1:31:56] revealed to them everything spoken about
[1:31:59] we I preach in India by God's grace
[1:32:02] anything that's come against the word of
[1:32:04] God I preach against catholism I preach
[1:32:07] against the nuns I preach against all
[1:32:09] the Traditions that they have and I took
[1:32:11] them back I took them back from where
[1:32:15] these things has come right I took them
[1:32:17] back these nuns I told them from where
[1:32:20] they have come they are nothing but the
[1:32:24] the the the being kept for the priest
[1:32:27] and the high priest I revealed to them
[1:32:29] through the books of the histories now
[1:32:32] everything is on the internet everything
[1:32:34] is on the internet I give them I said
[1:32:36] you if you don't believe what I have
[1:32:38] here as as a printed out you go you you
[1:32:42] search in these places and you'll get
[1:32:44] the information and their minds were
[1:32:47] blown and then they decided okay they
[1:32:50] said okay let us come together I said
[1:32:52] all right so about six six seven of them
[1:32:56] the ministers in those trinitarians from
[1:32:58] different denomination they come up
[1:33:00] against us okay I said we decided a
[1:33:02] place I said okay I'll pay the rent I'll
[1:33:05] arrange for your lunch and you come
[1:33:07] there we want to we want to see that you
[1:33:10] hear the word of God we'll present the
[1:33:12] truth what we have you come up and you
[1:33:15] present the TR truth what you have and
[1:33:17] let the people decide that what is the
[1:33:20] truth and they come up and that's that's
[1:33:22] in in one of the uh um in the clips
[1:33:25] there those five six uh the preachers
[1:33:27] they come in and we stood up and I I
[1:33:30] explained them very slowly and very
[1:33:32] slowly and very slowly just word by word
[1:33:35] and revealed them and spoke to them they
[1:33:38] were so amazed and they were out of
[1:33:41] their mind and when their turn come they
[1:33:43] said no we can't speak anything against
[1:33:47] this and they refused to come up they
[1:33:50] said we can't say a word against these
[1:33:52] things I said if this is the truth I
[1:33:55] said you better you believe it whe you
[1:33:58] receive it and that was the result that
[1:34:01] this Presbyterian Pastor opened his
[1:34:03] church this may for the meetings so this
[1:34:06] is the way the Lord has blessed us in
[1:34:09] India and it's been by just by God's
[1:34:13] grace that we has been doing all this
[1:34:16] with the money in India from India and
[1:34:19] it has been a great blessing to the
[1:34:21] people and our people are praying people
[1:34:24] they they go on the mountains and pray
[1:34:27] in the night they they they believe in
[1:34:30] fasting I believe in myself in fasting
[1:34:32] we fast many of days together and Lord
[1:34:36] just answers the prayer uh it's um and
[1:34:40] just I received a mail a few days on
[1:34:42] 27th of August that they had started to
[1:34:46] work in Pune in the city of Pune a big
[1:34:48] city in India and they are trying to get
[1:34:51] together all the message Brethren and
[1:34:53] have and hold a meeting there and they
[1:34:56] also gave me the news that there was a
[1:34:59] young boy who was possessed with a demon
[1:35:01] and they went and prayed for that boy
[1:35:03] and he was released by from the that
[1:35:06] demon and now that that family is open
[1:35:09] for the message and the truth and
[1:35:10] they're now holding a weekly meeting in
[1:35:12] those areas right so the Lord is working
[1:35:15] with us Glory my today's
[1:35:17] message I think I can take more 10 10 15
[1:35:21] minutes okay so now we see my dear
[1:35:23] friends that what I wanted to show is
[1:35:26] from the scripture and from our
[1:35:28] experiences that the Lord has blessed us
[1:35:32] why because our God is a living God Amen
[1:35:36] that's right amen amen the scripture
[1:35:38] which we read in the scripture the Lord
[1:35:40] says
[1:35:42] let man should not be alone it is not
[1:35:46] good for a man to be alone that's right
[1:35:49] my dear friends God never wanted man to
[1:35:52] be alone why why right what was the
[1:35:54] reason behind it because our God himself
[1:35:59] never wanted to be
[1:36:01] alone that was his attribute right
[1:36:05] that's why the Lord wanted Adam to have
[1:36:09] an help men right our God he could have
[1:36:12] just stayed there in a Majesty having
[1:36:15] all those millions of Angels standing
[1:36:18] before him y you know yep but he needed
[1:36:23] a help meate amen he needed a one that
[1:36:26] can have a fellowship with him and he
[1:36:29] needed a person that he can go and talk
[1:36:32] and spend time that could come and say
[1:36:36] God my Lord to worship him he needed
[1:36:39] someone to worship Him brother said if
[1:36:43] if there is no worshipper God cannot be
[1:36:45] God right if he has to be a God then he
[1:36:49] has to be a one that can worship him and
[1:36:51] that's why the Lord say that's why God
[1:36:54] created man that's why God created Adam
[1:36:58] that to worship him and that's how we
[1:37:00] see the God created Adam and it says
[1:37:04] it's not good for man to be alone that's
[1:37:07] right my dear friends so the Lord has
[1:37:10] given us friends has given us Brothers
[1:37:14] has given us wife so that we could stay
[1:37:17] in a company lord always wanted to have
[1:37:20] a company and he choosed man y which was
[1:37:24] created in his own image and in his own
[1:37:26] likeness so there he found rest in his
[1:37:30] people but we see my dear friends that
[1:37:32] Adam failed God and Adam and the God has
[1:37:35] to take Adam out of that fellowship and
[1:37:38] and the scene stood in between God and
[1:37:41] man right but at the same time lord
[1:37:46] always has a desire and we also when we
[1:37:50] have some friend something happens and
[1:37:53] that friendship is BR broken so we go in
[1:37:56] search of another friend and we find
[1:37:59] another friend because that's the
[1:38:00] quality that's that's that's the that's
[1:38:03] the inner part of us because God always
[1:38:06] wanted to have a fellowship and we also
[1:38:09] look for a fellowship and we also look
[1:38:11] for a friend and then we see that God
[1:38:14] looked on the earth and he found one man
[1:38:17] that's Enoch and then the Lords of the
[1:38:19] word of God said that Enoch walked with
[1:38:21] God for 300 years
[1:38:23] that Fellowship was intact for 300 years
[1:38:28] it's been we see in the in in this world
[1:38:30] we hardly have a friendship that can
[1:38:33] last maybe a year or a two or maybe
[1:38:35] three or four or five or something like
[1:38:37] that and that friendship is broken but
[1:38:39] here Enoch walked with God for 300 years
[1:38:44] then we see the Lord has another friend
[1:38:46] called Noah and the scripture says that
[1:38:48] Noah found Grace in the sight of God and
[1:38:52] then it says Noah walked with God Amen
[1:38:55] so that's the grace and then we come up
[1:38:59] then we see that
[1:39:01] Abraham was God's friend in Isaiah 418
[1:39:05] it says
[1:39:07] Abraham is my friend he is my friend
[1:39:10] right see Abraham was long back before
[1:39:13] the asaiah could come and speak but the
[1:39:15] Lord is still calling through asaiah
[1:39:18] that Abraham my friend right so we see
[1:39:22] that the relation which we come in with
[1:39:24] God is always remain the same that
[1:39:27] relation does not change because that
[1:39:28] relation is eternal relation and still
[1:39:32] in the days of asaiah God testifies
[1:39:34] about Abraham that Abraham is my friend
[1:39:38] thank you Lord amen then we see David my
[1:39:40] dear friends the God said that he is
[1:39:42] after my heart Moses he says there is
[1:39:45] there is no man there is no person as
[1:39:48] faithful as Moses in all my house so
[1:39:52] everybody will see had a different
[1:39:54] characteristics right had a different
[1:39:57] that everything the Lord call in a
[1:39:58] different way that look the Lord looked
[1:40:01] into the hearts of his people he Lord
[1:40:04] walked with Eno for 300 years God Noah
[1:40:08] had a Grace in his eyes Noah walked with
[1:40:10] God then God said Abraham my friend and
[1:40:13] God said Moses is the faithful servant
[1:40:16] that I have in in in all my house then
[1:40:19] Lord says David is the one is after my
[1:40:22] heart right my dear friends God always
[1:40:26] I'm keeping it short and the lord always
[1:40:28] has a desire to have a fellowship with
[1:40:31] man but he could come
[1:40:34] down every time in the book in the in
[1:40:37] the Old Testament if you see the
[1:40:39] scripture is used the word is used that
[1:40:42] I will come and I will be with you I
[1:40:45] will be with thy
[1:40:47] people he told Moses I will be with you
[1:40:50] he told Abraham he says I will be with
[1:40:52] you right I will bless you and Abraham
[1:40:55] and I will give this lamb to your your
[1:40:57] sons and daughters and I will be with
[1:40:59] you thank you Lord to David says I will
[1:41:03] be with you I will protect you I'll be
[1:41:05] with you and I will bless you and for
[1:41:08] for for Solomon he said yes I will be
[1:41:10] with you and my presence will be here in
[1:41:13] this Temple and whosoever pray facing to
[1:41:15] this Temple I will hear that that prayer
[1:41:18] of his see that was a presence of God
[1:41:21] right it says I will be with
[1:41:24] you but the Lord didn't want it to be
[1:41:27] with
[1:41:28] us lord always wanted to be in US amen
[1:41:32] amen and for that the Lord has to do a
[1:41:36] plan to come and to dwell in human
[1:41:39] beings and we see that was the plan made
[1:41:43] perfect in Christ Jesus Lord prepared a
[1:41:47] body the in Hebrews 2 chapter 14th and
[1:41:50] 15th vers it says that as such the the
[1:41:53] children were the partakers of the blood
[1:41:55] and flesh he also became and took part
[1:41:58] of the blood and flesh right so he came
[1:42:00] and he dwelt in Blood and flesh right
[1:42:04] Colossians first chapter it says nth
[1:42:07] verse he says in him dwelleth the
[1:42:09] fullness of godhead bodily second
[1:42:11] chapter nth verse in him dwelleth the
[1:42:14] fullness of godhead bodily and and uh
[1:42:17] Paul says in the book Apostle of Timothy
[1:42:19] he says without controversy great is the
[1:42:22] mystery of godl is that God was manifest
[1:42:25] in flesh right and he came down and
[1:42:28] dwelt in a man called Jesus Christen and
[1:42:31] revealed to the
[1:42:33] world and that's how the Jewish people
[1:42:36] could not believe Jesus right they
[1:42:40] thought how God can come in human beings
[1:42:43] right how this almighty
[1:42:46] God that holy God could come and dwell
[1:42:50] in a human flesh am there's this humbled
[1:42:53] and they said you call yourself God and
[1:42:56] they tried to took the stone uh Stone
[1:42:59] Jesus and then he gave the scriptures to
[1:43:02] him and that's how my dear friends we
[1:43:04] find the still today that the the minds
[1:43:07] of Jewish people are still blocked are
[1:43:11] locked my dear friends they cannot see
[1:43:14] God in human flesh but by God's grace
[1:43:18] that Revelation has been given unto us
[1:43:21] right that God come down yeah and dwell
[1:43:23] among his people and not only among his
[1:43:26] people in dwell in us he is in us the
[1:43:30] hope of glory first uh Colossians 1
[1:43:33] chapter and the uh sth verse it says
[1:43:36] that the hope of glory Christ in you
[1:43:39] amen Christ in you now that blessing has
[1:43:42] come to us right
[1:43:44] those 20 disciples in the upper room
[1:43:47] they were blessed with the blessing and
[1:43:49] that Holy Spirit came upon them and
[1:43:52] that's what the Prophet Paul says in
[1:43:53] Romans 8th chapter he says if that Holy
[1:43:57] Spirit by which God raised Jesus Christ
[1:44:00] from the dead is in you amen then he
[1:44:03] will raise you your dead bodies Asing
[1:44:07] amen so if that Holy Spirit mean who is
[1:44:09] that Holy Spirit that Jesus Christ he is
[1:44:12] not a different God he's not the second
[1:44:14] God and third God he is that same person
[1:44:16] but in in in as a holy spirit inj so now
[1:44:20] we have received that blessing through
[1:44:22] Christ Jesus that upon the cross he tow
[1:44:25] that ve in the two paths from up to the
[1:44:28] bottom and he made us an open place to
[1:44:31] come in the presence of God am to
[1:44:33] worship him and to call him Upon Our AB
[1:44:36] father and now in these last days my
[1:44:39] your friends God has revealed to us
[1:44:42] excuse me through the prophet bless him
[1:44:46] as we see the ministry of our brother
[1:44:48] branam that

[1:47:23] see when the children of Israel were in
[1:47:26] the Captivity the Lord came down and
[1:47:29] spoke to Moses and Mo and the Lord spoke
[1:47:31] to Moses he says I have heard the Cry of
[1:47:33] my people and that's why I have come to
[1:47:36] deliver them the Cry of my people Glory
