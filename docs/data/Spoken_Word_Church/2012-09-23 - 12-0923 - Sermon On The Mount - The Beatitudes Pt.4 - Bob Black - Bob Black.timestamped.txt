[0:00] William first named William his mother
[0:03] and father is in the message over in
[0:06] wherever it is
[0:08] and he's moved over here and just heard
[0:11] of the message a little bit so he didn't
[0:12] know we were here
[0:15] all right Matthew 5. Matthew
[0:21] okay
[0:24] this is this will be a little bit short
[0:26] today so we'll have plenty of time for
[0:28] upstairs
[0:32] and
[0:37] get ready to flip over to Acts chapter
[0:39] 2.
[0:42] so let's read through
[0:44] the Beatitudes
[0:47] Matthew 5 verse 1.
[0:50] and sitting the multitudes he went up
[0:52] into a mountain
[0:54] and when he was set his disciples came
[0:56] unto him
[0:58] and he opened his mouth
[1:00] and taught them
[1:02] put this on and taught them
[1:09] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[1:12] theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:14] Melissa are they that more for they
[1:16] shall be comforted
[1:18] blessed are the meek for they shall
[1:19] inherit the earth blessed are they which
[1:21] do hunger and thirst after righteousness
[1:24] for they shall be fueled
[1:26] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[1:28] obtain Mercy blessed are the pure in
[1:31] heart for they shall seek God
[1:33] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[1:35] shall be called the children of God
[1:37] blessed are they which are persecuted
[1:40] for righteousness sake for theirs is the
[1:42] Kingdom of Heaven blessed are ye when
[1:45] men shall revolve you and persecute you
[1:48] and shall say all men are of evil
[1:50] against you falsely from I see now all
[1:54] of these are
[1:55] the Bible is full of these promises of
[1:58] God that are promised to the believer
[2:02] and and uh we've got to if we'll believe
[2:06] these we'll fulfill all of these
[2:07] promises in our lives so let's uh kind
[2:10] of review
[2:12] the first four Beatitudes kind of show
[2:15] uh the character of the believer that's
[2:17] being called to a relationship with God
[2:19] the poor in spirit because you realize
[2:22] that you need something that you can't
[2:24] uh you can't you can't manufacture in
[2:28] yourself you begin to mourn
[2:30] uh and grief
[2:33] to the things of God and then the next
[2:36] you uh meeknesses you're willing to be
[2:39] taught and then you begin to hunger and
[2:42] thirst for righteousness the the
[2:44] requirement that God requires of all of
[2:46] us
[2:49] and then uh maybe a better title for
[2:52] this will be the uh the kingdom of
[2:55] heaven
[2:57] because now uh how can you really be
[2:59] merciful unless you've been shown Mercy
[3:02] today how can you be pure and heart
[3:04] unless God has given you something in
[3:06] your heart that makes you pure and
[3:08] peaceful and then uh you become
[3:11] uh just part of the it's a problem it's
[3:15] really a promise from God that if you
[3:17] have all of these attributes you're
[3:18] going to be persecuted and uh I think a
[3:21] lot of times if we don't get that
[3:23] Revelation that we're going to be
[3:25] persecuted that it can produce
[3:26] bitterness in us if we're not we don't
[3:28] realize that persecution is going to
[3:31] come and uh
[3:34] you know when the early saints were
[3:36] persecuted they counted as a as joy as a
[3:38] blessing and they rejoice when they were
[3:40] persecuted and that's how we should
[3:42] approach it
[3:45] remember God calling I can't do it
[3:47] morning for sin they're able to be led
[3:48] and long until we feel
[3:52] and now we're all hungering and
[3:55] thirsting for righteousness and remember
[3:57] we talked about when that first stage of
[3:59] the believer's journey it's like the
[4:01] Believers when they would come from
[4:03] miles around from all over the world
[4:05] they'd come they see that the temple
[4:08] looming over uh the Mount of Olives the
[4:11] Mount of Olives was the the path of the
[4:13] often most of the Blues would come in
[4:14] and just as they crested that Hill
[4:16] they'd come over and see the temple uh
[4:19] the the place they've maybe had long to
[4:22] see all their life and then they'd come
[4:23] into those five gigs come under
[4:25] Solomon's ports and begin to hear the
[4:27] word because they had come with a hunger
[4:30] and a thirst it only makes it Satisfied
[4:32] by God okay so let's see um
[4:38] that's the same Temple that Jesus said
[4:40] it won't be one stone left on another
[4:42] stripe
[4:44] there's nothing of that people anymore
[4:46] it's gone
[4:58] I was throwing some of these notes
[5:00] together last night let me figure out
[5:01] where I am
[5:03] um
[5:09] so let's kind of just to set the stage
[5:11] let's flip over to Acts chapter two to
[5:13] see how
[5:15] these four characters characteristics
[5:17] were manifested in the Believers that
[5:20] first heard
[5:23] the gospel
[5:28] preach when Peter and the disciples came
[5:31] out on the upper League
[5:33] I just kind of want to read through Acts
[5:36] chapter 2 verses 14.
[5:42] through
[5:44] 14 onward
[5:50] Acts chapter two
[5:53] let me go back to this slide
[6:05] think of think on these as we read
[6:06] through Acts 2 verse 14.
[6:10] so all the people from all around the
[6:12] world parthians and Meads and elamites
[6:14] and people from everywhere or outside
[6:16] when they came out and they accused of
[6:19] being full of new wine and then Peter
[6:21] was full of Holy Ghost and he started he
[6:23] launched into his sermon
[6:26] that produce these characteristics in
[6:29] all the men that were gathered all the
[6:30] people that were gathered that Day verse
[6:32] 14 but Peter's standing up with the 11
[6:34] lifted up his voice and said unto them
[6:36] you men of Judea and all you that dwell
[6:39] at Jerusalem beat us known unto you and
[6:41] hearken to my words
[6:43] so these are not drunken as he's
[6:44] supposing it's about a third hour of the
[6:46] day but this is that which was spoken by
[6:49] the prophet Joel
[6:51] so now maybe just kind of Imagine these
[6:53] these men are beginning to realize a
[6:56] scripture from the Old Testament
[6:57] scripture are being called for to put in
[7:00] their remembrance of what was taught in
[7:01] the Old Testament and they're beginning
[7:03] maybe to be convicted in their soul and
[7:05] realize that I all the uh we'll look at
[7:08] in a second to see what the Old
[7:10] Testament scribes had to say about
[7:11] righteousness that it was something that
[7:13] you did in yourself that Europe it was a
[7:16] moral code that if you get in yourself
[7:19] um be greater than all of your iniquity
[7:21] then you would achieve righteousness but
[7:23] these men on this day they're realizing
[7:25] there's something something that uh only
[7:28] comes from God and Peter is telling them
[7:30] is not your righteousness that's
[7:31] required but the righteousness that
[7:34] comes by faith laughs
[7:37] well these are not broken as you suppose
[7:39] seeing as what the third hour of the day
[7:40] or this is that which was spoken by the
[7:42] prophet Joel and it shall come to pass
[7:44] in the last day he said God I will pour
[7:46] out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[7:49] sons and your daughters shall prophesy
[7:51] and your young men shall see Visions in
[7:52] your old men shall dream dreams and all
[7:55] my servants and all my hand meetings I
[7:57] will pour out in those days in my spirit
[7:58] and they shall prophesy and I will show
[8:01] wonders of Heaven above and signs in the
[8:03] earth beneath blood and fire and Vapor
[8:05] of smoke the sun shall be turned into
[8:08] darkness and the moon and the blood
[8:10] before that great and notable day of the
[8:13] Lord come they shall come to pass that
[8:14] whosoever shall call in the name of the
[8:16] Lord shall be saved give me individual
[8:18] hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man
[8:20] approved of God among you by Miracles
[8:22] and wonders and signs which God did by
[8:25] him in the midst of you of you that he
[8:27] yourselves also knew him being delivered
[8:30] by the determinative counseling for
[8:32] knowledge of God ye have taken and by
[8:34] Wicked hands are crucified and slain now
[8:37] here we get to the point where now
[8:39] they're getting convicted and it's time
[8:40] to mourn right we the man that we
[8:44] thought
[8:45] we didn't realize what we had done
[8:49] whom God hath raised up having loosed
[8:51] the Pains of death because it was not
[8:53] possible that he should be holding of it
[8:55] for David and now meekness
[8:59] and we'll get well we get down to their
[9:02] confession after Peter has been finished
[9:04] his in his sermon meekness is willing to
[9:07] be taught and now Peter's beginning to
[9:09] teach them from the word the Old
[9:11] Testament thing put putting things
[9:13] together so they can realize
[9:15] how the Old Testament scriptures
[9:17] testified and it's killing them aside
[9:19] for David speaking concerning him I
[9:21] foresaw of the lord always before my
[9:23] faith for he is on my right hand that I
[9:25] should not be moved therefore did my
[9:27] heart rejoice and my tongue was glad
[9:28] moreover also my feet my flesh shall
[9:31] rest and hope because that will not
[9:34] leave my soul in Hell neither will I
[9:36] suffer thy Holy One to see corruption
[9:38] thou has made known to me the ways of
[9:40] life thou shall make me full of joy with
[9:42] accountants
[9:43] men and Brethren let me freely speak on
[9:45] the year of the patriarch neighbor that
[9:47] he is both dead and buried in his
[9:48] sepulchers with us under this day
[9:50] therefore being a prophet
[9:52] and knowing that God has sworn with a
[9:54] note to him that of the fruit of his
[9:55] loins according to the flesh he would
[9:57] raise up Christ to sit on his throne
[9:59] he's seeing this before speaking of the
[10:01] resurrection of Christ that his soul was
[10:03] not left until neither his flesh did see
[10:05] corruption this Jesus hath God raised up
[10:09] wherever we are we all are witnesses
[10:11] therefore being by the right hand of God
[10:13] exalted and having received of the
[10:15] Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he
[10:17] hath shed forth this which he now see
[10:20] and hear from David is not ascended into
[10:22] the heavens but he saith himself the
[10:24] Lord said unto my Lord sit down on my
[10:27] right hand
[10:28] until I make that for the footstool
[10:30] they're full of all the house of Israel
[10:32] knows surely that God hath made that
[10:34] same Jesus who ye have crucified both
[10:37] the Lord and Christ amen now when they
[10:40] heard this the fourth one right they
[10:41] realized that they needed something that
[10:43] their own righteousness could not
[10:45] provide and they began to hunker and
[10:46] they said all right now teach me what do
[10:49] I need to do and when they heard this
[10:51] they were pricked in their heart instead
[10:53] of the Peter and the rest of the
[10:54] Apostles men and Brethren what shall we
[10:57] do tonight and Peter said unto them
[10:59] repent and be baptized every one of you
[11:02] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[11:04] mission of your sins and that here's the
[11:06] promise if they had hunger and thirst
[11:07] after righteousness shall be filled and
[11:10] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[11:13] Ghost and then after you receive that
[11:15] Holy Ghost you will continue to thirst
[11:17] and righteousness as you're filled on up
[11:19] the statue of the perfect man the
[11:21] promise is unto you and to your children
[11:22] and to all that who are far off even as
[11:25] many as the Lord Our God shall call
[11:36] thank you
[11:40] so we're hungry and thirsty
[11:43] longer to be filled with his
[11:46] righteousness and um
[11:49] you know I was thinking it
[11:51] I was thinking of a little story that uh
[11:54] you know what we think that um
[11:56] you know Bible says press on for the
[11:58] market of higher calling and call so we
[11:59] can press on but we can't press our
[12:02] loved ones you can't could you imagine
[12:03] all the disciples maybe hurting everyone
[12:05] into that Temple you can't force anybody
[12:08] to hunger and thirst but God has to call
[12:11] me God doesn't push he pulls he pulls us
[12:14] through the three fools and it
[12:15] fellowship with him
[12:17] and I was uh just thinking about a
[12:20] little story that I tested him on that I
[12:21] heard years ago where this little sister
[12:24] um she had been praying she had a
[12:26] daughter and she was praying for her to
[12:28] receive salvation and one day they were
[12:30] in a uh
[12:31] they were in a church service and a camp
[12:35] meeting
[12:36] and um
[12:39] the the Holy Spirit was moving and the
[12:41] altar call had been made and people were
[12:44] coming up to be saved but the little
[12:45] girl was just sitting there and she
[12:47] wouldn't uh the mama was sitting next to
[12:49] her and she was praying that God would
[12:52] move on the scene and she this was
[12:54] wisdom she realized maybe they helped a
[12:56] little girl maybe she should leave the
[12:59] room so she left and went out and she
[13:01] was just praying that God would move
[13:04] would pull on her Heartstrings
[13:07] and something happened to that girl and
[13:09] she uh she said she felt there was
[13:12] nobody sitting around her but she felt
[13:13] my hand on her back slap her and push
[13:16] her forward and she went forward and uh
[13:19] and gave her heart to the Lord and
[13:22] that's um
[13:24] that's you know we can't push anybody
[13:26] but God ain't pulling yes sir and uh
[13:29] amen I I was just I've seen so many
[13:32] times how if you're really if you can
[13:35] get in a sincere desperation and pray
[13:39] for your loved ones believing that God
[13:41] will God will pull them he'll do it
[13:43] he'll because it's a promise that it's a
[13:47] promise unto you and to your children
[13:49] and all that are far off and uh a little
[13:52] far along we'll get in the house all
[13:54] these promises of God is is becoming to
[13:57] us to fulfill every promise every word
[14:00] in the Bible and especially in this last
[14:03] day amen
[14:10] so Philippians 38 of 14 we were reading
[14:14] about um getting into hungry and thirsty
[14:17] for rightness righteousness
[14:20] and uh
[14:21] Paul City eggs outlets and I count all
[14:23] things but lost for the Excellency of
[14:25] the knowledge of Jesus Christ Jesus my
[14:27] Lord
[14:28] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[14:30] things and you counting but done that I
[14:32] made with Christ and be found in him not
[14:34] having my own righteousness another law
[14:37] but which is through the Faith of Christ
[14:39] the righteousness which is of god by
[14:41] faith that I may know him in the power
[14:43] of his resurrection and the fellowship
[14:45] of his sufferings being made conformable
[14:48] unto his death
[14:49] if by any means I'm not attain the
[14:52] resurrection of the Dead
[15:01] so what is righteousness
[15:04] and I was just looking up the history of
[15:06] of where this word righteousness in in
[15:08] the Old Testament the word righteousness
[15:11] was translated by tendo the original was
[15:14] uh this word called said
[15:16] and uh there's this old uh scholar that
[15:20] the Jews highly regard from my name is
[15:22] who said said it was or a Sadiq was one
[15:28] whose marriage surpasses his iniquity
[15:31] so that's good how can your own career
[15:36] pass your iniquity and that's the
[15:39] Revelation that this Jew these these
[15:41] people from all around the world on the
[15:42] day of Pentecost when Peter came down he
[15:44] preached him a sermon that's your own
[15:46] Merit will never surpass your iniquity
[15:48] that you need something
[15:50] that only God provides is his
[15:52] righteousness amen and uh
[15:55] then down through the the gothic
[15:58] translation and so forth that that word
[16:00] began to be written as write-wise
[16:02] right-wise and Tyndale translated it as
[16:04] righteousness and that the word
[16:06] righteousness actually came from William
[16:08] Pennell he he was the first to use that
[16:10] and then he used righteousness to
[16:12] translate both acidic in the Old
[16:14] Testament and to chaos in the New
[16:16] Testament which means um that that had a
[16:19] people use that and a lot of ancient
[16:22] writings to mean things like holy person
[16:25] like the uh
[16:28] um
[16:29] The Maccabees were said to be the chaos
[16:32] because they were they were revered as
[16:34] holy people and uh in Stones it says
[16:38] your righteousness is being approved by
[16:42] God or wholly conformed to the will of
[16:45] God Amen let's see what um
[16:52] and Jeremiah Jeremiah said behold this
[16:55] is where uh look at that word
[16:58] acidic
[17:00] and Jeremiah we've got the word Jehovah
[17:04] behold the days come and saith the Lord
[17:06] that I will raise up to you unto David
[17:08] or righteous pranks when the king shall
[17:10] reign and prosper and shall execute
[17:12] judgments and Justice in the earth in
[17:15] his days Judah shall be saved and Israel
[17:17] shall dwell safely and this is his name
[17:19] whereby he shall be called the Lord our
[17:21] righteousness which is when the old
[17:23] Hebrew is Jehovah
[17:25] because he is our righteousness amen
[17:30] 1933-15 and Jesus saves me said unto him
[17:33] this is when he came to John to be
[17:35] baptized and John said I need to be
[17:38] baptized with you and Jesus said he
[17:39] suffering to be so now for unless it
[17:41] become with us to fulfill all
[17:43] righteousness but then he suffered him
[17:45] and I just take a little a little break
[17:48] and find out why did Jesus need to be
[17:50] baptized amen
[17:54] let's go back to Exodus
[17:57] 29.
[18:00] okay
[18:07] this all has something to do with us
[18:10] that's right because Jesus had to
[18:12] fulfill on a license for seven weeks
[18:18] in Exodus 29 verse 1 through 8
[18:24] start at verse one
[18:26] and this is the thing that thou shalt do
[18:28] unto them to hallowed him the minister
[18:30] under me in the priest's office take one
[18:33] young bullet and two rounds without
[18:34] blemish blemish and unleavened bread and
[18:37] cakes unleavened temperate oil and
[18:39] Wafers are living Anointed with oil of
[18:41] Wheat and flowers shall not making and
[18:43] thou shalt put them into one basket and
[18:45] bring them in the basket with the
[18:46] Bullock and the two rails and Aaron and
[18:48] his sons Thou shalt bring into the door
[18:50] or the Tabernacle of the congregation
[18:52] that shall wash them where you are
[18:54] because the high priest must be washed
[18:56] with water before it can be anointed
[18:58] just like our journey we've got to be
[19:01] washed with water and then the anointing
[19:02] the baptism of the Holy Spirit goes on
[19:04] us the anointing Came Upon Jesus to
[19:07] enter into his ministry at the River
[19:08] Jordan but before that could happen he
[19:10] had to be washed with water to fulfill
[19:12] the word and to meet every requirement
[19:14] of the word
[19:16] verse 5 Thou shalt take the garments and
[19:19] put up on air in the coat and the robe
[19:21] of the ephod and the ephot accessibility
[19:24] with the Curious girdle
[19:27] of the e-file and thou shalt put the
[19:29] minor upon his head and put the holy
[19:31] crown upon the miter they shall they
[19:34] shall thou take the anointing oil and
[19:36] pour it upon his head and anoint him so
[19:38] first the high priest was washed and
[19:40] then he was anointed outside so that's
[19:42] why Jesus when he said we've got to
[19:45] spill all righteousness
[19:50] and Bud random said
[19:52] in 1961.
[20:00] I'm jumping the guns let's get back
[20:11] so um I I was listening to the sermon
[20:14] that come with us to fulfill our
[20:16] righteousness and brother and went
[20:17] through the story of Noah how he um
[20:21] John came with him with a word told him
[20:23] exactly what to do with his life and he
[20:27] his his whole objective his whole goal
[20:30] in life was to fulfill what God had
[20:31] spoke for him to do so he went and he uh
[20:34] despite everything that the world did he
[20:37] um you build an art even though the
[20:39] whole world calls him call him crazy and
[20:42] when that art was built he fulfilled
[20:44] God's word for that day amen then he eat
[20:46] it God gave him a revelation of how to
[20:50] escape the natural plane and he built a
[20:53] pyramid and Bill Branham told the story
[20:55] about one day he uh
[20:57] just his wife and his children goodbye
[20:59] and he took a stroll a little bit
[21:01] different than he has any scroll that he
[21:03] had taken before and he walked on off
[21:05] the Earth because Enoch was fulfilling
[21:07] his righteousness for his day he was
[21:09] fulfilling God's plan
[21:11] and then Daniel think about how he was
[21:14] tested to uh the king he said well
[21:17] you're gonna have to eat the slop off
[21:18] the king's table you're gonna have to
[21:20] eat all the Pig stuff and everything
[21:21] that God's word forbids you to do and he
[21:24] said well you just feed us Feed Us
[21:26] vegetables and things that are Kosher
[21:29] and uh because he fulfilled the
[21:33] righteousness that he fulfilled God's
[21:35] word for the day he ended up healthier
[21:37] than the rest of them eating all that
[21:39] slop off the King's Day
[21:42] and uh in this sermon
[21:44] he was telling all these stories and
[21:46] right in the middle he got word that his
[21:49] mom was dying I think this you know

[21:55] when he said all right they sent word
[21:57] for me to pray for Mom right away I'm
[22:00] about to stop and just say pray for her
[22:02] now doctor just left all right now Lord
[22:04] Jesus I'm standing here that's my mother
[22:06] if she's going I can make her soul into
[22:08] the hands of God but here's a message
[22:10] that's got to go all over there's a
[22:12] living here that's got to die you've got
[22:14] the Lord I'm yours in Jesus name it's
[22:16] becoming to us it's becoming to me now
[22:18] that I fulfill all righteousness God's
[22:21] word comes first no love like like God's
[22:25] love so it's just so beautiful you know
[22:28] right in a new life ceremony he gives us
[22:31] a just a a great example of putting
