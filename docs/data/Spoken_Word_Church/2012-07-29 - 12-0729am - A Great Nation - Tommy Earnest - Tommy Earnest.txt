trying to preach everybody this morning I don't know who's here I don't know I don't know who's here so we just trying to help you out Y how many you glad to be Christians this morning I am glad to be

young couple on over here back here from they're living in South Carolina now brother Allan gouby and his wife Nancy have been friends of ours for man a long long time when me and him was both young long yeah it has been a long time but it's good to see him here I'm glad I told him we were get getting this close and we didn't have any time to come over to their house so we just invited them over here and here they are so we're sure glad to have you all this morning we uh those of you that made it out to Kansas in May and and visited with us we'll never forget that you know that's always a memorable time and brother Donnie there got to come out and and big old motor homes made their way all the way out there and back and we had a wonderful time let's read our scripture while you're standing and and just Genesis 12 now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee right and our text is right there in verse two and I will you got to remember the part of that I will make of thee a great nation we're going to talk about a great nation a little bit this morning the steps that Abraham went through to fulfill this I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and I will make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed in verse four so Abram departed just like that so Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him now there's a quote I want him to put up out of the Easter seal before we pray and and as we read this quote I want you to think about Abraham it's down in that second part where brother brandham talks about there he says now let me my my sister my brother let me say to you in Godly fear knowing that I may never live to see an Easter again but there's one thing sure you want a sure thing from Brother brand here it is y when a genuine for ordained Son of God by the word of God hears that voice of God right he'll rise and go to meet it that's right that's right now not everybody is going to rise and go to meet that they let's qualify that again when a genuine for ordained Son of God by the word of God hears that voice of God he'll rise and go to meet it how many believe Abraham started us on that way because the Lord said get thee out and Abraham just got out that's too easy isn't it it's the potentials that he's going to meet the real living word amen let's pray Heavenly Father this morning it's so good to see the house full and all these people coming out to worship you and to to sit under the word these few minutes we pray you'll bless them you'll encourage our hearts their hearts encourage the the the minds of the people to continue steadfastly looking into the things of God progressing along moving on the journey just as Abraham did and we pray this morning Lord that the things we say knowing it's their their time what they call a Sunday school lesson and a a time for beginning to look into the word we pray that we'll have something that'll that that'll quicken in their hearts and minds and give them courage for the journey ahead cuz it's been a long journey already it's been a tiring Journey sometimes we think the people are just tired and and and we understand that but we pray Lord to yes today that you'll just bless us in your name amen amen God bless you you may be seated it's all right because of warmth I'll just take my coat off right away and and El but yeah it's good to be here it's been like what 7 months now now we were here at new years's and so all of you that are continuing the journey here we just we just appreciate you being here and being out this morning we trust the Lord will help us help us in our in our text today amen of course nobody is more enjoyable to preach on than Abraham I mean he's just it it's not only easy because brother brandham has already told us so many things about him but it's just a joy to preach on our Father Abraham and this quote way down in 1965 just matched up to those verses so well in Genesis 12 that I had to read the two together right because as we as we're going to look and some of the things we'll quote and say from Brother bram's message will'll be very familiar to you but Abraham was just an ordinary man and you'll see that in a few I many remember brother BR telling us that over and over and over there was some things that we had to learn about Abraham or as he was known as Abram here in Genesis 12 that that helped us on the journey but let me say again brother Pinkston texted me a little bit ago while I was back there and said said to make sure to greet you all I know he's been out here with you before and and and like I said we get enough of y'all coming our way now to to keep us mindful of who you are and and we have good Fellowship I I I I do have to stick a fork and I my brother waited here every once in a while to make sure he still he still treats me right we just he come to my house and he just he was just there at my house that's all I can say you know we we sure enjoyed having him out and got to put him up in my home and that that was just a real blessing they they take care of us well so y'all y'all got some Fine Brothers Here leading the church and helping you in the word of God and we appreciate that and we appreciate yall being here this morning but but we're going to quickly look and I know it's a morning and and I've never had a a 10:00 and then a 2:00 service so this is new for me so y'all are used to that but I man I've heard so many things are going to happen this afternoon I I didn't write them down I'm going to get them out of order I mean I'll be up there at to baptism and y'all will be having a baby shower down here at the church so so I'm going to have to follow because I I they they gave it all to me in one big lump package and now I don't know what I'm supposed so y'all just if you see me wandering around aimlessly not knowing what's going on then you'll understand it that was just too much information for an old guy like me at one time so so y'all just follow along help help me preach this morning help me get through this and then hopefully we'll come back this afternoon and look at it some more and the good thing about two services that close together is maybe you won't forget what I said this morning by this afternoon so so maybe you can retain it and hold on to it for just a few hours and we don't have to go back and am and regroup and and do too much of the morning but but but the promise to Abraham I will make of thee a great nation now let's look at a couple other vers go flip over one page there Genesis 13 I want you to see a few of these verses together and and it seems like every time and you'll notice as we run through a couple of these that every time the Lord came and had anything to say to Abraham he kept telling him the same thing over and over watch this verse 14 Genesis 13 and verse1 14 the Lord said unto Abram after the lot was separated lift up your eyes look from the place where you are northward Southward Eastward Westward all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it to thy seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth amen think of that he just told him here one chapter earlier when he first met him y that's that's his first meeting when he first met him he said Abram I'm going to make a great nation out of you hooks up with him again here in Chapter 13 and he says you know Abram here's what I want to tell you today I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered right amen same thing he told him over there in chapter 12 I'm going to have a great nation you're go over to Genesis 15 flip over one more page you're going to find Genesis 15 and verse 4 and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine air of course he's asking about about the other one there but he that shall come forth out of thine out of thine own bow shall be thine air and he brought him forth a broad and he said look now toward Heaven Y and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be am same message same message three chapters same message going over to Genesis chapter 17 you reckon the Lord wanted Abraham to understand something come come on amen you talk about a Johnny one note this is a Johnny one note message for Abraham I am going to make a great nation out of you they're going to be like the dust of the earth they're going to be like the stars of Heaven he told him in chapter 17 Abram now he's 90 years old and nine he was only 75 back over there in chapter 12 here he is 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to him and said I am the almighty God walk before me be thou perfect and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will mult M Supply thee exceedingly he fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and you'll be a father of many nations right neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram but thy name Shall be Called Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee and I will make thee exceeding fruitful right I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of thee amen ain't that amazing one message this is all I got to say to you Abraham leave your Kindred come out and I am going to make a great nation out of thee and when he got a a chance to talk to him again you know what God's message was I will make a great nation Out Of Thee I will multiply Thee I will increase thee exceedingly right now we know what Abraham's seed became but quickly go over to Exodus chap 1 and I want you to see one thing as we get into our text because you'll find something and I found this very alarming after God comes to Abram over and over and over and after his name was changed to Abraham he's coming by and he's telling him the same thing but we get over to Exodus chapter 1 and the scripture tells us these are the names of the children of Israel which came into Egypt every man in this houseold came with Jacob Reuben Simeon Levi Judah isachar zebulun Benjamin D Napal Gad and Asher look at verse 5 and all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob right how many 70 right 70 wait a minute wait a minute I'm going to make a great nation out of thee yeah I'm going to multiply thee exceedingly right and 200 years later through four generations now I know you're sitting down you're thinking oh man what's what's wrong with this picture that's what I was thinking right 70 the the souls that came into Egypt out of the loins of Jacob were 70 Souls now that's Abraham Isaac and now Jacob right and there's 70 Souls of that house of Jacob right went into Egypt for Joseph was in Egypt already yep 70 now I I I just only want to stop here and have you think about that for a a minute because Abraham had already lived through 25 years of frustration okay come on no y'all I know what you're going to do you're going to jump over there where Paul said Abraham believed and it was accounted unto him for righteousness and Abraham had a great time walking around for those 25 years well I'm going to disagree with that how wonderful of a time he was having he tried a few times to help God's program along right sure did but do you see the point trying to make after 200 years through Abraham through Isaac through Jacob the seed of Jacob was 70 right y 70 Souls y right now of course if you read just a couple of more chapters you'll find out and the children of Israel were fruitful right brother random said when the time of the promise draws nigh God has a way of making it work out right amen right see I want to stop I'm going to hammer this down for just a minute because I want you to understand understand Abraham's mental dilemma every time I talk to you Lord I'm going to be multiplied I'm going to be fruitful there's going to be lots of me yeah I'm going to have kids and grandkids and they're there's going to be many many many fruit the sand of the sea the stars of heaven but after 200 years he calls a family reunion yeah with Jacob and all of his family and you know how many show up 70 right I know there's more Dales than that around here yeah come on come on that a that won't even scratch the Dale family exactly after 200 years Abraham's promised lineage had grew to 70 I me believe he had to hold on to the promise how many you believe he had to instill that promise in Isaac's heart and in Jacob's heart because we find out that soon after they got down there into Egypt the Pharaoh looked around and said wait a minute something is happening here to Abraham SE yeah they are multiplying like rabbits I mean there are just children of Israel everywhere and so what did Pharaoh do he started on a population control yeah yeah sure he did There Rose up a pharaoh we could read it but to save time there rose up a pharaoh who knew not Joseph right and so he looked around and all these Israelites were were were growing in numbers and he said wow if another king invades us they're going to join up with him and we're going to be in trouble so we better do something y you know what the first thing he was to hold down the seat of Abraham was he the first thing he did was he worked the men so hard come on you remember read it you can read it when you go home put them to work we're going to take away your straw but we need just as many bricks as you ever gave us before sounds like our economy today don't it come on come on how many believe the devil will put you under so much Financial strain even if you've read Dr Ramsay's book but he will still put you under so much Financial strain that the enemy will come along and say man you need two jobs or three jobs in order to make it come which if you do that we'll take you right out of church and you'll never have time for God anymore that's what Pharaoh does pharaoh said look we got to hold this down and so what he did he worked the men so hard that when they would get home he was hoping they wouldn't come in under their wives and bear more children yeah M is't that what the enemy wants us to do work so hard he wants us I was telling somebody the other day it used to be when I first came in this message back in the in 1969 in those early years those 7s people would move 200 miles to go to a church you don't find that happening no more now they're moving 200 miles away to go to a job back then they' leave their job and come to the church and now they'll leave the church and go to their job what's wrong with this picture that's right right but but these children of Israel were multiplying until a few hundred years later we went in 70 and how many came out yeah right 2 million right the promise was not negated right the power to fulfill that promise lay in the promise itself Abraham I will help you I will do this I will multiply you and then when the time of the promise Drew nigh Israel began to populate right amen and Pharaoh looked around says wow how they do populate how they are growing right and so he he be but of course after the after he worked the men so hard there was still children coming so he said well we got to do something else let's just uh get the midwives on our team and we'll hire The Midwives and when the children are born we'll just have them take care of at that point in time we'll you know how miserably that failed The Midwives says we don't want no part of that Pharaoh called him back in says what's wrong you're not doing what I told you so well man these Hebrew women when they when they have those babies they're Lively and they're just there we know it right the babies come and and man sounds like some of our message churches don't it that's right amen some of our message churches are building themselves one baby at a time you know just the nurseries aren't big enough anymore right amen but but the point is he said the midwives fail so then he said hey that's not working let's let's just throw them in the river yeah you remember how that that went you know there was an amram and right and a joker bed down there say wait a minute this child is born a goodly child and that's why brother and when the time of the promise of bringing those children out after being down there for 400 years when the time of that promise Drew nigh God raised up a deliverer and you know the story of Moses and we're on Abraham we're not going to get to Moses but the point that we're trying to make is this the promise began to be fulfilled right and and and this is the text we want to look at this morning go back with me if you will and I want you to follow and I and I'm going to be real conscious of the time so we have time for our lunch and our all the things that we're doing today but we'll go back to Genesis if you will and again in chapter 12 you got to First establish anytime you talk about Abraham you got to First establish some of the most fundamental principles of his life that brother brandham gave us there's a quote in Israel in the church that I want you to notice Genesis 12 and verse1 the Lord said Abram get thee out and I want you to notice in this message it's in Israel in the church 19 53 he says brother R says Abraham was coming from Babylon with his father down into Shar the valley of Shar where the souls of many journeyed after the destroying of Babylon or the confusion Abraham's father parent brought Abraham and his loved ones down into Shar and all that land listen at this quote now all that land among all those people God found favor with one brother Rand stops he says one man found favor with God now here's an odd statement for brother Rand to make now I want you to notice that is the beginning of Christianity of the church right mhm think of that that is the beginning of the Christianity of the church right amen everybody out in the land might not understand what brother brandom is saying because they'll say well Calvary was the beginning of Christianity of the church right but brother brandham took it back to Abraham he said I want you to notice that is the beginning of Christianity right amen I know you got you're going to think of some other things brother Ram said he said back in the garden that Cain was worshiping and Abel was worshiping so maybe maybe he didn't really mean what he said but you have to understand him looking at Abraham mhm what brother brandom is telling us that here's he goes on follow with me just a minute I want you to notice it wasn't because Abraham was a good man it was because God elected and chose Abraham right it wasn't Abraham choosing God it was God choosing Abraham can you see it that's right and now watch now as it was then so is it today it isn't you choosing God it's God choosing you that's right how many don't like to hear messages on Election you know why you enjoy them because you believe you're a part of it I love messages on election man I didn't choose God God chose me on on down in the message after that one called Jehovah Gyra 1957 now God called Abraham not because he was Abraham God called Abraham by election right Abraham was no good man right no better than anybody else that's right he probably come out of the group of idolators down there from the Tower of Babel where they worship the roots of the ground he was a root worshipper yeah and God chose him yeah and they had a woman up there she had all kinds of curious arts and practices if you've ever read the history that's where the first organized church ever begin was in Babylon by Nimrod organized all the cities and they paid tribute now Abraham's father brought him down from Babylon they dwelt in the city of ER in the land of Cala and Abraham and over and over brother brandham uses these words Abraham was just an ordinary man like you and I amen just an ordinary man oh I I want you to get it God by forn knowledge called and elected Abraham he knew his heart he knew him before the foundation of the world and Abraham only fit into God's program oh my brothers and sisters if there's anything I want this morning and that is to fit into God's program by election and by calling I want to fit into God's program wherever that is that's right and Abraham's wife was named Sarah on down in a message called Jesus on the authority of the word word brother says seeing Abraham back there no more than any other man out of the land of Cala coming down from out of The Valleys of Shar perhaps an idolator perhap but God God by Sovereign election shows him that's right Abraham I have saved you and your seed after you oh God told him to look at the dust of the earth and number it then the Sands of the sea and then the Stars of Heaven innumerable I like this little quote his seed would be coming from the dust to the Stars oh don't you see brothers and sisters over and over brother Brandon wanted us here's some I'll run through real quickly but God called Abraham not because he was good but because God chose Abraham notice Abraham was just an ordinary man come down from Babylon he dwelt in the land of Shar perhaps his diet was he'd go out in the morning and he'd picked some berries from the the bushes go out and kill an animal and have his Noonday meal and some more berries for supper and so forth and while Abraham being just an ordinary man God chose Abraham by election that's right how many are glad you can sit back and say man I just want to be ordinary right you know being ordinary in 2012 ain't quite good enough for most folks no they got to be something being ordinary ain't very popular anymore because who wants to be ordinary I do right because brother said Abraham was ordinary just like me and you picked berries in the morning killed an animal for lunch pick berries in the even one place brother R said he did pretty well financially in the land yeah he one place brother R said I got here he said he wasn't much of a Holiness man why he was an idolator he was a farmer down there farming berries and and worshiping the roots of trees and God called him and said Abraham come out I am going to do this to you unconditional how many times did Brother R use the word unconditional when when when working with Abraham all over and over one day Abraham was out walking around at 75 years old there he goes again married to Sarah she was just a girl 65 years old don't you see he made in Abraham's Grace Covenant brother said he made it to Abraham not Abraham if you will do a certain thing I'll make a great nation out of you and make you a father of Nations he said I have done it Glory when it let me tell you and then let me read this other quote and you'll understand why brother brandham called Abraham the beginning of Christianity in Israel in the church in 1953 brother Ram says he elected Abra Abraham now listen and that was the very beginning of our Salvation right right amen God's call to Abraham was the very beginning beginning of our Salvation that was given to a man when he called him and elected him and predestinated him and gave him a promise and made a covenant with Abraham and his seed forever he said we could go ahead and read a full chapter but we haven't got the time God called watch when he called Abraham here he called him by election amen not because he was because God was that's right don't you remember this is the point of Abraham and brother brandom in two places over here he said it was the beginning of Christianity and Not only was it the beginning of all Christianity it was the beginning of our Salvation now why would brother renam tell us that amen it's because he's looking at a man yeah a man that Paul wrote over there that and said in in Galatians that Abraham believed and it was accounted unto him for righteousness amen that's right brother brandham looked at the beginning of Christian ity is simply being a man that could be walking around living an everyday normal life very ordinary and he could have the word of the Lord come and speak to him right and he would just simply say if I can paraphrase sister hadie right that ain't nothing but the truth right amen right that was the beginning of Christianity was when the word came and a man who had no background no training no religious experience nothing good about him he was an idolator he wasn't a Holiness man he was an ordinary man and Christianity began when a man could hear the word of the Lord and could believe it and follow it amen and say that ain't nothing but the truth right amen all I'm trying to say to you brothers and sisters is Christianity began that way and Christianity is going to end that way because there is going to be a bride here in the end time that can simply look at the word of the Lord that can stare at it and the word of the Lord can come and it can be quickened to her and all she can say is what Abraham said I believe it that ain't nothing but the truth and Christianity will go out the same way right Christianity came in that way and there's going to be a little bride standing here in the end time that says we shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep but we shall all be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an ey how are you going to go help that program along right amen come on I can't even change myself that's right I'm sure I can lose a little weight I can try to get some six-pack abs under all these layers of other fleshly matter that is there covering them over I can do that but that ain't going to change me that's not going to give me a glorified body to meet him in N right I am sitting here like Abraham was a word of the Lord that says you are my elected I have chosen you to fulfill exactly my plan oh I go into churches sometimes and and you know everybody you know the old Pentecostal way you remember the old Pentecostal way of testifying and I I hope I ain't picking on nobody here I don't mean to do that oh oh get a good old Pentecostal sister up and she get all emotional oh I just want to go home so bad you remember those test I just want to see Jesus just that's good I mean we all want to see Jesus right yeah just want to see Jesus is so bad and sure enough the next week she'll come down with some kind of an ailment yeah and and I'm sitting around thinking I just heard her say she was wanting to go home right yeah but the time I get back to church you know what's laying on the pull pit of prayer request oh my those two things aren't adding up right I thought she want to go home all of a sudden she's down at the doctor looking for some stay longer pills come on are you following me that's right see sometimes we don't know what we want I feel like Paul whether present or absent I want to be accepted if I go by the way of the Grave I want to be accepted but I am here believing that as the bride in the end time there is an elect lady that will take a change of the body and I want to go home but to be honest with you I want to go that way right amen I mean I'm going to keep this old fell around as long as I can it gets a little bit morbid when you get the the other way right I used I used to sit back and say man she want to go home she want to go home you know and then she gets sick and she don't want to go home so I was confused we all want to go home we want it to be over but we want to be here because the word has promised there is an elect lady that will fill that word sir and I believe brothers and sisters we are living in that age everything we have from this message convinces us and if it's all right you I'm just going to hang around till then amen and if I don't hang around then just wish me a goodbye and I'll see you very soon there's no shame in those hav gone on before there's no disgrace because they're getting up first amen come on y I'm not going to stop them no you know everybody reads it we not prevent or hinder you know what prevent or hindering that means we're going to God won't even let us get in the way of that happening we shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep but they shall be quick and they shall be raised amen that's right don't you see that is the very beginning of Christianity the beginning of Salvation when there is just simply an ordinary man that can look at the word of God that comes to him and he can rise and go to meet it amen that's what Abraham did when he hears the word a for ordained son hears the word he'll rise and go to meet it and that's what Abraham did and that's all we can do here in the end time is rise and go to me whatever part of the word thank you Lord It's fulfilled in it you're going to ask me then do you believe you're going to be here till the change yes my dear brother yes that's right I believe the Lord has let me come in an age in a time when that word is going to be fulfilled amen and I want him to continue quickening in my heart this word to pull me to that chain to pull me to that Resurrection amen I'm counting on right that's right I'm only 53 you're talking to a man that thought it would be over in 1977 right yeah I mean y'all been around that long we did everything leading up to 1977 we had the little purple books we we prepared we we did everything we could do to get ready because we just we just didn't we did the best we could we didn't understand I where we live there in Tennessee the dear brother he was doing the best he could at one point in time he had a stored up canned goods I never could quite figure out what that was about yeah canned goods aren't needed for the change I want you to know that don't rush home and stock up your pant you ain't going to get through the squeeze unscathed I hate to tell you that this morning that's right I don't mean I don't I don't mean to man man get all depressing now I gets to talk about the squeeze you're not going to get through unscathed right I don't know how to read those quotes about when that little hunted persecuted group how do you put little hunted and persecuted into one sentence and think we're going to get by yeah yeah right when brother brand said you that follow the pillar of fire you're going to have a rough time of it right and I know and I forgive me but I know some well that's going to be a mental squeeze well yes we're going to be mentally squeeze yeah but I don't think little hunted and persecuted in a rough time go along with a mental squeeze when I'm traveling I'm still staying in the holiday ends I mean that's not the squeeze yet I want you to know that that's right come on oh would you don't understand I can't pay my power bill that's the squeeze your power bill is not the squeeze the fact you can't make your mortgage is not the squeeze the squeeze is the wrath of Satan where the Book of Revelations tells us that he will be very wroth right and he will come after a little hunted and persecuted group and the only reason you will be squeezed is because you are identified with that Pillar of Fire there are many Believers message Believers that the squeeze will be going on and they won't even know the squeeze is on right because they're not identified with the pillar of fire amen and I don't even want to preach on I got notes on it but I don't want to do that right because as soon as you do everybody go oh man we got to get some more shotguns more more ammunition yeah there ain't enough ammo ain't enough food ain't enough of your abilities do I look forward to it I'm no you know I don't like pain right I don't like pain my wife left my charger cord to my electric shaver in the hotel in Ohio the other day can y'all believe she would do that and so I had to get me one of those mock threes out of the out of the drugstore the other day and a can of shaving cream and I cut my lip this morning right here I'm still hurting I can't hardly talk to y'all and that's my wife's fault back there that's right am cuz I said have you got everything think I got everything yeah it's right here can you see it it's swelled up it hurts it's not her fault I plugged it in over there where we left it there you go and I remember the court dropping down kind of behind the little cabinet they had there so true brother true so it ain't my fault even though I plugged it in we have a wonderful system my wife and I when we travel I do nothing and she does everything it's a great system see yeah she does I got a great system I lay there on the bed tell me when we're packed if I feel well I will help you get it out to the car no I help get it in the car but she does all the packing gives me something to talk to her about I can come charging out of the I had to come out yesterday I can't find nothing I mean you think you'd be able to find the stuff you need you pack you that's true brother way is right if I packed it I'd know where it was but the Lord has been good gave me a wife that could put up with me that's right yes sir and I could go on and say that for sister June back there oh man yeah I tell you what it's gotten to where they're inviting sister tun Back to Witch talk I I I guess they assume brother Wade will come along but yes the Lord is Blessing you amen all right my goodness my goodness but do you see our where where was I at we're down to that point of the beginning of our Salvation was simply a man that could take the word of God and say right as sister hadri did that ain't nothing but the truth what's expected of us here in the end is to take that reveal word and simply believe and it was accounted unto him right for righteousness amen now see we always we we we all man up here in the end time we read all these things about Abraham and when our minds go to Abraham all we can remember is the good stuff yeah right how many agree with me come onen sure how many when you think of of your father Abraham remember because because Paul over there says that that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in faith holding on to that promise and I read that scripture and Paul is just like us we're looking back at Abraham and all we can remember about him is the good stuff right yeah but when a Paul said Abraham staggered not at the promise of God I'm I'm again sitting back reading the scripture and saying wait a minute wait a minute hold on Paul I'm reading Genesis and I'm reading about Abraham living through 10 or 12 12 of those 25 years without the promised son right and I'm remembering Hagar coming along Sarah saying wait a minute Abraham it's not working out I done what did Brother say she had done knitted so many booties they were piling up all around her waiting on the promised son and she came along and said Abraham what about taking Hagar my handmaid and fulfill the promise through her yeah so Abraham went to the Lord and said well if you're going to ask you just go ahead and do it that that yep yeah and I'm remembering that but Paul's getting over there and this is a good quote that brother brother Brandon made let me read it out of the message of Grace in 1961 he said when I think of Abraham of all the mistakes that he made right see brother brandom thought about them mistakes too all right when I think of Abraham of all the mistakes that he made and Moses and his mistakes but when Abraham's commentary was written now listen when the Divine commentary was written right when Paul wrote Abraham's commentary he never mentioned one thing about Abraham's unbelief no no never was even accounted to him amen right when I think about it brother brand says don't don't don't un christianize me for me thinking about it because brother said when I think about it and all the mistakes he made come on oh brother say my humble prayer is before the grace of God that's here this morning I hope mind wrote like that that he won't see my mistakes that's right that when my commentary is written my obituary that it won't be read out that I made mistakes and done wrong but he'll only see the things that I tried to do for him sir oh my he'll take the grace of God that I believe in and that's where I'm solely trusting upon my merits I could no more go in none of the rest but upon the grace of God I'm depending yes it's Grace that I'm depending on brother sister when I think of Abraham he mentioned all the mistakes he mentioned ishmail coming on the scene trying to fulfill the promise of God brother R in one place he says how could Abraham go down there and let ailec take his wife like that he says that ain't even a Christian thing to do to let another man take your wife to save your own skin right he said that's not even right that's a mistake Abraham made but yet when Paul wrote that commentary the Divine commentary aren't you glad there's a commentary and Divine commentary yes sir what we all see here living every day rubbing shoulders together bumping into each other that's commentary right but on the other side my dear brothers and sisters there's a Divine commentary and in that Divine commentary is wrote over the top I am my beloveds and he is mine and His Banner Over Me Is Life there is a people that can believe that in spite of all of our mistakes in spite of all of our stumblings in spite of all of our blunderings that we are still yes amen that's right oh don't you see God knew the heart of Abraham oh I'm only interested in the Divine commentary right that's why when I go over there and I read Paul that great author brother brand said Paul had one thing in mind as he taught on adoption and that was to knock out every fear of ever falling away right right right knock it out y not stand up and remind people if you don't do this you might not make it and if you don't do that you might not make it and if you do that there's no hope for you yeah brother brandom said Paul had to knock that out of the people's mind that they could be saved one day and then fall again the next day and then save back again another day you know what brother R call that kind of preaching nonsense right he said that's nonsense he said once you have the Holy Ghost you are sealed until the day of your Redemption Lord but preachers will still get up and they'll they'll they'll they'll read you your commentary right this natural you did this and you did that and you did this and you you and and all I can see is you doing all of these things I've had to remind some brothers along the way but there is a Divine commentary ready I will acknowledge yes I stumbled yes I fell yes I have to repent every day just like brother brandham did right but in my Divine commentary it's not even written I am like Abraham right he wrote A Commentary about me on the other side that said he never did it go back to Invisible Union of the bride ask me how many times brother brandom can say she never did it she never did it she never did it talking about that bride but the devil will come along and say I know you did it and and he knows you did it and she knows you did it and you know you did it we all know you did it he's just reading the wrong commentary there is a Divine commentary that says though I may fall 10,000 times he'll pick me up again because I'm his all that kind of teaching on a is hard on people brother said when you get to teaching on predestination and adoption and God's sealing you in that's hard on people y sure it's hard on people it's not for everybody that's right not everybody can grasp on to that there's there's a little quote I want you to notice this is an Abraham and his seed after him is this water yes sir this water are you sure not thank you find this quote for me Abraham in a seat brother starts out I'm going to put two books up here we put two books up here and he was laying two books like this and call these books to Abraham and his seed after him yeah now what he did for Abraham he done for his seed after him glory amen all that understand that Clearly say amen amen amen now now if you notice in Genesis 12 God called Abraham by election not because Abraham had done anything to deserve it he might have been an idolor I don't know at Babylon they worship roots and Abraham had come down from there with his father now God called him by election now I want to stop here on this teaching on election and I want you to notice this next quote now God called him by election he says now Brethren my precious darling Brethren if I happen to get out of order in the scriptural Doctrine will you just forgive me for it and know it's my ignorance will you do it that's a nice nice sentiment you my precious darling Brethren if I get out on a election here and and I'm teaching will you just forgive me for it dot dot dot question mark you see it there and he says and my theological Brethren out there if you feel my Doctrine is wrong will you just forget it yeah right I want to stop there a Mane these kind of things always strike me a little alive I'm going to I'm going to shove this down I'm going to teach on Doctrine election hearing about Abraham and he says now my precious he's got how many will believe with me from that quote that brother brandham has two sets of Brethren sitting out there in front of me one group is called my precious darling Brethren and the other group is called my theological Brethren he says now my precious darling Brethren out there and that's the group that wants to follow the word that wants to receive from the ministry that wants to hear what God is doing he says if I get out of order will you just forgive me for it that's one group yeah and he says now my theological Brethren out there if you hear me teaching something that you don't agree with you know what I want you to do I want you to go out and forget about it yeah that's what he said will you just go on and leave the meeting and forget about it because why it ain't for them right there's the precious there's going to be theological Brethren as long as we are here I want you to know yet and they are going to hear things and years down the way they're going to wonder about the cloud and they're going to have problems with this and that and the other and there's going to be theological Minds that are going to look at this message Y and they're going to argue with you until doomsday yeah they're going to argue with you until the change of our bodies and they're going to go on forums on the internet and they're going to debate back and forth about this word and they're going to get all mentally stimulated by it Y and they would have been better as brother random said if you are a theological brother and you can't get it then just forget about it right there are a lot of message churches it would have been better if they had have stayed in the organization and never come out because they've turned into Cults we got Cults inside of this message they' have been better if they had never heard the word of God it have been better if a a millstone was hanged about their neck and cast into the sea than they would to be to take this precious word that that was delivered by Elijah right and just debate it and and question it and make a oh I like that and you theological Brethren if you feel my Doctrine is wrong here's what I want you to do just forget about it yeah right just call out act like you weren't even here now brother Rand gets into what he mean now many of you people are wri me letters brother R should we do this or should do that I say ask your pastor I'll do anything I can to answer you on great fundamental Evangelical doctrines of the Bible but when it comes to should we do this and do that always refer to your pastor each man there isn't two here but what would disagree with one another on little technical things whether we should comb our hair on the right side or the left yeah I ain't had much disagreement about that I like what brother brand says in mine I have no trouble with that some of us have gotten there already ain't we yeah I ain't having a whole lot of trouble I'm just about do it with a wash rag now it's getting so getting so thin up there that's right yeah little technical things that's not what we're talking about me and brother Wade can sit and talk long enough we ain't going to agree on something that's right me and my wife can sit and talk brother brand said we ain't going to agree on nothing there's things that are going to happen yes little technical things oh my goodness is this message filled up with little technical things right right you saw it even when brother Brandon was here I love questions and answers there is no more wonderful book for you to get and and have some of your questions answers in those old cood volumes they called them conduct order and Doctrine brother random never labeled them that right but what they did is they took all the questions and answers and and they began sending in questions about little technical things yeah sure I love reading questions and ask but you get in there sometimes and you'll find out brother brandom should a woman wear man's pajamas is that men's garments yeah you got Elijah of Malachi for standing there on the scene and he's trying to worry about somebody's pajamas should a man wear a flat top haircut well I don't know there's some of those questions brother would just laugh and he'd say am I reading this right am I am I seeing things here I am I just done been through the seals and in 1964 they're still asking me about pajamas and flat top haircuts right come on brothers and sisters right amen technical things little technical things so I tell people now based on that one quote alone if there's something you don't agree on and and you think man that brother Tommy just way out there gotten lost his mind just forget about it just forget about it if you're a technical brother now if you're if you're one of my precious Brothers then you just forgive me and we'll talk about it in the all right I got to quickly go to my text let's go back to Genesis chapter 11 if we can I want to quickly go through this and I want you to understand how before we close I want you to understand how much of God's program this was how much of God's program remember the beginning of Christianity was a man who could stand there and simply believe the word of God y time after time I'm going to do this for you I'm going to do it I'm going to do it it was God's program right yeah and the Fulfillment of the word here in the end time is also God's program there is no way we can help this program along right then you know you're going to be like what brother said then why you preaching if it's all wrapped up in one big core of election and then why you preaching he said preaching is God's program that's why we still do it is so that that word will hopefully quicken in your heart but I want you to notice something with me here's God calling Abraham let me ask you before we read this how many love the those long genealogies in the Bible how many of you ever read the genealogy let me get an honest response I like crowd participation how many of you are ever reading over in Deuteronomy and Leviticus and even over in the New Testament about the lineage of our Lord and so and so be so and so and so and so be so and so so right yeah how many of you ever skipped that yeah come on everybody how many of you never skip how many read every word of the Bible I know you probably read through them at sometime or not but if I'll be honest with you I get into genealogy sometimes and I'm like wow that's a lot of information I don't know any of those people but this one is important and I want to show you why this one genealogy I hate to read genealogies in front of the church but I got to do this one Genesis 11 how many know who Abraham's great great great great 10 generation back grandfather was there was only three come out of the AR right ham sham and J how many of you can you I I I asked for guesses one day people were getting the wrong one they they said ham and Jet but it was sham right Shem was Abraham now how many know and I ain't got time for all this but how many know from Adam to Noah was 10 Generations absolutely you know from Noah to Abraham was how many right 10 Generations right see the the the Earth had become defiled back in Noah's day and God said wow the Earth is so wicked and corrupt after 10 Generations I'm just going to wipe it all off well Noah came out on the other side and you know what had happened by 10 Generations Nimrod and Babylon and all the rest of it and God had promised he wouldn't destroy man again so he says I'm going to build my church another way yeah rather than wipe it off and have one man start over again I'm just going to choose a man out there by the name of Abraham and he's going to fill the world with righteousness because it was accounted unto him for righteousness you see the after 10 generation but here was sham and I want you to follow with me from from verse 10 of Genesis 11 now these are the generations of shim shim was 100 years old got to get my glasses on because some of these are are you got to get it now he was 100 years old he begat our fact said 2 years after the flood and shim lived after he at our facts that 500 years and notice what it says and begat Sons and Daughters right now we're going to read that nine times and when I get to that part that's y'all's crowd participation okay let me read that again and shim lived after he began our facts at 500 years and begat Sons and Daughters read it with me I want I want to drill that home before we get to the end of this genealogy and begat sons and daughters and our fact had Liv 530 years begat Sal our fact had Liv there after begat sa 43 years and begat Sons and Daughters sa lived 30 years begat EA sa lived after begat e 43 years and begat Sons and Daughters Eber lived 4 and 30 years begat pel Eber lived after begat pale 400 year and 30 years and begat Sons and Daughters P lived 30 years begat rud P Liv after begat rude 209 years and begat Sons and Daughters R lived 2 and 30 years begat sah R lived be Sarah 207 years and begat Sons and Daughters Sarah 30 years begat neor Sarah lived after begat ahor 200 years and begat Sons and Daughters neor lived n years n and 20 years beg got terara neor lived after he beget Tera 119 years and beget sons and daughters are you getting the picture from sh on down y every generation he had this eldest and then he had more y the eldest and more the eldest and more and begat sons and daughters and begat sons and beg what was the lineage of shim it was a very prolific right it was a very fertilized nation that was coming along how do I say that every generation it was it was prolific with children y Sons and Daughters after every one of Abraham's grandparents and we get down to terara right he Liv 70 be got Abraham neor haran these are the generations of Tera verse 27 Abraham neor abror tan haran begat lot haran died again more of that genealogy stuff that just helps us along verse 29 and Abram and nahor took them wives the name of Abram's wife was Sarah the name of ne's wife milka the daughter of heran the father of milka and the father of Isaac verse 30 but all of a sudden after 10 generations of children yeah there's one man Abraham comes along out of the loins of Sarah out of the loins of of of tra and he married a wife named Sarah but Sarah was Barren right she had no child but Sarah was Barren and God says and God says there's a man down there named Abraham Abram he's he's going to marry a wife and her name's Sarah and out of his loins out of his loins I am going to make a great nation right I'm going to have so much population out of the loins of Abraham it's going to be as the dust of the earth and as the sand of the sea and as the stars of Heaven y right and you know what just so everybody will understand this is my program you know what else I'm going to do I'm going to give him a Barren life yeah yeah yeah you want it to be all God's program you will understand that right there right amen Sons and Daughters Sons and Daughters 10 Generations if I was sitting back on the sidelines and I was saying Lord you need to choose a man if you're going to have a great and mighty nation and you're going to have population springing out from his loins surely surely you wouldn't hook him up with a baron wife right come on I'm looking at the program of God and I'm thinking he did a pretty good job picking Abraham right because Abraham's 10 Generations back were breeders yeah right how do I tell you that any other way right they were breeders children more children Sons and Daughters all of them until we get down to Abraham yeah and Abraham says I want the people and his seed after him to understand one thing this is my program and I will make of thee a great nation and you know how I'm going to prove it to you Abraham Sarah will have a son and one of these days you're going to take him up on the mountain even though you've had another child by Hagar over there and I'm going to remind you to take your son your only son up there on the mountain exactly the only one that's counted right the one that's got a Divine commentary written behind his name and I want you to offer him up don't you see brothers and sisters if I was in God's shoes I would think that's a good choice Abraham is a good choice his grandparents all behind him has a huge family but I'm going to choose Abraham and I'm going to give him Sarah and you know what I'm let turn over to Genesis 25 this is in the and the Lord is sitting back there thinking and you know what I'm going to make it even harder because once he gets Isaac and once he has that promise son after Holding Out for 25 years yeah and Isaac grows up and he's going to choose him a wife over in Genesis 2519 these are the generations of Isaac Abraham's son Abraham begot Isaac Isaac was 40 years old when he took rebe at a wife the daughter of bethuel the Syrian of padanam the sister to laan the Syria Syrian and Isaac in treated the Lord for his wife are you with me why because she was baren exact come on Abraham your seed is going to number as the sand of the sea and as the stars of Heaven you're going to be a father of Nations great Nations Kings will come out of you and you know how I want to prove to you it's going to be my program I'm going to give you a Barren wife and you're finally going to get the promised son and guess what he's going to get a Barren wife right because why God wanted his seed to know it was his program right amen that she was not able to reproduce herself amen and if that wasn't bad enough go over to Genesis 29 you you know what's next right come on Jacob verse 28 fullfilled her week he gave him Rachel to wife laan gave to Rachel his daughter Billa he went under Rachel and he loved also Rachel more than Leah served with him yet seven other years and when the Lord saw that Leah was Barren he opened her womb but Jacob's dearly beloved wife Rachel was Baron right Abraham I am going to make the Nations multiplied right and you know I said it the other day when I was talking to the home church about this you think about that if you were Abraham you got Isaac you got the promised son now he's running around he's growing up at 12 years old you went up there to sacrific him the Lord stayed your hand all that's behind you you would think after all the 25 years of frustration that Abraham had the first thing he would have been telling Isaac is look man whatever you do when you go get a wife I want you to make sure she can have children that's right come on now I don't know how they would have known back then but but I would think that he would be like come on Isaac ask around is her family fruitful is is but he gets him a wife and she's Barren and then you would have thought when it come Jacob's turn and he was on down the way looking for a wife y that that Isaac would have been like wow me me and your grandfather Abraham we already done been through this yeah we done been down this road now I am suggesting when you choose a wife check it out somehow figure out ask her family check around put out some feelers see if your wife can have a baby or not but God In by divine grace and Sovereign Grace amen for three generations is it a mystery to you now why when it got down to the loins of Jacob how many were there 70 right and they weren't even all out of the the barren wife there was Leah's children there was the handmaid's children on both sides and then there was Joseph the promised son amen but God's promise was still being fulfilled and that's all I'm trying to say to you this morning in the face of all that impossibility right in the face of all the inability of the natural lineage of Abraham to fulfill the word the word was still fulfilled and those 70 Souls went down there in Egypt and they came out of Great and Mighty Army and a great nation will I build you amen and that's what I'm saying to you this morning my dear brothers and sisters even though the the natural cards were stacked against the Fulfillment of the promise the promise was going to be three three generations of barrenness I like something one of the commentators said about Isaac when and musicians can come if they want to come up now one of the one of the Jewish writers talked about Isaac when him and Rebecca went up there to entreat the Lord that they would be healed you know where they believe he went right back there on Mount Mariah where he had where he had been spared right they believe that he took Rebecca back up on there to mount Mariah and he said look honey he said this is where I was raised from the dead and the promise that God gave to my father Abraham will fulfill in us and they entreated the Lord and the Lord opened her womb and then we get down there to and Jacob entreated the Lord and the Lord opened her room now that was you know we're going to look back and that that's a good commentary but it wasn't fun days in those days either I mean laan is producing the children Rachel is Baron y oh my yep aren't you glad you're one of them amen aren't you glad that there's a Divine commentary written that says I am one of them let's stand together and sing it there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all of flame with the fire that fell at Pentecost there are people people almost everywhere is burning in my heart glory to I can say I'm so glad I can say I'm one we are the SE of ab my Fai right we have the same promise promise AB when I can say I'm I'm I'm glad I we are when the bride realiz she is but she's do here what we do is taking what he I'm I'm so glad I can say I'm know where I'm going wor I can you find every time there brother those that weing you'll find that God always appears and say you're children will be like Abraham s the pr kept coming down M said we could be there with her Why Don't We Believe said you ain't got enough Faith believe for your children he said I doubt you having enough Faith to believe for yourself with my heart glory to his name I'm so glad I can say I'm I'm I'm soad I I'm one of you I'm I can I say I'm I'm I can I'm you do for you I'm so I'm I'm I'm not a candidate for baptism this I've been baptized three times say three times yeah one was Father Son and Holy Ghost we didn't know about that another one is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we believe that but is in Israel we got a chance to get baptized so there was four of us we got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and if I went back tomorrow I'd go back and get them to baptize me again it'd always be in the
