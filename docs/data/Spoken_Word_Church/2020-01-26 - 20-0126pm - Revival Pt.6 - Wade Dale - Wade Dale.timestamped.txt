[14:53] working on and we're gonna see about
[14:54] doing it is the children that are eight
[14:57] and below somewhere in there we're gonna
[15:00] be showing a video in my Sunday School
[15:05] class on the big screen for them for
[15:08] entertainment because as we were talking
[15:11] several weeks ago about this is kind of
[15:13] a submarine deal we're all living in
[15:15] this tube you know so while we're having
[15:18] Bible study I know you parents want to
[15:21] listen to Bible study but a lot of times
[15:23] your kids get really loud and get
[15:25] distracted but they're kids they're
[15:28] they're kids they do what and I tell
[15:30] these people into when I go deliver a
[15:32] package and the dog starts barking and
[15:34] ground they said all be clapping Clyde I
[15:36] said it's a dog that's what he does
[15:40] leave him alone just keep him away from
[15:42] me but leave him alone but same way with
[15:45] kids they like to play and so we're
[15:48] going to take them in my Sunday School

[15:51] show them a vegetales or some kind of a
[15:54] really good eight and below movie during

[16:02] thank God all you are coming I mean
[16:05] we're having 40 and 45 people every
[16:11] Bible study now and that's not counting
[16:14] the kids so the middle yeah some of you
[16:19] other ones ought to try it anyway
[16:27] Bible study next Saturday but we will be
[16:29] doing that and we're going to try it for
[16:30] the little kids and I brought two I had
[16:32] a kind of a suggestion to do that so my
[16:34] sister and I so we'll see if we can do
[16:38] that with the eight and below keep their
[16:40] attention for a little while and and
[16:43] then let them the ones in the Bible
[16:45] study have time for Bible study so also

[17:28] brother Joey usually has them downstairs

[17:56] won't take very long we'll nap in
[18:01] between and then we'll get back up and
[18:03] do it again so thank God for a wife that
[18:08] stuck with me for over now eighty
[18:10] seventy five percent of my life she's
[18:13] been with me solo so thank God for that
[18:16] she gets all the chicks yeah I would be
[18:24] single probably if it wasn't for her
[18:27] so revival revival part six and we're
[18:31] going to start again in songs but we're
[18:32] going to we're going to talk about a an
[18:36] atmosphere today and we're gonna get our
[18:39] keep our background and then we'll get
[18:43] to that because some of the things that
[18:45] brother Brown says it's like brother
[18:48] Dale saying though they without us
[18:49] should not be made perfect
[18:50] there wasn't a perfection they come to a
[18:54] completion for their age but there never
[18:57] was a perfection like you and I are
[19:00] coming to you because they went in the
[19:02] ground you and I are not going in the
[19:05] ground we're going to become fully
[19:06] mature fruit and then what we're gonna
[19:08] do we're gonna be harvested up not down
[19:13] and then so just keep that in you in
[19:16] your heart just pray for us and Lord
[19:19] bless all of these Psalms 138 verse
[19:24] eight - Heavenly Father we thank you for
[19:28] this evening this afternoon you give us
[19:30] a time Lord set aside to speak about you
[19:32] we pray this you would just be with each
[19:34] one we were the ones Lord that are in
[19:37] the sanctuary here that need prayer that
[19:38] may be sick Lord we know that there's in
[19:42] our bodies there's different things that
[19:44] are going on and we pray that you would
[19:46] just give us supernatural strength Lord
[19:48] - to handle the pressure of the day
[19:50] father you told us through the Prophet
[19:53] that we were astronauts we're in the
[19:55] astronaut age so we're able to to take
[19:57] the pressure of the time lord but lord
[20:00] we pray to that as the pressure comes
[20:03] you said is we're going to speak in a
[20:05] minute that you
[20:05] lifted up a standard or to take care of
[20:08] these things and we pray Lord that you
[20:10] will do that in this time that we need
[20:13] you father more than anything in the
[20:14] world probably give us this day our
[20:16] daily bread forgive our sins be with the
[20:20] ones Lord that are not here that are
[20:21] steak the ones watching in the ones that
[20:24] are that are getting a little older Lord
[20:26] we pray that you just bless them father
[20:28] and give them supernatural strength
[20:29] father just bless the ones Lord in the
[20:32] foreign fields giving them fruit for
[20:33] their labor just give us today Lord our
[20:36] daily bread we ask these things in Jesus
[20:38] name Amen
[20:40] I also be praying with me I I talked to
[20:42] brother Keith Reed the other day and he
[20:45] wants me to go to Africa with him so you
[20:49] just pray we'll see I don't know though
[20:54] I walk in the midst of trouble they'll
[20:56] wilt revive me thou shalt stretch forth
[20:59] thine hand against the wrath of my
[21:02] enemies and thy right hand shall save me
[21:04] the Lord will perfect that which
[21:07] concerning me just like I said this
[21:14] morning and we're starting a study on
[21:16] revelations and we started right there
[21:18] in revelations 1 you know John was so
[21:21] confident I want us to be so confident
[21:24] because John was so confident because
[21:25] when Jesus was on earth he said there'll
[21:29] be one among you that will not die until
[21:32] you see my kingdom coming remember then
[21:36] the then the the the story or the rumor
[21:41] went out that that Jesus was coming back
[21:43] before one of them was going to die well
[21:45] that was not what he's actually what was
[21:47] gonna happen
[21:47] but what happened was every when all of
[21:51] the twelve except John died a martyr's
[21:53] death never lived to be I think John
[21:55] lived to be like 96 years old so he was
[21:58] an old guy but he lived to go to the
[22:02] Isle of Patmos and John said I was on
[22:03] the Isle of Patmos and then God told him
[22:06] to take what he saw and take it to the
[22:10] church so see there's another promise
[22:11] John knew he was gonna get off the
[22:12] island because they want no tax no what
[22:17] no email
[22:18] had to be handwritten and had to be
[22:20] hand-delivered so he says what take what
[22:23] you see John and deliver it to the
[22:25] churches so you see those those are just
[22:28] real simple promises but I believe John
[22:30] took those promises is that hey I'm not
[22:32] gonna die until this happens
[22:34] what did Simeon say Simeon said the Lord
[22:37] has told me I'll not die until I see the
[22:40] Lord's Christ
[22:42] what kind of promise should me and you
[22:44] take out of the Bible that we can't die
[22:48] because we're in a certain time in a
[22:50] certain era in a certain age that we can
[22:53] take the promises of God and we can be
[22:56] as John and see not just prophesy about
[22:59] the coming of the Lord actually
[23:01] physically see because the Book of
[23:03] Revelations is being unfolded daily all
[23:07] these things that are happening in the
[23:08] Book of Revelations we're seeing it
[23:10] happen in the physical world we're
[23:12] living what John saw amen and remember
[23:15] what did John John top the entire bride
[23:18] so whatever he saw and done and was a
[23:22] part of it was what you're going through
[23:24] amen so the Lord bless you the Lord will
[23:28] perfect that which concerns me now mercy
[23:31] O Lord endureth forever for Satan not
[23:33] the works of thine own hand let's go to
[23:35] Psalms 85 1 turn this oh god of our
[23:38] salvation and cause that anger toward us
[23:40] to cease wilt thou be angry with us
[23:43] forever without draw out thine anger to
[23:46] all generations
[23:48] wilt thou not revive us again that thy
[23:51] people may rejoice indeed you may be
[23:55] seated in the Lord that is blessing to
[23:58] the reading of the word now let's read
[24:01] this first quote because it's the same
[24:05] prayer we've been reading but I believe
[24:07] it's just full of all kind of vitamins
[24:09] it's full of all kind of things that you
[24:12] and I need and if we'll just do what
[24:15] this one paragraph says do what this one
[24:19] paragraph says you'll be a lot better
[24:22] off amen and I hope it's creating a
[24:25] revival I hope some and it's going to be
[24:27] remember it's going to be a piecemeal
[24:29] revival it's going to be a word
[24:32] revival but it's going to what if
[24:33] something's gonna spark in your heart
[24:35] because I can't bring it
[24:37] see that's why if you'll understand what
[24:39] brother Devils been saying he said I've
[24:40] been in a revival for 50 years but
[24:43] remember according to the Prophet and
[24:45] according to the Bible a preacher can't
[24:47] bring the revival so he's been waiting
[24:51] all night just as God's waiting on us
[24:54] our pastors been waiting on us to start
[24:58] a revival not a whooping and hollering
[25:02] like we're gonna say in in a minute but
[25:03] but a word revival what do what the word
[25:06] says it's really easy but it's very hard
[25:09] to do what the word says God created me
[25:14] a revival let me be the revival let each
[25:19] one of us be the revival the revival in
[25:23] me make me Lord to hunger make me to
[25:28] thirst created me Lord that which is
[25:31] needed in me let me from this hour on be
[25:36] thine more consecrated servant a better
[25:39] servant more blessed of you more able
[25:42] more humbler more kinder more willing to
[25:46] work more looking to the things that are
[25:48] positive and forgiving the things that
[25:51] are in the past and the negatives let me
[25:55] press toward the mark of high calling of
[25:57] Christ amen so I believe that just as
[26:03] just as a sunday-school teacher and also
[26:06] just as a song leader they said an
[26:11] atmosphere they set a place for you to
[26:15] get under or get in so that you can hear
[26:18] from God all right
[26:21] then the minister has a lot less tough
[26:24] time bringing this message if everybody
[26:28] does their job down the line and then
[26:30] and it starts number one with and I want
[26:33] to tell you a revival enough in me is
[26:35] for sister Monica to come up to me this
[26:37] morning and say everybody showed up on
[26:39] time
[26:42] yeah hey hey do this and go really
[26:52] that's a change in anything anybody
[26:55] thinking oh yeah that's a change that
[26:57] you've made that's something you've
[27:01] decided to do you know why you decided
[27:04] cuz the door's locked
[27:07] that's an ultimatum but you know what
[27:11] sometimes God does know that right here
[27:12] says look in the first though I walk in
[27:15] the midst of trouble that will revive me
[27:16] thou it stretch forth thine hand the
[27:18] Lord will perfect that which concerning
[27:20] me thy mercy O Lord endureth forever for
[27:22] Satan up the works of thine own hand and
[27:24] you and I are the work of God's hands
[27:26] he's been waiting on us
[27:28] and I'll steal that quote from brother
[27:31] Dale he's been waiting on us
[27:32] adoption time work with God he's waiting
[27:34] on me in you you said no wait a minute
[27:36] well go back to brother Chris long
[27:40] sermon about the conflict between God
[27:43] and Satan there is no conflict how can
[27:47] you be in conflict with a creator
[27:50] there is no opponent but the only thing
[27:55] is is you standing in the middle you're
[27:58] the battleground he's already beat the
[28:01] devil according to the Bible he's
[28:03] already beat the devil amen
[28:05] and he's who is he's Victor he's he's
[28:10] never lost he's never lost the battle
[28:13] so here you are standing in the middle
[28:15] the greatest balance ever fought the
[28:17] conflict between God and Satan amen
[28:21] you ever thought about that you're the
[28:23] conflict you're the one holding this
[28:25] thing up you do this you're the one
[28:30] that's holding it up amen
[28:33] we like to blame Aaron we like to bring
[28:35] this for another let's blame herself but
[28:40] it will do what the word says it will it
[28:43] will it will have to cause a revival you
[28:47] can't sit still as what we're going to
[28:49] talk about today getting under a Holy
[28:51] Ghost atmosphere to where the word can
[28:54] because the Holy Ghost was given so the
[28:56] full word can work okay everybody got
[29:01] that
[29:01] I didn't bring water out here let's get
[29:04] me some water I'm 60 years old remember

[29:45] we all feel that way so let's read now
[29:51] coke number two we'll get started here
[29:54] man that clock is pretty precise oh wait
[29:58] a minute
[29:58] Anderson that's an atomic clock okay I
[30:06] hope it doesn't go off maybe you'll
[30:11] create a little radiation in here and
[30:14] when you see these crowds gathering that
[30:17] doesn't mean we're Bible now we've been
[30:18] through that by just what that's just a
[30:20] gathering but a revival is when the
[30:22] people get really right with God and
[30:25] that's what we're gonna talk about today
[30:26] a Holy Ghost atmosphere will get you
[30:29] right with God no question that's what
[30:34] it was sent for was to get us in
[30:37] condition to hear from God and pray
[30:41] through and starts a revival throughout
[30:44] the city and everything you see they put
[30:46] away Sam put away their iniquity turn to
[30:48] God turn around and start back again
[30:50] in other words start down the road all
[30:51] right let's read number three we realize
[30:57] there's no new doctrine that we got to
[30:59] come up with listen this is a word
[31:00] revival of the word that is eternal
[31:03] that's always been there always been
[31:07] there
[31:08] the words always been there so always
[31:09] had power alright but brother I feel
[31:12] good about it anyway what this church
[31:15] needs today is a good revival not a new
[31:17] doctrine a new order just a stirring up
[31:20] of what you already know about all right
[31:25] so what was the Holy Ghost will read it
[31:27] in a few minutes what was it given for
[31:28] lead you and guide you into all truth
[31:32] and to what teach you things to come
[31:37] teach it's a teacher all right so we'll
[31:40] see that in just a minute so we're not
[31:42] looking for a new doctrine we're not
[31:43] looking for some we've had three or four
[31:46] different preachers coming here and just
[31:48] write on the same line of what of what's
[31:50] already been here so the reason you
[31:52] cannot tell them brother Aaron the
[31:54] reason that that the Liberty is is here
[31:57] it's because the Liberty is out there
[32:00] there's no question mark there's no you
[32:03] know you can you don't even say well
[32:04] I've heard it before because we had
[32:06] everything brother Aaron the priest we'd
[32:07] we'd all preached on Genesis one all the
[32:11] different things but it was a different
[32:12] angle that God came through to maybe
[32:14] helped you more not a different doctrine
[32:18] the same doctrine brought in a little
[32:20] different Avenue there's many ways to
[32:22] get to New York right but you all but
[32:25] you get to New York so there's many ways
[32:27] to bring the message to let to help you
[32:31] know it may help Susan one day and it
[32:33] may help brother Bob the different ones
[32:35] we can't be so narrow-minded that that
[32:38] you only listen to us because it gets a
[32:42] little mundane sometimes that's why you
[32:44] have a fivefold ministry five different
[32:46] things to be brought in and five
[32:48] different ways to get to New York but
[32:50] it's still getting in New York there was
[32:53] no false brought in there so and if
[32:54] there was you could quickly realize it
[32:56] like brother Dale said this point you
[32:58] could quickly realize it why because the
[33:00] Holy Ghost only feeds on the pure
[33:03] unadulterated I'm getting a little head
[33:05] of my sermon unadulterated Word of God
[33:07] he can't feed off of negativism he can't
[33:10] feed off a false doctrine there's no way
[33:14] God can feed off of off dr.
[33:19] that's just the way it is the Holy Ghost
[33:22] is pure and true all right now let's
[33:25] read number four now Minister cannot
[33:27] bring a revival
[33:28] there's no preacher can bring a revival
[33:29] mmm he doesn't pack it with him and the
[33:32] only thing you can do is just be loyal
[33:33] to God and His Word and the revival has
[33:36] to come by the people in your home in
[33:38] your life now revival isn't adding new
[33:40] members to the church is reviving that
[33:42] what we've already got to revive means
[33:45] to bring back or let me say to bring
[33:48] things back to your memory that you've
[33:51] locked inside of your brain I'm sure
[33:53] that that when the Holy Ghost fell on
[33:56] the day of Pentecost there was Peter
[33:58] James and John and then heard for three
[34:01] and a half years what Jesus had said and
[34:03] all of a sudden it was just like
[34:06] fireworks going off well that's why he
[34:08] said that well that's why he said that
[34:10] well that's why the scripture says that
[34:12] well that's why Jesus had to come it
[34:14] just kept firing off that's the way it's
[34:16] supposed to be when the Holy Ghost comes
[34:18] it falls on it can't fall on it can fall
[34:23] on ground but that grounds gotta have a
[34:25] seed in it to bring forth something you
[34:29] got to have a seed planted in the ground
[34:30] so we got to have the word planted
[34:33] that's why I believe it's just my sauce
[34:37] everybody's looking for the last seed
[34:39] the last one and they're going out to
[34:40] the highways and hedges I believe we
[34:42] ought to get everybody born again in the
[34:44] building first we get everybody born
[34:47] again in the building first then we
[34:50] might can go look for the last seed but
[34:52] the last seed could be sitting here for
[34:53] 10 15 20 years under sanctification and
[34:57] finally somebody preached a sermon and
[35:00] it quick and what they've got inside
[35:02] that's why that levinthal worker got the
[35:05] same amount cuz he had it Pat he had to
[35:07] pack in one hour he had to learn in one
[35:10] hour what it took them 10 hours to learn
[35:13] the rest of the time all right
[35:15] their training was really fast hey bye
[35:21] all right say Amen all right number five
[35:24] testimony on the seat then we begin to
[35:27] find out miracles isn't taking place in
[35:29] the more like we they were
[35:30] the Citgo homesick it isn't because of
[35:33] God it's because of the lack of the
[35:36] revival among the people there is no
[35:39] revival they sit and listen go home and
[35:41] say well I guess that was pretty good
[35:43] mm-hmm
[35:43] see there's not that zeal now we looked
[35:46] up that word and that word means fervor
[35:49] our passion we've lost maybe the passion
[35:53] that we had before of remember when you
[35:56] everybody remember when you first got
[35:57] born again I don't care how old you are
[36:00] listen we're human but when you were
[36:04] born the first time you were born again
[36:05] when you were born again you couldn't
[36:08] wait for the doors to open to get in
[36:09] church you wanted to put on a tape every
[36:12] time there was a gap in your time you
[36:15] wanted to read a book well now we've
[36:17] come 20 30 years down the road where's
[36:23] the fervor where's the passion I promise
[36:28] you the Holy Ghost will not go backwards
[36:31] can't go backwards because remember
[36:34] you're for combat beasts in Ezekiel and
[36:36] all those different ones the Bible says
[36:37] they never went backwards they always
[36:39] went forward all right so that's the way
[36:41] with you and I if we don't keep good we
[36:43] got to keep going forward but we got to
[36:45] realize we're maybe in a stalemate we
[36:48] got to realize we're maybe in a the old
[36:51] world word for it is in them and just a
[36:53] mess kind of a foggy you know how you
[36:58] get kind of foggy sometimes you know you
[37:00] work all day and you do all kind of oh
[37:01] your sisters doing you take care of the
[37:03] kids and yadda yadda yadda all these
[37:05] different things and sometimes you just
[37:06] get a little fog
[37:07] well why you're burdened with all the
[37:09] things of the world you know just step
[37:11] out some time and say God thank you for
[37:12] letting me be alive thank you for
[37:15] letting me live thank you for letting me
[37:16] take care of my husband thank you ever
[37:17] let me take you the kids and thank you
[37:19] God for saving my soul I have to do that
[37:24] I have to say thank you God for saving
[37:26] my soul you say why it's reminding God
[37:29] note reminded me of what he's done for
[37:32] me all right because we do get that
[37:34] brother brad says we get that weight of
[37:36] the world the Bible tells us we get the
[37:38] weight of the world on us and and we get
[37:40] all the different things that and you
[37:42] know what though we're pressurized for
[37:43] it we can take
[37:44] we're supposed to be able to take it
[37:48] alright number six we will see Jesus
[37:51] that enthusiasm the church today lost
[37:55] this enthusiasm why because this got out
[37:58] of the vine and it's no more energy
[38:02] being energized by the spirit that's
[38:04] what we're going to talk about a Holy
[38:05] Ghost atmosphere or an energizing wells
[38:08] of water bubbling up into everlasting
[38:09] life they've lost that zeal something's
[38:13] missing God remains the same Christ
[38:16] remains the same but his church has
[38:18] disassociated itself with his connection
[38:21] divine the spirit let me bring a little
[38:23] something to you real quick when you
[38:25] have a plant when you have a peach or
[38:29] pear or pecan or well anything that
[38:32] produces fruit the ultimate goal of that
[38:36] whole plant is to make sure that fruit
[38:39] comes to maturity okay
[38:43] and even in stunting the growth of the
[38:46] tree hear what I'm saying every bit of
[38:53] the life is pushed out to that outside
[38:56] limb where that fruit is because if that
[38:59] fruit doesn't mature there's nothing
[39:01] left for the next generation all right
[39:05] cuz they tell you and you know from
[39:07] being a beekeeper and all these
[39:08] different things you you see these you
[39:10] see a field of clover and you see all
[39:12] this white out there well that's good
[39:14] but the plant is stunted because it has
[39:17] put every bit of its energy into their
[39:19] doing making the seed so if you'll go
[39:22] out there and just cut it down for about
[39:23] two weeks two weeks from that you'll get
[39:27] triple a crop because you've given time
[39:29] to get the roots settle back again to
[39:31] get the to get to leave settle back
[39:33] again and then they'll pop up with some
[39:35] more fruits honey that's what God's been
[39:36] doing through the church ages he's we've
[39:39] had people come to fruition in each
[39:41] church age but not full fruition they
[39:43] had to be cut down or put into the grave
[39:46] because the full fruit is for this hour
[39:49] this is the hour that the bride tree is
[39:52] to produce fruit that will go up like I
[39:56] said and not draw
[39:57] down on the ground and rot and why how
[40:03] by listing you at by this atmosphere I
[40:06] don't I want to say new it's not a new
[40:08] atmosphere started on dead Pentecost but
[40:12] they didn't have enough word there
[40:13] wasn't enough word that's why this word
[40:15] revival has to come to a place of full
[40:17] fruition full word every word not part
[40:21] word not your idea or my idea it's got
[40:25] to be the full word just like it was
[40:28] when Jesus spoke it you see it can't
[40:29] happen I'll read you a quote in just a
[40:30] minute it's gonna have to happen I told
[40:34] you before Jesus never had a problem
[40:36] with his father Jesus never walked out
[40:40] one day in the synagogue and said when
[40:42] I'm in me and Daddy were fighting in the
[40:44] back and I was gonna tell y'all
[40:47] something else and he told me to tell
[40:49] you all this I don't believe it but I'm
[40:51] gonna tell you anyway now that becomes
[40:52] sorry wouldn't it I wouldn't want to
[40:54] serve a god like that
[40:55] I want a God that when Jesus said I only
[40:58] do that what the father shows me in
[41:01] other words what the father spoke he
[41:03] spoke and it was straight from the
[41:05] eternal that's your and mine that's our
[41:11] mandate for this in time right if we're
[41:14] gonna be as brother Dale said if the
[41:16] bride is going to be the son of man in
[41:19] the end time we have got to speak the
[41:22] same thing he spoke with no error you
[41:27] sure you can't keep it together no we
[41:29] can't but God can we just haven't
[41:32] yielded ourselves to him as much as we
[41:35] should let's go to joel 2:23 this is
[41:36] where we were talking about liens day
[41:39] night for those of you that weren't here
[41:45] right where we were gonna start speaking
[41:48] brother Branham was already in the
[41:50] spoken words original seed and he was
[41:52] reading he was actually quoting the
[41:54] quote before before I got out here so it
[41:56] was kind of easy Wednesday night so
[41:58] we're gonna go back to it just for a
[41:59] second read Joel 2:23 be glad then your
[42:04] children of Zion who's the children of
[42:05] Zion
[42:07] who's the children of line you and I
[42:10] we're
[42:11] the children the daughters of thine and
[42:13] rejoice in the Lord your God for have
[42:15] given you the former rain moderately not
[42:18] what is to form a rain it's mo WR eh or
[42:22] teaching rain now brother Browne said
[42:26] and I'll read it to you just a minute
[42:27] where rain means revival so let's read
[42:30] it like this and he shall give you the
[42:32] former revival moderately and he will
[42:37] cause to come down for you the revival
[42:40] may be revival comes from heaven down to
[42:42] here the former revival and the latter
[42:46] revival in the first month that's gonna
[42:48] happen real quick cuz that's right here
[42:49] at the end time God said two thousand
[42:52] years to get a bride ready but he's only
[42:54] got a short period of time in this life
[42:55] stage brother Browne said it was the
[42:57] shortest age but we've got to get the
[43:01] most word we got to get two thousand
[43:04] years plus we've got to get what they
[43:07] had in Ephesians eight but brother Brian
[43:11] said this message amount come forward
[43:12] there's two things not only restores
[43:14] back to that but give us something that
[43:16] no one has ever got before as I said
[43:18] last Wednesday night we hate to be
[43:20] exclusive but God has made us exclusive
[43:23] listen I don't hate only having one
[43:25] bride I love having only one bride I
[43:29] don't know what these people do with
[43:31] least three and four and five brides
[43:34] natural so God's not gonna have them
[43:37] spiritually he's gonna have one bride
[43:39] bride's brides churches brides but
[43:41] they'll come one all the other brides
[43:44] they're waiting on us to bring this
[43:49] thing to fruition with this last I
[43:52] believe that's last revival because
[43:54] there is no other revival the only other
[43:56] revival that this world is ever gonna
[43:58] get is when we're not here two witnesses
[44:03] they're gonna get a revival like you
[44:06] wouldn't believe
[44:07] but it's not to us not for us but it
[44:11] will be caused because it will be
[44:13] because we have left and we have already
[44:17] had our individual revival and our
[44:20] revival takes us up and takes us out
[44:23] into another two
[44:24] mentioned so that God can go to work
[44:25] with Israel and boy will they have a
[44:27] revival amen
[44:30] so more rain is teaching rain are
[44:33] teaching to maturity he will cause to
[44:35] come down for you the rain the former
[44:36] rain the latter rain in the first month
[44:38] the floor shall be full of wheat and the
[44:41] fast shall overflow with what wine and
[44:44] oil what does that represent
[44:45] the holy goat all right and I will
[44:48] restore so there was a falling away
[44:51] there was a seed had to go into the
[44:54] ground we know that by the Bible even in
[44:57] the dark ages they're handing one go in
[44:59] the ground of a group of people going to
[45:01] ground so that Luther and Wesley and
[45:03] Pentecost could come back up is that
[45:04] right but remember they didn't have
[45:07] fruit oh they had fruits of the spirit
[45:11] but they weren't the full mature grain
[45:14] God wasn't looking at the Pentecostal
[45:16] Church and say there's my wheat there's
[45:19] my seed no that was shuck
[45:21] that was protecting what was growing on
[45:24] the inside that's why brother Branham
[45:27] says when the bride begins to say the
[45:30] bride the true seed word begins to say I
[45:34] and my father are just like that seed I
[45:37] only say what the father tells me to say
[45:39] the shuck which is already dead to life
[45:43] going out of it the shucks gonna pull
[45:45] away and you see that happening now
[45:47] that's not Pentecost now brother rap
[45:49] called the Pentecostal show and we can
[45:51] say that as a doctrinal wise it is
[45:53] Pentecost has been pulled away doctrine
[45:58] penticoff we're speaking in tongues and
[46:00] all these other things or you got to
[46:01] come to my church you got to believe my
[46:03] doctrine that's just as Pentecostal as
[46:04] it was when somebody stood in 40 years
[46:07] ago and said you got speaking tongues
[46:09] out of the Holy Ghost that same devil
[46:10] standing behind a pulpit saying if you
[46:12] don't come to this church you don't
[46:13] listen to my message if you don't
[46:15] believe when I'm preached that's the
[46:16] same devil same devil listen I'm not
[46:22] trying to narrow this thing down God is
[46:24] narrowing it down that thing gets more
[46:27] narrow as we get to the headship it's
[46:31] only for a certain group and they all
[46:35] got to be alive it can't be dead
[46:40] the floor shall be full of wheat in the
[46:42] fat shall overflow wine oil and I will
[46:45] restore to who you he's still talking
[46:48] about the children of thine I will
[46:51] restore to you the years the two
[46:54] thousand years go to the seals folks go
[46:59] to the seals and put this in the seals
[47:01] the four horse riders locus cankerworm
[47:07] pommel worm caterpillar four horsemen
[47:11] they eat the word down the false vine
[47:16] but thank God he's given us a promise I
[47:20] will restore it to you so he's not gonna
[47:23] restore the world
[47:24] he's not gonna restore the
[47:26] denomination's how you can't they have
[47:28] no foundation
[47:31] they have no foundation to restore from
[47:34] what this foundation was a pure Holy
[47:37] Ghost atmosphere foundation for God to
[47:40] stack all the promises on top of it
[47:46] there's a standard been raised and we'll
[47:50] read in just a second and you shall eat
[47:53] implanting listen guys we got a seven
[47:58] course meal
[48:00] it's the books open John didn't pick and
[48:04] choose a salad and his dessert in
[48:07] Revelation is 10 to eat the whole book
[48:10] he didn't leave any of it laying down on
[48:12] the ground heat the whole thing you
[48:14] disappeared were to disappear in John so
[48:18] where's the book today by the baptism of
[48:21] Holy Ghost system it's disappeared in
[48:23] you so what you do you eat the word and
[48:27] brother Brown said the Holy Ghost inside
[48:30] of you is waiting for you to bring the
[48:33] word faith doesn't come by eating it
[48:38] comes by hearing so you got to hear it
[48:40] this is where it's got to go first it's
[48:42] got to be what faith cometh by hearing
[48:44] but then what do we do we eat it we eat
[48:48] the book we might have to do like the
[48:50] cows do you what
[48:51] go cows out in Terrance's pasture you
[48:53] know they'll they'll walk around and
[48:55] they'll eat for two hours and never
[48:57] raise her head then they'll go over and
[48:59] lay down somewhere they'll go what
[49:04] they're bringing it back up and eating
[49:07] it again
[49:08] that's called a room and airy they have
[49:10] 5 stomachs if you want to know what all
[49:12] that is they keep it there and that's
[49:15] what you know that's what we're doing we
[49:17] keep it in there and then when a
[49:19] preacher comes like brother Aaron or
[49:20] brother Dale and different ones that
[49:22] preach here what do they do they bring
[49:24] back to your remembrance what you've
[49:28] already heard and then what do you do
[49:32] you chew on it a little bit more and
[49:35] then it becomes part of you but thank
[49:37] God for that
[49:38] Isaiah 59 19 let's move on so shall they
[49:43] fear the name of the Lord from the West
[49:45] and its glory from the rising of the Sun
[49:47] when the enemy shall come in like a
[49:49] flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift
[49:51] up or revive a standard against him a
[49:56] standard away an atmosphere it's already
[49:59] there how do you fight water with water
[50:04] fight water with water it's like I said
[50:09] before Jesus told us it if you if you
[50:12] were the light you can't be put out what
[50:17] puts you out is is you're not the light
[50:19] and you look at it and it blinds you but
[50:22] we can't be blinded the bride type of
[50:26] the moon but thank God he put it in the
[50:28] Bible this supernatural happening that
[50:31] the Moon is going to be seven times
[50:33] brighter moon is who the bride we're
[50:38] gonna be seven times higher hotter
[50:41] brighter in this age because the Bible
[50:47] tells us the Bible says if that lighting
[50:49] you be darkness
[50:51] you think it's light those people think
[50:54] it's like maybe some people sitting in
[50:56] here think you've got all the light in
[50:57] the world and if you think it's light
[51:00] and it's not it's the greatest darkness
[51:04] that will ever be
[51:05] is to walk in like brother Brown said
[51:07] about being blind rich and miserable and
[51:09] naked but the board and I were talking
[51:11] like this a few minutes ago they that's
[51:13] the denominational people they were so
[51:14] blinded they have zero clothes on the
[51:18] program said that's insanity if you see
[51:20] somebody with no clothes on walking down
[51:21] the street blind wretched and miserable
[51:23] naked and don't know it now to know it
[51:26] is different but to not know it and
[51:29] think you're fully clothed well I'm
[51:33] going in because I'm a Baptist you're
[51:36] naked you have nothing to cover you with
[51:41] that's horrible but thank God he give us
[51:45] a standard he gave us a standard to go
[51:49] by and we can always go by it will never
[51:52] change it's not this way in this time in
[51:56] this way no no it's always been the Word
[51:58] of God
[51:59] alright let's read right here in Hosea
[52:04] come let us return unto the Lord for he
[52:07] hath torn and he will heal us he has
[52:09] smitten and he will bind us up after two
[52:12] days will he revive us now there's you
[52:16] promise in the third day he will raise
[52:19] us up and we shall live in his sight
[52:22] then shall we know if we follow on to
[52:26] know the Lord and his going forth is
[52:28] prepared as the morning and he shall
[52:30] come unto us as the rain or as the
[52:32] revival as the latter and former revival
[52:35] unto the earth so now we've had the
[52:37] teaching rain we've been under this
[52:39] teaching rain for all this time
[52:40] now the latter rain is didn't falling
[52:44] brother branham's time he told him it
[52:46] wasn't going to fall he told them
[52:48] nonsense you haven't had the former yet
[52:53] but we're living folks we're not living
[52:56] now sure there is a former rain as far
[52:59] as your teaching but we got it there's
[53:01] gonna be a time when it's got to come to
[53:02] me that fruit right here not to not the
[53:05] bark not to leave not to not the SAP not
[53:07] it it's got to be that fruit that
[53:10] original fruit that made the tree I mean
[53:17] look you can graph the
[53:18] our engine an apple or an orange and a
[53:20] lemon tree and it'll grow but you can't
[53:24] take that orange seed plant it right
[53:28] there were and think you're gonna get
[53:30] lemons you're not you're gonna get
[53:32] oranges cuz it's the life is what's in
[53:35] the tree we've got to get back to the
[53:37] original life
[53:38] the original life its original seed the
[53:44] original word is what I believe stand up
[53:48] on your feet we're gonna sing that song
[53:52] the original live the original scene the
[53:58] original word hey y'all made it thirty
[54:01] minutes what I believe the son of mine
[54:05] is reveal the Seventh Seal is unveil the
[54:10] original I the original see for some
[54:14] yellow just woke up the original the
[54:18] original see the original words don't be
[54:22] fun it's what I believe the Son of Man
[54:27] is revealed the Seventh Seal isn't them
[54:31] the original the original seen you can
[54:36] be seated that wasn't in my notes after
[54:39] two days after thirty minutes we're
[54:43] gonna revive again better now yeah all
[54:50] right let's read number seven broken
[54:51] cistern it don't need no filter no
[54:55] strainer no pumping no jerking no
[54:57] nothing's talked about that little that
[55:00] little bubbling brook that he came upon
[55:02] there in the woods
[55:03] it's just dire bubbling up it don't have
[55:06] to depend on local rains to fill it up
[55:09] rains or revivals where that fountain
[55:12] that's at that fountain of life where
[55:15] the carcass is the Eagles will gather we
[55:18] don't have to pump up a revival you
[55:20] don't have to pump up nothing only thing
[55:24] you have to do is just come to it it's
[55:28] always full of good fresh water and
[55:31] there is no end
[55:32] to it it just keeps on bubbling number
[55:35] eight that's the way you get a
[55:37] revivalist when you really get in the
[55:39] spirit of revival now we're talking
[55:41] about going to get an atmosphere we're
[55:43] talking about getting in the spirit of
[55:44] something all right people get in the
[55:47] spirit of different things road rage is
[55:50] one ball games and all these different
[55:54] things they get there's a spirit
[55:55] involved with that all right so we're
[55:57] gonna get in the spirit of revival Lord
[55:59] bring back to my memory what I've
[56:01] already heard and then teach me things
[56:04] to come
[56:05] then help me Lord how many times you
[56:07] listen here's a real good teaching
[56:10] moment if you're sitting there today or
[56:13] any other day and a preacher is up here
[56:16] preaching and you say I don't understand
[56:17] that have you ever stopped and just said
[56:20] lord I don't understand what that meant
[56:23] saying please
[56:25] somewhere reveal it to me he will have
[56:29] to do it don't go away and say I can't
[56:33] understand it in three days later say I
[56:35] can't understand it in ten days the Holy
[56:37] Ghost is not listening I'm not gonna say
[56:39] in this that the Holy Ghost is not dumb
[56:42] the Holy Ghost is extremely godly
[56:45] intelligent and if you have him inside
[56:48] of you he's got to do what he said he's
[56:53] got to bring you the truth not whooping
[56:57] it up or something but by praying it
[56:59] down where does water come from comes
[57:01] down where the revival come comes down
[57:03] on you until there's a revival start
[57:05] strikes your heart into all the logs of
[57:07] Ecclesiastes and blogs of families
[57:09] fanaticism all the logs of systems logs
[57:11] of unbelief flow out then the water of
[57:14] God comes falling down upon you there
[57:16] you are that's why the that's why they
[57:18] dream such a shepherd's dream what was
[57:20] it it was water water coming down into
[57:23] the box and what was coming out trash
[57:28] trash it was having a revival I'll
[57:34] guarantee you I'll promise you you'll
[57:36] have a revival if you'll start getting
[57:37] the trash out
[57:39] name whatever the tranche is doesn't
[57:42] matter just name it
[57:43] because we all got it my trash god picks
[57:48] up on Monday I tried to get him out on
[57:50] Sunday my trash that didn't go over well
[57:54] anyway my natural trash goes out on
[57:58] Monday I try to get my trash out on
[58:00] Sunday let me say it one more time I'm
[58:05] done but look that's the way you get a
[58:09] revival by praying it down the waters of
[58:12] God comes falling down upon you
[58:14] there you are listen it brother bored we
[58:17] were talking about baptism now we
[58:19] believe in water baptism not sprinkle
[58:24] aim because sprinkling may not hit a
[58:26] spot but me and brother Dale when we
[58:29] baptize you we try not to leave not one
[58:32] dry place on you because they might be a
[58:36] spot for the devil to get but when we
[58:39] put you in that icy water because I
[58:41] promise you if they bury you out here in
[58:43] the in a cemetery they're not gonna bury
[58:44] you with a hand sticking up they gonna
[58:47] make sure you six foot under we're gonna
[58:49] make sure that the old you is gone we
[58:52] have done what we what God told us to do
[58:55] now it's time for you to do what you're
[58:56] supposed to do but baptize if the water
[58:59] comes flowing down upon you there you
[59:02] are now look we're gonna go to number
[59:05] nine and I want to probably next Sunday
[59:10] still under I was gonna finish today we
[59:12] revival but something struck me
[59:13] yesterday once you start thinking about
[59:16] this now the power of God wake up the
[59:22] power of God will do this every five
[59:24] minutes we'll never get finished the
[59:28] power of God never changes it's just
[59:31] this constant it's more constant than
[59:33] anything it's constant the power of God
[59:36] is there and brother Graham said is to
[59:38] create a world and go live on it if you
[59:40] if you weren't what if it wasn't Harvard
[59:42] or bard in you you could create a world
[59:46] and go live one cut why cut the Creator
[59:48] the one who stood one day and said let
[59:49] there be
[59:50] he's inside of you if you're born again
[59:52] all right but something had to change
[59:58] the power didn't change the Holy Ghost
[1:00:01] didn't change nobody got that same em so
[1:00:06] there had to be somewhere a transfer of
[1:00:09] power we're gonna speak on that maybe
[1:00:12] next Sunday because there had to be a
[1:00:15] transfer cause remember this man that
[1:00:18] what brother Aaron was talking about and
[1:00:20] what in the beginning there's this
[1:00:22] all-powerful all-knowing all-seeing
[1:00:26] eternal being standing where there's
[1:00:29] nothing and when he says let there be
[1:00:32] this thing we're standing on is created
[1:00:36] what a power but he didn't want to keep
[1:00:41] it he did not want to keep that power if
[1:00:45] you kept that power he'd be hello him
[1:00:47] he'd be self-existing which he still was
[1:00:49] but he's not stuff existing anymore why
[1:00:51] he chose not to be you believe God makes
[1:00:55] choices I do brother Brown said he had a
[1:00:58] plan and a purpose
[1:00:59] he chose a plan and guess why it's
[1:01:03] perfect it's a perfect plan this
[1:01:07] couldn't happen no other way that's why
[1:01:11] I rest on whether I look at things and I
[1:01:14] go what in the world God made it this
[1:01:16] way we just have to attach ourselves to
[1:01:19] that plan all right everybody got that
[1:01:23] so there's a transfer but we'll talk
[1:01:25] about that in the Sunday but watch what
[1:01:27] happens during the time I read this look
[1:01:29] at verse looking up verse 9 look at the
[1:01:31] quote number nine on the third seal now
[1:01:34] that's the reason today because remember
[1:01:36] we went when we first started this we
[1:01:38] went through revivals this one had a
[1:01:40] revival Wesley luther Sankey Calvin
[1:01:43] Finney all those had revivals and there
[1:01:46] was a cycle of that revival and it was
[1:01:48] good for the time it was good for the
[1:01:52] time but it wasn't the full mature fruit
[1:01:56] time it was the Holy Ghost to do it but
[1:02:00] something had it funneled down or
[1:02:03] narrowed
[1:02:03] and what was that man's ideas but we'll
[1:02:05] look at that in just a second the right
[1:02:08] now what's the reason today that the
[1:02:12] revivals that were supposed to have that
[1:02:18] we're supposed to have
[1:02:19] we have denominational revivals we
[1:02:21] haven't had a real stirring Lord that's
[1:02:24] 1963 that's been the seal is open he's
[1:02:27] been through the greatest campaign of
[1:02:29] healing that ever struck the face of the
[1:02:30] earth and he said we're in the wrong
[1:02:33] revival that's reason they the revivals
[1:02:37] that were supposed to have dot dot dot
[1:02:40] he stops we have because I believe he
[1:02:43] picked up their thought and he stuff
[1:02:44] well we've had denominational revivals
[1:02:46] we haven't had a real stirring no no no
[1:02:49] no no sir
[1:02:50] don't think we got revivals we haven't
[1:02:53] now why cuz it's 1963 the seals is broke
[1:02:56] he's moving over into another revival
[1:03:00] he's moving into that second phase of
[1:03:03] Malachi for that number one to restore
[1:03:06] the restores back to the faith of the
[1:03:08] fathers now he's moving into another
[1:03:10] revival bringing another not another
[1:03:13] word
[1:03:14] not another word not outside the Bible
[1:03:17] he's bringing lights on what's already
[1:03:19] there because we remember a revival it's
[1:03:22] not bringing a brand-new book per se
[1:03:25] words but a brand new way to look at it
[1:03:30] everybody got that same in so watch
[1:03:34] don't think we have revivals we haven't
[1:03:38] we have it all we got millions and
[1:03:40] millions of church members remember they
[1:03:42] come up with a slogan million more than
[1:03:43] 44 and all these different things but
[1:03:45] not a revival nowhere now look listen to
[1:03:48] me just a second they weren't they
[1:03:50] weren't revivals that didn't bring
[1:03:52] results they were people born again
[1:03:55] under those revivals mooney Sankey Feeny
[1:03:58] Calvin Hall there was people born again
[1:04:00] that were bribed but there were not what
[1:04:01] he's talking about not what he's talking
[1:04:05] about full fruition to the fruit aisle
[1:04:08] at the end of the out at the end of the
[1:04:10] branch but not a revival nowhere no no
[1:04:16] now if
[1:04:17] stopped it right there we'd be in
[1:04:18] trouble but he said the bride the bride
[1:04:23] hasn't had a revival yet remember in the
[1:04:26] in the sealed book he finally steps out
[1:04:29] one day and says I now call you bride he
[1:04:32] had separated the church from the bride
[1:04:34] because there is a difference the bride
[1:04:39] hasn't had a revival yet see there's
[1:04:41] been no revival there no manifestation
[1:04:44] of God to stir the bride yet see we're
[1:04:47] looking for it it will take those seven
[1:04:49] unknown thunders back there to wake her
[1:04:52] up again he will send it he promised it
[1:04:54] so whatever he promised right it's here
[1:04:57] whatever it is you want to think it's
[1:05:00] here he promised it something had to
[1:05:04] change there had to be a transfer of
[1:05:08] power from being it's okay me and
[1:05:12] brother but what was talking to men ago
[1:05:13] about God winking at the ignorance of
[1:05:16] men because the Holy Ghost never never
[1:05:21] developed a father son Holy Ghost
[1:05:24] baptism brother brems didn't come from
[1:05:27] the pits of hell Wow but God winked at
[1:05:32] the ignorance of man and let him do it
[1:05:35] down through the church ages and let him
[1:05:37] keep doing it Wesley was a Trinitarian
[1:05:39] baptized father son Holy Ghost he's a
[1:05:40] bride I told you a long time ago when we
[1:05:44] get to the new city there's only going
[1:05:47] to be a small microcosm of people that
[1:05:50] are born that were baptized the right
[1:05:52] way maybe the first two Church ages and
[1:05:56] half of the third and our age that's it
[1:06:00] everybody else is going to come under
[1:06:02] follow us and hold those why God winked
[1:06:04] at the ignorance of that way of baptism
[1:06:07] but he never the hot seat so look so the
[1:06:09] Holy Ghost couldn't work in that area I
[1:06:11] hope you get what I'm saying the Holy
[1:06:13] Ghost could not work in a false baptism
[1:06:15] but he went that the ignorance of man
[1:06:18] just enough to get them what in the
[1:06:21] bride tree but not the full fruit
[1:06:26] something had to change though from the
[1:06:30] administration of coming out to where
[1:06:33] Brenda Brown said I this our God through
[1:06:37] the Prophet said this it's what it is
[1:06:40] you don't baptize in the name of Father
[1:06:43] Son Holy Ghost no more that thing come
[1:06:45] from Hell that doctrine because it
[1:06:48] didn't come from God there's only two
[1:06:51] places there's only two powers really
[1:06:57] the devil don't have any God gives it to
[1:06:59] him power was given power was given
[1:07:03] power was given you know who gives you
[1:07:05] the power everybody take your hand raise
[1:07:07] it up cuz that's the person that gives
[1:07:09] it to him sadly to say but you know what
[1:07:13] we're coming into something though we're
[1:07:16] coming into something you say something
[1:07:18] different brother wait I don't like to
[1:07:19] use that word different but it is
[1:07:21] different than what people have seen
[1:07:22] before
[1:07:23] it is different than what a denomination
[1:07:25] it is even different for what people
[1:07:26] that come up in the first part of the
[1:07:28] message it is it's a transfer of power
[1:07:33] alright listen
[1:07:35] number 10 but that's the way God does he
[1:07:39] he humiliates us in our educational
[1:07:42] system not as I'm trying to support
[1:07:45] ignorance but I'm trying to tell you the
[1:07:47] difference education can never bring
[1:07:50] life it takes the Spirit of God to bring
[1:07:53] life and that life must not come out of
[1:07:56] just an intellectual revival it's got to
[1:08:00] come out of the Bible word revival and
[1:08:05] that word is the same yesterday today
[1:08:07] and forever and look when it falls falls
[1:08:10] rain when it falls the day and quickens
[1:08:16] you get the same results as you did in
[1:08:19] acts 2 it always has it always will be
[1:08:24] because it's the Spirit of God look that
[1:08:27] conditions the atmosphere Wow now
[1:08:33] atmosphere is all the way around the
[1:08:35] world
[1:08:38] I believe he's talking about your
[1:08:39] atmosphere the one you create the
[1:08:43] atmosphere you create brother brems did
[1:08:44] you create an atmosphere but let me ask
[1:08:47] you a question do you create a holy
[1:08:49] spirit atmosphere do we create a holy
[1:08:54] spirit atmosphere but it's got to come
[1:08:56] out of the Bible it's got um it's going
[1:08:58] to be a word revival that words the
[1:09:00] saint will not fail and when it falls or
[1:09:03] when it rains or when we get start this
[1:09:05] revival and it quickens what does it do
[1:09:09] let me just give me an example you look
[1:09:11] at yourself and going through your
[1:09:13] Christian this parish there's a lot of
[1:09:14] things that you didn't understand when
[1:09:16] you first got born again right but now
[1:09:18] you had the full Holy Ghost inside of
[1:09:19] you you didn't have just what while they
[1:09:23] got the know you got the Holy Ghost
[1:09:26] you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:29] you got God taking out the old nature
[1:09:32] putting his nature in and there you are
[1:09:37] cleans you up kills the old you not your
[1:09:42] soul not just soul or you're dead but he
[1:09:46] cleans it out listen in sanctification
[1:09:49] you ought to know what God does the
[1:09:51] unclean spirit goes out of a man but if
[1:09:53] you'll put the Holy Spirit in nothing
[1:09:55] else to get back in remember the one
[1:09:57] sealed up when you get pregnant sisters
[1:10:01] what happens you own cells up can't take
[1:10:03] anything else same way with God when God
[1:10:06] comes in and plants the seed word and it
[1:10:09] quickens and starts coming to life
[1:10:11] nothing else can get in that soul but
[1:10:14] it's that old spirit guy that we got to
[1:10:16] deal with and that's what we're dealing
[1:10:18] with now because we're we're not just
[1:10:20] now bringing our soul under a Holy
[1:10:23] Spirit atmosphere could it loves the
[1:10:26] word listen if you've got the baptismal
[1:10:30] though it is the word it's not a
[1:10:34] different word it is the word the same
[1:10:37] one that said let there be light
[1:10:40] it's now residing in your soul
[1:10:44] brother Brown says you and him in there
[1:10:48] as a person amen
[1:10:52] could you still got the outside got to
[1:10:54] deal with sorry we still got the outside
[1:10:58] got to deal with but we need to put it
[1:11:02] under a Holy Ghost atmosphere so that
[1:11:06] this revival because it's a word revival
[1:11:09] word has to compare with word all right
[1:11:12] everybody got that same man now listen
[1:11:15] now watch this right here
[1:11:16] pergamene church age number 11 how can
[1:11:20] you tell the spirits apart just give
[1:11:23] them the word test if they don't speak
[1:11:25] that word they are of the evil one whoa
[1:11:27] brother branham come on now I'm just
[1:11:30] telling you what he's there my brother
[1:11:33] Aaron said we need to separate ourselves
[1:11:35] from evil God told us to separate
[1:11:38] ourselves a total separation from
[1:11:42] unbelief all right as the evil one
[1:11:46] deceived the first two Brides he will
[1:11:49] try to deceive the bride of this last
[1:11:51] day by trying to get her to hybridize
[1:11:54] herself through Creed's are just plainly
[1:11:57] turning from the word to any sign that
[1:12:01] suits her everybody got that say ma'am
[1:12:05] watch this wake up listen but God never
[1:12:10] placed signs ahead of the word signs
[1:12:14] follow the word as when Elijah told the
[1:12:18] woman to bake him a cake first according
[1:12:22] to the word of the Lord
[1:12:23] when she did as the word said that's why
[1:12:28] sometimes we look around we wonder why
[1:12:30] God's not what not giving us signs well
[1:12:34] are we in the word when she did as the
[1:12:40] word said the proper son came huh come
[1:12:47] to the word first and then watch the
[1:12:52] miracle the seed word is energized by
[1:12:58] the spirit energized atmosphere is
[1:13:03] energized it you know you look at these
[1:13:05] places and you if you ever watch a go to
[1:13:09] a sporting event or something I'm I've
[1:13:11] been to a thumb and the most y'all have
[1:13:12] to but there's an energy there why they
[1:13:14] create an atmosphere they want to win
[1:13:18] and they'll rip their shirts off for 12
[1:13:20] degrees below zero and paint their
[1:13:22] favorite football team on their chest
[1:13:26] and we think they're crazy they're
[1:13:34] anointed they're energized by the spirit
[1:13:36] that's inside of them now I'm not
[1:13:39] advocating any of y'all doing that we
[1:13:42] can be civilized and still be energized
[1:13:46] okay but it would help every once in a
[1:13:49] while somebody go thank you lord thank
[1:13:53] you lord thank you lord thank you lord
[1:13:56] some of y'all ought to try that sometime
[1:13:59] the seed word is energized by the spirit
[1:14:03] I wrote myself a note this is where I
[1:14:05] take all energy in the plant it's put to
[1:14:09] getting the fruit out not to grow more
[1:14:12] no you prune limbs remember the Bible
[1:14:15] even tells the pruner goes in and prunes
[1:14:16] what dead limbs are the suckers that we
[1:14:19] have in our life because you won't every
[1:14:22] bit of that energy to go toward that
[1:14:25] apple or orange or whatever fruit that
[1:14:27] you're gonna listen I've learned this
[1:14:30] with the apple tree in the plum tree you
[1:14:32] can say oh man the more limbs the more
[1:14:35] the more the more that ain't right even
[1:14:39] the Bible tells you all right you got to
[1:14:41] go in and prune it if it proves that if
[1:14:45] you prune it it brings more fruit why
[1:14:47] the energy to make them limbs are cut
[1:14:51] off and then that energy is diverted to
[1:14:54] what make a bigger apple make a bigger
[1:14:56] fruit make a bigger whatever you got
[1:14:58] that same way with God
[1:14:59] we all got suckers in our life don't
[1:15:03] look over to your husband
[1:15:08] Susan did that's why I said that but if
[1:15:17] we get rid of the suckers listen the
[1:15:20] whole energy of God what he did from
[1:15:22] when he stood and said let there be
[1:15:24] light
[1:15:25] his whole intention was this hour right
[1:15:29] here
[1:15:29] if the Bible said that all prophets look
[1:15:33] to this day Jesus pointed to this day
[1:15:36] John pointed this day everything in the
[1:15:38] Bible is pointing to right now well
[1:15:41] where is his energy now the energy to
[1:15:44] produce this fruit is in every bit of
[1:15:46] you jesus said in John 14 I'll if you
[1:15:54] love me keep my Commandments and I will
[1:15:57] pray the Father and we're gonna have an
[1:15:59] argument no he said I will pray the
[1:16:02] father and he shall gladly give you
[1:16:05] another comforter that he may abide with
[1:16:09] you forever listen to this even the
[1:16:13] Spirit of Truth not error whom the world
[1:16:18] cannot receive see there's an exclusive
[1:16:23] right there we're an exclusive group of
[1:16:26] people whom the world cannot receive
[1:16:30] because it seeth him not or may I say
[1:16:33] understand this him not because we don't
[1:16:35] physically see Jesus we see men as
[1:16:38] people we see his works we see the
[1:16:40] things he does right that's why Jesus
[1:16:42] stood one day and said the world is
[1:16:43] gonna not gonna see me anymore but
[1:16:44] you'll see me cuz I'll be with you even
[1:16:49] in you to the end of the age all right
[1:16:52] whom the world cannot receive now that
[1:16:54] we got to have a Holy Ghost atmosphere
[1:16:56] because it says him not neither knoweth
[1:16:58] him in other words have an intimate
[1:17:01] relationship with him and bring all
[1:17:04] things to your remembrance there's you
[1:17:07] promise bring all things to your
[1:17:09] remembrance but the comforter that right
[1:17:15] you got it which is the whole it let's
[1:17:18] go back up to verse 17
[1:17:20] I mean verse 17 of John 14 I skipped
[1:17:22] that and sorry go back to there I'm not
[1:17:24] finished with that one even the Spirit
[1:17:26] of Truth you're fine
[1:17:27] whom the world cannot receive because it
[1:17:28] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[1:17:31] know him for he dwelleth with you and
[1:17:37] shall be in you
[1:17:41] how you gonna lose John 14 25 it a
[1:17:46] little bit further he keeps saying these
[1:17:47] things have I spoken unto you being yet
[1:17:49] present with you but the comforter which
[1:17:52] is the Holy Ghost whom the father will
[1:17:55] send in my name that's why that that
[1:18:02] quickened in Peters brain he said repent
[1:18:08] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:18:10] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:18:12] for you shall receive the gift of the
[1:18:15] Holy Ghost because it's in his name if
[1:18:20] we never get people to see the name
[1:18:23] father's not a name Sons on her name
[1:18:26] Holy Ghost is not a name it's a title to
[1:18:29] the name Jesus Christ our Lord
[1:18:34] we don't just baptize cold acts 2:38
[1:18:37] says - where'd that come from if you
[1:18:43] ever get a revelation of the name you'll
[1:18:45] have to get baptized in the name of the
[1:18:48] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:49] hey man whether it was in whether it was
[1:18:51] in there or not but he's plainly in
[1:18:53] there Peter said I've heard him say in
[1:18:56] John 14 of course it was written it's
[1:18:58] time but Peter says I heard him say whom
[1:19:01] the father will send in my name will
[1:19:03] then brothers and sisters we got to get
[1:19:05] baptized in that name and that's exactly
[1:19:09] what Jesus was saying he was saying
[1:19:11] something different he said baptized in
[1:19:14] my name what is the name of the Father
[1:19:17] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost the
[1:19:19] Lord Jesus Christ and bring all things
[1:19:22] to your remembrance whatsoever I have
[1:19:25] said unto you then that wasn't just a
[1:19:27] promise for the first church age to me
[1:19:31] old man the message since brother
[1:19:32] Branham was
[1:19:34] alive that's good you should have a lot
[1:19:40] of memory and this holy ghost person
[1:19:44] said he'll bring that all back to your
[1:19:45] memory you say I have a hard problem
[1:19:50] with that brother way check up time
[1:19:55] maybe you don't have the whole go and
[1:19:59] like brother Dale said if you if you
[1:20:00] decide or realize you don't have it
[1:20:03] you're sitting in a good place to get it
[1:20:05] cuz I just told you the promise repent
[1:20:09] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:20:11] Christ with the mission says and you
[1:20:13] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:15] for what this promise that's the promise
[1:20:17] brother Dale was online this morning
[1:20:19] that's in the Bible they didn't receive
[1:20:21] the promise what is the promise the
[1:20:23] promise is unto you the promise of
[1:20:25] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:28] the Greek lexicon watch what it says
[1:20:30] right here about the comforter will be
[1:20:35] finished right here real quick I may not
[1:20:37] get them all but we'll get the rest of
[1:20:38] it next Sunday Parakletos are an
[1:20:45] advocate one who pleads and others calls
[1:20:48] before a judge a Pleader counsel for the
[1:20:51] defense legal assistant an advocate one
[1:20:55] who pleads another's cause you know it
[1:20:56] was wonderful that God sent us a prophet
[1:20:58] to tell us that Jesus is the is the
[1:21:01] defense lawyer he's the attorney he's
[1:21:04] the judge he's the Advocate
[1:21:06] he's the jury how can you lose how can
[1:21:10] you lose it's good to know somebody
[1:21:17] walked into place myself with my young
[1:21:22] son standing back yonder sitting back
[1:21:24] under and it was good to have all Jerry
[1:21:26] Riley standing right there with her
[1:21:28] because you know what daddy saved his
[1:21:29] life when he was located from drowning
[1:21:31] and he was a solicitor general the whole
[1:21:33] county and I felt pretty good I had some
[1:21:37] prestige beside me but what about the
[1:21:40] King of glory inside of you not beside
[1:21:42] you that man's inside of you that
[1:21:45] advocate is inside the
[1:21:48] one who pleads and others cause with one
[1:21:51] an intercessor so if Christ in is the
[1:21:53] exaltation to God's right hand pleading
[1:21:56] with God the Father for the pardon of
[1:21:58] our sins now watch this one in the
[1:22:01] widest sense the helper
[1:22:02] Itzik or an aider an assistant so if the
[1:22:07] Holy Spirit destined to take the place
[1:22:09] of Christ with the Apostles and he was
[1:22:11] because Jesus said I'll go away and I'm
[1:22:13] gonna send you a comforter I'm going
[1:22:15] away in my body for I'm going away but
[1:22:17] I'm coming back I'm not gonna leave you
[1:22:19] comfortless I'm not gonna leave you
[1:22:20] alone I'm gonna send you some help I
[1:22:23] like what this says here after his
[1:22:26] ascension to the Father to lead them who
[1:22:28] the Apostles so if the whole show of the
[1:22:32] Holy Spirit destined to take the place
[1:22:33] of Christ with the Apostles to lead them
[1:22:36] to a deeper knowledge of the gospel
[1:22:38] truth and give them divine strength
[1:22:43] needed to enable them to undergo trials
[1:22:46] and persecutions on behalf of the divine
[1:22:49] kingdom that's what you and I have to
[1:22:51] have the Holy Ghost every day to
[1:22:53] overcome every day every day but being a
[1:23:01] full word revival what's this John 16
[1:23:08] Saint John 16 verse 12 I have yet many
[1:23:12] things to say unto you but you can't
[1:23:14] bear them now what you can't bear them
[1:23:17] now I got a lot to say to you but I'm
[1:23:20] gonna just wait and I'm gonna tell them
[1:23:22] in a different way I'm not gonna be here
[1:23:25] anymore but I'm gonna send somebody
[1:23:27] that's going to reside in you and then
[1:23:30] if you start when you start hearing
[1:23:32] hearing the Word of God it's going to
[1:23:35] quicken what you have howbeit when he
[1:23:39] the spirit of truth is come he will
[1:23:44] guide you into all truth there has never
[1:23:49] been a false doctrine come from God
[1:23:52] never have been a false doctrine come
[1:23:56] from God it's always come from the devil
[1:23:59] God
[1:24:00] Kame bring the fox doctor he attains
[1:24:02] nothing fault in him for he shall not
[1:24:05] speak of himself but whatsoever he shall
[1:24:08] hear that shall he speak and he will
[1:24:11] show you things to come show you
[1:24:16] revelation but remember they all had the
[1:24:20] right Holy Ghost there's not a wrong
[1:24:22] Holy Ghost since the day of Pentecost
[1:24:25] there's been the right Holy Ghost fall
[1:24:27] on the people amen but it's not been in
[1:24:32] the full word revival until today
[1:24:38] because God had to work through a narrow
[1:24:41] path especially in the dark ages brother
[1:24:47] Graham said it was just death for you to
[1:24:48] say you believed in the Lord Jesus
[1:24:49] Christ right then you come up into
[1:24:52] Luther well now Luther was Luther was a
[1:24:55] mostly all Catholic even when he got
[1:24:59] converted he ought to kill the Jews he
[1:25:03] smoked pipe great now the Holy Ghost
[1:25:06] didn't work in that the Holy Ghost can
[1:25:09] tell you to go smoke a pipe and drink a
[1:25:11] beer that was Luther but he had a word
[1:25:16] that says the just shall live by faith
[1:25:17] that was a narrow place that God had to
[1:25:20] work but it was the real Holy Ghost that
[1:25:23] was working through there then it got a
[1:25:25] little bit bigger with Wesley the stream
[1:25:27] got a little bit bigger then Pentecost
[1:25:30] the stream got just a little bit bigger
[1:25:31] same Holy Ghost but they only had a
[1:25:33] certain amount of word to work through
[1:25:37] you and I don't have that excuse God
[1:25:41] cannot and will not wink at our
[1:25:44] ignorance now listen to this quote right
[1:25:47] here real quick and we'll we'll be
[1:25:49] finished we got to get out of here go
[1:25:53] rest a little bit enjoyed yourself today
[1:25:56] I have being in church I enjoy myself
[1:25:58] anyway seeing you number 12 let's look
[1:26:01] at spoken words original seed we just
[1:26:03] heard this message Adams bride rejected
[1:26:06] to bring life she brought death we're
[1:26:10] her product our bodies
[1:26:13] this is a product of Satan and Eve this
[1:26:17] is we all die look at us you can see
[1:26:24] Jehovah's bride died he divorced her
[1:26:27] spiritually and he took the people out
[1:26:31] of the Gentiles for his name is that
[1:26:32] right his name like a woman takes a
[1:26:35] man's name the bride now what she done
[1:26:37] the same thing they did the other time
[1:26:39] denominated herself polluted here's my
[1:26:43] point but in every generation every
[1:26:46] revival brings forth some prophet of God
[1:26:52] so as this last revival this is it for
[1:26:55] us there had to be a prophet come on the
[1:26:59] scene at this revival time to bring what
[1:27:02] bring the pure word revival not a
[1:27:07] sinking not a fini not a moody they were
[1:27:09] fine took people in the kingdom but they
[1:27:11] were all Trinitarians everyone I'm work
[1:27:16] so there's that part of God that he
[1:27:19] can't work in he can only work in pure
[1:27:23] unadulterated word I'll read it to you
[1:27:25] right here in just a second but in every
[1:27:28] generation every revival brings forth
[1:27:30] some prophet of God a prophet is a
[1:27:33] preacher true preacher on the word that
[1:27:37] stays with the word and they bring forth
[1:27:40] the revival that gathers that elect out
[1:27:42] of that generation but now watch then
[1:27:45] she goes into seed then God will never
[1:27:50] use it again not not full word seed
[1:27:54] denominational see because this
[1:27:56] hybridized that can't come back up again
[1:27:58] I ask any theologian any historian to
[1:28:02] tell me one time that the denomination
[1:28:03] ever rose up she never did she died when
[1:28:06] she denominated and there's where she
[1:28:08] laid let's go to endtime seed sign
[1:28:10] number thirteen but in the face of all
[1:28:14] that there is a real bride that God is
[1:28:17] bringing forth and has a little bit out
[1:28:20] of each each time there's been a
[1:28:23] Reformation there's been so much looks
[1:28:26] much of the word spread forth not all of
[1:28:30] it so much of the word spread forth and
[1:28:32] each generation gets its time did you
[1:28:34] ever notice there'll be a man of God
[1:28:37] come along that will strike fire with
[1:28:38] God and there'll be a great revival
[1:28:40] sweep the lamb and what happens
[1:28:42] immediately after that they take that
[1:28:44] man's idea and denominated brother
[1:28:51] brother said you won't denominator this
[1:28:52] message but they'll organize it in the
[1:28:54] letters see that's what they're doing
[1:28:55] now immediately after that they take
[1:28:59] that man's ideas and denominator and
[1:29:01] bring in Creed's and mix with it there
[1:29:04] she dies and never rises again always
[1:29:07] has been always will be
[1:29:09] every time but each generation what does
[1:29:11] it get look at this its opportunity at
[1:29:16] the fresh word of God fresh word of God
[1:29:20] each time like Lutheran and
[1:29:23] justification that was fresh they've
[1:29:24] never been preached before that was
[1:29:26] fresh started a revival then Wesley
[1:29:30] under sanctification the Pentecostals
[1:29:33] move under the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:35] Spirit see each one gets its chance then
[1:29:38] what does the men do that follows those
[1:29:41] great reformers denominated organize it
[1:29:46] mix it with Creed's mix in Creed's with
[1:29:49] it a little bit hearing a little bit
[1:29:51] layer a new bunch of school scholars
[1:29:53] comes along with a bunch of psychology
[1:29:55] just the same as the Eve was trying to
[1:29:57] find some new light that's why we're not
[1:29:59] this revivals not trying to find some
[1:30:01] new light we need to revive the light we
[1:30:05] got mix it up with the word of God death
[1:30:10] her ideas with the word of guns death a
[1:30:13] way with the organization and died
[1:30:15] spiritually that's exactly right that's
[1:30:17] the way it always always been till God
[1:30:23] had to send us a prophet not like any of
[1:30:25] the other prophets this is the end time
[1:30:29] prophet this prophet preached the
[1:30:31] message to get us to that full mature a
[1:30:35] shanaar maturing of the fruit everybody
[1:30:39] got that say man
[1:30:40] all right let's go to number 14 we'll
[1:30:41] get finished with this a couple more
[1:30:45] quotes that all right look God in his
[1:30:49] body Christ what we're going to talk
[1:30:53] about transfer power next Sunday God in
[1:30:56] his body Christ Christ in his body the
[1:30:59] bride oh my god made manifest in Christ
[1:31:05] Christ made manifest in the bride and as
[1:31:09] God took from the body of Adam the woman
[1:31:11] and she fell then God has took from the
[1:31:14] body of Christ his flesh his body which
[1:31:16] is his word and it's bringing a bride
[1:31:20] out that won't fall by denomination or
[1:31:23] creed no sir but she is coming back with
[1:31:26] the pure don't tell us we can't do this
[1:31:30] don't tell us we can't do this
[1:31:33] I'm talking about all of us don't tell
[1:31:35] us we can't do this don't tell us we
[1:31:37] can't get this thing right she's coming
[1:31:40] back with the pure unadulterated Word of
[1:31:43] God being manifested I hope that every
[1:31:47] man that hears this tape and every woman
[1:31:49] will start a revival will understand it
[1:31:53] because if you understand it it will
[1:31:55] start a revival she is the second Eve
[1:31:58] but she is not breaking and spoiling her
[1:32:01] skirts of purity and holiness to her
[1:32:06] husband she'll stay with his word
[1:32:09] regardless of what anybody says you can
[1:32:14] have all the ecumenical moves you want
[1:32:16] to and all the affiliations I belong to
[1:32:19] this one I listen to this one online and
[1:32:21] I that's all right Pfister pure
[1:32:25] unadulterated word but it just makes you
[1:32:28] feel good and don't make you live right
[1:32:30] it's worthless
[1:32:33] number 15 this is one I wanted to get to
[1:32:35] right here in town seed seats on priests
[1:32:39] in Tifton Georgia right here down south
[1:32:42] then I mean that's the south as you can
[1:32:44] get without going to Florida but watch
[1:32:47] what he says and I believe that these
[1:32:50] latter days signs and things that's
[1:32:52] happening
[1:32:53] every one of them is peeling together to
[1:32:56] show that Christ is ready to come for
[1:32:58] his bride listen to this as God in his
[1:33:03] word no become by a word revival as God
[1:33:07] in his word made manifest in a man a
[1:33:10] perfect man who's he talking about
[1:33:12] Christ so is God and His Word coming
[1:33:16] again and making himself manifested in a
[1:33:20] bride not will do like Eve did highbreed
[1:33:25] it to something else but the
[1:33:27] unadulterated Word of God will be born
[1:33:31] into that church I'll clap that's mean
[1:33:38] you and she'll stand like Jesus Christ
[1:33:44] did coalmine do what with his spirit
[1:33:50] anointing in his word amen I believe
[1:33:55] it's the announcement now 1962 March the
[1:34:01] 19th brother Branham was announcing that
[1:34:04] something there was a shifting of power
[1:34:09] coming right here amen I believe it's
[1:34:12] the announcement now now what did
[1:34:16] brother Branham do he he came to give us
[1:34:19] the pure unadulterated Word of God apart
[1:34:21] from any Creed apart from anything that
[1:34:22] anybody can say out there in the
[1:34:25] denominational world this is the
[1:34:29] ministry of Jesus Christ just like it
[1:34:32] was three and a half years of when he
[1:34:34] was alive if it's not then it's false
[1:34:37] Luther had part of it sure Wesley had
[1:34:39] part of it but they could no one preach
[1:34:41] the pure unadulterated word like this
[1:34:43] prophet in the end time because that was
[1:34:45] the anointing that was on that prophet
[1:34:48] and this end time to what give us a Holy
[1:34:51] Ghost atmosphere to get us out of here
[1:34:54] not to put us in the grave let me prove
[1:34:58] that let's go to job 33 this is one of
[1:35:00] my favorite scriptures we read a long
[1:35:01] time ago but I want you to see how what
[1:35:03] job taught about this job dirty job

[1:35:25] interpreter what among a thousand I say
[1:35:31] one among a million ten million to show
[1:35:36] unto man his uprightness
[1:35:40] listen brother Brahm came to condemn the
[1:35:43] people that turned his message down but
[1:35:45] he came to tell me and you that we're
[1:35:46] perfect show unto man his uprightness
[1:35:50] then he is gracious unto him and says
[1:35:53] deliver him from going down to the pit I
[1:35:56] have found that word if you look in your
[1:36:01] Scofield Bible that word ransom means
[1:36:04] atonement I have found an atonement I
[1:36:09] have found a token that's not just going
[1:36:13] to save my soul it's gonna take me up
[1:36:18] then his gracious unto him and said
[1:36:21] deliver him from going down to the pit I
[1:36:23] have found a ransom his flesh shall be
[1:36:28] fresher than a child he shall return to
[1:36:33] the days of his youth

[1:36:57] shall pray unto God and He will be
[1:37:00] favorable unto him and he shall see his
[1:37:03] face with joy for he will render under
[1:37:06] man unto men his righteousness musicians

[1:37:11] he looked at the pond men and if any say
[1:37:14] I have sinned and perverted that which
[1:37:16] was right and it profited me not he will
[1:37:19] deliver his soul
[1:37:20] from going into the pit and his life
[1:37:24] shall see the light lo all these things
[1:37:28] work if God oftentimes with men to bring
[1:37:32] back his soul from the pit and to be
[1:37:35] enlightened with the light of the living
