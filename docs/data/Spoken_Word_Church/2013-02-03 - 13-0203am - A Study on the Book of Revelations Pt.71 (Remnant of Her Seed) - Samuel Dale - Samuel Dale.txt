are the body of Christ see everybody in the house of the Lord had a wonderful time last night in the uh Bible study didn't get into a lot but we had a lot of this straight flat discussions and it I think it turned out good you know right to to and all of that and we got by without the weather problem because it did look like it was going to really get rough for a little bit but then it just moved on out you I know everybody was praying and we just asked the Lord to move it out and it just moved out and everything was okay but we appreciate the Lord now remember the I know Terrence has made these announcements but I want to make sure everybody's here remember the banquet on the 16th the Saturday the 16th and remember the announcements you'll be there at 5: and we'll you know we're going to take pictures no later than 6 so if you come and you're not there without a death certificate or a speeding ticket one of the three then you won't get your picture made so don't come in with her feelings you got the rules and the regulations we try to go by all right so just keep that in mind and remember this coming Wednesday is the last day you could be able to sign up so if you don't sign up to be able to go don't come up to a day or two later and say I decided to come forget we're blunt plain you know and so that's all right but hate to be that way all right but remember that uh remember Sister Johnny this morning she would called and was coughing like everything Brother Ray called and said sister Kathy was real sick brother Dean's here this morning sister Peggy's been real sick with the nose bleeding and stuff like that and we were talking with her but we didn't get a chance to go see her cuz she went to the hospital and thank God that she got to that point cuz it could have been bad you know you know we know she passed out and things because you know the doings but yet God is always good to us and doing that all right now when the announcements to be made brother Tom Ernest will be with us on Wednesday the 13th of February so he'll be with us for that Wednesday night service brother Tom Ernest and then brother Claude wisinger will be here with us on March the 10th so remember these two announcement I gave them to brother Joe while I go to announce them and remember that also while you're standing we got an announcement that the uh brother guest and Diner is having the Word of Life Tabernacle their youth banquet and the dates are on here and the things and brother Matt Watkins will be doing the speaking and he gave a special note here and I emphasize the note that he's talking about the the transportation now listen to the wording the transportation to and from the church and activi and loding arrangements are the responsibility of the adults youth leaders bringing them remember to ask for rates not Motel there will only be chaperon and supervision for the Youth at the church not at the hotels like we have had in the previous years and it's a parents Guardian responsibility to be sure you are aware of this information so now I say to you that we will pay for the children to go only if accompanied by an adult right in the motels and taking care of the transportation and your total responsibility of them while they're there right all right and the only way we'll do is for you to go with them a woman with the girls and a man with the boys you're going to have to stay in the room yeah we're making it plain and blunt where it won't be misunderstood we've had problems before sometimes because we didn't blunt it out yeah so this is blunt we will pay for it if you'll do that if you don't you take them yourself right you send them yourself that's your children that's not mine but I'm from the church mhm right it will only be done and paid for if and we're glad to do that but not to where that you won't be Shaffer on because remember you're there representing us and so again now you got to be a woman go and stay in the room right there's got to be a mango and stay in the room with the boys it's got to be right or we will not pay for it and you're going to be responsible and do you realize what responsibility is right if something goes wrong you're held accountable right that's right so if you're willing to accept responsibility and do that's fine right but if not then forget it right you know so then if you want to take your children and go or send them that's your business it's not me but we won't be having nothing to do with those things in that line okay Revelations 1 in Revelations 12 I think we got basically all of the announc ments uh that was to be made is there any other announcement anybody can think of Minister meeting onight ministers meeting on the 9th of March right at brother um Bill Bill y so if any of the ministers wants to go uh let us know we'll be glad to to haul you along and have a good time doing it okay amen all right Revelations 1 and Revelations 12 father we thank you for all things we just ask you to have your way with each and every one of us first off forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you and Lord the actions of our lives and the things we we don't know where we reject your word because we've always tried to believe that but we know in our actions of our lives and things are not too good sometimes and we're sorry and you just make a way and all because it's humanly that we we are what we are no excuse but yet being that so you just come and change us and make us what you want us to be as we speak upon your word you come Lord and you have your way with each and every one of us and Lord as we read your word you come and speak to us about your word thank you for a lot that are back because the sicknesses that has been Among Us with the coughing and the flu and the bugs and all and a lot are back today Lord in in your comfort and joy of sitting and listening to the word instead of having to listen on the internet we thank you for that that some can Lord still listen and we pray that you'd reach out there now and touch those that are not here because of being sick sister Gibby sister Kathy sister Johnny Lord just those three that we know and we pray that you would touch their hearts Lord this morning through the opening of the word forgive our sins as we say again and keep us in your love in Jesus name amen amen always we've been reading Revelations 1 1-3 because what is it this book is the revelation of Jesus Christ the entire book from Genesis to Revelation is a revelation of Jesus Christ all right the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand okay Revelations 12 we will just take over from verse 7 and go through the rest and try to express this of Revelation 7 today I mean Revelation 11 verse 7 and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fult and his angels He Prevail not neither was their place found anymore what there neither was there right not there right there t h e i r right place found anymore in heaven what about that you could remove something so much until he's not even a place right Satan's going to go out one day so far until he's not even a place of remembrance of it amen you know that's something is it thank God Amen all right and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and Kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuses them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb now watch this in a when we get back to these scriptures and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony amen and they love not their lives unto the death therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time that's right and when the dragon saw that he was cast into the Earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth The Man Child and the woman was given two wings of a great Eagle that she might fly into the Wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half times from the face of The Serpent and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood now remember water's people all right right after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood and the Earth helped the woman and the Earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the Dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was wroth with the woman and he went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keepeth the Commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word I hope that you're enjoying thoughts and things that we're trying to make on this one sister was saying the other day said you read and you hear what brother Brown says but said then just come along maybe somebody and just say a few words and it will open up that to work that it will give a greater understanding well that's all we're supposed to do you know we're supposed to to be into that now what have we found this is actually the tribulation period we will get back to it in a minute because that's why it gives you the times times and the half times which is 3 and 1/2 years right so basically what we're studying in the Book of Revelations where you're going into we gave the other day 7 8 uh 9 even 10 11 and now we're into chapter 12 is dealing with a 3 and 1/2 year period of time to Israel all right now cuz that's why your plagues your vows your trumpets Etc are to Israel and they're happening in that 3 and 1/2 year period And I keep emphasizing because I want you to say it because brother see it brother Brown says that the Daniel of the Old Testament is actually the Book of Revelations of the new all right right amen and in the Book of Daniel and I've asked you to go read it with this understanding you read it and it's a vision Y and then you read again mhm and it seems like something may be different right then you read another and it seemed like something different but if you'll remember it's all just Progressive that's right as is being made known and the travel coming through well so is the Book of Revelations from where we've been here in the the talking about the tribulation period and all of these things that are transpiring it's just in that short period of time but it's unfolding a lot of things that happen you read Revelation 6 and you do not find in Revelation CH 6 it even mentioned 144,000 you know the somebody's alarm going off in the car somebody's car alarm it just went off okay okay somebody hit the right button long as it Ain the but now if it is let them have the car with that uh be like oh what up brother Richards one brother Wood's one time and and I was preaching years ago and and uh all at once a commotion went on the outside you know and the dogs was running and barking I said and everybody just looking around I said keep you seated I said if there's anybody that'd be the blunt Target it'd be me so I'm up here just keep your seat and set there cuz if you go out there you might get in trouble yeah unless somebody had a gun or something go out there to do I said few minutes we'll tell somebody to go see what's going on yeah so it's just sensible things to do do okay but now listen The Book of Daniel then is is doing and remember John is 2 years y That's right on patmas 1895 96 two years writing these things right when anyone with a almost a a third grade education could sit down and write the words of the Book of Revelation in just a matter of a few hours or something uh these typ keep typing they could type the Book of Revelations in just a few minutes right but it covers a 2-year period so John's not in a dream two years no he's in and out he sees things he comes back and he sees something else he comes back and he sees something else like I said it's not saying in Revelation 6 where the seals are at of even mentioning 144,000 but then John is carried over and he sees Le and he picks up who that is that is in chapter six amen you know all right right see then 11 12 1 is dealing with that group of people because the bride goes up in Revelations 4:1 and she's not seen till 19:21 amen all right see then that way those natural things that are taking place I want to cover that in a minute that's taking place to Israel I don't want it to take place to me you know you may holler dream about it to me well we just don't like your carnal way of applying things well you know I've explained it over and over for 40 years you know almost amen the seals are to Israel Amen in the literal extent right right but we get the Revelation on all of that's right amen we see where the man of sin starts at right amen and comes down Through the Ages but you better not be over there when the man of sin sits in the temple of God showing himself to be as God because you're in a tribulation period you done miss the Rapture amen right see that's seal number one certainly don't want to be around when seal number six takes place in the tribulation amen that's right and we certainly know we don't fit in the one where where the fifth seal Jew you know right so then maybe we want to get down and just consider the thought instead of I just don't think that's right I got my own idea well good for you come and tell me what it is I'm open come and tell me what your idea is sure but now we're going to get into something just a minute that I dealt on beat on hollered on screamed on for 30 something years and that'll be our thought the Bible is written to were and your prophet's message is perfectly identical with the Bible and the way the Bible is written amen yes sir the Bible is written where it's got a compound meaning amen that's right yes now we read the scriptures and I know we all do okay we say and I'm listen forgive me now what you say I read the Robbie said it the other day so I think on him okay he's on the front row up here yeah he said he said I read something and he said I get something and he said I read something I get some more and I read something and get some more that's good because that's what it does it unfolds right but if we read something and then we get something different right now different like opposition right not different of who it's dealing with or times or whatever but dealing like opposition in other words you see the white horse rider over here is a Holy Ghost and you see him over here is Antichrist no that's not right no right that can't fit you can't have one God here and three Gods here but we're all saying the same thing no no is that enough nose right no it don't work but see it can be of a compound meaning now not one meaning being off hot dog the other meaning of black dog right you you you're done separated yourself right one can't say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and the other one say well in a way he was no now amen my brother stood right here one time talking about he said I I can see that myself is that white horse rider then he went through the seals and everybody oh great that's wonderful I I know I'm mean Old Goat but I got up behind him and was asked the question I got up and I said if the brother seen himself as the white horse rider he didn't say the horse he said the rider I said that's a Theon which is unable unconverted right Beast right you don't take an unconverted beast and convert it you that's what we was we lost but we wern't Beast we were just human beings they was lost amen see people don't like me because I'm that way but come on put it in the word that's right am I fought all these years and I thought about it the other day old shamard you know he didn't like it but he grabbed up a ox go one day and he went to work yep right and I thought well maybe it's about time for sham guard to start saying put up or shut up right get in or get out that's right because it's time we do amen amen well you're right in the middle I agree with you and I'm working on me you say no he's working on me well you better do some work yourself you know you don't just run well he'll take me out when he wants to uhuh no you better get it right all right but compound meaning Now does not mean two different meanings in the basis of one meaning this is wrong and you know this is wrong over here you'll see that it means it can apply here and it can apply here right right all right right brother R said even people MH right you know here and here right all right and we'll see that it will deal with is like I'm trying to bring about the opening of the seal you said well you preach this to us years and years I know it but maybe somebody out there needs it so you go to sleep and we'll take care it's on the internet you ought not be that nasty no order be harder that's right now order to walk down and say yeah with a pencil and say wake up yeah you know you remember they used to do that in the old days you know they had a had a big old stick and theyd walk along with a stick for men went to sleep they poked them if the women went to sleep they had a feather on the end you know they tickled them it's really nice to the women you know yeah they tickle okay get off get the meaning but listen Church see that's the way I understand the Bible right that's it see then I can take what brother Brandon will say about the the seals or anything and and and I can look at it and I can agree with him when he says this is to the bride y right and then he comes over here say but this is to Israel y that's right that's right if you'll notice this will be a key when when we get in a minute cuz he uses the word a lot of times he'll use for Israel he'll use the word literal that's right notice in you're listening he'll be using say literal and then he'll say spiritual now you can take those two and they'll make a beautiful picture if you line it up correctly if it don't you got a literal and a spiritual and you're saying well brother Dale's wrong cuz this means this if we get time to get to it brother Brown says the remnant of the woman's seed right is who yep is it Revelation 13 12 we just read he says it's the foolish virgin that's right no no no no no I got to quot let me finish it before you do and he says it's the 144,000 right and you know he's perfectly right sure and exactly with the scriptures mhm the foolish virgins and the 144,000 listen have the testimony of Jesus Christ sure sure they foolish vir no they don't yes they do yes they do absolutely amen and you see then that way there is a compound meaning y not different meanings but using it one time to apply to this and another time apply to this and you can see it open so I want to give the the the quotes on this I know I say that a lot but go ahead brother with number one one let's get in it but remember now we're not just talking about Revelations 12 or 11 or 10 if you'll look at this this way you'll see the seals open that the literal seals and the things that are happening are to Israel that's right but they've got to have a beginning back there to where he would even say it like this he said them seals that seventh seal using both of them he said started in Genesis y and worked its way down but see then we're standing here today people say the seven seal ain't broke yet this way but see that's the way people are we try to make our own Thoughts with our own revelation we think and don't think Church come on you can take my word or you can do what you want to with it don't think that you can't have wrong Doctrine and set down and scriptures will flow together that will look correct don't you ever think that because you got a problem one of these days cuz you're going to say the Lord led me to read that I always say something led me because I figure a lot of times old Devils led me don't you think Satan can't put scriptures together no now I got a quote he can't put the word together that's exactly right but Satan can bring scriptures and make them look so beautiful right you think the trinitarian people don't say that the Holy Spirit tells them there's a trinity Y and they read the Bible y that's right the same scriptures you read to see one God they read the Bible and says it says three y now so wrong some words that's not compound meaning now if you think that's what I'm talking about let's erase that that's not compound meaning you see a trinity and other one see a Oneness or something that's not compound compound is going to be something related together right those seals open to the Bri to Israel but we are the bride right they open through the prophet's message and we by that get to ability to change these bodies will be changed amen and go into Rapture amen from the same thing that will put them in the tribulation and God standing there through two prophets preaching to them in the tribulation to L say where did you get the nail prints in your hand there's you compound one showing us the other one showing them if you'll study the Bible that way or anything you'll see it a whole lot better all right so let's see what brother R had to say about it this part of compound meaning and then we're going to get on down into the other about time all right for the mesy palor locus caterpillar can Locus canor caterpillar 53 612 and that's how the Spirit come upon this prophet and he he foresaw things he saw the condition of the Jews and he saw the condition of the church in this day right compound right now watch now this prophecy of course like all other prophecy has a compound meaning a prophecy sometimes has a natural meaning then it has a spiritual meaning now he didn't say different meaning right okay now of course the natural meaning of that even Dr Scofield's notes he said I'm not a scoffield ID you pronounce but however in his footnotes there he gives and he's referring to this part of the scripture the one he's dealing with that it meant when the syrians come over and invaded he's he's covering another scripture not in the Book of Revelation covering that part but it's also had a meaning of the last days so the scripture he's talking about that means the syrians come down and invade as a meaning that comes over here right okay so then your Bibles in the last days the condition of the church spiritually in the last days amen so a compound meaning has a natural meaning then it has a spiritual meaning go ahead to the next one message Dr Moses 55 1114 e16 all scripture has a compound meaning are it runs in cycles for instant there where it said in St Matthew I believe it was out of Egypt I have called my son now that scripture that Matthew was referring to was really pertaining to Israel okay and God said out of Egypt I'll call my son Israel yep he called his Israel son out but it also meant Jesus out of Egypt yep I've called my son and how it routines back the cycle of time swinging back ever so often history repeats itself the scripture repeats itself down through the age any scholar knows that that ever studied it from a spiritual standpoint to watch how scripture will repeat itself run in cycle like that it certainly does all right one says call a son out of Egypt you remember the story Pharaoh all the kids we'll get back to it in a minute or what you call him Herod Herod was the one that was doing that Caesar if you want to put his name there trying to kill all the babies Joseph and Mary took Jesus to Egypt Y and he came out of Egypt all right but a compound meaning man what I'm talking about the children of Israel coming up out of Egypt the other one is the compound meaning Jesus who come up out of Egypt that doesn't say Jesus come out out of um some place way over the ocean you see the point is there and it's not well that's just the way you see it but I see it like this okay if it's not contrary but if you see a white dog and I see a black one somebody's goofed up somewhere so it's not in that form see it's it's compounding it look at the next one this is life preaching 1957 602 he's illustrating it now like a compound so watching no wonder then the word life must have a a a compound meaning to it must mean more than than one thing life itself means in existence so then if thy loving kindness is better than life then what could be any better see two different meanings right right life just means an existence but if his loving kindness is better than life it's got to be greater right because God alone has eternal life God alone has eternal life if we can't if if we can get that straight now it will be easy for us to see the great picture God sets before us how that some day that everything that isn't of God will vanish and perish and go away but life will be brought into the be right yes come me go ahead to number four here you himym 1957 7:25 and here your himym is Matthew 17 right on the mountain Etc right okay getting that so you'll understand what he saying this is rather an unusual scripture and I wish to not of course we know that the real meaning for most of you ministers refer to this scripture and watch to is to the second coming the order of the com second coming of Christ which is right it's most certainly right okay now that's the scripture y but every scripture has a compound meaning many times a prophecy will mean a certain thing to happen here and repeat it over here again like in St Matthew the third chapter when he said out of Egypt I've called my son now that refers back to the calling out calling out Jacob was his son also so and it meant calling out of his son Jesus so it had a compound meaning compound two times that it was meant to be fulfilled so now I hope you're getting what my point right man see then the seals is to Israel Revelations 7 8 9 10 you say 10 in that's us this message is going to Israel 11 12 13 14 15 I'm going to keep repeating this for 15 times to make sure you get it see that way you can look at the scriptures and you can say wait a minute now that was there but is it here mhm cuz see I can take if you want to be smart eally I can say no man can call Jesus the Christ that was back there I don't have nothing to do with us like a big man in this message said years ago and I heard him he said when you say the third pull is to the bride he said it was only for Jesus and brother Brown I said well I just can't read that away that ain't what he said that's right amen same man said I don't believe and I heard him said I don't believe in dispensations and the Bible said the dispensations and brother R said you people that don't believe in dispensation what about this but you see I going to change nobody the prophet tell you something they going to change you until you believe it right all right but see look what it's at look at the next one number five this day this scripture fulfilled 65 219 paragraph 5758 and history always repeats it itself and scripture has a compound meaning to it and a compound Revelation right okay not just a meaning that has a compound Revelation I called my son out of Egypt that revealing Egypt coming out Israel coming out of Egypt Revelation to what Jesus coming out so that's what he's referring to for instance it says in the Bible that out of Egypt I called my son referring to Jesus run the margin on that and you'll find you find out also refer to Jacob same scripture Jesus was his greater son Jacob was his son that he called out of Egypt which the Scofield references and all the other references give to it because that's the Scripture it was referring to to it had a double answer it had an answer to Jacob called out and to Jesus called out right all right now so it's got a double meaning not a double meaning as different I keep repeating that see I I preach something and people they they run across and they just hear what they want to hear and then they come along and say well brother de said so and so I can say I didn't say that I heard you see your mind and west running that's what you heard but you heard what you wanted to hear you don't ever run it back what do you mean I listen that why I need to run back let's do it again I heard brother say so yeah you're the one responsible for saying I said something when I didn't say it I'm responsible for saying something that's right okay now but think about it see come compound now two even meanings compound as even to a revelation of calling out of Egypt of Jacob a revelation of calling Jesus out of Egypt so now you don't have no problem with the scripture do you you don't have to go along that means that well see now you've narrowed yourself down you have no hope right you can't study the Bible like that you can't study this message out way well brother Rand I illustrate all time and say I can prove that you're born again and baptized into the body and then you'll turn around a little bit and say maybe in the same message might say it that the baptism into the body is the birth of Jesus the new birth of you know Jesus Christ and your soul right now you've made him say things he didn't say I give you word for word right all right but you see that's where our minds twist you brother you're trying to do away with my ability to think let me be honest I wish I could is that any problem you know 40 years I've been trying to do that so might as well tell you I've been trying to convert your mind I don't have anything to do with converting your soul right God has to do that but your pastor has to get on there and deal with these things and what have I always dealt with the things that look like Daniel 7 weeks right that look like said this and look like he said this and I would spend months showing that that's not what he's saying doctrines and ideas people have had and then have to spend months trying to erase that yep just like it was when the two Soul came out this man said one day he said I've been looking for that all my life well why didn't he preach it yeah but see he so thought it was true right you go tell a trinitarian there's no such thing as a trinity in the Bible yeah he'll give you a lot of scriptures and a lot of understanding and you know what he can pull up this message and give you a lot of quotes well brother Ram said let's stand and address the third person of the Trinity right that's right y now do you ever teach a trinity not even before before the opening of the word in 63 he didn't do nothing like that you understand what I'm getting at see we make him say what we want him to say that's right amen that's it I sat down before I preach anything I try to find the pros and the cons the things that seem different and don't mind giving them to you because somewhere they'll come together amen that's right now we believe in slips of the tongues we believe in all kind of things right around said 700 7,000 that's a human being well he was a prophet I believe everything well your mind slips a whole lot I get tickled at somewh around here that get up and say brother Dale most quotes in scriptures and then when they're up here quoting saying I just sat there Li boy he missed that he quoted that wrong I try to be nice I know I'm not but that's all right it's just it's not being silly either but now listen we got into this why I started off with Revelations 11 or 12 excuse me what at 127 cuz we got kind of down to that of Michael being cast out of heaven so he was cast out of Heaven before the foundation of the world you know Satan was Lucifer Michael and Lucifer F Lucifer was cast out not Micha but then need to be cast out in the last day amen that's right the Same Old Devil with a different group of people right you know or whatever talks whatever you want see and that's compound see that shows you the meaning that you can read the book of Revelations and you can see well this is not so confusing anymore haven't you read that haven't you read there where Michael and War in heaven you wonder where that happen yeah right and then you pick up the message and say boy the message is going to clear this up real good Prophet is going to tell us that was back there for the foundation world and then one day you're reading along and around says when we go up Satan's cast out cuz he's up in heaven now accusing the brother uh you think it don't get confusing you can make brother brandom say anything you want him to say that's right that's right right and we done that when we was the bad news I told you we preached one week there was none good no not one we sent everybody to Hell the next week we preached be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven at perect send every Baptist to Heaven I said Baptist to heaven we didn't want all the rest of to go you say that's silly no that's the truth if they didn't come our way they didn't go come on but listen church so let's read it reread that quote again let see compound go ahead with number six compound meaning compound Revelation even mhm brother says in the 361 of the first seal 63 318 then in Revelations 12:7 when Satan is cast out the accuser you want to put that down because I want to read it we haven't got time to now it's 28 going but in Revelations 12: 7-9 Satan the spirit the devil which is up there now now accuser of our Brethren all right the church is taken up and Satan is cast out when the church goes up Satan comes down then Satan incarnates himself in the Antichrist and it's called the beast that's after we get out of here why cuz we go up he comes out right he can't stay up there where we're at what about God as I tried to get across the other day God thinking so much of you amen did he let the devil sit there and talk about you and condemn you and tell all of your wrongs your faults your failures and what you're doing and he sat there and said see thank you amen but you let her go up he won't even leave him die right you think that don't joy to my heart somebody's going to be this bride that goes up when it the devil's coming out amen that's all right so there's a compound meaning right and do you know like I was trying to cover the other day when God turns to those 144,000 Satan is cast out and is's up earth right but you know that 144,000 under their two witnesses is so strong and so great a group of people until Satan is cast out of them the ability to deal with them and do you realize the bride compound meaning the bride right now Satan is being cast out of your mind by the revealed word but not by thoughts and ideas or opinions but only by the revealed word amen amen come on you're old enough if is sensible enough to be plain we are not quote from the prophet a match for the devil right right you think you get him conquered well I conquered him I quit smoking but I got to go get me a different up or I quit drinking yep you know what I'm saying that's right don't ever think you can control your mind and the Bible says your tongue is the biggest problem too right and sister McGarity used to say that little wet red thing or what it was flapping backwards and forth between them old wet walls yeah cuz your Bible says the tongue can't be controlled right now but it wasn't talking about Christians now who's the Bible written to that's right amen if you're going to go that way we don't need a statue of perfect man that's right we just say we already got it it don't matter how we live we we're good Badness we're going to Heaven Come On Church time to get off of it quit playing games with ourselves that's right and get on with God Amen right and realize realization so when we go up Satan come down yep that's right amen now who do you think is fighting the battle I thought Michel was Christ I thought the Book of Daniel that have encourage you to read the compare to the Book of Revelation I thought the Book of Daniel said Michael had to come to the aid of Gabriel and take over fighting Satan Gabriel could to come to Daniel that's right and the Bible says D Michael you're what Prince amen and what is a prince a son waiting for papa to die to where he can become king and you know really he don't have to wait right you said get in the bot okay glad you thought of that David put Solomon in his king that's right before he died right y so don't run off with it read your Bible he put him in as king crowned him and everything see my daddy don't have to die right amen cuz my daddy can't die amen were you following me see using compound meaning compound thoughts to try to get it to where we can see this and this and how it comes together but around him in Daniel 70 weeks what did he say he says seven I think seven times he says it's one week left Y and he said this is what the Holy Spirit put on my PIN to right y That's Right years later they ask him said you said he said you didn't understand me that's right right see everybody said he was wrong back here and right over here when it's compound right am amen that's right one week left to Israel but there only 3 and A2 years of Jesus's Ministry left Israel right in both places amen that's right yes sir compound meaning compound thought let's get into Revelations 12 let see how quick we can run down to here so go ahead we'll pick up back nth verse and we'll just read and make not too many comments and the Great Dragon who's the dragon did we cover it in the message before that dragon is wrong right right okay now was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his Angel were cast out with it all right now and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and Kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuses them before our God day and night do you realize I heard a great voice in heaven saying salvation and strength and the kingdom of God when Satan is cast out what a glorious shouting but do you realize that is in the tribulation period go say it was cast out after we go up come on all right and they're being killed the 144,000 that killed the two witnesses are killed right but yet the Bible writes it as salvation is come strength is coming the kingdom of God has come and like I said we look at it as trying to figure out this at the other and God's tender hand of Mercy allowed over 6 million Jews to be killed to drive them to the Homeland right then thought so much of them till he pulled out a predestinated group of fi seals you and gives them eternal life amen thank you thank you that's right oh but if God was with us we wouldn't be sick you want scriptures many are the Affliction of the righteous but the Lord leadth out of them all well I'm just having so many problem what do you expect amen thank you Lord your Prophet said we're not going out of here with a flly bed of East and we're not going through the tribulation get it that's what a lot of people thinks they put them together but like I said the other day you sure W to talk about the third pull but brother R said when that squeeze comes down watch that third pull then right so it must be going to get squeezed out somewhere but you know it's not going to squeeze us out and put us down it's going to squeeze us up amen you realize the devil is the best thing you got except salvation right right that's right amen that's right because he'll beat you in the line yes and God stands back and says let him have it let him a couple extra time he needs it you say oh God's the saddest then no no he knows what we need yes he does thank God for troubles and persecutions and trials around said they are part of the Christian Life yes right that's all right y so what is he saying and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony and love not their lives unto the death that 144,000 overcome by the blood of Jesus Christ L that 144 and the two witness I mean the other two WT 14 and the foolish virgins will put them right in there in a minute with a prophet all right and look but it's by the word of their testimony see when I said that while ago I notic some of you kind of look back wondering what when I said the foolish virgin has a testimony of Jesus Christ you better think who you think they've got they talk about Jesus Christ more than we do oh Lord oh they have the testimony they don't have the possession oh my right come on now watch it all tie together we get to it in a minute but they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of the testimony they L their lives unto the death therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time and when the dragon saw that he was cast into unto the Earth he persecuted the woman y right y now that's not the bride because that's tribulation period so he's persecuting Israel right the 144,000 because like I said the other day he's not persecuting natural Israel natural Israel is after we leave out of here in a Rapture natural Israel is in a covenant the nation of Israel is in a covenant with the Antichrist they're on his side who do you than's going to kill the 144,000 and the two witnesses they don't need no Romans no more to okay it right that's right and you can call the UN all you want to it ain't going to help you no cuz they're going to be the ones that's going to be pushing it but it's natural Israel as a nation is going to kill those people right come on you said you don't have no quote for show me a quote you got some other way I just think sensibly if it can't be a and b can't be two different things cuz they're two different looking numbers but if a is a then a is a so I this the way I deal with all right and watch and the woman was given and who's the woman Israel the 144,000 in Tribulation that clock is stopped what time is 11:30 I figure I look at this clock cuz I feel like it's about 15 after2 and when the dragon saw he was cting the Earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth The Man Child who brought forth The Man Child that's right we was in 11 coming forth right who brought forth the Manchild Israel gave birth now not all Israelites we're going to get to it in a minute a Remnant we can spend a week on Remnant y you know brother ROM calls um Mary um John Etc this just a few he calls them the remnant we spent a lot of time on the remnant but I'm just trying to get a point to you the woman which brought forth The Man Child Israel the elected predestinated Israel the chosen of Israel gave birth to Jesus Christ the nation of nation of Israel never gave birth to Jesus Christ that's right it was only just a handful of predestinated that brought Christ only 144,000 is going to bring Christ in the end time right right already 3 million or so Jews over there right I think that's the last I heard it what and the woman was given two wings of a great eal now you remember the story brother around and said those people didn't want to come home and said those prophets walked out there and told them and said you're going to home on the wings of an eagle they got on the Plains and flew all right they're going back to the Homeland why to see the Messiah yes and the woman was given two wings of a great Eagle that she might fly into the Wilderness into her place where she has nourished for a time and times and a half time from the face of the serpent three and one half years time times times is two time times the two makes three and a half yep right yep only three half years in the tribulation period but you know that Israel been going to the Homeland for many many years that 144,000 been gathered ain't no tell what country they come from they've been gathered to Israel amen that's the only ones God's dealing with you got to deal with a natural Nation to bring it up and make it right one of these days I preach what I said that i' only spoke to two people about it and I spoke to one more this morning about two more excuse me but watch what happen and the serpent cast out of his mouth water which the Bible says water is multitudes and people right okay as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood in other words he's going to kill her right the natural nation of Israel is going to persecute and kill those two witness in 144,000 yep because they believe in Jesus Christ back up where was we want to go don't run but by the testimony the testimony of those two witnesses won't be Jehovah the old to be Jesus of the new but they'll know that that's the very Jehovah the old one of these days I want to preach on see whether you believe in one God or not he oh yes I believe in one God if you can't tie together the Old Testament Saints and the New Testament Saints somewhere and bring it right you've done Miss brother Brown's message and you're trinary now you can do what you want to with that statement if you can't have a Jehovah the Old Testament what did Brother around say Jehovah's bride and Jesus's bride is that two Brides if it is your trinitarian compound me right right what about it I'm just trying to say what brother rday surf cast out his mouth what and the Earth helped a woman and the Earth opened her mouth now I didn't get back up into here but you get back up into there is is see as I said it took a long time to driving back you know that they coming over the wall like to Israel coming over the wall was coming to the United States that's why it's got to be here to America we're going to get this evening Lord willing Revelation 13 is USA y okay all right see they came to America they came over the wall they were placed there and the Jews have come to America they've been protected in this American Wilderness not persecuted yeah whereas around the world we were being killed that's back dark coming up to it that's right coming up to this tribulation you can stay for months just going through the scripture one at a time okay I'm trying to get short you think I'm the old draw out old all right forgive me I'm just mean I can't help it God chose me to be what I am and I can't change it you say well what if it was a devil okay we'll find out one of these days whether it was or not but if it was God you got trouble if if is the devil I got trouble okay the Earth open help the woman right those two witnesses can't be killed and the 144,000 can't be killed until the end of the ministry of the two witnesses right right amen so don't matter what floods you run after them what group of people you try to get them killed by what about Moses you come on I wish I had for hour what about Moses you never thought about Moses come on I'll tried to explain that to you before but now here sits phoh and Moses goes up and he said let my people go he says go cut his throat how come he didn't why didn't he do that he's scared cuz remember the guy that's sitting on the throne when Moses came back was not Daddy Pharaoh that was there that believed Moses was his Grand son you know all right and made him his own son you know and would made him leader over Israel Y and that old guy got mad that when he left and he takes over but he still scar because Moses just walks up in his face let my people go right he said Moses I got enough sense you got enough sense no I can cut your throat he says go ahead and try that's right he said CU if you do he's not wrote the Bible but he said if you do there's going to be another Insurrection because remember I was the commander of the army that's right right was he he was in commanded Army Army of Israel he said I can just take over this place if I want to but said I didn't come down here to do that I come down here to get my people that's right just let them go and everything will be all right okay he won Face I I'm let him go the devil gets on him and say don't you turn him loose that's right right y read your Bible he in many cases is ready to free Israel but the Bible says the end the devil come on him devil come you know one day he finally got so much of it he said just get out of here speci cuz you done destroyed my whole nation come on F this in here the Earth swallows up all of that garbage and won't let them kill that 144,000 and two witnesses until they're finished with their ministry right right that's right they can't touch it but when they're finished they're killed okay that's right well that don't look good why would God let him be killed cuz he wrote and said he would right cuz how else can he get them in the Millennium that's right CU 144,000 remember was in the Millennium right what your Prophet said that's right the Unix to the brother so come on now we'll get out of this okay the dragon was Ral with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the Commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ what about it now watch who is this remnant of her seed I said a moment ago John and Mary and some of those that brother around n it says they're the remnant of Israel the 144,000 is a remnant of Israel okay but you know there's another part that's been fit in there that I love to be part of you know how you do you sisters you're going to make a dress and you take the P pattern and you lay it out and you cut out the the dress and you sew it up and make a beautiful dress and you have a lot of clippings or whatever you want to call it you have a lot of leftover material you know it's the same identical material right and see but it's just not chosen for that place the 144,000 is the remnant but they're not they just wouldn't chosen for to be the bride That Old Testament bride will come up one day but she will never be the Born Again Believers of the Bride of Jesus Jus Christ right she'll never be Joseph's wife right that was sitting in the temple in her father's house brother R said I was asked that question in the meeting recently where will they go brother R said we'll go over to the father's Palace you remember Joseph's wife was over in the palace right you know his brothers never did become his wife and you know if he had a bunch of sisters which probably did cuz he didn't list them you know right come on and you know that there's none of them chosen to be his wife but they were his brothers and sisters they got their place right it's all because of Calvary right right now they both they got to have these two groups we cover now is got to have the Commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ right okay so we're give them to you in order so go now Brothers if you will you going to have to jump now so go over to number 10 don't go to the next one that you're needing go to number 10 get we run it over cuz we could read the others but I'm doing this for a point all right the 10 virgins 144,000 196 12 11 in the morning paragraph 255 and that's the Seal of God we know that and remember there's only 144,000 of the Jews sealed which was the remnant of the Jews left over right and he goes into the Gentile bride so where is the seat of the woman The Remnant it's the 144,000 because we're dealing with the Israel in the tribulation right go ahead to number 11 this is still in the 10 virgins paragraph 3:16 how do you understand what the remnant of the Jews is 144,000 where they're sitting waiting right at the hour can you see now that the foolish virgin that he covers with them wouldn't take the oil and will have to rise and be separated rise and see got to do that but who is the remnant The 100 44,000 is the remnant of Israel and you know that Remnant according to what we read have the testimony of Jesus Christ but remember the fifth seal Jew it says for the word of God and the testimony they held right which was not the new birth of Jesus Christ but those 144,000 will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you call it the new birth I don't like the word New Birth because of the fact that the new birth to me puts you in the body of Christ right as a born again believer amen they receive eternal life right you can call it the baptism if you want to as long as you're holding it that they're not placed into the body of Christ right so they have their position they're the remnant of the woman seed all right now drop back to number eight okay and you'll see that he says it's the foolish version paragraph three I think it is the patus vision pretty good theology talking about what he writing think it too that they are the remnant the sleeping virgin is the The Remnant spoke of in Revelation now if you don't have the compound meaning where you going with it I just read to you that he says that it's 144,000 now he's saying it the foolish virgin see if you don't have the compound meaning you're lost right you're going to be arguing quotes right come on the sleeping virgin is a remnant of the remnant spoke of in Revelation of the woman see that keep the Commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ MH yep that foolish virgin will have the testimony of Jesus Christ and the word of God the testimony that they hold yep but they just don't have the new birth right the 144,000 are not in the body of Christ but they receiveing you bir the foolish virgin has to go to the white Throne to receive her new bird as you want to call it her eternal life who you see compound meaning right right compound meaning one more I think here go ahead with the next one you can read all that up down through there called Remnant and everything El leftover is called a Remnant needs to explain it okay number nine takeing sides with Jesus 62601 paragraph 55 which we realize in Revelation it's just 1 2 three chapters to the church the church goes up in the fourth chapter and does not return anymore till the 19th Chapter that's after the tri ation period when God called out the Jews that's right 56 all and like Enoch he went up before one drop of rain ever hit the earth he was gone and then the tribulation sets in see Noah was in the ark before any tribulation not out of Sodom before any tribulation set in and the church will be gone before any tribulation period right now what now during the tribulation that will be the sleeping virgin will be h hunted down by the dragon and Spurs water from his mouth the people not fing water peoples to try to conquer her which means multitudes and peoples armies that will search down and take this woman remnant of her seed and will kill her and that will be in a tribulation period that's right the church will be gone home prise the Lord now if you don't believe in compound meaning look where you're at you got a prophet telling you that Revelations means 144,000 you got a prophet that says Revelation means foolish virgins but what I love about it I'll just read to you what I wrote and then come on musicians I'll just read to you what I wrote down see the remnant of the Bride is the foolish virgin M the foolish virgin is the remnant of the Bride right right she's watch left over right made of the same material but this doesn't have that chosen ability right amen but the remnant other Jews is 144,000 see because it's the same material see the foolish virgins have the teaching of Jesus Christ but not the new birth amen so they're known for their testimony of Jesus Christ whereas 144,000 which is here in the tribulation we're talking about have the testimony of Jesus Christ because they receive Jesus Christ into their heart am compound meaning y see makes it clear to where we can take this and this and say compound now folks don't please I know I'm sorry but don't come up with a black dog white dog and say brother Dale said compound meaning oh I believe that compound meaning Brother D I got it now that was a black dog that was a white dog now that's no such thing of what I said the remnant of the woman's seed being the 144,000 is the children of Israel The Remnant being the foolish virgin is the remnant left off of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's right that's not different meanings that's not different meaning that's a compound meaning of the same Revelation right cuz they both there in that tribulation have the testimony of Jesus Christ sure and all of them will be hunted down because of their testimony y the foolish virgin will be killed in the tribulation because of their testimony that's right the 144,000 and two witnesses be killed because of their testimony right amen is there enough in you and I to be tried for a testimony that's right all right and I'm not talking I've got some scripture I want to get into and I'm not talking about how goody goody you are cuz he ain't no goody goody in any of us amen bless God I don't do them things like I used to do wonderful that's your good neighbor right but does it make you a Christian no stand take on these things Remnant what 139 in spiral BL 139 in the spiral blue anybody have a need I'm rejoicing night and day I and the my brother and sister they leaving out to go to Florida you know for a little
