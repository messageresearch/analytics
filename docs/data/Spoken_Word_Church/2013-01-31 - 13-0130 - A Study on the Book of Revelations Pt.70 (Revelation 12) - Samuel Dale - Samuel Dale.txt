that's nothing to me i don't have any problem i just come get together and have a good time but now to get together with brothers and sisters that lord is something that the church sets up is one thing but uh you know that's that's your business a lot of people don't want to come don't want themselves to say fellowship but they won't talk about everybody that don't want to fellowship you know and i hear that a lot you know people say well the people don't want fellowship well i want to fellowship and i'll do everything i can to try to be there and do a little fellowship and have a good time in the lord if it's a sinful thing for us to have a banquet for all of the sweetheart banquets to get together with you with your husband and your wife for just one night and all then i guess we we've got a problem being sinful but i never have considered it to be that way i think it's a a good thing you know but uh you know that's up to you but remember sign up date february the 6th if you're not signed up by next wednesday don't come along thursday or something cause we'll order the food so we've got to get that done to get it set to work you know that we can do you know like that remember that revelations 1 and revelations 12. heavenly father we thank you for your love and your grace and to us thank you for all things we thank you for salvation for love and joy and peace in our hearts most of all we thank you for your word that you've given unto us because if it wasn't for the word we wouldn't know anything about salvation we wouldn't have any thoughts or ideas about you so we thank you we ask you now to just come on the scene and be with each and every one of us bless us as i try to speak tonight upon your word you come and use the lips and just use the ears to hear and those that are not able to be here with us tonight we pray that you would just bless each and every one because we know and realize the bad weather and situations but you know everybody can watch in their home we love you and we thank you we commit it all to you now in jesus name amen revelations 1 and then revelations 12. the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show into his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his angel and to his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is it he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written they're in well for the time is at hand and now let's go over to revelations 12 and we'll just read the first four verses and i hope we get over there i want to finish up revelation 11 but we'll read in revelations 12 verse 1 through 4. now appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven horns seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns up on his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and then cast him to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for her divine her child as soon as it was born you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now i hope you enjoyed the brother there sunday afternoon i really enjoyed his message you know i hope you did because that's what we want it to be for you to help you you know because i get my health too from the five full ministry and i believe in it now uh sunday morning there i only got part of what i was wanting to bring out but you know i decided not to take a another whole message on revelations 11 but to just do a little back up on it and then continue into chapter 12 and maybe that way we can can see you know a little more about it but you remember we were talking in in chapter 11 about the two olive trees and the two candlesticks you know standing before the god of the earth well then we got over into zechariah and we found that there was one olive tree i mean one candlestick and it was a seven golden candlestick and and the oil was pouring in from the olive oil you know to light the candles and do the things and i hope he was enjoying that part i did because thinking on it you know as the uh in the old testament it was looking forward so zechariah was looking forward to seeing the seven church ages and the candlesticks and the things and the olive trees and it would be then the old and the new testament i gave you those things that would represent you know the olive trees and the things in the pouring of the oil then when it would come on over into the book of revelations that you would see two olive trees and two candlesticks because you wouldn't be dealing there with the uh the church ages but you'd be looking back and you could see that there was seven candlestick form in the old testament and then there were seven in the new you know because that would cover the two and that would give the old and the new testament has to be in the candlesticks and then we seen that it was moses and elijah that was standing there to to bring the message you know and it would prove out to be the second coming of jesus christ through matthew there on the mount so you know tying that part together i'm just trying to take uh these things now and just run through them a little to help us to understand a lot of these symbols that you know are there in the scriptures that we look at and say well what does this mean and what does that mean now you know somewhere in here if you see something you want us to emphasize a little or remember how you say those words you know speak a little extra on it write us a question we'll try to cover those things and help us to see it but we just got part of chapter 11 because the part i wanted to bring out was you know coming down to work that if if you pull that up with us read the scriptures in chapter 11 then we'll go on and finish up into chapter 12 and get started on him because revelations 11 6 through 14 says these have power to shut heaven now this is the two you know two olive trees moses and elijah in the tribulation after the rapture of the bride this is to israel the calling out of the 144 thousand and it's like i told you i'll keep repeating this once you go through that seals then basically what you're looking at is israel in the tribulation no now we'll see tonight you got to back up and pick up some things it's like we did sunday with with the uh zechariah to back up and pick up to see what that would be and compare but you know mainly you're looking at the calling out of israel this is after the rapture of the church because she's done gone you know all right they have power to turn the water to blood and it's not the earth would all plagues as often as they will and when they shall i finish their testimony the beast that sent us out of the bottomless pit she'll make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them they're going to kill those two witnesses all right and their dead bodies run around said one time said see they won't even allow them to bury them is it their dead body shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called sodom and egypt where also our lord jesus was crucified okay where's that jerusalem all right and they are the people in kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves and now watch what they do they they dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them what about somebody killing somebody i mean can you think about it in any form i mean any form of religion or would there be any form of religion that you could understand that no matter what you are buddha hindu methodist baptist presbyterian catholics or whatever brown amounts or whatever in the world how could it be that you could rejoice over somebody being killed and you claim to be religious now what kind of a spirit would that be see those those jews they have no uh um feelings you know see they was ready to kill they they killed a lot of them they killed a lot of the christians the jews did you know because and they killed jesus christ why because he's done good now what kind of a religious form of salvations or whatever you would want to talk about where could you have anything like that that you'd want to kill somebody and yet it says here that they rejoice over the fact that those two witnesses are killed do you know they said it was said of some people like the and die got killed that our enemy is now dead now what kind of a religion would you have who would want any form of a religion that would even consider the fact of killing somebody and it'd be okay you don't think like that i mean you don't read your bible thinking about a horrible situation that's in and oh no they wouldn't rejoice over they didn't put it in the newspapers and blast it to the world when brother brown got killed and but i wonder how many would kind of sneaker up their sleeves even if some of us sarcastic old goatee granddaddy preachers that stood with this message if we pass off the scene but i just wonder what kind of a religion you have i don't want it i'm just honest a religion that would allow you to kill somebody in the name of your god you say without brother dale god killed people okay he told them to kill people okay but now where's the new testament for remember that's the way you separate the old in the new testament right in the old testament they would kill for what they believed in the new testament you're not supposed to kill for what you believe it would prove you wasn't in the new testament so anybody would rejoice over the death of anyone else because if they differed with them then i don't believe they've got any salvation well you have no right i don't care about what you think of my right is i'm killing what i think what do you think you think it's all right to go out and kill people because they're different with you well why does people kill you with their words we'll get off of that but listen they that dwell upon the earth will rejoice make mary send gifts one to another because the two prophets these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth but you know what now watch from here to here and going on down all right and after three days and a half the spirit of life of god from god entered into them and they stood up on their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them oh yeah and they heard a great voice from heaven sailing to them coming here that's ended up in the heaven and a cloud and their enemies beheld them and let's see them right now and they're going to change their ideas in the same hour there was a great earthquake in the 10th part of the city fell in the earthquake there's a slain of men seven thousand and the remnant were frighted and gave glory to god to the god of heaven up here you're saying kill them but now you're afraid you see that's where we're brought around people run their mouths but they wouldn't run them while he was alive they were under their mouth now about all this at the other but what would happen for him to stand back there you think you changed people's ways of doing well i remember in the old testament that nature and waves are worth it one day earth swallowed up i believe it was 250 preachers and the next day the people came to moses and you know what they said you killed the people of god most honest i've always been i hope i'm a christian it would have been tempting even as a christian to just back up and say god you just take care of it i'm not gonna have anything to do but i don't remember but but this is getting to be awful mess you better believe i'd remind them every day for the 40 years they was in a wilderness journey you know every day somebody come up and said boys get mad i say shut up you're the one who brought this you the costume and ain't being hateful and don't want to kill nobody we just won't tell it like it is but you look now look at verse four eleven verse fourteen put it back up right here now remember this is in the tribulation period right and we're talking about it see it says and the second woe is christ and behold the third woe cometh quickly now in revelations 6 13 i believe it is it says there's three woes or 8 13 somewhere in there all right revelations 9 and 12 it says that woe number one is taking place here we read in 11th chapter 14 verses the second woe was passed all right now we don't have to worry about what they are because we know what the prophet said go to number two this is the third angel's message to the world i won't deal with that now the third angel that'll be another message later on 14th chapter i think and you know what the third angel's message is going forward now in this day now we'll get down to that when we do it this is the flying of the third angel message if you're a bible reader see that was during his time i'll get back to that in the scripture there were three wolves followed it first one happened in world war one second one out of world war ii you know what we're going in now all right we're at the end of the road all right so world war one was woe number one world war ii was woe number two and world war ii preceded or came before the tribulation period and that's why when it got down to the scripture there and the second woe was passed because you're already into the tribulation with the two witnesses world war ii it done ended back in the 40s there all right but think about it why would you want to be so religious until you want to kill and do different things he goes on down true we won't get back into it we'll just jump over to the 12th chapter because i just want to bring those couple of little points with the 11th chapter now let's go into the to the revelations 12. if you can pull that up brother then we'll read this a little bit and then we'll get started on it they don't have that one actually wrote down for for doings for revelations 12. but i want to just get a point now and we'll get started on revelation 12. i just wanted to finish that up of revelations 11. no and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his head heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and then cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered parted over her child as soon as it was born all right so now you're back into what you're looking at is what we we we're calling when we're in the seal book is going through the the things in the bible are the symbols but letting the prophet tell us these symbols or if you read scofield and he has some good points upon the line of these things and in his footnotes and bringing it out but there's no way he could tie together the points that the prophet of god would put in there because we look at this and we think about this as being and wondering where it took place all right and we'll prove in a moment that this was when jesus christ was born all right but now you've got some things as said by the prophet that it's very confusing and i've got to bring that point to be able to drop back up on the other so look at number three on your notes and look at the surprising thing of when he says revelations 12 is to take place if you can't see a compound meaning for scriptures then it doesn't make no difference you understand the symbols if you don't understand the meaning go ahead number three this is the future home paragraph 48 verse 15. later on the lord willing we come into the twelfth seasons are not pardon me the twelfth chapter of revelation which lays between the coming of the lord and the ending of the trumpets all right now to take that statement by itself you would be telling the truth if you would say this was jesus christ being born but see it's a double meaning a compound meaning scriptures have compound meanings to them and wrote around these called a compound revelation one time but compound meanings in other words it can be saying one thing and have actually two meanings to that that won't be true meanings like uh white dog black dog you know they'll both tie together and make a beautiful picture once you see it see you've got to remember now this is what we're looking at the prophet would say then the prophet is going to come and say this is jesus christ see no wonder people can't understand brother branham you know because like i said any doctrine that you've got any thoughts you have any doctrinal idea or thought you have you name it and i can give you a quote that sounds contrary but i don't believe it's contrary now we're not talking about a white horse rider in a situation like that that's the prophet said he was wrong and he corrected but i'm talking about where he'll say that that baptism of the holy ghost is the new birth placing you in the body of christ giving you eternal life and in a minute he'll say you need eternal life you just got to sanctification or something you say i can prove that the new birth is believing on the lord jesus christ now i'm just making the points because the point is forget you to say something the message is not that confused it's our confusion that's right now like i said oral roberts university you could ask me and what did brother branham say about revelations 12. and they said well we've got this quote and we got these quotes so it looks like he is confused well that's pretty well the way the people are the messages isn't it they say well which one do you want you know and people have become so uh religiously revelated you call it not holy ghost but religiously until any time you say something they've automatically got that other quote you know pop them at you like popcorn i say what about this what about it well it sounds different from what this says but no it's not different the light just ain't shined on the subject yet for you to understand it that's right all right you you get the point there's worth now you don't matter what you think about me anyway about what i say i am because i ain't nothing anyway but that's where your teacher comes in to take the two sides and put them together right right because the others will just take it and run this away they'll run that away and hit and miss and up and down but a real true teacher he'll take that and ponder over it until he can see it come together right now and we can see then what paul would say looking like to those people that you know you're justified by faith well james would come along and it sounds like to most people's thinking that james says you're justifiable works and you know what both of them's right right but if it ain't put together you sure got a lot of problems right because we're born again by faith but then our works must follow our faith and if works don't father there's no faith so they're both saying the same thing you guys work right around said then it takes somebody to sit down and look at something until it'll come together and then you can see well hey there was right revelations 12 happens between the the you know the coming of the lord and the ending of the trumpets and that's going over that away still yet what but then when you look at revelations 12 you say i don't understand that because of what this says all right so let's take it a little bit you'll see that it'll come together revelation 12 would be israel right not the bribe she's gone in the rapture revelation 12 would be israel all right so now watch it deal with israel in what we read in the scriptures and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clove of the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered now watch what he says these things are so let's go to number four this is a message mark of the beast 54 513 i grabbed 130 and 131 too big now watch him describe he's talking about revelations 12. look the moon under her feet the sun in her head the moon under her feet the sun was the dispensation of grace and the moon was the dispensation of law now that's describing those two things and what it is you know the moon and the stars the woman was the orthodox church and she was standing over the law which is israel the old testament the orthodox israel the old testament all right and she was standing over the law the law was passing away because the law was a shatter of good things to come is that right the moon is only a shadow of the sun reflecting on the moon is that right making the moon and the law was under her feet she done lived through that day he said notice how she's dressed look and the church is crowned with the doctrine of the 12 apostles and look what he says that is and under her feet and upon her head a crowd of 12 stars see the old testament gave not only birth to jesus christ it gave birth to the word which was jesus christ right all right now giving birth to the word then the twelve apostles would come in one day i've got a message one of these days i told my wife and aaron about it the other day and i never told anybody only those two people and when they said i'll get back and preach on it because we've totally left out a lot of things about israel that needs to be covered and i'll get back to it when i get more over into whatever or whenever it comes up but look and she being with child controversy birth and pain to be delivered that was the orthodox church the old testament now what's going on the orthodox church is standing there the sun shining down the doctrine of the twelve apostles you realize those twelve apostles is the crown of the old testament law them and their message they brought their doctrine came from the old testament that's why paul would take the book of hebrews and tie it together and give you the symbols and the ways the thing read the book of hebrews no watch what he said saying now with the moon under her feet below the shadow of things to come the gospel light shining now the law faded away when the sun came up come out all right now watch what he's talking about she was pain to be delivered and she brought forth a man child which was christ jesus and he was caught up to god put it soon here it is as soon as the dragon verse 4 i believe it is 3 4 which was natural rome now hold on what you're talking about it's not the catholic church that come into being yet we've got to get down to where we can cover the powerful rome becoming pagan rome becoming papal rome when we get time but you see who was the fellow that wanted to kill jesus when he was born not pilate herod because they was looking for a king right herod was overroam right then pagan rome will become palpa wrong all right she was praying to be delivered see what you're doing is a compound meaning see they gave birth to jesus christ all right now when it comes to the end time because i tried to cover the other day on the feast of the trumpets were that leviticus 16 was a killing but leviticus 23 is a mourning for the kill see israel is going to give birth we've got to give birth so now you got three meanings to coming forth come on follow with me what i'm saying here it is as soon as the dragon which was the devil saw the woman ready to be delivered he stood right by her the virus child as soon as it was born and when jesus was born the roman emperor issued a proclamation to slay all the children from two years of age down begin to kill christ jesus and god pulled the world over his eyes and he took him down into egypt and hit him as he did moses the same way now so now we got a compound meaning of revelations 12 coming into view that one meaning is after the rapture of the church israel is going to bring forth christ through those two witnesses god is and they're going to preach it so straight until that 144 000 will produce christ not just uh two witnesses not just by themselves brother brown says that brother richard wilson overtake the other day talking about it but it runs says that that brings forth a mighty 144 thousand i mean those two witnesses is not always going to be fighting over at the end of this time the two witnesses are killed they're raptured up 144 000 is killed and they got to be taken up somewhere because they wind up in the millennium all right what's your prophet saying so but you see church what we're trying to do is take the symbols look at the symbols see what the symbols are but placing it because what would you do if you just come over here in the end time and said revelation 12 is from the rapture the bride you know i'm going up and and then it's all the issue he you wouldn't be able to see the man child you wouldn't know nothing about revelations 12. see so revelation 12 drops all the way back 2 000 years ago and you can see back there that those old testament saints gave birth to jesus christ and then he was taken up before they could kill him jury come back being it wasn't wrong that killed him right it was a jews that finally killed him right now we know that roman punishment had to happen we understand because it all had to be wrong that's why it has to come through rome run around south give me on the feast of the trumpets the other day where he said it's the same old spirit the natural rome was the same old spirit the natural rome tried to kill jesus christ when he came herod sent out the crime killed all the babies and things but god took that woman and you know joseph and mary and he went down to egypt now watch it in a minute when we get on down a little further you'll see that he provides a place in the end time for that 144 thousand to flee to for a while but then they're killed where are you listening now and there appeared another great wonder in heaven verse 3. and behold a great red dragon well let me let's finish number four we never get all of it on number four i don't think dude yeah okay remember number four number five going to number five we finished with four now watch and when jesus was born the red dragon in heaven stood at the woman to devour her child as soon as it was born the red dragon in heaven what are you talking about brother brown see we're gonna find out in a minute that sin started in heaven right then start on earth satan didn't become the devil on earth he become the devil in heaven rome watch what he's saying and when jesus was born the red dragon in heaven stood at the woman to devour a child as soon as it was born is that right it was it tried to devour christ when it was born congregation says wrong see there's the red dragon here's your prince here's your bc there they are every one of them just to sign him devour the child god called it up into heaven to sit on this throne that's where christ is now until the time of appointed seed so he took him up after he come forth and was crucified he went up but he didn't go up as a baby what are you listening now should we get it together who is that great red dragon verse 3 talking about wrong look hate powerful pagan rome which was a natural roman government you understand what i'm saying the natural roman government tried to kill jesus christ when he was about two years old it started towards a spiritual condition through the jews and the third part of the stars we'll read in a minute with those people that stood there and said let his blood be on us see making a compound meaning out of it that it can be over here but it starts back there that's what i've tried my best to get you to see about the seals and the things like that the seals don't break until after the rapture of the church in a literal extent will we see where they start even before the foundation of the world when sin started in heaven and we can look at it and see the day that we're living all right so what did he say in verse 3 there appeared another wonder in heaven behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his head now the seven horns is the city i don't have time to get back to that for seven horns is the city that sits on seven hills the ten crowns are ten kingdoms they don't have a king they have a dictator so look where you're at now when eisenhower and khrushchev met eisenhower means iron and khrushchev means clay that was your ten toes of daniel which is the same thing as revelations and brother around says they receive i got this wrote down to get later on they won't get it but he said see those crowns he said they are not kings he said they're dictators that receive power for a time and this is what he said about it you think he said look at those countries all of them little countries wanting to line up with communism you look at cuba and all these countries but just remember the ten toes of daniel was iron and clay and when it was when they met there there was five western and five eastern countries met the ten crowns met back there so it's already happened we're wondering what these crowns means that's what i'm dealing with wonder what these heads are that's what we're dealing with get you to see it's already happening it's not some big old monster we talk about the beast remember some big old monster walking across the earth boy look at that beast that's that's that beast in the bible no it's got to be something religious deceiving because look at your next verse verse 4 and his tale drew the third part of the stars of heaven and it cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered ordered the barber child as soon as it was born now listen what your prophet said look at number six you know what that was now his tail wasn't like a forking tail like you say the devil's got what was it it was that tail that lie that he told now once the very jews by the roman empire crucified the lord jesus and over two-thirds of the jews denied jesus christ and the stars which were in heaven and watch what he did he cast them to the earth so we're looking for stars angels this and that and whatever when the prophet explains derek calvary they believed that lie that tale that satan told that jesus wasn't god what are today well he wasn't really god he's just a demon god and he's a he become god and then he lost being god and he went back being a man finally died i disassembled the old jewish fable if i was gonna go that way but are you following me symbols being broken by a prophet to tell us what simple things they mean and yet we're looking for some kind of a do it you know what i've done years ago when when brother brown explains these things i hope you can see it just a little bit on the screen on my bible i wrote down what these things mean you know why because i believe he was a prophet and then did somebody come along and say well brother dale what is that red dragon see it's wrong they said well how do you know that well the prophet said it was see we didn't have the computer to be able to say okay hold on a minute there it is we had to make our own you ever sit for hours and try to copy a tape verbatim i wish you'd do it now sit down sometimes if you want to see what fun was in our day when we begun sit down with your tape player and copy what brother brown said you know hand write it as you listen to it you better believe you're gonna hear about five words and you're gonna cut it off all right no matter how good these topics are they're going to miss a lot of it the way they run around and talk try but you try to hand write it you'll see that we spent hours writing quotes off because of what people were saying well who knows what this means brother said where's that at you remember what i told that father one time i said something he said i don't know whether he said that or not i said i'll give you the place numbers don't go look at your book i said i'll make a deal with you if that's not what he said you call me back i'll put a sign on my back say i'm a false prophet lying devil you know what he didn't call me evidently he might have went and looked or even didn't care about looking either one i was just showing him how serious i was about it do you ask me something right around and said i'm going to tell you do you bet do the best i can to tell you what he's saying then that way it's not my opinion if it is i'll tell you about it you see when you start saying brother brown said this is what this means this is what that means this is what that means the only thing that i've done tonight is say by showing you revelations 12 as being after the rapture of the church and all and revelation 12 dealing with one drop to four has told you about this meaning and that meaning and both of those are same because you see this couldn't happen over here in the revelations if that hadn't happened back time you agree it could have took place so what is the lie the tale that satan told and it took two-thirds of the jews and made them deny jesus christ the stars which was in heaven come on they had a representative in heaven and the stars fell stars as sons right you need those i try to cut it down as much as i can but do you need me to show that the stars are the sons of god he said the sons of god can't fall anybody got a mirror would you mind taking it out and looking at it you fail so don't think nothing about them falling and that's what we've done we fell for the lie that satan is cold right and he's still in that sideline that he told eve in the garden right you won't die you'll be his gods he said he's still telling the same lie today well you don't need to know these things well what do we need to know this book of revelations well well when you said we're going to go up 4-1 but i think we can find a lot of things in here that are very valuable at least if nothing else to find out what the symbols mean to get away from those big headed things we used to think they were remember the other day when we were talking about the the beast that had a hair long hair you know and boy this the brother and said men with long hair to torment the women because of cutting nerves off yeah we're looking for some kind of a great who understands what leaders yeah and that's his lie that he's telling you the prophet told the truth look what he says who is this when you're talking about the devil look at number seven you say the dragon had something to do with the jews now remember the dragon comes all over rome right apple rum but remember the jews were under captivity to the natural romans you said the dragon had something to do with the jews certainly they said this jesus says he's the king we have no king but caesar that's right see the devil preparing them jewish hearts back there to deny jesus christ when he come can you see the devil denying hearts today to deny the power of the holy ghost when he come just exactly the same yes honest and sincere but you're deeply and but if you're deeply and seek after god like some of them jews did they walked right out and received him anyhow that's right they didn't care what the church said but it cost two-thirds of them it cast two-thirds of them to the ground and the dragon stood before the woman to devour the child as soon as it was born now who stood be what government what power stood before the woman the jewish orthodox church now you can see he's done got rome together as a natural government and the orthodox church now let me say it this way where you won't get confused the orthodox church the jews that gave birth to jesus christ didn't reject jesus christ come on the true jew that's what your prophet just got through saying get honest and sincere but if you seek after god received that's the way they did the dragon stood all right where's that the devil denying their hearts you got in their hearts to deny jesus christ when they come yet the same yet honest and sincere if you're deeply sick after god like some of them jews did they walk right out and receive him the old orthodox church as we call it all of it didn't receive jesus christ he was trying to crucify christ but at the same time they were trying to crucify christ there was at least 12 that had already accepted jesus christ not as a new birth because he had not been crucified but the twelve apostles we was reading one ago would be the crown in the woman's head see so now do you see the difference the orthodox church gave birth to jesus christ but israel as a natural people never gave birth to jesus christ do you understand i don't know why that would even have to be preached on but that's where people miss it at seemingly just because you don't explain everything to a detail and you're doing all you can to explain it for things with detail but listen church no more than the bride down to the ages was all the bride there was an elected bride the rest of them were part of the church right and turned and proved it by becoming a catholic church a baptist methodist or brahmites me are you listening some of them accepted jesus christ they never fell for satan's lie it was the two-thirds that listened to it lie they crucified jesus christ because they got power you've fallen on down the orthodox church through divine crime the orthodox church put jesus to death but the romans had to okay right you had to do it because the jews had no that you know the story of what it is they were in captivity they had rights of all of their laws except one thing they could not kill a man they just got by a lot of times by stoning people they did kill a lot of people but they just thrown them to death to take a change and the roman government says we don't want to cause no trouble so okay they got rid of one of them guys see the roman government and the jewish church was dealing hand in hand to crucify christ it was not roman soldiers that captured jesus in the garden right you know that it was the jewish guards of the temple what roman soldiers that went out there and got jesus the romans went in who would took him away from my favor hadn't been such a big mess but come on in the time we get to believing and read the book and find out the prophet said these things i don't bo it don't bother me at all to preach the people i love to preach to people that know what the prophet saying but what i hate to preach to is third grade education bunched it but he said this but he said to him making him a false prophet why did he say it this way i don't know ask him but listen do you understand what i'm trying to bring i know i'm getting lengthy on him that wrong that revelations 12 will be after we get out of here because like israel of the old testament gave birth to jesus christ all right the real true jews the 12 apostles would say even just that much would be the crowning glory of the old testament because they came into the new testament and would bring the doctrine of jesus christ because they were with him all the time and that would be your old orthodox church bringing forth christ but not all israel the other part of israel tried to kill me right over here in the end time after we get out of here the old natural israeli government israel is a nation they're going to go back to making daily sacrifices but that 144 000 then two witnesses gonna try to tell them they're gonna try to tell them who jesus christ is and they're gonna kill them because of that just as they kill jesus christ the same old roman devil and over here it's going to be called catholics and protestants now well okay go back and read the fourth seal and find me one country run around named under that four seal that would be coming down to fight against israel come on i want one country one one place that he says russia or china son now when he gets over to armageddon he says catholics and protestants because that's where they are they're all over the world rome i mean the whole whole world is under that system and it'll be catholics and protestants coming to fight against israel but not against the natural nation of israel because the natural nation of israel will be in an antichrist covenant they will be fighting against 144 000 and the two witnesses right they kill those two witnesses and god raises them up in a rapture they'll finally kill 144 000 according to the revelations when it's the fifth seal where it said until your brethren are killed also as you were and 144 000 are going to be killed you see today those two prophets are going to bring jesus christ so much on the scene to those forty four thousand they say where did you get the nail prints in your hand you think that ain't gonna be giving birth it won't be giving birth to a baby the israel of all gave birth to a baby this true jews are going to give birth to jesus christ a full grown man one like unto the son of man the scripture says where are you following me are we going to listen to the lie tales let's go on down go to go to verse five brother you got it on there i know we were pulling these up while ago and i didn't tell them to bring up a certain one so go to revelation 12 5 let's read it let's do that before we get down to number eight okay and she brought forth a man-child see all right the dragon stood before the woman was ready to deliver the divine child as soon as he was born okay and she brought forth a man-child who was ruled the nation with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god and to his throne that's two thousand years between the difference in coming into his throne into being and back there work started and it's 33 years between his birth and him trying to kill him with the natural romans and being taken up to his throne once and the lord fled into the wilderness where she hath the place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and three score days what is that three and a half years tribulation now you jump two thousand years just between one or two verses you've jumped three thousand two thousand years but now you know what that number is now and watch what's the compound meaning of this now verse seven and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any their place found any more in heaven michael and his angels thought were lucifer six thousand years ago amen right that's just time of day in the day because sin began in heaven right and dropped down to earth so what did he go up to the dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil the satan which deceived the whole world he was cast out of the earth his angels were cast out with all right 12 10 lord lives a little where might he see and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is salvation and strength in the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brother and is cast down who excuses them before our god day and night two thousand years six thousand years between the two michael and lucifer fight in heaven satan is cast out brought around said come to earth and start it in the garden of eden right it's gonna be cast out again he's going to be cast out again let's read a couple of these and then we'll have to squeal again look at number eight and abby was playing a while ago from a little contraction come off again this is questions and answers 54 103 the morning service the 12th chapter revelation the woman standing in the sun the red dragon put his tail around two-thirds of the stars now we don't see who's that the jews it was cast down pull them down to earth we realize that satan in the beginning set up a kingdom in the north lands to be more beautiful than what the than what the michaels was and there was a day when he declared war in heaven and he pulled two thirds of the angelic beings with him is that right all right look at a day the unfailing realities of living god remember sin didn't begin on earth then began in heaven when lucifer taken and made him he said i want a denomination make a great big thing went on the north country and set up a bigger thing that michael had and he was kicked out of heaven now if that's not compound where are you going with it he was kicked out back there you see the meaning he was kicked out back there he's going to be kicked out again in the end right you're going to be kicked out here in the end time now you don't have to wait over there a long way you need to be kicked out we know michael is christ everybody understand that the beginning of the gentile dispensation number nine michael shall stand the great prince michael was christ of course who fought the angelic wars in heaven with the devil satan and michael thought to give our fought against each other rather than and at that time he said as many as were found written in the book but was delivered and those who had done righteous watch this now watch look at the next one this is one i like because see satan's going to be cast out in the end time now do you remember reading over there where he said he's the accuser of the brethren now do you need do i need to spend on out of time you realize satan right now can go up there before god and accuse you of doing wrong and god looks at him and says i don't see it right i don't see it yeah but they don't switch on he said i don't see it and like i've always said you know we cry and pray to try to get an audience from god the devil can go see him every day that's hard no more a lot to think about but you see it's the way god set it up he permits him to come in there but you know what i love the prophet to say like this he said will god listen to an angel or will he listen to a son of god right you realize we have a whole lot more power in heaven than satan ever thought about having we're going to have that on earth right but you know our problem is we don't believe it that's it we don't believe what god has made us and then we allow our everyday lives to interfere to where we can't walk where we need to walk and i said me and you all of us but you know that satan is he was cast out back here before the foundation of the world but he's going to be cast out again look at the next quote where let's see women let's go back a day i mean 9 excuse me back that one the first seal program 361. then in revelations 12 7-9 when satan has cast out the accuser i want you to put that down but i want to read it you haven't got time now because but in revelations 12 9 satan the spirit the devil which is up there now accuser of our brethren all right the church is taken up and satan is cast out now we're finding some great things to be placed in among these things about you and i when the church goes up satan comes down then satan incarnates himself in the antichrist and is called the beast what about that but do we need to know about these things well that right there just put that little point right in the middle i think would be worth three or four sermons of dullness of understanding the symbols and the quotes and the thoughts i call it bonus on your part not mine but you understand when we go up satan's coming out see god thanks so much of you satan can go up there now and accuse you but one day he will not be able to go to heaven and talk to god it's because you were there when that wife walked into that palace or walked into a rapture and what do you want to say satan is already cast out that's why the scripture said he had just a little season see he knows when he's cast out that ain't gonna be long he's gonna be destroyed that's why i always try to tell you the devil tells you that you're not this and you're not there tell him say well one of these days i'll be in eternity and you'll be destroyed then you don't have no hope you don't have to talk to it well these days you get honest enough you'll find out you talk to the devil a whole lot more you talk to god no no now bless god well why'd you stir it up that way you know it's true i don't talk to that devil well it may be true maybe he's already got you oh okay what do you understand when we go up he comes down right see according to the book of daniel the natural jew that michael will stand on his side and fight for him but you know what we are spiritual jews who do you think it is happening now i thought it was christ's name for glory i thought he was the one that was battling satan i thought he was the only one that knew how to handle satan and was michael that even the great gabriel that would be standing beside the lord and could deliver messages even to the birth of jesus christ but yet he wasn't able to handle satan in the book of daniel but christ kept on the scene and the battle was over christ is the one that's in your heart right now michael christ fighting the battle you're a couple of ones that's been in these car wrecks who do you think was in that car anna years ago had a wreck and tore a car up and she said it felt like she was floating on our in the car just like when she anything to touch it was just soft who do you think's on your side but you ever think about it you've talked to him see he's the one that can take care of satan that's right but he's not going to be cast out of heaven till we get there all right i don't have time to preach this point but if he's not cast out of this bride in the end time don't even worry about israel and all the symbols and the thoughts and ideas and what will be if he can't be if if christ can't cast satan out now out of your hearts and lies and minds and thoughts and things ain't going to be no in the bible this is the decisive battle that's right no it was fought out at calvary amen but we're still in these old bodies we're still under the curse in the body spirit part of man and there's a battle going on the greatest battle ever fought in the human mind when we go up satan's cast out because he can't be there where we're at that's how much god thinks of you well why can't we bring that battle down on earth and get on with it and just challenge the devil man set my home one time because i was telling him his brother was wrong and he said brother tell you why he said you correct that brother brother he said you'll become exalted don't you worry brother there's too many devils around and let me get exhausted as long as i don't join up with them i'm not gonna have any trouble i'm gonna have a battle but to find out who it was you know the devil used to be god's right hand man right he was the anointed cherub that stood beside the lord it was his right-hand man that's what i've always said about him he never could understand it he knew all of my angels he could call every name of those angels wormwood gabriel you could bring them all down satan could but one day there was one step out there that he didn't understand he knew he could handle gabriel which would be the top but one day somebody stepped out there and it was a battle not this kind you know boy just fighting no no i never have believed that i wonder what would be the matter with people's mind to make them think you mean supernatural beings fight battles you know touching each other silly demons but you see satan right now is attacking your mind it'll be according to what we do with it we decide to battle right whether we believe him or not that's right he was god's right-hand man but you just think about it him standing there and all at once one just steps out from god how else would you express it just steps out and he says let there be and the world comes into existence he just creates and he begins doing all the creating because according to my bible it says that jesus christ not jesus the flesh man jesus christ created all things according to my bible satan stood there and watched him doing all that creating and he said i can't do that i might be able to have these angels but i can't do that who is that and the bible calls him michael the prophet called in christ christ can battle i went to jamaica that time and i didn't know he had a song of it i preached on michael and christ and the things and they got up so i was ready to rejoice you know all over the place because they were singing the song you've heard it you know michael on your side listen church satan can't win we'll just stop on that cut up i got some more downs below but i want to bring i want to wait on it of revelations 12. but let me just talk about it a minute because every battle that's ever been fought has been between god and the devil that's right that's the bible it looks like after a while that the devil would realize he can't win but you see he keeps trying all again he's going to get everything he can he's going to be loose one of these days after the millennium and he's going to gather a great multitude and coming right back up to jerusalem again because he thinks he can whip god but what about the devil and all of his angels couldn't handle one man that was the man of christ jesus would never devil and hell loosed on jesus christ come on is it right well you know i thought maybe under that little bit of the feast of the trumpets i was trying to bring out that you'd remember that those demons it was loose to drive the jews to the homeland under hitler and eichmann and him 20 years later was released on the bride to drive her to the message of the hour you know what i do when i begin to feel down and out i start reading or listening to things what do you do let's go out with a pity party nobody don't love me well i just start reading because i know i've learned one thing about fighting satan when he's leaving me alone i got a problem because i can't figure out what he's doing but when i'm fighting i know where it's at sure it's in me but i know what he's doing but you see if he can be cast out of menu on this earth through justification sanctification the baptism when the holy ghost and a restored word of god then he'll be cast out of heaven because he ain't going to be there where you at what about a god that loves you so much he won't let satan be in your presence okay we want to defeat satan just get in the word you didn't start reading you're listening to tapes and things i mean what else is more important because we get to feel we get the word in the field don't worry about god quickening come on brother we'll continue to chapter 12 on the next message but the bride of jesus christ is so much god until satan can't handle her when he brought around say they said brother brown said you said that we could live so close to god until satan didn't know what to do with us now what's living close to god the prophet said pray and read your bible he said there's one thing about it we can do too much of this and we can do too much of that but he said we can't pray too much because he can't stand you now if you don't believe it if you can't understand what i'm driving at one of these days when we go up he's got to come down because he can't be there well if you don't understand there's sometimes when you're down and out and satan is beating you to death just start praying and calling jesus and thanking him and worship him and watch him leave right watch him leave you and all he wants everything just so happy you know you just well you know what you just done you just cast out satan come on how much do we need to get into it the prophet said what to cast out satan is to cast out unbelief well until truth is revealed there was no way no one could handle satan but i said we are as an individual not a match for the devil all right hey amen now let's get two meanings out of this compound i'm not no match for the devil and i realize that but i thought that i could find a quote that would say that you can live so close to god until the devil don't know what to do he okay which one we want to be you know we want to be the down and out and the bad at the mouth you know you know i found out a long time ago that the most down and out of the mouth you can get you know so bad you just start looking around and you'll find something a whole lot worse another day in the paper there you've had a couple of days you may have seen it about that boy that was in iraq i think it was a roadside bomb blowed up both legs off both arms how did you like life like that you know what they've done now they put two arms on and he said begin able to move he said i don't care about the legs he said because you just don't understand he's in today's fight so you don't understand sid if you got arms you can love and hug and feel you could just see the man's thoughts in his mind not lustful but to think about he could hug his mom you see church we get down and out start looking at something like that and start saying well lord i ain't that far down help me let's stand we'll take the rest of it and go on dealing with the remnant of the woman's seed and see everything has to have many meanings to it but not now listen please on the air listen not many meanings that are different i'm not talking about a junk many meanings but they all tied together into one beautiful picture you followed that through revelations five of revelation 12 and i you see the black yonder thing was happening you see satan was cast out before the world but you see he'll be kept out of the end time you see that that christ child was born back there in rome with third and desire you know this little ride you've got to give birth to jesus christ and it'll be this man child not a baby that goes to israel not a baby's going to israel is going to be a man child that comes from you and i your words not different meanings there's many ways of looking until it all comes together and you'll see brother around his message that he'll say one time this means this and he'll say another time this means this don't try to throw them away just leave it alone one day it'll come together looking like a beautiful pitch then you take the bible and read it and it looks just like over here that says this and over here and it says this that's what's going to cast satan out of heaven because it's casting them out of your mind now it's the revealed word of god anybody have a name me amen is and oh hey please often one to another and a book of remembrance is written what about what she's talking about talking about him talking about our savior just be careful on the way home the weather's still bad and let the lord take care of your father we ask you to just be with everybody give everybody a safe journey lord just got us all safely home let your love be with us thank you for the rain and the things that's come god we needed that and thank you for the protection that you've given us to guide each and every one of us we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to realize realization to be guided in your love in jesus name you just missed we
