[10:38] with the voice of thanksgiving
[10:41] i will pay that i have that that i have
[10:44] vowed
[10:45] salvation
[10:47] is of the lord now you know jonah was
[10:50] delivered then because of that salvation
[10:52] ephesians now
[10:57] according verse 4 according as he had
[10:59] chosen us in him
[11:00] before the foundation of the world that
[11:02] we should be holding without blame
[11:03] before him in love
[11:05] having predestinated us unto the
[11:07] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[11:10] himself
[11:11] according to the good pleasure of his
[11:13] will to the praise of the glory of his
[11:15] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[11:18] in the blood
[11:19] in whom we have redemption through his
[11:21] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[11:24] to the riches of his grace
[11:27] we're in he hath abounded toward us in
[11:30] all wisdom and prudence
[11:32] having made known unto us the mystery of
[11:34] his will according to his good pleasure
[11:36] which he hath purposed in himself
[11:39] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[11:41] of times he might gather together in one
[11:44] all things in christ both which are in
[11:46] heaven
[11:47] and which are on earth
[11:49] even in him
[11:51] in whom also we have obtained an
[11:53] inheritance
[11:55] being predestinated according to the
[11:57] purpose of him who worketh all things
[11:59] after the council of his own will that
[12:02] we should be to the praise of his glory
[12:04] who first trusted in christ in whom he
[12:08] also trusted
[12:09] after that you heard the word of truth
[12:12] the gospel of your salvation and whom
[12:15] also after that you believed you were
[12:17] sealed with that notice now with that
[12:20] holy spirit
[12:22] a promise
[12:23] all right not know half a dozen holy
[12:25] spirits it's that holy spirit
[12:27] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[12:30] until the redemption of the purchased
[12:31] possession
[12:32] unto the praise of his glory you may be
[12:35] seated lord at his blessing to the
[12:38] reading of the word
[12:43] good to see brother luis and his family
[12:46] back
[12:46] because we know that old flu bugs are
[12:49] striking everywhere and
[12:50] trying to do everything it can to hinder
[12:53] each one now i want to make a statement
[12:55] to you
[12:58] and i hope you'll listen to this
[13:00] statement
[13:01] and understand it
[13:02] see now to me the bible
[13:05] does not reveal a whole lot of things
[13:09] now listen very carefully
[13:11] he said well it revealed israel now the
[13:13] bible is the revelation of jesus christ
[13:18] all right now all the other is
[13:20] background
[13:22] a people that it was in
[13:24] a time that was on earth
[13:26] governments of this situation that
[13:29] situation all right so the bible is
[13:31] summed up
[13:34] with one point of saying the revelation
[13:37] of jesus christ personally to you
[13:41] and see that is
[13:43] the new birth
[13:45] all right now we'll get to that the lord
[13:47] willing maybe wednesday if we can but if
[13:50] not we'll catch our thought and move on
[13:53] all right but get the point now the
[13:54] bible doesn't reveal a dozen different
[13:56] things
[13:59] all right now it's a revelation of jesus
[14:01] christ so the bible now like wade is
[14:03] trying to emphasize a lot to us but
[14:06] listen to it the bible doesn't reveal
[14:08] the antichrist
[14:10] it reveals jesus christ and you see the
[14:13] antichrist going away
[14:18] you know
[14:18] riding away from you and understanding
[14:21] and things see that's what everybody's
[14:22] so confused about in the seals is they
[14:24] think the seals is revealing the devil
[14:28] now that's not according to your profit
[14:32] all right
[14:33] well i think it's revealing to satan in
[14:35] his way that is made known
[14:37] in opposition
[14:40] you've got your four combat beasts
[14:43] which is a line the oxaman the eagle
[14:46] then you've got four
[14:48] writers on the other side but that's not
[14:50] revealing
[14:53] the revealing of jesus christ is before
[14:55] combat beast so just remember the whole
[14:57] bible i'm writing a list and i will make
[14:59] a copy of it and i want everybody to
[15:02] keep it because i'm writing a list
[15:04] of
[15:05] things that are
[15:07] blunt statements
[15:10] all right
[15:12] and a blunt statement then
[15:15] everything else around has to be related
[15:19] to that
[15:22] okay just the statement i was making
[15:23] there from christ the mystery of god
[15:25] revealed brother brown said what is the
[15:27] new birth
[15:30] well the like i've told you
[15:33] emphasize what is the new birth it's a
[15:35] revelation of jesus christ personally to
[15:37] you
[15:38] that's what the prophet said on christ
[15:40] the mystery of god revealed all right
[15:41] but did you understand the emphasis i
[15:43] was making this past wednesday
[15:46] on the basis that there's the prophet
[15:48] said there's over 200
[15:52] denominational ways of understanding
[15:56] the new birth
[15:59] or born-again experience 200 i mean
[16:02] excuse me 900
[16:05] right
[16:06] 900 different ways
[16:13] you don't think about that
[16:16] like i said wednesday you don't consider
[16:17] the fact
[16:19] the world is not
[16:20] you know it's not that they're right
[16:22] over here preaching seals and plagues
[16:24] and vials and trumpets and
[16:27] they're trying to preach the new birth
[16:31] every denomination is trying to preach
[16:34] salvation right what's the purpose of a
[16:37] church or anything
[16:41] but yet
[16:43] they're all confused
[16:46] i didn't say that
[16:50] see
[16:51] we're going to get down one of these
[16:52] days to believing that brother branham
[16:54] was a prophet
[16:56] that the word of god could come to
[16:58] and then we're going to see that listen
[17:00] we're going to see this got to be the
[17:02] way he says it and there is no other way
[17:05] to say it
[17:09] there's no other way to say it
[17:11] because he said it
[17:13] what is the new birth brother branham
[17:15] okay
[17:16] well i believe the new birth is shouting
[17:18] speaking in tongues crying doing this
[17:20] seeing vision
[17:24] that's not the new birth
[17:28] now brother donny not talking about the
[17:30] other day riding down the hunt and
[17:31] landing back you know when a baby is
[17:33] born
[17:35] all right now you know what i'm talking
[17:37] about and we know the story that most
[17:39] babies are born starting off crying
[17:42] because what did the prophet call it the
[17:44] shock we could use the big word now
[17:46] trauma
[17:47] you know the trauma of the baby coming
[17:50] into the world starts it to crying
[17:53] and breathing but you know what it has
[17:55] to receive
[17:56] life into the baby
[17:59] after it exodus
[18:02] exits the mother's womb now are we right
[18:05] we're not talking about caesareans we're
[18:07] not talking about all the other garbage
[18:09] in a normal birth
[18:12] all right that baby when it comes forth
[18:17] the life into the baby makes the baby
[18:20] cry
[18:21] you say oh it was crying yes it was
[18:23] crying it's not a life until it comes
[18:25] forth
[18:26] and the soul is breathing to that child
[18:29] right
[18:30] that's what your prophet says
[18:33] well i think see that's what i'm saying
[18:35] you don't believe brother brown was a
[18:36] prophet
[18:37] you can't stay with the message with our
[18:40] thoughts and ideas when that baby is
[18:43] delivered
[18:46] it doesn't cry before it breathes
[18:51] it breathes the breath of life
[18:53] even if you have to spank it or whatever
[18:55] has to happen or the trauma of it being
[18:57] born or whatever when it comes forth it
[19:00] who
[19:02] then it cries
[19:05] crying is your attributes
[19:08] speaking in tongues shouting all of
[19:11] those are not the new birth
[19:14] those are after effects
[19:17] those are the attributes coming forth
[19:20] from that to work
[19:22] if we get that into our mind and settle
[19:24] it it'd be easier to understand the new
[19:25] birth right
[19:29] see you could understand why brother
[19:30] brown would say
[19:31] now listen
[19:33] brother branham what is the new birth
[19:36] christ the mystery mr god reveal
[19:39] he said it's a revelation of jesus
[19:40] christ personally to you
[19:44] well what's the new birth
[19:49] now he said it
[19:52] he said it's the revelation
[19:59] no we got shout out we got that let's
[20:00] see
[20:03] the emotional effects comes because the
[20:05] baby has breathed life
[20:14] see if you'd consider that it'd be a
[20:15] whole lot easier to understand the
[20:17] message
[20:18] like we're going to read again like we
[20:19] did wednesday they run around and said
[20:21] if their people understood the oneness
[20:23] of the godhead
[20:27] well you know what
[20:30] now forgive me
[20:31] i try to make emphasis so there's 900
[20:35] churches
[20:36] or situations trying to explain a new
[20:38] birth
[20:44] but if they understood the oneness of
[20:46] the godhead they wouldn't have any
[20:47] problem that's right
[20:48] and you know yourself the biggest
[20:50] portion of organized religion
[20:52] does not understand the oneness of the
[20:53] godhead ain't talking about oneness
[20:55] brother and said i need one i'm talking
[20:57] about he said i resent that
[21:00] amen i i i you never think anything
[21:04] about that but
[21:05] to me it was a wonderful thought to me
[21:08] that god could speak to us and say look
[21:12] the whole world is trying to preach
[21:13] salvation
[21:15] in one way or the other
[21:19] but the world is confused about the
[21:21] truth of it
[21:26] now did your prophet make it he said if
[21:28] you do have the new birth he said you
[21:30] can't deny the word
[21:32] that's right
[21:34] well why have they denied this message
[21:36] now we're not talking about people that
[21:38] ain't heard it we ain't talking about
[21:40] all of that so you get those blumps into
[21:42] your mind and it it kills the thought
[21:49] but random even said he said i don't
[21:51] believe we're getting the people to
[21:53] jesus christ
[21:55] he said we're getting them to a doctrine
[21:57] amen
[22:01] well
[22:04] but then you got to remember one other
[22:05] thing
[22:07] he said a church without a doctrine is
[22:09] not a shirt
[22:12] but see there's got to be a truth
[22:16] right
[22:17] but you know what everything you look at
[22:20] the pyramid behind me it comes up to a
[22:21] peak point
[22:24] everything from there down has to be
[22:26] built according to that
[22:30] right
[22:32] so this thing peaks somewhere in a
[22:34] revelation of jesus christ
[22:40] now watch that in a minute when the
[22:41] prophet we read what what is the
[22:44] baptism of the holy spirit
[22:47] all right when you ask him a question
[22:48] and he answers it
[22:50] why is there so much thoughts related
[22:53] around trying to figure it out
[22:56] when he tells you what it is
[23:06] that's one church
[23:07] i sit and listen and i try to comprehend
[23:12] but where is the simplicity
[23:16] why has it turned down the simplicity
[23:21] of the message your prophet brought
[23:25] i said the other day it's
[23:27] you need to worry about preaching seals
[23:29] vials plagues trumpets and stuff like
[23:31] that to the people of this message to
[23:33] try to you know straighten them out if
[23:36] we don't get the new birth correct
[23:38] we're not going anywhere
[23:42] if we don't know what the baptism of the
[23:44] holy spirit is we're not going anywhere
[23:47] can i read you a quote from brother
[23:48] branham where he says
[23:51] if we don't understand the baptism we
[23:54] can't get it
[23:59] if you don't know what it is you can't
[24:01] get it well it could just come down see
[24:08] what come
[24:12] three or four messages down the road but
[24:14] see you're still in all kind of feelings
[24:16] and when i when we read today and the
[24:18] prophet
[24:19] talks about the baptism of the holy
[24:21] spirit
[24:24] listen to what he's saying
[24:30] but we say baptism it means something
[24:32] got to come from up there
[24:35] down here
[24:37] baptism means some kind of a something
[24:40] flowing over us
[24:41] water
[24:43] we relate water baptism
[24:45] in spiritual baptism
[24:50] we don't read the bible
[24:52] we don't listen to the prophet
[24:56] read the book of acts
[24:58] sure it says in the room was filled
[25:00] but where was the holy ghost
[25:04] the prophet said a lick of fire said on
[25:06] each one of them he said the holy ghost
[25:07] was inside
[25:12] may i ask you another question these are
[25:14] written down for other sermons to come
[25:16] when elijah was in the cave
[25:20] what did it say about him
[25:24] it wasn't the thunder the lightning the
[25:26] clouds to do in the whirlwinds the thing
[25:29] what was it
[25:31] somebody say it what was it
[25:33] said a still small voice
[25:37] well i guess he's sitting over here a
[25:38] little voice over the corner and said
[25:40] elijah
[25:41] no no no
[25:43] it was inside of him
[25:44] [Applause]
[25:49] that's where we're missing it so all
[25:51] right listen
[25:54] so let's start if we can to the point
[25:56] to not back up a whole lot but we've
[25:58] covered salvation
[26:01] as being deliverance and we've covered
[26:04] that throughout the old testament
[26:07] and coming up even into the matthew mark
[26:09] luke and john which was still under the
[26:12] old testament and jesus was under the
[26:14] law he came to under the law redemption
[26:17] them that were under the law
[26:19] and he even told the people to go off
[26:21] for sacrifices of moses and things
[26:23] because the law was still in existence
[26:26] until
[26:29] the law didn't end at calvary
[26:35] it didn't end at calvary
[26:38] when the holy ghost came
[26:41] because my bible says christ is what
[26:45] the end of the law
[26:49] for
[26:50] righteousness
[26:52] right
[26:53] is that the scripture
[26:55] so the law ended
[26:57] when the holy ghost came and started a
[26:59] new covenant a new testament
[27:02] and you couldn't have the covenant
[27:03] without the death of the testator
[27:06] that's according to hebrews
[27:09] see
[27:10] all right then there's the simplicity of
[27:12] it
[27:14] it shouldn't be anything well i think
[27:16] it's see
[27:18] those are flat statements
[27:22] the bible said
[27:25] that the holy ghost had not been given
[27:27] because jesus had not been crucified or
[27:29] glorified that which one is using it
[27:31] is that scripture
[27:32] amen well you know then where is there
[27:34] any argument or a thought
[27:37] that you have any other concept about
[27:39] the holy ghost than that
[27:44] well i think it's this over here i think
[27:45] see that's denominationalism
[27:50] that's thoughts of mankind
[27:53] the bible said it
[28:00] i see what was it he said one time i
[28:03] i would think of it in a minute brother
[28:04] brown was saying he said well we think
[28:06] about anything else he said the bible
[28:07] said it
[28:09] what do we think of anything else in the
[28:10] bible says it's just one god
[28:13] what does one of the commandments say
[28:16] the lord thy god is one
[28:19] well
[28:22] why we got all of these doctrines and
[28:23] ideas about it
[28:26] turn up the volume a little bit josh
[28:28] because i'm not my voice don't run too
[28:30] good
[28:31] and some of the sisters needs it a
[28:33] little better
[28:35] all right but listen
[28:37] so in the old testament we spoke of
[28:39] salvation as a
[28:42] deliverance to where that it preserved
[28:45] them and kept them
[28:47] and pointed to calvary and produ and
[28:50] went forward to calvary
[28:52] all right
[28:53] but then after calvary then on the day
[28:56] of pentecost you started the new
[28:58] testament the new covenant
[29:00] the new birth came into being the
[29:03] born-again experience came into being
[29:05] the baptism of the holy spirit came into
[29:07] being and we're going to read in a
[29:09] minute that the new birth the baptism of
[29:11] the holy ghost
[29:13] and the born-again experience is the
[29:14] same thing
[29:17] no i think you said i got a quote from
[29:19] brother branham so he's okay you start
[29:21] quoting those things to me
[29:24] we're going to really quote
[29:27] because you're gonna you're gonna as i
[29:29] said today you're gonna get so upset
[29:31] with me about this thing pretty quickly
[29:33] it's gonna do something and i'm just as
[29:34] serious as i can be in a crying in my
[29:36] heart
[29:37] because we're gonna nail it down to
[29:39] where there ain't no
[29:40] way
[29:41] if you get up and say i think it's so
[29:43] i'm going to tell you sit down and shut
[29:45] up that's what eve said you have no
[29:47] right to think then you're going to get
[29:49] mad at me
[29:51] so you think i'm hateful when i'm trying
[29:54] to save your soul
[29:57] your kid's out in the road well honey i
[29:59] wish you'd get out of the road
[30:02] huh
[30:04] come on no
[30:06] it's screaming and hollering
[30:08] all right
[30:09] so we come to
[30:10] in our thoughts we come up to
[30:14] the point of talking about the baptism
[30:16] of the holy spirit
[30:19] all right
[30:20] now what is your thoughts of the baptism
[30:23] of the holy spirit
[30:32] see we'll get back to these statements
[30:38] what did the prophet say
[30:41] he said one of the mysteries of the last
[30:43] days
[30:46] was to receive the baptism of the holy
[30:48] spirit without
[30:50] a sensation
[30:54] you need that jonah can pull it in a
[30:56] hurry but if you need it
[31:00] but you know what he never taught
[31:03] the new birth anywhere without an
[31:04] experience
[31:05] he never taught the baptism of the holy
[31:07] ghost without an experience he never
[31:09] taught the new birth or born again or
[31:11] anything without an experience
[31:14] but without a sensation
[31:20] i know this is way ahead because i'll
[31:22] repeat it coming back across
[31:24] but what about the man that found the
[31:26] track
[31:29] i'd like for you or your computers to go
[31:31] home and run that in it and you'll find
[31:34] brother random five times explaining
[31:37] that man and more than six or seven more
[31:41] as parts explaining you know what
[31:42] mentioned in it
[31:47] and that man picked up that track
[31:50] and read it
[31:52] but read what he says the man doing
[31:55] see we think the man read the track and
[31:56] he went down and he just played along
[31:58] brother didn't say that
[32:00] that man got deadly serious
[32:03] he got so serious he said he supported
[32:05] all the preachers he gave his money away
[32:07] he said i had a half a million dollars
[32:10] and sold all my cars and said i got no
[32:11] junk now
[32:16] whenever were to everything
[32:20] speaking in tongues shouting went to
[32:22] every one of them
[32:24] and they finally told him said you need
[32:25] to go to william branham because he's a
[32:27] prophet and he can discern out he come
[32:29] to brother branham and
[32:33] run around and listen to him talk a
[32:35] minute of his life
[32:40] and he said
[32:44] you don't need
[32:46] anybody to do this or shout at it he
[32:49] said what you need to do is just plain
[32:50] language what he said you need to sit
[32:52] down and listen
[32:54] and the guy said in other words what
[32:56] literally said do you remember he picked
[32:57] up that track
[33:04] now i didn't make the statement brother
[33:06] random i know makes it four times i'm
[33:08] pretty sure five and maybe six or seven
[33:11] because i know they assumed that they're
[33:12] just part statements of this point
[33:15] the man said you mean i got it right
[33:17] there he said yes
[33:20] you got it right there
[33:27] but you see we know all about the new
[33:29] word
[33:32] and brother random told him all of those
[33:34] things and one of the statements he said
[33:35] all those things you've done was good
[33:39] he said we believe in shout out we
[33:41] believe in this we believe in speaking
[33:42] in tongues
[33:48] he said but
[33:50] but you got it back there
[33:52] he said when you become
[33:54] to that point he said you become
[33:56] converted
[34:02] well
[34:04] maybe we were to think a little bit
[34:06] about all of this instead of all this
[34:07] emotional side of everything
[34:12] but just remember there's other
[34:13] statements from brother branham he said
[34:16] uh
[34:18] what they called it about a baby born
[34:20] with no life he said it's a dead baby
[34:22] he said anywhere the holy ghost comes
[34:24] it's going to be
[34:26] life
[34:32] but that ain't the holy ghost
[34:35] that's because of something happening in
[34:37] you
[34:41] i wish we could get that down
[34:44] and just listen to it you say well i
[34:46] think we do brother i do but
[34:52] okay let's start off
[34:54] so we got up to talking about
[34:57] we read these things we will re-read
[34:59] them as we're going in to it
[35:03] but we got into the point of talking
[35:04] about why we changed this title of the
[35:07] service and what sermons
[35:09] we were talking about salvation
[35:11] and using that as an old testament form
[35:14] and using it as deliverance
[35:16] and having it as a tops in the shadows
[35:19] you know of the new testament
[35:22] but what they had back there in the old
[35:24] testament did not bring them eternal
[35:26] life so if you brought what they had in
[35:28] the old testament to the new testament
[35:30] and left it without jesus christ
[35:33] you'd have the same people
[35:35] and that's what the world has done
[35:38] they've left jesus christ out of their
[35:42] birth it's the same as you know that's
[35:45] when i i scream i know
[35:48] and i'm sorry
[35:51] i was screaming i listen to that message
[35:52] twice i screaming
[35:56] you say well i believe
[35:58] abraham
[35:59] was going to offer his child
[36:03] that's the believer that we claim to be
[36:05] standing upon as the father of our faith
[36:08] right
[36:19] he'd make a real good believer today
[36:21] wouldn't he
[36:24] when he gonna take his son out and kill
[36:26] him
[36:26] because god said it
[36:32] it's your hate for him to tell me to do
[36:33] that
[36:37] i'm serious
[36:39] but listen
[36:44] we come up to this statement
[36:47] we ended it right around speaking in the
[36:48] third seal
[36:51] and he's talking about coming to the
[36:54] baptism of the holy ghost and he said
[36:56] they had to go up to pentecost
[36:59] and wait
[37:01] that's where we ended at had to go to
[37:03] the pentecost and wait
[37:07] right then the holy ghost came
[37:10] and that fulfilled acts
[37:13] right 1-8
[37:16] where jesus had told them during acts
[37:18] 1-8
[37:19] you shall receive power after the holy
[37:21] ghost has come upon you
[37:23] and you'll be my witnesses sometimes
[37:25] he said all right
[37:28] because they didn't have it
[37:31] well i never heard anybody teach
[37:32] anything like that well
[37:37] is it the truth
[37:41] well i thought that saved back ain't
[37:43] nobody said them people back i wouldn't
[37:45] save i never taught nothing like i
[37:47] didn't teach that in the baptist church
[37:49] i thought they were saved
[37:52] but i knew in the baptist church that
[37:53] jesus christ had not died
[37:56] and then without the death of the
[37:58] testator you couldn't have a new
[37:59] covenant i knew the book of acts
[38:02] was the first book in the new testament
[38:04] i didn't have to read matthew because
[38:05] you asked most people what's the first
[38:07] book of the new testament they'll go to
[38:08] matthew matthew's still under the law
[38:11] the book of acts is the first
[38:14] of the new
[38:16] testament you see we would have read
[38:19] those things
[38:20] all right
[38:21] see they were great believers
[38:23] they were justified they were set aside
[38:27] and brother branham says that when they
[38:29] i'm paraphrasing a quote that he gave he
[38:31] said they actually when they repented of
[38:33] their sins he said that cleanse that
[38:35] that took away from their sins he said
[38:37] but then before jesus would send them
[38:40] out he said they got to sanctification
[38:46] he said when they come to sanctification
[38:48] then jesus sent them out
[38:52] to preach because he didn't let them do
[38:54] it
[38:55] until they came to that place
[38:59] and had power to cast out devils
[39:02] heal the sick do all kind of miracles
[39:04] and things right
[39:05] but yet didn't have the baptism and holy
[39:07] god
[39:08] and jesus told peter said peter after
[39:10] you're converted
[39:13] peter said what do you mean i'm
[39:14] converted i started following you i left
[39:16] my mama i left my mother-in-law i left
[39:18] my wife i left everything and come with
[39:20] you
[39:22] and i'll live with you three and a half
[39:24] years and listen to you over what you've
[39:25] taught and to believe all you say and
[39:28] you're telling me i'm not converted
[39:34] because that's what he told nicodemus
[39:36] you're not converted
[39:39] but listen
[39:41] then what happened
[39:45] what happened
[39:47] after that the holy ghost has come upon
[39:49] you
[39:51] you shall be witnesses then unto
[39:53] both in jerusalem and even to all of the
[39:56] earth
[39:58] after
[39:59] the holy ghost has come upon you you
[40:02] know the story upper room what was it
[40:04] doing well i think we got it it was
[40:06] reading one the other day and
[40:07] it really makes it look like you know
[40:09] maybe peter and you know brother ryan
[40:11] will just say words and and you put but
[40:13] one of the disciples said i think we
[40:15] need to take it by faith we've been up
[40:17] here nine days now
[40:20] somebody said yeah but we ain't got what
[40:22] he said
[40:23] which was power from on high and i
[40:25] always emphasize that right
[40:28] you go out there
[40:30] you go tell them about this new new
[40:32] message
[40:33] and they gonna kill you
[40:36] and he says i think we need to sit down
[40:37] and wait for something from coming on
[40:39] high because we ain't got it
[40:41] right
[40:43] that's what's wrong with the world today
[40:45] may i say what your prophet said
[40:47] without you thinking i'm making somebody
[40:49] lost or something
[40:51] he said there billy graham he said why
[40:53] didn't billy graham stand on that ground
[40:54] over there and call for god to come he
[40:57] said god would have honored him
[40:59] come on read your message
[41:01] he said god would have honored a man he
[41:03] said and still if not he said why didn't
[41:05] he say there's somebody in america we'll
[41:07] call for them to come
[41:11] because why because he didn't have the
[41:13] power
[41:15] he said you know but he remember okay
[41:20] all right
[41:22] so then you shall receive power after
[41:24] that the holy ghost has come upon you
[41:28] so what is the holy ghost
[41:31] power from on high
[41:35] to birth us into the kingdom of god
[41:39] bringing salvation to our souls
[41:42] not just to power from on high they
[41:44] already had power
[41:46] he doesn't give them power to cast out
[41:48] devils heal the sick
[41:52] right
[41:54] so it wasn't that kind of a power
[41:56] that come on the death pentecost
[42:03] what came on the day of pentecost
[42:10] brother branham says
[42:13] they can catch up with you too but i'm
[42:14] going to try to read a lot of these to
[42:16] save time
[42:18] brother branham says in the smyrna
[42:20] church age page 140 we'll read these
[42:22] again in a while they don't have to put
[42:23] it up
[42:25] now before we leave this subject i want
[42:26] to make myself clear on what the baptism
[42:29] with the holy ghost is according to the
[42:31] word
[42:34] it is not according to me
[42:36] and it's not according to you
[42:38] it has to be according to thus saith the
[42:42] lord
[42:44] or we are falsely
[42:47] led
[42:50] all right
[42:52] now i'm going to give you copies of
[42:53] these
[42:54] then i'm going to say what is the
[42:55] baptism of the holy ghost
[42:58] we're going to say brother branham said
[43:03] that
[43:05] what it is has got to be according to
[43:07] the word
[43:08] and what it is has got to be according
[43:10] to thus saith the lord
[43:13] so if somebody comes up to you outside
[43:15] or anywhere and they say what is the
[43:17] baptism of the holy spirit say it's got
[43:19] to be according to the word it's got to
[43:21] be according to thus saith the lord
[43:26] it'll stop all that we haven't even have
[43:27] yeah let's see it'll stop on it i think
[43:29] it's his don't you think his name i kind
[43:30] of believe it's here i don't know i
[43:31] believe it's out of it it'll stop all of
[43:33] them believe me babies
[43:36] it'll make it serious
[43:41] right
[43:43] come on we read this
[43:45] we went on to what is the
[43:47] what is is it that so many christians
[43:52] find it hard to live a christian life
[43:55] right around talking about the new wine
[43:57] busting them you know
[43:58] a new wine putting no bottle bust it
[44:01] all right but if you put the new wine
[44:03] into a new new bag that's what it was
[44:06] back there you know with your skin
[44:09] and the new skin has oil in it
[44:13] flexible
[44:15] and when the holy spirit comes down
[44:18] and says
[44:19] now when the holy spirit comes down and
[44:21] says
[44:24] now who's saying it
[44:25] the holy ghost
[44:27] well holy ghost knows who the holy ghost
[44:29] is
[44:30] the holy ghost knows what the holy ghost
[44:32] is
[44:33] right
[44:35] then when the holy spirit comes down and
[44:38] says
[44:38] the baptism of the holy spirit
[44:41] is the same today
[44:42] as it ever
[44:45] was
[44:48] well i think is i've got them
[44:50] don't worry about it it's in a message
[44:52] called blasphemous name
[44:53] he said holy ghost holy ghost holy ghost
[44:55] holy god
[44:56] come on there's one whole section in the
[44:58] church age book that's dedicated and
[45:00] we're going to read a whole lot of it to
[45:02] the statement that it's the holy ghost
[45:04] in every age
[45:05] it was never the holy ghost it was taken
[45:07] away
[45:10] luther had the holy ghost wesley had the
[45:12] holy ghost zeus had the holy ghost amen
[45:15] it was never taken away it was the word
[45:18] that went down
[45:20] the holy ghost then can only work
[45:22] according to the word so it could only
[45:24] work in luther's day according to the
[45:27] simplicity and the thoughts of
[45:29] justification but it was still the
[45:32] baptism of the holy spirit or he's not
[45:34] in the body of christ
[45:42] and when the holy spirit comes down and
[45:44] says
[45:46] the baptism of the holy spirit is the
[45:49] same today
[45:50] as it ever was
[45:53] all right
[45:54] what it was
[45:57] still is
[45:59] or hebrews 13 8 is missing it somewhere
[46:02] right
[46:04] now
[46:06] but that one we read up there was prayer
[46:08] or page 144 of this american church age
[46:12] listen to this go ahead and pull up
[46:14] number four we'll just start from there
[46:16] and i'll back up to one i didn't give
[46:18] you but
[46:20] brother brown i'm on page 154 the
[46:22] submarine church age
[46:24] what is the baptism
[46:26] with the holy ghost
[46:30] and he said up here we've got an
[46:32] it's got to be thus saith the lord
[46:34] so now what is thus saith the lord about
[46:36] the baptism of the holy spirit
[46:40] it is the spirit baptizing you into the
[46:43] body of christ
[46:47] it is the new birth
[46:53] don't forget that one see
[46:54] it is the spirit of god coming in and
[46:56] filling you
[46:58] after you have repented
[47:00] having heard his word and been baptized
[47:02] in the water an answer of a good
[47:04] conscience toward god
[47:07] what is
[47:08] the baptism
[47:11] of the holy ghost
[47:14] it's the spirit of god baptizing you
[47:16] into the body
[47:18] it's the new birth
[47:22] now where do we get to what the new
[47:23] birth is
[47:25] then you'll see why we gave those
[47:26] emphasis
[47:28] that you can
[47:30] without a sensation something
[47:33] what is the new birth
[47:40] brother branham goes on questions and
[47:42] answers on the seals
[47:44] and he said talking about the ages
[47:46] taking a dip into to the holy spirit
[47:49] now listen to it justification is a work
[47:52] of the holy spirit
[47:53] sanctification is the work of the holy
[47:54] spirit but the baptism is the holy
[47:56] spirit
[48:00] now what's he saying
[48:02] justification is a work of the holy
[48:03] spirit it's the holy spirit that comes
[48:05] in and causes you to repent you know the
[48:07] goodness of god is what the bible said
[48:09] leadeth thee to repentance is that
[48:10] scripture
[48:11] it's sanctification that carries you to
[48:13] where
[48:14] that you're repenting and trying to stay
[48:17] daily cleansed
[48:18] but that's still not the baptism
[48:22] you're not in the body of christ
[48:30] each one of those ages
[48:34] only taking a dip into the holy spirit
[48:37] because see luther and them couldn't
[48:38] come forth with the fullness as i said a
[48:40] moment ago they didn't know the word
[48:43] it was the word that was eat down
[48:46] it was not the holy ghost eat down
[48:50] how can you eat the holy ghost down
[48:55] it's the fact how much of the holy ghost
[48:57] could operate
[48:59] and he could only operate according to
[49:01] that situation
[49:04] right
[49:05] now
[49:08] then what did we cover trying to get
[49:09] over to a point what did we cover
[49:13] brother branham says
[49:15] now he's taught justification the same
[49:16] case in baptism and holy ghost right
[49:19] so in the future home paragraph 78 what
[49:22] did he say
[49:24] how he led us to himself
[49:27] to tabernacle in us by three stages of
[49:29] grace just like he's led the world in
[49:31] three stages and come to the world as
[49:33] god will come to the world after it's
[49:34] gone through these different stages of
[49:37] purification that's exactly how he comes
[49:39] to us through three stages of grace i
[49:42] taught that at the beginning
[49:48] now can you read
[49:51] i've never
[49:53] changed since
[49:55] since
[49:57] it's god's word
[49:59] so now here anything we get
[50:04] from now on now here's where brother
[50:06] daley is why i said you're going to
[50:08] think i'm stern i'm stern
[50:10] anything we get from here on after
[50:12] reading that
[50:15] and you say well i think it's this i'm
[50:17] going to tell you you have no right to
[50:19] think
[50:21] he said it if he's the prophet we
[50:23] believe him
[50:26] now he said
[50:30] that he'd always talk i taught that at
[50:32] the beginning
[50:35] i never changed since yeah but brother
[50:37] that i remember when he said you're born
[50:39] again baptized into the body that's
[50:41] exactly right
[50:48] it's just got to be put in the right
[50:49] place
[50:52] and the prophet's got to put it in the
[50:53] right places
[50:55] right
[50:58] come on
[51:00] look at the next one
[51:03] paragraph 86 the future home
[51:08] wait number seven
[51:12] notice how god makes it plain to us
[51:15] and if that wasn't a great confirmation
[51:17] a good
[51:18] a great loving blessing from god when i
[51:22] see this and see that since a boy
[51:26] first time ever christ dealt with me
[51:30] i've always taught those three stages
[51:34] of grace
[51:40] now
[51:43] what about it let's see if i can find
[51:44] one i don't think i gave it to him
[51:46] but
[51:49] let's see if i can find that one
[51:53] i never gave him this but listen to this
[51:55] off the paragraph 25 26 of the seed is
[51:59] not aired with a shook 1965 2 to
[52:02] 18. he's talking about your message will
[52:06] forerun the second coming
[52:08] john the baptist before run the first
[52:10] coming your message before run the
[52:12] second coming
[52:13] this is 30 years later and here i am
[52:16] tonight proclaiming that message
[52:20] and around the world has went
[52:23] and i'm glad to be back in my hometown
[52:26] tonight to represent this lord jesus
[52:29] christ that i still love
[52:32] with all my heart
[52:34] each day he grows still sweeter
[52:38] than he was the day before
[52:42] i've never changed
[52:45] one iota
[52:47] in my doctrine
[52:50] [Music]
[52:57] the first thing i started with i still
[53:01] believe the same thing tonight
[53:04] he's the same yesterday today and
[53:07] forever
[53:10] now i've got a message i'm responsible
[53:12] for
[53:14] he said never
[53:16] changed
[53:17] when i owed him amen
[53:19] now how many of you when that statement
[53:22] was made said well what about when he
[53:24] preached the white horse rider
[53:28] what about it
[53:31] what about when he preached the white
[53:32] horse rider as the holy ghost
[53:34] what about it
[53:38] was there anybody in the world that
[53:40] could straighten him out
[53:42] if it is i'd like to see their name hear
[53:44] their voice or whatever you want to do
[53:46] was there anybody
[53:48] a prophet stands before god in god alone
[53:54] and the prophet never knew the truth
[53:57] of the white horse writer
[53:58] so thereby he was not responsible
[54:02] he was responsible for preaching what
[54:04] the bible has taught and mankind had
[54:07] taught of the bible he had that correct
[54:11] the white horse rider under the seals
[54:14] had not been brought to no man so you
[54:16] can't judge brother branham with that
[54:19] it had never light had never shined
[54:21] there so get away from saying well i
[54:23] think well
[54:25] you say he never preached any error he
[54:27] never changed his doctrine he said but
[54:28] he did change doctrine show me where he
[54:30] changed
[54:32] well right there he shane you're out of
[54:34] the word
[54:35] because i didn't even know scripture
[54:37] brother brown was one that had to tell
[54:38] us what that white horse rider was
[54:42] cause the light had never shined on that
[54:44] you see what you're doing
[54:47] besides
[54:50] you know
[54:51] i think that's stern enough for myself
[54:53] but you know besides that
[54:55] you ever thought about
[55:01] you ever thought about what i've said
[55:03] while ago
[55:05] that the bible
[55:07] is the complete revelation of jesus
[55:10] christ
[55:12] the bible is not revealing no antichrist
[55:17] it reveals jesus christ and you see
[55:20] satan riding off
[55:23] okay
[55:26] so brother brown was right
[55:31] he never changed a doctrine because his
[55:33] doctrine has always been one god
[55:38] god not in three persons almighty god
[55:41] revealed
[55:43] as one true and living god
[55:45] what does seals reveal
[55:48] now if the seal's revealed get this
[55:50] point where you can hang this onto his
[55:52] message
[55:53] if the seals were revealing the
[55:55] antichrist then brother branham was
[55:57] wrong when he made that statement
[55:59] and he made that statement
[56:03] that i just read
[56:06] he made that statement
[56:09] off of the seed shall not be air with a
[56:11] shock or see not air with a shock in
[56:14] 1965 when he said i never changed one
[56:18] iota wouldn't it be something though
[56:20] somebody's saying
[56:23] brother brandon right around wait a
[56:24] minute wait a minute i got you
[56:26] he said what are you talking about
[56:27] brother
[56:29] you talked to a white horse rider was
[56:30] the holy ghost he was wrong he said
[56:32] you're exactly right
[56:38] well you change your doctor he said no i
[56:39] didn't
[56:41] he's because that never been revealed to
[56:43] nobody
[56:46] he said i never changed one iota of the
[56:48] written word of god
[56:53] you understand
[56:57] do you understand
[56:59] it's not what you and i think about it
[57:03] it's what god says about it
[57:07] you realize your prophet come on you've
[57:09] been in the message long enough
[57:11] he said the light had never shined on
[57:13] that
[57:16] but when light shined on no seals what
[57:19] did it reveal oh it revealed the
[57:21] antichrist boy you're really smart
[57:25] it had to be a futherment of the
[57:26] revelation of jesus christ because you
[57:29] couldn't have the bible as the written
[57:31] form or we're talking about up until 62
[57:34] or somewhere in there revealing jesus
[57:36] christ and then the seals revealing the
[57:39] white horse rider as the antichrist
[57:45] look what a mass confusion you're in
[57:48] you've got half the word revealing one
[57:50] god the other half revealing the devil
[57:54] and there's no such thing
[57:59] is that enough
[58:02] so we're going to hold a point what
[58:05] brother
[58:06] branham said
[58:09] that the baptism of the holy ghost
[58:12] was going to have to be made known
[58:15] you said
[58:17] they can run this if they want to number
[58:19] 2a is supposed to be in there but it
[58:21] doesn't matter because we read it
[58:22] wednesday on blasphemous names paragraph
[58:25] 90
[58:26] through 93.
[58:30] i believe that's the reason that there
[58:32] is so much confusion today about the
[58:35] holy spirit
[58:39] read this up here on the board
[58:42] it's not correctly talked
[58:53] believe that the baptism
[58:55] i believe that the baptism is taught
[58:58] but it's like you say automobile
[59:02] spark plugs this goes with he said and
[59:05] when you talk about the baptism of the
[59:08] holy spirit there's a lot
[59:11] that goes with that
[59:13] there's a lot goes with that
[59:17] and jesus is what he said saying is he's
[59:19] here
[59:20] to reveal it
[59:22] all right
[59:24] so what is it
[59:27] what is the baptism
[59:29] with the holy spirit
[59:33] and that he taught it correctly
[59:36] all of his life
[59:39] but yet we want all these things
[59:42] okay
[59:47] do you agree to these with us having to
[59:48] read all of the things
[59:51] that the spiritual birth requires three
[59:53] stages of grace before the person is
[59:56] truly born again they asked him that
[59:58] question he said absolutely
[1:00:03] the spiritual birth requires all three
[1:00:05] stages of grace
[1:00:08] before the person is truly born again
[1:00:12] all right
[1:00:14] it just explained that this morning
[1:00:18] you've got to have all three stages
[1:00:20] you're begotten of the spirit just like
[1:00:22] a baby's begotten into the wound of a
[1:00:24] mother but not born until you receive
[1:00:26] the holy ghost
[1:00:29] that's right
[1:00:30] you're born then
[1:00:32] you're not converted see you get what
[1:00:34] he's saying you're in the process of
[1:00:36] being converted until that time
[1:00:40] so what is the new birth it's three
[1:00:42] stages
[1:00:43] it's justification and
[1:00:45] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:00:48] holy spirit
[1:00:53] justification is a work of the holy
[1:00:54] spirit where does it work if i'm up
[1:00:57] there is it coming down
[1:01:00] and he can do what he wants to he can he
[1:01:02] can do it and he will
[1:01:05] or was justification something inside of
[1:01:07] you working to repent of your sins
[1:01:11] well that's where the
[1:01:13] holy ghost was working at
[1:01:18] what about sanctification what about the
[1:01:20] baptism
[1:01:22] already goes on to the message
[1:01:24] healing and what what cancer is
[1:01:28] he says when a man is born again of the
[1:01:30] spirit of god there was three elements
[1:01:31] came from the body of jesus
[1:01:34] that we go through to be borne again of
[1:01:36] the spirit of god water blood
[1:01:39] and spirit is that right
[1:01:42] pierce this side to come out it will
[1:01:43] come through justification
[1:01:45] sanctification baptism of the holy
[1:01:47] spirit into the body of christ the three
[1:01:50] now you see all the natural that's what
[1:01:53] constitutes the natural birth water
[1:01:55] blood life
[1:01:57] right
[1:01:58] that's what constitutes the new earth
[1:02:01] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:02:04] of the holy spirit
[1:02:06] all right
[1:02:07] he goes on into the message he swore by
[1:02:09] himself and said not three works of
[1:02:12] grace
[1:02:13] but one work in three different
[1:02:15] manifestations
[1:02:19] same holy spirit
[1:02:22] was with luther under justification
[1:02:26] was under wesley with sanctification
[1:02:31] in the church now in the baptism of the
[1:02:33] holy ghost the same holy spirit not two
[1:02:37] holy spirits
[1:02:39] the same holy spirit
[1:02:50] he explains on the medic dedication of
[1:02:52] the building we read that he talks about
[1:02:54] your body spirit and soul
[1:02:57] your three compartments
[1:02:59] you talk about god working the church is
[1:03:01] perfected through justification and
[1:03:03] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:03:05] holy ghost then you're sealed into the
[1:03:07] until the day of your redemption
[1:03:11] right
[1:03:14] what did we read the other day
[1:03:17] off the message israel in the church
[1:03:20] then the soul returned back in the form
[1:03:22] of the baptism
[1:03:25] the soul
[1:03:29] the soul of god amen
[1:03:32] because that's what he gave is a ransom
[1:03:33] right
[1:03:34] and the soul came back
[1:03:36] the anointing
[1:03:39] was the spirit of god right
[1:03:42] and you can have that every day and miss
[1:03:43] it that's right
[1:03:45] those old testament people had the
[1:03:47] anointing of the holy spirit but they
[1:03:49] didn't have the soul of god because it's
[1:03:50] never been opened up to bring out that's
[1:03:52] right
[1:03:54] all right
[1:03:56] returns back in the form of the baptism
[1:03:58] of the holy ghost
[1:04:01] and he goes on into the message of
[1:04:03] perfection
[1:04:04] but god himself came
[1:04:09] that his
[1:04:10] own spirit which is the highest line of
[1:04:12] the form came back what god himself came
[1:04:15] back
[1:04:16] that the
[1:04:17] his own spirit in the highest form
[1:04:21] look came back
[1:04:23] or come back
[1:04:25] can come back
[1:04:27] by the form of the baptism of the holy
[1:04:28] ghost
[1:04:30] holy spirit
[1:04:32] to the worshipper
[1:04:33] through the blood of jesus christ and
[1:04:35] take him into the body
[1:04:38] now your new birth is in your soul it is
[1:04:40] not your body it is not your spirit
[1:04:44] we'll go back through that some more but
[1:04:46] that should be enough that we can
[1:04:47] understand that
[1:04:54] i started right back over because
[1:04:56] what i was doing
[1:04:58] what is the baptism with the holy ghost
[1:05:02] it's the spirit baptizing you into the
[1:05:03] body of christ go ahead 154 or you can
[1:05:05] pick that talk and carry it on down
[1:05:09] it's spirit coming in and feeling you
[1:05:10] after you've repented having heard his
[1:05:12] word and been baptized in water as an
[1:05:14] answer of a good conscience
[1:05:16] now he explains
[1:05:21] explains it so this is not brother dale
[1:05:23] explaining it
[1:05:26] it's we're reading it
[1:05:30] what we have just set forth would be
[1:05:32] much easier for all to understand
[1:05:34] if all believe the doctrine of the
[1:05:36] oneness of the godhead
[1:05:38] for there are not three persons in the
[1:05:41] godhead but one
[1:05:43] thus we are not born again
[1:05:46] by the spirit of life of jesus christ
[1:05:48] coming in and then subsequent which
[1:05:51] means afterward
[1:05:53] to that the holy spirit coming in to
[1:05:56] give us power
[1:05:57] he said that's not true
[1:06:00] if that were true
[1:06:04] see if you're born again by one and then
[1:06:06] this other happens if that were true see
[1:06:08] there's only two being dealt with up
[1:06:10] here
[1:06:11] that's been see you saved with us we're
[1:06:13] born again by the spirit of jesus christ
[1:06:14] coming in and then after that the holy
[1:06:16] spirit comes he left the father out
[1:06:19] so now read it if that were true
[1:06:22] why
[1:06:23] are we dishonoring the father but not
[1:06:25] giving him a part in our complete
[1:06:27] salvation
[1:06:28] for our salvation is of the lord and
[1:06:31] there are three lords
[1:06:34] then he father must have something to do
[1:06:37] too
[1:06:38] but surely it can be seen that jesus
[1:06:42] made this very clear
[1:06:44] that it was he and he alone
[1:06:46] who is god and is he and he alone who is
[1:06:50] coming into the believer
[1:06:52] then he goes to john about the comforter
[1:06:55] they send a comforter he says it covers
[1:06:57] the comforter it's jesus covers on down
[1:06:59] now listen
[1:07:00] so he says now in verse 23 and speaking
[1:07:03] to the disciples he said
[1:07:05] we father and son
[1:07:08] now
[1:07:09] will come unto him thus it's the father
[1:07:11] son and the holy ghost all coming in at
[1:07:17] the one time
[1:07:20] for it is one person comprising the
[1:07:23] godhead
[1:07:27] then read that and listen think about it
[1:07:30] this is the father son and holy ghost
[1:07:32] all coming in at the one time
[1:07:36] but it's not one person compre i mean
[1:07:39] for it is one person comprising the body
[1:07:41] so there's just one god and he said that
[1:07:43] took place at pentecost
[1:07:50] now
[1:07:54] it can't be one person justifying you
[1:07:56] one sanctifying you and one feeling you
[1:08:04] now that can't be
[1:08:07] you say but he's saying there that it's
[1:08:09] one one person comprising the godhead
[1:08:12] that's right
[1:08:14] he's talking about the baptism he ain't
[1:08:16] talking about justification
[1:08:20] sanctification and then the baptism he's
[1:08:23] talking about the baptism
[1:08:25] read it
[1:08:28] justification is not the baptism of the
[1:08:30] holy ghost sanctification is not the
[1:08:32] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:08:34] neither one of them is the person of
[1:08:36] jesus christ living in you
[1:08:38] it's the one person coming in you
[1:08:41] comprising the godhead so when you
[1:08:42] receive the new birth i remember when i
[1:08:44] made that statement about 30 years ago
[1:08:46] and everybody
[1:08:49] i said the new birth is
[1:08:51] father son and holy ghost coming and
[1:08:52] dwelling in you at one time
[1:08:54] and man everybody's
[1:08:58] it took me months to explain that
[1:09:01] enough to where people would settle down
[1:09:03] and listen
[1:09:08] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:11] is the person of jesus christ
[1:09:15] justification not the person it's the
[1:09:17] work of that person upon you
[1:09:19] sanctification is not the person it's
[1:09:21] the work of that person upon you
[1:09:25] but the baptism is the holy spirit
[1:09:27] that's the one god coming in at one time
[1:09:29] that's what happened to us trying to
[1:09:31] explain to you
[1:09:32] wednesday amen
[1:09:34] that's what happened back there
[1:09:37] it took the disciples three and one half
[1:09:39] years
[1:09:41] to get justified and sanctified
[1:09:49] right
[1:09:54] but they still wouldn't convert it
[1:09:56] they still didn't have the baptism in
[1:09:58] the holy spirit they still had to go to
[1:10:00] the upper room and wait on the baptism
[1:10:04] what about three and a half years going
[1:10:06] through justification
[1:10:07] baptism and holy god
[1:10:10] church i know and i know what was tried
[1:10:12] to be taught right here and i agree with
[1:10:14] it to a degree but i told the brother i
[1:10:17] didn't agree with him to the degree
[1:10:21] you ever heard it taught a lot of people
[1:10:23] you don't have to wait on the holy ghost
[1:10:24] you just get it
[1:10:30] well it's totally going waiting up a
[1:10:31] room
[1:10:33] but the point was good it was right some
[1:10:35] people believe all the way right at one
[1:10:38] one time at the altar they can believe
[1:10:40] all the way through justification and
[1:10:42] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[1:10:44] ghost right there in one thing but then
[1:10:46] i'll quote the rest of this message here
[1:10:48] brother brown said very few will
[1:10:51] all right
[1:10:52] so we got an occasion that we got to
[1:10:54] cover that it can happen because it
[1:10:56] happened three and a half years and the
[1:10:58] disciples got finally the baptism
[1:11:01] outside three thousand got the holy
[1:11:03] ghost in a 30-minute sermon
[1:11:08] they went through justification
[1:11:10] sanctification and baptism and holy
[1:11:11] ghost
[1:11:13] in a 30-minute sermon
[1:11:15] a few days maybe to the house of
[1:11:16] cornelius so the visions and the doings
[1:11:19] and the traveling
[1:11:20] but they received the baptism of the
[1:11:22] holy ghost and said the same as we did
[1:11:23] at the beginning
[1:11:27] why
[1:11:29] because it was brand new
[1:11:31] and god was there to engulf anybody that
[1:11:34] would believe him
[1:11:38] but you said well what happened the
[1:11:40] devil got in and he started telling the
[1:11:42] people you need to do this you need to
[1:11:44] do that what was brother branham's
[1:11:46] statement one time he said
[1:11:48] where it says you know repent everyone
[1:11:50] will be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:11:51] christ he said we tell them what to do
[1:11:53] and what not to do
[1:11:55] right
[1:11:58] well come on up to the altar and get
[1:12:00] your baptism right
[1:12:02] and then repent everybody's in the
[1:12:03] building and get all that done and then
[1:12:05] we're going to pray for you to get the
[1:12:06] holy ghost
[1:12:11] ain't no bible
[1:12:13] they went in the bible
[1:12:16] in bible times you know what i'm talking
[1:12:18] about bible times writing of the bible
[1:12:20] of the apostles none of them went that
[1:12:23] away
[1:12:24] the closest you can get
[1:12:26] is apollos
[1:12:28] but remember apollos knew nothing about
[1:12:30] jesus christ being crucified read your
[1:12:33] bible
[1:12:36] that we know nothing about this
[1:12:39] did we only know from john that jesus
[1:12:42] was the christ
[1:12:46] but the holy ghost came
[1:12:50] but why can't why you can't get the holy
[1:12:51] ghost on people today
[1:12:53] because you're sitting there wondering
[1:12:54] what's going to happen you're wondering
[1:12:56] what's brother dale doing you're
[1:12:58] wondering how that we can do this how
[1:12:59] you're wondering what's down there for
[1:13:01] to eat you're wondering what's going on
[1:13:04] you're trying to do this you're trying
[1:13:05] to figure out this i wonder is mama all
[1:13:07] right i wonder daddy all right i
[1:13:08] wondered everything running all right
[1:13:10] you know what i'm talking about
[1:13:12] it's a devil
[1:13:14] coming into you
[1:13:17] and getting you to sit there and
[1:13:18] entertain thoughts that the holy ghost
[1:13:21] can't come through
[1:13:22] because the holy ghost can't come
[1:13:23] through
[1:13:26] and override
[1:13:27] your free moral
[1:13:30] agency is that right
[1:13:34] he can't override you for immoral agency
[1:13:37] he can't make you take something
[1:13:40] you have to invite him in
[1:13:42] no but brother dale i got all this see
[1:13:44] that's what i'm saying there he goes to
[1:13:46] running yeah but i got word
[1:13:48] he chose me i didn't choose him that's
[1:13:50] right but if you don't accept him he
[1:13:51] can't save you
[1:13:53] now get your thoughts
[1:13:57] he just saved me and then i accepted him
[1:13:59] one day well yeah he did for the sound
[1:14:01] ladies in the world it's gonna go that
[1:14:03] way
[1:14:05] but you see church i try i cry and i try
[1:14:08] and i pray god give me some way he gives
[1:14:11] me thoughts and i come to you but does
[1:14:13] it dwell within you
[1:14:17] brother branham draw out those things he
[1:14:19] drawn out the church
[1:14:20] he drawn out that first church
[1:14:22] all white except a little dark either
[1:14:24] bottom or top of one place he left a
[1:14:26] little dark he said that was the
[1:14:28] antichrist or the devil
[1:14:29] the next church age
[1:14:31] it went down
[1:14:33] the next church age it went down or the
[1:14:34] amount of white until the fourth church
[1:14:36] age you had a whole black circle with a
[1:14:40] little bit of light
[1:14:45] see that's what's wrong now
[1:14:48] you can't say it and listen
[1:14:50] without the brain running
[1:14:53] i know that
[1:14:54] and then no way have i ever said okay
[1:14:56] now what we need to do is we need to
[1:14:57] just blot out and go blank
[1:14:59] because brother said you don't do that
[1:15:00] he said the devil will come in okay
[1:15:03] well wouldn't that be a good thing if we
[1:15:05] could blank us all out
[1:15:06] now the devil come in
[1:15:08] so what good have we done
[1:15:11] well the devil don't do to me he didn't
[1:15:12] talk to me
[1:15:19] i always try to be honest
[1:15:21] i was listening earlier the other day
[1:15:22] and i heard myself on that two times
[1:15:24] saying it
[1:15:25] i said the devil talking to me about 99
[1:15:27] of the time
[1:15:32] well you need to get straightened out i
[1:15:33] agree with you
[1:15:35] i'm trying
[1:15:36] but i'm telling you you're right there
[1:15:38] with me
[1:15:39] maybe 96 and a half
[1:15:42] instead of 97 percent
[1:15:48] don't tell me what you're sitting there
[1:15:49] thinking
[1:15:50] i'll quote a brother he said
[1:15:53] he was listening to me preached one time
[1:15:54] and he told me later he said i figured
[1:15:56] out how to fix that tractor and you
[1:15:57] preaching
[1:15:58] you really enjoyed that didn't you
[1:16:03] yeah i mean he's honest he just said it
[1:16:06] you know
[1:16:08] but what about it
[1:16:12] do you see what i'm talking about
[1:16:14] it's got to work now that it takes time
[1:16:18] listen it takes time to go through
[1:16:20] justification sanctification and the
[1:16:23] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:16:28] i spent
[1:16:31] from
[1:16:32] 58
[1:16:35] to uh
[1:16:36] we'll just make it 66
[1:16:39] give or take a little 67.
[1:16:41] i spent that in the baptist church
[1:16:45] i'd become work so much and talked so
[1:16:47] much until when i left the church i was
[1:16:49] teaching the adult sunday school classes
[1:16:53] which was the deacons and elders and
[1:16:55] their wives
[1:16:57] so you can see what they honored
[1:17:00] i was a sunday school teacher i was a
[1:17:02] sunday school superintendent at the same
[1:17:04] time i had to get all the records
[1:17:06] together and still teach the lesson
[1:17:08] i was a training union director i had to
[1:17:11] run all of those things i was i don't
[1:17:13] can't remember so many more but i was a
[1:17:15] deacon
[1:17:18] you know they thought a lot of me
[1:17:20] they never run me out
[1:17:24] you can say they run me out of shirts
[1:17:25] when i took kids they never run me out
[1:17:29] my brother walked out and he said what
[1:17:30] do you want a church i'll build we'll
[1:17:31] build you a church
[1:17:33] my mom said where you going i said i
[1:17:35] don't know
[1:17:36] i said i know where i'm going to church
[1:17:38] for a while but i don't know what i'm
[1:17:39] going to do
[1:17:42] but you see something had happened to me
[1:17:44] but i was just in justification and
[1:17:46] sanctification
[1:17:48] i came in this message and for two years
[1:17:52] i sought the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:17:54] you've heard my testimony
[1:17:56] don't get dull with it it happened
[1:18:00] two years in this message i would never
[1:18:02] claim the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:18:04] whatever basically one of you right now
[1:18:06] sitting here says that you've got the
[1:18:07] holy ghost because you believe the
[1:18:08] message of the hour
[1:18:11] or in some form you know i've done this
[1:18:13] it brought me to here and it brought me
[1:18:15] to there
[1:18:16] instead of going back and sitting down
[1:18:17] and thinking what happened to you
[1:18:22] we get over into new birth i'll take my
[1:18:24] whole experience and put it in the bible
[1:18:30] but you see
[1:18:31] it finally had to come to a time
[1:18:34] that it was settled
[1:18:37] in the soul of an individual
[1:18:39] okay
[1:18:40] listen
[1:18:44] so what is it
[1:18:48] you're not born again by the spirit of
[1:18:50] jesus christ coming in
[1:18:52] and then later are subsequent
[1:18:54] to that the holy school holy spirit
[1:18:57] coming in to give us power
[1:18:59] and we're going to read brother brown
[1:19:00] and said that's exactly what happened
[1:19:06] but you're going to have to find out
[1:19:07] what he's talking about
[1:19:13] well who are you to say who are you
[1:19:14] talking about
[1:19:15] i'm me who are you
[1:19:18] no problem we get that settled
[1:19:22] but listen
[1:19:24] he said thus it's the father son and
[1:19:26] holy ghost
[1:19:29] coming into you at one time
[1:19:33] it's not the father justification the
[1:19:36] son of sanctification and the holy ghost
[1:19:40] it's justification a work of the holy
[1:19:42] spirit it's sanctification the work of
[1:19:44] the holy spirit it's the baptism of the
[1:19:46] holy spirit which is the person of jesus
[1:19:48] christ coming and living in you which is
[1:19:51] the father son and the holy ghost all
[1:19:53] because it's not tree
[1:19:57] it's one
[1:20:01] it's one god
[1:20:03] all right
[1:20:05] okay
[1:20:14] i like it this one i just put it in as a
[1:20:15] next one because it's continual reading
[1:20:18] once you start reading at 144 you're
[1:20:20] going to find what i'm reading here is a
[1:20:22] continual reading out of the church age
[1:20:23] book we will continue that in a minute
[1:20:25] but look what he says on
[1:20:27] on
[1:20:29] 144
[1:20:31] which starts with number one
[1:20:34] then the number two will be
[1:20:36] going on so you want to listen so
[1:20:40] so you can see now that we cannot afford
[1:20:42] to say what the bible has not said
[1:20:46] when scripture teaches us that the work
[1:20:48] of the holy spirit and the manifestation
[1:20:51] of that holiest
[1:20:54] of that blessed person
[1:20:56] is to bring the truth of each age
[1:20:59] to the true seed
[1:21:01] of that age
[1:21:04] then we know that the spirit has to be
[1:21:07] abiding in the person or he cannot
[1:21:10] receive the truth for that time
[1:21:14] that is exactly correct
[1:21:18] okay
[1:21:21] then he starts back over with a
[1:21:22] statement i'd unread two or three times
[1:21:26] go ahead and continue just pull it up
[1:21:27] we'll read fast as we can and quit
[1:21:30] before we leave the subject this is a
[1:21:32] continuation of reading now
[1:21:34] i want to make myself very clear on what
[1:21:36] the baptism of the holy spirit is
[1:21:38] according to the word it's not according
[1:21:40] to me and it's not according to you
[1:21:42] it has to be according to thus saith the
[1:21:44] lord or we are falsely taught
[1:21:47] i read these to you wednesday you say
[1:21:48] well you just keep reading it i'll
[1:21:50] probably read it again this coming
[1:21:51] wednesday
[1:21:53] okay if you won't stay at home
[1:21:54] okay you turn on the internet you're
[1:21:56] going to hear it
[1:21:58] look to begin with
[1:22:00] you will notice that in my meetings now
[1:22:02] watch him explain something
[1:22:05] he explains if the denominational mix-up
[1:22:10] of the churches
[1:22:12] and what they think
[1:22:14] and what they do shows what they think
[1:22:20] to begin with you will notice that in my
[1:22:22] meetings when i have
[1:22:23] finished preaching an evangelistic
[1:22:26] service
[1:22:27] or some teaching message
[1:22:29] i cast a net and an invited response
[1:22:32] from the people
[1:22:33] i ask them to come forward and receive
[1:22:36] the holy spirit
[1:22:39] now listen
[1:22:42] he's asking to come forth and receive
[1:22:44] the holy spirit now watch what they do
[1:22:48] my pentecostal friends upon hearing
[1:22:51] me
[1:22:52] say
[1:22:54] this
[1:22:55] believe that i say this believe that i
[1:22:58] am inviting people to come forward to be
[1:23:00] baptized with the holy ghost because
[1:23:02] they're already born again
[1:23:06] see they think they're born again by the
[1:23:10] receiving our believing
[1:23:12] right
[1:23:13] something caused them to start their
[1:23:15] journey
[1:23:16] so they believe that was the born-again
[1:23:18] experience and then when he's asking
[1:23:20] them to come and pray for the baptism of
[1:23:22] the holy spirit look what they say
[1:23:24] he said
[1:23:25] be baptized with the holy ghost because
[1:23:27] they're already born again so when i
[1:23:28] invite those who are spirit-filled to
[1:23:31] come and have wonderful how sweet and
[1:23:34] that guy can talk
[1:23:35] i can't talk that away and i'm sorry
[1:23:38] but i don't have to worry about it
[1:23:39] either
[1:23:40] i can't he look what he talked invite
[1:23:42] those who are spirit-filled he never
[1:23:44] throwed off on people
[1:23:46] in other words said to be in me you know
[1:23:48] what i said i said if you and so when
[1:23:52] when i invite those who are
[1:23:54] not even born again yet
[1:23:57] to come up and help pray
[1:23:59] that's what i'd say
[1:24:01] but he's nice
[1:24:04] he called someone you ever noticed him
[1:24:05] he said yes they're christians
[1:24:08] he said oh robert's billy graham he said
[1:24:10] hey allen he said he's a man of god
[1:24:12] he's a great christian
[1:24:16] i wish i could do that
[1:24:21] so when i invite those who are
[1:24:22] spirit-filled to come and deal with
[1:24:24] those who have answered the invitation
[1:24:26] to receive the
[1:24:28] spirit now he didn't say to get
[1:24:31] justified sanctified and filled with the
[1:24:33] holy ghost he's teaching what to get
[1:24:36] them to get the spirit the holy spirit
[1:24:39] the new birth
[1:24:42] read it
[1:24:44] those who answered the invitation to
[1:24:46] receive the spirit those dear ones
[1:24:48] search forward and deal with the people
[1:24:50] in such manner as to encourage them to
[1:24:52] yield to god and believe to speak in
[1:24:54] tongues
[1:24:57] this has caused a great deal of
[1:24:59] confusion
[1:25:02] and i want to tell you exactly what i
[1:25:04] mean
[1:25:07] now when he gives an altar call what
[1:25:09] does he mean
[1:25:18] he gives an altar call if i was giving
[1:25:20] an all the call today i wouldn't say now
[1:25:22] now what i want you to do some of you
[1:25:23] come i want you to come up and i want
[1:25:24] you to repent i want you to be baptized
[1:25:27] and i want you to do this and i want you
[1:25:28] to do that i want you to be justified i
[1:25:30] want you to be sanctified i want you to
[1:25:31] do this no i ask you to come up and be
[1:25:33] filled with the holy spirit
[1:25:35] because you know what if you are it'll
[1:25:38] take care of all them other things
[1:25:41] right
[1:25:43] it'll take care of the life
[1:25:46] the prophet he said i want to tell you
[1:25:47] exactly what i mean
[1:25:49] i mean for the sinner to come forward
[1:25:52] and be born again now listen to it he
[1:25:54] said up here to receive the spirit watch
[1:25:56] him
[1:25:58] forward and be born again which is to be
[1:26:01] baptized into the body of christ
[1:26:04] by the holy ghost which is what took
[1:26:08] which is exactly what took place at
[1:26:10] pentecost when the church was launched
[1:26:13] amen
[1:26:16] he's wanting a pentecostal
[1:26:18] experience to come to people and they're
[1:26:20] trying to get them to speak in tongues
[1:26:22] and shout and all these other things
[1:26:24] because they've been taught that
[1:26:27] i stood in jamaica
[1:26:30] and in a way i rejoiced in the way i
[1:26:32] cried
[1:26:33] because how was i going to take on 300
[1:26:35] people
[1:26:36] wade and we got there about that time
[1:26:38] but that would have mean about three of
[1:26:39] us against 300 people
[1:26:42] how was we going to handle that
[1:26:44] when those people down there was taking
[1:26:46] them little children
[1:26:48] i've never seen that you've been there i
[1:26:50] didn't they were taking them children
[1:26:51] and saying say it say it say it say it
[1:26:53] say it say it
[1:26:55] trying their best to get them little
[1:26:56] children because i had invited the
[1:26:58] children to come to the altar to be
[1:27:00] saved what did i mean to come and
[1:27:02] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:27:06] the new birth
[1:27:07] but they would speak speak speak say it
[1:27:09] say it say it say it
[1:27:12] i wanted i'm sorry
[1:27:16] i wanted to go down there
[1:27:18] and take him and go
[1:27:23] you say yeah i mean
[1:27:25] i wanted to throw him out the door
[1:27:28] because he was falsifying
[1:27:30] the new birth to them kids
[1:27:32] that i had gotten to the altar
[1:27:35] for salvation
[1:27:39] what if they'd look back and said
[1:27:40] brother dale
[1:27:41] you've got them in the altar
[1:27:44] now come and lead them to christ
[1:27:52] they wouldn't do that at all
[1:27:55] no way
[1:28:00] okay
[1:28:02] in other words to be born of the spirit
[1:28:05] is to be truly baptized with the holy
[1:28:07] ghost
[1:28:08] it is one and the sign
[1:28:14] to be born again and baptized into the
[1:28:16] body
[1:28:18] and to have the new birth is all one of
[1:28:20] the same
[1:28:26] he goes
[1:28:28] let's get this one
[1:28:30] he said
[1:28:32] i realize it's going to be confusing for
[1:28:34] a moment
[1:28:35] because most people know that i was
[1:28:37] ordained a baptist preacher you see they
[1:28:39] think he was saying just believe
[1:28:41] come on just believe that what was he
[1:28:44] saying about him everybody knows he'd
[1:28:45] ordained the baptist preacher they was
[1:28:47] thinking well you know he was saying
[1:28:49] they're going to think i'm just a
[1:28:50] baptist and we baptist just get out when
[1:28:52] we believe
[1:28:54] so what'd he say i have steadfastly
[1:28:56] declared that the baptist have missed it
[1:28:59] for saying you receive the holy ghost
[1:29:01] when you believe
[1:29:02] for that is not so you received him
[1:29:06] since
[1:29:07] you believed amen
[1:29:12] too late to try to continue let's stand
[1:29:14] come on brothers
[1:29:15] while they're coming think about what
[1:29:17] i'm saying because this is two services
[1:29:19] on the same thing
[1:29:20] and if i don't care to preach three more
[1:29:25] and i just tell you if you want to lay
[1:29:26] out go ahead do what you want to because
[1:29:28] it ain't going to change me
[1:29:32] i set myself aside years ago for one
[1:29:34] thing to preach the gospel
[1:29:38] i'm open for discussion of anything i
[1:29:40] preach or anything that i'm doing
[1:29:44] but now you tell them and tell me
[1:29:46] that the holy ghost is going to lead
[1:29:48] away from this i'm going to tell you
[1:29:51] holy ghost don't do that
[1:29:54] there is only one new birth
[1:29:57] it's been the same in every church age
[1:30:01] it was the same as the day of pentecost
[1:30:03] they went through justification
[1:30:05] sanctification and the holy ghost fell
[1:30:08] the three thousand outside went through
[1:30:10] justification sanctification
[1:30:13] and the baptism right there at once
[1:30:16] you say how could that be that's what i
[1:30:17] tried to explain when a moment ago on a
[1:30:19] rare occasion a person could come to the
[1:30:21] altar especially a sinner
[1:30:24] you ever noticed brother branham
[1:30:26] he said one
[1:30:28] altar call
[1:30:29] in africa and 35 thousand or 25 thousand
[1:30:34] born-again christians
[1:30:42] it's possible that a human being
[1:30:45] because of not being taught and drug
[1:30:47] about by all the doctrines could come to
[1:30:50] an altar
[1:30:51] and right there god could go through as
[1:30:53] a cleansing of a repentance
[1:30:55] and give the person the new birth
[1:30:58] but it's
[1:30:59] very rare
[1:31:01] so then it's going to be
[1:31:04] as i saying about the brother that tried
[1:31:06] to preach it here he's saying there
[1:31:08] ain't no such thing and the bible is
[1:31:09] tearing for the holy ghost i said they
[1:31:11] did an upper room i said no you can
[1:31:14] i know what he was trying to say he was
[1:31:15] trying to say what i was trying to say
[1:31:17] we ought to believe all the way through
[1:31:19] it one time
[1:31:20] but very few people's going to do it
[1:31:23] i ain't going to ask no raise of hands
[1:31:25] but how many of you believed through at
[1:31:26] one time
[1:31:28] i've been honest enough to tell you i
[1:31:30] was two years in this message
[1:31:37] like one brother told me he said i know
[1:31:38] my my i know they got the holy ghost
[1:31:41] because you don't cut the hair
[1:31:44] and wear long dresses
[1:31:46] well okay
[1:31:49] i didn't want to be aggravating and
[1:31:51] arrogant you think i am but you know
[1:31:52] what the girls in my day
[1:31:55] wear long dresses and didn't cut their
[1:31:56] hair
[1:31:57] the worldly girls because they knew what
[1:32:00] a woman looked like
[1:32:06] come on you say brother dale you're no
[1:32:08] no i'm not i'm telling the god's on his
[1:32:10] truth
[1:32:14] they knew what a woman looked like
[1:32:19] it seemed like maybe the world don't
[1:32:20] know it now we'll go ahead what we got
[1:32:22] let's see
[1:32:23] it's one verse or something and if
[1:32:25] anybody has a need come on and we'll
[1:32:26] believe remember wait this afternoon
[1:32:28] [Music]

[1:32:32] us the word
[1:32:36] [Music]
[1:32:52] father
[1:32:53] we send this prayer claw to
[1:32:55] our brother's wife and just ask you to
[1:32:57] take care of all the problems
[1:32:59] let everything be all right we believe
[1:33:01] it and we thank you in jesus name
[1:33:04] anybody else
[1:33:09] do you know you have the baptism of the
[1:33:11] holy spirit
[1:33:14] you know
[1:33:16] well i've never done things that other
[1:33:18] people say they done when they got it
[1:33:20] forget that
[1:33:23] that's a copycat trying to be what
[1:33:24] somebody else is
[1:33:26] but it's your own experience
[1:33:28] and let god deal with you in your own
[1:33:30] life
[1:33:30] [Music]
[1:33:32] it ain't what mama done daddy done
[1:33:35] brother sister
[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:39] he says what are you gonna do
[1:33:43] i met this
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:34:03] needs his prayer claws to take it
[1:34:05] we believe it'll take care of whatever
[1:34:07] he's asking but he said he needed to
[1:34:08] touch from you
[1:34:10] so father
[1:34:12] just drop down beyond all mental
[1:34:14] capacities of the human mind
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:23] in jesus
[1:34:36] for something
[1:34:38] happened
[1:34:40] and now
[1:34:42] i know
[1:34:46] i want to ask you
[1:34:48] one simple question
[1:34:51] [Music]
[1:34:53] now is this true
[1:34:56] that sozo sorry how you pronounce that
[1:34:58] word means to be delivered
[1:35:02] right
[1:35:03] and brother brown said it's the same
[1:35:05] [Music]
[1:35:06] for the human healings and the time he
[1:35:09] said it's a sign for the soul
[1:35:11] is that true
[1:35:16] well now
[1:35:17] how many of you have ever been healed
[1:35:20] i mean literally know the time or
[1:35:22] there's something in your life that
[1:35:23] you've healed
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:26] did it come with shouting
[1:35:28] [Music]
[1:35:32] then why would you want to put the
[1:35:35] holy ghost coming and shouting or crying
[1:35:37] or speaking in tongues or some
[1:35:38] manifestation when you don't want to put
[1:35:41] the
[1:35:42] healing
[1:35:45] [Music]
[1:35:46] listen to the point
[1:35:49] when you're healed it's
[1:35:51] something just comes down and sure you
[1:35:52] can have feelings you can have all that
[1:35:55] but you know what i'm talking about
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:35:58] it's just a knowledge that comes to you
[1:36:00] [Music]
[1:36:07] it's the knowledge
[1:36:12] sometimes he says
[1:36:14] we were up in

[1:36:17] [Music]
[1:36:19] wade was having a lot of trouble with
[1:36:20] his back we were going to be there about
[1:36:22] three or four days hunting and brother
[1:36:24] dean we were there together and he said
[1:36:26] we were talking he said we need to lay
[1:36:28] hands on and pray for him i said yeah
[1:36:30] let's do it
[1:36:31] i didn't go lay hands on and pray for
[1:36:33] him
[1:36:34] because when i seen him touch wade
[1:36:37] i knew
[1:36:40] that he was healed
[1:36:43] i got the knowledge
[1:36:45] they went through the act

[1:36:51] days that new birth
[1:36:54] is a knowledge
[1:36:56] to you

[1:37:07] baby screaming and hollering
