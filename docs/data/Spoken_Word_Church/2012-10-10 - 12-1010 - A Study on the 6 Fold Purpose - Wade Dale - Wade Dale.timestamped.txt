[9:24] we want to be we want to be focused
[9:28] the heavenly father we pray tonight Lord
[9:30] that you would come Among Us in a
[9:32] special way
[9:34] Lord we know that your Prophet told us
[9:36] that
[9:37] these things are important and they must
[9:40] be understood and even in the in the
[9:43] book lord sister media was concerned
[9:47] that the group of people that he was
[9:50] preaching to were simple and may not
[9:52] understand this and the prophets that
[9:55] God will make away
[9:57] if God wrote it and the prophet spoke it
[9:59] I believe Lord that you're here to make
[10:02] it manifest you're here to reveal it to
[10:05] babe such it would learn
[10:07] we pray now Lord that you would just be
[10:09] with us Lord take care of us be with a
[10:12] special request that we've heard Lord be
[10:14] with Mom and Dad bless them Lord as
[10:16] they're taking vacation and Richard and
[10:18] Abby and sister Lisa Lord we pray now
[10:20] that you just bless them give them rest
[10:22] and let them come back lord
[10:25] rejuvenated and ready to go
[10:27] father we pray that you'd be with us
[10:29] tonight
[10:30] be with us along the way father you do
[10:32] the speaking tonight let each one Lord
[10:35] the hearers hear
[10:36] and Lord let us understand what you've
[10:39] given us you've given it to us clear
[10:41] you've given us understanding and Lord
[10:45] now we want to break it down to the
[10:46] people
[10:47] so that they can understand Lord
[10:49] and get more out of you father more of
[10:52] you that's what we want Lord
[10:54] be with us lead us and guide us by your
[10:56] Holy Spirit may your word not return
[10:58] void will accomplish what is said in
[11:00] Jesus name we pray amen Daniel 9 24
[11:06] and I'm going to read it I I told
[11:08] brother Mark and then we got this out of
[11:10] a car that that we um that we took back
[11:13] in and it is a Tyndale Bible I don't
[11:16] know if anybody's ever read but William
[11:18] Kendale was one of the first writers of
[11:21] the Bible in English actually the
[11:23] Catholic Church put him to death yes for
[11:26] writing the Bible in such a simple form
[11:29] so that people could understand it they
[11:32] strangled them and burned him at the
[11:34] stake because of what he wrote this
[11:36] Bible and made it simple for the people
[11:38] but William Tyndale was uh he was during
[11:42] the Martin Luther era back in the 1500s
[11:45] and if you want to look him up you can
[11:46] go Google William Tyndale
[11:48] t-y-n-d-a-l-e and he wrote this Bible
[11:52] out of the Latin Vulgate but he brought
[11:55] it down so that that's why the Catholic
[11:57] Church wanted to kill him because they
[11:59] wanted it to be taken away from the
[12:01] people that they couldn't understand it
[12:02] that the Catholic Church could tell them
[12:04] what the Bible says but when William
[12:06] Tyndale come in and give it to the
[12:07] common people they got mad at him and
[12:10] killed him all right so I'm going to
[12:12] read out of this and you read it off of
[12:14] your off of your screen because I really
[12:17] like this and let me let me let you
[12:18] understand something here remember now
[12:20] this is I'm reading this out of his
[12:22] Bible in the 1500s all right the Lord
[12:25] has commanded 490 years of further
[12:28] punishment upon Jerusalem and your
[12:30] people
[12:32] so brother Brandon's not the only one
[12:33] that knew 70 weeks
[12:36] that there was one week equals seven
[12:37] years he says 490 years in this Bible
[12:42] okay
[12:43] brother Brown said it was all in
[12:45] Scripture he just had to bring it out
[12:48] and bring it to light it was already
[12:49] there he's brought it to light so that
[12:52] we could see it because we always read
[12:54] it and others read it 70 weeks are
[12:56] determined but here brother Tyndale the
[12:59] Lord has commanded 490 years
[13:02] of further punishment upon Jerusalem and
[13:05] your people
[13:06] then at last they will learn to stay
[13:09] away from sin
[13:11] pretty good idea
[13:13] and their guilt will be cleansed
[13:16] then the kingdom of everlasting
[13:18] righteousness will begin and the most
[13:19] holy place in the temple will be
[13:22] rededicated not reanointed but it'd be
[13:24] rededicated as the prophets have
[13:27] declared
[13:28] now listen it will be 49 years plus 434
[13:32] years
[13:34] boy did he have a revelation
[13:38] from the time the command is given to
[13:41] rebuild Jerusalem until the anointed one
[13:43] comes Jerusalem streets and walls will
[13:45] be rebuilt despite the perilous times
[13:48] after this period of 434 years the
[13:51] anointed one will be killed
[13:53] Jesus Christ his kingdom will his
[13:56] kingdom still unrealized
[13:58] and a king will arise whose armies will
[14:01] destroy the city and the temple that was
[14:03] Titus they will be overwhelmed with as
[14:05] with a flood and War and its miseries
[14:08] are decreed from that time to the very
[14:10] end
[14:10] this King will make a seven year treaty
[14:13] with the people
[14:16] but after half that time
[14:19] he will break his pledge and stop the
[14:21] Jews from all their sacrifices and their
[14:23] offerings
[14:24] then as I climb I ask to all his
[14:26] terrible Deeds
[14:29] the enemy shall utterly defile the
[14:31] sanctuary of God that's exactly what the
[14:33] prophet said was going to happen right
[14:34] but in God's time and plan his judgment
[14:37] will be poured out upon this evil one
[14:42] he had a revelation
[14:45] he had a revelation of Daniel 70 weeks
[14:47] in the 1500s
[14:48] what's our problem now
[14:51] you may be seated in the Lord at his
[14:52] Blessing to the reading of the word
[14:55] not saying not saying that we could get
[14:58] without brother random but but this is
[15:00] 1500s
[15:02] that a man got a revelation it was 490
[15:05] years
[15:06] 49 years 434 years a man had a
[15:10] revelation
[15:11] it had been hidden and buried
[15:15] and now God brought it to life through
[15:17] the prophet and the end time but if you
[15:18] ever want to uh to look at a Bible that
[15:21] that's read real simple this Tyndale
[15:23] Bible I'm going to keep this one
[15:26] you go get your own but I'm going to
[15:30] keep this one and and brother Mark was
[15:32] reading some things out of it today that
[15:34] would really thrill you that he he's
[15:35] very correct in what he's putting down
[15:37] so I believe it was the Holy Spirit that
[15:39] did it I don't believe it was just a man
[15:40] all right now let's go ahead and put the
[15:43] chart on the board I'm gonna show you
[15:45] we're going to look at the three periods
[15:47] all right because remember there is a
[15:51] 49-year period of 434 year period and a
[15:54] seven year period all right remember
[15:57] when we when we started you got 70 weeks
[16:01] are determined
[16:02] all right seven new weeks 490 years
[16:04] right
[16:06] right right
[16:07] okay thank you 70 weeks are determined
[16:11] upon thy people and the holy city to do
[16:14] six things we're going to talk about
[16:16] that six-fold purpose they happen over
[16:18] here but this is a building up to it
[16:20] here because you got a 49-year period
[16:24] which is seven weeks seven seven brother
[16:26] Brian said one week equals seven years
[16:28] right right so seven seven is 490 right
[16:32] all right 490 years but now seven times
[16:36] seven not seventy seven times seven is
[16:39] 49. they rebuilt the temple in 49 years
[16:42] even the wall remember they built the
[16:45] temple on 46 took them three more years
[16:47] to finish the wall all right
[16:50] then there's a 62-week period read it in
[16:53] your Bible
[16:54] all right 62 and 7 is what
[16:58] Dixie nine 69 times 7 is 483.
[17:04] brother Brown never said and the Bible
[17:06] never says that they're 69 and a half
[17:08] weeks left
[17:10] because all the people in the message
[17:12] and I say all all but a few
[17:14] preach that there's three and a half
[17:15] years of Jesus's ministry here and three
[17:18] and a half over there but they've got it
[17:19] way out over here that is not correct
[17:23] they're not saying what the prophet's
[17:24] saying
[17:25] that's right
[17:27] they're not right but but they're not
[17:29] saying what the Bible said brother Carly
[17:32] 62 and 7 is 69 that's what the Bible
[17:35] says after 62 weeks and my size cut off
[17:39] but not for himself he paid all the debt
[17:43] right here amen right Corey Israel and
[17:47] for us
[17:49] but a pardon is not a pardon until it's
[17:51] accepted as a pardon
[17:53] we accepted it because we were the bride
[17:55] that he came after
[17:58] but remember when he started his
[18:00] ministry back here
[18:02] and all I found some things and I'll
[18:03] show them to Dad we may we may do it
[18:05] again but but I found some things in
[18:08] history
[18:09] where it proves that Jesus was killed in
[18:12] 80 30 and that his ministry started in
[18:14] about 80 26 which we already proved that
[18:17] but even by I had uh pulled up a few
[18:20] dates on the computer and uh thank God
[18:23] for that that you can search things
[18:24] right
[18:25] and and shows at 80 27 he was born in 4
[18:28] BC and then we come up here to 80 30 but
[18:31] now let me just tell you something
[18:33] you're going to see in the book and
[18:36] you're going to see through the message
[18:37] brother Brown talks about 80 33. all
[18:40] right well don't get all flustered
[18:42] because
[18:43] I don't know the man's name but he's got
[18:45] a name about this long he changed the
[18:48] calendar
[18:49] they don't even know why he changed it
[18:52] four years
[18:53] Troy cook from bc4 he put Jesus's birth
[18:56] at 81. and from 81 they'd make it 8033
[19:01] according to their calendar but not
[19:04] according to the prophetic calendar that
[19:05] brother Branham used he was killed in 80
[19:08] 30. and for those people that think that
[19:11] he was wrong before the seals and he was
[19:13] right after the seals on The Sixth Seal
[19:15] he said Jesus was killed in 80 30.
[19:19] the prophet is not confused if we have
[19:22] confusion it's our confusion not his and
[19:27] he cannot preach anything outside of
[19:29] what the Bible says or he's not a word
[19:31] Prophet amen all right so the Bible says
[19:34] there's
[19:36] seven weeks 62 weeks and one week
[19:42] brother Brown says there's three
[19:43] distinct periods
[19:46] everybody understand that can everybody
[19:48] see that
[19:50] she means to understand oh man there's
[19:53] the Bible says
[19:55] right 70 weeks are determined to do six
[19:58] things
[19:59] we're going to talk about the sixth full
[20:01] purpose but we got a bill to that so six
[20:03] things happens inside of this Daniel 70
[20:06] weeks right here six things happen right
[20:09] here
[20:11] not right here
[20:15] see because most people in the message
[20:17] believe that Jesus preached three and a
[20:19] half year three and a half here in the
[20:21] 70th week ends right here
[20:23] and that's not according to the prophet
[20:25] that is not according to the Bible
[20:29] and that's not according to what prophet
[20:30] saying
[20:32] the chart what he said in the Bible is
[20:34] all correct
[20:36] right right
[20:37] I know some of you know this but some of
[20:39] you may not and we went through it real
[20:41] fast the other day I thought I'd come
[20:43] back and just work on a section at a
[20:45] time all right
[20:46] but it can't be that the 70th week
[20:49] cannot end here and I'll prove it
[20:52] tonight
[20:53] because of that six-fold purpose because
[20:57] it says 70 weeks are determined that
[20:59] word determined means I'm going to do it
[21:01] God can't change his mind
[21:04] God can't come down since 1963 and
[21:07] change his mind
[21:09] so he didn't change a prophet's mind
[21:12] the prophet caught the mind of God
[21:15] and gave us a revelation all right
[21:18] but we just don't understand what the
[21:20] prophet said I believe
[21:22] I believe he's right
[21:25] but I have to base everything I go on by
[21:27] the scripture the scripture says there's
[21:30] a seven week period read it in your
[21:31] Bible
[21:33] they built the walls
[21:36] 49 years
[21:38] 62 weeks and my size cut off after 62
[21:41] weeks after 62 weeks and my size cut off
[21:45] 62 plus 7 is 69 right not 69 and a half
[21:49] brother Brown never never never never
[21:52] never said they were 69 and a half years
[21:56] finished right he said they're 69 years
[21:59] finished and there's one week left for
[22:02] the Jews now there's only 1260 days of
[22:07] Jesus's Ministry left
[22:16] he's got three and a half years to
[22:20] redeem Israel amen that's the Bible 1260
[22:23] days
[22:25] but what are you going to do about
[22:26] bringing in Everlasting righteousness
[22:27] sail up the vision and prophecy and
[22:29] anoint the most holy you can't do that
[22:31] in 1260 days because after 1260 days
[22:34] these two guys are killed
[22:36] they take a rapture
[22:38] and battle of Armageddon starts
[22:41] you can't bring in Everlasting
[22:42] righteousness right here
[22:45] you can't seal up Division and prophecy
[22:47] here
[22:48] you can't anoint the most holy here
[22:50] because brother round said that was when
[22:51] we come back into Millennium well the
[22:52] millennium's not here
[22:54] we're heading into the Millennium right
[22:56] here
[22:58] there's a blending or a lap over
[23:01] see these Church ages even for those of
[23:03] you that are new brother Branham said
[23:05] and I believe God doesn't just abruptly
[23:08] stop one thing because he knows we're
[23:09] human
[23:11] one age blended into the next age
[23:14] to be really correct you would take and
[23:17] put this so close till it would laugh
[23:19] over
[23:21] but brother Ram talks with a lamp over
[23:23] so there there's not a there's not a
[23:25] time in here when God doesn't deal with
[23:26] anybody you understand right right God
[23:29] dealt with Paul Paul come in and
[23:31] preached the people took his message
[23:33] through and started around said they
[23:34] start going down God sent another
[23:36] messenger irenus in the lamp over to
[23:39] preach his message and then the people
[23:41] because I read a lot of these people a
[23:43] lot of these Church days Messengers did
[23:44] not live all the way during the time
[23:47] coach Columbus is like a thousand and
[23:49] something years well he only preached a
[23:51] certain amount of time right so who
[23:53] carried the message
[23:55] the people did the people caught the
[23:58] revelation
[23:59] of what was going on in that age and
[24:02] They carried it on but then as the
[24:04] church age kept going
[24:06] it started being eat down again by
[24:09] Creeds and denominations and false
[24:11] Doctrine so God had to send another man
[24:13] Luther on the scene preach a message
[24:16] right here then here comes a message
[24:18] then here's Wesley comes on the scene
[24:20] then you got a Pentecostal age in here
[24:23] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[24:25] then you got brother Brown coming at the
[24:26] End of the Age he coming in he's coming
[24:29] at the end to carry us into the rapture
[24:31] not eight Messengers there are seven
[24:33] churches Messengers but his real message
[24:36] started at the end in the seals
[24:38] right right his real message started in
[24:41] a seal now not that 47-63 was not any
[24:44] good no
[24:46] 47-63 to restore us to restore
[24:48] everything back that they had died that
[24:50] had been eat down over here in Paul's
[24:53] age
[24:53] one God water baptism no eternal hell
[24:56] all those things had to be brought back
[24:58] into the church for what to get us out
[25:01] of here
[25:03] you can't be raptured on part word
[25:06] somebody's got to take a body chain Amen
[25:08] to call the ones that do have part work
[25:10] right out of the ground oh oh they
[25:14] without us
[25:16] they without us cannot be made perfect
[25:20] you think something's on your shoulders
[25:22] tonight
[25:23] every Christian that went to church
[25:27] followed their messenger and died
[25:30] are waiting on me and you that's right
[25:34] to call them out of the ground that's
[25:36] right man
[25:37] you think we're going to take it with
[25:39] one word off
[25:40] you gonna think we take it with well
[25:43] Daniel 70 weeks is not important because
[25:45] it's to the Jews yeah it is
[25:48] the spiritual part
[25:51] we get the revelation of what's going to
[25:53] happen
[25:56] what is what was what is and what is to
[25:58] come right
[26:01] talking about the seals right that which
[26:03] was which is and that is to come all
[26:06] right everybody understand that
[26:08] God had to break in here he was cut off
[26:12] read your scripture Jesus was cut off
[26:14] but not for himself
[26:15] amen right he was cut off for me and you
[26:18] man me and you didn't stand here and say
[26:20] let his blood be on us and our children
[26:22] no when it come on today of Pentecost it
[26:25] the baptism of the Holy Ghost came into
[26:26] a group of people and they accepted what
[26:28] Christ said amen but you stood there and
[26:31] said let his blood be on us and our
[26:32] children they were cut off right right
[26:35] God didn't deal with the Jews no more
[26:38] now I'm talking about the the Jews over
[26:40] there I'm not talking about the Jews
[26:41] these Jews that come in these ages right
[26:43] here everybody understand that when we
[26:46] say Jew don't think of the whole nation
[26:48] of Jerusalem right because some of the
[26:50] people there's Jews that receive the
[26:52] Holy Ghost and in the message now right
[26:54] right that's not the 144 000. God's
[26:58] dealing with a gentile church until here
[27:01] now brother Brandon put this little lap
[27:03] over because the Jews were returning
[27:07] right right in the 40s the Jews began to
[27:10] return and become a nation in 1949
[27:13] brother Brown gave him a little laugh
[27:14] over there right
[27:17] because this Stone right here that comes
[27:19] down we don't talk about it but remember
[27:21] in Daniel
[27:23] 234 it costs about that stone not made
[27:26] by hands rolling down the mountain
[27:29] and what does it do it comes in it Smits
[27:31] this image in the feet
[27:33] ten toes those are Gentile kingdoms
[27:37] Gentile ages he's got to strike them in
[27:41] the feet and get rid of them
[27:45] because he's fixing to deal with the
[27:46] Jews
[27:48] and the Jews only
[27:50] he deals with the Gentiles
[27:54] as individuals
[27:57] he deals with the Jews right here he's
[27:59] going to be 144 000 not 144 and one
[28:03] or 139 and 9. there's 12
[28:07] there's 12 tribes
[28:10] right
[28:11] twelve thousand in each tribe that's 144
[28:14] 000 people God's going to call by these
[28:17] two Prophets
[28:19] by the word of the Lord and they're
[28:20] going to receive the Holy Ghost and then
[28:22] they're going to take a rapture
[28:24] that's what we were trying to show you
[28:25] the other day daddy kind of just put the
[28:27] he put the dates in excuse me
[28:30] but I'm trying to show that that this is
[28:33] more than just then just um uh on a
[28:36] piece of paper with 80 30 and 80 70 and
[28:38] all this which is good brother Brown
[28:40] grew this chart the chart's right
[28:42] sure right the chart's perfect all right
[28:46] but we got to understand what he's
[28:48] talking about but I you got to see
[28:50] Redemption
[28:51] 70 weeks are determined
[28:53] remember what I read in tyndale's Bible
[28:56] to bring Israel back God's got to do
[28:59] these six things but what he done he
[29:01] come at Calvary and paid the price for
[29:03] everybody
[29:05] everybody's Redemption everybody's sin
[29:08] everybody's iniquity was finished at
[29:10] Calvary
[29:11] right we just took it in and he applied
[29:15] it to a gentile bride that's the Rachel
[29:18] he was looking for
[29:19] when he was working those seven years
[29:23] right but he's not gonna forget Israel
[29:27] but it's not Israel as a nation
[29:30] as far as the nation of Israel it's a
[29:32] hundred and forty four thousand so when
[29:34] we're talking about Redemption it's not
[29:36] of all Israel they're going to die just
[29:38] like the rest of them
[29:41] sure there's a fifth seal Jew and
[29:43] there's people that's going to be giving
[29:44] eternal life but this is two prophets
[29:46] bringing out 144 000 people no more no
[29:50] less
[29:51] they preached 1260 days and they bring
[29:54] out a group of people called 144 000. we
[29:57] take a Rapture by what Jesus did at
[30:00] Calvary and they rejected it but God
[30:03] comes back
[30:04] finish is dealing with us when when when
[30:07] the Gentiles reject it we go into chaos
[30:10] then God comes and starts
[30:14] dealing with the Jews
[30:16] but he's not just dealing with the Jews
[30:18] himself he's got to get the city
[30:20] involved
[30:21] that Temple has got to be built amen
[30:24] right
[30:25] and it's not being built inside here
[30:27] right
[30:29] right this is the Redemption of the 144
[30:32] 000. all right so now let's go through
[30:34] some quotes
[30:38] and I'll give I'll get over here where
[30:39] you can see
[30:42] you see that okay
[30:43] there's three distinct periods not four
[30:47] not one two three four
[30:50] there's one where they built the city
[30:53] way back in in BC 538 in there all right
[30:58] then during this time God is dealing
[31:02] with the Jews
[31:03] but he's working to the time to write
[31:05] here Calvary
[31:07] 70 weeks are determined so there's 483
[31:10] years which is 69 weeks so 69 weeks is
[31:14] history we can read that in the Bible
[31:17] all right and there's one week left for
[31:19] the Redemption of the 144 000 and that
[31:22] City to lap us over into the millennium
[31:26] all right but remember one thing
[31:30] let's go get hung up with tribulation
[31:32] and Great Tribulation
[31:34] we're going to talk about this next
[31:36] Sunday so I'm going to try to stay here
[31:37] this is the Tribulation period right
[31:39] here for the Gentiles
[31:43] and Jacob's trouble but we'll read all
[31:45] that next Sunday
[31:47] but I just want to make sure you see
[31:49] those three distinct periods according
[31:52] to scripture I do not care and I want
[31:54] you to look at me I do not care
[31:57] what you think about it
[32:01] I don't want what you think about it
[32:04] the Bible says 69 weeks are finished
[32:08] 7 and 62 is 69 not 69 and a half
[32:15] because you know what it is
[32:17] brothers that's misinterpreted theology
[32:19] just like my brother around talk about
[32:21] marriage and divorce misinterpreted
[32:23] theology people hear somebody preach
[32:25] something it's famous in the message
[32:28] right come on somebody we've been
[32:30] sitting there listening too
[32:32] and you just take it and suck it down
[32:34] like it's true and never go check it out
[32:37] the Bible says there's only three
[32:39] periods a seven a 62 and a seven to make
[32:43] 490 years
[32:45] of the Redemption of Israel and the city
[32:48] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[32:51] Jews 144 000 and the holy city which is
[32:55] what Jerusalem where do you think that
[32:57] Temple is going to be built
[33:00] Omar up
[33:01] commercial Omar setting over where the
[33:04] city spoke or where the Temple's going
[33:05] to be built
[33:07] read Matthew 24. Jesus told them as long
[33:11] as this thing sits here it's going to be
[33:13] an abomination
[33:15] but watch brother Brown said they're
[33:17] gonna put a bomb right down in the
[33:18] middle of that thing and blow it to
[33:20] Pieces why
[33:21] get it out of the way so God can come
[33:24] down in that 144 000 can come down and
[33:27] build that Temple the real Temple that
[33:30] God wants to be built but you know what
[33:31] he's already built that temple in me and
[33:33] you
[33:34] sacrificing offerings I would it's not
[33:37] but a body thou has prepared me he wants
[33:40] us to be a sacrifice we'll talk about
[33:42] Sunday about purging brother Ram talks
[33:44] about purging us that's what happens in
[33:46] the seven in the Seven Seals the Seven
[33:48] Seals is the purging of me and you six
[33:51] seal is a purging that is a six cell is
[33:53] a tribulation period right we'll get
[33:55] into that Sunday I'm not going to be on
[33:56] the seals tonight I actually might not
[33:58] get finished with what I got but we
[33:59] thank God we got Sunday
[34:01] but the sixth see Revelation 6 1-19
[34:05] happens right in here
[34:07] seals break to the Natural Jew
[34:10] s plagues
[34:12] Lowe's
[34:14] woman in the sun red dragon we'll read
[34:17] it in a man where brother Brown calls
[34:18] all that is going to take place in the
[34:21] Redemption of Israel because what
[34:23] happens when the red dragon is standing
[34:25] there waiting for that woman
[34:28] Church to give birth
[34:31] what happens when she gives birth
[34:33] remember
[34:35] two Wings carry her into the
[34:39] into the uh forest for three and a half
[34:43] years
[34:44] I wanted to work three and a half years
[34:45] no problem
[34:48] the Redemption of Israel what are we
[34:50] going to do we're giving birth to Jesus
[34:52] Christ and we're going to hand what
[34:53] we're talking about tonight right to
[34:55] those two prophets all right not
[34:57] physically right
[34:58] but as the word breaks to me and you
[35:01] like dad's been preaching about Satan
[35:03] Satan just know does not know how to
[35:06] Incarnate a man
[35:08] let God incarnates you and I but he's a
[35:12] copier after
[35:14] when you and I stand here and take a
[35:16] body change without death Satan's going
[35:19] to be standing right there
[35:22] and he's going to know how it's done so
[35:24] when we go up he's going to not
[35:25] physically come down we know he's down
[35:27] here but I believe he will be right here
[35:29] because he's not going to be in heaven
[35:31] accusing us because they won't be
[35:32] nothing to accuse us for
[35:36] right so he's got
[35:39] effort and when he incarnates that fault
[35:41] that uh beef
[35:43] he starts as a little saying you know
[35:45] today Israel
[35:47] did somebody get the email yeah Israel
[35:50] recognized the pope right as being you
[35:53] know a good guy the the right person or
[35:57] calling to Christ right
[36:00] come on people this thing's closer than
[36:02] we think right because we're not here
[36:05] when that contract is signed between
[36:08] the uh
[36:10] I won't call him the Antichrist but when
[36:11] it's when it's signed between Rome
[36:13] because it says when he breaks when
[36:15] he'll make a covenant with many for one
[36:17] week who's he going to make covenant
[36:18] with natural Jew
[36:21] 144 000 is going to be in there all
[36:24] right so now that we got that basis
[36:26] let's look at now quote number one
[36:33] get everybody see that now I'm not in
[36:35] anybody's way
[36:36] all right so now now this is in the 17th
[36:38] week of Daniel now now let's outline
[36:40] Daniel 70 of weeks now I might repeat
[36:42] here again Ministers of the Gospel if
[36:44] you disagree with this all right
[36:46] they're divided in three periods as we
[36:49] find out in Daniel 9 three periods first
[36:51] a seven week period
[36:54] then a three score and two which three
[36:56] score is
[36:58] three times two is six that's sixty
[37:01] and then two make sixty two all right
[37:04] everybody got that
[37:05] then a three scoring two which is 62. uh
[37:08] he did it for me and then a one week
[37:11] period they're divided in three
[37:13] different periods he didn't say four and
[37:15] he didn't say those periods were divided
[37:17] up there's three distinct periods
[37:21] now I've got a divided here on the board
[37:23] the first period second period now watch
[37:25] this and to my understanding by the
[37:27] gospel by the Holy Spirit
[37:30] and they think brother Brown was wrong
[37:31] when he was preaching the damn 70 weeks
[37:33] then they're calling the Holy Spirit
[37:35] wrong
[37:37] God forbid
[37:39] by the holy spirit that the end that the
[37:42] end time God returns again
[37:44] to the Jew all right let's go
[37:48] to number two
[37:51] it's the sixth full purpose 70 weeks are
[37:53] determined now this is what we're going
[37:55] to talk about tonight the 70 weeks are
[37:57] determined upon thy people for what
[37:59] purpose for what
[38:01] whose people was it determined upon
[38:03] Daniel's people the Jews and what was it
[38:07] determined for upon not only Daniel but
[38:10] upon Daniel's Holy City so he's telling
[38:12] you there's two parts to that this
[38:15] people and the city it's Bible the Bible
[38:18] says this people and the city all right
[38:20] and upon Daniels public city see
[38:23] Daniel's holy city now class what was
[38:25] Daniel's Holy City
[38:27] Jerusalem amen all right now I want you
[38:31] to know friends that striking on these
[38:33] things I'm certainly leaving out weeks
[38:35] of teaching but just kind of hitting it
[38:37] so that when the weather cooled off for
[38:39] a little later when we get into those
[38:40] Seven Seals seven balls seven trumpets
[38:42] all these things that I can refer back
[38:44] and say do you remember on the 70 weeks
[38:46] of Daniel do you remember the church age
[38:48] when it went up and what takes place in
[38:50] these 70 weeks of Daniel colors listen
[38:53] these 70 weeks
[38:56] covers
[39:00] from the going up of the church
[39:04] until the coming back of the church
[39:08] that space is what it covers now now not
[39:10] all 70 weeks of Daniel part of it
[39:14] because remember the 62 and the Seven
[39:16] was bringing it up to Calvary
[39:18] all right everybody got that
[39:21] okay all right
[39:23] 70 weeks are determined now there was a
[39:25] six-fold purpose in his visit telling
[39:29] him what was going to come to pass now
[39:31] there was a six-fold purpose of his
[39:33] coming so does everybody understand in
[39:36] that 70 weeks there's got to be that six
[39:38] full purpose
[39:39] well that shows the Redemption of them
[39:41] in the city 70 weeks are determined I
[39:44] want to grill out in your head there's a
[39:46] whole key 70 weeks are determined upon
[39:48] my people and the holy city to do 16.
[39:51] succeed
[39:53] whatever you want to call it same thing
[39:56] at 70 weeks are determined upon thy
[39:58] people now remember that is all that the
[40:01] Journey of the Israelites will have in
[40:04] this earth
[40:06] right
[40:07] they are determined 70 weeks is just
[40:10] determined that's all that's slotted to
[40:12] the Jews upon thy people and upon thy
[40:15] holy city therefore this seventy weeks
[40:17] now don't miss it
[40:19] it will reveal from that time to the end
[40:23] of the Jews and also to the end of
[40:26] Jerusalem
[40:28] blown off the map
[40:30] so they can come back and build the
[40:32] temple right until there'll be a new
[40:35] City built
[40:39] my people and the city has to be
[40:42] redeemed
[40:44] that means they had to fall somewhere to
[40:46] be brought back
[40:47] Israel turned God down at Calvary and
[40:51] was put away right in Jeremiah
[40:54] adulterous Israel was divorced
[41:00] so he could take us he can't be married
[41:02] to two he married us all right then the
[41:04] Jews come back as servants but I listen
[41:06] now don't miss this it will reveal from
[41:09] that time to the end of the Jews and
[41:11] also to the end of Jerusalem until
[41:13] there'll be a new City built now oh I
[41:15] hope we get into it real good and deep
[41:17] tonight are determined upon thy people
[41:20] and upon thy holy city what too then he
[41:23] starts going with to finish the
[41:24] transgression now let's go back to
[41:26] Daniel 9 24.
[41:29] 70 weeks
[41:30] are determined upon thy people and upon
[41:33] that Holy City to do six things one
[41:36] finish the transgression two make an end
[41:38] of sins agree to make reconciliation for
[41:41] iniquity four to bring in Everlasting
[41:43] righteousness five to seal of division
[41:45] and prophecy and six to anoint the most
[41:47] holy everybody understand that's got to
[41:49] happen in 70 weeks not 69 and a half
[41:52] 70 weeks the 70 weeks of Daniel those
[41:56] six things are going to happen all right
[41:57] now
[42:00] the six-fold purpose
[42:02] what does it do it redeems 144 thousand
[42:07] and gets the city back to where it's
[42:09] supposed to be because when we come
[42:10] right into the city it's not going to be
[42:12] a half-built city
[42:14] it's going to be built right
[42:16] all right but I want you to listen to
[42:18] One Thing
[42:21] I'm going to tell you in a minute but
[42:23] let's just let's just drop it in right
[42:25] now for a second
[42:27] these things happen
[42:31] not for us
[42:36] when we think a Rapture we're done amen
[42:40] when we take a rapture we take a body
[42:42] change right when we go up we're done
[42:45] that's right we're eternal
[42:48] the wedding supper is where we go and
[42:51] meet and greet each person sit down at
[42:53] the marriage supper with Abraham Isaac
[42:54] and Jacob wherever how you want to say
[42:56] that he'll wipe the tears from your eyes
[42:58] we'll get to meet and greet each one of
[43:01] us he slips out the prophet's head and
[43:03] goes down to the 144 000 reveals itself
[43:07] to them right amen then they're killed
[43:11] they go in a Rapture and I believe I'll
[43:14] I'll try to prove it Sunday they turn
[43:16] around and come right back down here and
[43:18] start building the city it
[43:20] they got to build the temple we don't
[43:22] know how to do that we're gentiles we
[43:24] lived in caves
[43:25] they built temples
[43:27] they need more about temples than
[43:28] anybody so I believe they're going to
[43:30] build a temple brother Brown said God
[43:32] wouldn't help why would you want to when
[43:35] Donnie and Susan got married Donnie
[43:37] brought her back and said honey if you
[43:38] want to live in the house with me you
[43:39] got to build one
[43:41] he'd be sitting alone tonight
[43:46] so why would you take your bride and
[43:48] bring her back and make her build
[43:50] something
[43:51] no the Temple's going to be there for us
[43:54] to come in because we're just in a
[43:55] honeymoon
[43:58] it's not to us
[44:00] the 70 weeks are not to us
[44:04] we're done we're finished
[44:07] there's no more Redemption for us
[44:10] when we come back into Millennium that's
[44:12] not to us
[44:14] brother Ram said we're there on a
[44:15] honeymoon
[44:17] are you gonna work on your honeymoon too
[44:22] not public labor anyway
[44:24] all right so we're not there to do that
[44:28] we're there when we come riding back in
[44:30] Revelations 19 we come back and we're
[44:33] the anointing to the temple and I
[44:35] believe that 144 000 are going to be
[44:38] there I have servants right
[44:41] see our grand finale or whatever you
[44:44] want to call it
[44:46] it's going to be when that future home
[44:47] comes
[44:48] which that's nothing to do with a
[44:50] millennium
[44:51] everybody understand that two different
[44:53] places
[44:55] the Millennium is after the atomic fire
[44:57] blows this place off we walk back on the
[44:59] ashes of the wicked we're not going to
[45:00] walk back on ashes
[45:02] waiting for the future home dog and
[45:04] Magog is going to be the fire of God is
[45:06] going to consume not just burn it's
[45:08] going to consume everything all them
[45:10] little Devils is talking to you right
[45:11] now they're going to be burning up
[45:14] and only God can do that
[45:17] man's fire can't do it but man's fire is
[45:19] going to burn at the Battle alarm again
[45:21] we're going to walk out on the ashes of
[45:23] the wicked live here A Thousand Years
[45:24] but that's not to us so don't worry we
[45:27] have some of the ministers that work
[45:29] well what were we going to be when they
[45:30] do this and do this I don't care
[45:34] somebody asked brother Brown said
[45:36] brother what's this about the Millennium
[45:38] he said maybe babies can be born maybe
[45:40] they can he said I don't know
[45:43] and he never answered it so it doesn't
[45:45] matter get born again get the baptism of
[45:47] the Holy Ghost and you got a free ride
[45:49] right to the Future home right all right
[45:51] right very simple you get a free ride so
[45:55] what if we have to come up do you think
[45:57] it's gonna matter
[45:59] if we come back right in the middle of
[46:01] the battle of Armageddon
[46:04] if you took a body change and you're
[46:06] just as Eternal as God is you think
[46:08] atomic bomb is going to bother you
[46:11] it's just about what it is a bunch of
[46:14] preachers I'll say it on the internet a
[46:16] bunch of preachers that got their
[46:18] doctrines burnt up
[46:20] oh and they got mad about it
[46:23] that's all right listen I was I was
[46:26] thinking today in the shower this
[46:28] morning I thought Lord
[46:30] there are degrees
[46:32] of ministry
[46:36] but when Jesus said eat my flesh and
[46:39] drink my blood
[46:41] he didn't explain it right that's right
[46:43] now listen let me ask you a question
[46:45] have you ever thought of this
[46:47] he explained it in the upper room with
[46:50] the 12 disciples
[46:52] right right but why didn't Peter write
[46:55] about it Peter was there Peter heard him
[46:59] say eat my flesh and drink my blood
[47:00] right
[47:02] because Jesus turned to them afterwards
[47:04] after the 70 left he's turned he said
[47:05] where are you going Peterson's word we
[47:08] ain't got no hurry up
[47:09] you only have the words to eternal life
[47:11] well when they were in the upper room
[47:12] Jesus said this is my body which is
[47:14] broken for you take eat
[47:16] this is my blood and and represents of
[47:18] the New Testament in my blood drink it
[47:23] who had the revelation of that
[47:26] Paul
[47:27] I wasn't there
[47:29] but he said I have received of the Lord
[47:33] that's what he's commanded for me to do
[47:35] the night in which he was betrayed
[47:37] do you understand what I'm saying I'm
[47:39] giving you a parable
[47:41] Paul was a wonderful priest I mean Peter
[47:43] was a wonderful preacher but he didn't
[47:44] have a revelation like Paul had
[47:48] right and but you know what Peter never
[47:50] huffed up and puffed up no he just said
[47:52] Paul said some things hard to be
[47:54] understood
[47:55] he didn't say he didn't agree with him
[47:57] he just said he said some things wasn't
[47:58] hard to be understood so if we say some
[48:01] things that are to be understood
[48:03] I'll pray to God because we've got the
[48:04] same Holy Ghost right but but we can't
[48:07] we can't disallow that that part of this
[48:10] is no good
[48:11] our part of this is to the Jews and we
[48:13] don't need it
[48:14] no I believe we got to have an
[48:16] understanding
[48:17] before we get out of here
[48:20] of what we need to get out here with
[48:22] right brother Brown said wrapping faith
[48:24] lies in the books on the tapes right all
[48:26] right so that's my that's what I'm going
[48:28] to rely on what's in the books and
[48:30] what's on the tapes all right
[48:33] but God doesn't deal with Israel he
[48:35] doesn't do any of this until we leave
[48:37] right not sure he's building up I just
[48:39] believe that the two prophets are
[48:40] already over there
[48:42] there they are
[48:44] because when that message comes from us
[48:47] and I'm going to give you a challenge
[48:50] because what you have
[48:53] goes over there to them right right amen
[48:57] so your revelation
[48:59] better be like Daniel 9 24.
[49:05] or you give them a different Revelation
[49:07] amen right right that's right your
[49:11] revelation
[49:12] better be the same as what the Bible
[49:15] says and what that Prophet preaches or
[49:17] it don't go to Israel
[49:19] because they're not going up they're not
[49:21] gonna we're not going to introduce error
[49:23] to the the children of Israel
[49:25] right there's been enough air over there
[49:28] now
[49:28] right amen so we're not going to
[49:31] introduce era but but explaining this
[49:36] helps me see how they're going to
[49:37] receive it
[49:39] what's going to happen to them but also
[49:41] it shows what God's doing to me amen
[49:43] God's doing the same thing to me amen
[49:46] all right that's my bro that's my
[49:47] brother Dale said it's a parable it's a
[49:50] parable
[49:51] with an underlying meaning when we get
[49:53] the underlying meaning that God's
[49:55] dealing with us now and then he's going
[49:58] to take this same message
[50:00] not chopped up and saying well brother
[50:02] man what's wrong here and right here and
[50:04] he didn't know what he's saying here and
[50:05] he got his numbers wrong here that's
[50:07] going to go to Israel they're going to
[50:09] go
[50:10] same old stuff we had before bring a
[50:13] false doctrine of water baptism and or
[50:16] or even you know three gods or
[50:18] trinitarian doctrine you're not gonna
[50:20] feed a geotranitarian Doctrine that's
[50:22] one thing they do have straight there's
[50:24] only one God that's right
[50:26] they just don't know that Jesus is him
[50:28] but when we when we take this message
[50:30] over there
[50:32] it's going to be what one God and Jesus
[50:35] is his name all right so now
[50:38] let's see quote number three
[50:40] but I don't remember our Redemption has
[50:43] to be finished first
[50:45] all right so now
[50:47] making signs with Jesus now I want to
[50:49] show you
[50:51] I Want to Break Down The Book of
[50:52] Revelations just so you can understand
[50:54] maybe for the new ones maybe for some
[50:56] that that don't really understand us and
[50:59] now I would like to think would be this
[51:00] Brethren that like in the church here my
[51:02] Minister my Ministry has the best of my
[51:04] thinking four things that can be done
[51:06] and it might not be either four but
[51:08] that's the only Outlook I can think of
[51:10] if that one has spoke to me down there
[51:12] in the river if this is all that was
[51:13] left for the Gentile Church which we
[51:15] realize in Revelations it's just one two
[51:18] three chapters to the church
[51:21] Revelations one through three is to the
[51:24] Gentile Church
[51:26] the church goes up in the fourth chapter
[51:28] it does not return anymore till the 19th
[51:31] Chapter that's after the tribulation
[51:34] period when God calls out the Jews
[51:38] does everybody understand that say Amen
[51:40] amen all right
[51:43] but now let's go take four to 19 and
[51:46] take it out of the bottle and throw it
[51:47] away oh that's just to the Jews we don't
[51:49] need it no we got to take the revelation
[51:51] of what it is to them that's right right
[51:53] it's been here for them all right so now
[51:56] let's break it down just a minute I
[51:57] wanna
[51:59] I hope they put this together right I
[52:01] know they did yeah that's right that's
[52:03] among that's my guys all right
[52:06] we're gonna break Revelations down
[52:09] Revelations chapter one two three he
[52:11] speaks of the Bride in the church ages
[52:13] is that correct
[52:14] Say Amen all right Revelations one to
[52:17] three now Revelation is 4 1 it says come
[52:20] up hither right that's the Rapture of
[52:22] the church the bride
[52:25] all right now chapter four shows the
[52:27] bride and Glory brother Dale's been
[52:29] through this that's the Heavenly scene a
[52:32] round about The Throne the four elders
[52:34] and and the four beasts wherever the
[52:36] four B Stars Where We Are
[52:38] right wherever those four beasts are
[52:41] that's where we are because that's the
[52:43] Holy Ghost so wherever the Holy Ghost is
[52:44] that's where we are better be
[52:47] or you got another Holy Ghost
[52:49] chapter five shows how we are redeemed
[52:53] lamb takes the book well when that lamb
[52:56] takes the book what is it seven horns
[52:58] and seven eyes
[52:59] he's redeeming through the church ages
[53:02] and when he gets the book and I thought
[53:04] about this this morning have you ever
[53:05] thought about this
[53:08] they're in there somewhere
[53:12] they're in that book
[53:14] right
[53:16] they got to be redeemed so they're in
[53:18] the book of redemption
[53:20] right so they're in there it's not that
[53:23] they're going to show up somewhere later
[53:25] no this shows our Redemption because we
[53:27] got to be redeemed first
[53:29] amen then what we got goes to them for
[53:31] Redemption so Revelations chapter 6
[53:34] through 18 is the Redemption of the 144
[53:37] 000 in the purging of the Earth
[53:41] see what tells you that all right
[53:43] then Revelation chapter 19 we come
[53:46] riding into the Millennium with the 144
[53:49] 000 for the Millennium the white throne
[53:52] and then the future home
[53:54] does everybody see that lineup that's
[53:56] how the Book of Revelations is lined up
[54:00] everybody see that same minutes amen
[54:02] amen you see that
[54:04] that's how the Book of Revelation that's
[54:06] why we have to have it straight but now
[54:08] I'm just like brother Claude but Claude
[54:10] said that one you know the brother said
[54:12] well we don't need
[54:14] uh the Rev we don't need Revelations 6
[54:16] 1-19 because that's to the Jews
[54:19] well if you do you got a big old Gap
[54:22] right here
[54:24] because this is for our Redemption
[54:28] brother Brandon preached us to this
[54:30] right here
[54:31] so he must have brought all this right
[54:34] or God wouldn't have let him preach on
[54:36] this right here
[54:37] he brought that future home where I love
[54:39] it I love the future home book I love
[54:41] that book
[54:42] because it tells you everything tells
[54:44] you about justification sanctification
[54:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost he tells you
[54:48] the difference in the Millennium and the
[54:50] future home because of Millennium people
[54:51] do build houses and have it but in that
[54:53] future home that's all built by God
[54:56] right that's built the prophet said by
[54:58] your desire
[54:59] he's already got it built and it's going
[55:01] to sit right there on top of that
[55:02] mountain that's going to push up over
[55:04] there in Jerusalem that city is going to
[55:06] sit right down on top of it that pyramid
[55:08] city is going to sit down right on top
[55:10] of that mountain and we're going to walk
[55:12] in there and we're going to be the light
[55:14] 144 000 is going to be there as servants
[55:17] and the rest of the world is going to
[55:19] come in and out but they can't stay they
[55:22] got to go out
[55:23] all right
[55:24] what a wonderful wonderful wonderful
[55:26] thing to have a prophet to bring us this
[55:28] and show now see I can see
[55:32] where I'm placed at and where Israel is
[55:35] placed at but I got to see through that
[55:37] Revelation 6 through 18 shows my
[55:40] Redemption also right right but it's
[55:43] going to be a natural happening to the
[55:45] Jews because see the book is still
[55:47] closed in chapter five right
[55:50] actually like Dad said the other day he
[55:52] said Revelation 6 1 to 6 1 does not say
[55:55] the book's open but we know it is
[55:56] because he begins to reveal but if you
[55:59] take six one to 18 and you say it's not
[56:01] to us then we're still talking about a
[56:03] closed book
[56:04] right but opens during that time
[56:08] of Revelation 6 to 19. the book opens so
[56:12] that we can see what's going on same
[56:14] thing with
[56:15] Hey look
[56:17] God blinded Israel so we could come in
[56:20] right right
[56:23] God blinded Israel so we could come in
[56:27] Creeds and dogmas blinded us so we
[56:30] couldn't go in but God had to come the
[56:32] same way and open our eyes just like
[56:35] he's going to Open the Eyes of the 144
[56:37] thousand
[56:38] for their Redemption is the same way you
[56:40] and I we walked in darkness when we were
[56:42] alive right
[56:43] what kill God opened our eyes and showed
[56:47] us the truth same thing with 144 000
[56:50] it's just that we get it first because
[56:52] we're the bride he loves us
[56:53] amen he loves us he loves to tell us
[56:55] secrets then we can reveal that secret
[56:58] as it's given out to the laity out to
[57:03] the 144 000 and even to the world
[57:07] I see you got a Redemption of 144 000 in
[57:10] the purging of the earth Revelation 6
[57:12] through 18 because 19 is when we come
[57:15] back
[57:16] into this city we're going to talk about
[57:18] next Sunday all right so everybody see
[57:21] that lineup is that okay
[57:23] all right I would write that down or ask
[57:25] if you can get it it's online you can
[57:27] get it online
[57:29] but I would hang on to that because
[57:33] that's your lineup that tells everything
[57:35] that's going on in the Book of
[57:36] Revelation all right so now placing of
[57:40] these events are important Revelation 6
[57:42] 1-19 has to be revealed to you and I
[57:45] before it goes to Israel
[57:48] amen has to be revealed to us before it
[57:50] goes to Israel all right and now rolling
[57:53] in here I wrote not important question
[57:55] mark let's go to number four
[57:59] Gabriel's instructions to Daniel
[58:01] now look if you want to throw the Daniel
[58:03] 70 weeks book out if you want to throw
[58:05] all of Daniel 70 weeks away here's what
[58:08] a prophet said this is the one most
[58:11] important scripture in the book that's
[58:13] right
[58:15] now brother Brown said Revelations 5 was
[58:17] the most Sublime scripture in the book
[58:20] right right why because it shows our
[58:22] Redemption but this is the one most
[58:24] important scripture in the book what
[58:27] does it do it tells the closing of the
[58:30] Jewish Nation the Jewish people this
[58:32] scripture the 70 of weeks it discloses
[58:35] and tells exactly from the time that
[58:37] Daniel started there until the end of
[58:39] the consummation it's one of the
[58:41] greatest timepieces
[58:44] there's God's calendar taken from right
[58:47] here
[58:48] it has nothing to do with the Gentiles
[58:51] these Seven Seals seven plagues seven
[58:53] woes seven trumpets has not one thing to
[58:56] do the Gentile church will be in glory
[58:58] at that time don't have nothing to do
[59:00] with us the Gentile Church it only deals
[59:02] with Israel Daniel thy people and
[59:05] Jerusalem you notice he keeps saying in
[59:07] Jerusalem and the city all right so
[59:10] let's go to
[59:12] what happens
[59:14] after we leave now we can get into
[59:17] what I want to talk about
[59:19] yeah been an hour the six-fold purpose
[59:23] all right in the 70th week of Daniel
[59:25] where are we at right here
[59:29] he's pulling to that chart
[59:31] where we're at where are we at right
[59:33] here where did the Messiah get cut off
[59:35] exactly where the word said what 80 30
[59:39] when he died he was cut off he was
[59:41] killed we're going to read it in Isaiah
[59:42] 53 he was cut out cut off from among the
[59:45] living right where will that 70th Week
[59:48] begin
[59:49] exactly after this church is cut off
[59:51] then God returns to the Jew all right
[59:55] can you bring that chart up
[59:57] where did a messiah get cut off we know
[1:00:00] that church ages started Church age is
[1:00:02] in exactly after this church us is cut
[1:00:06] off
[1:00:07] then God returns to the Jews where would
[1:00:09] that 70th week
[1:00:11] begin he's cut off here
[1:00:13] when will that 70th Week begin after
[1:00:16] we're cut off because he's not going to
[1:00:18] deal with the Gentiles no more we get
[1:00:20] bad bad tribulation
[1:00:23] right because we turned God down not we
[1:00:25] not us but the church The Remnant the
[1:00:28] nominal people the people's going to be
[1:00:29] hunted down like dogs because you know
[1:00:31] what we're going to be in glory while
[1:00:32] all this happens all right
[1:00:34] so now
[1:00:36] number six
[1:00:40] let's go back to number six quote
[1:00:44] that wind's going to start when's God
[1:00:48] going to start their last week when it
[1:00:50] may be today it may be before the sun
[1:00:52] sets God would declare it when it is
[1:00:55] I don't know because he don't know when
[1:00:57] the Rapture is going to take place all
[1:00:58] right now go number seven
[1:01:06] all right 70th week and in the middle of
[1:01:08] this week now here's the 70 and now
[1:01:10] these exactly was seven years each one
[1:01:13] of the weeks
[1:01:14] one week equals seven years okay and
[1:01:17] we've already
[1:01:24] 69 weeks so we've already had 69 weeks
[1:01:29] then we have the Gentile age he don't
[1:01:32] put no three and a half years over here
[1:01:34] right
[1:01:35] he was he preached that he preached that
[1:01:38] Messiah Doctrine Messiah message before
[1:01:41] that 69th week was cut off right all
[1:01:44] right there
[1:01:47] more than that now we're at the end of
[1:01:49] the Gentile age
[1:01:51] then there's one more week left for the
[1:01:53] Jew
[1:01:54] is that right and that's exactly seven
[1:01:57] years
[1:01:58] if this was seven years that's seven
[1:02:01] years because he said there's 70 weeks
[1:02:03] determined upon thy people so we know we
[1:02:05] got seven years for the Jews is that
[1:02:07] right is that true
[1:02:09] excuse me now look at it if there's a
[1:02:11] question I want to know it and in the
[1:02:13] middle of the week the middle of this
[1:02:14] Jewish
[1:02:16] week
[1:02:18] Jewish remember that Jewish week
[1:02:23] that's three and a half years the
[1:02:25] Antichrist the prince the prince that is
[1:02:27] to come and remember he comes out of
[1:02:29] Rome
[1:02:30] so we know who's going to make a
[1:02:32] covenant for that last week right right
[1:02:34] the Antichrist the Pope
[1:02:37] he's gonna make it with natural Israel
[1:02:39] all of Israel the whole nation 144 000
[1:02:42] is going to be in that group because
[1:02:43] they're going to have to be called out
[1:02:45] because because in Revelation that says
[1:02:47] come out of her my people
[1:02:48] right same thing with you and I we came
[1:02:51] out a denomination but the 144 000 is
[1:02:54] going to come out of that Covenant
[1:02:56] that old Jewish Orthodox Covenant that
[1:02:58] that Rome's going to make with the Jews
[1:03:01] they're going to come out
[1:03:03] and come out of her my people all right
[1:03:06] next three and a half years the
[1:03:07] Antichrist the prince the prince it is
[1:03:09] to come and remember he comes out of
[1:03:10] Rome I press it is to come what is he a
[1:03:13] Poe a prince amongst a people
[1:03:15] that is to come that rise up a pharaoh
[1:03:18] who doesn't know
[1:03:21] Joseph amen
[1:03:22] and that's what it is remember a pharaoh
[1:03:25] rose up that didn't know Joseph so he
[1:03:26] sent him right into captivity all right
[1:03:28] so now there's one lit there so now we
[1:03:31] understand that there's one week left
[1:03:35] for the Redemption of the people in the
[1:03:36] city right
[1:03:38] one week left for the Redemption of the
[1:03:39] people and the city amen all right
[1:03:42] because we got to break that down
[1:03:44] because there's only 1260 days left for
[1:03:46] the Redemption of the people
[1:03:49] what the Bible says 160 days three and a
[1:03:53] half years all right so now
[1:03:56] 69 weeks are complete the bride is gone
[1:03:58] let's go down let's go to Daniel 9 27.
[1:04:01] and he shall confirm that was that guy
[1:04:03] he's talking about he the Antichrist
[1:04:06] right he shall confirm the Covenant with
[1:04:09] many for one week
[1:04:11] I said last part not last week
[1:04:13] and in the midst of the week which is
[1:04:15] what the middle of seven is three and a
[1:04:17] half all right he shall cause the
[1:04:20] sacrifice and the oblation deceased and
[1:04:22] for the overspreading of abomination he
[1:04:24] shall make it best of what's he doing
[1:04:25] he's letting them have their Temple
[1:04:27] worship for three and a half years but
[1:04:29] he gets so mad at those two prophets and
[1:04:31] those 144 000 for coming against that he
[1:04:34] breaks that thing and when he breaks in
[1:04:37] and walks into that Temple and he says
[1:04:39] I'm God
[1:04:40] worship me
[1:04:42] 144 000 are going to be gone
[1:04:45] and what what's Israel going to do
[1:04:48] they're going to know
[1:04:49] that they've transgressed they're going
[1:04:51] to know that all these things are are to
[1:04:54] them
[1:04:55] and they're going to punch a button
[1:04:57] and then
[1:04:58] this country's gonna punch a button and
[1:05:00] then this country is going to punch a
[1:05:02] button it's gonna be Armageddon all
[1:05:04] right does everybody understand that you
[1:05:07] got it
[1:05:07] he makes a covenant with all the Jews
[1:05:10] he the Antichrist
[1:05:13] all right let's go to number eight
[1:05:17] the seventh week now you promised and
[1:05:19] say well now that's it
[1:05:25] the Federation of churches
[1:05:27] an image to the Beast and go right with
[1:05:29] them and we find out here that the Jews
[1:05:32] are called in on this confederation
[1:05:35] what a contract or or something like
[1:05:37] that yes sir and they agree and the
[1:05:39] Bible said they would or did it and he
[1:05:42] makes a covenant with them and in the
[1:05:45] midst of the 70th week for the Jews may
[1:05:48] I I'm not adding I'm telling you what
[1:05:50] he's saying all right that's 70th week
[1:05:52] in the midst of that week he breaks the
[1:05:54] Bible says he breaks the Covenant right
[1:05:57] after three and a half years or in the
[1:05:58] middle of the week he breaks the
[1:06:00] Covenant
[1:06:01] the Antichrist breaks his Covenant with
[1:06:03] the Jews thy people
[1:06:05] why now when you read in Revelations 11
[1:06:08] says I'm sin that's 11 you're coming
[1:06:10] over towards 19 now that he will send
[1:06:13] his two prophets and they'll prophesy in
[1:06:15] that time and when they'll get angry
[1:06:17] with those prophets and actually kill
[1:06:19] them
[1:06:21] right
[1:06:22] right is that right and their dead body
[1:06:24] shall lay in the spiritual street called
[1:06:26] Sodom and Gomorrah where our Lord was
[1:06:27] crucified Jerusalem is that right and
[1:06:30] they'll lay there for three days and
[1:06:32] nights actually it's three and a half
[1:06:33] days three three and a half days and
[1:06:35] after three days and nights the spirit
[1:06:37] of life will come into them and they'll
[1:06:39] be raised up and going to Glory a Kent
[1:06:41] part of the city fell at that time is
[1:06:42] that right see what is it in the middle
[1:06:44] of this last 70 years and he put 70
[1:06:47] years but we know it's 70 weeks in the
[1:06:50] middle of this last
[1:06:51] 70 years
[1:06:53] so let's go to Revelations 11 and let's
[1:06:55] read
[1:06:56] what the Bible says
[1:06:58] it's going to happen
[1:07:00] in that 1260 days
[1:07:03] 11-3 and I will give power unto my two
[1:07:05] witnesses and they shall prophesy a
[1:07:08] thousand two hundred and three score
[1:07:09] days which in a prophetic calendar is
[1:07:12] exactly three and a half years right
[1:07:14] and these are the two olive trees and
[1:07:17] the two candlesticks standing before the
[1:07:19] god of the earth and if in man will hurt
[1:07:21] them
[1:07:22] their mouth and devour their enemy and
[1:07:24] if any man will hurt them he must be in
[1:07:25] this manner he must in this manner be
[1:07:27] killed
[1:07:28] these have power to shut heaven
[1:07:31] brother Brown says what did Elijah do
[1:07:33] three and a half years he walked out and
[1:07:34] said hey they won't even do you fall on
[1:07:36] the ground for three and a half years he
[1:07:38] said they know how to do it because it's
[1:07:39] the same Spirit of Moses and Elijah
[1:07:41] going over here to do these to do bring
[1:07:44] these plagues down now what they're
[1:07:46] doing is they're not just bringing
[1:07:47] plagues what they're preaching
[1:07:50] what their preachings bring into place
[1:07:53] sure they they literally call for these
[1:07:55] things I believe but they're preaching
[1:07:58] they're preaching's what condemns the
[1:08:00] world right brother Branham when he come
[1:08:02] and he condemned the United States that
[1:08:04] condemned the United States there's
[1:08:06] nothing nobody can do about it he's
[1:08:08] condemned us so we're ready I mean we're
[1:08:09] ready to be burnt these have power to
[1:08:12] shut Heaven that it rain not in the days
[1:08:13] of their prophecy and that power over
[1:08:15] Waters to turn into Blood Brother Brown
[1:08:17] said Moses knows how to do that he's
[1:08:19] done it one done before
[1:08:20] and it's mighty Earth with all plagues
[1:08:23] as often as they will and when they
[1:08:25] shall have finished their testimony so
[1:08:27] after 1260 days
[1:08:31] three and a half years all right
[1:08:34] that's a continuation of the Messiah
[1:08:36] Ministry or the Messiah Doctrine brother
[1:08:40] Branham calls it but
[1:08:42] if you ever realized this it's a
[1:08:44] Ministry of the son of man
[1:08:48] the son of man preached his own message
[1:08:50] when he was here
[1:08:52] the Son of Man shows up now right here
[1:08:55] today we're standing in the son of man
[1:08:57] ministry right now amen and then that
[1:09:00] son of man Ministry why do you think
[1:09:02] well how do you know that well
[1:09:05] if you go to the scripture where it says
[1:09:07] where did you get those scars they're
[1:09:08] going to see Jesus so real
[1:09:11] so he's not physically going to be
[1:09:12] standing there but through these two
[1:09:13] prophets that's doing all this they're
[1:09:15] going to be preaching salvation to the
[1:09:17] 144 000. they're going to accept it and
[1:09:20] see so much what Christ did for them
[1:09:22] they're going to say where did you get
[1:09:23] those scars but you get those wounds he
[1:09:25] said I want the house of my friends all
[1:09:27] right and they that dwell upon the Earth
[1:09:29] shall rejoice over them and make marry
[1:09:31] and shall send gifts one to another
[1:09:34] because these two prophets tormented
[1:09:36] them that dwell on the earth and after
[1:09:38] three days and a half the spirit of life
[1:09:40] from God entered into them what can't
[1:09:42] you imagine CNN and Fox News and all
[1:09:45] those cameras being pointed on those two
[1:09:47] witnesses laying in the street and after
[1:09:48] three days over there they're probably
[1:09:50] not looking very well
[1:09:51] you understand what I mean
[1:09:54] they're getting kind of decayed after
[1:09:56] three days at least they're blowing up
[1:09:58] but after three and a half days
[1:10:01] something's gonna happen behind a
[1:10:03] reporter that's that's reporting this
[1:10:04] thing
[1:10:05] them two men is going to stand up on
[1:10:07] their feet
[1:10:10] by the mighty God we serve
[1:10:12] and after three days and a half the
[1:10:14] spirit of life from God entered into
[1:10:16] them and they stood upon their feet in
[1:10:17] great fear now don't you think the world
[1:10:20] after they after they probably had a
[1:10:22] Super Bowl party yeah the these two guys
[1:10:24] are dead because they just torment day
[1:10:26] and night just torment the people over
[1:10:28] there and there's nothing they can do
[1:10:30] about it but see that Spirit just lift
[1:10:32] off of him so that Jesus can be
[1:10:33] crucified that Spirit left off of them
[1:10:36] so that they can be killed right
[1:10:39] when they're killed man they're going to
[1:10:41] be having a like I said a Super Bowl
[1:10:42] party with with you know they're going
[1:10:44] to have serve them chicken wings and all
[1:10:46] that other stuff
[1:10:47] you understand what I'm saying because
[1:10:48] it's it's people this is America it's
[1:10:51] Frolic and I mean the whole world are
[1:10:53] going to say finally
[1:10:55] these people are gone and then all of a
[1:10:57] sudden they're going to look and these
[1:10:59] two guys are going to stand up on their
[1:11:00] feet you talking about a hush
[1:11:03] you go by silence in Heaven Ain't gonna
[1:11:06] be silence on Earth
[1:11:08] right
[1:11:09] could you imagine go with having cameras
[1:11:12] of the whole world looking right down on
[1:11:14] these two dead guys laying in the street
[1:11:15] and they don't tell what they'll do to
[1:11:17] them they'll probably mutilate them
[1:11:19] and then all of a sudden they take a
[1:11:22] body change on camera
[1:11:26] on camera because the Bible says the
[1:11:29] whole world will see them right that's
[1:11:31] right and they that dwell upon the Earth
[1:11:33] will rejoice
[1:11:34] and make Mary and send gifts one to the
[1:11:37] other because these two prophets
[1:11:38] tormented them to dwell on Earth and
[1:11:39] after three days
[1:11:41] and I have the spirit of life from God
[1:11:43] entered into them and they stood upon
[1:11:44] their feet and great fear fell upon them
[1:11:47] when saw them and they heard a great
[1:11:48] voice from Heaven saying unto them come
[1:11:50] up hither where'd you hear that at
[1:11:51] Revelations 4 1 said the same thing come
[1:11:54] up hither so they're going to take a
[1:11:56] Rapture just like we did in 4-1 they're
[1:11:57] going to take it here in
[1:12:00] between Revelations 6 1-19 come up
[1:12:03] hither and they ascended up to heaven in
[1:12:05] a cloud
[1:12:08] and their enemies beheld them
[1:12:10] so what did they do though while they
[1:12:13] were here
[1:12:15] the two prophets those two prophets
[1:12:17] besides striking plagues they preach
[1:12:20] Redemption that's right you missed it
[1:12:22] they walk into that Temple that they're
[1:12:25] sitting there making natural sacrifices
[1:12:26] and those 444 000 they're going to say
[1:12:29] look guys
[1:12:31] you
[1:12:32] they're wrong it's gone in my heart
[1:12:36] it's not God in that lamb it's God that
[1:12:39] Lamb's blood only covers we come to tell
[1:12:41] you that a man came to take care of all
[1:12:43] you said amen a human Immortal man God
[1:12:47] in human flesh
[1:12:49] came to do this all right let's go to
[1:12:51] quote number nine because remember they
[1:12:53] only prophesy
[1:12:56] now in the first seal I want you to
[1:12:58] realize look
[1:13:00] this is where everybody gets it
[1:13:02] wrong they're wrong
[1:13:05] there's only three and a half years left
[1:13:07] of the Messiah Doctrine to the Jews
[1:13:11] son of man Ministry preached three and a
[1:13:13] half here he's got to preach three and a
[1:13:15] half more to redeem Israel that's right
[1:13:18] only all right
[1:13:20] but where they're missing it at they're
[1:13:22] taking and saying well that's all that's
[1:13:23] left after the Rapture of the church to
[1:13:25] finish the 70 weeks it's not right
[1:13:28] Bible doesn't say that Prophet doesn't
[1:13:31] say that
[1:13:32] so whatever man word be a lie
[1:13:35] then they're still three and a half
[1:13:37] years waited for the Messiah Doctrine to
[1:13:40] the Jews see they go to the seal book
[1:13:42] that's what they do they say well
[1:13:44] brother Brown's Revelation progressed in
[1:13:47] the seal so he he he he he preached it
[1:13:50] wrong that's what they're saying in
[1:13:52] Daniel 70 weeks he preached it wrong
[1:13:54] but now in the seals he's he's making it
[1:13:57] all right
[1:13:59] well you know anytime brother Branham
[1:14:01] was wrong he told us he was wrong
[1:14:04] he said I was going to make a horrible
[1:14:06] mistake if the Holy Spirit hadn't come
[1:14:07] into the room and corrected me
[1:14:11] amen and remember he used to preach that
[1:14:13] the Holy Ghost was just love just love
[1:14:15] he said but the Holy Ghost corrected me
[1:14:19] now there's no word where he come back
[1:14:21] and said Daniel 70 which is wrong throw
[1:14:24] the chart away throw the three messages
[1:14:26] I preached away because this is right
[1:14:28] now
[1:14:28] no they just don't have a revelation of
[1:14:30] what's going on
[1:14:32] because there is just three and a half
[1:14:33] of them
[1:14:35] Messiah Ministry left after the Rapture
[1:14:37] that's the Bible
[1:14:39] but there's one week left to get the
[1:14:41] Jews redeemed the 144 000 and the City
[1:14:45] get the Earth cleaned off get everything
[1:14:47] ready for the Millennium all right
[1:14:49] then they're still three and a half
[1:14:51] years waited for the Messiah Doctrine to
[1:14:54] the Jew and God does not deal with the
[1:14:57] Jew and the Gentile at the same time he
[1:14:58] deals with Israel as a nation Gentile I
[1:15:01] mean Israel is a nation Gentile as an
[1:15:03] individual all right let's go next one
[1:15:07] watch these two prophets gonna do when
[1:15:09] they come this Beast this Prince that
[1:15:11] shall scatter the power of the Holy
[1:15:12] people what will he do your break is
[1:15:15] Covenant with them after three and a
[1:15:17] half years he'll ounce them now people
[1:15:20] think that's communism that's just
[1:15:21] because you have the spirit of God
[1:15:23] hasn't dealt with you yet it's not
[1:15:25] communism what's that been preaching on
[1:15:28] it's religion right it's religious
[1:15:32] Devils is going to kill this place now
[1:15:35] these two prophets what will they do
[1:15:39] guys I think y'all quote number nine is
[1:15:42] supposed to be a whole lot longer than
[1:15:43] that
[1:15:48] because I got the first seal with about
[1:15:49] three or four quotes on here and you've
[1:15:51] only got one but that's okay
[1:15:53] but in the first sale if you'll read it
[1:15:55] reads start pull the number nine back up
[1:15:59] coach number nine had about three or
[1:16:00] four
[1:16:02] times where he said it but read the
[1:16:05] first seal and you'll see where he's
[1:16:06] talking about the Messiah
[1:16:08] message or the Messiah Doctrine to the
[1:16:11] Jew
[1:16:11] he's not talking about that for a week
[1:16:13] that's left to redeem the people and the
[1:16:15] city he's talking about the people he's
[1:16:17] bringing Redemption down to 70 weeks in
[1:16:20] seven years or 70 weeks that's seven
[1:16:21] years
[1:16:22] and see that's what gets me about the
[1:16:25] people they don't go back and study
[1:16:27] because now I have because we got we got
[1:16:29] another Minister's meeting
[1:16:31] see they're saying well he he was he was
[1:16:33] wrong in Daniel 70 weeks but he
[1:16:35] progressed in Revelation in 19 from 61
[1:16:39] to 63 he progressed in Revelation so now
[1:16:42] he's teaching it there's only three and
[1:16:43] a half years left after the Rapture
[1:16:44] period Well I just happened to went back
[1:16:47] in 53 56 57 58 and 59. brother Brown was
[1:16:52] talking about one week of redemption
[1:16:57] three and a half here did Jesus preach
[1:16:59] and three and a half left to redeem
[1:17:01] Israel that's right I heard 144 000. so
[1:17:04] so so now brother Brown was really
[1:17:06] confused because he preached it this way
[1:17:09] then he comes back and preaches it this
[1:17:10] way in Daniel 70 weeks and he turns
[1:17:12] right back around and preached it the
[1:17:13] same way again that he did back over
[1:17:14] here
[1:17:15] I don't know what I'm saying people my
[1:17:17] profit's not that confused right if he
[1:17:20] is 25 1 is straight I'm telling you we
[1:17:23] need to find one that's straight
[1:17:24] if he's that confused I don't believe he
[1:17:26] is I just believe we don't understand
[1:17:27] what he's talking about amen but I
[1:17:30] believe that somebody has been breaking
[1:17:32] it down for years
[1:17:35] for years
[1:17:38] well there's the rest of it but that's
[1:17:40] okay we got we don't have time now we'll
[1:17:41] just read it on
[1:17:44] because I it comes and it talks about
[1:17:46] the 70 weeks to determined but he talks
[1:17:48] about that Messiah Doctrine and then he
[1:17:50] talks about the Messiah
[1:17:52] he doesn't say Messiah Ministry but it
[1:17:54] really is it's the ministry of the
[1:17:56] Messiah it's the Messiah Doctrine is
[1:17:58] what he says the doctrine of the Messiah
[1:17:59] that's right right it was him preaching
[1:18:02] itself yes the Holy Ghost preaching it
[1:18:04] now and it's going to be the Holy Ghost
[1:18:05] due to prophets preaching it to the 144
[1:18:08] 000. same God
[1:18:10] my man
[1:18:13] I don't know people
[1:18:15] you thank God
[1:18:17] you just thank God
[1:18:19] that somebody has broke this thing down
[1:18:22] so that even a child can understand it
[1:18:27] we got sisters in this church can
[1:18:28] explain it better than a lot of
[1:18:30] preachers in the message
[1:18:32] and I said
[1:18:33] do you want to make out a dish on the
[1:18:35] preacher the message you go right ahead
[1:18:36] but I'm going to tell you something
[1:18:38] it's time that we stop preaching about
[1:18:40] sea spot running
[1:18:42] right
[1:18:44] CJ running
[1:18:46] everybody understand I know a lot of you
[1:18:48] younger ones are going what is he
[1:18:50] talking about
[1:18:52] Freda knows what I'm talking about
[1:18:53] because we're the same age
[1:18:55] that's a first grade reader book the
[1:18:57] first grade reader you get when you open
[1:18:59] it says c-spot run
[1:19:01] spot run up the hill see Mary see Mary
[1:19:05] run see Mary walk and what was the other
[1:19:08] guys what was the guy's name dick James
[1:19:10] Sally dick James Sally dick brother Nick
[1:19:12] Jane and Sally and spot
[1:19:17] well now for those of you on the
[1:19:19] internet that was the first grade reader
[1:19:21] that's the point I'm trying to make we
[1:19:22] got to get out in first grade readers
[1:19:24] right See Spot Run will get you in the
[1:19:27] body of Christ maybe a c-spot run won't
[1:19:29] take you in a body change and get you
[1:19:32] out of here all right now look
[1:19:35] here we go now here we go now this is
[1:19:37] what it's supposed to be here's my
[1:19:39] paragraph 225 and 233 now this come this
[1:19:42] is the continuation of the first seal
[1:19:43] let's go back to it now see brother
[1:19:45] Brown was in the first seal he's not
[1:19:47] changed his Doctrine he's telling you
[1:19:49] about Redemption right right
[1:19:52] now just 70 weeks was determined
[1:19:54] perfectly as Daniel said that Messiah
[1:19:56] would come and would be cut off in the
[1:19:57] midst of the week
[1:19:58] now let's stop for just a second
[1:20:02] because the Bible doesn't say that
[1:20:08] the Bible doesn't say that the Messiah
[1:20:10] was cut off in the midst of the week
[1:20:11] that's right find it in the Bible
[1:20:12] there's nowhere but brother Branham
[1:20:15] reading between the lines reading the
[1:20:17] Love Letter you're showing us and that's
[1:20:19] exactly
[1:20:20] exactly in the middle of
[1:20:22] middle of side doctrine that he's
[1:20:24] preaching that seven years
[1:20:26] he's taking all that 70 weeks of Daniel
[1:20:28] and putting it in seven years three and
[1:20:29] a half that he physically preached on
[1:20:31] the earth and three and a half that he's
[1:20:32] preaching through two prophets right
[1:20:34] right that's what he's breaking it down
[1:20:36] to that's why everybody goes crazy
[1:20:38] because it says in Jesus prophesied
[1:20:40] three and a half years now in the middle
[1:20:41] of this three and a half years of Daniel
[1:20:42] in the middle of it he was cut off
[1:20:45] that's true
[1:20:47] 70 weeks is seven years when you look at
[1:20:50] Redemption it's three and a half over
[1:20:52] here and three and a half over here
[1:20:55] everybody got that okay now the middle
[1:20:57] of this tree years of Daniel in the
[1:20:59] middle of it he was cut off and now the
[1:21:01] last part is a tribulation period
[1:21:04] during the 1260 days that he's going to
[1:21:07] preach his last Messiah Doctrine to the
[1:21:09] Jews there's going to be a tribulation
[1:21:11] period all right where the Gentile
[1:21:13] church is oh this is great oh now don't
[1:21:15] the bride goes in with the ground then
[1:21:17] after the Millennium walks out upon the
[1:21:19] ashes of the wicked now we know this
[1:21:21] Roman Calendar back to paragraph 233 now
[1:21:24] we know this Roman Calendar has we got
[1:21:26] 28 days and sometimes 30 31. but
[1:21:29] actually the calendar reads this 30 days
[1:21:32] to every month that's right take a
[1:21:34] hundred a thousand two hundred and three
[1:21:35] score days and put 30 to it and see what
[1:21:37] you got three and a half years exactly
[1:21:39] to the dot that's the time that's
[1:21:43] allotted time for the Messiah message
[1:21:47] right
[1:21:48] to be preached to Israel like it was
[1:21:52] back there now I didn't have this quote
[1:21:54] I didn't find it just the other day
[1:21:56] this one's going with me to the minister
[1:21:58] to me
[1:22:00] coach look
[1:22:01] if that's the time what the 1260 days
[1:22:05] that's the time that's allotted time for
[1:22:09] the Messiah message
[1:22:12] to be preached to Israel like it was
[1:22:16] back there back where when he was here
[1:22:19] on the Earth right so there's your three
[1:22:21] and a half hair three and a half hair
[1:22:23] all right when he returns back and makes
[1:22:26] himself known in a symbol
[1:22:28] back when he comes he's talking about
[1:22:29] the sales all right let's go now back to
[1:22:31] him
[1:22:32] to number 10. this is back into the 70th
[1:22:35] week what these two prophets are going
[1:22:37] to do when they come this Beast of
[1:22:39] Prince shall scatter the power of the
[1:22:40] Holy people what will he do he'll break
[1:22:42] his Covenant with him after three and a
[1:22:44] half years he'll ask them now people
[1:22:46] thinks that's communism that's just
[1:22:47] because you're the spirit of God hasn't
[1:22:49] dealt with you yet it's not communism
[1:22:50] it's religion now these two prophets
[1:22:53] what will they do it's Moses and Elijah
[1:22:55] they'll rise on the scene they'll tell
[1:22:59] those Jews their mistake in other words
[1:23:01] the two prophets are going to rise out
[1:23:02] from among that group that's built the
[1:23:05] temple and doing their Temple worship
[1:23:07] and killing the animals and they think
[1:23:09] they got to do that before the Messiah
[1:23:10] comes because remember they don't think
[1:23:12] the messiah's got here yet right they
[1:23:15] don't think he's here so they're trying
[1:23:17] to get him here by making sacrifices
[1:23:19] just like the Old Testament did all
[1:23:21] right that's why that you if you'll
[1:23:23] study the five cups of Elijah they set a
[1:23:27] cup down
[1:23:28] for Elijah
[1:23:30] when they do when they have their
[1:23:32] ceremony over in in Israel they walk out
[1:23:35] the door and they look down the street
[1:23:37] and if Elijah's not coming they shut the
[1:23:40] door and they say until next year
[1:23:44] come see Elijah's got to come on the
[1:23:46] scene before the Messiah can come
[1:23:49] because they interpret That Old
[1:23:50] Testament as Elijah coming before the
[1:23:53] great and terrible day of the Lord
[1:23:55] but see what about those two prophets
[1:23:57] say hey guys look y'all missed it
[1:24:01] this is the fifth coming of Elijah right
[1:24:03] here
[1:24:04] standing in front of you that's what the
[1:24:06] two prophets are going to say
[1:24:08] you missed number four
[1:24:10] he got a gentile to go on a gentile
[1:24:13] Church to go on a rapture
[1:24:15] the spirit of Elijah
[1:24:16] I'm sorry they'll tell those Jews their
[1:24:18] mistake and
[1:24:20] Jewish Bunch that's there right now to
[1:24:22] be the 144 000 God will call these
[1:24:25] prophets what is it the spirit of Elijah
[1:24:28] off of this Gentile church will just
[1:24:30] continue right on into that Jewish
[1:24:32] Church go right on in and call Moses
[1:24:34] with him Hallelujah you see it
[1:24:37] and he'll preach the same message of
[1:24:39] Pentecost to those Jews that they
[1:24:42] rejected a messiah man you see it it
[1:24:44] would be the same Pentecostal message
[1:24:45] that these Jews will preach right over
[1:24:48] to them
[1:24:49] and they'll hate those Jews so bad till
[1:24:52] they'll kill them right
[1:24:53] right why because they'll be contrary to
[1:24:56] all that they've been trying to do since
[1:24:58] Christ left
[1:24:59] all right man is established Bliss
[1:25:02] Temple worship they've tried they built
[1:25:03] the thing and it's been torn down built
[1:25:05] that door down finally now they got the
[1:25:06] temple
[1:25:07] and they got then they're going to have
[1:25:09] two prophets and 144 000 going to go in
[1:25:12] there every day and do just like Jesus
[1:25:13] did they hated him in that Temple
[1:25:17] that's why they said we'd be not born in
[1:25:18] fornication like you are going to defame
[1:25:20] would have proved that he was born in
[1:25:21] fornication he couldn't enter it in the
[1:25:23] temple that's right because remember if
[1:25:25] you're a bastard child you couldn't
[1:25:27] enter into four generations right or for
[1:25:29] uh or whatever ten Generations 400 years
[1:25:32] see if they could do that and prove he
[1:25:34] was a bastard child he would but they
[1:25:35] hated him in that Temple but every time
[1:25:37] there was a feast Jesus was standing in
[1:25:39] that Temple because why he was at
[1:25:41] Paschal Lamb he was the lamb that should
[1:25:43] have been slain
[1:25:45] besides the one that was on the altar
[1:25:46] that was being slain so they're going to
[1:25:48] walk in just like Jesus did they're
[1:25:50] going to walk in and say hey
[1:25:51] stop it
[1:25:53] the massage already come and we've come
[1:25:56] to tell you that he's not dead but he's
[1:25:59] alive and here he is right here
[1:26:03] he seem to be the same thing caused the
[1:26:06] message that Jesus Jews will preach
[1:26:07] right over to them and they'll hate
[1:26:09] those Jews so bad so they'll kill them
[1:26:11] and they were hated by All Nations and
[1:26:13] in the midst of the week
[1:26:15] well after he breaks that Covenant after
[1:26:17] three and a half years after they get
[1:26:19] finished preaching their message all
[1:26:21] right
[1:26:22] and in the midst of the week because
[1:26:23] they raised up a great powerful 144 000.
[1:26:26] I don't think it's just the two prophets
[1:26:28] it's going to be doing the work that's
[1:26:29] right
[1:26:30] it's going to be a great powerful 144
[1:26:34] 000 right they had the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:36] brother you talk about doing Miracles
[1:26:38] they did them they stopped Heaven they
[1:26:40] didn't rain in the days of Prophecy
[1:26:41] smoked the Earth with plagues as often
[1:26:43] as they wanted they give plagues and
[1:26:45] everything else they'll give them Romans
[1:26:47] a hard way to go
[1:26:49] finally they'll be killed because that's
[1:26:52] what the scripture says
[1:26:55] our God is a terrible God when he's
[1:26:57] angry but remember that's what we're in
[1:26:59] the 70th week
[1:27:01] and the church in glory so we're gone
[1:27:03] we're not getting a part of this amen
[1:27:06] the wedding supper's going on yes now
[1:27:09] notice that's where we've seen her
[1:27:11] coming back to the millennial Temple
[1:27:12] over here at the end of the Jewish age
[1:27:17] not at the end of the 1260. that's the
[1:27:19] Messiah message
[1:27:21] right
[1:27:23] it's a chance
[1:27:27] at the end of the Jewish age the
[1:27:29] anointed here he comes riding on a white
[1:27:32] horse those following him a lot of
[1:27:34] horses horses Powers dressed in white
[1:27:36] blood of extra drifting blood wrote on
[1:27:38] him the word of God he cometh the mighty
[1:27:40] conqueror to save the millennium coming
[1:27:42] to the temple Glory there he meets that
[1:27:45] 144 000 where in the temple right
[1:27:48] they're already building it down here we
[1:27:50] come riding in to anoint it well that's
[1:27:52] the last one that's number six
[1:27:55] to anoint the most holy all right so now
[1:27:58] let's go back to Daniel 9 24 and real
[1:28:00] quick we're going to go through the
[1:28:02] first three and then that's where we'll
[1:28:04] start next Sunday is we'll start with
[1:28:07] the sixth full purpose but I wanted you
[1:28:08] to come to
[1:28:09] to um to see the first three and just
[1:28:12] kind of keeping your mind until we get
[1:28:14] there Daniel 9 24 said 70 weeks are
[1:28:16] determined upon thy people and upon thy
[1:28:19] Holy City to do those six things to
[1:28:21] finish the transgression to make an end
[1:28:23] of sins to make reconciliation for
[1:28:25] iniquity to bring an everlasting
[1:28:27] righteousness to seal up Division and
[1:28:28] prophecy and anoint the most
[1:28:31] holy
[1:28:32] so now number one
[1:28:35] is finished the transgression what does
[1:28:38] transgression mean to violate a command
[1:28:41] or a law
[1:28:43] when the Israel transgressed
[1:28:47] they broke the law right
[1:28:50] that's their transgression
[1:28:52] but God has come to finish the
[1:28:55] transgression
[1:28:57] not continuous stop it finish it
[1:29:00] eradicate it he did it at Calvary but
[1:29:05] They didn't accept the pardon that we
[1:29:07] accepted now they're accepting the
[1:29:10] pardon through two Prophets The Two
[1:29:12] prophets are preaching this to them
[1:29:15] they're gonna their transgression is
[1:29:17] going to be finished through those two
[1:29:18] prophets and it being revealed to them
[1:29:20] and then like I said it's going to be a
[1:29:23] type of justification
[1:29:24] because to be justified
[1:29:27] is that remember what I said when you
[1:29:29] become a Christian what's the first
[1:29:30] thing you do you become a lawyer
[1:29:33] do's and don'ts do's and don'ts when you
[1:29:36] become Justified it's do's and don'ts
[1:29:37] because you're growing up as a Christian
[1:29:39] all right your past sins are what
[1:29:42] finished
[1:29:43] is that not justification we're going to
[1:29:46] get into this next Sunday because you're
[1:29:48] going to have to see the seals and and
[1:29:50] the Redemption of the people here before
[1:29:52] we can see it over there but he's going
[1:29:55] to do three things right now finish the
[1:29:57] transgression transgression means to
[1:29:58] violate the commander of law but on the
[1:30:01] flip side it means justification
[1:30:04] because it finishes your transgression
[1:30:07] it finishes what you've done in the past
[1:30:11] because what to pass was under the law
[1:30:13] and that's what killed you right
[1:30:14] those are drawn to the law
[1:30:16] or dead
[1:30:17] all right you can't live the law
[1:30:19] but they finished it he's going to
[1:30:21] finish Israel's transgression all right
[1:30:23] let's go to court number 11.
[1:30:26] six full purpose now if we back up into
[1:30:29] Daniel again we'll find out that then
[1:30:31] when we find out here the 24th first all
[1:30:32] right to finish the transgression
[1:30:34] you finish what to finish Israel's
[1:30:36] transgression
[1:30:39] so it wasn't finished at Calvary now
[1:30:42] he's come when the Jews I mean when the
[1:30:44] the Gentiles are gone he's come down
[1:30:46] through two prophets for 1260 days
[1:30:48] they're going to do this they're going
[1:30:50] to preach
[1:30:51] and Israel that 144 000 is going to see
[1:30:54] that they transgress right
[1:30:57] okay to finish the transgression to
[1:31:00] finish what to finish Israel's
[1:31:02] transgression what is transgressives to
[1:31:04] go against something a transgress
[1:31:06] against me is to do it wrong to me
[1:31:08] transgress against you do it wrong to
[1:31:10] you so Israel did a wrong to God and in
[1:31:13] this 70th week what's going to happen
[1:31:16] God is going to finish the transgression
[1:31:19] of Israel finish the transgression will
[1:31:21] be turning away the ungodliness from
[1:31:24] Jacob and that all Israel will be born
[1:31:27] again all of them will receive the Holy
[1:31:29] Ghost that's coming on down now let's go
[1:31:31] to the next one number two is to make a
[1:31:34] what end of sin
[1:31:36] what he's saying
[1:31:38] I believe
[1:31:40] what can wash away my sin nothing but
[1:31:45] the
[1:31:47] what does blood do
[1:31:49] sanctifies you right
[1:31:51] blood is the only sanctifier
[1:31:54] like him wash away my sin nothing but
[1:31:58] the blood of Jesus
[1:32:00] that's what's going to happen to them
[1:32:02] they're going to make an end of sins
[1:32:05] is that supposed to be plural and I
[1:32:07] think I wrote saying I got sins down
[1:32:09] make sure you it's the end of sins it's
[1:32:11] their sins are going to end
[1:32:13] all right now number three all right
[1:32:15] let's go to quote number 12. let's see
[1:32:18] what he said about end of sin where did
[1:32:20] they make their sin now listen let's
[1:32:21] turn to Matthew 24 here's what Israel
[1:32:23] made their fatal mistake
[1:32:25] here's where she done her last sin and
[1:32:27] the reason that she's in the condition
[1:32:28] today
[1:32:29] without you without reading all that you
[1:32:32] know what that is right they let
[1:32:34] Barabbas go and pilate said what shall I
[1:32:36] do which
[1:32:37] with this Jesus called Christ they all
[1:32:39] said unto him let him be crucified now
[1:32:40] remember that's their Messiah that
[1:32:42] Daniel said would come
[1:32:45] 70 weeks are determined and my size cut
[1:32:47] off after 62 weeks all right you
[1:32:49] remember this morning in the lesson here
[1:32:51] he'll be cut off not for himself not
[1:32:53] nothing he did and that's exactly
[1:32:55] correct he did it for what US let him be
[1:32:58] crucified
[1:33:00] scrolling up
[1:33:02] right here he go down just one more
[1:33:05] here's their mistake here is their sin
[1:33:08] then they answered then answered the
[1:33:09] people and said his blood be on us and
[1:33:12] on our children that's right
[1:33:15] and that's exactly what carried it over
[1:33:17] right but God's going to make an end to
[1:33:19] that you know what he's going to forget
[1:33:20] it
[1:33:22] he's going to forget it but if you ever
[1:33:25] remembered it you've got to bring it
[1:33:26] back up he's going to forget it there's
[1:33:28] where they done it he was making an end
[1:33:30] of sin for them how could he do anything
[1:33:32] else but forgive them knowing that he
[1:33:33] had to Blind their eyes that we could
[1:33:35] come in it's like his own children
[1:33:37] calling for his blood and they were
[1:33:39] blinded and he know they were blinded
[1:33:41] that's the reason he cried for
[1:33:42] forgiveness for them forgive them Father
[1:33:43] for they don't know what they're doing
[1:33:45] they were blind
[1:33:46] for our sake they were made blind that's
[1:33:49] what God's going to give them
[1:33:51] this restoration because he blinded them
[1:33:54] for me and you all right
[1:33:57] but when they see him again in their
[1:33:59] unbelief they did this because remember
[1:34:02] what they didn't believe he was a
[1:34:04] messiah there's their unbelief there's
[1:34:06] their sin but when you come back around
[1:34:09] and those two prophets preach that
[1:34:11] that's who that was that's going to end
[1:34:13] their sins
[1:34:15] put an end to sin what is sin unbelief
[1:34:17] they did not believe that was a messiah
[1:34:19] they could not see him to be the Messiah
[1:34:21] yet he done every sign the Messiah was
[1:34:23] supposed to do but they could not see it
[1:34:26] they were blind now in student number
[1:34:28] three and then we'll stop right there
[1:34:30] make reconciliation for iniquity
[1:34:34] all right reconciliation
[1:34:37] means to restore Fellowship
[1:34:40] if if a husband and wife separates
[1:34:45] and they reconcile what they do they
[1:34:47] come back into Fellowship just as they
[1:34:49] were before
[1:34:53] what does the Holy Ghost do
[1:34:55] it restores our fellowship
[1:34:58] it brings us into God right brings us
[1:35:00] close friends it reconciled us back
[1:35:02] remember what it's a message of
[1:35:04] reconciliation to bring us back to
[1:35:06] Christ that's what Paul said in
[1:35:07] Corinthians make reconciliation though
[1:35:09] for their iniquity and iniquity is a
[1:35:12] hideous sin but it's they he makes
[1:35:14] reconciliation for their iniquity he
[1:35:17] restores Fellowship back to them
[1:35:20] all right so that's one two and three
[1:35:22] you got justification sanctification and
[1:35:24] baptism in the Holy Ghost just like you
[1:35:26] and I so they have to go through the
[1:35:27] same Journey just like we did right all
[1:35:30] right they get the same Ministry that
[1:35:32] you and I get not different the same one
[1:35:34] right all right but now look
[1:35:37] now look it's the same as our Redemption
[1:35:40] what is it what does the Holy Ghost do
[1:35:42] the Holy Ghost finishes ends and
[1:35:45] reconciles
[1:35:47] because remember if they said this part
[1:35:49] of you that's still alive
[1:35:51] you don't have all together
[1:35:56] but when you say finish and you say in
[1:35:59] and you say reconcile
[1:36:02] finishes your transgression
[1:36:05] and your sin and makes reconciliation
[1:36:08] for iniquity iniquity is knowing to do
[1:36:10] better
[1:36:11] and not doing it it's a hideous sin is
[1:36:15] what um I looked it up in the in the
[1:36:17] Webster dictionary but iniquity is a
[1:36:20] hideous sin that means you shouldn't do
[1:36:23] it and you do it anyway well that's what
[1:36:24] we do
[1:36:25] but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[1:36:27] our soul God has reconciled us back to
[1:36:30] Christ amen same way with the Jews
[1:36:32] they're not unredeemable they're as
[1:36:34] redeemable as we are
[1:36:36] that's right all right but God doesn't
[1:36:38] do it any different I want you to see
[1:36:40] these first three and then we'll stop
[1:36:41] right here and then we'll start we'll
[1:36:43] read
[1:36:44] um read Isaiah 53. Isaiah 53 is totally
[1:36:48] the six-fold purpose right
[1:36:50] totally what Christ comes to do
[1:36:53] because see they know what's going to
[1:36:55] happen they just don't know when it's
[1:36:56] going to happen
[1:36:57] to them but when the two prophets get
[1:37:00] there they're going to say it's already
[1:37:01] happened
[1:37:03] he's already finished all your
[1:37:04] transgression he's already finished your
[1:37:06] sin it's already reconciled your
[1:37:08] iniquity that's like brother Dale said
[1:37:10] if we
[1:37:13] what we're doing here that's what the
[1:37:15] prophet said realize who we are and what
[1:37:17] we're doing here we'll be a powerful
[1:37:19] Army didn't I just read you a quote that
[1:37:21] said when 144 000 received the Holy
[1:37:24] Ghost
[1:37:24] there'll be a powerful Army
[1:37:27] they'll take those Romans and they'll do
[1:37:29] things to those Romans that live
[1:37:31] you know we don't do
[1:37:33] but I've always said don't make a Jew
[1:37:35] mad
[1:37:37] holy ghost or no Holy Ghost don't make a
[1:37:39] Jew man all right and that's what you're
[1:37:41] doing dude you make them guys mad
[1:37:43] they're going to kill at least 144 000
[1:37:46] they're going to kill him through
[1:37:47] profits they're going to see though
[1:37:50] if you read Zechariah 12 and Zechariah
[1:37:53] 13 we'll read that starting Sunday
[1:37:57] and you'll see the Redemption of Israel
[1:37:59] but all this takes place Gojo can you
[1:38:02] put that chart up
[1:38:07] musicians come on
[1:38:11] the chart of the last week
[1:38:15] all right this is this is the Gentile
[1:38:18] Church goes into Glory right
[1:38:20] part of the this is part of the uh thing
[1:38:23] that we did a couple weeks ago right
[1:38:26] here's where two prophets preach what we
[1:38:28] just talked about they're gonna make an
[1:38:30] end of sand reconciliation for iniquity
[1:38:32] and finish your transgression right here
[1:38:34] now look
[1:38:37] if you do like most people in the
[1:38:39] message
[1:38:39] the 70 weeks of Daniel ends right here
[1:38:42] I've seen the charts and I've seen
[1:38:43] people talk about it and preach it I'll
[1:38:45] preach it but talk about it if that
[1:38:47] finishes everything but what are you
[1:38:49] gonna do about these three guys right
[1:38:50] here
[1:38:51] because you can't see one two and three
[1:38:55] is what we just read a few minutes ago
[1:38:58] dinner's got to be about
[1:39:00] those after 1200
[1:39:04] they leave
[1:39:05] right
[1:39:07] after 1260 days they go in in the glory
[1:39:10] they take a rapture
[1:39:12] well how you gonna bring an everlasting
[1:39:13] righteousness over here
[1:39:16] How You Gonna seal up the business and
[1:39:18] prophecy over here
[1:39:19] and how are you going to anoint the most
[1:39:21] holy which is us riding back in the
[1:39:22] Millennium Temple
[1:39:26] can't happen in 1260 days
[1:39:28] there's got to be one week left just
[1:39:31] what the prophet said there's one week
[1:39:32] left after the Rapture
[1:39:35] one two and three to to take a group of
[1:39:39] people home
[1:39:40] four five and six to restore battle
[1:39:43] alarm again we'll start on that next
[1:39:44] Sunday and I'm going to show you where
[1:39:46] it purified the Earth is being purified
[1:39:47] during this time because Everlasting
[1:39:49] righteousness brother Brown said the the
[1:39:52] world is going to be just like the
[1:39:54] Garden of Eden everything's going to
[1:39:56] start just growing back again
[1:39:58] it's not like a future home
[1:40:01] future home is going to be the city's
[1:40:02] coming right down and we're going to
[1:40:04] walk into it the Millennium is just
[1:40:06] going to be a progression because and
[1:40:09] this is one thing I don't understand
[1:40:10] brother Ryan said to be a gospel priest
[1:40:12] of the Heathen where's the Heathen
[1:40:13] coming from I don't know but somebody's
[1:40:16] got to live a thousand years to prove
[1:40:18] the sin curse is over remember God told
[1:40:19] them said the day you eat thereof that
[1:40:21] day you die a thousand years is a day
[1:40:22] and days a thousand years that's why
[1:40:24] it's called a millennium that's one
[1:40:25] thousand years
[1:40:26] well that's not for me and you
[1:40:29] we're eternal
[1:40:31] somebody's got to live a thousand years
[1:40:33] to prove the sin curse is over I don't
[1:40:34] know who's going to live that thousand
[1:40:36] years that's why I said it doesn't
[1:40:37] matter to me
[1:40:40] that part doesn't because they asked
[1:40:42] brother Reynold he said I don't know
[1:40:45] I don't know whether this will happen
[1:40:46] but this will happen
[1:40:47] but I know one thing for sure if you
[1:40:49] don't have the Holy Ghost you're not
[1:40:50] going to know what's not going to happen
[1:40:51] because you won't be there that's right
[1:40:53] but if you got the Holy Ghost you got a
[1:40:54] free ride right right over the top of
[1:40:57] all this and seeing Revelations 19 we
[1:40:59] come riding back in the millennium
[1:41:02] right
[1:41:04] to anoint the temple so the Temple's got
[1:41:06] to be built right in here somewhere to
[1:41:08] finish because 70 weeks are determined
[1:41:10] to do six things
[1:41:13] three of them's already been done
[1:41:17] by what we were just preaching not
[1:41:18] naturally but when we go home three of
[1:41:21] them's got to be done and they take a
[1:41:22] Rapture and the other three is going to
[1:41:24] have to finish
[1:41:25] the holy city
[1:41:29] so that you and I can come right down
[1:41:31] into it riding in Revelations 19 we'll
[1:41:34] read it next Sunday we'll ride into the
[1:41:35] millennium
[1:41:37] with Jesus Christ
[1:41:39] I just read it to meet the 144 000.
[1:41:43] they come right back down here and start
[1:41:45] building that Temple
[1:41:47] that starts the Everlasting
[1:41:48] righteousness
[1:41:50] then they're they're anointed then
[1:41:53] anoint the most holy is not to them it's
[1:41:55] us that part is to us but we're the
[1:41:58] anointing to the temple the temple has
[1:41:59] to be built and then we come in
[1:42:01] and we anoint that temple with what
[1:42:04] the Holy Ghost do we have
[1:42:06] that's the anointing that's what
[1:42:08] happened in the Old Testament they just
[1:42:10] didn't call it the baptism of the Holy
[1:42:12] Ghost because it hadn't entered into a
[1:42:13] group of people but that's what that
[1:42:16] anointing was in the temple it was God
[1:42:18] in the form of a spirit
[1:42:20] the Holy Spirit
[1:42:22] come down in that Temple
[1:42:25] right amen come down in the wilderness
[1:42:28] that was the light
[1:42:30] that that one priest could meet
[1:42:33] once a year he met the Holy Ghost
[1:42:36] but that Holy Ghost that that anointing
[1:42:39] or that atonement of the blood of bulls
[1:42:41] and goats couldn't take the sin away
[1:42:43] from that man so that that could come
[1:42:46] into here
[1:42:47] and that's what they're still thinking
[1:42:49] over there now
[1:42:50] but you and I know
[1:42:52] that Temple's been done away with
[1:42:54] sacrificing offerings I would have not
[1:42:56] but a what a body he wants to live in
[1:42:58] this Temple this is the Temple of the
[1:43:00] Holy Ghost and then what Paul said this
[1:43:03] is the Temple of the Holy Ghost this is
[1:43:04] what we're going to walk into the
[1:43:05] Millennium and say look
[1:43:07] this is what God wanted to live in
[1:43:10] we built this Millennia you've built
[1:43:12] this Millennium Temple according to
[1:43:14] Ezekiel 40 to 44.
[1:43:16] but we're going to show you
[1:43:17] justification
[1:43:18] outer Court sanctification inner Court
[1:43:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:43:24] I believe holy
[1:43:26] same type we're not going to get away
[1:43:28] from our times
[1:43:29] we're not going to get away from the
[1:43:31] Plan of Redemption which is
[1:43:32] justification sanctification and to
[1:43:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost let us down
[1:43:39] number 369 the Ripple
[1:43:42] 369 in the red book we'll pick this back
[1:43:46] up right here next Sunday afternoon
[1:43:50] and finish up with a six-fold purpose
[1:43:54] of money God is Jesus
[1:44:19] is only
[1:44:28] here
[1:44:34] I got it
[1:44:50] did you see that
[1:44:58] it's important to know your
[1:45:06] friends

[1:46:59] foreign
[1:48:02] It's gotta come from us
[1:48:05] to be made it rattles
