want to see praise the Lord you love the Lord tonight amen are you happy to be in the house of God you think the the rain out there is wet enough my dad would always tell me he said hey go check outside save that waters wet enough but yeah we appreciate God for the rain because we need the rain because if we didn't have rain we want to be appreciate these sunny days right we appreciate so if you don't have bad times a man you're not gonna appreciate good times amen and we got to have a balance of both amen in order to grow in our lives praise God amen let's go ahead and we're gonna read the word and then I'll have you be seated amen if you want to turn to revelations chapter 1 Revelation chapter 1 I'm gonna start at verse 1 amen the Bible says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who bare record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth not just readeth and they that hear the words of his this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand verse 4 John to the seven churches where which are in Asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead amen and the Prince of the kings of the earth you know it's interesting that it calls him the Prince of the kings of the earth you might think a prince it might be lower than the king but it's actually the other way around the prince is actually higher than a king the position if you look at the at the definition of this of this of the way it's saying it here it means a ruler Kings here on earth only rule for a certain period time amen this is the ruler of heaven and earth praise God unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and verse 6 and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen praise God let's just borrow heads before we before we sit down our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the opportunity that we have to gather around your word Lord Lord the people have taken time father God too to come father and probably weary in body Lord Jesus through the rain Lord God through the dangerous roads Lord and I pray that you just not let him down Lord God and you Heavenly Father come in our mist father and speak to our hearts Lord everything that we need to receive father that we need to hear so that we may go grow closer father grow more in you Lord Lord bless father God brother Dale by the way by the dawn is there still traveling continue to watch over them on the roads keep them safe father and just bringing them back home safely and father's strengthen me Lord and help me father to just be say something that would help edify Lord and you be glorified Lord Jesus Lord we've given our time to study your word Lord now father God you do you read the rest Lord God I'm limited father as a man Lord Jesus but we know that we serve an unlimited god father in this hour we love you and we commit this time into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated tonight praise God amen before I get started I would just ask that you all remember us in prayer 30 days from now we're going to be leaving for Honduras and Nicaragua on December 14th so and I know I haven't mentioned that we haven't mentioned it much but so we're gonna be over there for about three almost three and a half weeks and they've we've got they've got a full schedule lined up for me down there including preaching at a pastors convention and and preaching at a youth camp two youth camps and and dedicating a church the church that we've been helping helping out and and among other things probably preaching in other churches as well so it's gonna be packed out so you remember us in prayer my wife and my two daughters they're gonna come with me and so we're just gonna we're just expecting the Lord do great things amen and I was just asking I would ask and maybe this is something that I would maybe mention to brother Dale but there is a church down in Nicaragua that is trying to finish building a built their church down there and I told them that I've mentioned it to the church you know if you all wanted to help in any way you know with the church that would certainly bless them you're certainly not required to but but I told them that I'd mention it but if not you know you remember them in your prayers amen I'd sure the the believers they're there they've been very good to me in that part of Nicaragua and so there's they're trying to get finish up the building that they're there in the city of Managua which is the capital of Nicaragua so you remember that in prayer and you know whenever you're in missions you're always in the will of the Lord amen it's what brother Branham said so we're just there want to be a blessing so you remember us in prayer in the next several weeks is where as we're planning and getting ready to head out amen mmm praise the Lord Amen so you love the Lord Amen sister June brother Josh the Anna is good to see you guys back he may have missed you all it's always always missing sister June smiling face I said brother Josh no I can't say you smile sometimes there you go praise the Lord Amen well tonight I want to speak this evening and we're gonna try not to take up too much of your time amen but I want to if I could give it this a title I want to call it the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto you I know the Bible says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him now you got to make the word personal amen the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto you amen because remember you are him amen he's you just as much if you got God dwelling in your soul amen there's God in but in the form of the Holy Spirit that's God's soul dwelling in you amen that makes you just as much God as he is amen and that's the thing that you and I have to confess in this hour it's so difficult for us so sure it was good yeah we can say it God was in in the disciples and we could say God was in the New Testament church God was in Paul's shirt God was in brother Branham but I don't know if God can be in me amen but the Bible wants you to confess that he is not only going to be with you but in you amen God's gonna have a voice in this hour amen God's gonna have a bride in this hour made up a multi-member bride amen that God is going to be manifesting in this day because remember God is supposed to be manifesting through all church ages and and we're still living in this age Amen I believe if you are born again amen baptizing in the Holy Spirit amen you're outside of the age your soul is right but we're still living here in Laodicea praise God and you are supposed to manifest God to this generation in this hour Amen God as I've said before God's gonna have a young person in the older person Amen a little kid Amen to manifest Jesus Christ in their day praise God I believe that without my heart amen and you you should be privileged and you should be honored and always wanted to give God that the praise they meant because he's chosen you in this hour to manifest the God of creation think about that Saints to manifest the God of creation who not just created the heavens and the earth created you and everything that you've made that you're made up of amen praise God and yet he wants to dwell in these little feeble vessels to reveal himself through us so that we can manifest him in this hour what a great privilege a man praise God amen so I'm gonna start reading with this quote amen with brother Branham end and if brothers the brothers could bring up quote number one amen praise the Lord welcome brother Branham says here he says in the revelation of Jesus Christ he says a notice it is also it also is the consummation of the scriptures the complete consummation speaking of speaking of of the of the scriptures the revelation and this let's get down to right here and when a man tries to take anything away from it or add anything to it God said he'd take the same part out of the book of life see he would take his part from the book if he added to it why is that because the revelation of Jesus Christ is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ that's the reason why you can't add nothing to it and you take nothing from it right because it's complete and if you try to add something to it then brother Bram said it's a false prophecy if you try to take something to it you're a thief amen and it's a fault you're false prophet as well therefore when we see the manifold revelation of our Lord who he is what he is if any person shall add something to that or take anything away from it it's a false prophecy many have tried to say they had something later than that but that is the complete revelation of the Lord Jesus in his church age in his day a revelation of our Lord amen praise the Lord amen and the next quote the brothers could bring it up early Brown says the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be overemphasized amen revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize because Saints you can listen to the Bible when I was in the Baptist Church I heard the word I heard Matthew 28:19 many times go ye into all the world baptized and name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost I read the scriptures I read all that word but if it's not rid of revelation to you amen then you don't know where you're standing you know when you know that something has come down and it's been revealed to you and you know for a fact nobody or no no movement no nothing no devil in Hell will ever shake that away from you that's the reason why when I came to the revelation when I came into this message in 1999 and and I heard the message and the first thing that that God that God revealed to me was one God and baptism name of Lord Jesus Christ and that sucked down to in me I mean I have understood anything else but that sunk down so deep in me that I I don't see how I can go back to what what I was used to believe there's just no way that's why I don't understand why these people that have been in the message 40 50 years and say and back in the nominal Church to get what it's did that means that their verbal ation they were the word was not revealed to them remember a revelation is a stone is a rock right let's just pretend it's bits there's a there's a big mountain in in in South Carolina or well there's a there's an area it's called Table Rock I don't know if you ever been to it or not there's a big rock there hanging off that mountain it's huge now it's gonna take our lot is gonna take a supernatural force to move that but there's nobody you can go over there and try to move Table Rock mm-hmm you know and have a bunch of people's trying to move it and it'll never budge because it's solid right and that's the same thing with a revelation when God reveals something from the Bible to you and you know for a fact God that is the truth there's nothing nobody no movement no nothing will shake that away from you amen and that's how it is with like the revelation with one God amen there's nobody can shake that away from you praise the Lord and Rosa well I see so revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I am NOT talking about this book of Revelation and you I am talking about all revelation it is tremendously important to the church so young people when when you hear the word would constantly say though the word revelation revelation revelation the Book of Revelations that's very important because without a revelation you don't know where you're standing without a revelation you're gonna be like a leaf will swayed to and fro one church says this then another church says this will I go to that then and then this church oh okay well I'll just go over here and then this church says that oh I'm just gonna go over here you know it's like that zombie message that I preached a couple of years ago you know you're like a zombie you know and then back and forth back and forth you see that that's how it is you're dead while you're living but when you have a true revelation of Jesus Christ you know where you're standing amen praise God you're alive because Christ is alive amen they scroll down to the bottom brothers and it says brother Brown says here the church is built on Revelation amen on the dust set the Lord praise God amen that's the reason why Jesus Christ Jesus said Jesus said on this rock I will build my church on who Jesus Christ this amen on the Son of God amen praise God and the gates of hell you see not even the gates of hell Satan himself cannot take that away from you when you truly when that revelation has sunk down deep into your heart amen why because he agrees with the word amen now if you go to number three brothers now this is what the this is what the the word revelation is is the word apocalypsis it sounds like in in Spanish it's apocalypsis so but that's the Greek and this is it means revelation be revealed to lighten manifestation are coming and appearing a laying bare making naked a disclosure of truth instruction concerning things before unknown you see used up events by which things are States or persons hitherto withdrawn from view are made visible to all manifestation and appearance amen so that's what a revelation is to you they meant you those that know about when Michelangelo made and brother Branham preached the message this message when Michelangelo made the statue of Moses you see and it had to add when he was complete when he was done sure maybe he had the thing covered for the critics to come through and see what this statue was all about and once that cover came off then the critics were able to see exactly what was under that that cover you see and that's what a revelation is when something's revealed to you then you can see it clearly it's not you're not guessing anymore you're not pondering whether it is this is that way or this that way no when it's revealed to you you see it clearly amen and guess what word Beals on top of that revelation more revelation on top of that revelation because even the critics probably looking at that statue of Michael of Moses they probably they got closer to it then and they started seeing oh my look at this the court look at this this knee right here and look at look at the ears look at that beard how its shaped you know getting all into the details and that's how it is when the true revelation of Christ is come into your life it's not gonna be just one revelation its revelation on top of Revelation on top of Revelation that's building the Sun in you amen the Son of God in you Jesus Christ praise the Lord amen all right so so even so even Jesus he had to grow in Revelation and you might like what Jesus himself had to grow in Revelation the Bible says that he had to grow in wisdom and in knowledge amen praise God even though he was born God he was born God right here on earth the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelleth in him he didn't know all things he still had to grow amen praise God some of you are looking a little bit low looking at me a little strange but I'll just let I'll just let brother branham tell you that in just a minute let's just read a few scriptures and and look what John 5:19 says then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself so Jesus couldn't just go and do whatever he wanted to but why he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise it's he only was able to do what the what God what the father revealed to him to do that's why he could do why because he was our example see he came in the flesh he was just as much God as he was human you see but he was our example amen because he also had some limit as a limit to him as well because we can't we should we can't act unless God reveals or it shows us what we need to do next you see praise God I like I like how brother Dale you know when he talks about how he would study this Daniel seventy weeks and and things like that and he said I would not preach Daniel seventy weeks or some doctrines that he couldn't fully understand until he fully understood him then you see until that came down and Rabindra it was revealed to him and I like that you see I like I think a minister should do that you know because you might cause more harm than you do good you see amen there's something you don't understand just leave it alone amen maybe calling somebody else that might be able to help you amen but just leave it alone and let God reveal that to you John 15:15 says henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord do it but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you amen so that was his that was his desire he wanted to make all things know unto them and speaking of speaking unto the disciples and he wanted us amen to he wanted all things to be made known unto them but he can only make known unto them what the father gave him Matthew 11:27 says all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the Sun but the father neither knoweth any man the father saved the Sun and he to whomsoever the Sun will reveal him amen praise God aren't you glad that you're part of that whomsoever at whomsoever capture lates all of us if you have the Holy Spirit in your life amen praise God amen so let me just let the Prophet tell you if it go to rob Ram says here he says now I said that this book of Revelation is the revelation of Jesus and what he is doing in the churches for those seven ages it is a revelation because the disciples themselves didn't know these recorded truths it had not been previously revealed to them you remember that they came to Jesus in the book of Acts and asked him are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel and he said it is not for you to know the times or the seasons those men were still thinking of Jesus having an earthly Kingdom but it was a spiritual Kingdom that he was going to build now look what brother Brown says here even he could not tell them about his place in it for the father had not revealed it unto him but now after his death and resurrection watch now after his death and resurrection and at this particular time in his Metis mediatorial ministry he is able to set forth here in this revelation of himself to John what his glory and presence in the church would mean and do praise God so Jesus himself did not do why because listen he had to fulfill he had to die and he had to resurrect he had to become the firstfruits of the Resurrection he had to become the firstfruits all this though the things that took place in his life so that you so that he could pass that down unto us Amen by via the Holy Spirit amen and then we be partakers of that same life you see that's the reason why we can partake Amen we can we are looking forward to a resurrection in this hour because he resurrected the resident the people the the Saints that have died before us are not going to raise if Jesus Christ have not raised see God had to do it first then we which are alive and remain then we in this hour can perform amen the same things in this hour but without him we can do nothing the Bible says you see I'm so thankful a man that he that he had to do it amen himself first so when Jesus died and raised amen he said after that he said that all power was given unto him both in heaven and in earth right isn't that what he said it was at that time that he said that before that he didn't say that even though he had God dwelling in him you think about that Saints the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelleth in him potentially Jesus Christ had all power in both in heaven and earth amen but it wasn't until the resurrection after he died and after he resurrected that he said all power is given unto me both in heaven and in earth amen praise God and you think about this Saints if Jesus Christ could do a man what he did with the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelleth in him amen and the things that you at this multi member brought a body amen can do in this hour with just the downpayment of God in their life in down in your soul they meant God wants you to believe his word and he wants to perform it through you amen even though you have a my new portion of God dwelling in you but the thing is is that that little minut portion has just as much God as Dez Dez Dez the whole thing you have to see it that way amen now we are waiting for a full manifestation because while we were waiting for the redemption of these bodies amen we're still waiting for the redemption of this body so so that little my new portion is gonna lead to that fullness with that full portion amen you just keep hanging on Saints keep hanging on in this hour there's not time to give up it's not time to to to to throw in the towel and say when is the lord jesus coming huh huh you know or delaying his coming you know you may not be saying oh I hope I hope the Lord comes later I hope I hope he comes later you know how you say that by the things you do the things you do and the things that you engage in really show what you think about the coming of the Lord if you're just fully just all you're thinking about is this life and about and about what I'm gonna you know things of this and you're just fully given into this and less to this word it shows where you're really where your heart is because Jesus Christ said where your heart is there were your treasure be awesome or where your treasure is there will your heart be also you see you may not be saying it Lord just wait until wait until I get married and then then you can come no it's just your actions will show that you you don't want the little coming of the Lord you don't want this word you want the earthly fleshly things of this life amen I hope that's not the case praise God amen praise the Lord Saints now so the be like brother Bob amen I need some water I think brother Bob did a wonderful job on Sunday amen I think he did he did good praise the Lord really enjoyed the word amen so Saints the all this inheritance God has given to us already you see my question is so what I was getting to was if Jesus Christ was given all power both in heaven and earth and he said that it was right then why is it that you and I are not manifesting this power in our life think about it he has he has everything under subjection right both in heaven and earth he said that he did then why are his children not manifesting that same power in this hour if we're to his children if we're born of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life amen why now you think about it on this line remember when the children of Israel when they were walking in the wilderness leaving Egypt God said that I will I'm giving you a land that's flowing with milk and honey and they were not even at that land yet yet God had told them I've given it to you it's theirs right it's theirs but they needed to go and possess it right so you see the promises of God is for you and I there are ours this whole the redemption of a body the the the the raising of the Saints amen all these things are for us God has given us all these things but we need to come to a place amen where we possess those things amen you see it wasn't like when you read in Joshua chapter 1 Amen when they crossed over to the to the to the promised land it was until the crossing that they actually took possession right but they need it they needed to stick with the Word of God that God had already told them to amen the Word of God had already said I've given you this land I've given you this land then Moses went off the scene and Joshua Amen then took over and they needed to continue / moving on to the to the promised land it wasn't until they crossed over to the promised land that they fully took possession of that promise right but what what what kept them for them to continue moving under they had to hold on to that word that was given to them you see and you and I Saints we have to continue holding on to this word that was given unto us amen this word of God the Word of God amen the promises of God and the message of the hour continue to hold on to these things don't get tired don't get weary amen and one day these things will come out in its fullness out of you amen then the fullness of the revelation of Jesus Christ will be manifested through you amen then you can fully say the the revelation of Jesus Christ that was given unto me amen not just to Jesus if you are part of him a man it was given unto you - amen but it needs it you need to continue it is it's a multi-layered revelation don't get sleepy on me please amen it's a multi-layered revelation amen praise God now let's read let's read quote 6 amen I'm getting to something so I appreciate your patience now the same thing is this if you are a son of God and if I and if I am a son of God or a daughter of God we were in God at the beginning but we were not there rolling around and jumping and shouting and nothing like that like you you think when you hear that when you first come into the message we say they say oh we were in God you know and you think I was there shouting and jumping and stuff like that really but brother Branham said that you didn't even you even exist they there was no existence of you only in his mind because you were an attribute of him you were not little like brother Dell says you were not little specks inside inside God's body amen and and look what brother Bram says here and when Jesus became the fullness of the word I thought he was the fullness of the word already and when Jesus became the fullness of the word then we were in him germ form ah when he remember he said that all power heaven and earth was given unto me when after the resurrection right now brother Bram said but we'll just let him sit when he was crucified we was crucified in his body why why were we crucified in his body what does that mean because the we were part of that eternal life that he had right we were part we were in him amen when he arose from the dead we rose with him that eternal life was still working there and now since we have recognized that now we set together with him in heavenly places in Christ Jesus praise God see for he we if we are sons and daughters of God we are God's children then we are attributes of God then we were got eternal life after you've recognized after your new birth amen and God is the only eternal life there is then we were in him from the beginning when you have eternal life amen at the new birth amen that's when you have eternal life praise God we didn't come here with eternal life yeah well let brother branham say that here and a following and following quote he says and God is the only ternal life there is then we were in him from the beginning and when Jesus became all that word again I thought he was all the word when he was here on earth no he had to grow as well just like you and I have to grow amen in the fullness of the word then we were a part of him then amen there you are when that's in there there is no devil no powers no nothing can ever move it that's the type post of the soul that is the revelation of Jesus Christ amen because why the the gates of Hell cannot prevail against that that's why he says here no devil no powers know nothing can never move it when you have the full revelation of Jesus Christ dwelling in you amen scroll it scroll down brothers now watch what he says here that lady was seeing church eggs naked blind miserable don't even know it see it's out it's that anointed anointed with the real spirit see that Holy Spirit can fall upon a man in his spirit but his soul is his germ that germ is the word amen that germ is the word it's not a literal germ is his word amen when his word is in you amen then you can have eternal life amen you have to hear the word first right you have to hear the word first then God can quicken that word amen and bring you and give you the new birth praise God amen so now let's let's let's move down to amen the tabernacle of Moses amen I love the tabernacle of Moses because it has its it just typifies Christ in so many aspects I mean it it speaks of Christ now in the real tabernacle this is this was shown this way because really all these layers that it has it's fully it's it's actually was actually covering the whole tabernacle you see so they only that the person that drew this drew it this way so that you can see under those layers right but you think about this saints this layer right here this look this is a badger skin layer the Bible says that on the outside of it that bet that it was going to be a layer or a covering of badger skins now to me I don't know about you but I think that's ugly I don't know about you but I think that's ugly I mean to me if it was me if I was making the tabernacle I would put the be most beautiful one on the outside right because I want to be I want people to say hey that looks sharp you know it looks good that's a nice Tabernacle you got there [Music] but God told Moses in the making if you read this in the book of Exodus I believe it is how he wanted this to be made he wanted on the outside as that tabernacle was going for it to be made out of badgers camp badger is an animal right a bunch of fur doesn't look pretty maybe if you like fur coats maybe that might look nice to you but that's ugly but that's how God amen but the people didn't understand that within that tabernacle dwelleth all the fullness of God dwelleth though the dwelleth God was dwelling in that tabernacle you see but on the outside it then looked like it on the outside it looked like a what in the world is that and then in the middle of walking in the desert and all these things my goodness what did people think about about seeing something like this you see and you and I Saints are living in this world walking in the middle of this desert and some of us are just as ugly as ugly can be I include myself in there where we're not we're not people you know that that the world we're not Hollywood stars we don't we're not shiny we're not we're not you know the beautiful people that people think oh my goodness muscles and all kinds of stuff we're not you know we're not that way but people don't understand that even though we don't look that way a man God still dwells in you full fully amen and he's pleased to dwell in you he wasn't just pleased to dwell in Jesus Christ he's pleased to dwell in you you who has made a badger skin he's pleased to dwell on you sister Susan I won't say anymore amen praise God amen so in in in saying this this is you see when somebody would go under here they would go under to the tabernacle and they'd go in and they'd see all these different layers let's say that maybe they were coming from the back end of the tabernacle they would pull up one layer okay I got through the the Badger skin oh wow this is so nice now this is a beautiful red tapestry type type of you know this is beautiful I could wrap myself with this you know and just but then all of a sudden they've realized that there's another layer under that layer they thought that layer was good but then they realized there's another layer under that and then they find out and they say oh my that's wonderful this is good this is oh this is awesome and then they realized there's another layer under that and it just seems to get better and better and better each layer that they go you see it's like an onion peel like where the way talks about pulling out the different layers the different layers amen until it finally you go in and you realize that's God in there amen but you have to go through all the layers you see and this is like the revelation of Jesus Christ multi-layered in in you and I you don't dump everything all at once God God knows that not to dump everything all at once in you because you won't be able to handle it you you parents who have children you can't dump every not everything that you've learned through your the years that you've grown up all in your children just like that no you can because you vote you would overwhelm them you would frustrate them you would overwhelmed them and saying thank God with us you see I can't give the example is always given but I can't give Zoe my car keys because she has no idea how to drive yesterday she just learned how to turn on the wipers because I showed her that's all she's gonna do for now I would not expect for me to give her my keys and say here Zoe can you drop Bella to school please she wouldn't have won I clue about how that car turns now she might because someone she's smarter than you think but she's very observant but I wouldn't trust her with my keys same thing with God with us there are certain times when he knows you got you can handle this revelation and then there's all right he's taking he and she has been able to come to this they they've exercised this and there's fullness now can pour a little bit more in there amen until it's revealing Christ amen little by little that's why the statue of the perfect man is the way it is faith virtue knowledge all that is revelation each virtue is a revelation to you amen and it's not a revelation that you get from your own it's something that the Holy Spirit has to produce in your life amen the Holy Spirit is the one who gives you holy faith holy virtue holy knowledge temperance and patience got all these things you don't have it in you but God has it in him amen and he's able to give it to you praise God amen praise the Lord amen so the brothers can turn that off for just a moment Olivia don't you come up come here I got a gift for you I asked your dad and he said like we were able to give you this gift and I want you to go ahead and open this gift for you it got a little wet but you know but we're you know we think so much of you and we appreciate you so much huh revelation one revelation 2 huh dude you just keep going keep going my wife right don't get impatient now it's not time to give up throw in the towel you got to keep going move on with these revelations move on with the revelation of Jesus Christ you see it's getting more beautiful and more beautiful each time right it's getting more and more beautiful you stop but if you continue in this word the Bible says amen three four five six we're in the low to see in church age now seven right here later see you I understand that they're not show the people that this is what happens when you're patient with the word and let the word amen you get the headstone you get Christ you get the headstone amen and you get the full word of God amen now that's not that's not for you I'm taking all these back yeah it don't spend it all in one place Thank You Olivia amen praise God I hope you get my point amen you have to go through through you have to go through faith virtue knowledge patience amen but that revelation those layers keep getting better and better each time see Olivia has she had to stay with it right then she was able to get amen amen the full word amen now it's all dwelling in you already right but why are we still here 50 years after the seals have been open I thought they were open it's because you and me have not caught the full revelation of this of this word you and me I have not amen somebody's gonna catch this because somebody's gonna call the dead from the ground the Saints they're waiting on for you and me in this hour praise the Lord amen so watch what brother Branham says here so what is the revelation of Jesus Christ if the brothers could bring up number seven says so the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ amen and it was wrote by prophets hebrews 1:1 and God who in sundry times spake to the father's by the prophets in this last day speaks to us through His Son Jesus Christ which was the prophets all of them put together let me ask you this who is God speaking through in this hour is it a different person than Jesus Christ no it's still Jesus Christ but Jesus Christ in you and me amen because the world is you and I are the only Jesus Christ that this world will ever see and there's God's Jesus Christ still speaking through you and me amen Jesus was Malachi Jesus was Jeremiah Isaiah Elijah all that they were were in him and all that you are and all I am brother branham speaking of himself is in him look what he says his words witnesses of the word I like that amen that's why Paul said that you and I are written in pistils both red and all man what does that mean you and me are like written letters that somebody's reading letters that somebody is reading amen we're words amen being witnesses of the word amen which is Jesus Christ so it is not a book of systems a code of moral ethics neither is it a history book or a book of theology it's not the Bible it's not just a book of rules of dudes do's and don'ts that's not what God wanted it to be it's not a history book either although there is history in it amen but you and I are in their saints amen and the prophets were building the body of Christ as they would speak about Jesus Christ they were building the body of Christ amen until finally he came in his full and he came when he came here on earth that was the son of man praise God but it's a revelation of Jesus Christ God Himself revealed from word to flesh now listen to this pay attention to this because what is that revelation of Jesus Christ that's what it is the Bible is the word and God is the flesh God and God is the word rather in Jesus being the flesh that's what he meant it's the revelation how God the word was manifested in human flesh and revealed to us now that's what the revelation of Jesus Christ is is the revelation of how God the word revealed himself through flesh and it happened in the life of Jesus Christ he had to come and reveal and come in the in flesh because he had to make a way for a people for salvation for a people that was to come ahead of him later on in him being God he had without no sin without nobody could put a finger on his life he was the only one worthy to be able to die for us and make a way so that you and I so that he can have sinners saved by grace come and be just exactly like he is not in their own merit because you and me came in this earth speaking lies and and and and and and sinners and that's why we have to be saved by grace but you see he had to he did it first that's why he's the firstfruits Amen of all these things and paved the way so that he can have a multi-member body that there was gonna so that he can produce a resurrection through this bride and then also a change of glorification of the body amen he wasn't just gonna keep that just for himself he wanted to share that glory with you and I Saints amen praise the Lord and that's why he becomes a son of God he is part of God you understand brother Brown says amen praise God so as I was saying earlier Saints that's why you have to be rooted amen in the word Amen not be like a leaf brother but the Paul said don't be like a leaf tossed to and fro you see the being carried away with every wind of doctrine here comes some some visitors raise the Lord I'm glad they made it safe brother Dale and brother wait and breath Don amen so we can't be like a leaf carried away with all doctrines and all kinds of things I mean we have to know where we're standing young people we have to know you have to know you have to know God for yourself don't just depend but mom and dad you know my mom and dad they'll be able to help me out or reward know there's gonna come a point in time where your mom and dad is not gonna be there I'm sorry to say mommy and daddy are not always gonna be there well you know we're not promised we're not promised always to be living on this life some of us may lose our mom and dad before we've gotten a certain age some of us have that's already happened to us you see you're not promised that we pray for our mom and dad that's why you have to pray for your parents pray for them and you pray for your family and say Lord protect put a shield around them but it's a vist their time to go God's gonna take him and he's doing it for a reason and what are you gonna do then you can't you can't you you have to depend you have to depend on God amen and say Lord mom and dad took me this far and you have to lead me the rest of the way it's a dark world out there but lord I know that through I can make it through all this darkness amen god bless you stranger good to have you in the house of God good that brother done with us praise the Lord amen so let's read a sweet quote number eight how many love the Lord praise the Lord amen where the BAM says here then he was made actually human flesh and dwelled among us in the person of Jesus Christ himself born of the Virgin Mary he come in that form so he could die and went back into heaven now in this last days he has promised to manifest himself in the fullness again of his flesh in spirit now he says in this last days God has promised to reveal himself again or to full manifest themselves again amen praise God see for as it was in these days in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man so do you believe a man that we're living in the days of Sodom I believe it's even worse than Sodom that's why brother Branham said that if God does not punish America for her sins amen he would have to pick Sodom and Gomorrah back up and apologize to them if he does not punish this country for their sins not just this country but the world around us in the in the anointing that it's under you see Satan is the god of this evil age so I think I believe it's worse than Sodom and Gomorrah now look at the Sodom how it's said and what taking place and Jesus Christ being manifested in bodily form of his church today see doing the same thing same work same things that he did all the time never changes the eternal one see and upon earth today he has manifested himself in the human bodies our human bodies he makes it personal oh well God killed surely God can won't do that to me look what I did yesterday if you repented of it you don't have to worry about that anymore it's all under the blood as a matter of fact he was under the blood when he died for you on the cross of Calvary praise God our human bodies that he has called and done exactly the same thing he'd done in sundried times and in the times of his flesh upon the earth and doing the same thing today because God and sundry times spoke to the fathers through the prophets in this last days through His Son Jesus Christ are you his son are you Jesus Christ amen he said he wants you to confess it why are we so afraid to confess who we really are you know and it's and it's at that time when when the bride starts becoming to say me and my father are one and you watch that's when persecutions really gonna start striking but if it's the truth they're not persecuting you they're persecuting God they're persecuting the truth see the son being revealed in the last days God manifested in human flesh setting just before Sodom's destruction the end of the Gentile world you see it there is three manifestations now the next thing happens is when it's all gathered up into that one person Jesus Christ bride and body at the physical return of the Lord Jesus making his three times when he was brought on earth killed crucified raised up manifesting his self in the form of his body which is his bride the woman amen that's the only Jesus Christ that the world's gonna see in this hour you get it she is part of his body I'm trying to go a little quicker here and the bride today is taken out from the body of Christ which is acting and doing just exactly like he said it would do for this day the bride the queen king and the queen all right amen praise the Lord Jesus amen God wants you to confess amen that you are him and that he is you amen jesus said when when he was here on earth when you seen me you've seen the father amen praise God and God wants you to say the same thing when you see me not-not-not i'm nothing with him with with my flesh and my my spirit now nothing but that soul that if god's soul is dwelling in you in the form of the holy spirit amen you're just as God as he is amen just as much God as he is praise God amen I want I want I wanna I want you to we're almost done but I want to talk about something here in the in in the book of Revelation now we read read here in revelation 1:1 it says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him right I say which God gave unto you a month but it's unto him right because you are him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John Amen so the actual revelation or the this word has been with us for over you know for over 2000 for two thousand years the Bible has been written the revelation has been there the Book of Revelations has been there for a long long time and God and Jesus showed this to John showed these things to John yeah John even though he was showing these things to John John couldn't fully comprehend what was going on right now remember John is a type of the bride but the Brenham said that john is a type is a type of the bride so even at us seeing John they're seeing what God was showing him they're on the Isle of Patmos John might have thought that's that's amazing that's powerful that's wonderful but he still didn't get a revelation of what that was now I want you I want us to if the brothers in the back they could turn if they could go to revelations chapter 10 if they could bring up that Scripture Revelation chapter I don't have it in but they could bring up the the Bible revelations chapter 10 because it's like us you see it's like the it's like the multi-layered the multi-layered rappers but Wade you missed today's what is but it's like the different layers you see that's sure this layer was wonderful right and in in in Olivia it probably surprised her when she saw that oh wow that's pretty cuz she said it she said that's pretty and then she got to the other one oh wow that's pretty but there was more oh that's pretty but there's more that's pretty but there's more you see right and so that's how it's like you and me you know we come into this message and we see one thing we see one wowthat's we see one god praise God and you feel like that's oh my you've gotten a hold of something you've gotten a hold of the whole world once you see one God revelation of one God and then you realize and you start looking more into the word and God starts showing you statue of a perfect man and starts showing you that uh corn the cornerstone amen the headstone became the cornerstone and all these things and Zerubbabel and all these different things you see it's Deb those rappers just coming unfolding unfolding unfolding amen and that's how it was with John and Mathers John was seeing all these things that you and my the you and I read in the book of Revelation and it was more real to him than it is to us go up I was just reading it but it was the revelation of Jesus Christ now look what it says here in Revelation chapter 10 it says and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire who is that speaking of it's nothing but Jesus Christ amen and he had in his hand a little book open I want you to see that the book was open that little book was open it was not closed and it was not half open it was open fully open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices write those mysteries amen and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not in the angel which I saw stand upon the sea upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven earth and the things that therein are in the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer amen so that little book was open he meant to Christ amen when he can't raise from the dead amen he would he said all power is given unto me both in heaven and earth hey man that book was opened unto Him amen that's the reason why it says that but yet it still was not open to John right now watch this because remember as when he said there were seven thunders they uttered their voices in other words and well let's just keep reading it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets we know that speaks of the angel they men they came in this hour day amen and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book it Riddle rates which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth amen you see how detailed the scripture is don't just take the little book take the little book that's open any man in the hand of the angel which is Jesus Christ right and why and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book why didn't he say give me the open book because it wasn't open to him and and he said up to me take it give it give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make that belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey so he obeyed and he said and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it he didn't say as soon as I had eaten up three quarters of it or or half of it ain't half of it I saved the rest of it for tomorrow no he said as soon as I got that book and I ate it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou Jesus Christ said unto Him and remember bright John types the bride thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings amen so John that book was not open to him until that book was in him when that book is in you amen that journal life is in you amen then you can say the full revelation of Jesus Christ dwelleth in me amen praise God amen it's that's why it's but it's you have to eat the book now we in this our day we're eating little by little right I can't take a whole pizza and swallow it whole that'd be kind of tough to do maybe somebody with big old mouth might know but most people would not be able to eat a whole pizza right you have to eat it by slices amen and it's the same thing in this our day you have to take this revelation by slices amen but even that one slice Saints even that first slice it's still God you're born at faith that's born again when you're born again at faith that's full that's God dwelling in you just as much as that last slice right that seventh slice is just as much God amen until finally the whole thing is in you amen and you gulp it down with a coca-cola praise God amen so it's not until that whole book a man is in you amen that you can that that full revelation amen is is amen and when that revelation and now now I like I like that it says they says that you must prophesy again it reminds me it reminds me of of those of those of Ezekiel's dry bones amen remember memories equals dry bones and when the God told Ezekiel and said prophesy unto these bones when he was in that in that little Valley and he saw a bunch of dead bones everywhere he said prophesy unto these bones and he did he said exactly what about what the Lord told him to say to those bones the bones came up and and and and and they got they they they put flesh they put flesh on them a flesh was put on them and all the bones were coming together and things like that and you thought what cable that was great that was wonderful but the but the Bible continues to saying that same scripture he told him to prophesy again amen if you keep reading and say you prophesy again and and and and say winds from the from the four of probably what it was four four corners or something like that you say and bring life to these bones that they might live and it was until that life came to those bones then those bones started moving amen it's not until though the life of God amen it's not until it's not until that fullness amen the full this broad must prophesy again amen and once he prophesized again with with conviction with this full word in her with this fullness of the revelation of Jesus Christ dwelling in you then you can call the dead from the ground amen think about that with Ezekiel's bones when when they were zekiel prophesied again and that life came to those bones amen then you as the Bride of Christ with this fullness of the revelation can prophesy again and those those Saints are gonna have to hear those dead Saints they're gonna have to listen to that prophecy and say my goodness somebody's calling me my loved ones calling me I better go amen praise the Lord think about that sense that's lovely Lokar brother Brennan says here in in in in the ninth in the ninth one the brothers could bring it up the ninth quote now this messenger of Malachi for in Revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi for he will turn the hearts of the children to the father's two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals that's what those seven thunders are there are in the seven seals but are we in the seven seals are we looking into the seven seals are we really digging into the seven seals amen because those seven thunders amen are within the seven seals is what brother Branham said there it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so brother brother Dale reads that rossette quote many times amen now the brothers could bring the the picture the next picture Amen just uh the church age I guess I guess it's not there that the seven church ages praise God amen praise the Lord hmm now it's through these seven layers amen that God is building his body amen praise God and I've said before I just for me this is just me I know what the dark parts represent I know that that's the darkness within the age and stuff like that but if you're looking at it from far off to me it just seems like it's a body that's laying down like this you know that's just to me you know I don't say that as a doctor or nothing like that and at the end time that body's gonna raise amen because at the end Saints when you're when you're raising in from the bed at in the morning what raises first your feet well my hand raises first maybe it does to turn off the alarm clock put it on snooze about five times that's what Minds does you know I'm late all the time I need to I need to put that snooze that phone in somewhere else you pray for me but you see Saints and and I can't help to think it's like that movie that old movie Frankenstein you know I hate to use this analogy remember when when that wind a scientist or that doctor or whatever his name was I think it was that was his name okay I thought Frankenstein was the monster all right you see a dad on my 80s and 90s kid all right but you see he had this body that he wanted to Turay he wanted to create a body something that was living and walking I don't know all the story but he finally got it built out right and at the end he needed a brain right he needed you needed he needed so something to give it to give it so they can have life right and that's the same thing Amen Saints and this hour amen brother Branham talks about how how the body was built from the feet first amen and on down up to the to the to the to the head to the intelligence right or to the UH to the eyes to the prophetic you know and then now to the head to intelligence right amen which is Jesus Christ amen that headstone praise God and then saying say man when this when this when when the bride catches a man whom she really knows what she understands what she really ours and it's revealed to her amen that's the reason why this the Saints are coming out the ground amen right god this body is raising amen praise God that's why the Bible says that the first shall be last and the last shall be first amen amen because why the heads coming up first us the 11th hour workers and all that right we get the same payment that right but we get the furtherance of the revelation amen that's why this parts coming up first amen and then these will follow Amen praise the Lord Jesus I hope that that that you see that a little bit different Amen I mean not not any doctor or anything like that but I just that's just how I see that Amen praise God now brother Branham says says here in in in quote number 10 we're almost done oh not 10 I'm sorry number 9 oh no 10 10 yes and his body will do the works that he promised like in mark 16 and so forth his body was not held in the grave but was recognized with him in the resurrection do you get it then the body of his believing children will not be held in the grave when he comes but will be recognized with him because he died for the purpose to resurrect his bride the body but he had to resurrect first right recognized because it is his body because it's the words let's scroll down is there more his word which is which he is has been has been begin to be risen amen is that words begin to be risen in you and I amen praise God the word that down through the age of Luther Wesley C has began to raise up to its power there it began to move then it moved a little more now it's coming up to an identification Amen it's coming up to and I'd ever just like the rapper's amen it's finally coming up to an identification amen of who Christ is they men see watch now to the life in the body is a vindication of the rapture is at hand well in other words when that resurrection takes place that's of indication that the rapture is at hand amen because there's life then right and dr. Frankenstein is saying is alive its alive you can say they're alive they're alive they're alive and the rapture takes place it's a vindication of the rapture is at hand when you see the headship in the body becoming one and the fullness of the measure of his manifestation shows that the body is about ready to be received to the headship Amen praise the Lord Jesus amen and then the brothers can bring up the last picture amen this is what we want to come to saints amen Christ and the brighter one I loved this picture amen because it's the body of Christ being built just like the body of Christ was built through and the Old Testament throughout all the Old Testament by the prophets the word amen the word that they had for their time was building the body of Christ in layers until finally it came to a head and he came to a when he came when he came here on earth it was in its apex then right that was the son of man praise the Lord and then the same thing Amen in the Son of Man turn that headstone was rejected by the by Israel right turn to be the cornerstone right and so now the body is being built again through these seven Church ages right until finally it's gonna make its apex amen a culmination which is Christ amen be in the head praise God I hope that helps you a man I hope it wasn't boring to you I hope that you get something out of it and then you take it with you and ponder it and Saints don't just look at this one time and say okay I got it amen look at it again and read Amen go over these quotes amen because we are still here my body is still not redeemed I'm confessing I'm confessing it my body I still needed a redemption of these bodies amen we still need that we're still waiting for the for the metaphor the manifestation of those the Saints that are dead to come amen I'm expecting to see brother Richard I'm expecting to see Gary I'm expecting to see my mother-in-law I'm expecting to see all these brothers is that you all know people who have died in Christ they're not here with us yet that means there's something we're not kept kept capturing yet we haven't gotten this the potential we have the potential of the revelation of Jesus Christ dwelling in us but it needs to manifest on the outside amen so the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to you it's already yours that's why I like God uses past tense a lot of times because too in his mind it's already done and if you read that in Revelation chapter 1 verse 1 it says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to him but put yourself in their the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to you and you confess that and you build on top of that and watch you let you be in the same image as that headstone amen praise the Lord how many love the Lord Hey praise God let's stand to our feet a man I don't have musicians come praise the Lord let's just sing a little something and then uh well uh well dismiss quickly with that brother Wade brother Donny brother they'll get some rest amen if you have a need tonight amen will be more than glad to pray with you praise the Lord can we sing the old rugged cross man 2:52 [Music] all the hill far away stood an old rugged cross [Music] of suffering and shame [Music] do my trophies [Music] amen that's how you start linked into the cross surprise repent be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost [Music] as the one attraction [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey man praise the Lord Jesus I hope you have a good rest of the weekend all that all hearts and minds are clear amen so if I'm missing anything or anything like that more than welcome to let it be known I appreciate my wife for taking the time today wrapping those multi seven multi layered gift she we even went out and bought the wrapping paper and everything so so I give her she gets most of the credit for that amen the idea was here but she's that one who actually took it and put it into place say man so I appreciate my wife for her patience with that a man you love the Lord amen so let's just pray for one another and let's just be dismissed and in a word of Prayer our Heavenly Father we thank you once again for your love mercy and grace we thank you for your word that we were able to hear father a portion lord help us to take this portion father in our heart make it personal to us that we may become more and more like you Lord we just commit ourselves into this the rest of this evening and the rest of this week bring us back father Sunday Lord to receive father what you have in store for us through your word Lord we just love you and we commit ourselves into you now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen god bless you [Music] you [Music]
