fulfilled in every way Lord Jesus and Lord we just want to identify with that that you are fulfilling your word Lord Jesus in our midst Lord and Lord Jesus we want to be able that to open our eyes to see Lord God what you're doing in our day and age Lord Jesus that we like the woman at the well could be able to say uh you know say that Christ will be doing these things and then you identify

what we have need of knowing in this day and age Lord Jesus Take me out of the way Lord God I in no way can say that I'm any kind of a Preacher Lord God or a minister even Lord Jesus but I know Lord

dwelling within us Lord Jesus and Lord God we know that it's your promise Lord God and we believe your promises Lord Lord Jesus Take me out of the way Lord God and let your spirit Lord God speak to your people Lord Jesus you know what they have need of Lord God you know what I have need of speak to us all Lord Jesus and identify yourself Lord God once again in our midst in Jesus name amen amen amen what a speaker I've never it sounds interesting praise the Lord amen uh want to talk to you a little bit about uh some scriptures let's go in the scripture to uh to St Luke the 16th chapter I mean St Luke the 4th chapter the 16th verse um and uh it's a familiar scripture that's been uh it's been talked about several times as you've as we've been in this message and it's referring to Jesus when he when he read The Scroll of the prophet Isaiah and uh it's uh St Luke 4:16 and it came and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as is as his custom was he went unto the synagogue on the Sabbath on the Sabbath day and stood up to uh for to read stood up for to read and there was and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it is written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel unto the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted and to preach the Deliverance to the captive and Rec recovery of sight unto the blind to S set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and Jesus stopped right there and he didn't go on with that scripture he kind of cut it off in half the scripture uh you can look that up the the actual scripture that he was reading is in Isaiah 61 uh 1 and uh so you'll find that uh and I I I marked that also but you'll find that he stopped there because he's because brother Bram explained he stopped there mainly because that next part of that scripture was for the coming to of judgment or the or the or his second coming not his first coming so now you can be seated as we you know uh I was uh listening to to some of the tapes uh where brother Brown was talking about when he was in birth pains and and uh uh you hear him talk uh witness about that a few times times where a priest got up to give him the scroll give him to read out of his Bible because uh brother Brown's Bible had stuck together two pages and uh you find out that uh you know when brother B testifies of of it he often says well exactly what you know he says that the priest told him Stand Fast the the the Lord's about to do something right you know but listening to the tape itself the very words that that priest said was this is God's breath I think it was breath and I'm wasn't sure of that word there is a reason why it is it was done there's a reason why the pages was stuck like that there's a reason why it was done God will show you something to bring out to bring out of this and it's wonderful amen those are the actual words of the priest on the tape right but brother Brown says you know God is fixing to move and uh and and you can see why you know he kind of paraphrased I guess what the priest was actually trying to say but you start to find out that if we look at the scripture and we look at the the way that uh that God's revealing himself and I want to talk a little bit about uh what has been fulfilled what is what what is yet to be fulfilled and what part is the bride playing in the Fulfillment of the scriptures amen and you start to wonder well you know who am i y who who am I uh uh that that I have any part to do in this you know God's way bigger than me he brought forth a message he did a mighty mighty work in our day and age he's manifested himself in our day and hour and he's done some great works and he's actually revealed so much to his bride for this last day but what part do I have to play in this and we'll get to that a little later but watch watch we when we look at the Fulfillment of scriptures we look at the the day and age we live in we we often think well you know A lot's gone by you know A lot's gone by it's just it just rolled on real fast since since brother bam was even here you can't you say well did some people have said has brother did brother brandham actually talk about the attack on the Twin Towers did brother brandham actually you know that's a major event didn't he see it coming and and speak of it in some tape they say well didn't brother bam actually see the crushing of the economy like it's happening today or did he ever see the the the banks falling apart or the or did he see the the the the but you know what let me let you know that there has to be the course of events right that the events that will bring the that bring into position the things that that are to be for example the prophecies brother Brown said the Fulfillment of the word word of God or should he say the the the interpretation of the word of God is for it to come to pass so now how how do we get how was it that that we're going to get uh okay let's go into the Old Testament a little bit how are we going to get Ahab to get killed and his blood run out in the spot where nebot was killed yeah right how are we going to bring the chain of events how are we going to make things happen so that this thing comes to pass so you see what's in God's mind where he's setting everything up he set he's he's setting the stage for every event that's spoken of by the word of God for this hour to come to place how you going to say well there's a persecution how are we going to say that the World Council of churches gets the power to come back and look for you personally as message Believers where are they going to get where why are they singling you out anyway you're good people why would they single you out as good people and say you're doing something illegal you're doing something wrong we must get rid of you we must send you to the concentration camps up there in in Siberia or Alaska or whatever right how can these event even now my mind is almost baffled wondering how could this event or how could this persecution come up come on but then you start to look at how the chain of events starts happening you start to look at what's yet to be fulfilled right you wonder what would the change be when California goes under the sea over there what's going to bring the pressure on when when uh when when you see uh people singling out like the pope Coming to America all right and waving his hand over America and saying I'm sorry the Catholic Church did such horrible things oh yeah and I'm sorry that the that we will make restitutions we got the money we'll pay you guys we'll pay you guys for all the damage we did yeah but I'm really interested in all the denominations that America has to offer I need you know when in in my interpretation he's really thinking about I need to set up an image unto me yeah right in the United States right I need to control this sure this is out of my control and I need to control it right you say that's just be paraphrasing but I could imagine where it's where it's going to where it's coming from I I I I I heard him on his speeches and I heard what he said but I didn't understand why he was so interested in the denominations of this United States absolutely amen why did he have such an interest in it is because he's going to manipulate and there will be an exercise power given because it's already come forth right the message has already told us it's going to go that way right now you wonder where would a bank falling apart or the housing market falling apart or this nation's economy falling apart or go on down to to looking at uh and and it's hitting us as individuals when we start looking for jobs and stuff it it the economy falling apart what does that have to do with the Fulfillment of scripture what does it have to do with the with with the world in and its position it's in right now right we don't we don't know exactly the details of what's going to ma uh make these things Trigger or have come to pass but we do know that we've got the tapes and we can go back and we can see what the prophet of this hour has expressed and it's already been said exactly it will not fall to the ground without being fulfilled in other words uh and and and and you know when when Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive he had no idea right right what he was really saying right if you go into the history they say that there was a prophecy given way before Isaiah said that there will be a virgin that conceived there was people saying amongst the the the uh what do they call those uh the the the worldly or or should I say the the pagans that there will be a virgin that conceived and and when Isaiah said it it's because it was a prophecy coming forth and it had to come to pass Mary had no idea that it was going to be her right right until she stood there in front of the Angel and that angel explained to her that she was the one to fulfill that scripture Y what would be of you if you're going to stand there and and and and the Lord comes to you or or the Lord has through this message is revealing to you what part you're to play come on brother in the Fulfillment of God's word come on I'll tell you there are some things that you've got to do as message Believers you got to have faith to believe that God's word is infallible on you got to have faith to believe that God's word will come to pass I don't care what the circumstances are I don't care what the symptoms are they will come to pass if we stand up and we say we believe that God can heal us we believe he did it for us 2,000 years ago I don't care what the symptom is we have confidence to believe that it will come to pass I don't care how much I hurt I don't care if the Bone's broken I don't care what it is I believe what God Said of it right and that's the that's the truth whether I can put my weight on it or not come on I believe what God Said right now that's where it comes too it comes to a bride that will take him at his word amen no matter what the feelings no matter what the circumstances are no matter what the symptoms are they believe God's word more than the symptom right right amen and they say that this is this is you know brother Brown said one time he said you know uh what what heaven or should I say what's what is in in the faith realm is more real than this realm we're in here so when we stand back and we say we stand and believe that God angels heaven is real when we have faith to believe God's word heaven is real or these things that this message that this that we say this is real this is more real than holding this Pulpit here or or coming to this church or getting in your car it's more real than you're you're getting a getting up to get to work in the morning it's more real than that and you say well how could it be more real than that because it's God's word and heavens and earth will pass away God's word will not pass away what we see here in material is less real than what is what God has promised us amen so how do we stand on his promises because it's real am amen hallelujah amen so here we are when we look at the at at at at what's what's been fulfilled or should when we start looking at the past when we look at we look at at prophecies given for this day and age when we look at the the condition of the world we can see that Sodom gomor has come upon us we can see that the that the that and and you know this thing was just just 30 years ago it was in the closet come nobody knew who was a homosexual right now they go on parades right you know uh let me tell you uh Los Angeles has no embarrassment about it come on right Santa New Mexico has no embarrassment about it come on you wonder why why can a whole place be popular they taking something as as as as pristine or as real to us message Believers as a rainbow and they make that their symbol Somewhere Over the Rainbow you know they're going to have their place where it's perfectly all right to be the way they are and they don't realize that judgments hanging over this world just you know like brother Brown said one time he says if if he allows this world to go on the way it's going he to have to raise up Sodor and apologize to it for burning them up for the sins they were doing amen see that's the condition and we're we're that's where we go shopping Santa Fe New Mexico you know and sometimes you could sit there I mean I mean we're in the f care uh set program and they want to raise children too men and men wanting to raise kids women and women wanting to raise kids you wonder why that's right you know what kind of kid would they raise right right you know have two mam or two daddies you know it's kind of strange but that's what they want you know and we wonder we wonder how Sodom s sodomy and all this is coming to the place where it's it's well accepted where even if you start to talk to Brethren they'll say well they are nice people yeah Brethren you talk to Brethren in this message and they'll say Well they're good people they got a good heart yeah but if they don't repent for that lifestyle they've got a judgment hanging over them right amen that's right they may be nice people but nice Don't Make christian that my nice doesn't make don't make bride that's right amen so watch we we look at what what what what was promised for our day and age we look at at at at the the Judgment of Sodom as we as the prophecy that Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of Lord uh son of man now watch this had to come to pass there had to be a Sodom condition Upon This Nation at the time of the revealing of the son of man that's the way the scripture writes it out it says this will be the condition of the world this is when the son of man will will come right right you know we're promised that when Jesus came he came as the son of man right okay he's came he's came as a son of man he'll become he came as a Son of God bless him he's revealing himself when the world gets in that Sodom condition once again as a son of man that's right then to the Jews he'll be revealed as the son of David and to the foolish virgin come on so we during the during the the tribulation period but watch what are we so we see that the that the events the things that are coming on this Earth are already saying it's here amen we're we're we're at his coming right we're at his we're we're at his manifestation we're at is uh the day of the son of man is here as it was in the days of Noah notice how how how how how the Lord said as it was in the days of Noah and then he comes to as it was in the days of the son of man right the days of Noah back in the uhhh brother Bam's years it was just a problem of marriage and divorce men were divorcing everywhere women were divorced everywhere wanting to be deacons and and preachers and all this stuff but nowadays it's come to the Sodom condition notice how it had to come in in in sequence notice how the word of God seems to never make a mistake it comes in its sequence on watch how the word of God manifests itself it's as as destruction is hanging over the Gentiles the revealing of the son of man to a called out people just like it was in Abraham's day a called out people catch the Revelation come on of the message of this hour to bring them to a rapturing faith believe that amen how could we get to a rapturing faith we can hardly get across the common cold you know uh we struggle with uh we struggle with the aches and pains that seem to plague us every day but what what are we doing we're we're we're a people that'll stand forth and say look I believe my faith rather than my aches and pains I'll believe the the the word of God rather than what I'm feeling amen that's right amen re you know and then and then we find that that as the church agents have ran their course and they man ested themselves we've come to the end of the church ages is leoa and leoa is already rubbing itself off on this message you say rubbing it you know I've heard ministers say and I believe somewhat that this message is not leoa Lea was Pentecost right when Pentecost lost the movement of the spirit and they went off to try and become a denomination the Holy Spirit came to move amongst the message Believers and no longer is working with Leo DEA so really the Shu stayed there and the wheat is now in the in the ripening where the sun can hit it and it's pulled away and it's the the wheat's now in the ripening of the sun and the wheat is the Original Seed the faith seat like Abraham's Royal seat that will believe the message of this hour okay I can understand that I can iron to that but you know I'm finding out that look what's happening in Lea it's happening amongst the message anymore you start to find out there's ministers that will will will cut themselves out and say if you don't believe it like I believe it you ain't got you're not part of the Bride you're not part of the Rapture you know one time they told me about the little story about trying to uh I don't know if you guys heard it in Pentecost back in the old days they used to say the the Never Die Doctrine you ever heard of that never die Doctrine they said well if you're going to you know we're so close to the coming of the Lord that we're not going to die anymore come on we're not going to go to the by way of the Grave come on we're going to be the ones that are changed in the moment in the twinkling and eye sound of the last trumpet wow that's a wonderful re I want to be part of that that's right amen I want to be part of I want to be changed I don't want to be I don't want to go to the Grave I want to be changed and they said well you got to believe it you got to have faith in it is all right I'm talking to the brother that are believing this and I says okay Brothers I says uh I said brother bab's in the grave right right well they says well yeah but he's not in this time yeah he's he's going to be raised up don't worry about him you worry about yourself you got to have the faith that you're not going to die okay okay I'll say this and I said well I said the sons of zebedy came up to Jesus mother of the sons of Zeb came to Jesus and said well I want my son to be uh at your right hand this other son to be at your left hand and Jesus says woman you don't know what you're asking come on brother she says well he says uh she says then he then Jesus says says to him are you able to drink of the cup that I'm to drink of he says yes we are able and he says and you are able right he knew it you are able to drink of the cup that I'm to drink he says but to sit at my right hand and my left hand it's not mine to give he says it's what it's already appointed to somebody for right then I says to my brother that was telling me about this Doctrine I says you know what I says there is a people that will be a rapturing people come on brother and there is a people that will be a resurrecting people right I says for me to call out and say I'm he isn't up to me I says it's Destiny it's destinated by God already who's going to be there as that come on I says I'd be privileged if I am one of the ones that raptured and I'd be privileged if I'm one of the ones that resurrect it's no difference to me what is the difference to me it's just for you to come up and tell me that I'm not part of the Bride because I don't believe it that way that's not right I says you got to back up and repent I says I'll be there whether you believe me to be there or not because I believe God's word and that's what's solid for me so you see when you but they want to cut you out when they have no right to cut you out right you know they want to cut you out and say if you don't believe the doctrines the way I believe it if you don't believe the the two Souls you're not part of it if you don't believe the back in Mexico there's some that believed that there was a certain brother that was Jesus Christ again and they're marching down the streets of Mexico saying Blessed Be he who comes to the name of the Lord if you don't believe him you're not part of it come on now you know what became them you don't hear about them no more you know and What Becomes of all these doctrines just like the one that Jesus that that that brought up a 40 and went up to the Wilderness that's right yep forerunning the name Jesus you realize that the devil seemed to forrun the name the name of that that's above all names he was forerunning it with a renegade come on right you know that got killed out there right so what is it seems like the devil already wants to forerun the events that this bride is inherit or going to be it's going to be the bride's inheritance so what is it what is what are we looking at fulfillment fulfillment we know we're in the days of Sodom we know we've already come to the place where this bride is catching a revelation of who she is what she's doing how what her what her part is to play now we come at the restoration of the brid tree looking at the adoption or the or the or the or the or even when we start looking at the at the at the Revelation that God gave to us when he brought forth the seals we start to look at the at the at the at the what the message is bringing bringing as we start to see the the the the the truth of God's word being opened up to his bride right and the faith seed that was originally given to the Saints of old which would stand there and believe God and pray for each other and have the faith to while even when Peter was in jail that's right okay going to be beheaded in the morning when a prayer meeting could change the situation and bring God on the seene and get Peter out of jail it's the same kind of thing that happens amongst the bride if she's able to have faith and believe and get to God In Prayer amen we realize the politics is rotten I mean we run politics to try and get a better situation in healthc care and my health care is going up and there went my rais if I got a raise which very little anyway so we wonder why why it doesn't seem like we ever get ahead it's because it's because politics is rotten we can't depend on it you know why would we cry out to when when when Katrina happened Bush save us why don't they cry out to Jesus to save them that's right bush has no salvation power and neither does does Obama or anybody else we got to look towards the the politics is rotten the economy's falling apart the nations are falling apart the job situations fall apart all to bring forth thus sayith the Lord in this day and age to bring the bride into position to be that Original Seed right the faith that was once delivered to the Saint is promised to the bride the bride tree amen the restoration of the Bride tree it's upon us and we got to just like I like like like uh uh what was his name uh bless him father excuse me he's a he's very a Jeremiah just like Jeremiah when he stood there and he read the books of the Prophet Daniel and he saw that hey in in so many years we'll be leaving this place we'll be living Babylon and I want to be ready so he goes into prayer and he says what's to become of my people and God sends an angel of God to reveal to him what's to become of his people and we get the whole scripture Daniel 70 weeks because God heard the prayers of a man that knew their desperation set upon him to set up and say look I know we're close to the coming of the Lord and I'm not ready and I'm not right and I got to get ready and I got to pray and I got to ask God and I got to have something God has to move on me personally God has to show me what I got to do right am mean you say well we're going to depend on brother Dale he's going to get us through we're going to depend on the brothers to get us through if we can we got to get start depending on thus sayth the Lord and God's revelation to come to you personally it's got to be a an individual Revelation that God's revealing to you what kind of spirit you should have what kind of time you should spend in what kind of of of of life you should be living amen just the basic things that God revealed to us you know I preached a sermon just the other day and it really struck me blessing it was the accursed things you say the accursed things where'd that come out of it was the accursed things that Joshua's Men that that Ain it's called the accursed things that aen went after and I went through and I just I wasn't even thinking I was just preaching what what what what was being revealed to me at the moment and I I said you know do we have any accursed things come on and I started going off you know with things brother Brandon preached about and they calling them are they the accursed things that would cause the whole church to crumble or how cause the whole church to have sin and then God won't won won't won't move because there's we've got a cursed things amongst us I heard testimony that some of the brothers just got up and got rid of their televisions yeah got rid of got rid of the of the magazines got rid of the the pants got rid of the the things that they they realized there's a a revelation comes forth that God's revealing to you work close to the coming of the Lord we've got to live a life higher worthy of this gospel come on worthy of this truth that's been given to us in our day and age that's right amen we realize we begin to realize like Jeremiah I need to know it's it's in me because there's something in me I need to be ready I need to be right I need to be in this position to be ready for the rapture right you know I know that you know what are you saying then oh it's going to take that persecution we're going to have to go up and be over there persecuted two lives you know if you to start have dreams like I've been having of nothing but concentration camp situations you don't want to be there that's right you don't want to be in a concentration camp I feel like I'm in Hitler's camps oh my over and over and over again my family killed dead myself being tortured come on knowing that there is no hope or Escape other than you can stand forth and say look I'm not going to say right that this message is wrong come on Amen you know I have you know and and and as as my wife was being taken away from me at that moment all I was saying is Lord receive her spirit right because I knew beyond any Shadow of Doubt that if I save my life here I'll lose it right right and you know what it doesn't matter come on brother this life you know I I have nothing to hide this life is not worth eternal life that's come on Amen the few years I have left ain't worth what I got over in the glory land amen hallelujah amen we believe you know it's been revealed to us God revealed to us God has called you out of all the world of people that will can understand that he would reveal himself in our day and age through a prophet messenger that he you know you know that he would come and say look I'm going to show you the truths that been hid Through the Ages I'm going to show you personally the the the the life that the gospel brings forth on a people called out to a higher calling I'm going to revealed to you personally you know how can we find out that you know how can we we we see that look throughout all the ages I could never tell you all the all the things that that God's doing but you see I I wouldn't be able to but I could tell you this the scripture revelations 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God will be finished that couldn't be fulfilled till the 20th century you say why because they didn't have magnetic magnetic tapes till just recently well I got the first real to reals I'm not that old I don't think all right I got the first real to reals that's what I used to get from spoken word for a dollar dollar a message right and I listened to them with an old real toore machine that wasn't working right so I had to keep putting my pocket knife on it and making it Buzz just to get back its magnetic so it work again to hear sermons like like like the world falling apart preached in Albuquerque this day this scripture is fulfilled the uh the you know those those those old messages that that you know I still hear them but you know they mean so much more today because I can see now amen all these things that have come to pass I knew nothing about the I'm Catholic I knew nothing about the Pentecostal realm I knew nothing about about about restoration of gifts tongues the power of God I knew nothing about the Revival that went by all I knew is holy Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners down at the hour our death amen yeah yeah you know our Catholic prayers our chants but you know what it's come to pass that as the word of God has manifested itself and revealed itself come on brother as the seals when I started seeing that the seals was bringing bringing out all the things hidden throughout all the ages right it's been sealed up through the years you know tell you a little bit about seals my mama used to like to can and I used to like to I I I liked her cherries she used to can cherries Bean cherries you know right and every so often she'd go out there to the chicken coop and she'd find a bottle of bean cherries just the bones in there and a spoon and she come up and she says who did this and I'm scared she goes fake me you know stealing the cherries you know and I I'm quiet and she she comes up to me she says Daniel she says you took these over there I says yeah I did she says I don't mind you eating the cherries she says but don't leave the bottle out there she says I'm going to bring it back and can again right you know brother she said don't leave the spoon out there don't leave the the the bottle out there she says bring it back I'll recan with it right she say you eat all the cherries you want right I said thank you Mama but you know what God in his grace sealed up things from the times of John the Divine Right and had it sealed up just to open it up to you this afternoon right it's for you amen my mama was

recorded and sealed up and saved on the so he can give it to you when you have need of it come on he's revealing it to you in this day and hour that's right to manifest it to a people that would have the faith seed enough to just believe it right just believe it that's all it takes is to believe now when we go back to my subject it's saying fulfilled fulfilled you know if we were looking through God's eyes we'll say she's a bright people that that that that's that's the ones that would accept this word yeah for this day and this hour that's the one that would accept the part that the fivefold ministry has to play that's that's the one that will will take God's word at at its face value come on but you see you stand here and you say I don't know right you know I'm still struggling with this I'm struggling with that but you start to realize I don't believe the symptoms oh my I don't believe what's pressuring me I don't believe my my I don't believe that you know my joblessness I don't believe anything that's coming to pass more than I believe what God promised amen I don't believe it I believe what God said it would be of me I believe what God declared I believe that he died for me a Calvary I believe that he he saved me I believe that I can live a life worthy of this gospel because God promised that he would have a people and I believe I'm part of that people you say no brother Daniel you're going back to saying well you're not part of the Bride because you don't believe you're going to be in the resurrection or that you're going you don't believe you're going to be one of the ones that's change changing of the body now I didn't say I'm I'm going to that that I'm trying to be what I'm not I'm trying to be what God Said I am right amen and I'm not going I'm not going to go any further than that cuz I believe God God promised and and he he gave he called out a people to be the ones that would take him at his word amen right amen you know when we look at at the day we live in we look at at the the message of this hour we look at what God's revealed in this day and age we know that the you know we know that the that the word of God has come to pass in our in our day and age to bring us to a place that's right where we're able to meet the challenge of our hour amen you say well what's our hour then what what coming upon us you know what as the the course of events happens and they come by and tell brother Dale to close his church oh and tell you guys you can't worship here no more where are you going to go what are you going to do right you know what do you you
