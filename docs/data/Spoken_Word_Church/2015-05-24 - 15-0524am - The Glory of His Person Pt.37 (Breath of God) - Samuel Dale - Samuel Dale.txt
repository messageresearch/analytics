Candlestick in the midst of the seven golden seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch with the golden girdle his head and his hairs were quite like wool as wide as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined Bryce if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters all right let's go over to John now and pick up our thought for today we'll go to John 20 and 19. in the same day at evening being the first day of the week now this remember this is after the resurrection this is coming through and he's already you know seeing a sin you know to Mary I go to my God and your God you know my father and your father and all the Nash coming to the resurrection part then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word foreign Richard for doing the fixing some lights back there as we're entering in I told him I said I can see who's coming in the door now you know and everything would appreciate it and two he worked out here cleaning up the uh playground and getting all of the things out and I came up and Terence did and we helped him a little bit one day and as far as we know there's not any snakes out there there was some little bitty small snakes that he found as he was raking leaves which is kind of normal at this time of the year nothing poisonous just a regular I call him a ground snake they got another name for him but we did put stuff around to try to deter them so you know you kids can play but just watch if you see something don't go wake up the neighborhood just get somebody and let them take care of the problem you know you know but you know just do that and and watch your steps and things but you know you find all you can and that's the best you can do you can't do it this is the time of the year of kind of animals moving around now we have been speaking about the new birth and talking about and found out what it is the new birth it's the birth of the word it's a birth of the word that you have heard and you take that word as the disciples did and you wait and they did finally say that it was come to an understanding and and then it says they would keep the word it would be opened unto them you know and it was and I want you to watch something very closely today as we try to talk about these things but remember now no matter how much words you hear that that word has still got to be quickened or made alive and you can say well I came with this seed in me all right now where's it at and what happened and if you come that way with eternal life what do you need Jesus Christ that's what a lot of people think you know they got quotes and all but remember quotes will kill you because we used to quote Matthew 28 19 right and we used to baptize father son the Holy Ghost right used to believe hell was eternal he used to have a whole lot of thoughts you know but they wouldn't line up with a word all right yet we had quotes for the point but just remember that that as I asked the question there the other day did is the New Birth the birth of the seed that we come we're here with or does it come like the Bible said that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word all right and the brother random remember said the seed was put in you before the foundation of the world so what were you before the foundation world he said only in the mind of God so now in the mind of God evidently he did he knew everybody would ever be saved and everybody'd ever be lost for the foundation of the world all right we'll go along with what the prophet says but when people try to interpret that thought see they bring it to I have this and I don't need anything else because if you do if you came in the world with eternal life you don't need no salvation now that I mean you just don't need it there's no need even talking about it but yet still we we want to do that you know what's so odd is the preachers don't realize I don't mean this comically but it's true and the preachers who preach all these doctrines about these seeds and things don't realize they do it away with their job foreign was eternal you don't need nobody to help you you don't need no preacher you don't even know God you don't need no savior you don't need nothing like that you just you know you just come to acknowledge of it and uh you know I I kind of comical to me that's all right but listen see then we look at the birth of the word and knowing that all natural births come the same way and all spiritual births come the same way and I know that's a little different call than what maybe you had considered but I would desire that you express it to me and explain it because I believe ever baby is born the same way and I believe ever born again Christian is Born the same way well see you're automatically got in there but actually I did I cried I done this and the other person done this you're talking about manifestations you're not talking about the birth wait till we get to it maybe this afternoon I doubt maybe this afternoon but let me just say this point to you have you ever thought about that you know a dog when it's mourned we know it doesn't have a soul but it has a spirit and you know that dog comes into the world barking or whatever you want to call it whining crying whatever you want to call it you ever notice a baby comes into the world and it can cry it can make sounds but you know it can't talk now what's wrong is God every product right but it can't talk it must learn to talk you can you don't consider that you wouldn't consider that in relation to the new birth maybe we need to think things over and consider and as I've said over and over to you I would to God that I could preach that every one of us in this building would find out we were lost that would be my goal then we could do something about it but I realize most people are never going to admit they're lost so if you don't admit your loss you can't be saved that's that's just truth right so if I were you and me and all of us I'd consider a lot of things and listen to the word of God so if the new birth is a birth of the word it's the word Made Alive In You by the holy spirit that comes down and irrigates or strikes or anoints whatever the wordings you want to use that word that you have held and it comes alive there was the disciples as we'll read in a minute even after their understanding was opened to Jesus and the things they were not born again well see then you say well I've got a knowledge well let's say knowledge is wonderful but what have we been emphasizing lately that the prophet emphasized what you can only be saved by revelation has God revealed himself to you personally to you or you're still just thinking I cried I spoke in tongues I done this that or the other you see we need to wake up to that point and think about it he said oh brother Dale what did he reveal to you he began to open this message to me once I received that new birth it began to just unfold into a greater manner or thoughts and it's not stopped now if it stops somewhere along the way it's good sensible knowledge to know you didn't have it it was ever been had knowledge all right do you see the people of the message now that's running writing left is falling out and leaving after 40 Years of preaching it well you know that's between them and God this is between me and you and God what we do here all right but now think about it the birth of the word and then as we covered you know and we covered the last message how that we get the new birth here at Faith that's the birth of the word that's Faith revelation then each one of these is being born again a birth means a coming forth into like a baby comes forth into the world it's a birth and and see you come forth into virtue into knowledge into Tempest patience godliness Etc all right then it'll come forth Into The Headstone which is love and when that is then the individual is then as a prophet would call it statue of a perfect man sealed in not meaning that you're not sealed in you're sealed in by the new birth that faith because that is the holy spirit but it's the holy spirit all the way up to pyramid to bring us out to a birth of the message of the hour from According to as a prophet would call it Malachi 4. a new birth well you think we need a new birth we need a new birth every day every day they received a refilling in the book of Acts right there's one birth but they received a filling when they would meet they would receive a refilling of the Holy Ghost that didn't mean they didn't have anything it meant they did have something if you get a refilling because if you don't have it you can't go to refilling right because that simply means to be filled first and then refilling means to refill but if you you don't have anything it's not a refilling all right it's trying to make points to us to think about ourselves and consider where we're at see all right now if you watch what we're approaching today you will see more and more as we keep speaking about the birth of the word and you'll see why the new birth is that birth of the word all right but then it doesn't stop see it keeps climbing all the way up until we leave out of here all right Being Born Again by The Incorruptible word of God all right now let's take the thought from where we've read here in the scripture and we read here in John that after the resurrection so Judas wouldn't president you can't put him into this after the resurrection after the assembling you know the part of of Mary and them and the going and you know and the doings and the Gathering dinner disciples not in the upper room now this is just a gathering time that they had that they were gathered there because they were all worried and wondering what was going on and they kind of was together and and and when he did Jesus just appeared among them all right and as he did he done something marvelous he said when he had said this he breathed on them after he had said even as a father that sent me you know I send you all right now we know the story of that how was it the father sent the son not a second person somebody sent like we want the word sent who was it God himself came down and went all right so how did he send him God came down and went in him all right how does he send you and I he comes down and goes in US all right now but he said and breathed on him and said receive ye the Holy Ghost now did they get it right there right now over in uh where is it um John 7 it talks about when he would sit out of your belly shall rule liver rivers of Living Water did this fake he of the Holy Ghost that had not been given because Jesus had not been glorified all right now here he's glorified right all right he's went through his glorification and he speaks to him did they receive it right there all right now we know the message you know that's not true he didn't receive it to her because that's what the prophet said about it right so let's make sure that there are other internet people can do it and we can read it again here go ahead with number one Brothers on on questions and answers preached in uh 64 I guess it is or 60. go ahead with number one 1964. paragraph 60 and they asked him the question brother Branham what is the difference between what is the difference when Jesus breathed on a disciple and said receive ye the Holy Ghost and when they had to go to the upper room deterior what's the difference he said all right it was a promise he gave them breathed upon them his promise said receive ye the Holy Ghost it was a promise they went to the upper room to wait for the promise to be fulfilled all right so even after his resurrection and even after his glorification and even after his appearing he breathed on them and said receive you the Holy Ghost but it did not come at that time because it was a promise all right aren't we glad we got a prophet to be able to read and that way well I think it means this well Fooly were your thoughts and mine too I think it's time to get away from our thoughts to get down to the message but watch it very carefully now and look at number two now which is taken from the message it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness and look what the prophet has to say about this speaking of this same thing they know that his word that was that he was to send back the Holy Ghost they knowed that was a promise they know that they had to wait up there for it now we're going to read the scriptures to where you're related together they had seen him they knowed he was dead they note he was risen they had seen him therefore they knowed what they were talking about what that they must go and wait right all right so now when it says in John then that when he said he said this he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost all right they didn't receive it right then they had to go to the upper room right now let's get this on another time the Lord is explaining it so go ahead with number four bypass 3 because we've read that go to number four Luke 24. and 45. and I want you to think about something this is the same event you know not the same placing Maybe but look at this event as the same thing you would look at the other to where that it was a promise of the Holy Ghost to come now here's where he's giving that promise in his message as he's coming forth you know bringing the message then watch what it said now then open he their understanding no you remember the two disciples on the road to Emmaus he opened their understanding of the word well when he comes back with the disciples he opens their understanding of the word brother Dale always understanding was was a revelation you're running close to a point but you're not close enough it can be your head knowledge that is opened remember the the the little woman there that touched His Garment brother Brown and said she had faith far the time which means she didn't have Holy Ghost Field Born Again experience of faith she had it for that time there amen and if you annihilate this scriptures look where the trouble you're going to because you'll have all of it you know that Moses did not have the baptism with the Holy Ghost right but yet his understanding was opened unto him until he wrote the first five books of the Bible even what happened in Genesis and all of the things he wrote them from the opening of his understanding or what God revealed to him you can get a revelation without the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it'll be a revelation it will not bring you a new birth just because you do it it didn't bring Moses a new birth about what was dark right now come on think about what we're saying I try to lay it out that way where that it ties together all the scriptures to where you won't just think in some idea so look then open either understanding what that they might understand the scriptures after three and a half years he finally opens her understanding after the resurrection does that give them the new birth no because it tells you down here in a minute right and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoove Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day remember they didn't know that even after all the years of hearing the Lord Jesus talk about it right they still didn't know it so we opened their understanding of what he had said to them and said in other words it's not written here it is that but if he opened her understanding he said look I've tried for three and a half years to explain what I come into the world for I've come into the world to die I had to do it this way it had to be done this way you didn't understand it you still don't understand it the way you need to understand because come on over in the book of Acts after even his Ascension they were still talking about are you going to restore the Kingdom of Israel at this time they still had their mind on something Earthly all right now there's no hopes in Earthly things so he had to open their understanding of what he had taught to them he didn't say reveal it like totally but he opened it that he was the one they were speaking of when he went down in his descending to the spirits in prison he opened their understanding that he was the woman said that had come and was crucified he done it twice there don't just tie it to one he went to the people that could not be saved open their understanding as a witness against them right to show who he was he also came by and picked up the Old Testament Saints and opened their understanding of who he was one because they didn't know he went away all right watch and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and you're Witnesses of these things and behold I send the promise of my father what upon you know same thing as he done in John when he breathed on him and said receive ye the Holy Ghost but what she stipulates but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endured with power from online now this is all right I'm opening your understanding I'm showing you who I am I'm letting you know things that the world knows nothing about but go to the upper room all right so when brother Brown said it was a promise he was exactly scriptural because it was a promise that what when the Holy Ghost comes he'll open could you go over into John Diaries and then John where he talks about to comforter become and what it would do and brain to you remembers whatsoever I said and even teach you things to come are we still in the scripture all right but you see then it's a promise it's a promise that they would receive the Holy Ghost but then he stipulated he didn't say go down in Jericho go out on the River Jordan go down there and walk around where you've been where'd he say tear you in the city of Jerusalem a place for pirate all right now you know what they were doing then they kind of was in the upper room we think about it as being some kind of doing but really it's the best thing to think of it's my way of thinking about it to make it fit all of it they were up in an attic probably as far as they could go because they were told to go wait and we'll get to that in a minute where yeah let's go ahead let's go ahead with number six I passed five because that's where he says for them in the in the book of Acts one in six but we want to go here and look what the prophet says now come down you know this took place this is presuming he told us to wait up here until we had received the promise of the father and we was going to receive the Holy Ghost you remember he raised his hands upon us and breathed upon us and said receive ye the Holy Ghost yeah well I'll tell you brethren I believe we got her I presume we've got it right oh you miserable hypocrite yeah like pretty hard see I believe we got it I think word accepted by faith you know all of these and the stories behind all of them did he used in this illustration a lot of time and they'll say we we've got it let's go out by faith we've seen the dead raised we've seen this hill we've seen all of this let's just take it by faith that's a good way of talking because it sounds like a lot of us right yeah but watch I presume we got it I think we ought to be to accept it you Baptists we're accepted by faith by faith nothing it's an experience well they were in the upper room they were all gathered they were all doing they were doing exactly what Jesus said they were tiring well why didn't it well let's just take it by faith let's just right now just take it are you listening or are you texting I tell you brethren I believe we got it we got it well brother Dale I believe it by faith I believe got the Holy Ghost what's the difference back dire and now what's the difference what's the difference in the people that were back there and the people today by faith you know you got to do that that's good you know they were in the upper room they were doing good they with our things was happening you know the prophet said there's no Firestone eight days or something you know he said one of them said well I believe we got it let's go but one of them had enough knowledge to say we evidently don't have what he had now you know why because he wouldn't have been in the upper room hiding right they were scared to death sitting in the upper room hiding right the big one it jumped up and said I believe we got her if I'd have been there I said going out the door let's see what happens to you yeah because I don't believe I got it I won't wait here but you go on out we'll view through the door and see what happens to you because you know about that time they were hunting for him trying to find them and everything else but you see we can oh but we got it by faith we just take it by faith which is it's by faith faith is revelation ain't it brother Dale yeah but what is that revelation now you tell me now we're going to make an illustration out of this after coming into the message and unbean it might have been a time that God went to the ignorance back behind but uh it's time to repent you mean after you come in the message you've been in the message a while and then you're just going to tell me you're going to take it by faith when as much as you've heard of the Prophet say and as much as I've tried to preach about it it's got to be an experience it's got to be a revelation well now what's God revealed to you see that's why folks I'd rather have my experience than anybody's experience in the world now you don't like that that's all right you know why because I live through mine because that's what an experience means something you live through I know the quotes where the Prophet said to receive the baptism in the Holy Ghost without a sensation I know that quote I think it's uh Blasphemous names or statue of perfect man I'm sorry there's a lot of difference in experience and sensation well I I've never got a revelation brother that well then you're not born again yeah but I believe everything the Bible said I believe everything the prophet said great it's all laying down waiting on the Holy Ghost to make it alive I read six books listened to two tapes I could do that in a day because I had a wonderful job I've done that for two years before I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost remember the disciples had pretty good faith they were with him after his resurrection but remember also that Faith didn't hold too good because they wasn't coming out of that Upper Room but when the Holy Ghost came out to win right they had when the Holy Ghost came what he had before then they had a mental conception of the word call it faith if you like it had been open to them who Jesus Christ was hey come on you remember over to Apollos you remember over in the book of Acts Paul gets over and said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe you remember that you remember what they were they were Believers in Jesus Christ read the book of Acts read your Prophet those that Apollos was talking to were Believers in Jesus Christ they were teaching by the scriptures that he was the Christ read the book of Acts but see they didn't know he'd even died they didn't know he had died and Resurrected read your Bible so Paul explains to him and when he does then the Holy Ghost falls on him then they had an experience or a revelation now what I mean by Revelation I don't mean that you've got to say well I just got this great Revelation I believe I got to New Birth well remember it might be that or it might be your understanding open which one is it if it's Revelation you're willing to stand before the world and Proclaim your Revelation put it on internet and announce to the world show me something contrary than what I've taught for 50 years almost of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in what the New Birth really is the birth of the word and as the prophet said a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you watch him now but yeah but how do you get these big Revelations would you explain to me in the Christ of mystery where he's just explained what the new birth is it's a revelation personally to you about Jesus Christ and he said the most illiterate person that's right could be born again now get it out of your mind then all about this or brother you're talking about so many great Revelation you have to have this Revelation and that revelation God have this revelation God the most illiterate person now come on if it's the most illiterate person it's not no great big thing right but remember the other day what little bit God reveals you is a great big thing right if it's one word it's a great thing the most illiterate person could receive that Jesus Christ died for their sins that's Bible open to that person and they can be born again by that what's the matter with us I try to bring something out to you and all it runs into is something you think we've got to have this great intellect we've got to have then well come on we've been around you long enough why don't we want to intellect right why do you not want to know about God even it's just intellectual I thought we were bro here to as children of God to study about God I didn't know it was to study about the world and the Affairs and the things I thought it was to study God's word listen have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed after coming in this message and believing it he received the Holy Ghost called Remember of what I taught you're born again at Faith I don't care who you are Prophet priest king brother Brown was born again at Faith all right just because he was a prophet didn't put him up here he had to grow in Grace and knowledge even the Lord Jesus groaned in Grace and knowledge all right so if you're born again at Faith wonderful but then we got to grow upward in him I'll listen the other day to my own message thinking about thinking where brother Brown said Paul stayed with his convert and I thought Lord that's a good point I'm glad I made it you remember the other day Paul if he got his convert born again he stayed with him and taught him the virtues if he didn't get borned again when he first started he stayed with him until he got born again then he could teach him the virtues I thought Lord thank you for that but listen can you see that when he breathed on them that it was not the new birth but yet putting to others with Luke it would be an opening of the scriptures of their understanding of who he was and what he done and what had happened but then he would still tell them you got to go to the upper room and wait what do you think about that brother Dale I've never heard nothing the way you talk you talk about the New Birth is a revelation will you tell me what it is that's what your Prophet said now you tell me what it is of some other way whenever one of us is different I don't have nothing to do with it every one of us was born somewhere might have been at home might have been a hospital might have been a pig pen might have been anything but a birth is a mess and every one of us come what water blood and life and even if you want to go with the cesareans you're still going to get water and blood and life so then all new births no matter what age you're in did I give it to you where the Prophet said the Holy Ghost was in every age did I give it to him where he said everybody had the same experience what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word right that was so mistought until he had it as love and thanks and he said the Holy Spirit straightened him out in a vision see it had to do with receiving the word do you see what's wrong with the people of the message today why they're just falling away churches people preachers the worst of all it's just falling away what's the matter because they can't stay in the word you mean to tell me that the Holy Ghost is will differ with the word that's right you see why I'm not afraid to tell the internet world what I believe because I got scripture I've got the quotes of the Prophet I've got 40 Years of preaching it you think I'm afraid for somebody to some ignorant ignoramus come along to try to convince me that the new birth is something different you say well you shouldn't talk that away will I try not to be too nasty I could say it a whole lot worse I tried to get away from that dumb and stupid stuff you know that Josiah got on to me about years ago let me saying I've tried but I still remember what brother Brown said he said if you make it easy they'll think you try and pull something over on them who said if you make it hard that at least don't think you're trying to pull something over on them at least you know where I stand but you know where I stood for 40 something years behind this Pulpit declaring the new birth and still today declaring and that birth is unfolding today more than it ever has in my life because it's tying together with all of the scriptures and the things that the prophet has taught and I don't have to deny anything he says but still get back to my point now because I want you he breathed upon him and said receive ye the Holy Ghost now that's a promise right all right now you would you like to hear that promise again in the Bible to another group of people the same promise that you're going to have to wait you're going to have to do this you're going to have to do that it's going to this is going to happen the understanding is going to be open and then the Holy Ghost is going to come how about it go ahead brother with Ezekiel I was going to read this scripture and start with and we still may use it this evening but I'd like for you to think about these things and that first of all I would like for you to listen to uh restoration of the Bride tree because in that restoration of the Bride tree brother random covers four messengers of death to destroy the tree and four messengers of life now you've got to be real careful because remember life comes in the third stage and that's what we're getting to what we're talking about but in that in restoration life comes in the fourth stage so let's get what is going on and read it so Ezekiel 37 he said again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh you dry bones hear the word of the Lord now who is this this is Ezekiel to Israel right Ezekiel to Israel right now what do we get to that in a minute for this evening one of the two thus saith the Lord this is what he's to say he said unto me prophesy all right thus saith the Lord unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live now remember this is God telling him what to do down here he'll tell how it happened okay follow it watch and I should call breaths cause breath to enter into you and you shall live and I'll lay seniors upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord the same four stages that goes with the restoration of the Bride tree four bugs eat it down four brings it back justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the word right so read restoration the bride tree and listen to what I'm talking about so that's what he said now cause breath to enter into you and you shall live now watch him I lay sin you number one upon you and bring flesh upon you number two and cover your skin number three but deflection is getting on if you don't believe that bring up here I'll whack it and you can look inside and you'll find a some skin some flesh inside and some skin outside right oh well it's all just can but look that still don't do it it says and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord that's the promise to Israel of restoration after we leave out of here right They will receive this message not from Brother Branham and not from the bride as people want to make it they'll receive it from the two prophets which are Jews according to the prophet because they won't hear nobody else but Jews so don't get no Gentiles involved this is going to Israel even I got a little sense Elijah was a gentile but when this Prophet comes in the end time he ain't gonna be no Gentile this Prophet to you and I as a gentile but to profit to them is going to be a Jew brother Brown said two Jews I had that out a long time ago with the people I think we're going to stay why are we not going to stay what brother Brown said well I think maybe you don't think brother that's what a man told me sitting across the table up at blew more of what it was in Gainesville oh eating place he said you don't think that could be a gentile prophet and a gentile bride I knew immediately that who he was talking about you know who he's talking about wouldn't brother Brandon he was talking about himself and a gentile bride I looked across the table I said quote page number of the seal book brother Brown said it would be two Jews well he didn't talk to me no more because I was an illiterate I was a you know an underdog that had no Revelation well I still stay with the prophet you know okay but now look I'll they send you upon you I'll bring up flesh upon you cover your skin and then I'll breathe in you the four stages justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the word same thing all right watch roll it up just a little bit now remember this is what God told him to do okay and told him what would happen now watch it so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold the shaken and the bones came together bone to his bone you remember that song Dem Bones Them Bones them dry bones and when I be held low the sinews and the flesh Came Upon them and the skin covered them above then word over it top fixing it but there was no breath in them that's what your Bible says then said he unto me prophesying how does the breath come on I want to say a little bit on backup I ain't gonna say a whole lot now this is a seed when Jesus breathed on them and I know the message I've looked up a lot of things so don't worry about it you just listen did Jesus go receive ye the Holy Ghost or did he say receive ye the Holy Ghost you remember I said something the other day and I told you to go home and try it how many went home and tried it I've told you I wasn't going to do it here if we're going to be going to be embarrassing and so maybe we wouldn't want to do it but you remember what I told you the other day I said turn around take a possession back part of your hand cut a filter and and just talk to the back part of your hand and you feel are coming out right amen the same hours coming out as it would if you went which one took place back there and which one's going to take place to Israel sure he breathed but his breath was the word of God amen think on that a little bit don't blow it off it's some thing something brother Dale thought of because I woke up in the middle of the night breathing on the back of my hand and I started weeping I was just breathing but the back of my hand was feeling it I ask you the question while ago when we started the puppy dog can whine when it's born and it never learns to talk yet they can train them in time so they said something to that they even say words right but the baby comes into the world crying it's the same way the dog was whining but then the baby learn us to talk right what makes it words that I'm saying automatically I must breathe right and I'm breathing out not breathing in now I can breathe in and out while I'm talking so that's not no worry all right but when you're speaking air is going across your vocal cords now you explain to me how that works why did this not make a sound when I go the air is going across the same vocal cords but yet I turn around and I don't have to go let me build it up hey folks I just start saying words but you know I'm saying words the dog can't say oh yeah they can train them come on we'll get off of it too you know they don't have a soul and they're not dealing with that who's speaking when it comes out as words remember as it is the fact that you don't see with your eyes right come on you don't see with your eyes right come on medically speaking you don't see it with your eyes you see from that inner being that you are see that inner being that you are is what speaks words all right they may not mean a thing to you but we'll get a little more maybe it might turn around and do something I think this Israel they'll be standing one day they'll they're in their lands now and they'll begin to hear the message and they'll begin to see that Jesus Christ 144 000 not all of them and they'll begin to see that Jesus Christ is almighty God but they still need one more thing their eyes can be old he did to the disciples but they're still needed the baptism of the Holy Ghost Watch what it says then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the Lord God come from the Four Winds o breath and breathe upon the slain that they may live well tell the wind to come blowing you're coming here's a wind blow to cry are you listening when he done what he was told to do life comes into Israel watch him so I prophesied he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet and exceeding great Army same identical thing that was existing with the disciples when the Lord Jesus met him or had them there and said receive ye the Holy Ghost as I said was it necessarily him blowing or was it what he said because either way the Irish coming out either way it's her he had to speak our being in the presence I thought we believed in spiritual multiplication I thought we believed it was necessary for a preacher to preach whether you like the object that's speaking to you or whether you care or that's between you and God listen to the dumb donkey he'll help you what I am is between me and God not you and God you just listen to the words if I die and go to hell that don't mean you've got to follow me that means you listen to what say it because I'm going to say it whether you like it or not because you're not going to get it without somebody speaking it to you go do what you want to I'll read myself go ahead women I've been through this I've been it with sisters and things that said we don't need a preacher but anytime they had a baby to be dedicated they wanted to call me and when they had somebody was sick they wanted to call me and they wanted weddings done they wanted to call me but they didn't need no preacher and I was nice and I went and done what they asked but you see it don't make me nothing we're back up doing this this evening a little bit to get it but now remember who was doing the talking said Son of Man prophesy you see folks this message came in the end time from a man's lips the word of almighty God came from a man's lips the Lord Jesus had to say what he said or they would have never been a New Birth come into being he preached to him for three and a half years breathing on them speaking his words coming from his vocal cords coming from that inside man that's inside of him that we call a soul who's speaking today a soul what you see Jesus had to speak them into existence he had to speak their birth into a place that they could receive it it received that new birth and it was what the birth of the word did he have to well that ain't working I'm not arguing with you if you want to say he did that ain't got nothing to do with it now you ain't even listening you're just arguing whether he did do that I got word of prophet said he breathed on well Glory Hallelujah so have I would have also got the entire Bible to back up what took place and we'll take place to Israel that the Lord Jesus stood there after all the opening of their understanding after all the things he had done after his resurrection and he breathed on them disciples and said receive ye the Holy Ghost but he was telling them the same thing Luke said he was telling him all right you got it you open the word it's here now go to the upper room and wait until the Holy Ghost comes Israel is in their Homeland it's a mighty nation all we got to do is get out of here as a gentile bride and God goes to Israel and you know what they go through the same experience you and I have the only difference is they'll never be bride they just come up as servants even though they go through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the opening of the word do you see why it takes a prophet you see why Prophet had to come because who was going to speak to this Gentile dispensation the Lord Jesus spoke back there which was basically to the Jews right now about the opening of the door of the Gentiles to Peter that still didn't bring it all in did it because remember your Shadrach Meshach and Abednego to make it tonight you worry about putting the names our but he appeared to Israel he appeared to the Samaritans which was Hive to you in high Gentile but he never appeared to the Gentiles as in his life to do they came in to where he was at yeah and they touched His Garment and they heard the word but yet he told them he said this is not for you he had to wait until the Peter opened the door to the Gentiles and then when the door was opened to the Gentiles you know we were able to come in didn't it become a gentile dispensation but in that Gentile dispensation there was never a manifestation of God to the Gentiles other than opening the door the Messiah never came he came to the Jews came to his own his own received and not as many as receiving gave you power to become the sons of God is that Bible that he went to the Samaritans which was the woman at the well yep but he never went to the Gentiles in an Earthly Ministry so he had to come in the end time through a prophet what do you think I'm talking about Ezekiel is the one that spoke life into Israel when he speaks to Israel in the end times it'll be the word of God and it'll bring life to them well you thanks had been taking place all of these 40-something years that we've heard the message of the hour you don't listen to those tapes as being the voice of God well I'm listening see what is right or wrong I caught him that caught him wrong he he said something other day is wrong Glory Hallelujah for your little Petey Patty but you see why Church sometimes you walk alone with what you believe but don't you see what this Prophet has done we'll pick it up this evening look what he done look what he's still doing people are still receiving this message right why would it be called in the days of the what days of the voice of the seventh angel I thought we believe that the new birth came through the body right I thought somebody had to plant a seed for the new birth to be able to take place that's what I thought you see what a preacher is supposed to be doing then but oh I can just see people if you stand up there and you talk and you preach and you pour out your heart and you talk about born by the Breath of God as we'll get to more this evening and you talk about brother Branham and I think and then one day it'll quick unto you maybe when you're there listening and you'll say you know that's what God's been doing he's been breathing on us his word well how can we hear without a preacher now can he preach unless he be sent that's all right go ahead get it on your own do on your own if the prophet had not come they would not have been a gentile bride in the last days because he had to speak her into existence right the Lord Jesus literally spoke us into existence when he breathed and said receive ye the Holy Ghost he literally spoke the entire bride into existence right right but the thing of it was it had to come to a gentile prophet in the last days because you would have to have your Valley of the dry bones to be topping the bride of Christ and they had seen you that skin a flesh and that skin and in the head life the four stages of the bug that ate us down canker worm Palm worm Locus and caterpillar by the Breath of God in his word he has promised us that will be restored and he's already come through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the word is here spoken by the end time prophet actually that way I put all my confidence in whether or not he was the right man because if he wasn't the right man we better find somebody that's got a message we ain't got long we better be hunting a message well I'm going out here I'm going to try they'll told me to I'm gonna go see who's got shines and wonders I didn't say that that's anointing find out who's got the message thank you you see that's why I've never been one to try to make people or try to convince them to come to this church and I never tried to run nobody off I've always left it up to every individual to make up your own mind and to decide whether or not it's word yeah but brother Dale I just feel so much better when other preaching I do too I love to sit down to a good meal of beans and taters and things you know just tell me a good time but you know a lot of times I just like to go down to old Outback or you know Steakhouse sit down and get me a steak and I can't get them at Roadhouse when I want them because they only serve them Friday afternoon after four o'clock and you can get them Saturday I love the what is the snake it's the one you can't get uh prime rib I love a prime rib and I just have me a jubilee eating that prime rib I don't need no vacator I don't need nothing and don't need no sauce to put on it I just have me a good time I like to hear simple messages it always keeps reminding me of myself and I'd like to hear something that I can eat and let it Digest and it can be part of the word I'll get around to it when I get to it because you read Masterpiece if you get a chance see not out with a shook random covers those four stages and he covered it in the bases of ranking it and he said that Pentecost Azusa Street Pentecost that Mary represented that he said see there he said Mary was not deceived she was a carrier that he said somebody's got to be the work well why don't we strive for that come on brother why don't we strive for that listen why stay with the promise when we can move in to the revealed word but yet all we want to do stay well I got the promises I got the problem but what does it mean I believe the word I love that word but I just it's president I just have trouble understanding you because you're just always seem to be talking about things I don't know nothing about why is it you don't know nothing about him I mean I've been what five ten sermons on the birth of the hurt and that's so deep until they can't you don't understand it I don't understand it this time but I believe it 120 in the red 120 in red book anybody have a need we'll try to pick our thought off this evening going into the message bring me every bird unto me come and trust my mind are you disappointed why bring your kids to Jesus peace unto me and I die you're dismissed remember the services his greatest foreign
