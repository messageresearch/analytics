you to just touch the bodies you said you would send your word and heal us so we believe you got us all most of all forgive our sins and keep us completing you in Jesus name Amen go to Hebrews and we could just save reading a lot and all but you know let's go we're about verse 37 it says talking about how they were stones on the sundered tempted were slain with the sword all the Old Testament Saints everybody understand this this is the Old Testament Saints it's speaking of them and the things that happen to them in their lives and time all right of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains and in dens and caves of the earth these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise something was withholding our didn't come at that time all right God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word we I had a good time yesterday and enjoyed it and everything they were even the ladies they told me how much they appreciated doing the things you know and all for us to just have a good time cause they could at least end back life a little bit with us and in the situations and all and we just enjoyed it you know right now I've been quite a bit on this this makes number four work yes message on that god is waiting on us and we think all the time that we're waiting on God well that's true and that's the human items we are people and we're supposed to be dependent upon him and wait on him to guide us into life but it it's like the the Prophet came over there you know and he he he told him said to Moses don't cry at all to speak it well it's always been that God wants us to take upon our own lips take up on our own being of what we are and in things and speak the word and move forward oh that's that's them Kamiya it's been my goal is to see a church you know that would believe God's Word and be able to anchor into that word enough to you know bypass all of this old life and times internet forth into what God has really designed and whatever all right but I'm trying to get a little point in and I want to get that in another thing I made a couple of statements the other day I've got to clarify late but I'll do it later I won't do it but the statements was writings and it was just West you misunderstood but anyhow well we'll get that straight cuz we just want to do today is to try to bring this point to an end why and for what for him if opinion what for what ungodly Rives them do you think that it would be the gods waiting on me and you you know I mean that may not seem strange to you I mean I mean we can to comprehend you don't understand waiting on God that's that's the point you know for him to come on the scene and do this and do that and that's true now let's see really God is waiting on me and you to be able to step out move on in him and to get away from ourselves and just walk in the light of the love of God all right now I've tried to get you to think about it because you know the Lord spoke to me about the point and to showing me what what is me meant by they without us there in Hebrews cannot be made perfect now we can go through the lineup of everything just to try to cover everybody that word perfect there does not mean that there's some kind of perfection or or you know you need to wash a little bit more a buff a little bit more do this out of the other now it's simply explaining a situation that I believe see by that that it's meaning to you and I it's in the end time what would be you know we go to a movie we watch it and it finishes you know and then it says the end it's always got a big scene that the whole story for an hour and a half of the movie is building a thing in your mind for you to think on but then all it wants it to end it this comes up and John and happy John and Mary lived happily ever after it comes to a point but remember that point is the reason for the whole story you know we thought what they well they just go right now through the you know the sunset sometimes well that whole movie is built for that see if you said well we'll sum up the sum up the movie you know to us in this then you just say John and happened John and Ray lived happily ever after see that would be the point but we wouldn't just do it that way but that would be the point right if you said well well you know give me the story and you give them page one and then say John will you to know who Johnny is and what's happening and that the whole story is to get you to get those two people together but to finish with the final scene of the movie alright natural way of expressing it see because I believe that that's the same thing as the spiritual is happening that God has waited to the last to finish it up alright we're down at the end of the book at the end of the story we'll come on folks we ought to be after all of these years waiting in this happening and that happening but then we find out God was waiting on us well alright let's wake up to the point of what we have to do with the story see the story is about John and Mary right I mean you make a move you know it's about them it's not about the author it's not about all the other thing it's about them we'll see then here's the whole Bible the entire Bible is to be summed up in the end time by a people becoming what God wanted him to be and he can come on the scene and make manifest his word you said well I don't think it'll ever happen alright so if you don't we go down and go but a great I mean we've got a choice this is the end time is not a time element running out of clock goes tick tick tick you know now this is not that this is the finishing up of all time and I'm as seriously as I can be I'm putting it here in three messages fourth one now to say God is waiting on you and I to wake up from our petty little talks and well we don't believe this but we don't see this what are you talking about you don't see I mean is your heart still beating that's a miracle right I mean what are we looking for miracles what I just don't see God doing things all right maybe we ought to wake up to that you know and see it around the world today there's great manifestations of God around the world every day and see then that's that's what we need but that's what the Lord showed me now here's the whole point in a nutshell whatever God started with that's the way he's going to finish right so if he started with John and Mary he's not gonna change situations and the story and come out and how two or three more people involved know he's going to end the story with John and Mary alright now that's the way I believe the Bible I believe the entire Bible is to be finalized finished brought into being now we're talking about two Gentile dispensation we know don't just say well hey don't we know that we're not going beyond to the the fields you we're not going on out to the Jews and the redemption of Israel we're talking about our Redemption are you with me see our Redemption because it's all dependent in there odd that he puts us right in the place to where the end of all of it would be he chose us for a Pacific purpose okay you said well what's my purpose and brother Dale I'm here to be the word and believe the word to just believe it and accept it how you gonna get your healing leave the word confess it with your mouth and let it be made manifest how are you gonna get your salvation believe in the word confessing the word walk into it all right how is there gonna be a change of the body somebody's going to catch it and they're going to walk into it all right now we then will have our right of choice to be able to volunteer for it or we can be this time can just keep running on for us but somebody somewhere is going to catch it and move into it I contend this up so let's believe it why would you read the Bible for somebody else come on now if you want to just stay a while on that that's what we've done the Baptist that's what I used to kind of believe it was for everybody else wooden for me but then I began to hate wait a minute this this Bible is talking to me then when I heard the endtime message see then I really saw what it was talking about impulses day without us could not be made perfect okay so that word perfect means to be complete or to finish up it has nothing to do with the bodily perfections you know anything in the rims of those things it has to do with the fact of us believing God's Word and walking right into it all right now so what was our thought centered on whatever God starts with God's original creation if you'll notice in the Bible see Adam was a grown man there wasn't a baby and grown up then their disciples the disciples was not babies grown men in the gospel so every bit of God's creation anywhere he starts a beginning of a creation in the way he wants it it always start with a full-grown all right there Adam in the garden was full-grown he was a human being created of God made in the image of God and made for a specific purpose to be God's plan and purpose best thing to say and God put into Adam what he wants ever son to be that's why it's so important to follow the prophets message because there was no way we could find it anywhere else see nobody else knows anything about Adam being and having eternal life in his soul the biggest portion of this message don't know it they don't think on it they don't study on it and you say well Adam had eternal life in his soul I don't know worry didn't know I don't know you know I don't everybody all of these brothers drink their water - cause it would dry well forgive me my mouth is just it's been four weeks now just dried out and alright but now listen so what did he start with he didn't start with a baby in the garden now he could have done that right he could have put Adam and Eve with all cuz of all the other animals see they were created full-grown I believe but then they started multiplying well I believe that you and I I mean mankind what started off would have been Adam with eternal life brother Branham says in blasphemous names especially into Adam the breath of eternal life to make him an eternal person with God I now do we believe that now it didn't take the new birth to bring that man into being he wouldn't birth as a baby Hindu all enough he was spoken into existence to be the beginning of a natural human creation and put in that what he wants ever son in that creation and daughter to be all right so then he put eternal out now if you won't teach them you just read it right around cents book god off the blasting minutes night especially upon Adam now either running any computers you're gonna run in special don't run in you know don't try to just run it in special way brother runs but God's put see feet clean let me put that in in the correct order a phone Adam breathed the breath of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God he had powerful like God he was an amateur God all right what was God doing making his first son and putting him in charge of the world right the earth and things his son all right and that's what he won't sit to be in me and you all right now when he started at him and put him there he put in there perfect you agree because God cannot create anything imperfect so when he created Adam he was perfect in body spirit and soul as a man this has to be what God wanted and he was there rent in the garden to do those things he put the 126 man if you wanted by do a background part he put to 126 man into the to seven I think is what it is where he created natural Adam and he puts it there in the you know to come forth all right that's why he would be called then the first Adam well now he's called the first Adam concrete now he was called the first Adam because he was created way God wanted him you know if you listen to that thought you'll see more about it it'd be more interesting to you to think about Adam his being what God wanted was right there all right now why did God not make the body and spirit of Adam eternal they made his soul eternal which was an impartation of his own life right why did he not make the body and spirit eternal because there was no way that they could have ever fallen if he ed eternal life in body spirit and soul there would have been no fall all right but yet leaving him like he was made him perfect to the point but yet God knowing what Adam would do so he just gives me everything ready you know everything is right in order and here comes the beast here comes the thing here comes ease now come on you get what brother branham on back to the eve and you'll find she had eternal life into her soul she did now what's you out you won't try to make her one thing in him another no she was the same thing as him Adam and Eve were the same all right now then in doing that then you see that they were made not to on they were not made to fall you know what I mean they wouldn't made default but they were made in the position they were in to where they could fall are you following me see Adam even though he had eternal life in his so he could still be tempted and tried well I don't know where that well then what about you don't you have eternal life in your soul by the new birth well you don't have no problems you don't you don't have no troubles well I'll be glad what we anytime you don't do that you know I have a battle and all this stuff but now listen to see he couldn't he didn't make Adam eternal life yNN's body spirit and soul he made him eternal in his soul all right knowing then that the fall would come that he would do what she would do Adam would do what he would do and it would bring the human race into that position but he knew that would bring forward all of his attributes right now are you with me that would bring his attributes so he didn't make them wrong he made them perfect he didn't make a sinner no he made a person a human being because that would be his design down here now as I said keep watching Adam if you'll take Adam from that you'll see I could name the animals how all the things could take place and all I kept because he was God of the earth all right now so water which is supposed to be all right now but see that put then a thing in line that God could display his attributes okay we see the fall and we see the the things happening down through we see in the Old Testament they were mighty marvelous situations took place great experiences those people had but yet we see that in that Old Testament they did not come forth with eternal life in their soul they just become a living soul good after the fall how could you bring anything all right now then see all of that would be waiting all that Old Testament was waiting there was nobody in the Old Testament had eternal life but Adam Jesus comes as the keystone between the old and the new putting it all together into one thing and as he does then Jesus Christ who Almighty God in human flesh here comes the second Adam the first Adam was was a natural human being but not just in a natural totally he was he had eternal life in his soul all right but yet he needed to get to that tree now you understand what I'm saying that God made everything so perfect everything's right in order the Tree of Life was right there they could have went to the Tree of Life right and it would have made their bodies eternal he said well how do you know that this Bible is the Word of God this Bible is the tree of life what is happening all we got to do is just read that Bible and we're protectors of eternal life in the natural no no I'm not saying you read it into something great eternal I'm just using the illustration okay now so that for I was kind of picking up the little different ones and you know new ones today not leaving them behind on us that Jesus Christ then was God's full example child but yet it was just a second Adam right I mean that's what he was what was Jesus then Jesus was a human being God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself remember the Bible calls him the man Christ Jesus so that Jesus comes forth and he's a natural he's first he's a beginning of the creation of the spiritual Adam you know all right which would be the new birth to us but now to him he came forth into eternal life that was little Jehovah crying in the cradle that was Almighty God laying there playing in the cradle because he was a human being now here's worth then I'll explain it back when I dropped back for it but I still want you to follow the point or thought because this is the way I've always touted there Jesus was body a man name is Adam spirit and soul the same as Adam made him a man alright now we'll get into the division don't worry about it I studied a little bit I know that that spirit in Jesus was a spirit in in divers manners Roldan I know all I know the scripture yet we will get back to that later in a natural point my point is I'm wanting you to see whatever that man Adam international needed are doing it what happened you start the Bible if you look it's a beautiful picture to me you start the Bible with a full-grown child of God a son of God Adam was a son of God not just a physical creation he was the son of God that eternal life was dwelling within his soul uh-huh then when Jesus comes he he was Almighty God eternal life dwelling in a human being to be the second Adam alright now this man spent a long time but he was a man he didn't say I know what most people think and I've tried myself to explain it with you no I will get back to it Adam first man Adam second man Adam first man Adam was made a living soul is that what Corinthians says the second Adam was made a living spirit are eternal are the best way for me to put it in human language you realize that second man Adam was the god of glory he wasn't this the son of God that had a father up in heaven and he was on earth as a son and and we got all that now he was Almighty God see you say well who who was and he was God when he was a baby who was running the world oh that's really smart I mean we think were always smart who was running the world all I had to do say it because you see all of God was not in that human flesh he had to come down through time he had to come down through the anointings we'll get to that he had to come to those great things were they said anointing could come on in and then leave him in the garden we've been through these things so don't worry just listen all right see that but here comes what Adam had need of the trendsetting Adam has restored all things I mean in Jesus has restored all things that Adam fell by and all this restored in Jesus Christ all right now but get my point here's the beginning the man Adam a body a spirit and the soul a human being that's what God wanted was eternal life in Adam and then these other things would transpire in the fall would come he didn't make it come I'll emphasize that he didn't make them fall but he just knew they would let's see what was Adam waiting on what was know awaiting them I said there's great things back there great men great prophet since I you know walk off the earth but you know when he's walking off the earth didn't give him eternal life he just walked off the earth Elijah took a chariot ride they didn't give him eternal life they just took a chariot ride oh you said where's yet well I know where Elijah standing waiting till even get back over there don't want them to witnesses I know about that but Enoch I don't know about but I'm just making up illustration great wonderful things took place in the Old Testament under the blood of bulls and goats right you didn't have eternal life through that you can see the Spirit of God as it moves among man and does and and all of the great things that are happening but yet you don't hear him speak of his soul not the vex best you're gonna do when your study needs to get over David and the Psalms and the things you know then you'll find him crying out but that's the display give one come when he come run over then here's Jesus Christ he's the keystone between the old and new Testament that Old Testament was waiting on him all right see then it would start a New Testament he started his church on the day of Pentecost 120 in the upper room all right 120 in the upper room they received eternal life gave their soul eternal life with their body and spirit was not eternal but you see God standing now in the position that he wanted to bring it back remember what was it he wanted to bring this man Adam into being back there but he fell away from it but now you see the bride coming forth and as she's coming forth he turn a life begins to be a picture again and the listen it begins to draw so those are Old Testament people when that when that human being called Jesus Christ stood on this earth you think that I didn't make the word of the word that could field a pool and that's the point of what I'm talking about if you can just see the point of what I'm saying Adam was back back there was nothing else down through there that could take him and bring him to the right place but Jesus Christ good and he became the second Adam the god of glory all right he starts his church on the day of Pentecost 120 in the Upper Room few hours later three or four thousand outside but what did it happen they wrote around said the disciples had these virtues now I'm stopping right there because what he said he said but the headstone hadn't come yet that's his words all right there was the disciples standing there with what we call the faith of the father's eternal life in a human being and the capability of growing in grace and knowledge and bringing forth because that would be the the full-grown second atom all right so then Paul one of those men he one of those that made a proclamation somebody maybe said something to him one day said you know Paul what's gonna happen those Old Testament science and he says well we don't need to worry about to him you know maybe they pushed him a little so he did he just took the whole eleventh chapter and he describes all of them how wonderful and at the end of it he stops and the person again says yeah well what do we do now and Paul said let's remember one time we have within us what that same first Adam had we have eternal life in our soul we are the beginning of the creation of God as the bride across all right and he says now what do we do he said we're gonna have to wait and they're gonna have to wait cause it's not finished it wasn't finished for Jesus Christ to walk on earth that didn't finish it all he has to come forth and become all of the things and make the price and pay it of a Redemption to her that we could receive the life that he had within us but on the day of Pentecost you see what was pulling up Adam come on brother and said one of these days come on he says now quoting him he said Adam would wake up he said he'd reach over and get either says she wake up he said he reach over and get set and able to and he says they would stand up on earth what's he talking about a pool see once that first Adam come into the being you know Adam then when the second Adam comes in there's a direct pool right down through to where that second Adam can take all things all right you'll see that comes right into you and a new birth then there's the apostles in time yeah they had the new birth but it wouldn't have enough so Paul says they without us should not be made perfect well what are we going to do is it going to be that we pull them up and I'm just illustrating that to be carnal or a year carnal raise are we gonna raise up those people off and dust the dirt off of them you know and clean them up and now y'all are worthy I don't think so alright but what I think I've never had too much in my mind to where we're gonna have to walk out the graveyard didn't tell about bodies to come out I don't think so that's why we got the pictures down Stars of the people from here a lot of them that has pie stone and they're young you know why I wanna know what they look like I don't think we're gonna be up preaching or having services in here comes from one who told us David I don't think so now I believe when they walk among us they're gonna be young and I want to know them that I can see all right but now listen then one that God gave His life that could come back and live in me and you trying to make it short matter what Paul was the greatest teacher of the New Testament age you know he wrote most of the Bible all of the things with the great so Paul he understood the communion he understood all the things he understood the change of the body he spoke of it he understood it to be something would happen in the end time and he called it he says you know there have to be a force and an archangel enough to be all kind he understood a lot and he he said I've been to be hung in the glory said I can't even tell you the things I can't even tell you the things that I saw her alright reckon he saw where we're at you know maybe he did huh but the point now I see Paul then he realizes that there's something wrong the coast now there's an argument among mankind whether a mule pulls a wagon or pushes it you've heard that one you know mule and wagon and they argue whether the Mew pulls the wagon or pushes it you're gonna life that because he pushes it who don't know he pulls it will let turn around backwards and they do this way then well no we put Arizona okay thank you you get to hear his own football purpose what do you put the gears on for then you hook up these little trays James back here and ever what you got back there you're pulling it but you're not pulling it you're actually pushing it not just carnal what I thought maybe you'd never heard something like that I listened to stories sometimes cuz they give you a point all right see God is pulling you and I to a place when this message came forward now you can think whatever I've told you over and over when I saw God not say young man let me your old kid I always wanted to see that guard from you know until this day I still desire to see him you know what's left that's made of pool that's made of connection a pool that I have with that and I'm desiring to be that with that see then Paul realizes hey we got to get this on so he says day without us and they said well Paul what we're gonna do he said well until this finishes up we're gonna die and go by the grave we said one day we'll be changed the moment a twinkling of an eye he gives us a hope see he puts something out in front of us now come on listen to what I'm saying I'm trying to explain that they without us could not be made perfect where the connection is as you difficult came change of God has done that down through time from his beginning to coming through to where Adam and David and Solomon and all of them just a chain that's pulling everybody he come right over in the New Testament step forth in human flesh Almighty God dwelling on earth and it started a pool it started a gathering don't you feel the pool we sing that song like knowing I feel the pool I hear the call what can't you feel the pool you realize what I'm saying that that I was looking for something I told my wife when I first reading the Bible I said one of these days there's going to be two prophets come well I couldn't understand Malachi 4 3 & 4 but I knew Luke 1:17 and how it covered and could take you through that to where you would go to Isaiah 42 and you'd find John the Baptist's and the things the Elijah I couldn't understand the coming of a 4-time of Elijah see to be in our day all right let's see a pool started you understand what I'm getting at you realize when you receive the new birth at faith all right you realize the headstones pulling you the headstone is pulling you pulling this to that place to where one day we're gonna walk off this earth alright and see the pool is there that's what I'm getting to why or what why the does it say they without us gonna be perfect because we have to get a line up connection to tie Redemption all the way back to the garden and stand over here and let that come out in the end time and it did in the message of the hour I'm not looking for a message to come forth to try to explain Redemption no we've had the message of redemption that's what we've been waiting on that's what PO did not have come on Paul had the greatest message the greatest writings in time but he did not know what those seals are come on brother branham saw it dreams visions and whatever and it whipped top off and down in there he saw the seals but what they say unwritten word in other words nobody could understand it it took a prophet he realized then that once mankind started he was waiting for Malachi 4 to come into being darzee pool it's wonderful of having eternal life it's wonderful even to be like for the Apostle Paul and how the great gifts and the signs and wonders and all that brother Branham but still there's got to be a pool that's what I'm talking about a pool that that's the purpose of day without us it connects us each one gets connected with that he turn alive by the new birth in your soul makes the connection with you and eternity and all you got to do is just eat your way into it that's what this message was far this message now listen was not to just to restore the faith of the fathers that's wonderful that has to happen but it's to take us to a change of the body and Adam could not do nothing but speak of it he couldn't bring it forth even though the people walked off the earth chariot something like that still that did not bring forth the plan of redemption you see one day then a little man struck the earth Almighty God himself in human flesh the Lord Jesus Christ he was the keystone between the old and the new there's anything what we're doing that's why stir conquer you didn't get it I guess while ago world does the new pool of push the we look back we better start looking forward there I know the story with that true don't look back and don't look forward so ok that's what I'm meaning let's look at the present tense let's look at it right now let's see eternal life right now in our understanding of God's Word did you follow the thought the understanding of God's Word the opening of God's work this message came to bring us eternal life in a body the thing that we didn't have the things all of those Old Testament Saints didn't have the things that New Testament Saints Paul spoke of the change of the body but he never attained into it he went by the grave so is everybody going by the grave until somebody sees it and since this is the day this is the day of the change of the body alright but you see the point is the world then would be waiting coming down through in the Old Testament until Jesus Christ stepped upon the earth all right then he just kept coming on the truth made a New Testament made a pool you just consider what I'm saying that there was a pool started in you and I in the new birth let's see this was not to just stop it was not to just restore a third atom if you want to call him or whatever or a position of atom coming back into doing now huh we need you turn a life in these bodies and spirits that we have that's where we need any turn a life well I thought I had eternal life over there that's in your soul only it is not in your body in your spirit I hope not if you do come here and I'll paint you will find out what you got it give me a hammer I hit you on the toe he says that's it now that's been explaining your silliness we know that there's something wrong and the Bible said Romans 8 that the whole world even everything creation of all things is what groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God right waiting on somebody to step onto earth that was doing and that's what I like about it you talk about even the nature of groaning things what do you think happened when that bull come running at that prophet he just says no you stop there stop go on the light down there and he just looks around brildor oh here he is one day he booked a hornet's nest and it just went all over him we're all hanging around him and he stopped and he said that little Hornets go back to you your nest I'm sorry what are you talking about you realize that nature saw its master I've always taught you that nature so it's master when a man could stand and look at a bull as charging and weighing thousands of pounds and him charging straight at you just look the board you just called lay down right you see I've seen people do things in the natural that you can show the connection we were up in Tennessee one day and was going to a meeting and we stopped to get her something to eat and all and man driver started I had this big old German Shepherd up in the back of the truck and so hey I need to kind of divert around him because that was his truck and I don't didn't think he needed another driver you know here comes this black guy gets out of his car walks up that dog runs into him Wow boy he was ill he got within about two foot of that guy oh lord if he jumps him I'm going out to happen you know I'm thinking things over I read I got run warned yeah about that tunnel that guy he just looked at that dog the dog just stopped and just got a bewildered look on his eyes he said lay the hell dogless laid down I said rotate him do it see there's a connection of us human being is already in the big we are the offspring of God where they're children of God there's people that have gifts like that to where they can do it brother Tatum I've seen him with a dog one day German Shepherd and he just walked right up ladies hand and said why black he said you just lay down there see we've seen things some of you have seen greater things because you were there with a prophet and saw the dead raised the sick healed all right I take whatever little bit of ounce I can get of understanding of helping to me now and I believe it would you see this message is the message to bring eternal life in body spirit and soul well where do we go start believing in saying thank you Lord see to me that's why it says that's the purpose when Paul put that in the word he put in the word if there is a drawing all the way back to Adam this come all the way down to where we are but he said it's going on because he would stand out and freeze and prophesy he prophesied of the future he never reached no change of the body and stuff like that Paul didn't do it would the one that I'm glad though did because the Lord Jesus not only raised eternal life in body I mean in soul he raised eternal life in body and spirit to go with that soul now we've got a pool the eternal life that Adam had in the garden that day says here it is the day you receive the new birth you received eternal life and you say here it is Lord this is the pool that I've had are you listening the pool the things that are happening that's why it says it like they without us could not be made perfect we're not going to pull them up and preach sermons to them know when they walk here they're gonna walk here and eat in the eternity we're gonna have 3040 days for a little while to do a whole lot that's why I don't argue with anybody about these doctrines and ideas or what they're trying to make out of brother Branham and coming back and do it the Bible says he's gonna be here 30 40 days the Prophet says it anyway see we're gonna have a time that we can rejoice they do because we're gonna already be into a kingdom now listen one saying finish the thought after we leave there won't be any Gentile pooling won't be any draw into any more Gentiles even the foolish virgin will have already reached their positional things in life there won't be any Gentile pulling anymore it'll be finished you'll turn to the Jews and there stands Moses and Elijah right standing there it says this is my beloved son and then one pleased to dwell here you him those Jews will hear the word of God they'll receive your people for here you know 120 I mean they're the 144,000 will receive eternal life into their soul but now watch the eternal life in their soul is only a gift and parted they did not go through justification same case in the baptismal holy ghost to get it like you can die so you know where their connection is they're waiting on me in you they're saying over there how long how long come on see all of that is my whole point because I asked him I said well why does it say it like that the day without us cannot be made perfect I understand the wording of perfections and the IRS's and all the different things but he said it made a connection all the way back to Adam in the garden so everything is waiting Roman day read it all creation is waiting Suns in doubt waiting on the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God what if the word manifests me to make no waiting on God to make it known we saw it come on church we're not making brother branham is some kind of a god or some kind of different things he was a human being but we saw some of your seen in person the dead raised the sick healed and the things but they saw God for a moment well you know I'm in bad shape if we think that was all of God no why can't we desire to move on in God and get away from our little things of ideas and well I don't know whether I said or no brother dev appreciated a guy I don't know what he's talking about I'm talking about plainly if you just go back and listen to the message you'll hear me just say the same thing over again they jump into ministers meeting one time and and they said we want you to get up here and explain yourself I said I ain't getting up how's the card if I got up fire we'd have a lengthy time for us to sit and me say over again exactly what you know I've already said so I'm gonna do it I just refused cuz that's what it would have been I'd had to spend hours telling over again what I had taught all them years and see they got real quiet because they knew that was right they didn't pursue it anymore because they knew what I'd already talked so we had a good time we man but listen Church one more time God started in Adam Jesus was the second Adam we are not a third Adam but we are the bride of Jesus Christ the sons and daughters of a living God as bride now which one you'd rather be I'm happy to be called the bride across I'm happy to be the point that I can say Jesus Christ is my husband my savior my all and all I don't have to wait on anybody else I just move on with God let's stand together just think on these things but that's a pool of drawing power when that Lord Jesus Christ went through that death Berlin resurrection he rose that connected him to ever born-again believer but now listen it didn't connect him to just ever born-again believe it connect him to ever person in the Old Testament this is well eternal life an opportunity do you have that eternal life that's the main thing because he can't pull you you don't know what I'm talking about it all on the pool until you get born again and then you find out hey yeah hey something kind of pulling me why is he picking why is it sometimes you pick up the Bible or something and you turn to one certain scripture and you start reading and after a while you realize I've been thinking on that scripture all week see it starts connecting to pulling us to the point of perfection in Jesus Christ
