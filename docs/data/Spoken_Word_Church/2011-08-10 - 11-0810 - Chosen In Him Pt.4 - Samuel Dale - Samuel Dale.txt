John and tonight now we're going to try in a few minutes to get the screen down to where you can read the quotes but we're going to go ahead and I run off about 30 more copies of the ones last Wednesday so if you was asked to bring them with you or keep them and you know but we're going to try now tonight to use the screen to see if you can read them all and you know Richard and Joel will be working on that and Timbo you may have to set up on that stool where you can in and out cuz you're going to have to do it to pick up the you know to do in the parts all right so we appreciate it amen enjoyed the weekend with brother Quinn and hope you did I really enjoyed it had a good time and you know kind of a a little relaxing time to where you don't have to preach and things and that that helps and you know kind of gives you a refreshing start to get to going then come along Monday morning see you getting geared back up ready to to uh start over again and and do the things but uh you know we just pray one for another okay Ephesians 1 and John 15 father we thank you tonight for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the hour that we're living upon the earth and the time that we have the opportunity to be able to Lord sit down for a little while and just talk about you just fellowship with you Lord and let your light shine in each one of our hearts we pray that you'd be with each one here tonight you promised it so we thank you for it just bring your word and heal the sick and deliver the the downhearted and Lord you just let your light shine in each one of us forgive our sins because that's what we want to be is to covered by the blood and kept covered to where that we don't have to worry about any problems we we love you and we thank you and we commit it all now to you and have your way now in Jesus name amen amen Ephesians 1:3 where we're using blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love let's stop there now and then we will uh jump over into John because we're you remember what we're doing now to those on the to the those listening in tonight or on the Internet systems and listening to the tapes or whatever at a later time now if you will please stay with me where I'm at because it will take this message and maybe one or two more to be able to uh get down out of Heaven okay amen now that's what we're supposed to be doing and I have to bring out things on you know of doing but try your best to stay down or stay with me and don't try to run it over to the end of the world and and where we are and the new birth and the things uh just stay with me where we're at cuz we're trying to stay back before the foundation of the world right all right and we're trying to find out how that we were chosen and that we were chosen in him all right and then in the choosing part then we can come to that place of you know of seeing uh what's going on then when we come to Earth see then we will I kept emphasized and I will again in just a moment cuz I want this in your mind you can't see what I'm talking about if you think it's your chosen by him or you were chosen of him that's right those are already in the those are things happening in the Earthly Journey that's right cuz if you go back too far with of him or by him and things like that you're going to get into the wrong form of Doctrine or thought and see my thought is to try to get us to see how that we were chosen in him then when we come to the Earth I'll tell you all right now we've come down here and now we can talk about chosen of him or by him and the choosing will be here and our journey of life will have things to do with it but I told you the other week that I gave you one quick run through of how we were going and then you know to able to drop back down and then we will just give quotes and and try to bring it so all right go into John 15 verse 15 henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doth now I love that scripture right there I could preach all night on the fact that he changed from calling them servants cuz the Old Testament people were called servants right right and then coming over to friends right and you remember even Judas when he came amen he looked at him and he said friend right because you could stay all night right there but okay let's go on henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you listen to it you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you amen you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now they're trying to get that up and if I can get it up good enough then we'll be going through the quotes and you won't have to do this but if you want these you know uh after service to be able bble to keep I will uh fix them where that we can just you can come by and pick them up right cuz we're going if we can we're going to start using this form of system to where I won't have to make off 60 copies of quotes and we'll let you read here and and Timbo will have to zoom it in to where that they can read it on the uh the thing and now Sister Gail it it all set up now you can holler amen all you want to because the sounds not coming from that anymore it's going back to the machine and back I come no I was you saying you could get brother com no yeah we won't get none been doing all right but now listen like I said if you will stay with me of what I'm trying to say I'll tell you when we drop down to the Earthly Journey which will be many many messages uh probably on down the road road so we're trying to talk about you remember that brother brandom and I ran a bunch of that today looking at it and you remember when brother randam first met the uh what was the Jesus name people or which one it was the Oneness that he ran into and you remember the old black brother and he said all the other preachers had been preaching about what was on Earth and bringing Jesus out of the scriptures and he said man I was really enjoying him and said here come this old man up with a little ring around his of high left and old and had to he him up there you know and an old big old coat on and and said he thought my Lord what are they letting that man up there preach for you know with all these young guys and after a while said he started off said these others are down on Earth said he started off up in heaven MH amen and said he's telling us what's going on in heaven right he said then he brought him down to horizontal rainbow and said you know you know well now I'll tell you when we start down the rainbow okay in the message and you that are listening in please if you'll do that you'll understand what I'm trying to bring CU we read here at Paul said we were chosen in him that's right chosen us to be technical where you will know the scripture part there chosen Us in him all right now as I said if you say we're chosen of him you you know it's getting down to a technical term but you'll see those will relate after we get here and to say chosen by him see you you got to let that come on over to the Earthly Journey cuz if not then you make him a respector of persons and he cannot say that you know that I that I'm not that that I you know you got to wait till you get here to start predestination you got to way do you get here to start the for knowledge into life see now he can sit back there and have it but yet see when you come down here remember what I kept trying to bring out if it's for knowledge then that means knowledge before but that means knowledge of what will be all right now but there never was a time of forn knowledge now listen cuz this this is on my mind so you know if if you get discontent with me for the next 10 or 15 messages then I'll just tell you right up front you don't have the Holy Ghost and and because you're if you get discontent then you don't have what I've got in my heart to try to bring to you so I'll just put it that way and then you get mad at me all right but I'm just honest to say it because you know if you say for knowledge remember for knowledge is God seeing what will happen here right but there is no for knowledge to attributes that's right all right I'm pausing when you're talking about attributes healer savior deliverer etc etc there was never a time that he didn't have that right so it wasn't a forn knowledge that he would have that oh man amen come on Amen come on see you're you're you're getting messed up in your point of for knowledge there was never a time that he didn't have them attributes his attributes is eternal and part of him well then there was not a time that he had a forn knowledge of having attributes right because that would mean he had a for knowledge of having something in a later event right he never had that he always had that for knowledge deals with when you're getting on down to the Earth ly journey and existence all right and see then let's let's just stay where we're at see then that point then we we've kept trying to bring out that we were not chosen of him or by him back before the world that would have to come over to the existence of time and this is not talking about people as little people running around up in heaven see see you you can't put us back there like that the only thing that can be back there is the attributes of God right that's right all right now if you put us back there that's pre-existence right and see that's what the Mormon Doctrine is that we were all up in heaven and decided to come to Earth right and see that won't uh that won't pan out you can't have pre-existence of souls reincarnation or or anything like that then you say but I've got a quote where brother R said All Souls before the world Amen that was in his mind amen amen see now that way we can cover the whole thing see and and and I've kept trying to make a point to you was Jesus chosen of God or was he God Amen that's right no sir right you see well he chose to do see all right that's coming on over here see you're not staying back up there with where I'm at in my my thought or idea did God choose for Jesus a son to come down and die die for us or did he choose to come himself amen see then if he chose to come himself the choice was not God choosing Jesus remember I I I kept emphasizing that where it said we were chosen in him in who who were we chosen in right we had to be chosen into Christ amen right right all right now and who are we chosen by is this a father choosing a family come on is this a father choosing a family you don't even do yours that way no right your natural existence never even come that way you didn't choose to have your children God's the one that's for ordained it toward be redheaded blackheaded green whatever it is know all right but you see amen he didn't choose a son to come and die he became that son that was his choice that was his choice to do that all right see then keep that in mind his choice is what ordained everything to be right okay see then we were chosen in in him into Christ all right and that the attributes all right now the only part of us that could ever exist before the world would only be the eternal life that we have right all right now that's sensual that that doesn't need a a bang Wing over the head to make you get a revelation that's sensible if you try to make anything existence how you going to make him Elohim self existing amen amen or existing alone you're going to start putting little something there and that's what all the people the message like the two Soul peoples and the thing they want to draw out these things put dots in and you're this you're that you're this you're that you know oh it makes a beautiful picture yeah but what good is a picture if it don't fit the right a cow up in a a beautiful you know cow up in a tree eating leaves off the tree that's oh that's a beautiful picture you got the cow you got the leaves you got the grass oh that's wonderful no right the cow's up in the tree see something's out of order amen all right that's what we've done with the word of God our thoughts has put it together to make a picture and when it comes out it doesn't exist in the right order all right right now we were chosen in him and he is the word that's why I I'd like to spend a while on that scripture because it really just opened up the other day to me and and see then there's been so much argument even the people of the message don't like it where in John one your Scholars are scholar type of people in the message they don't like John one where it said you know in the beginning was a word and word was with God they don't like that word with I love it amen cuz the only way to explain it amen amen amen the word was with God but the next verse ISS what and the Word was God Amen that's right so it's not a width of two people standing but it's a width of the bases that see you and I were with him but in him right we wasn't with him as people standing there Jesus wasn't with him as another person standing there or even the forms and never was used in existence until it was needed of the word the theop etc etc sort of God you know coming down see and see we were with him but we were ining that's right amen now if you don't get nothing out of the me message tonight you get one point I'm not not talking about choosing now we'll pick that up more um probably the Lord willing Sunday but I want your thoughts to stay on that if we have eternal life then that eternal life is the only thing and I hate to call it a thing CU it's a person right there the only thing that is eternal amen right is God's life that's right and see if we have God's own life in us then the life we have in us always was eternal now there's the argument of the people of the message a lot of them believe that oh we come here with eternal life well then how could we have eternal life and us sinners amen they make an eternal sinner that's not even sensible Amen brother Dale you're not supposed to be sensible it's Revelation well if Revelation won't fit the word of God Amen it's not a revelation amen what I said if you don't like it for me to keep repeating over then you don't know what I'm talking about go pray right and ask God to reveal to you what's brother de trying to say amen he been on it long enough but here's the what the thing that we'll hold if we can tonight if you wouldn't part of him before the world you'll never be part of him if we wasn't part of that eternal life we will never be part of him amen how can you make it Adam was impartation amen that's it he received eternal life impartation that's right he never went through to make him a a member of the body of Christ right do we call him a Son of God yes but not to bring him to be a member of the body of Christ cuz that could only come on the day of Pentecost amen and see then those that are given eternal life at the white throne and things like that they will not be a member of the body of Christ that's right they'll not be his wife so then going be by impartation amen so there's a lot of difference in impartation and actually going through an experience that's why the disciples couldn't receive the they could go through justification sanctification that's right I can even show you where that was only potential because it couldn't be a a full point until Pentecost was was was made possible Right even your Prophet said it was just potential right but you see they couldn't get eternal life right until Jesus Christ died because the eternal life was in them right now by predestination sure Jesus was walking in them that's where our trouble is see we want to make Adam coming in Eve that's not the way it is it was Eve was in Adam our the teaching of most people makes Jesus coming in us as he would come into the world cuz if you came into the world with eternal life then Jesus would have to be in you cuz he's your only s of eternal life amen but see if you believe it correctly and see he could come here with me and him now that's the only part I'm talking about is what was in him of me and what is that that's that eternal life or else you're dealing by impartation see and it won't work you're you're going into the wrong way see so now listen we know the first thing that went out of God God was an attribute what else you going to call it and You' call it the word the seed all right now your Prophet says Church age book what is it one what 154 Church age book it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God amen amen it's the seed our word right all right so let's don't deal with a person of this what you're looking at none of the things that you can see and none of the actions or reactions that you could see by this individual could be back there before the world right because you can't see eternal life you agree right you you can't see it you can see manifestations yeah but you can't see eternal life you can't even see my spirit cuz I can deceive you right in my spirit tonight I can be as as hard as can be and deceive you into thinking that I know what I'm talking about and see that's why you got to have the Holy Spirit if you don't have eternal life you don't know what I'm talking about am you never will know what I'm talking about until you get eternal life right so eternal life is the most important thing in the world Amen a lot of head knowledge is fine but we need a lot of Holy Ghost knowledge okay first quote what do we got now I don't think Joe put the the things that we got it identified and we're going to have to figure out a way to be able to to uh and I know they can do it so we'll have to figure out how the way cuz you'll know that I just jump in and well maybe it starts down here okay now he's got it where we all right there above me can everybody read it you don't when I give my glasses you know but look what he said now on a message called uh identification preached in not identified Christ of all ages preached in 1964 uh 401 this is the first paragraph now look what it says he is now in you you are his attributes if you've got eternal life your life always was amen and you was God's thinking yep the color of your heart whatever you are you was God's thinking and what and you're just materialized amen now you're not talking about just coming in the world cuz watch the rest of it and that's what God was when he was materialized in Christ so they not just talking about us coming into the world right he's talking about what we are in eternal etal life where're the Christ amen cuz it's the only way to have eternal life amen see so then as he is just he was materialized see you're just materialized what happened the new birth brought us into a position to where that we're materialized he said just like Jesus was that's what was Jesus the alive word amen right eternal life in human flesh all right so then we that's just a point see all right so then what are we now what are we we're his offspring right but let's get to the number two which is believest thou this preached in 1950 716 paragraph E15 right and what does it say remember Jesus had all the qualities of the father in him do you believe that sure he did all the fine gifts of God was in Christ his son for he was The Offspring of God right now Jesus was The Offspring of God what is an offspring now this the only thing I I have to ask you to do is is when I get through with the quote and I stop you look this way you get looking over there you're not listening to me you're reading that's why I underline it okay so you keep on reading you're trying to if you need it we'll be glad to give you the quotes you know but we're doing our best cuz see all we could do is we could do like most people do most people you know what they do they give you the title they give you this quote yeah you would have nothing to read I don't choose to do those things like that because I want you to see before and be after but I want you to get back this way when we get the quote made all right so then listen he was The Offspring of God now how was Jesus a Son of God how was Jesus a Son of God and remember now we're still back before the world right so we know the flesh Jesus wasn't standing there so bring that then come down to where he comes to the earth now how was he The Offspring of God because he was God Amen an offspring of God is God in another form right amen amen right are you following me amen you are The Offspring of your mother and father now you're not an offspring of your mother and father and a neighbor you understand it right there's not four or five people involved in this situation got you here so then a word Offspring it doesn't mean someone adopted into the family it doesn't mean any of those terms it means a direct descendant and the basis that that person is now increasing his own uh uh he he's dividing himself right and then you're an offspring h so then Jesus was not a second person amen he was almighty God Amen that's right see he was not as I said when we started that that God would say I'll send my son down no we don't believe that do we how many of you quotes you needed that where brother R said he came himself well you're just Oneness well you just come up here and explain it that's all I've asked of anybody I'm not trying to be sarcastic or hate I just ask you to explain it some other way either Jesus was almighty God or he was a second person y if he's a second person one of them's got to be the devil cuz you the only way you go in the Bible and have two people one of them got to be the devil cuz it God can't be two around said that even that Jesus was not the second person listen he said he's not even the first person you need that quote he said he is the person well you're just an old Oneness that's old Oneness Doctrine well I wish you would come and show me then because there's not a Oneness person in the country can handle the way the prophet brought it amen that's right because he could move that almighty God over into another form called the word theophany L God speech Etc amen and let that be the Creator and let it it let it communicate back with almighty God if you think that's Oneness I'd like to hear you cuz see a true Oneness would say oh God poured into Jesus ain't no God right y That's why I'm against that quote that what people uses it not to quote brother around he made exactly right amen but see we say all God was he poured into Christ you're just doing away with all of God then you say all Christ pour in the church you just don't away with Christ ain't nothing but me and you and that's the devil's tactics to try to make us believe we're God right right in the wrong way right I'm not trying to make you believe you're God now get that out of your head that brother Dale is trying to convince you that you're God no I'm trying to show you you're God right amen that's right if you have a new birth tonight your God made manifest in flesh that's right yes sir it's not something that you're trying to make somebody something God is the only one that can make you anything amen we're it's God expanding himself amen that's right and he'll never go back is what I love about him God started there before the world to expand himself out into the word form and the thing and as that come forth we begin to see ourselves there and as we do then he finally comes down here and then we become his offspring here and you know what he never goes back to being self-existing oh what a wonderful God he never does away with any them attributes amen he just come right back to where he's at and and he'll stand there and look at his attributes and see them that's right amen I'm not trying to get you to believe your God I'm trying to get you to believe what God says about you right are you listening right see he was The Offspring of God look at the next one they identified Masterpiece of God 1964 1205 so we got basically the whole paragraph see now we notice that God began to make him a a bride for Christ so and the bride must be identified with him and in him now watch's your Prophet identified with him and in him see we we're you know we're real good to uh want to say we can take the Bible and and dissect it to the m that we make sure we get all of the little wording right but get brother brandham and watch his wording and you'll realize that somebody else was doing the wording because a seventh grade education man couldn't do it he wouldn't have that thought right there so you're identified with him and in him why because he is a part because it is a part of him you're talking about the bride okay now the bride is part of him she is part of him the word for that day that's right that's it's not the person that comes predestinated Eternal Word of seed okay the bride becomes part of that word for it's Christ that's why brother R said if you read in the Bible and don't see Christ and never verse he didn't say if you don't see Jesus in never verse he said if you don't see Christ in never verse go back and read it again amen see we're the Christ all right the Bible he calls it the Christ of God for him now and you believe that congregation says amen we have to be in Christ and watch him I read these before you know in Christ we have to be of Christ in Christ part of Christ right that's wonderful isn't it amen what does a woman when she takes a man or a man takes a woman that woman has to be part of him there are no longer two they're one that's where the trouble is is when they're two yeah right I bless God I'll be the I'm going to be the boss well you going to go wrong on either side so what does he say and when God in Christ became one they were one because God was the word and the Word was made flesh the Flesh and the word became one and when the church becomes Christ's bride she and the gospels are the same amen how can you say then the days of Miracles is pass see part of him I'm not talking about anything that I'm talking about part of him I'm talking about eternal life not talking about me and you as Body Spirit Soul I'm not talking about any Earthly part of us in our journey I'm talking about eternal life amen there is only one form of eternal life that is God's own life amen all right now I've told you over and over I don't believe we come in the world with eternal life I believe you must receive eternal life after you get here amen all right now we get to that way on down the road but to those that's listening to make sure you don't go me in the wrong way I don't believe you you come into the world with eternal life make an eternal sinner right and I won't even fit nowhere in the Bible except the devil and his ideas amen all right but you see a part of God the Eternal life that you have has to be a part of God's life right you agree amen all right so it cannot be Body Spirit and soul of a human being right CU if it was part of body spirit and soul then that put whatever it would be back there that's what I asked a man one time he was talking about it we were coming back down the road some of the brothers remember we were com back down the highway and this brother he he he he he was a two Soul kind of and going into those doings and and he is talking about us with eternal life I asked him one simple question I said where was the eternal life was it in your body was it in your spirit or was it in your soul he said I'm not going to answer that he knew better do you know what I done I shut up but you know what they have two or three brothers in that car they got on to him and you know what when we got down to where he lived at he wanted out of the car he was willing to walk a little piece if necessary amen cuz I didn't say no more to it that I just ask him one simple question CU it just won't work out all right let's go on now so brother randomman what God's provided place of worship 19 65 4:25 now you read all up and down while you looking at it but look at what he's saying now we are seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus all right okay are we on the same one okay now wait a minute 65 425 paragraph 137 yeah it's got to be in there somewhere now we're already resurrected Dynamics mechanics I'm going down into the to the quote I'm going down to where that I got what's underline now we are seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus sitting in there that great seat that's already fired up been raised from the dead we're a part of it and if you're a part of the Bride you are because the bride is part of the groom you know she's part of the groom see now we we humanly we don't look at that that in that form do we I mean even as the the oldest ones in here are being married the longest I I guess is Dick and Gil UH 60 what I mean 5 56 that's just 53 see you're still two people the best you can talk about it's you're two people right and and the best you can do you have two people with two ideas right but that's not so in the body of Christ that's right see that's a natural to top to spiritual so then it it's not so that we have become one so much until we don't have no different thoughts that's only an example right but see in the body of Christ the bride and the groom is the same that's what I said we've got to cover and it's hard to cover things because we are a body right we're the body of Christ parts and difference and everything we're the body of Christ we're the bride of Christ that's another form of using right we're his wife we've got many things to look at but yet look at it what the scriptures say in this situation it's not a groom you know in the scriptural situation of Christ in his church it's not a groom and a bride as two different people so you you got the wrong concept right it it it it can't exist as groom and bride is two different people not in scriptural terminologies of the body of Christ cuz we are the body of Christ right members in particular where that body amen he's the head right but yet he's in every member of that body the only thing that you can think of or in any form to bring it out is this human terminologies he's the groom we're the bride all right so it means when we get there all right now watch if you don't get it all together what have you got when we get there if he's the the the the groom and we're the rde when we get there they just be two people standing there come on he's the groom we're the bride there'd only be two people but that's not true and neither is it a head hanging over here and a body hanging over here it's just a way of expressing something when we get there we'll be like him the Bible says we'll be as him you know what it'll be when we get there he'll be standing there you know what he'll have a many membered bride y amen many people will be standing there right and it's typed better by saying that David was a man one man and he had a thousand wives right right but you know what none of them wives could have another husband right right right but now what did David have see our human Minds David didn't have a th wives come on every one of them was his wife right right wife he was only typing right give you an example each one of them women was his wife right right and how you going to TP the body of Christ if you don't do these things right but you see we just go oh boy that's right well he's the ride we're the groom oh we're the ride he's the when we get there there'll be millions of us running around over here now how you going to bring that if it's just bride and gr I'm sorry I don't mean to be you know just Tire up little bubbles I just mean to try to preach the gospel to where it can be understood that's right when we get there he'll be standing there and there'll be a many membered bride standing there with him right you know what eternal life will be in him eternal life will be in every one of them am that's right they'll be just as Eternal as he is brother R said you receive the new birth he said as far as your soul is concerned you're just as Eternal you're just as perfect as God is amen you agree amen because that's what he's made you so didn't get that away they we're just Grooms and brides and parts and see now watch the next one what is it God's provided place of worship 1965 425 getting down what we got underline he's talking coming down said that's in Christ Jesus and today oh how today that I would that everybody would see that see how to get in being baptized the bride is part of her husband the church is a part of the word right the manifestation mhm so now you got a part of the husband the quote before you had part of the groom and the bride now you've got a husband that's literally in his bride you see where we got to keep it in the right order to understand that's right if you talk about eternal life where we going to go oh but brother Dale I don't care about what you're stand there with you oh I just I just BR preaching I just feel so good well amen but remember the prophet said it doesn't matter how high you shout make sure you walk straight and you come down amen make sure you know what you're talking about you know when you get back down you know and walk in it so I gave you the scripture there in Acts 17:29 where it says for as much Paul was talking to them at uh you know they're on Mars Hill for as much then as we are The Offspring of God mhm we ought not to think that the godhead is lik UN the gold or silver or stone Graven by Art and man's devices why is it that you ought not to think read it why is it you ought not to think about the godhead being anything right you know gold silver Etc et why is it you not think that he gave you to keep he said we're The Offspring we're not gold silver right whatever he is we are right so you see what he's saying see the scripture see then if we are The Offspring of God we are not even think about the godhead being any other thing amen right let the word that's right righten wasn't the one that said it go to uh unveiling of God Mighty God unveiled and listen to the prophet say that the bride is the fullness of the godhead bodily amen I didn't make those statements he did you see I'm just trying to get you to look at something look what he says now on the next one 1963 God God hiding himself in Simplicity which is and then revealing himself in the same there you know words God Simplicity 1963 317 on that side he's talking about the CM then then we failed Etc and come down he said on that side he's the son of God he's an offspring of God I now don't count discount the fact that when he comes over here what we are he's an inheritance of the earth that's right see now he's bringing us over here he can control nature he can speak into existence why he's a Creator himself he's an offspring of God what is an offspring of God was Jesus another God was he a Son of God God being another person him being another person or two or whatever who was he God made manifest in the form called a son who are we God make manifest in a form called a bride that's right amen amen the children The Offspring of God so I want you to get this that's what I'm going to take these things it's like Offspring then we'll go into to to another one on Tuesday then we'll go into another one on on uh uh Joel I mean uh job and and where were you when the Morning Star saying together I said we have the answer now that job couldn't even have the answer to right I know where we were all right so what is he he's an offspring from God now remember what we've been in the scriptures in Romans 8 that we've been talking about that by the new birth that we become the children of God right and by doing it the scripture then says that we're ours join ours with Jesus Christ amen so if you want to go along with the big old brother up north up there that says that Jesus was just one half of God go right ahead but I still love it because that make me a half of God that's a whole lot better than what I used to right that's right I'd be happy about being high wouldn't you but want be a half when we can have the whole how can you explain it how can you explain that Jesus that we could be joint HS how can you explain that that's right amen the only way you can explain that is what God was in Jesus Christ that's right and God is in you amen how else can you explain that's right amen what else can you say where we at look what he says about 1954 1212 he swore by himself PRI in Jeffersonville he's talking about coming down and and Jesus and the signs and the followings and what he say why he became a part of him yes sir God's on the instance of deliver in deliver anything he'll make a way when there's no way he makes a way in any man that believes in him because the same thing he has to he's a part of God he's an offspring of God he's a Son of God or a daughter of God and he can do nothing else because he's God because he's God's right with him he's just a portion of God now if I misread some of this you put it in the place it's supposed to be I just do the best I can my education I try to read the way brother around and saying right he's a part of let something make sure I read it and any man that believes in Him believes the same thing he has to he's a part of God he's an offspring of God he's a Son of God or a daughter of God and he can't do nothing else because he's God's right with him because God's right with him he's just a portion of God what is it amen a portion of God I'd be happy wouldn't you if I come through all of this world and I got down the end of it and I found out that all I was going to do was get eternal life I'd be happy wouldn't you but you see that's not so with the bride amen she already has eternal life if you're born again tonight you already have cuz what will you do you'll do just like what he said now look at the next 1955 uh 610 I guess it is I had to cut the top off of that and then say do you now believe he believed in his own word and if a man's born of the spirit of God he's an offspring of God and that part of God is in him and he believes every word that God says will materialize and so that makes him part of God the holy spirit in the man makes him a part of God a part of God are these just idle quotes to you or is it a prophet telling you who you are amen that's why I said if it's not important to you it's idle quotes but if it's God telling you who you are it's worth a lot right amen 1962 118 convinced in concerned and remember when you die and that Soul leaves you it never changes no sir death doesn't change the soul it changes its dwelling place but it's still the same Soul so if that Soul isn't born again and a part and a part of the eternal spirit of God it had a begin anything with a beginning has an end that's the reason God is the only thing is eternal unless you're born again and have eternal life the Greek word Zoe there means God's own life in you you'll perish but where God's life is in you you can no more perish then God can perish that's right because you are a son and offs of God and have eternal life oh that's the thing the church needs then when God is in you then he lives his own life through you so are you seeing what I'm talking about an offspring a part of God now if we're a part of God now we had to be a part of God back there right all right that's why I'm not talking about Body Spirit and soul of human moraly we'll get over to that bring it down to a new birth and the things you got to bring it all right we got to receive eternal life but I'm talking about back there if we wouldn't a part of God back there we're not going to be a part of God here that's right if we was not an offspring we won't be an offspring here we don't become an offspring we're are an offspring right that's why the scripture said it didn't make us that right the prophet of God should the you birth didn't make you a child of God right you said but what all right we'll get to that one later we had to receive the new birth right but it didn't make you Eternal because the eternal life is that new birth amen that's right come on Matthew 62 12:30 the evening service is this the sign of the end sir he gets on down and explaining it but there can't be an eternal hell because the Bible said hell was created how can it be created and be Eternal if there ever was the Bible said hell was created for the devil and his angels and then if it was created it can't be Eternal CU Eternal anything Eternal never had a beginning or an end now if you was created we're going to have to get to that one later I get okay better hold it watching that's how we can never die that's right because we was always now what's he talking about are we like and I'm sorry to even bring it up in a situation but are we like the uh latterday Saints man it just got through and they've tried him and give him life in prison you know what he believes he's a prophet they believe 10,000 followers they believe he's a prophet he's a split off cuz he's not of the main part of the the thing cuz there's many millions of those this is a little Spur off but it kind of has it but you know the the the Mormons Church of the latterday Saints they believe that they have prop coming down through time right and that Prophet is to come and tell them of the things that God wants man to know and if there's any changes whatsoever he can change the situation right all right and you see this guy he he had a bunch of young girls for his new little wed Brides because he believed and see he taught them right but that's the only way to have eternal life is for them to to do what he said y you see we believe in a prophet coming amen I can take brother br's message and prove to you anything you want me to prove in the way you want me to prove it right sure anything you tell me brother Brown told I can tell take you to brother brandham and show you where that he T seemingly contrary right amen are we just another latterday Saints on or are we the bride of Jesus Christ amen that is we set up above there he believes his own word Y and any child of God will take God's word above what any man tells him just listening last night to a tape and one just a few days before you remember the income tax case with brother brandom where that they he finally had to make a deal with them for $440,000 counting the lawyers fee and Etc and all and you know what he says and one time he says he went to one brother I won't call his name because it's on the tape but you can do and told the man that he needed to borrow the money and the man said I'll give it to you the man paid the $40,000 what he says we listening to him last night he said that a bunch of the brothers got together from the church and went down to the bank and borrowed the $4,000 anything you want brother Brandon I show you quote contrary they're arguing now whether he was out there hunting at a certain time and what was going on it's been argued all over the country where he was born again at was it in the Woodshed or was it here or was it there or where was it because it sounds like he's talking about about three or four different places but you see are we concerned with that or what he taught us in Bible that's right of what the word says that's right well he wasn't don't want to it was all right that's what it's in there for for you to fall off right amen he never taught but one true and living God never taught a trinity he said I'll show you a quot quote where he said let's stand and address the third person of the Trinity that's right anything but you see what has he done for you amen like brother dick says if he proved he had 40 wives they wouldn't change what he's done to help him to understand God right right right he might not have said 40 but he used a number see because you can always find what you want to find but what about eternal life amen see if we got eternal life who's going to worry about all of that this message has brought eternal life to me amen what about you this has brought a revelation of God to me amen what about you right well that's what a brother done just recently said brother BR was wrong said he said if he was wrong to get away and that's what I'm going to do okay listening to him the other day where he says those angels come down to him out there and he said not no more than five then he said no no no brother Dale he said but on this day he said not no more than five right on the others he said there was seven and you're going to go with just something like that and just die away because that that little something is not compatible in your mind or whatever You' want to call it sorry about that see if you have eternal life that's how we can we can never die because was always we're part of God The Offspring of God and he's the only Eternal thing that there is brother Brown knocks on the platform pullit three times amen you can no more die than God can die because you're Eternal with him what is it what about it all you need some kind of something to kill your influence right brother Dale you shouldn't bring out things or to kill people in it's not going to kill nobody that's born again that's right amen amen that's right and I don't mean to hurt nobody else and if you had it all put together so perfectly until that everything would be and it would never be a misquote anywhere ain't going to save nobody right Jesus Christ is only the Salvation there is right it's not the letter of the word right it's the Revelation to the heart right cuz when you get that Jorgenson book you'll read it you'll find out that his brother does a good job cuz brother Brandon was out there when he was hunting and it's been I've known that ever since I've been in the message that there was an argument about that thing and you'll get in ear brother does a good job expressing it and brother random was the the Angels the the picture that was taken of the cloud that's in the magazine was almost 1 month prior to where brother Randon was out there but yet he sounds like it the angels went up and made the cloud no just the same Angels amen was no problem just the same Angels see but yet we can arue see right over those things and reject the word all right see this proves we don't have the Holy Ghost because God believes his word amen and if he's in you he'll believe his word that's right if he's given an opportunity let's continue on 1953 5 11 we have found him come and see he's talking about the the features about about your father and you look like your father and this that and the other and he's about the same size of his father and a whole lot of features and all because I'm an offspring of his and if I become an offspring of God In My Soul then my soul is liking something on the order of God it believes the supernatural it believes for everything see what I mean there's another story on there that people are on to things the doubting brother Brandon they said he got to come back and kill a brown bar said he said he kill it well the only thing I'll say is one thing are we going to bring a man back in the resurrection like they're saying he'll come back in the resurrection go across the country and preach and that Eternal man coming from the resurrection Eternal man will take a natural gun and go shoot a brown fire now that's all I'm saying right that you got an eternal man killing a brown bar see that's that's what people are they're based on all of that he's got to come back and do this well what if he comes back and do is is he going to be Eternal in body right amen and then you'll take a gun and why don't we do like this brother down here done when all that fell through that he passed on but he's supposed to kill that big old deer well they just started preaching he's going to get it in the Millennium well is he going to kill it in the Millennium no no no it's going to be with him well that wasn't what he said he said I'm going to kill a world record dear kill a world record there amen that's correct why not just go on and forgive it let everybody have what they want to okay 1954 1203 the law having a shadow a man must be born again by the spirit of God and then the the black spot on the tape Spirit of the Creator himself comes into the individual and claims relationship is sunship you see it then that person is an offspring of God and God who spoke the world's into existence and this man's an offspring of him he can believe anything all things are possible unto him for he believes he's a part of God he's a son or a daughter of God you believe in Divine yes sir go on down 64 1212 the Harvest time if you have eternal life there is only one form of eternal life and that's God's that's God so if we have eternal life we were with him right then a part of God we were his attribute we are now his attribute because in the beginning was the word right 1965 1119 God The God Who is rich in Mercy now if you got eternal life tonight if we have eternal life then we always were because there's only one form of eternal life we always were and the reason we were because we are a part of God and God is only only thing that's Eternal so now brother random is talking about eternal life he's not talking about you and I being before the world with God in some kind of a form or a person or whatever a soul or a spot or a DOT or whatever right if you if you Ain put a dot back there you've added to God come on how can you be self-existing if you can put a dot right come on drop on down the same message cuz we're still in that was paragraph 42 this paragraph 44 now we are part of God you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in God you were only in his thinking your very name if it ever was on the book of life was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were right keep on reading God's power to trans transform 65 911 Sons and Daughters were in God at the begin was in God at the beginning now look you've got eternal life you say well we believe it that we got eternal life well there's only one form of eternal life and that's God Amen that's the only thing that is eternal as God then if you got eternal life that life that's in you always was and you were in the loins of God before there ever was a world right and when the world itself Jesus himself is called the word and the St John 1 said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us then we were in the loins of Jesus and when he went to Calvary and went to Calvary with him amen you died with him and you raised with him and today we're sitting in Heavenly places in him fill with his Spirit Sons and Daughters of God die with him raise with him sure go right on down reading same it's just a continual reading down below just another paragraph below now then now now you can fellowship with him you couldn't back there because you were just a word in him a seed but now he has manifested you and now he wants you to fellowship with him him then he came down and was made flesh so he could perfectly fellowship with you see the perfect Fellowship Oh my he talking about them deep Mysteries next paragraph Jesus Christ was God himself manifested because he was a son because he was begotten but it was just a tabernacle for him to live in now I got the quotes on that he's the only begotten the Bible says yep so we better be able to believe we was in him we'll get to that in another message CU he was the only begotten amen all right mod EV this made clear by prophecy 65 1206 now you're a gene of your father and you were in your father yet your father had no fellowship with you because he you was in there but you knew it not and he knew it not but you was manifested that you might that he might fellowship with you and you being born again you're born of eternal life and that's the only one form of eternal life and that's God's life Zoe the Greek word Zoe only one form of eternal life then if you are a son of God or a daughter of God you were in God all the time but he knew what bed and time that you'd be planted so now you made you're made a creature a Son of God manifested son or daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living God of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time that's right you was done there before the foundation of the world if it wasn't if you wasn't chose that way no matter how much you try to impersonate it you'll never make it all you believe him right no matter how much you try to impersonate leadership 1965 12 1207 there's only one form of eternal life and that's that comes from God and he ordained every creature that would ever have it just as you were the gene in your father you was a gene in God one of his attributes to begin with are you'll never be there you come forth into betting ground of your mother your father didn't know you you were in his loins and when you come forth in the beding ground of the mother then you become a human being and are made in the image your of your father now you can fellowship with him the same thing by God if you got eternal life the life that you that you come in the Natural Life physical life that was by your father and the only way you can come can come born again is the only way now what the and the only way you can come born again is the only way it is it is it has to be your heavenly father his attributes all the father has given me will come to me you are here because your name was placed on the Lamb's Book of Life before there was even a foundation of the world that's exactly right you're a gene a spiritual Gene out of your heavenly father a part of God's word that be so as I said then you was with Jesus when he was here because he was the word you suffered with him died with him buried with him rose with him now sitting in Heavenly places in him right 65 11 11:25 the invisible unit of the bride of Christ if you're married to Christ Christ is the word of God in St John the first chapter in the beginning was the word and the word with God and the Word was God the same was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Christ was the Living Word he always was the word he is still the word he always will be the word he was only the manifestation of the attributes of God for he was the son of God and any son is the attributes of his father and just as you were in the genes of your father in the body of your father when you was young boy you were in him yet he could not have fellowship with with you because he didn't know you but then through the bedding grounds of a mother you were brought forth into the Earth and become in the image of your father then he could fellowship with you so and so were you sons of God and Daughters of God before there was a was a Moon Star or molecule you were Sons and Daughters of God for you you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning right for there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when you was in your Earthly father but you are manifested to In His Image in the image of God you are made and you were manifested for the glory and fellowship of God and therefore as sure as your Gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual Gene had to be in God because you're an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world right now way around no way around it that's right that we'll notice then that life being in you God's life being in you from the foundation of the world let's get a couple more we got a little time 65 1205 things that are to be now the only way that you can be a son a daughter of God because because you have to be have to have eternal life now is that simple enough the only way you can be a child of God is to have eternal life simple language all right there's and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life only one form of eternal life that was God there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always now watch what he said it did the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecu see you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as the Son of God now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age you are expressing God's life in you because you are a son or a daughter of God therefore you get what I mean congregation says amen you are in you are now are now made you're sitting in his this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and to this people and this neighborhood where you where you associate that's right wherever you are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you got eternal life then it always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation World knew that you would be here and when the word or the water the washing of the water fell upon you you it was expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father God just as you have with your Earthly father see you are citizens of the king listen not citizens but you are children listen to it not citizens right that's fine but that's but you are children sons and Daughters of the Living God if it be that the eternal life dwells in you future home 648 O2 future home of the Heavenly bride Grom and the Earthly bride now in the beginning was a word and word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the three stages it was an at was an attribute first was in God that he thought of himself as being human and that transmitted him down to be Jesus and now if you'll ever be there you was with him then for there's only one form of eternal life that's God and you had to be a part of God at the beginning not what you have chose down here he chose you right listen all the father has given me will come he chose you you didn't choose him amen this is back before the world when we get over here we'll start talking about how we chose to be a Christian and God honored that and saw you would want that we not doing away with anything the prophet taught already covered the message straight across now you need to go back go back and listen to that message again the other Wednesday night all the way through and listen to that where I took you to we're just now backing up to go that same way all right on the message which would be page 284 of the church Church age book or sardian church age we have the same right today in the church names are going to be blotted out of the book of life no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life for that is another record though contained in the book of life this is the record God hath given us eternal life amen and this life is in his son that's in the scripture what first John over in the the writing he that hath the son hath life eternal he that hath not the son hath not life eternal and those who have that life were in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world the great Royal seed Jesus Christ was planted he died and that life that was in him came up through the wheat plant and is re reproducing itself in M multitudes of wheat seeds having the same life in them and being like the original because right by Spirit they are original all right lot of f reading but go back and think about it if you have eternal life that eternal life always was eternal amen but did we come into the world with that eternal life in US if we did I'll just ask one question that's all I've ever asked if you think you come into the world anybody listen to this and you say I come into the world with eternal life I want to ask you one simple question what did Jesus Christ die far amen that's right yes sir what was his purpose Amen brother I got where the Prophet said that Jesus didn't give me eternal life glad you can read but you better read a whole lot more eternal life was in God before the world ever begun but that eternal life was in Jesus Christ that's right that's iten that was the only way to get it here to you and I right amen was for him that die to release it that's why in the Old Testament they could not have eternal life you say prove it Jesus Christ died for once for all amen that's right solve the case amen he died one time for all all of those back there look forward to Calvary we look back to Calvary right to see what took place amen eternal life is a person it's not a thought a concept an idea it's not joining a church it's not reading a prophet's message right it's not saying oh I I believe everything brother Brown says there's people that saying that that today ain't been in the church in 10 years probably they believe everything sure people are doing that that are married three or four times you know I'm talking about polygamy deals right do they believe everything brother around said what about it see I believe that back before the world the eternal life I have was a part of God right and it was just transmitted down through the fact of Jesus Christ dying to release it to where I could receive it and give me the new birth then I can squ with the Prophet I always was eternal why because the eternal life I have always was I'm a part of God now I'm going to try to end this Mak it as strong as I can make it let's still don't get the idea that predestination for knowledges and all of that doesn't have something to do with it sure let's still don't get the idea of that you know we don't have anything to do with anything we must receive eternal life that's right God will not override your freeo agency amen and make you take it that's right he will offer it unto you and you have a choice to receive right if your choice is that you receive it then it prove that he saw you before the world but remember we're back before the world talking about it amen I'm still back there talking about part of God I'm talking about chosen in him as being not a choosing like we decided something right or that he decided something M he didn't decide to have a family and then let all the rest of this come down here to just do some works out and do things his family was a part of it right prophet of God said where were you when the morning start saying together sons of God shout of Joy he said when they saw the Plan of Redemption come into view before the world well we had to be back car then amen but not as little people running R amen that's right yes sir not as Spirits he said was we Spirits he said no you would nothing you was in God's mind see we have a great message but what are we doing with it that's right eternal life is a person do you know that person right of eternal life that's the only one that can hold us in any time or whatsoever or keep us from falling into any false Doctrine is that person of eternal life cuz we're human Mortals dwelling in in a time of mortal life am subject to all kind of spirits and thoughts and ideas but what does the word say did he choose us before the world and say well I'll choose Wade but I won't choose Samuel said right no amen but that's what it looks like doesn't it m come on you human you mortal that's what it looks like don't it but it can't be cuz it make him a respector person right but see then we think it's the great idea that he chose Wade because he knew Wade would want to have salvation that's true got something to do with it but if you go that route then Wade's got something to do with it right MH he chose y God didn't choose us in him but we're chosen in him we chosen in whoever was back there and we better look back there
