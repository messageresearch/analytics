========================================

good to be back in the house yeah talking about a lot of a new mother they keep back and I see you you're not doing well keep running prick that's all I find even though we don't even know what you bumped it all right so now we're almost ball today we're on the 6000 scale one more time we're gonna do the six zero once again look at what's going on with the state c up standard and then whale love then with all of them I want to take a gap like the property any kind of stop and then next time you may do something a little different a little special a little thing before we start into the Seventh Seal or we may stop here and just continue upstairs and then run it all the way to here and then we'll do it all if they will see so we'll see what the Lord has but continuing on for those of you that work your wings you're a bit less and the winds near was here whatever wins the night we started on the foundation for the seals to speak on them upstairs so if you have not listened to easy not service please do because it was faster it was a good foundation for you to to to understand what we're doing I mean you just say well here's the seal here and that's what that's all back that we've been doing is here's the seal and here's the part that's up under it we're going to cover a little of it but we'll cover more of it upstairs and we're going to stay on the foundation for a while so before we get into the first seal so let's read this I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it was the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see I start before Whitehorse and then we know what happened to him another horse that was red dirt steel was white the black horse the for steel was the pale horse all right and then the fifth seal remember the fourth seal the rapture takes place on the fourth seal so the fourth seal is the rapture seal now I always thought maybe the Seventh Seal was around to seal but it's not seven seals Christ but the four seals a raptor seal each one of these seals I was talking about the club the other night on the phone or actually when we're out there and he's been going through the seal some and highlight them and and each one of them has a different characteristic and we'll talk about that won't you name it seals but the fourth seal has to be the rapture seal because that's when we take graphic it's on the fourth seal all right we take a body change and everything happens right in that fourth seal it's like what I like again I'm studying more now like William was talking about last Sunday that comma that comma was 2,000 years that comma represented 2,000 years in church ages or whatever there was of time it was in the comma and like a Randy our last on Wednesday night that one scripture in Compass's the whole church ages from crop before it starts to the time that it ends in just one three four words that's why these that's why now I can see more that the Word of God is eternal one word you take one word or one phrase or even that comma which is a lot of commas of cause we're going to continue this all the calls ferment just thinking about what's going on and then continue on so that's what we were looking at to Wednesday night is that the seal breaking showed what that seal was and that's what we've been covering but there's an underlying meaning to every bit of the man there's a there's a revelation we'll talk about this afternoon despite the revelation the Prophet said though there is a supernatural element that's underneath the revelation you say how do you know that well when when the Lord revealed one God to you it was a simple God want Jesus in God's the same person but now did they stop there no it did not stop there it brought everything and to me in that one guy to me one God is is it's all through the Bible right so being the one God is always through the Bible then the first seal property God said if one steal can time the entire Bible together well I can see that more now than ever it's not just a quote and we'll read some of this afternoon where brother Brown said the Bible became a brand-new book well now I thought he just preached to seal revelation 6 through 8 right they know when he preached in the seal well that's not the whole book but he said the whole lotta became a brandy but why did he say that well because it tied the rest of the Bible together yes just like in the water baptism the other Sunday speaking on there there was some things in it that I mean everybody knows the baptizing them Lord Jesus Christ was that's just saying look read this brother I said that's just the ability to read it's playing let's repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but one one cup bottle sex oh yeah I can take that to the point but I ain't gonna take it all the way Bible says the Bible says the stone to stone the God that all right the Bible says cut the hand off that the Bible says an eye for an eye yeah okay jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood see them come out so there's an underlying meaning there we and taught me another day was on like the other day truly most people in the message have they have a top-level revelation they never around said the seal of them but remember that's just the ability to read and put scripture together yeah revelation 6:1 is a mighty angel or the angel come and says come and see John and one still open a while right now well even people you know that's where people that leave the message they said well Clarence Larkin thought that Clarence Larkin might have talked out but he didn't have a message behind it right your revelation I mean miami-based people got together here we go back to the narrow minded people this message they're so narrow-minded and we are too to a point we get so narrow-minded but we get set in this one way and blind everything else just like the seal well the seal is opened in 1963 that's all there is greatest message the Prophet ever preached and it's just laying there on paper no there's something missing that we're not getting because I think when he said right from faith lies in the books and the tape so if he live in the books in the tape that means it's laying there waiting for us to bring it out because I'm telling you and I'll tell you this afternoon we are that seal group of people that brother Brown talked about in questions and answers and I'll prove it this afternoon I touched a little bit on it Wednesday but I'll prove it this afternoon where it was not meant for it even 10 years ago certain group people yes a certain group people now come on everybody 10 years ago 20 years ago 30 years ago it wasn't meant for them a man my brother I said it wasn't meant for them and that was 50 years ago okay say it's gone from Ian and then he said this is that third pull and then if you type close together where brother arms of the third pull is laying dormant it's laying there it's not being used except in a spiritual way me and brother club become a good point because it can be used and it's always used in the like adoption we all every one of us revelations eight what is it 14 says we received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry daddy daddy cry that's a baby once you're born into the family you are under the terms of adoption now that doesn't mean you go to adoption not everybody is gonna make a good option right they hear you him the sword in the hand we'll talk about this afternoon her brother ran with the sword in hand to me was the adoption of brother Branham it was giving the word to the Prophet and saying here whatever you say that's what's gonna happen cuz the sword he said fit my hand perfectly so that's the same way with us to be we all are under the spirit of adoption because once you're born into the family you get all the family benefits now you may not get up all the authority you know you may be you may be three sons and they're all three sons so in other words they're all three born-again sons and daughters of God but one acts different than the other one free moral agency I believe that because the Bible says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God we grieve the Holy Spirit so much until that we may not make it to adoption but that one son that one son when he comes to a place and that father keeps watching because watch what brother Ram said brother and says the Holy Spirit goes back to God we know less Jack's of a play there's not a Holy Spirit that walks up to God and tell him you got that acts of a play same person and truthfully the father knows what you done sit for the foundation of the world he knew that's why he could say that we're all adopted sons and daughter cuz really in the body change we all become adopted sons and daughters of God because see Adam lost sonship he lost the right to be in the day he wasn't adopted basically in that position because you know what God didn't come down and interfere with Adam before the fall whatever Adam said that's what happened well why because he was throwing to him done remember I've said many times before when the the tiger came across and Adam said Tiger God didn't go no women no God said that's exactly what I call it so that to me that's adoption is that the father and the son are one so much that you can't see the difference the father can go on a vacation like you come to the father can go on a vacation and leave it to the son okay so but now some of the other signs what about the prodigal son prodigal son he went out and get all the stuff in the world but when he came back he was restored once you're born again you can't get out of the family of God you can miss yourself up you can die an early death or you cannot make it to adoption that's your to me that's God saying here this is how you do it if you do it fine if you don't find we all gonna get to the same place but it's like I sell them brother Claude you can't throw it out there though and say well if we don't we don't somebody is going to come to full authority just like Adam and Eve standing on the earth to say dead come out of the ground an adopted son of God a daughter of God has to be alive and at that position to call the Dead out of the ground what to call who out of the ground sons and daughters of God they didn't make it to floridaa sin to full authority but somebody's through to me I believe through the opening of these seals answering all the questions that we have I have a lot less listen you know you're born again this is my home this is my this is me I know I know I'm born again because he said well make your list no because what I started with has progressed if you're still wondering about the same things that you wondered about 20 years ago go back remember what brother rambling when the guy was dying he said now lay me - where'd you leave God he said now I lay me down to sleep yeah go back to that spot yes it's ignorant not to because you know that's what he knew that's where he lost God hat you know where you veered off yeah you're the only one known you know where you've been in another direction when you should have went in this direction you know you did think you shouldn't do but you know what the prodigal son took all of his fortune took all of his wealth and went out and just in other words playing a prostitute pretty much he just stole himself to the world but the father always knew he'd come back the father always was waiting for him and when he came back he didn't say now why did you stay home 20 years and why did you do this one no he said open arms kill the fatted calf put him back in his position ain't supposed to be in and that's the way God is doing the you and I is he's putting us but now remember there was one son that stayed ever home huh he was about to publish business this one what but he came back around because he was part of the family the father couldn't deny that son he had him he was in the body so when you get borning him your revelation should progress and I'm telling you your revelation should progress you shouldn't not have knowledge no we think no there's no more than than we did a year ago six months ago but when it truly ties together when you start seeing that picture like we've come back Wednesday Peter grass cow tree and remains where it's supposed to be I say at home everything is where it's supposed to be but it's not the strap position the tree can't be up here in the clouds yet the tree is part of the picture the cow can't be in top of the tree counterpart of venture but he's in these out of his position the adoption is a position it's a position you come to and the position you come to is is is it has nothing to do with your wealth of your natural being are the not wealth of your natural being it does not have reading this morning brother Adam even brings the Seventh Seal people I won't read maybe another son your food from out the stair and still people that's me and you the Seventh Seal people are the 11th hour workers the Seventh Seal people see we come right here at the end they've had all them years to to have all the 2000 years since Jesus died and then up to the 1500 swear they wrote the Bible in print form and then all the way through and they've had Martin Luther Wesley we now have had William Brown with all the tapes in the books what have we come to some have come to an intellectual knowledge some have took it and started progressing on up well actually up the pyramid okay go see that Holy Spirit right there that's very important it's not teaching you get get the Holy Spirit up here you get to always bury here but that is not what that is what I was talking about Wednesday night that's a new birth from according to my account for that's taking us to the headstone that's that breach here and the priest to get us out of the church ages get the baby turned right and get us into the seals come see the baby sure the baby was the baby was conceived it wasn't the baby came from if I mean the baby was conceived wrong the baby was conceived right but we were turned wrong I've seen my death the other day the furthermore to that Wednesday night we'll talk about today dr. Polk to me the other day and he said he said what is a breech birth and I said well it's when the feet come out first he said we're not in the fee date he said were no headache he says that head had to come first so thank God for that then they get a little faith to bottom either cutting grass or glue and my other thing so but we come to these seals don't we see that that in the fifth seal because I want to show you a little example and then we'll talk about that stairs with this fish seal you see a group of people that we talked about that was given white robes and they did not care about Jesus Christ right they ain't care that's the grace of God well brother Brown said mayors and divorce was preached in the seals right show me where he preached a minute see he did not he hardly mentioned marriage and divorce in the seal but I got the quote for brother Brown said marriage and divorce was revealed in the seven seals well to me right there's where it come in that fifth seal Jew went out did whatever they wanted to do didn't care what they did and God give him a white robe same thing with you with our management divorce problem he didn't do away with our problem but he did bring us grace to where we could accept the grace of marriage endures and go on and not let that bother us anymore all right all right with that see but then you got to peel back the onion and see that that would that that is like I said that is for the first revelation for your body change comes remember in imagine divorce situation and a brother the other days well you know I know I I know I divorced the devil in man Jesus no that's not right he was the guy in the message - I hate that you can't divorce the devil you have to kill because if your old husband is the more sisters you're not supposed to marry again if he's alive now if your old husband's DEA they don't when you think that that was dead d-day I don't have that old man was dead if he's dead then sisters you may in the Lord you man who every month a cop that same thing with the body change the grace of marriage and divorce freeze you once you once you get rid of that old husband sisters don't go kill your husband the spiritual hair all right because then if you did kill your husband you go into that part where a murderer won't enter into the kingdom balance don't be careful that I'm just covering all my bases okay I don't want [Applause] [Music] somebody's looking online and see if the insurance policy fight but that's not all though you know what that's silly that we have to explain that but you know what somebody's carnal mind would take them to that yeah well because you say well how'd that happen well Paul gets up and starts preaching about the resurrection and that we're resurrected sitting in heavenly places in the resurrection of the inside man you know we've been resurrected and carry it out of here and two guys in the church to preachers Phil it's us and how many ins they go out and start preaching it Paul said the resurrection was over right that the resurrection had already happened well Paul rebuked don't turn them over to them to the devil remember the Bible description why they took what he said in misinterpreted totally misinterpret what are you talking about and the Impala says work we come into an out resurrection which come up out of thee and that's the same thing with you and I if this is not a new new birth but remember we're birthed into every one of these Peter had to pick that up and say being born again being born again we're right here running around a few the statue perfect man this seals everything in so let the capstone can come down the capstone can come down on here like we can was talking about the other day it has to fit perfect right here and actually it doesn't come down it's filled in by the Holy Spirit seal them so to me this right here that's that that's that part that nobody's reached right here because they may have right here the Holy Spirit in the in the face of the Father but that Holy Spirit that capstone is the Seventh Seal so they've never been preached correctly by man until brother Branham preached them listen in 1963 and beyond because he never put preaching on the seal if once they opened in 1963 he just continued and preached them all the way till he passed away he eclipsed because because adoption is placing here or sealing all this in because brother Clark now we're talking it truly power without character satanic so you can still have the new birth and you're doing things wrong because you you do get power you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost to them in some scripture but you can use it wrong we all do we use it wrong okay but right here the power with character with all these working the Steep brother Branham couldn't people when he reached the place of adoption whatever he said that's what's gonna happen he's gonna walk Tennyson around town with alcohol y'all are gonna die today and then all about today God went had to honor that word but God knowing that even in its infancy when those two kids were making love in the auditorium the property God said God told me whatever you say he said and he said thankfully carry them out here get out of here dead yeah if I don't have spoke it now I'm not verbatim at expert he said he said whatever I say it see I'm take something that's God given authority to a human man yeah okay but it's the same thing as God you authority to a human man named Adam one time I don't was a human he was supernatural in the Genesis 21.6 man but when he put him in that 2:7 man he became a natural human breathing a mortal human being so what am I saying it's not so weak that man this is gonna be like brother Clark now we're talking that's not not for that see if we think that adoption is and it is it's placing it's putting your way up in a top position but it's not that it hasn't been done it I've done it the Lord Jesus done it brother branham done it we've got mouth of two or three witnesses how it worked so it's not something that we're going to come to and then we don't have anything to background no go back to Adam go back to Jesus go back to brother Graham there's your three examples of a manifested son of God adopted able to control nature okay if I got that so that's what these seals doing and you got a look if we way up when we go to them upstairs we'll have a little more time and we'll break it down a little bit more than even what we did down here so now we're in the sixth M and I'll be helmet opened the sixth seal though that was great earthquakes Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll and it rolled together and every mountain and island were moved in other places you see all this all this is nature earthquake son moon stars heaven earth feat tree figs wind heaven Mountain Island earth now you bring me in here you bring in the men in okay but what happened they ask the rocks to follow on well they they went in a hidden cave and they wanted the rocks to fall what a great things it that's why no I'm gonna say this real real reverently and see you look at your you look at your foolish virgins and they know something's going on because there's something going on with us they feel the pull well these men here because thanks good people on this earth there's good people yeah there are that's good and what we would say nominal Christian people that's gonna have to go through this they're gonna have to go through this so you're not talking about what I'm saying is you're not talking about total ethan's because look they calling the lamb now sinner someone I regenerated never gonna make it that name never on any kind of book like my brother Graham said now he doesn't know a difference in a lamb and Jesus Christ don't care about right so something of these men and all these people why are they hiding they know just enough what's coming because remember the foolish person during this time during this period right here and I didn't bring this out today during this time period that we're looking at the six seal the foolish virgin will be hunted down and killed millions just like the six you know it's like the six million Jews were hunted down and killed by a man Hitler the same is going to happen to a group of people they didn't go all the way with God but the foolish virgin see they're coming to get oil they're coming to us to get oil [Music] and like Mia Louise was talking last night we're running out of time for even y'all sitting in this building I mean all that when I say y'all I mean all of us we can't keep going back over and back over they certain time where God says all right the horsemen are here if you're a woman you just want to stay one because the horseman is heading in that direction yeah okay and I mean that with all seriousness she's God's gracious to keep looping back and picking up but what he does when he leaps back he knows at least a dog don't do anything wasteful yes think about this of the bait he loots back and he may not get but one person one person he one person he's got that one lost sheep he's gonna let the ninety and nine keep going remember but he's got he hears that crime that one lost sheep he comes back one more time but you know what he does that sheep he breaks his legs he's serious about it this time you're not getting away from me this time and he carries him to the 99 I love that I love that this man we are go now that's probably why they know they'll come to us now I said nano they'll come to us now well now what's going to happen see this is this is after thinking I'll explain that come in done it's plain good enough that this is all where we are gone what do you want to say the bride thank you the bride of Jesus Christ that's boring in and all seven church ages has taken a rat took a raptor but now because remember go back to you go back to your type there was ten virgins now remember they were virgins they had never been manhandled by man bright brother Brown said to be man held by man is to be in the denomination okay so you got you ten first wanna say a lot of people in this message you're gonna be food for that's because they're not gonna be taught enough to come to a place of receiving the Holy Ghost good look let me just be real honest we you never buy on internet if you're pastors not born again and you're underneath them you're not gonna get born again unless you hear something else and come out and go in another direction so all right but though watch you got you ten virgins know what happens they all hear the same cry right right they are all hear the same cry and they all wake up it's not that we call them five sleeping virgins but it's really they all wake up at the same time these don't go back to sleep but what do they do when they wake up and they find out they don't have enough oil they go looking for it but where they go they're not going out here to look for it they're gonna tax their self to these five wise virgins right they don't start coming back to church they go they know where the oil is and they say give us of your oil and we're to tell them look we got just enough to get ourselves out of here you gonna have to go find it somewhere else and then when they left the cry came come up the file went up in the five state weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth now that's the five foolish burden that will be right in here because look you can't have this brought in to just heathens I mean who cares about the Lamb of God if you're just the center if you just don't write you don't know the position he holds as a sinners now as a center to be repentant to be regenerated yes you do know that but you have to come to you know you go out on the streets and you say who's the Lamb of God well somebody that may have heard something in the Bible they must it but we know that's kiesza but if you say the Lamb of God most people worldly people they don't know what to do but no know who Jesus is well I know the Jesus is okay yeah because you probably cuz in his name of like you know you doing one thing but they don't know the position of this lamb but these people do that's why I was looking at this was another one the onion peel this is the foolish virgin crying out hide us and the dens and rocks of the mountains because you know your foolish virgin here we are narrow-minded people again the food partners are not all in the United States of America they're all over the world okay they're all over the world remember ones in the bad ones awake or twos in the bed into the wait one goes in one state well the 2-litre awake or during the daytime and the two that are asleep is you know they're in the backside of the earth they not you know the world goes wrong so the words perfect you just won't let it be the same and the hoots he loved it for the great day of the wrath date of his wrath has come and it's going to say that and you're not a Christian people the world's not going to carry the world is one of the ones it's going to be gnashing of teeth and wailing and think I'm know what just like Puerto Rico you know they just total devastation and I've reading this morning where that the governors all got together said we need help now we got people just wandering around the streets and don't know what to do and and in a disaster situation a lot of times we do we know it takes all of us it takes all of our normalcy away yeah hey you think look when we lost power for 44 days last week Monday through Thursday we came out of a normal routine yeah we had to go get a generator we had to go find extension cords we have to go find lights we have to go find you see our plan we have to go find a place to plug in our cell phones go out the car blowing man what if your car's gone you understand once and so that's just a that's not even up that's not even a pimple consider them what them people went through you know yeah so but what about this let's take that my 10,000 more times yeah all right so let's just don't be here yeah this is going to happen okay this is going to happen and we can read about it and we can study it and we can say thank God he's like I told your wings you're not the one of the greatest things that God revealed to me three the prophet of God is that I don't have to go through the Great Tribulation right I don't have to stand before the white throne judgment to me that frees a lot of things from me all right because you talk to a denominational person first thing I'll tell you is we gotta all stand at that white throne judgment and these songs that they have you know standing before the throne standing before the bar we don't have to stand before that one thank God for a prophet thing to tell us that but you know why it's always been in the Bible but it's not verbatim you know when he says and the books are open there was what was it there was Thrones brother Brown said drums that means as much people there it's not just one there's one sitting on the throne back over in Revelation 4 or somewhere over an arrow when we come over to the wife own judgment he said you know there's throw me thrown employee that's where we are we're not we're not gonna listen we're out several million people gonna be setting up on the front all right you are the throne okay cuz remember that's what revelation 3:14 is supposed to tell us he told us that what we would give is that we could sit with him in his throne now we can't all sit in the front I mean on the front but we can all sit in the front there's room enough for all that was in the throne but now on the throne they'd have to be a real big one look at Aaron in different ones and all that just take the law to a lot of real estate and my brother Richard Douglas it and cover a pretty big throne anyway selling but in the throne I can put all the believers in okay so so thank God for that but yeah this is your foolish virgins they're in here crying out there are the ones that know this is coming they're the ones that no even remember the Bible says there will be a still small voice tell them you missed it now why would listen why would God tell a sinner that senator okay he's telling the foolish virgin yeah you missed it you were that close and you missed it because brother branham in and what makes it think that he said after the rapture they'll keep on going to church and think they're getting safe Collette will tell you something once the rapture takes place and the people that are attached to us see us miss be missing they're gonna be right in looking they're gonna be searching and they're going to realize they missed it let's see what are they gonna do they're gonna keep their mouths shut no they don't tell their tell others they gonna tell others and then they're gonna tell other the crowds going to go out that they missed it and they're gonna cry for the rocks fall and what one hurts me they got two prophets on the scene they can turn their heart back but God's finished for the Gentiles these two prophets will not save one Gentile because the Gentile door sure I'm not sure there I'm sure that the manner that right they just got receive the Holy Ghost and but a but look they can't receive the Holy Ghost it's just like I said before they can't receive the Holy Ghost while that while we're here because if they receive the Holy Ghost then they gotta go in a rapture with us right so they can you say well they're over they can be in a sanctified condition they could be they could be said in the message Church over here but be of Jewish descent you know I'm not looking for them these people will not impact me do you know what we impact them more than they impact us because unless we get out of here them to can't do their job and they'll receive the Holy Ghost will go up and the Holy Ghost will fall right down to prophets and guess what there'll be the only two people in the world with the baptism of the Holy Ghost at that now see how precise the word is they'll be the only two people that have the baptism of the holy birth in their soul but now then 144,000 is gonna come out of that okay and then what's gonna happen then then when they left off the earth don't remember the foolish virgin don't have the whole dumb they're gonna be hunted down and killed down through the tribulation and then when based in profits in 144,000 leave all hell's gonna break loose because why the wrath of God as long as there's a son listen if you have a son or daughter in a kingdom and you were a king and you were getting ready to raid that Kingdom and you you you you you were gonna kill every person in that city but your son or daughter was still in that city a natural king wouldn't do that he would wait till they got him out then it would be Katie bar the door all the way from the front to the back kill them all because that's their commission but as long as there's even one got to name him if you found five you know Sodom and Gomorrah I'll save the whole city both of them he couldn't find five he only fell what forward live it's live from the two daughters now if God would assist a favor had what it said for God would have said Whitman I got a four were down there while we know what happened to Lot's wife but she was in there and had to come out so you see how precise the word is Abraham stopped at five he said God have you find five you know he started with 15-minute winning and down to five or ten and then he got close is to hit you didn't ask the right thing but that's why Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed because they had to even wait to lighten them we're out of them out of the city okay so shout perfect word is and thank God for a property that we could put all this together by by one by revelation not by just because these two prophets like I said they have they're waiting on us we're not waiting on them we don't need their message colors to the Jews we don't need their message but they need I miss it and I say our message I say they a message of the hour they need our message to take it to the 144,000 and then what do they do being prophets they start a nature cleansing of the earth but say no spiritually you and I through the prophets message Jesus Christ coming down and speaking to us do a prophet but then Jesus Christ now speaking us to us through the Holy Ghost in all of us then we're getting a nature cleansing in here if we don't get cleansed in here none of that's going to happen so the nature cleansing and the sixth seal does start right here then they're a natural seal will open when we're gone all right let's go from [Music]
