else worth anything but I love and not understanding so just come and have your way Lord just bless the sick among us reach down and touch each one never brother Dickie our Lord and touch him bring him on out of these things and that everything be alright thank you for your loving your grace in Jesus name Amen go start with about verse 6 and the Sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and for thy servant for thy maid for the hard servant for the stranger that sojourneth with thee now remember the rest for the land the land gets the rest and all like that remember that part okay but then it goes into the human part all right so you take from the land to to do in the next is what animals culture and for thy cattle and for the beasts that are in thy land shall all the increase there will be meat and thy throat number seven Sabbath's of years under these seven times seven years and the space of the seven Sabbath's of years shall be unto the forty and nine years then shalt thou caused the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of the atonement so you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family you may be seated Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now I got I don't know what you called it I got I don't get nervous preaching I get to a point trying to bring something out and that makes me speed up and I was going to let it go and you know but I think we need to make sure that we understand the scriptures about things because that way it's not just taking what somebody says is taking what the scriptures are actually saying and letting it be the answer to it more than just to be you know a point that we we look at and I hope he was following my point I've tried to make it over and over and over we know that there's a Sabbath ever seven years there was a release every seven years all right now then it would go seven times seven and it would come up to 49 that's an automatic doing all right and see then something was to take place in each church age because the seven church the the seven sabbaths is top of the seven search ages as Feast of the trumpets paragraph two to 38 28 right and there was supposed to be a time tire of a release and it would come all the way and come to the seven churches that's what I want to hold that point because I want you to see it because to me it's marvelous to think about how perfect the scripture goes one two three four five six seven like that it comes it comes out perfect if we follow the taller the lineup and don't get our ideas and you know get to thinking on something and take it for what it's saying all right it had a jubilee ever seven years all right you work six years for somebody for your debts if you sold yourself into bondage to him as a slave as the Prophet would call it but it's a brother to a brother it's a Hebrew to a Hebrew and then when it does is it's when you go free there was a freedom ever seven years in the Bible time that would type then the seven churches so it would show you the seven churches is gonna have a freedom there was a freedom as I was trying to say this morning in each church age a release was in each church age whether it be Luther's justification Wesley's sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost under Azusa Street it was a release it was the time to let man go free Linna but it stayed in a seven and remember this as long as you're in a number seven that's where we'll get to it later I meant to go into this evening but take me too long so I need to cover this because it take me too long to try to maybe next Sunday just take both services and try to speak about and if I would if you would between now and then to read the message called the future home of the heavenly bridegroom in the earthly bride all right and that you'd pay close attention to the statements that brother Branham makes about the seven and it represents the Millennium alright because it's the seventh day out of Eden but then he starts talking about something that mankind had never hardly I don't know of any doing it and teaching it that way but you know breaks it to a number eight and he actually says now I brought a random you're trying to put something beyond the seven well now listen to what I'm saying Church you say well if we understood this we we are you saying we don't want your prophet said there was something beyond the seven and nobody knew anything about it now there may have been people who picked up things and preached them and read it and things like that of the number seven Scofield mentions a lot of the things about it but they had no comprehension you didn't hear him preaching of a future home you didn't do it here I'm in the Book of Revelations trying to explain it because they didn't understand it that was we didn't have no comprehension see it took a prophet and I'm saying this it took a prophet that had spent almost three years in bringing his own message as I was trying to explain this morning co-brother honest message started right there right before the opening of the seals he's the one that said these things you'll find it in the rapture and things like that not in the years of preparation but when he begins to sound you said what was he doing before he was doing the work restoration back to the faith of the fathers because that was the to part off 327 Church age book 1 turn the hearts of the children back the faith if I to reveal de Thunder switches revelation contained in the seven seals we see his message didn't begin until bringing this the seals into view because his message was not just a message of of a release at the end I was trying to explain it and I know I mess up a lot trying to get you to see it but this message was the message of eternal life there's never been anybody taught it like the Prophet taught it now you know that's true I mean there's no church taught it no denominations taught it nobody told us about these things I'm telling you honestly come on somebody might have preached a message on it that's what gets me you say this you say well so and so it's wrong nobody's ever I heard that well it might mean one time they heard it or one message or whatever I mean for a doctrinal issues and things nobody knew those things it took a prophet all right now then in doing that if you watch what he's doing then watch what I said he's he's bringing a to part of the message he tried to preach the seals back in and he preached him entitled it to seals in wala 55 55 56 somewhere out at night but then the seals broke to him in 63 all right see then that was his message to bring those years in before were in preparation just like I was trying to explain each church age had a messenger and a message to bring to that age all right and that was the only way you could be in the right of that age was to follow the message of that age and the messenger in his ministry all right because that was God's Way of doing it but see then none of those ages went to a completion to where that you could totally go for 8 they kept being a little scruples little problems and run around and said this messenger come to straighten out all the screws he said he didn't have no message of his own you remember that we said he was to take all the loose ends and time together all right see there was loose ends he said on that seal book he said there's a mysterious part of justification a mysterious part of sanctification a mysterious part of the baptism of the Holy Ghost there wasn't understood by man you mean Paul didn't understand just K same came back Peter no he's not talking like that he's telling you there was something to her that was those seals would open up to bring into view we see each church age and I tried to explain see then they would have a release but nobody took a rapture nobody took a change of the body everybody had to die and go by the grave so then number one number two whatever you read it wouldn't work but when you come to the seventh one you might not have understood that part maybe I need to spend a lengthy time on it I've done it before but there is seven church age angels but there's eight manifestations of God in the church ages I read it to you where the Holy Ghost came himself or huh he was the messenger to the lady of C&H was the Holy Ghost then the Prophet comes at the end of the age if you'd understand when he comes to do and compare it with what we're gonna read in Leviticus the word that that priest rides through the land and tells everybody the freedom is to come you couldn't just throw you ho down and walk off you had to wait till a certain time and that priest had to declare it the gospel trumpet is what tells you you're free so his church age messenger was bringing the gospel trumpet between you come up to the seventh one and it's a marvelous situation the Holy Ghost comes to make way for the Prophet would you agree to that he comes to make way for the Prophet to come on this thing all right then when the Prophet comes the Holy Ghost enters the Prophet to bring the message we'll get to it next week and they hit it just a little bit right at the end this morning on this evening but you know yourself that people are tied up into what a little bit I tried to explain oh how that thing's he comes in three and sons nine so the man of God son of David where would you be without a profit organization people are our ideas and thoughts after hearing a little bit they could express that and understand it but where have you ever tried to hear it explained you know that right in between he says between that son of God and Son of David he comes back at son of man now that would have to be in one man to start with the messenger of the age all right but then it has to go on over into the people because they're got to receive the freedom that's all right yeah see then if you're following what I'm saying to the bride of each age had a release we read you the scriptures to where there was the limitations on the seven you go into bondage with a wife you come out with your wife if your master gave you why the wife in the children stayed you know with the with a master I've tried to be even sensible about things that you think I'm not you think I'm hard but you know what I tried to explain a brother to a brother and freedom when that brother would let you go free it didn't make no difference what you owed because it was the law of God it was the Word of God they were keeping and God would bless that person they said I go into bondage brother Colley cause oh and money will see God for me in him for me to keep my part of the word and work hard and try to do everything and for him to keep his part of letting me go free God's gonna bless that cause it's God's Word a blessing is there for those thing why because he's speaking of salvation all right speaking of a time that would come that there would be a real rest that Jesus spoke of all right and see when he come he had his rest to speak of just as any other but his rest and he spoke up was he turn alive that's what Jesus was speaking of when he said coming to me are you labor and heavy laden and I'll give you eternal life I'll give you rest well huh because that was to be what it would would come out into finally in to the ages you know to be the right thing okay then that seventh you went six you know Dave's that seventh year the sabbatical that would come to work that you would be speaking in the seventh think about that messenger he rides through the land telling the people they can go free at a certain date he doesn't go through necessarily and say you're free you're free you're free throw down your home go home go you don't know nobody know you've got to know he it's the Holy Ghost whatever that God wants me to do I must stay and work for brother Colley until my pay is done or my time is up when God would establish my time I don't quit ahead of time saying bless god I'm leaving no you don't do that this is all speaking of salvation and speaking of it remember if you're going to bondage with a wife you come out with but it's from your master give your wife and she has job they're supposed to study the church case you see something from one time about salvation in the Old Testament I'm just I'm serious I know I say thanks funny and I like that but do you think nice I'll go work for brother Colley I spend my time I work for it okay he tells me said all right you can go free and we went through and explained what the Bible says he's supposed to give me enough to take care of me to get me started right wouldn't do you think he's going to keep my wife I'm just serious sure I think about salvation maybe a little different you did I don't see that brother Colley would keep my wife even though he gave it to me and had a right to he's my brother he wouldn't keep it bless God I'm gonna keep her I'm gonna keep her children he'd have a right to because the law said it what do you think he'd do it would you do it you know no you would you would say okay you take your wife and children and go home we're all brothers it to be no poor in the land the Bible says that's what I love about it God takes care of he made a way for everything all right we see when that lies we're not 7th aids or seventh feast I'm Jubilee would come it's very special but I said you can argue back to back you can argue all you want to about how you get to the 50 the only thing I've ever said and talk it's one time they will one day have to become a literal 50 that will be your future home the eighth day so to say there's never going to be a fifty you're wrong what to say well this is a 50 you'll be wrong the best thing to do is just let it go and think about it as that messenger would ride through the land telling everybody that could go for me if you think about brother Branham circling the world seven times going about and declaring freedom was anybody ever preached freedom like he did no you know better than that nobody ever know anything about freedom like he did let's see freedom to us is like we think about getting everything gift to us free of charge that's not free to me there well I don't have to go in bondage to him ask my brother that's not freedom see we make our own stipulations and points and we wind up listen what I'm talking about in plain language when your prophet brought his message the first time of mankind that ever had the ability to receive from God not brother branham them from God that you believed that we needed the message we needed this message is your release it will either bind you or loose you that's according what you do with it you can make it a book a rules you can make it all kind of things but it's not a book of rules this message is the revelation of Jesus Christ no shadow brother branham and having to preach to a world of different people than everything but what did he make a statement one time he said you don't have to tell the Holy Ghost feel woman it's wrong to wear pants that's what he said you know you know how to tell nobody's wrong no woman that's wrong cut her higher if she's ever read the Bible when she ain't never read the Bible I don't understand I don't know why a lot of things happens in life but my wife she Ward this very little lipstick or whatever this that was there this small and that was gone in a hurry but you know what I always wanted her to have long hair because I'm old school I'm old school that a woman's supposed to look like a woman and a man supposed to look like a man and I even tell it but not for the degrading but telling it for the truth the girls that were wrong living prostitutes as we call them red light things in my day had long hair why because they knew what a woman's supposed to look like right I mean you go walking in Walmart and there's a little divider then you look up there and here's one wall this way the one wall that way with a door well you know I don't have to be able to read they're still doing that at least they're trying to change all that but you don't have to walk over my eyesight is getting so bad I can't make out that little letter does that say men you understand welcoming that I look at the Sun the sun's got a dress on it I know which bathroom to go into without having the ability to read I thought we were Christians brother Adam never had to come to tell us to get rid of you didn't have to tell me to quit drinking that's what people are saying boy when I come in this message man I was s nothing and I quit that drinking I quit that smoking I quit that chew and I didn't do it was I saved all the time I know a wooden we got no arguments there I know it wasn't what is that your thoughts Dakota I don't drink I don't smoke I don't you try must be saved see that ain't even a good old testing with Christian little only knew he said whoa okay I'm just trying to explain what this prophet done you think about how hard he had to preach and wouldn't it wouldn't it a shame what he would say he said I come back every year Tabernacle now I come back every year and finds you going worse and worse and worse glory hallelujah we ready for rapture holiday menu here brother branham I mean I don't I shouldn't say a lot of things that I do and I'll keep on saying it I guess and stay in trouble look you hear I'm at the Tabernacle just a hollering and screaming that run around I'm talking about some and they're the ones he's talking about right and then see he really was a prophet but see he had a message the message is what I'm getting at people is not concerned about the message they're concerned about some kind of this that or the other it's the message your prophet brought a message that will take us to the change that's what I've tried to get you to say take us to the change of the body this message will if you just follow it it's not a book of rules it's a revelation of Jesus Christ what I said you say yeah when I heard the product I quit this not quit that well what about some of us that never done it well you're just the oddball I agree thank God for the oddballs I can at least say it I never did drank I didn't do those things like that people say they done and got delivered uh thank God for deliverance I ain't preaching against it I'm preaching what truth is a lot what we say bread around took away from us was things in order been gone for we heard of him I come out of the Baptist Church where they wouldn't allow preachers to be married trust I love a Baptist Church women didn't go to church with shorts on and pants and tight see we've had a message so is the message just a book of rules rules will never change anything you will always repel against rules you know that but when that something comes within your heart that let that rule itself come within your heart then sisters you ain't got to worry thing about you higher your clothes cuz it's gonna be right I remember how they used to live like oh brother mote and I used were flat top haircuts and wait said they said daddy won't you go back and get you one in flat tops like you used to hi oh well it wouldn't matter to me but we wore them over flat tiles well bro they got the life and then saying well you know it's wrong to wear flat tops brother Mosher said well brother dales you ever heard anything brother run said about it I said well I mean I've heard him talking about higher and what it was and what to do at all but as far as a flattop I said now ducktail haircuts I can quote we that away no said wouldn't know what that was but Oh Elvis style you don't come back and duck tails we called him you know what there's making fun of us go reward him flat tire well he was searching for a quote from brother Branham you know what I done get wearing the flat top I never did quit to like this I'm a flat run flat then it run out that's why I don't have the flat top now it won't I can't stand it I go to the barbershop and it stands up we're supposed to be down and say downwards supposed to be up and it's just getting old but at least I still got so that's one thing about all right get off but now listen see the message I was talking about this morning they've been talking about the message brother Branham was too brain was to not just bring us a seven-year Liberty you know one over seven years because there's limitations in all of those seven years there's limitations in that well you go into bondage with a wife you come out you're going to bunny throughout and man give you a while you come out and wife stays and bondage that's the laws and the things there's limitations now I want to get to where they ain't no limit but to show you that it's not so perfect the Bible tells you and the Prophet says when the man goes out he goes out owing nothing I oh brother Kali a million dollars I pay him back for so many years working they need enough to start a down payment on paying him back when he can't hold that against me he lets me go free cuz that's a brother to a brother you say that's no that's not loose living that's the truth that's what God said for us to do and see then when you come down to it this life stage this messenger of this life stage the Holy Ghost at the turn of the century leading the messenger to the age I read it to you this morning when the messenger comes at the end of the age there's many times as brother Brennan said that like I told you we said in talking one day and his this minister said I just sitting there outside of him and I know he listened to my tapes because he told me did and he punished this other and said that's where they get all of this mess and you're coming at the end of the age oh brother why didn't you say something Oh same thing to it if that's all he knows that's all you know who forget it ain't gonna argue we just gotta walk off this mortises he studied the message it's kind of like that I remember one the Martin boy said it it's lady told him something and he said my lord sister he said that ain't even in the Bible she said well you ought to know it's in there somewhere cause you the preacher preacher can't put it in there you might have you find it but listen see then this life stage this message is so marvelous until it spoke of throughout the Word of God this message is this time and it's doing all right let's do that for just a little bit to see then we've got a communion go ahead with number six cause we're right back where we started with your notes if you got them we're on number six we kept these notes Leviticus 25 eight nine and I felt number seven Sabbath's of years under the seven times seven years in the space of the seven Sabbath's of years they'll be under the forty and nine years okay then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee trumpet of the Jubilee message of the release okay it's so perfect until the release is this Jubilee then shalt thou calls the trumpet that's trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month and the day of the tone will show you make trumpet sound throughout that word is taken the Hebrew lexicon number 86 43 and you know they got it go ahead it's number seven that little work jubilee look what it means let's remember soul eat a release but look what it goes back to an alarm a signal a sound of Tempest shout that's the words you believe it means shout shout blast of war or alarm joy alarm of wars in other words a battle cry applies a shout of joy with the religious impulse shout of joy in general the word Jubilee which is a release it literally means a shout because somebody's got to proclaim it if it ain't proclaimed we can't celebrate it now I said this morning so let's go to that go to Joshua we'll go to number eight and let's read this Joshua 633 216 you can now you know what if this is when they come up to Jericho and the children of Israel was facing to the walls of Jericho go around about the city once I shall do six days when they got there look what they've done now usually seven church ages here's your perfect message and everything laying in order right in the Old Testament what did Joshua would do that far but it wasn't Joshua it was God telling him to go out there circle the city go back and camp next day circle the city go back and count next day circle the city you've done it for six days now we're gonna read it in the seventh day you went seven times see thirsty Church ages topped out showing you an example alright and seven priests Serge's messengers shall buy before the ark seven trumpets of ram horns and the seventh day you shall come pass the city seven times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn and when you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall ascend every man straight way up in other words go straight so he's gonna go six then the seventh you gonna go seven times we just keep reading down with you can follow it it'll come right down to showing you the touch shout bring it on up to the next one you can read all this in between it came to pass when Joshua was spoken under the people and watch him the Joshua's got to have a message all right cuz this prophet had a message Joshua had a message from God to tell him what to do how to do it everything he tells it to the people but the people came to say you know where's he tells them they would you shout when I shout another word well they didn't this jump up run over hey know everything had to be in perfect order they had to make the perfect amount of times they had two sets plays in order and then they got ready okay and Joshua commanded the people saying you shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout then shall you shout yeah it's nothing just oh we got it we're know the Prophet said I'll tell you what to do if we'd listened to the Prophet we wouldn't have to worry about all the other thing he rose up early in the priest an arc and he read it and they been when they did when they began to blow and all the others the walls went straight down now I I could think of it like this the prophets message is what's going to take Babylon down take things out of our lives take things away from us that are sinful and life of us living in things when we get the revelation of what the man is saying he brought us the message to tell us the freedom the release the things it would be his message you know what I love about brother Brown have you ever thought about really the word he's made one day where would a man have a right to come up and make a statement like this he said now listen I say this so and so he said now you say what I say you remember that he said you say what I say he said cause I'm responsible do you realize well I'll give an example you realize in brother runs early ministry that he talked to white horse rider was the Holy Ghost am i right did he do that you realize that somebody dirt never heard any difference than that never couldn't get ahold of no message that explained any of it you know what they could go around and they could say the white horse rider is the Holy Ghost now God is not going to hold that person responsible until he hears truth what about a man had that much of a say-so with God until he could say you say what I say because I will be held accountable there gonna be a lot of people there that you're thinking you don't be there because it's gonna be a lot of people that are that you think turned away from the message and went away maybe they never heard the truth don't throw stones what is that saying he who lives in the Glass House don't still throw stones you know the message Joshua commanded the people there is his message he commanded the people and told him said now don't you shout until I tell you huh he said but when I tell you you shout and go straight forward because God has given you the city well then like I've always said wouldn't it be something they said they can run chariot races over the walls and the things you know all around there wouldn't it be something that the enemy's setting up right of life and said they went around here seven times more they wore out everything seven times today for some reason now they're all out there hollering about that time the wall gives away and it's gone because it literally went straight down and then they just went straight ahead because they was doing what the messenger saying now we'll do that it'll take care of a lot of things all right now watch the word the word Jubilee is shout Joshua tells them to shout all right go ahead to the two number nine and look what the scripture says just we say unto thee by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them around then which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first now the Lord Himself descends what did the Prophet say that it was he said the shout is the message the shout is a message the Lord himself shall descend in this message that's what he done he descended to earth in this message the Prophet brought the message to show that God had descended when God descended now remember I'm quoting brother Branham he said Jesus does all three in his descending alright who was it descended not brother Branham he had the job to do they had to be a man understand there but he had to let God bring the message God delivered it to him then he delivered it to us like it says in Joshua there they then when the people say what the prophets say it walls is coming down when the people say what the Prophet says the walls is coming down the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a message are you looking for the coming of the Lord I think you're in bad shape the Lord descended in this message that we have in our possession that was his descending that was his coming in the message not the man coming thank God that had to be a man that had to be a messenger but the Lord Himself descended when he said for it first thing comes when he starts descending from heaven there's a shout what is it he's a message to get two people together the message comes forth to get two people together a shout and a voice and a trumpet shout a messenger getting the people ready all these is taking off the rapture message to get two people ready therefore the message calls the bride together see the shout and the trumpet in the same one he was allowed the same one he with a loud voice he screamed out with that shout and a voice and waken Lazarus now if you'd have been standing with Jesus you would have heard him say Lazarus come forth right that would have been his word but what was really bringing Lazarus from the grave the god that was standing there God was standing there in a body rock the Lord had descended from heaven you're looking for the coming of the Lord you're in your you're missing the whole point now don't misunderstand that and throw me in the wrong degree if you're looking for his descending you've missed the message of the hour because that's where he descended is there anything outside this message can you show me anything else outside of this message that is to be done come on here this message is the shout it's the Jubilee it's the release it's what sets us free is this message he didn't bind us like somebody said one time they said well I'd tell that person off but I'm a Christian I'm late that ain't it Christian you just said the wrong thing to me that ain't a Christian I tell him off I wasn't a Christian I just walk brother Colley I wasn't a Christian no we're supposed to protect him it's just whooping it right see this message is what I'm trying to get you to say and then Watchers why is it that we can't read and believe what we read well I've been believing this making a long time then see it produce you're in bad shape don't talk to me about that this message won't produce we've seen the dead raised we've seen their sick healed we've seen times right but I don't mind telling you have no problem then people run over the RC the city on the dead raisin that's no problem I don't degrade nobody or try to prop up something this message church is what I'm trying to get you to say we have within our possession I know I shouldn't say that I'm sorry how many of you have an ability to hear ever sermon brother branham it's preached how many of you can say that you heard basically ever sir we've got the message now I'm beta Proclamation while ago for next Sunday services it will be dealing for the future home now read anything you won't - because that's what forgets people you say I want you to listen to that tape bless good I'll listen any tape I won't true now don't tell me you're a Christian there's something wrong with your mentality let alone your Christianity and I've had people to throw stuff like like I don't have time for that like broke said one time this man who said some doing me he said he said brother said I preached on that said I got about 65 sermons are the priests own it and he did a statue a perfect man this brother said I ain't got time less than 65 messages well the Moke said you've been listening all this year and don't know nothing yet your change things around he was a little more sterner than I am and when he would say that but you understand why I'm good it's not to know who's gonna be pressed in it's not to know all about this that or the other all of these things is to know this message we have the message of eternal life there is no message nowhere outside of this message that has eternal life in it this message because this message is the shout the Jubilee the release you know stay a little while you know when Psalms where the where it says the Lord will go up with a shout and that'll be the background for next week it says the Lord she'll go up with a shout boy if he's waiting on somebody to shout and see I never have believed if that shout there was a holler you know what I mean if God told Joshua what to do go around the wall go around the wall do this then and sit stand and look at the wall noise and said just when I say shout you shout and go straight forward because the Lord has given you the CD do you think it was just a shower to hover yeah and the walls go for you could it really be when the people believes Joshua was the leader they saved a lot of problems and the people of this message if they believe brother branham is the leader because it would change the motor situations but the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout then that means he's here word yeah you'll never see him that away with that attitude you'll never see God but I thought we were supposed to believe for the impossible I thought we were supposed to believe the impossible see this message is the Sabbath's Jubilee released the trumpet the trumpet is already sounded letter Brennan said on [Music] 10 virgins and pretty sure he said a gospel trumpet when he says the trumpet life he said a gospel Trump and her son well like I've always said you mean the deads gonna be raised and walk among us we'll get together and we're as dead as we are today who won't even say Amen at least you could say old me right I mean and what throwing off on you yeah throwing off on all of us they were not I'm not looking for some kind of a message I'm not looking for something to take place I believe the message is here if there is anything else it will have to be brought by the message it can't be brought any other way than by the message that the very prophet brought unto us well I'm looking for this brother Dale I'm looking for that all right ain't gonna argue with you but it's just like I said are you looking for the coming of the Lord or have you seen the Lord descend and we're talking to people that set tower with the Prophet when he was preaching right are you still looking for something to take place or can you say the message has already come we at least have the message right because the Lord Himself has descended with the Jubilee time a shout and it ties together all the way through the Old Testament of their releases and things to tie to the church age releases ties down to the end time to work that there's a messenger comes that's the Holy Ghost to bring the Azusa Street message and then the Prophet steps on the scene with his message and declares Liberty you remember the other when I said I'm free that's what I'm talking about I'm free from any thoughts or ideas of trying anything else beside this message because I have no vote for know ourselves what about your salvation minds based upon one time is this profit right sort of toes and brothers were sitting down the stars are one day talking about something I said well I'm gonna tell you this like it is because it is where I stand if the Prophet said it I believe it I'll stand behind it but if he didn't say it that's this questions and answers and things we can discuss well you don't want me to you know what I didn't say nothing about I said that's where I stand this message is right it is the descendant of God I'm not looking for God to come you ever heard your prophet say I'm not looking for him to come I'm saying he's coming he said I'm saying he's here we know what may not have been to nobody in the world but it was to him he wasn't looking for something out there that's what caught my attention when I first heard him and heard the way of talking I've been through the philosophies of mankind and their teachings and ideas you know but I heard a man talk about a Living God we looked out well hopefully we will maybe we will I hope we're saying you ain't never heard people talk like that I believe I'm saved well when is it going to turn from belief into a fact the Lord has already descended with this message now I'm going to make these statements for the next service is coming on next week I don't want to make complain even to the people of this message they say Jesus come in three sons 9 our God come in three sons now son of man son of God son of David and that's right but here comes a prophet is the one that had taught us that over and over and over and one day he seemed something and he said right in between this coming of the Son of God down through the church ages and the son of David said comes forth the Son of Man you remember unveiling of God he's saying something when he gets to the future home is reading I'm asking you to read it he's bringing that message down so perfect and he's bringing it down he brings that seven he nails it down he gets it all nailed down and he's got that seven he's got that millennium and he plainly says something to this degree where do we go now because that's as far as he could see was the son of David sitting on the throne in the Millennium and he says we're missing it I'm just paraphrasing his words we read or listen we're missing it we're not seeing eternal life because the millennium is still under time and as long as you're under time you're not in eternity he says you're still under a seven he's because the seven is the seventh day out of Eden as I saying this morning that were God worked six days and rested the seventh seeing fell we fell in the seventh we fell into rest the Prophet said God is going to bring back that thousand years to prove that somebody's going to live a thousand years without dying he said to prove the sin curse is gone glory hallelujah it takes more to come there's more to come scriptures don't worry about it just listen and if you miss the services I ask you to please get too tight you miss the service there's some reason get the tape and listen to it you owe yourself you owe me that much because I'm going to be blown about something that the Lord showed me that's going to tie it all together if we keep dealing with a seven we're left in time and there's no rapture there was no rapture down through seven Church ages what about well you just got me start up good maybe you'll go listen because the main thing is if you listen to the message the future home and just listen to it over and over or read it and listen how he goes and lays it down and he gets it right up to a 7 and stops he said now brother branham said you've come to a 7 he said where are you going from here I'll see mankind have never taught nothing beyond that he said oh I'm not out of the scripture yet you remember that he said I've got another day well how do you think people felt it was sitting there another day after the 7th we got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 another day if you'll remember this it'll help you if you've got another day you've got a high of another part of your message and I've done that deliberately of what I say it because Rutter insame see starts back here and comes all the way through ok no problem then which you've got to have somewhere to put that now listen you think it I I preached it up to where the three sons nice and I done knew that I preached that 40 years ago three sons night and then here comes son of man in between son of God and Son of David to be able to transfer over to the Millennium now he's opened up from dark to the future home but I want you to think about it I want you to think about what could be between now and the future home what could be between the millennium and the future home it's in the future home brother Owen said now listen to his work he said there'll be things in the Millennium that won't be in the future home find that quote and read real careful around it there'll be things in the Millennium that will not be in the future I see we're not ending the message that's what everybody thinks so we're in the message we understand do you understand well why do we need to well are you not going to the Millennium don't you want to know where it's at and what's going on before you get there I mean it you know you're going to to Warm Springs and you say well we're going to one frame and I said well which way is it I don't know I'm just going well what's that I don't know I'm just going I've heard a warm spring I'm going to one front well where are you going I don't know you don't fly I don't know that's how blind we are spiritually speaking sorry how blind we are spiritually speaking at least we could be familiar with what the prophet has to say but I've never expected a hundred percent of the people to listen to the future home before next Sunday I just know yeah I know you're gonna let everything else get into what and I didn't have time don't use excuses boys that brother Colley he spoke on that one time the excuses this one something is it things that we use when we need them something to that degree honor excuses is what we need we do we use them when we need them you know what about it let's stand together the brothers would get to Communion ready they're saying I love him while they're getting everything finished and then we'll go into the communion in the foot washing mm-hmm [Music] be calm Seifer love to be and / just smile salvation uncle if you need healing saying it this way he become ether and by his stripes I'm healed completely now what about it you have a need and it's taking these two a sum of our kin folks she's got a lot of nerve problems and things is bothering her so let's just pray and believe it you take these prayer cloths and give them to him and we believe it that God will touch her we don't seem to be too many times my father in the name of Jesus Christ you brought up on the heart of our daughter to pray for this lady Lord we ask you to just reach down touch take away all the problems and the things that are nervous be settled and all be well we love you and we think in Jesus name anybody else that have a need before we do the communion let's go to first Corinthians then at 11:23 I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do use often often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat it home that you come not together under condemnation the restroom I said in order when I come so let's just take a few moments of salat prayer praying one for the other the Lord would help us all
