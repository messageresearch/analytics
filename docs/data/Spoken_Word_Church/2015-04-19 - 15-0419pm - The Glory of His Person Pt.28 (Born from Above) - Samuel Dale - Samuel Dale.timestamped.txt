[0:00] the money collected you all have done a
[0:03] wonderful job as a church we're going to
[0:05] start allocating These funds
[0:08] we've far surpassed the need
[0:10] for those few things so we've collected
[0:13] as a church this has nothing to do with
[0:16] the church funds this is what you have
[0:17] handed me and I put in my pocket
[0:19] Hallelujah
[0:21] fifty four hundred and ten dollars as of
[0:24] this morning
[0:28] thank you and I don't have anything but
[0:31] candy in my pocket so the show for it
[0:34] fifty four hundred and ten dollars plus
[0:36] the church is sending three thousand
[0:37] dollars to build that addition to that
[0:40] church so that's going to be 8 410 we're
[0:44] going to send over there to
[0:48] my
[0:50] oh and we're we're sending brother Leto
[0:53] we're sending him a hundred dollars a
[0:54] month the one I told you that did all
[0:56] the work in Palawan actually
[0:59] praise God I got an email from Brother
[1:02] uh
[1:03] um what's your
[1:05] brother Royal thank you got an email
[1:07] from Brother Royal Friday they went back
[1:10] over to Palawan and baptized three
[1:12] denominational pastors out of that
[1:15] meeting so thank God for that
[1:18] and they're going back in a week or the
[1:21] next week and they're going to preach in
[1:22] those three denominational churches the
[1:24] message of the hour so that's wonderful
[1:27] hey 3 out of 15.
[1:30] that's wonderful and that's just
[1:31] something that has has immediately said
[1:34] they wanted to be baptized and wanted to
[1:35] hear the message of the hour so out of
[1:37] that 60 60 denominational people 15
[1:40] contacted them back three of them's been
[1:42] baptized already so just keep praying
[1:44] that those full churches and then
[1:48] according to your help we're going to
[1:49] send them this is a way that that that I
[1:52] think we should do it just I want to get
[1:54] it approved by you but they only needed
[1:57] 15 tablets well we got enough what you
[1:59] handed me to send them 26 tablets so
[2:02] we're going to send them 26 tablets and
[2:04] they can distribute that out to the uh
[2:07] to the brothers over there
[2:09] and to whoever they see fit but also we
[2:11] have that one for the brother Edwards
[2:13] church and there's another brother Rudy
[2:16] that needs about twelve hundred dollars
[2:17] well if we give him that to finish his
[2:19] church because his church is finished in
[2:21] the front but it's totally open in the
[2:23] back there's nothing there's no wall
[2:25] there's no anything and they still have
[2:26] church service so brother Royal said if
[2:29] you we could allocate 1200 of that which
[2:32] still leaves
[2:34] 310 dollars left over that we ain't got
[2:37] anything to give to so I'm just going to
[2:39] send it over there and tell them to use
[2:40] it as they see fit but I want to thank
[2:42] you as a church percent for giving me
[2:45] personally fifty four hundred and ten
[2:46] dollars besides what the church is going
[2:48] to send over that but God bless you if
[2:50] anybody else wants to give anything

[22:05] that we Fellowship together and had a
[22:08] good time in the Lord just sitting
[22:10] around fellowshipping together you know
[22:13] I like that all right scripture reading
[22:16] Revelations 1
[22:18] 12-15 and the same as we read this
[22:21] morning John 3 1 through 10. father we
[22:25] thank you for your grace thank you for
[22:29] everything Lord
[22:31] thank you that Lord you would give an
[22:35] opportunity to a group of people to be
[22:38] able to hear your word
[22:40] and that we could accept that and
[22:43] believe that you're speaking to us and
[22:45] about us and directing Us in the light
[22:49] of your love and your grace here in the
[22:51] end time
[22:52] we pray that you would hasten the day to
[22:55] finish all of this up
[22:57] because we're not glorying in trying to
[23:00] end all things because we know the
[23:03] horrible things that goes with it but we
[23:05] glory in the fact that we will be with
[23:08] thee and gathered around the throne to
[23:10] be your people we thank him we love you
[23:13] Lord we ask you to just bless
[23:16] and guide each one now and keep us in
[23:20] Jesus name
[23:28] we've been reading Revelations one here
[23:30] for a while
[23:31] and I turned to see the voice that spoke
[23:34] with me and being turned I saw seven
[23:36] golden candlesticks
[23:38] and in the midst of the seven
[23:40] candlesticks One Life unto the son of
[23:42] man
[23:43] clothed the Garment down to the foot and
[23:45] gird about the pouch with a golden
[23:47] girdle his head and his hires were white
[23:49] like wool as white as snow in his eyes
[23:52] where's the flame of fire
[23:54] and his feet likened to find Bryce as if
[23:57] they burned in a furnace and his voice
[24:00] says to sound many Waters all right
[24:03] we thank the Lord for
[24:05] showing us the truth of
[24:08] that we can read the book of Revelations
[24:10] and understand it
[24:12] and go back then and tie it together
[24:14] with all the others so we'll go to John
[24:17] 3
[24:19] . there was a man of the Pharisees named
[24:22] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same
[24:24] came to Jesus by night and said unto him
[24:27] Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[24:29] come from God for no man can do these
[24:32] Miracles that thou has that thou doest
[24:34] except God be with him and Jesus
[24:37] answered and said unto him verily verily
[24:39] I say unto thee except a man be born
[24:42] again he cannot see the kingdom of God
[24:45] Nicodemus saith unto him how can a man
[24:47] be born when he is old
[24:49] can he enter the second time into his
[24:51] mother's womb and be born and Jesus
[24:54] answered verily verily I say unto thee
[24:57] except a man be born of water and of the
[25:00] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[25:03] of God that which is born to the flesh
[25:06] his flesh and that which is born of the
[25:09] spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say
[25:12] it unto thee you must be born again you
[25:16] may be seated the Lord add his Blessing
[25:18] to the reading of the word now
[25:24] I pray that you'll
[25:27] help me and we'll carry on and go
[25:29] through the service this afternoon
[25:31] and doing it like some of them said it'd
[25:33] be hard to stay awake because of eating
[25:36] so much and things and and all like that
[25:38] well if you do we'll just take a break
[25:40] I'll just take a nap with you and we'll
[25:43] finish up and
[25:44] get through with all things that was a
[25:47] wonderful meal we really appreciate it
[25:50] we have some of the best cooks in the
[25:52] world and I don't say that with any
[25:55] reserve or throwing off on anybody else
[25:58] it's just I believe it that we do and
[26:01] and to appreciate the getting together
[26:03] and and fellowshipping around the food
[26:06] now
[26:08] we were speaking this morning of why
[26:11] you must be born again
[26:14] all right
[26:15] seemingly like a very simple message but
[26:18] remember the prophet in his explain
[26:21] explaining it he said it was a deep
[26:24] thought
[26:26] because it was his first Doctrine the
[26:29] first message that he brought of you
[26:32] know showing there was other little
[26:33] things happened you know and the
[26:35] different parts of doings but as far as
[26:39] a sermon that was his first sermon to
[26:42] tell a bunch of religious people
[26:46] who no marks against him or you could
[26:50] have killed them in a lot of situations
[26:51] especially the high priest
[26:54] um the things like that that you could
[26:56] put in the line there to spend years
[26:59] speaking about
[27:02] and as I said this morning then him uh
[27:05] bragging so much on Jesus that we know
[27:09] that you've got to be of God
[27:12] and yet after it was all finished
[27:16] I believe if he'd have said to Nicodemus
[27:19] he said now Nicodemus you're a good man
[27:22] and what you need to do is you need to
[27:24] you need to give a big offer into the
[27:27] church
[27:28] you know
[27:30] well he would have probably just whipped
[27:31] out his
[27:33] you know money and laid it down
[27:35] wouldn't have been any problem if it
[27:38] would have been anything to have done
[27:39] without for a month or whatever to do
[27:42] you know he would have been Overjoyed to
[27:45] do that
[27:47] but when a man would tell you that you
[27:49] thought you were I mean tell you and you
[27:52] thinking that you were born correct
[27:55] and I've always since I've heard the
[27:58] prophet's message and begin to
[28:00] understand the serpent seed and you know
[28:02] the seed of the serpent the things
[28:04] and in reading the Bible
[28:08] I believe those Pharisees knew what
[28:10] happened in the garden
[28:12] I don't think they were blind to a lot
[28:15] of the things that we speak of
[28:17] even with the the man that was up at
[28:19] brother biscoll's and he said
[28:23] um the garden and the act of
[28:26] of uh you know
[28:28] taking place in the garden he said
[28:31] that's known you thought
[28:33] he said but to think about something
[28:35] like that it was the Beast you know and
[28:37] Eve he said that gives us something to
[28:40] think about you know I believe they
[28:42] understood because they would say to
[28:44] Jesus we're not born a fornication
[28:48] and why would they lay so heavily on the
[28:52] fact of circumcision
[28:55] and the realization as we were talking
[28:57] to the sister last night about it the in
[29:00] the realization that was placed upon
[29:02] mankind the doings and the things and
[29:05] how and then to turn around and
[29:07] eventually tell the man that the man had
[29:09] to be circumcised
[29:10] you know
[29:12] well then it you know everything mounts
[29:14] up to the situation of seeing that
[29:17] they're all related together and I I
[29:20] believe it I mean I'm honest I believe
[29:22] that that
[29:24] when you know they knew that that and
[29:28] they I believe they believed that
[29:29] circumcision
[29:31] brother Brown said that old Jew would
[29:33] tell you said now you know I'll just
[29:34] take you and show you
[29:36] you know he believed in it he had ever
[29:39] hoped he had laid on it other sign of
[29:42] circumcision because he wouldn't dilate
[29:44] his child go without it being
[29:46] circumcised you remember that even when
[29:48] Abraham going down you know I mean not
[29:51] Abraham um Moses going down you know and
[29:54] was fixing to leave because he'd kind of
[29:56] drifted away from the strict point of
[29:58] doing of following the traditions and he
[30:02] was getting ready to go down take over
[30:04] to Egypt and hadn't even circumcised his
[30:06] own son you know and and the angel was
[30:10] fixing to kill him
[30:11] and you said well it wouldn't have
[30:13] killed
[30:15] I wouldn't want to argue with an angel
[30:17] Lord do you you know I'm not going to
[30:20] say you're not going to kill me I don't
[30:22] know I'm not going to argue with him and
[30:24] uh
[30:25] see but he had to perform the sign of
[30:27] circumcision
[30:29] that was a very different thing you
[30:32] remember in the time there that one of
[30:35] the girls uh was uh you know taken by an
[30:40] outsiding country man a different
[30:43] group and you remember and he wanted her
[30:47] for a wife
[30:48] well you know they agreed he did the man
[30:52] did to kind of let it be okay because
[30:54] you know I do but they made a
[30:56] stipulation
[30:57] sit down the only way that you'll ever
[30:59] showing you the very importance of what
[31:01] they thought of is it the only way
[31:03] you'll ever settle this case now
[31:06] the daughter the old man you remember
[31:08] told who that Jacob forever which one of
[31:10] it was the No Man's Daddy he said but
[31:13] y'all gonna have to be circumcised
[31:16] that was a Shameless disgrace well you
[31:19] know how they done and more boys kind of
[31:22] used the time and they circumcised all
[31:25] those people well they just went in
[31:27] there while they were sore and having
[31:28] trouble they just went in there killed
[31:30] all of them well the daddy was upset
[31:32] about it but he kind of got over it
[31:34] because he knew that really they was
[31:36] right
[31:37] you know but that they laid so much
[31:39] honor so much on that circumcision I
[31:43] believe now this is me okay I'll tell
[31:45] you when I it's when I say I believe
[31:47] something I will definitely tell you I
[31:50] believe it all right I believe that
[31:53] they believed that circumcision done
[31:56] away with the
[31:57] seed of the serpent
[32:00] because it would have been a cleansing
[32:02] Factor
[32:04] in the things you know of doing and now
[32:06] that's just personal you take whatever
[32:08] you want to about it I've never read or
[32:10] run around said that but I never read
[32:13] where he didn't say it so all right
[32:15] definitely he said to be my idea
[32:18] but the point is telling religious
[32:21] leaders
[32:22] who believed in their uh at least their
[32:26] following of traditions and the
[32:29] following of the letter of the word
[32:31] until they believed that they were pure
[32:34] and righteous
[32:38] they believed they were right
[32:40] they would believe that they were and
[32:42] you know what they were the chosen
[32:45] people of God
[32:47] Jesus never argued with him about it he
[32:50] praised them for that point and saying
[32:53] that that's who they were
[32:55] they were the people of God all right
[32:57] and the thing that made it bad was when
[33:00] they turned down the god of the word
[33:02] that they claimed to be following would
[33:04] then naturally you know he had to turn
[33:07] against them
[33:08] but now you think about it
[33:11] great religious leader but tell that
[33:13] religious leader something he'd never
[33:15] thought of in his life
[33:18] he had studied the word
[33:21] and I remember listening to those
[33:23] Brothers
[33:25] uh from when brother biscal had him up
[33:28] there from Rabbi Richmond and gershom
[33:30] Solomon and I picked up a thought
[33:33] through that
[33:34] they
[33:36] uh studied a lot of things
[33:40] and talking to brother Bissell and them
[33:42] about what they had said see those
[33:45] people were not just sitting down every
[33:47] day reading and reading and reading
[33:50] they've done that yeah but they
[33:53] talked about things
[33:56] and discuss the things among themselves
[34:00] you know of what the Bible was talking
[34:02] about and like I said if if Jesus would
[34:05] have asked Nicodemus Nicodemus will you
[34:08] give me all the scriptures pertaining to
[34:10] the coming of the Messiah he would have
[34:12] just rolled them off
[34:14] you know he would have went right
[34:16] through the the Virgin conceiving it
[34:19] went right through you know the things
[34:20] that would have been there because they
[34:23] understood that they were looking
[34:25] forward to that
[34:27] all right and you know that would be
[34:30] their their point
[34:32] but yet he didn't say it like that
[34:35] he said you must be born again
[34:37] all right
[34:39] then in saying it like that we know that
[34:43] why we must be born again as we talked
[34:45] about this morning then what that we
[34:47] were born a hybrid condition from Eve
[34:50] sin and the sin was between Satan and
[34:53] Eve that brought the fall
[34:56] and that was the worser part of it than
[34:59] it actually the ACT between the Beast
[35:01] and Eve to bring forth Cain see the
[35:05] worst part was the uh the fact of Eve
[35:09] receiving the unbelief
[35:11] and then when she does even Paul comes
[35:14] on later that Satan might not tempt us
[35:18] as he did through Eve through his
[35:20] satility it was a warning there all
[35:23] right
[35:23] and in doing that
[35:27] it put us in a place called Death
[35:31] right
[35:32] now then until something took place to
[35:37] change that
[35:39] it didn't matter how good you were
[35:42] in the Old Testament remember they went
[35:45] to a place called
[35:47] Paradise when they died
[35:49] all right
[35:51] now in going to that place of paradise
[35:54] it was a place of the bosom of Abraham
[35:57] as we call it scripturally
[35:59] all right not meaning the badly or the
[36:02] inwards of Abraham it was the faith of
[36:05] Abraham it was Abraham's belief in God
[36:08] it provided a place to work that they
[36:12] would have a place to abide all right
[36:15] when they passed away because they're
[36:18] all looking forward as we're reading a
[36:20] little bit they were looking to the
[36:22] cross
[36:23] right
[36:24] and that was wonderful they had the
[36:27] blood of bulls and goats to cover for
[36:29] their sins
[36:30] they had the atonements to be made
[36:33] they had all of that but see you and I
[36:36] are not looking say to the cross I love
[36:38] the way run around and said it I'll read
[36:40] it he said they look to the cross
[36:43] he said we look through the cross
[36:46] now what does he mean
[36:49] see now you got to answer something what
[36:51] does it mean
[36:54] see you would probably say looking
[36:57] through the cross
[36:59] no see to me it doesn't matter if I look
[37:01] back that way I can see the beginning if
[37:04] I look through the cross
[37:05] I can see the atonement I can see all
[37:08] that took place back there
[37:10] back through the atonement through the
[37:13] cross and that way then I can surely
[37:15] know where we are now
[37:17] so it was a great way for him to say it
[37:20] I remember that thought it thought I
[37:22] mean I sometimes it amazes me I wish I
[37:24] could talk like he did I'm kind of like
[37:27] that fella you know about the
[37:29] when the atom bomb went off and a great
[37:31] big smoke went up and the old Indian
[37:32] talked in in sign language you know
[37:35] smoked languages and that old big that
[37:37] we ending was standing there watching
[37:39] when that great atom bomb went off and
[37:40] the great big mushroom went up he looked
[37:42] he said man I wish I'd have said that
[37:45] so I'm just kind of like that
[37:47] I wish I could say like brother Branham
[37:49] does
[37:50] because it looked like he'd say you know
[37:52] we look to the Cross or something or
[37:55] we're on the other side of the Cross
[37:56] explaining you don't go and but he said
[37:59] they looked to the Cross we looked
[38:00] through the cross what does it matter
[38:02] whether you look that away or look that
[38:03] away
[38:04] either way you're coming back to the
[38:05] beginning
[38:06] to a wonderful situation to understand
[38:09] all right but see being born between
[38:14] the mess up of Eve that brought death to
[38:17] the human race
[38:19] then no matter what
[38:22] and you'll see why that I don't agree
[38:23] with the lineages I can follow lineages
[38:26] through the Bible I can take those
[38:29] things but you know people that want to
[38:31] follow lineages
[38:32] and they want to follow it like they'll
[38:35] say whether I was Judah and Tamar to
[38:37] continue a lineage I had to continue to
[38:41] limit lineage but you know what brother
[38:43] Ryan said
[38:44] he said that was adultery
[38:47] you know what he said
[38:49] he said adultery can't be a
[38:50] predestinating seed
[38:52] now argue with him all you want to
[38:55] see it puts it in a different situation
[38:58] but it's like I said
[39:00] this morning I wouldn't care if you
[39:02] could run my lineage all the way back
[39:05] and find out I was a direct descendant
[39:07] from Cain coming down through the lines
[39:11] it wouldn't bother me at all
[39:13] because that has nothing to do
[39:16] with a new birth
[39:19] if you try to make it anything you've
[39:21] got a problem you try to make it any
[39:24] lineage is there anything you got a
[39:26] problem
[39:28] just make it where it was because you
[39:30] look back through your lineages are not
[39:32] too good
[39:34] you remember see you run around and said
[39:36] in the church age book many were the
[39:39] flaws of those coming down
[39:44] you can't find the one in there without
[39:46] flaws
[39:48] you got a problem so stay away from
[39:50] those type of things because that's why
[39:53] I said I don't agree with lineage is
[39:54] that a way to try to say that if I was
[39:57] born of a certain lineage I can be saved
[39:58] because I don't care if I could come
[40:00] directly from Cain down to where I am
[40:02] today I believe in the atonement and
[40:07] the salvation
[40:09] it is offered to all mankind
[40:12] all right
[40:13] and I believe that's why we must need to
[40:15] be born again
[40:17] see we must
[40:20] be born
[40:23] and now if you're going to be born again
[40:25] and the only one that could explain that
[40:30] uh would be the Lord Jesus himself
[40:33] all right because no one else knew how
[40:36] to explain that
[40:37] now come on the prophets themselves
[40:41] could speak of
[40:43] they could prophesy they could say the
[40:45] messiah's coming they could say the
[40:47] things the law Giver would become from
[40:49] Judah they could determine the place of
[40:52] it coming the different things but they
[40:55] not a one of those Prophets
[40:57] never come right down to speaking of
[40:59] that new birth
[41:01] even the greatest of all which was John
[41:04] the Baptist
[41:05] to receive the Holy Ghost six months
[41:08] before he's born or three months or
[41:10] something before he's born
[41:11] you know
[41:13] yet the least in the kingdom is greater
[41:15] than he
[41:18] well you know
[41:20] that doesn't belittle because he was the
[41:22] introducer
[41:24] now brother Branham coming on over on
[41:26] this side see that's why to me when it
[41:29] says you have been given a greater gifts
[41:32] you remember that
[41:34] why
[41:35] because he was a born-again believer
[41:38] whereas the other prophets were not
[41:40] I'm talking about the Old Testament now
[41:42] you're talking about Paul and coming
[41:44] down into the new
[41:46] he was a born-again Believer he was a
[41:48] church-aged messenger he was a promise
[41:51] prophet of the word
[41:54] right
[41:54] but yet he was worth nothing until he
[41:57] received that new birth
[42:01] and he was born to prophet
[42:06] but that that wouldn't have been he
[42:09] would you know there's a Doctrine not
[42:12] too far over the road over here
[42:14] that years ago was out that brother
[42:16] Branham Was An Old Testament prophet
[42:19] in the New Testament age
[42:22] although that didn't sound good you know
[42:24] I mean it is oh it is beautiful now that
[42:27] you could they could just line it up and
[42:28] and it just sounds so great
[42:31] and I thought
[42:33] an Old Testament prophet
[42:38] he'd be a lawgiver
[42:42] because it couldn't be anything else
[42:44] you put him in a new testament age
[42:47] you have a law Giver
[42:50] without salvation
[42:52] I didn't realize what they were saying
[42:54] but that's all right
[43:01] in simple terminologies do you realize
[43:03] what Jesus was saying
[43:07] he's saying that there's nothing here on
[43:09] Earth
[43:12] may I go over in the Book of Revelations
[43:14] and and declare it from there that
[43:16] there's no man worthy to take the book
[43:19] the prophets you know he said it like
[43:21] this he said the prophets were standing
[43:24] there the sages were standing there
[43:27] he says there's there was no one worthy
[43:30] to take the book
[43:31] John says all right see then there was
[43:35] no man Worthy
[43:37] or no no man that could bring a new
[43:40] birth
[43:42] it would have to be someone and the
[43:46] prophet said God came himself he didn't
[43:48] send the son all right
[43:51] now in doing that then it would come to
[43:55] the bases that no mankind is worthy
[43:59] whatsoever of performing a new birth
[44:02] even describing it
[44:05] it would take the one who could give it
[44:09] to be able to explain it
[44:12] all right and he was the only one that
[44:14] could explain it because he was the only
[44:16] one that would be able to give it
[44:17] right all right and he didn't give it
[44:20] right then when he was even explaining
[44:22] through the Matthew the mark the Luke
[44:23] the John
[44:25] he never gave the new birth right then
[44:28] he was preparing them to a place to
[44:31] receive it later
[44:33] but isn't it amazing to just think of
[44:35] the Simplicity of what it is
[44:40] he was not of this world
[44:45] Jesus Christ was not of this world sure
[44:48] he was a human being life and living
[44:50] here right okay
[44:52] but he was not of this world
[44:55] and you know what he said you're not of
[44:57] this world
[45:01] but see he was totally not of this world
[45:03] was well then would there be any problem
[45:06] when he would say
[45:08] you must be born again
[45:12] and I'm trying to lay down a situation
[45:14] with both of these messages for you to
[45:18] think
[45:19] it made it even more confusing
[45:23] to Nicodemus
[45:25] for him to say what he said
[45:29] because we read it as
[45:31] you know well it says you he said you
[45:35] must be born again
[45:39] all right but now remember what I said
[45:41] this morning
[45:43] that was what we read in What's called
[45:45] the English language
[45:49] you know
[45:53] do you know what that original says
[45:57] in the emphatic dyglot
[46:02] if not anyone may be born from above not
[46:08] is able to see the kingdom of God
[46:13] now would you understand that
[46:16] that's the original translation that's
[46:18] the original English straight in from
[46:20] from the Greek or the Hebrew average one
[46:23] of you
[46:24] because that's your reasonable see if
[46:27] not anyone may be born from above not is
[46:31] able to see the kingdom of God
[46:35] and that puts it more confusing than any
[46:37] doesn't it
[46:40] then when it was put over into the King
[46:42] James it came about except a man be born
[46:46] again
[46:47] all right now what are you saying
[46:50] brother Dale
[46:51] I believe
[46:53] no
[46:54] I know we we use other Bibles and
[46:56] reading things but that's all right
[46:59] I have as many of them as I can find
[47:03] I've actually got one book that's got 26
[47:06] translations and I'm talking about
[47:07] different translations from way back
[47:11] uh new in new English any kind of doing
[47:15] I've actually got them and I compare
[47:17] them I compare this
[47:19] and I believe it's Knox that brought the
[47:21] correct it down to where it says You
[47:23] must be born from above
[47:26] all right now that would be even more
[47:28] confusing
[47:30] as I said Nicodemus could understand him
[47:33] if he said do this give that go do this
[47:36] go do something
[47:38] he was okay
[47:41] I've been after all these other things
[47:42] might as well do that too
[47:44] you know and uh
[47:47] but when he said you must be born again
[47:49] he was literally saying You must be born
[47:52] from above
[47:56] well how would you like to explain to
[47:58] people
[48:03] how would you like to even now now we're
[48:05] not no reflection of churches
[48:07] but how would you like to explain to a
[48:09] good Baptist Church
[48:12] and tell them the original says You must
[48:14] be born from above
[48:17] without giving them a long lengthy part
[48:20] of telling them what the other
[48:22] scriptures are related
[48:26] well see it was really confusing to
[48:28] Nicodemus
[48:33] I can understand this part
[48:35] but he said from above now what's this
[48:37] guy talking about what's the problem
[48:41] see literally Jesus was saying to him
[48:45] in the completed thought that you would
[48:46] be getting
[48:47] the Nicodemus it won't do you no good to
[48:51] enter into your mother's womb and be
[48:54] born again that way I'm not talking
[48:57] about that I'm talking about that you
[49:00] must be born from above because that's
[49:04] where I came from
[49:06] and if you're going to be in anything in
[49:09] my kingdom
[49:12] because the kingdom of God
[49:15] is not anything natural
[49:19] right the disciples couldn't understand
[49:22] that now to show you how far they missed
[49:24] it what did they say
[49:26] when they got over an ax right before
[49:28] the coming of the Holy Ghost
[49:31] after they've done seen his resurrection
[49:33] after they've done seen all other things
[49:34] what did he say
[49:36] are you going to restore the kingdom to
[49:38] Israel at this time
[49:40] they still had their thoughts after
[49:43] following Jesus for three and a half
[49:44] years and seeing him raised and seeing
[49:47] all the things that had happened they
[49:49] still were thinking as the prophet said
[49:51] of a natural Kingdom
[49:53] they thought that they were that Jesus
[49:55] was going to throw the Romans off and
[49:57] take over and and they'd be victorious
[50:01] right
[50:03] so I'm getting it to a point to try to
[50:05] get you to think of really it is mass
[50:08] confusion to the human mind
[50:11] truly as we get to it in a minute the
[50:13] prophet will say the new birth is a
[50:15] mystery
[50:18] truly it is a mystery
[50:21] how can we Earthly people
[50:25] be born from another world
[50:29] are we in a Superman situation
[50:33] was this Jesus like Superman that all
[50:36] the kids would know about
[50:39] that he came from this planet of Krypton
[50:41] and he came down with superhuman powers
[50:44] and you know the X-ray Visions the
[50:47] faster than the speeding bullets you
[50:49] know able to leak buildings with a
[50:51] single bound you know
[50:55] you know what though those people picked
[50:58] that idea up from Jesus coming
[51:03] because Superman come from another world
[51:05] and Jesus seemed to be saying he was
[51:07] coming from another world and you know
[51:09] what he did
[51:12] and he says you can't see
[51:15] you can't understand the kingdom
[51:18] and if you can't understand it then the
[51:20] other part of the scripture will be
[51:21] right you can't enter
[51:24] you can't enter the kingdom
[51:26] unless you're born again
[51:28] unless you're born from above
[51:32] unless you have a supernatural birth
[51:36] it wouldn't have helped Nicodemus to
[51:38] went back 10 times to his mom's wound
[51:41] they would not have changed nothing
[51:46] but for him to think about
[51:50] this man
[51:51] we know
[51:53] that God is with him
[51:55] we know he's done these miracles
[51:58] we know that no man can do those things
[52:02] but now he's speaking languages that we
[52:05] have no ability to understand
[52:09] let me see if I can find one
[52:12] that I loved when I was looking at it uh
[52:22] yeah um Brothers go up to quote number
[52:25] eight
[52:28] quote number eight
[52:31] which is why I'm against organized
[52:34] religion
[52:35] of 1962
[52:37] 1111 e
[52:39] paragraph one one one Drew one one three
[52:42] and look what he says Rolling On Up
[52:47] the art of Master in Israel
[52:49] and can't even understand what the new
[52:53] birth is
[52:55] now watch what he puts it on the reason
[52:57] he don't understand
[53:02] what if you have if you would have kept
[53:06] away from them traditions
[53:10] and held onto the word
[53:15] you'd have known that I was coming
[53:19] to give men New Birth
[53:26] the letter had already declared it
[53:29] Ezekiel speaks of the new heart the new
[53:31] spirit the new thing Moses spoke of the
[53:34] inward man Solomon to Davis the Psalms
[53:37] and writings
[53:40] right
[53:42] and look
[53:43] you'd have known I was coming to give
[53:45] new men New Birth you'd have knowed my
[53:48] day
[53:50] and if you're a node Moses
[53:53] you to have knowed me
[53:55] Moses spoke of me and said I would come
[53:58] and here I am
[54:01] what about it
[54:03] if you'd have stayed away from the
[54:05] traditions
[54:07] the doctrines the ideas of mankind
[54:11] you would have known that I was coming
[54:15] to give man a new birth
[54:18] now listen real careful because of what
[54:20] I was speaking of the other week
[54:22] those Jews knew of his coming
[54:27] right
[54:29] they knew it was coming
[54:31] they knew the prophecies
[54:33] and one group had it figured out he's
[54:35] coming this way another group hadn't
[54:37] figured out coming this way they had all
[54:39] kind of ways figured out one group had
[54:41] him come in maybe as a baby another
[54:43] group having him coming as a grown man
[54:45] all kind of different situations
[54:48] because they knew about that
[54:50] but not a one of them
[54:52] knew his real purpose
[54:59] was to give his own life
[55:03] they didn't know that
[55:05] they didn't know that he was coming to
[55:07] give his own life
[55:08] and that was the only way that they
[55:10] could be anything was to be
[55:13] born again
[55:16] and born from where he was born from
[55:19] because that's what we are you want
[55:21] scripture
[55:22] does it not say it that when you receive
[55:25] the new birth does not Paul emphatically
[55:28] state that you are now
[55:30] what resurrected sitting in Heavenly
[55:34] places
[55:36] in Christ Jesus
[55:40] the prophet said you're already
[55:44] right but that's the inward man right
[55:47] it's not the outward Parts not the body
[55:49] and spirit
[55:50] that's the soul of mankind
[55:53] see we're going to get into these things
[55:54] but the main things that I'm wanting you
[55:57] to follow me
[56:00] is to look at
[56:02] this the point
[56:05] of the things
[56:06] talked about by the prophet
[56:09] that relates to it to show why this is
[56:13] and then you'll go back to your original
[56:15] and look if you've got a Scofield bible
[56:17] you just uh look over in the middle
[56:19] about halfway down your line and you'll
[56:23] see this is it means
[56:25] born from above
[56:28] is the original translation
[56:32] born from where God came from
[56:38] I remember brother moak used to preach
[56:39] on a message years ago
[56:42] and how that what was it now
[56:44] Heaven and Earth kissed you know that in
[56:47] the scripture
[56:50] when God and man become one upon Earth
[56:54] Heaven and Earth kissed and embraced I
[56:57] used to enjoy that I can still remember
[56:58] a lot of messages but let's just read a
[57:02] few because I don't want you to think
[57:04] it's just my thoughts and that I could
[57:07] read something and you could read
[57:08] something from the Greek to say this or
[57:11] something like that but to try to get
[57:13] the thought or concept of something into
[57:17] your mind is my goal to think about
[57:21] we are Earthly people doomed lost and on
[57:24] the way to hell I don't care how good
[57:26] you think you are what you think you are
[57:29] who you think you are
[57:32] even the Old Testament prophets
[57:35] would be lost without the blood of Jesus
[57:38] Christ
[57:40] they had their salvation for their days
[57:42] and the time that sealed them in until
[57:45] the coming of the Messiah but remember
[57:47] they were looking to the Cross so they
[57:50] had to depend upon that and he had to go
[57:52] to down to paradise and bring Paradise
[57:55] up
[57:56] because that would be the the situation
[57:58] to to bring them out of that position
[58:01] they were in
[58:02] because they were not able to move
[58:04] themselves but let's just read a few
[58:06] look what he says on the oncoming storm
[58:08] number one brother we'll read a few and
[58:10] then we'll
[58:15] just get to our thoughts this is taken
[58:17] from the oncoming storm paragraph 81 60
[58:20] 1960
[58:22] 229. all right he's talking about while
[58:25] they're getting it up
[58:26] that
[58:27] his wife was telling him you know and
[58:30] they went to this and they went ahead
[58:31] and wondered why the new wings and he
[58:34] says uh
[58:36] they are Americans she said well aren't
[58:39] we I said no
[58:42] we just live here
[58:45] but we've been born
[58:48] from above
[58:50] the Holy Spirit come upon us
[58:54] born from above
[58:56] see he knew what it was talking about
[58:58] therefore we are prison strangers here
[59:00] this is not a roboting place but we're
[59:03] seeking the city to come who's building
[59:05] micro is God therefore when you are born
[59:09] of above you have the Holy Spirit coming
[59:13] down from God that changes your nature
[59:15] no matter your
[59:17] sister your mother your best friend
[59:20] could be dressed up but the Christians
[59:22] don't a Christian that's born of the
[59:25] spirit of God is born from above and
[59:27] their spirit is of another kingdom oh
[59:31] I'm so glad to hear of that the
[59:34] simpleness of the Holy Spirit to follow
[59:37] it watch how it behaves itself
[59:43] you must be born from above
[59:49] it wouldn't do us any good to beat you
[59:52] you know we can change a new life
[59:54] you know
[59:56] you come up at New Year you say well I'm
[59:59] going to make a resolution
[1:00:00] and then you're gonna break it before
[1:00:03] that day's over brother Brandon was
[1:00:05] listening to him the other night he said
[1:00:06] I used to watch my daddy he said he'd
[1:00:09] take that plug of the backer and said
[1:00:11] he'd sling that plug of the backer you
[1:00:13] know he's gonna quit said he'd swing it
[1:00:15] out said didn't even watch where it went
[1:00:18] he said cause he's gonna go get it
[1:00:21] right
[1:00:23] this is not changing her mind or our
[1:00:25] thoughts
[1:00:27] because that would not be any good
[1:00:30] then you'll see why that maybe one day
[1:00:33] it will don't understand
[1:00:35] there's not too many the prophet says
[1:00:38] new verse
[1:00:40] you remember that quote
[1:00:42] not too many new verse
[1:00:44] why because people don't know what it is
[1:00:51] they think it's shouty speaking in
[1:00:53] tongues crying
[1:00:57] that's what they think it is
[1:01:01] that's not the new birth
[1:01:04] that's attributes
[1:01:06] you remember we ended up this morning
[1:01:08] talking about it a little listen what he
[1:01:10] goes on to say and as an eagle stirs his
[1:01:12] nest number two
[1:01:15] foreign
[1:01:16] he goes on and says it seems strange and
[1:01:19] said yes sir what makes these people
[1:01:21] act like that is because they're born
[1:01:24] from above they're spirits of another
[1:01:27] kingdom their kingdom is above Jesus
[1:01:30] said if this world was my kingdom my
[1:01:33] people would fight for it but my kingdom
[1:01:36] is up above
[1:01:39] read you Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:01:43] simply read the Bible for yourself
[1:01:47] and watch what it talks about the
[1:01:49] kingdom and the different things you
[1:01:51] know and see what it's doing but do you
[1:01:54] see what he's saying
[1:01:55] look what he goes on to say in the
[1:01:57] Kinsmen Redeemer number three
[1:02:00] priests in 60.
[1:02:02] we're living in America while they're
[1:02:04] rolling out
[1:02:06] that's true that's the body part
[1:02:10] but to Soul that conducts us our
[1:02:13] character is from above
[1:02:16] we live from above because we're born
[1:02:19] from above all Christians come from
[1:02:21] above
[1:02:23] Jesus said I'm not from Below
[1:02:27] I'm from above if I was from below my
[1:02:30] subjects would fight for me but my
[1:02:33] kingdom is of above and so is every man
[1:02:36] that's born of the kingdom of God he's
[1:02:39] from above
[1:02:43] to the children to the young people
[1:02:46] I know we we use a lot of wordings and
[1:02:49] make great things
[1:02:50] and maybe sometimes we leave you not
[1:02:52] knowing what we're talking about
[1:02:56] but brother Dale believes firmly in and
[1:02:58] I believe the prophet did
[1:03:01] that you must be born again
[1:03:05] and then you say well well I believe the
[1:03:08] message
[1:03:09] I didn't say that
[1:03:11] he said well I cried I didn't say that
[1:03:15] he said I come to church every service I
[1:03:17] didn't say that
[1:03:19] because we're going to read in a minute
[1:03:21] you can impersonate every one of them
[1:03:25] but children you must be born again
[1:03:29] right and see that means dying out to
[1:03:33] yourself and accepting Jesus Christ as
[1:03:35] your savior
[1:03:38] but if you don't realize you're lost
[1:03:42] I've been out in the woods
[1:03:45] I don't got lost
[1:03:46] one time
[1:03:48] turned around a little bit maybe a few
[1:03:50] times but
[1:03:52] when you're lost you don't know which
[1:03:54] way you're going
[1:03:57] and trust me you'll go the wrong way
[1:04:00] the old Indian death walk you'll
[1:04:02] generally get in a circle and start
[1:04:03] circling unless you're smart enough to
[1:04:06] not do that on the basis of finding you
[1:04:09] a creek a thing and even your profit was
[1:04:11] turned around one time and kept circling
[1:04:14] and coming back because he didn't find
[1:04:16] any landmarks
[1:04:17] that he could follow had he followed in
[1:04:20] and found a creek or something he was
[1:04:22] making a circle and he just going around
[1:04:24] and around all right
[1:04:26] the
[1:04:27] but we've got to First realize that
[1:04:29] we're lost
[1:04:32] all right
[1:04:33] now Mom and Daddy loves you
[1:04:36] and you know they do all they can to
[1:04:37] help you
[1:04:38] and you know whatever thing and they
[1:04:40] want you to live right and do good
[1:04:44] but
[1:04:45] they're not your God they're not your
[1:04:47] savior they're not you're doing sure
[1:04:52] they help you and do all they can
[1:04:55] but kids you must be born again
[1:04:59] and you say well what does that mean
[1:05:01] I've been in the message all of my life
[1:05:04] I was born in this message well that's
[1:05:07] good
[1:05:10] but
[1:05:11] have you really accepted Jesus Christ as
[1:05:13] your savior
[1:05:17] well I didn't know I needed now you do
[1:05:19] okay I got it now so now you do no
[1:05:23] matter whether it's kids or adults now
[1:05:25] you know
[1:05:26] you know that you need to accept Jesus
[1:05:29] Christ as your savior we will get into
[1:05:31] more of these as we progress further in
[1:05:34] the thought
[1:05:35] of trying to help understand what it
[1:05:38] really means to be born again
[1:05:42] and what transpires within your life
[1:05:45] during those things
[1:05:47] but just remember
[1:05:49] number one you're lost
[1:05:52] why must you be born again because
[1:05:54] you're lost
[1:05:56] well brother Dale told me told me that
[1:05:58] I've lost
[1:05:59] well honey he just don't know what
[1:06:01] you're talking about you was born in the
[1:06:03] message and your mom and daddy was in
[1:06:05] the message
[1:06:07] now that don't
[1:06:10] run with me now
[1:06:12] it may run with your mom and daddy but
[1:06:15] it don't run with me
[1:06:17] all right
[1:06:18] my kids my grandkids my great grandkids
[1:06:21] my wife ever they've got to have their
[1:06:23] own experience with Jesus Christ
[1:06:27] not because I'm Papa the pastor
[1:06:31] that doesn't save nobody
[1:06:34] it's when you have the experience in
[1:06:37] your heart and life of Jesus Christ
[1:06:42] and that way then I want you to know
[1:06:44] that we have to be born from above
[1:06:47] all right watch what he goes on to say
[1:06:51] this is taken from the message the mark
[1:06:53] of the beast
[1:06:55] 1961.
[1:06:59] you talk about the kingdom and the
[1:07:01] citizens and all of it the kingdom of
[1:07:03] God is within you
[1:07:06] see they've argued even in organized
[1:07:08] religion I remember that one brother
[1:07:09] dick I know we used to talk about they
[1:07:12] argued about the point where it says
[1:07:15] Jesus said the kingdom is within
[1:07:17] some said it was just right there
[1:07:21] and some said it was in him and some
[1:07:23] said it was in US
[1:07:25] and all kind of what does it mean
[1:07:28] he simply meant what he said
[1:07:32] the kingdom was Within
[1:07:34] because once you receive the new birth
[1:07:36] it's not without
[1:07:38] it's within
[1:07:41] right
[1:07:42] so it matters is within
[1:07:45] the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost you
[1:07:48] belong to that Kingdom that's the reason
[1:07:49] women don't bother her don't worry
[1:07:52] were shorts that's the reason men don't
[1:07:56] smoke cigarettes and things like that
[1:07:58] they're from above their Spirit teaches
[1:08:00] them righteousness Holiness they don't
[1:08:04] they don't swear they they don't don't
[1:08:07] use bad language and think why they're
[1:08:10] born from above they're different
[1:08:12] they're from citizens from above
[1:08:18] what kind of a
[1:08:20] reaction or thought
[1:08:23] what you have of the way the life
[1:08:27] that Jesus Christ would live
[1:08:31] what if he were here today
[1:08:35] I mean
[1:08:36] 2015.
[1:08:37] how would he live
[1:08:43] he wouldn't walk down the streets with a
[1:08:46] dick and big old robe
[1:08:54] he wouldn't act like that
[1:09:00] he would act and look in the similarity
[1:09:02] to what we are
[1:09:04] I said similarity because he wouldn't
[1:09:06] follow her after the wrong things
[1:09:09] but he would still be in that form or
[1:09:11] similarity or to what we are
[1:09:16] and that's always been the thing that
[1:09:19] helps me to understand anything about
[1:09:21] Christianity
[1:09:23] my whole question in my life has always
[1:09:26] been one thing what would Jesus do
[1:09:29] then they came up with this thing they
[1:09:31] were on their arms you know the kids you
[1:09:34] know the bands the WW J D is that the
[1:09:38] way it's going on there what would Jesus
[1:09:40] do you know
[1:09:42] well
[1:09:44] I had a man really rebuking me heavily
[1:09:46] one time about
[1:09:49] it didn't matter what she'd done or
[1:09:50] didn't do
[1:09:54] he said Jesus had long hair
[1:09:58] and said you say we're not supposed to
[1:10:00] have it as men
[1:10:04] so you know what I do and I just told
[1:10:06] him I said I'm not going to compromise
[1:10:08] with you I'm going to just make a
[1:10:10] statement
[1:10:13] if you lived like the Lord Jesus
[1:10:16] your hurricane drag the ground
[1:10:19] that's as simple as I could have make it
[1:10:23] it stopped the whole conversation I said
[1:10:26] you know you don't live like he did
[1:10:29] so there's no need of discussing whether
[1:10:31] it's long hire because see I would even
[1:10:34] agree that it was shoulder length higher
[1:10:36] because we'd have the words of the
[1:10:38] Prophet they wouldn't care about that
[1:10:39] but you know
[1:10:41] I don't have no problem with Jesus with
[1:10:43] shoulder length heart
[1:10:46] you know I don't have no problem with me
[1:10:49] and hire a little fool but now when it
[1:10:52] gets to running down and curling up and
[1:10:53] go down the back then and then you got
[1:10:55] to ponytail it up then you know you're
[1:10:57] getting a little bit on that
[1:10:59] and I'm sorry I'm too old I still think
[1:11:02] about the Tinker Bell
[1:11:05] ninety percent of you don't even know
[1:11:07] what that means
[1:11:08] we didn't call them bad names in our day
[1:11:12] we call them feminist Tinker Bells
[1:11:16] you know all right
[1:11:18] and get you in trouble
[1:11:22] like I said to the man I said if you
[1:11:25] live like Jesus and act like Jesus you
[1:11:27] can just the Earth just leave your hair
[1:11:28] alone
[1:11:30] you know
[1:11:31] yeah but it it just won't work but see
[1:11:34] you're born from above
[1:11:37] he said I'm glad our kingdom is above
[1:11:40] and if our kingdom is above we're born
[1:11:42] from above
[1:11:44] then we seek those things which are
[1:11:48] above where Christ sits at the right
[1:11:51] hand of God
[1:11:52] that's 252.
[1:11:54] God being misunderstood
[1:11:59] it goes on on God identifying himself by
[1:12:01] his characteristics
[1:12:04] he said this is the best Nation
[1:12:07] in the world
[1:12:08] but yet we're not Americans
[1:12:11] I said we are born from above the Holy
[1:12:14] Spirit come down and we belong to a
[1:12:17] kingdom it's not of this world
[1:12:19] that's the reason our sisters don't do
[1:12:22] the things of the world
[1:12:25] all right
[1:12:28] look what he goes on is getting my point
[1:12:30] in the thought
[1:12:31] look at number nine
[1:12:33] which is taken from the message called a
[1:12:35] paradox 63.
[1:12:38] that virgin birth was a mystery to the
[1:12:42] people
[1:12:44] they couldn't understand it
[1:12:47] just like the new birth is today
[1:12:52] the new birth is a mystery to the people
[1:12:56] they can't understand it they don't know
[1:12:58] what you mean they have belittled it
[1:13:02] bring it down saying well just because
[1:13:07] you believe something
[1:13:10] the Devils believes the same thing and
[1:13:12] Trembley
[1:13:13] it isn't what you believe
[1:13:15] is what God has actually done
[1:13:19] the new birth is a birth
[1:13:23] it was a new it was a paradox when God
[1:13:28] brought new life to the human race to
[1:13:30] reject it is eternal separation to
[1:13:33] receive it is eternal life
[1:13:36] a mystery
[1:13:40] now according to the definitions of
[1:13:42] Webster and bringing it down through the
[1:13:45] prophet's message
[1:13:46] a mystery is something that
[1:13:50] has not been made known
[1:13:52] it's been sealed away from you
[1:13:55] and it's a mystery and no matter how
[1:13:58] much you know about the doings it's
[1:14:00] still a mystery
[1:14:03] you know
[1:14:05] the atom bomb you can hold it in your
[1:14:08] hand
[1:14:10] but what do you think about comparing
[1:14:12] that to the fact of where they started
[1:14:17] with electric lights
[1:14:20] you know
[1:14:22] in the first what would it what was his
[1:14:24] name the the guy that made the first one
[1:14:32] you know done a man's house and he
[1:14:35] showed how to do it and he turned it on
[1:14:38] and made electric lights throughout the
[1:14:40] house
[1:14:41] do you realize the atom bomb is just a
[1:14:44] that if that had never been perfected in
[1:14:47] the electrical light situation the atom
[1:14:51] bomb would have never existed
[1:14:53] because it's simply
[1:14:56] uh further advancement
[1:15:00] of electricity
[1:15:03] but it had to go through many processes
[1:15:06] to be able to come to that
[1:15:10] all right
[1:15:13] we look back in the days of
[1:15:16] Martin Luther especially to come down
[1:15:18] into the ages
[1:15:20] and we see him in what he taught
[1:15:25] and that was the new birth of that time
[1:15:29] the just shall live by faith
[1:15:35] John Wesley comes along and believes the
[1:15:38] things Martin Luther had taught
[1:15:42] and he's converted under that you know
[1:15:45] the story
[1:15:47] but yet he realizes that there has a
[1:15:50] desire seemingly to him
[1:15:52] and he leaves there Londoner where it
[1:15:56] was comes to America
[1:15:58] to convert
[1:16:01] the heathen
[1:16:05] he runs into a group of people called a
[1:16:08] moraviander more rather how you
[1:16:10] pronounce it
[1:16:11] and they're actually taught him the way
[1:16:14] of sanctification
[1:16:19] but you know in all they could teach him
[1:16:21] they were not the messenger of the age
[1:16:24] and could not do what John Wesley done
[1:16:28] John Wesley took Luther's message and
[1:16:30] stood on it
[1:16:32] and then he seemed that there was more
[1:16:33] to the new birth
[1:16:36] and he stepped out on sanctification
[1:16:41] and you know what the new birth was of
[1:16:43] the days of John Wesley
[1:16:46] sanctification
[1:16:50] but it was still what more of the what
[1:16:53] he started with
[1:16:59] in one day the baptism when the Holy
[1:17:01] Ghost came on the Zeus
[1:17:04] then the message came the things and
[1:17:06] we're still what if Peter call it being
[1:17:09] born again
[1:17:13] further
[1:17:14] divising things and you look back there
[1:17:16] and once you can see it you look back
[1:17:20] then to the Old Testament and you can
[1:17:22] see what those men were actually
[1:17:25] speaking of
[1:17:29] and that's why that I read that when I
[1:17:31] go to her he said Jesus said if you'd
[1:17:33] have known Moses you'd have known me
[1:17:36] because that he spoke of me
[1:17:39] we don't know where he spoke you
[1:17:42] well you didn't read the Bible
[1:17:46] oh yeah they studied it every day they
[1:17:47] could tell you every word that was in it
[1:17:49] but they didn't get the thought that was
[1:17:51] in the Bible
[1:17:54] the thought that was in the Bible was
[1:17:57] speaking of the coming Messiah to die
[1:18:03] to give his life
[1:18:06] the word mankind
[1:18:08] could be born again
[1:18:10] and that someone would have to come
[1:18:13] to do that
[1:18:15] and it would not be just another human
[1:18:17] being
[1:18:23] it wouldn't be just an anointing
[1:18:25] you know that some of the Jews
[1:18:27] you know there's so much split within
[1:18:29] the Jewish
[1:18:31] ranks of doing that some of the Jews
[1:18:34] believed just a few years ago he was
[1:18:36] about 90 years old up here like New York
[1:18:38] or somewhere and they believed that was
[1:18:40] the Messiah
[1:18:41] because they were only looking for an
[1:18:43] anointing
[1:18:46] they were not looking for a person to
[1:18:48] come and to be born as it had to be born
[1:18:51] they just picked this man out because he
[1:18:53] probably had signs following him
[1:18:55] you know
[1:18:58] but follow my point for a second
[1:19:02] you must be born again
[1:19:06] there's a mystery
[1:19:10] but yet we've got to
[1:19:13] to the point
[1:19:16] that what we do is like he goes on to
[1:19:19] thirsting for life
[1:19:23] and he said the reason men go and join
[1:19:26] churches and put their names on them is
[1:19:29] because they're trying to bypass the new
[1:19:32] birth
[1:19:34] and watch it they don't want the new
[1:19:37] birth
[1:19:40] and some of the theologians today figure
[1:19:43] out what they called the new birth
[1:19:46] shake hands put your name on a paper you
[1:19:49] believe a declaration of creeds
[1:19:52] but the new birth is to be die
[1:19:55] and be born again a new a new creature
[1:19:59] in Christ
[1:20:01] see they can't understand now watch what
[1:20:03] he said though he says they bypass
[1:20:09] they don't want the new birth
[1:20:14] what about a people teaching you a way
[1:20:17] to heaven
[1:20:19] you don't you don't think this way I
[1:20:21] know I'm the only one to build in this
[1:20:22] wacko crazy to think the way I do but
[1:20:26] I'm sorry
[1:20:29] you got a church
[1:20:31] that they've spent all of their life
[1:20:33] sending their preachers to seminaries to
[1:20:36] teach you a set of rules or creeds
[1:20:40] and the prophet says they bypass the new
[1:20:43] birth he said they don't want it
[1:20:47] foreign
[1:20:49] you want to go right over here I'm not
[1:20:52] throwing those stones you want to go
[1:20:54] right over here and tell that brother he
[1:20:56] don't want a new birth
[1:20:59] you're going to be told off
[1:21:02] right
[1:21:04] because he's going to tell you I spent
[1:21:06] all my life
[1:21:09] all my life I've spent to try to bring
[1:21:11] the new birth to my people
[1:21:14] you said but you went by the traditions
[1:21:20] why didn't you go from the honestness of
[1:21:22] your heart
[1:21:23] to try to see the things in the word
[1:21:29] why do you want to bypass the real New
[1:21:32] Birth
[1:21:33] and to take something and call it the
[1:21:35] new birth
[1:21:39] I'm not talking about over there I'm
[1:21:41] talking about over here you remember me
[1:21:43] I Don't Preach over there
[1:21:45] that internet
[1:21:47] is going out I'm not the pastor the
[1:21:50] internet of the world
[1:21:51] I refuse to answer any questions even
[1:21:55] from ministers that are brought in I
[1:21:57] mean I've tried to answer give me an
[1:21:59] answer questions because I'm not going
[1:22:01] to
[1:22:02] pasture or anything like that
[1:22:05] I'm talking to Lula Georgia
[1:22:08] to you and me
[1:22:10] that some of you maybe claim the new
[1:22:13] birth from a wavelander longer than even
[1:22:16] my thoughts of it
[1:22:19] but is it genuine
[1:22:23] you get your feeling to hurt at me
[1:22:24] because I say so
[1:22:29] you know
[1:22:32] I mean you get upset at me because I say
[1:22:35] something to you
[1:22:38] hey you ordered let's be able to quote
[1:22:40] but if I said got to let somebody say
[1:22:42] something see how you react that's
[1:22:45] number one but what if you say something
[1:22:47] mean it
[1:22:49] you know
[1:22:51] I mean sister Anna what if I walked up
[1:22:53] to you and said to Anna I want you to
[1:22:55] know you're lost
[1:22:58] don't tell me I'm lost I'll drop him
[1:23:02] Jaws
[1:23:09] that's going to prove you something was
[1:23:12] right when but you understand my point
[1:23:17] my point is
[1:23:19] if we're born from above you know that
[1:23:21] won't bother us at all
[1:23:27] you know that I used to work with these
[1:23:28] brothers that are sitting right here one
[1:23:30] two three three I know for sure sitting
[1:23:33] here now
[1:23:34] I used to work with
[1:23:36] I think it was seven of us at one time
[1:23:41] and we Fellowship together every day
[1:23:43] eight together talked together worked
[1:23:46] side by side a lot of days
[1:23:48] you know what they call me
[1:23:51] a queer
[1:23:55] that I was a homosexual
[1:23:57] because all I'd done was hung around men
[1:24:01] well you know that didn't offend me
[1:24:06] I didn't get mad at nobody
[1:24:09] it didn't upset me for them to think
[1:24:11] that
[1:24:12] you know what I think
[1:24:14] if I hadn't have been born again I'd
[1:24:16] probably think the same thing
[1:24:19] you don't ever do that
[1:24:22] you don't ever think things over and
[1:24:24] wonder what side of the fence you would
[1:24:26] be on had God not brought you to where
[1:24:28] you are
[1:24:34] thank you
[1:24:36] in the end it brought us to the position
[1:24:38] to where we'd have an understanding we
[1:24:40] would be falling for the traditions and
[1:24:42] the ways of mankind
[1:24:48] thank God for the truth
[1:24:51] but the new birth is a mystery
[1:24:57] shouting he said speaking in tongues I
[1:24:59] gave it this morning
[1:25:03] he said those are just attributes
[1:25:06] that follow the life
[1:25:10] yet we call it the new birth
[1:25:14] he said are you born again I spoke in
[1:25:17] tongues I shot it I cried I believe the
[1:25:20] word I walk with the prophet I slept
[1:25:22] with him I hunted with him
[1:25:24] I believe everything said
[1:25:28] you ever seen people that tell you are
[1:25:29] right balance to your face I believe
[1:25:31] everything the prophet says
[1:25:37] well the Bible and the prophet both says
[1:25:39] forsake not descending of yourself
[1:25:41] together as the manner of some is
[1:25:45] and yet people believe everything
[1:25:48] the prophet said but don't go to church
[1:25:53] right
[1:25:58] see this
[1:26:00] right
[1:26:02] but look we put everything on shouting
[1:26:04] speaking in tongues running crying
[1:26:07] praying whatever
[1:26:10] according to questions and answers 1954
[1:26:12] he said that's just attributes that
[1:26:15] follow
[1:26:16] he said the first thing is to accept the
[1:26:19] person
[1:26:21] Christ Jesus
[1:26:23] all right
[1:26:26] look what he says on this one and I
[1:26:28] enjoy it because you will see one of
[1:26:31] these days the Lord willing
[1:26:33] looks the last one we use it
[1:26:35] I will restore
[1:26:38] and you'll see why brother Branham a lot
[1:26:40] of times had to say what he said
[1:26:44] I've studied this message for 50 years
[1:26:48] and to see the perfection
[1:26:51] or the lineup the man had
[1:26:54] did in 54 unless side by side was 65. 47
[1:27:01] -65.
[1:27:04] and see that he really knew what he was
[1:27:08] talking about
[1:27:10] and you know yourself that I in the
[1:27:13] ministry style that I've been that I
[1:27:15] spent the biggest portion of my Ministry
[1:27:18] taking things that looked like and he
[1:27:22] said this and he said this that we're
[1:27:24] contrary to one to the other
[1:27:25] to the Daniel 70 weeks to the godhead
[1:27:28] New Birth the predestinations the
[1:27:31] marriage and divorce
[1:27:33] that I've spent that time
[1:27:36] declaring that
[1:27:38] he knew what he was talking about
[1:27:40] now I don't believe he knew what he's
[1:27:42] talking about all the time I said that I
[1:27:45] never did say that
[1:27:46] but it's so amazing sometimes I wonder
[1:27:48] did he even know what he said
[1:27:53] until a later date would come and he'd
[1:27:55] see why
[1:27:59] see the people of this message reject
[1:28:01] all organized religion all forms or
[1:28:04] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[1:28:06] Pentecostals
[1:28:09] but how can you build a church
[1:28:12] and reject the truth of Martin Luther
[1:28:18] the truth
[1:28:20] of Martin Luther not when he was
[1:28:22] teaching that the Jews ought to be took
[1:28:24] out and be killed
[1:28:25] that was just a human being
[1:28:28] that was under the age of his doing that
[1:28:30] he'd smoke a pipe and drank a beer and
[1:28:32] talk about the Lord
[1:28:37] but yet he had to message you that day
[1:28:39] and for you to be in the body of that
[1:28:41] day you was going to believe that
[1:28:42] message
[1:28:45] think about it
[1:28:47] well then do you reject the Lutheran
[1:28:49] message no
[1:28:52] I reject the denominational teachings of
[1:28:55] what the man taught
[1:28:59] that way brother run said we don't have
[1:29:01] nothing against organize religion
[1:29:04] he said it's the doctrine
[1:29:07] systems
[1:29:09] why can't we be friends and neighbors
[1:29:11] with people of other religions
[1:29:18] I want to get their Spirit don't you
[1:29:20] worry about it honey you ain't gonna get
[1:29:23] it you don't got it
[1:29:25] well that's the reason you're saying
[1:29:27] that
[1:29:28] because you're scared to death
[1:29:34] are you afraid to face someone with your
[1:29:36] Doctrine
[1:29:38] let's read what your Prophet had to say
[1:29:44] for my will restore Worship the Lord
[1:29:47] a man come to me here on the West Coast
[1:29:50] a few weeks ago he said brother Branham
[1:29:54] I went I've been trying to seek the Lord
[1:29:56] for the last five years
[1:29:58] he said I went to Mr Graham's meeting
[1:30:01] meeting he told me to hold up my hand
[1:30:04] except Jesus
[1:30:06] said I did
[1:30:08] I went out with the same thing
[1:30:12] I went to a free Methodist Church they
[1:30:15] told me I had to get happy enough to
[1:30:18] shout and I did and said I still went
[1:30:21] away unsatisfied
[1:30:24] I said I went to another man's meeting
[1:30:26] now you all know him brother Roberts
[1:30:29] exactly my buddy my friend said brother
[1:30:32] Robert says stay in there until you
[1:30:36] speak with tongues then you got it
[1:30:39] so he said I went there and prayed until
[1:30:42] I did speak with tongues and still
[1:30:46] I haven't got it and watch it
[1:30:51] I said my brother
[1:30:53] what Billy Graham told you is the truth
[1:30:55] you know just believe
[1:30:58] he said that's the truth
[1:31:01] what the Free Methodist told you is the
[1:31:04] truth
[1:31:06] sounds good believe it's good
[1:31:10] when Oral Roberts told you is the truth
[1:31:13] seeing her long enough right around and
[1:31:15] said quote it he said if you stay under
[1:31:18] the spout long enough you'll come
[1:31:19] through speaking in tongues that's the
[1:31:22] prophet's word
[1:31:26] but look what he said
[1:31:28] what Oral Roberts told you is the truth
[1:31:33] I don't believe
[1:31:35] me he's he's explaining
[1:31:38] what they said
[1:31:41] and each one of them was part of the
[1:31:43] truth
[1:31:44] believing is part of the truth
[1:31:47] or to be all the truth but I mean I'm
[1:31:49] getting the point
[1:31:51] shouting crying is part of the truth we
[1:31:54] believe in it speaking in tongues is
[1:31:56] part of the truth we believe in it
[1:31:58] right
[1:32:00] but receiving Christ is not whether you
[1:32:03] shout whether you hold up your hand it's
[1:32:06] receiving the person Christ Jesus in
[1:32:09] your heart and these things are
[1:32:11] attributes that follow it
[1:32:15] attributes that follow it the shout the
[1:32:18] speaking in tongue the things you do is
[1:32:20] attributes
[1:32:22] like smoking drinking gambling is not
[1:32:26] sin it's an attribute
[1:32:30] right
[1:32:32] see we make the birth the attribute
[1:32:39] come on you've heard the prophets say
[1:32:41] I've seen a lot of people shouting in
[1:32:43] that
[1:32:44] you've seen people thinking tongues
[1:32:46] didn't happen he said sin ending speak
[1:32:48] in tongues and write in unknown tongues
[1:32:52] and tell the truth
[1:32:57] but see none of that is to be born from
[1:32:59] above
[1:33:03] none of that is the new birth all of
[1:33:05] that is attributes
[1:33:08] for you to do after you receive Jesus
[1:33:12] Christ
[1:33:14] well you're taking away everything I
[1:33:16] ever believed
[1:33:17] okay
[1:33:18] if I can take away what you believe you
[1:33:21] didn't ever believe it
[1:33:23] it was never a revelation
[1:33:25] that's right
[1:33:26] it went to Revelation we'll get to that
[1:33:29] that the new birth is a revelation
[1:33:34] we'll get to those things
[1:33:36] but the main point of understanding is
[1:33:39] what
[1:33:41] you got to be born from above
[1:33:46] the new birth
[1:33:48] is not crying speaking in drunk shouting
[1:33:50] believing
[1:33:53] all of those are wonderful
[1:33:56] and part of the Christian Life
[1:33:59] but they are not the new birth
[1:34:07] two
[1:34:14] to the world
[1:34:16] around him explaining the new birth
[1:34:23] I'm going to have to say it when I get
[1:34:24] there to it anyway
[1:34:27] but to most people in this message
[1:34:30] they cannot even tell you what brother
[1:34:32] Branham says a new birth is
[1:34:39] because they don't study that
[1:34:42] that was a piece that was we're into
[1:34:45] these great Revelations of these seals
[1:34:48] and Thunders and trumpets and vowels
[1:34:52] you remember like I said the other day
[1:34:54] when the brother said we go out Beyond
[1:34:57] brother Branham
[1:34:59] I said okay he preached us to the Future
[1:35:02] home so now tell me after the future
[1:35:04] home don't talk about me some of these
[1:35:06] other little play things you're going to
[1:35:08] talk about
[1:35:09] tell me out Mr
[1:35:13] he couldn't do that
[1:35:20] but what does it mean to you
[1:35:23] that you're born from above
[1:35:26] is this a fictitational story
[1:35:31] with a superhero of Superman
[1:35:35] or Saint Nick
[1:35:38] or some
[1:35:40] character
[1:35:46] or is this the Bible
[1:35:48] speaking of the very God of Glory
[1:35:53] see the only way you could be born from
[1:35:55] above would be for your life to come
[1:35:58] from above
[1:36:02] right
[1:36:04] so if you're gonna have a Superman
[1:36:07] you know coming from another planet
[1:36:10] then you're gonna have to remember that
[1:36:11] we've got to come from dark too
[1:36:15] right
[1:36:19] no brother Dale we don't believe that
[1:36:20] but you believe more in that than you
[1:36:22] believe the real truth
[1:36:31] you'd rather believe something fictition
[1:36:34] or something
[1:36:37] and Satan has had a lot of them
[1:36:43] and they're called preachers
[1:36:45] because that's what the Bible says that
[1:36:48] is angels are as Ministers of
[1:36:51] righteousness when you see a law teacher
[1:36:54] just remember he ain't even in the class
[1:36:56] now if you want to argue with about the
[1:36:58] art with the Bible it says his Ministers
[1:37:01] of Satan were as Ministers of
[1:37:03] righteousness
[1:37:05] they'll bring you enough for the right
[1:37:09] to deceive you with it
[1:37:15] they're not even to the point of saying
[1:37:17] you got to do this and you got to do
[1:37:18] that
[1:37:20] but then what about the biggest portion
[1:37:22] of this message people that says you got
[1:37:24] to do this you got to do that
[1:37:28] I know they're born again because of the
[1:37:31] way they live
[1:37:33] that's good
[1:37:37] good but you live all of that good life
[1:37:39] and impersonate it and still be lost
[1:37:45] well you don't believe in living good no
[1:37:50] just go ahead and run your run your
[1:37:52] thoughts about what I'd say I don't
[1:37:54] believe in living good I believe in
[1:37:56] being born again
[1:37:58] I got the quote laying in here first
[1:38:00] laying on the desk
[1:38:02] where that's what the prophet is saying
[1:38:05] it's not the fact that you're trying to
[1:38:06] live good
[1:38:08] it's a fact of whether you're born again
[1:38:10] or not he said if you're born again the
[1:38:13] life will take care of itself
[1:38:16] wouldn't that be something I have to get
[1:38:18] up every morning now Peggy don't you
[1:38:20] know
[1:38:21] now you're Christian
[1:38:24] true you don't cut your hair today
[1:38:28] and you got to wear dresses
[1:38:32] and at night when you get ready to go to
[1:38:34] bed God I thank you that my wife
[1:38:36] survived being a Christian today
[1:38:43] come on this is what the prophet said
[1:38:45] this morning
[1:38:46] when the man said what must we do to be
[1:38:48] born again he said we tell them what not
[1:38:51] to do
[1:38:54] did he didn't ask that he won't know how
[1:38:56] to get born again
[1:38:58] well you just come to church and you
[1:39:01] believe and just do the best you can
[1:39:05] one of these days Lord take care of it
[1:39:08] yeah
[1:39:13] born from above
[1:39:16] now make this life statement
[1:39:21] now according to our understanding
[1:39:25] we're not talking about a Superman
[1:39:27] situation
[1:39:30] even though isn't it odd that Superman
[1:39:32] came to Earth as a baby
[1:39:34] that was an odd one
[1:39:40] but
[1:39:43] we think about
[1:39:45] a supernatural
[1:39:47] person
[1:39:51] right
[1:39:53] and did he come from a supernatural
[1:39:55] world
[1:39:58] to live in US
[1:40:01] to make us Supernatural
[1:40:04] and that is the new birth
[1:40:08] well if there was a planet of Krypton
[1:40:12] or anything you'd want to call it
[1:40:15] and Jesus come from there
[1:40:19] then we ought to wanna
[1:40:21] live and look like
[1:40:24] that
[1:40:26] true
[1:40:27] shouldn't we not want to be like him
[1:40:36] what about it
[1:40:44] I thought
[1:40:47] that this thing was going to wind up on
[1:40:50] Earth
[1:40:52] I thought it would wind up in and we
[1:40:55] would have a millennial reign
[1:40:57] here on Earth
[1:40:59] and then we would go and have a future
[1:41:01] home here on Earth
[1:41:04] that it was not going to another planet
[1:41:06] or a situation
[1:41:11] but that God of Glory would come here
[1:41:16] and live with us and this would be the
[1:41:17] center of the universe
[1:41:20] because everywhere God is would be the
[1:41:22] center of all things
[1:41:26] what about it
[1:41:31] but it is true
[1:41:34] that he came a baby
[1:41:37] and you know what it is true
[1:41:40] that if we're born into this Kingdom
[1:41:43] the Bible says we must become as a
[1:41:47] little child
[1:41:53] right
[1:41:55] now you explain that one I'm 75. I'm
[1:41:59] Nicodemus now you mean I got to go back
[1:42:01] to my mama yeah
[1:42:05] you just said it no the day I got born
[1:42:08] again I had to become a child
[1:42:11] to receive that within my heart
[1:42:15] because a child is the only one that can
[1:42:17] understand that
[1:42:20] a child can understand
[1:42:24] each other and fight and bicker and
[1:42:26] argue and fuss the next minute hugging
[1:42:28] in life and then going on
[1:42:32] and they're not even born again at a lot
[1:42:34] of places
[1:42:36] but yet they're acting like another
[1:42:38] civilization
[1:42:42] so we must become as a child
[1:42:49] die out to all of our thinking and
[1:42:51] accept Jesus Christ
[1:42:53] and become a baby in Christ to desire
[1:42:57] the sincere milk of the word that we may
[1:43:00] grow thereby
[1:43:06] that we're actually born from above
[1:43:11] we're not of this world
[1:43:15] we have to live here we make a living we
[1:43:17] have to do things but we're not of this
[1:43:19] world
[1:43:21] we sing that song This world's not my
[1:43:23] home
[1:43:25] it's true it's not come on brothers
[1:43:28] this world's not our home
[1:43:31] we're just here for a while
[1:43:36] all right
[1:43:41] we didn't come from that other world
[1:43:44] in any physical form
[1:43:48] we must be transmitted
[1:43:50] into
[1:43:52] the kingdom
[1:43:55] that was within him to be like him
[1:43:59] while we're here
[1:44:03] then we found out to go to heaven
[1:44:05] doesn't mean that we go flying to the
[1:44:07] sky
[1:44:10] in that it starts off by being
[1:44:12] resurrected sitting in Heavenly places
[1:44:14] in Christ Jesus
[1:44:17] and then it will eventually finish up by
[1:44:19] God and
[1:44:21] everything coming here
[1:44:24] Joe is not a Superman story
[1:44:31] is God's Bible
[1:44:34] to unfold in a Simplicity of you and I
[1:44:37] as being Christians
[1:44:43] you know what we have a right to look at
[1:44:45] people
[1:44:47] and I say enough talk to you we don't
[1:44:49] need to because it don't work no good
[1:44:51] but we do have a right to look at people
[1:44:53] if I act like
[1:44:56] some other country you can say I must be
[1:45:00] from that other country
[1:45:02] right
[1:45:04] and if I act like the world you can say
[1:45:07] that I must be the world
[1:45:11] but if we act like Christ
[1:45:15] then maybe something has started in our
[1:45:17] hearts and lives
[1:45:21] to make us Worthy
[1:45:24] born from above
[1:45:27] not from Below
[1:45:32] a kingdom
[1:45:34] read Matthew Mark Luke and John and
[1:45:36] notice everything that's spoken of the
[1:45:38] Kingdom every other Parable is a kingdom
[1:45:41] the kingdom kingdom kingdom of heaven is
[1:45:43] like a deer the kingdom you know what we
[1:45:45] get into in the in the para in The
[1:45:48] Parables on the kingdom one of them
[1:45:50] talks about the kingdom of God the other
[1:45:51] talks about the kingdom of heaven
[1:45:55] I've heard people argue over that one of
[1:45:58] them was one thing and the other one was
[1:46:01] another thing
[1:46:03] I said I always thought it's just a new
[1:46:05] birth
[1:46:06] put us in the Kingdom yeah but you got
[1:46:09] the kingdom of God
[1:46:10] is to do this the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:46:12] to do that
[1:46:14] I didn't know you had to divide it up
[1:46:18] I thought he was the god of Heaven
[1:46:22] right
[1:46:24] well yeah we can take all of that and
[1:46:26] argue doctor we can argue argue uh
[1:46:29] attributes
[1:46:34] my attribute fits the word
[1:46:39] I know where the Prophet said that
[1:46:42] it's whether or not the spirit in you
[1:46:44] agrees with the word
[1:46:45] amen
[1:46:48] in my spirit of Grace with the word
[1:46:53] I doubt that
[1:46:57] you need somebody to jog you just a
[1:47:00] little bit to see what you do believe
[1:47:05] you need somebody to ring your jaws
[1:47:07] physically to see whether you're not
[1:47:09] whether or not you got the spirit of
[1:47:11] Christ to be able to turn the other
[1:47:13] cheek
[1:47:19] you'll not be another way
[1:47:22] well why not
[1:47:25] is it the truth
[1:47:28] should we be that way should we pray for
[1:47:30] our enemies
[1:47:32] and them that despite flee uses
[1:47:38] the word I pray for my friends but it's
[1:47:40] hard to pray for my enemies
[1:47:42] right Susan
[1:47:46] we get a kick out of her in Bible study
[1:47:48] she's always asking a question for
[1:47:51] some friend
[1:47:55] I got a friend that's got a question
[1:47:59] we know the friend that's got a question
[1:48:01] she raised a hand
[1:48:06] but that way we can all be Christian
[1:48:08] let's stand together what do we got
[1:48:10] brother
[1:48:12] what we got
[1:48:15] E flat let's just sing a song Anybody
[1:48:17] ever need now remember we're going
[1:48:18] downstairs and eat some cake and ice
[1:48:20] cream
[1:48:22] sweet
[1:48:26] let's say
[1:48:47] are you born from above
[1:49:29] We Believe
[1:49:34] already
[1:49:45] his grace
[1:50:14] to the people we've seen great things
[1:50:17] happen from just prayer claws right
[1:50:21] we lay our hands upon this prayer Clause
[1:50:24] this piece of material to be made into
[1:50:28] little pieces given to people as a
[1:50:31] prayer call
[1:50:32] and we've had it here laying on the
[1:50:34] platform for a long time we wore it
[1:50:38] today within our body as we preach the
[1:50:40] gospel and now we gather together as men
[1:50:44] of the gospel and ask you to just come
[1:50:48] down and put your anointing upon these
[1:50:51] Claws and as we give them to people that
[1:50:54] it will take care of the needs in the
[1:50:58] bodies
[1:51:01] and we thank you father in Jesus name
[1:51:05] amen
[1:51:07] praise God
[1:51:10] yes
[1:51:50] in Jesus Christ Lord Jesus
[1:52:10] thank you
