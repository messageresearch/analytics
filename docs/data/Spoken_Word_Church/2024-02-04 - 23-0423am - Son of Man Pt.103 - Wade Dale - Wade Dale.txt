for those of you that don't know that's my wife J she's right here sometimes you have to tell people so we were discussing last night about doing a um having like a sewing class or last year we had a canning class after we did our garden we had a canning class and then maybe a Class A cooking class some of you don't need it but some of you borderline and some all of you need a sewing class so June don't have to sew your clothes for you tomorrow praise the Lord thank you anyway yeah brother Aaron spoke up that's good but no really if y'all want to do that let sister Jun know yes we'd like to do that we'll have a signup sheet we'll do it on one Saturday afternoon we'll get you lunch for you guys y'all can go fishing whatever you need to do just leave the sisters alone and let them do their thing here if they want to do that so that would be either a sewing class or a cooking class no date has been set yet now May the 7th May the 7th I know I'm jumping around a little bit but I just remembered these as I was writing them down May the 7th here at the church at the second service all right we will have a vow renewal service all right if you want to renew your vows with you and your sweetheart buy her a bouquet and we will have a vow renewal we've done this several times over the years and then also we will warm the pool up outside and if you want to be baptized or re-baptized we're going to have that the same thing on the second service on May the 7th all right is everybody with me that's the weekend before Mother's Day all right so May the 7th vow renewal and baptismal service if you want to be re-baptized or baptized that'd be a good time we baptized 20 people last year and we sure appreciate the Lord being with us and then I pray that the Lord will carry on what he's doing with those 20 and then more and then more and then more all right so I think that's pretty much got it let's bow our heads dear Lord Jesus thank you for the Bride of Jesus Christ thank you for for bringing us together Lord from all over the world we're a worldwide bride Lord You' brought them from all Corners today in one little place called Lula Georgia that's so insignificant hardly can find it on the map but Lord we've come today not to hear from this area or this building we come here to hear from you and father I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus that you'll do the speaking today you be the active participant in this service you take over and may also you go into the minds and hearts of the congregation Lord and and as we sing Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord may we open oursel up to you father close the world out and Lord commune with you father be with the ones that are sick sister Freda sister Johnny and all the different ones Sister Mary Dy different ones that are not here today Lord we pray that you would put their healing touch on them Lord and bless them Father and take care of them and bring them back together Lord I know they yearn to come to church service father and I pray Lord that you would be with them Father just bless a little bride around the world be with our visitors that are among us today Lord as they uh maybe return back home or return back to their place of worship Lord may they say as the road to EMAs have our hearts not burned today that we've heard the word of the Lord so father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes Lord just be with us through this furtherment this service in Jesus name we pray amen the bride says amen so some of you that are that are that are here as visitors um I'm a little slow southern guy so we're on part 103 that's 103 sermons so it's been a year or so we've been on this on the son of man and we haven't even got to the son of man yet we're actually on the Statue of a perfect man so if you'll just bear with us I'll try to background a little bit but let's read the scripture in the beginning was the word the the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh now 2,000 years ago the word was made flesh amen not all that's not all and the Word was made flesh right here yes sir just as the word was made flesh and dwelt among us there he's here now in the hearts of his Believers making us what him made manifest in another form called The Bride not two different people but these two are one as we were at the U at the wedding yesterday we these two are now one one flesh and the Word was made flesh and that's what we're trying to pick up the thought today and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you can have your seats and we'll finish reading second Peter 1 verse5 says besides this giving all diligence in other words diligence not dilator diligence add to your faith now it's become your faith brother R said this is my eye God gave it to me this is my Holy Ghost God gave it to me it's not his anymore it's mine all right I possess that in my soul so in our soul we're born again but remember the spirit realm or the memories and conscious effects and Imagination that is still bombarded by the devil that is where the greatest battle ever fought is in your mind and it's your memory if your memory don't bother you today then come preach reasoning conscious affs and Imagination all these things are contrary to God or they can be used by God one of the two and we're praying today that if you're born again in the soul you don't have faith and doubt you have faith or doubt you don't have the devil and God you have one or the other today there's no gray area now you can be you can be heading toward the new birth you can be justified you can be Sanctified but without the baptism of holy ghost in your soul to burn that old nature out of you you are of the devil I'm just plain the things I did I do them no more why the thing that made me do it is not in there anymore all right praise the lord we believe in Salvation in this church we believe in Redemption we'll talk about that in just a second but this is a furtherment of the Plan of Redemption not just to get you born again but to get get you an active participant in the economy of God or the plan of God all right you can be born again that's fine but listen we have babies here today and and some very new ones and you know they're sweet and they're lovely and you know we do all the things for them and and they're cute and beautiful but you don't take that baby as soon as it's born and put it in a closet and shut the door oh that's a beautiful baby you know you could probably put a a a window and say oh it's a pretty baby about a month later that baby's going to what die that's right even though it be a human even though it be a baby so we believe in a furtherment of the Gospel in this church we believe in growing in Grace and knowledge as the Bible tells us the only way to do that is by a five-fold Ministry all right Apostles prophets Pastor I'm just telling you what the Bible says can't erase that out of the Bible the Bible says the only way you going to get perfected is by listening to the message of the hour through a five-fold Ministry all right you can get born again listen to tapes you can get bored again reading books if you want to but you cannot grow without a solid Ministry to help you grow now we know that right and besides just giving all diligence add to your faith now it's become your faith that's at the bottom of the pyramid that's your faith yes so you're going to add to your faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge you say brother way I've already got these things the prophet told us yeah you as a baby have every faculty to become a mother or a father but guess what not going to happen till you get older so you're not growing any new parts so in The Bride of Jesus Christ we're not growing any new parts we're just growing in Grace and knowledge we're growing in what God wants us to do we we didn't know when we were a kid that that oven was hot as Josh our son first word he said was hot because the oven stayed on he stayed at Nanny's a good bit Nanny runs them yeah there oven oven you hear that not Michael wave oven okay all right or drive-thru what do you have but he said hot you know why he said hot he touched it one time didn't touch it again but now he's 40 we'll be 40 this year Lord 40 wow yeah everybody go ahead wow but he'll be 40 this year he don't say that anymore he knows it's hot same way with you and I we didn't know what we were doing when we got born again even like yesterday when those listen I'm not laughing for no other purpose but it just shows you one thing you can have a purity in your Humanity amen they didn't even know how to kiss because they' never done it before hallelujah how many y'all can say don't raise your hand your wedding day was that your first kiss nope not my most of you I know Bob and Monica for sure cuz he told us that but they were so awkward but it was so cute and it was so innocent cuz they got married and now they're going to be able to enjoy they don't know what that kiss is now amen and they'll lawfully be able to do what they can do with that kiss amen they can carry it on and that's what with the Lord Jesus when you get born again you're a baby in Christ you make mistakes you fall down you hit the wall uh you throw food you know you you get choked on something but boy as you get older guess what God expects you to walk on your own God expects you to study on your own God expects you to give back to him what he's already give you which is the scripture and the word of God and the message of the hour amen We Believe without the message of the hour you might you might slide in the Rapture but I doubt it don't get quiet on me now we believe that and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance Temperance patience to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and we're heading to that in just a little bit and brotherly kindness charity 1 Timothy 3:16 Says look without controversy listen when the prophet of God came on the earth there was so much controversy Till There Was denominations everywhere and he was preaching to them in their Arenas and in their churches yes amen but now we've come to a place that I don't I know for sure I passed three Baptist Church one of them Jun and I got married in 40 something years ago 43 years ago 44 years ago coming up I'm not going I didn't stop in that church I come to this one why I know that that's not where I need to be I know what the Baptist teaching is a Methodist teaching is and look at the Methodist Church now even our little town of Gillsville 300 people there's a few Methodist churches and one of them suing one one suing the other and they're suing each other and they're not United Methodist Church anymore they have been pulled apart why cuz some say we ain't going to have a gay woman standing in the pull pit and some says well that's okay we can everybody's the same no God gives us a standard and when brother Brown came on the scene that standard was so convoluted that standard was so fogged up he calls it Loose Ends there was so many Loose Ends till to to even a new Christian didn't know what in the world to do but now as the Bride of Jesus Christ in 2023 after 60 something years after the prophet left we are finally seeing that without controversy you don't have to try to prove to me that brother R was a prophet I know that I'm sold out the voice of the day but I know one thing for sure that voice wasn't quite it came and rang out in a group of people called the bride and the bride knows what she's doing with the word today like never before so without controversy great is the mystery of godliness Absolut God was manifest In the Flesh who that's Jesus well yeah that's you too amen justified in the spirit Sint of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on the world received up the glory now great is the mystery without controversy in other words without dispute without quarrel I'm not going to quarrel over you that brother Brown was a prophet or not I'm not going to quarrel over you that there's one true and living God I know there is the Bible backs it up all right I don't want to hurt your feelings but you you've been here a long time you know what I'm saying I don't need a quote to tell me that absolutely it's in my heart this comes from my heart it comes from your heart sure we love the quote you're going to hear me right here there's one right there but I don't need a quote to explain to me what a baptism I can see in the Bible when I was 14 years old wasn't even born again we come in the message you know when I was like 9 8 1968 and I could read the Bible and when I become 14 years old I kind of knew what happened in the garden wasn't an apple that got me in trouble everybody with me so this great Plan of Redemption we're beginning to see more because the prophet tells us and we'll look at that in just a minute and this afternoon um brother Ryan we're going to talk a little bit about choice we're going to slide that in there just a little bit cuz I believe in making a choice I believe in free moral agency I don't believe you came here with eternal life and that's all there is and you're not going to do anything but be you know this and have a halo around your head I don't believe that I don't believe brother rown believe it either because I'm going to read you where brother Brown said God gave you a choice he said you people out here today you have a choice yes choose God or choose death Cain you had a choice if you'll do well listen it wasn't even through a preacher God himself told Cain if you'll do good but if you don't what sin L at the door so you and I we have choices even though I'll read you where brother Brown said God made a choice God didn't have to have us that's right he was self-existent he was Ill on him he didn't need the world he didn't need me and you but you and I were inside of him an attribute born you and I were inside of him in the eternal life that he had to give as a father and as a son and coming down in the Plan of Redemption to be the bloody lamb this was his plan that's right and we're just what we're supposed to get into the plan now remember what is a plan a plan is something that you structure together toward an end yes sir something you put together all of youve made plans house plans plans for your future plans for this plans for that and guess what being human beings they get derailed about as long fast as we write them down is that all right they get just as soon as we write a plan down it changes God's plan never will change so this Plan of Redemption is set in blood yes it is it's a plan like a coach at a football team you know he's got the plan and he he's got a plan to what win I've never seen a coach that went to a football game had a plan to lose he had a plan to win God had a plan to win he had a plan though first to show his attributes down Through the Ages and not just be that we're this you know zombie walking around uh not being able to have our own choice and not be able to have our own free will and to worship Our Father the way we're supposed to everybody with me so this coach has a has a plan and every plan when I play football you you know all the X's and O's were on the board when I was growing up they still had Blackboard sorry about that you're do it on the computer now but most of you that don't know what a Blackboard is and being a teacher's pet wasn't an apple that was taking them erasers and going outside and making all kind of dust everybody know what I'm talking about raise your hand you young people don't even know what I'm talking about you'd come in you'd have chalk all over you you have it on your head you'd have it in your hands but you know what you were the teacher's pet cuz she would use that to erase the board when she was writing stuff on it okay so he put He put a plan up he said we're going to do this we're going to run this we see the weakness of the team and this is what we want to do but you know what that coach couldn't take that piece of paper and go out to the 50 yard line and throw it on the field and win everybody with me it took what execution by him it took an execution of that plan and the coach knew that I'm going to put the best player right here I'm going to put the best player here but the best player here that I know of and listen when God puts the player in place he don't ever change him all right so we're not talking about a plan that we see on television you see well we're going to pass a little bit no we can't pass cuz they're doing this we got to change God never changes that's why I love the word of God it never changes every plan this whole Plan of Redemption never changes now man has changed it that's why I tell you cuz let me tell you there was a a guy named Satan that was his assistant coach he had his own idea though he wanted his own plan so he got his own players and it's been a fight ever since but he just knows he just don't know that he is whipped he's whipped from the beginning so which so so which team are you on today amen if you'll be on the winning team get on the team that executes the word of God his brother Ryan was talking about you know you know you you you got to look at the words I don't I don't like that word execute when they're killing somebody but execution means that you're doing something you're getting something done so we're going to have we're going to execute the plan but remember what we were talking about in the Garden of Eden and this Plan of Redemption we're going to read here in just a little while where we look in the garden and you see two trees now we as um you know looking here and watching like we would a TV screen you would think well one of these trees the tree of life is just beautiful brother Robbie it's just every limb is straight no leaves fall it's so beautiful sunshines on it and it glistens and glows that may not be because my tree of life had a crown of thorns my tree of life had stripes on his back my tree of life had holes in his hands my tree of life had holes in his feet ugly the world didn't want to look on it that's my tree of life but the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil no that's the one with straight limbs beautiful flowers cuz which one did they choose am which one did you choose but now we tell I'll tell you that what the prophet said though it's not the Tree of Life over here and the Tree of Life of knowledge of Good and Evil over here right what did the prophet of God tell us they intertwined their limbs and you couldn't tell one from the other wow that's coming to the end time that's coming where we're going to talk about anoing ones at the end time a little bit later on because when you come to Godliness there is a godliness that you're supposed to be like and then there's a form of godliness that you better not be like but it is a form of godliness but denying the power thereof and that's what Satan did he denied the power of God and he got his own team and he got his own players and he went One Direction but you know what he wants to fight to get back he'll never get back praise the Lord so this Plan of Redemption is for real and it's not something that you got you know I you coach I see the I see the play but I don't want to do that I don't want to do that that was one time make it a little funny that was one time I was I'm the center I was the center of the of the team Center Snapper so this guy runs in from the side we used to run our plays in from the sidelines you'd run an extra you one guy in and one guy out well this guy comes running in he's flying in you know and he comes up and he he gets in line he gets right beside of me cuz he's playing guard he gets right beside of me in the Huddle and we kind of lean over and here's a quarterback silence Rick not it wasn't Ricky then it was Dan he said what's the play he said I forgot I said run something just run something and then when we got and the coach said why' y'all run that play I said coach I ain't going to call his name bless his heart he's not here today he forgot so we just improvised and ran our own play well that's not the way with God we we can't run our own play cuz God's going to say why' you do that that makes it a little Elementary so uh like Ryan I like Ryan how Ryan weaves everything into his life because you know what that's where it's at in the Life brother R said that's where we're losing it too is in that life but we are winning it in that life if we live it correctly under his Plan of Redemption all right and then we'll come to that great as we were talking about the third pull which is pulling us to something it's not pushing us it's pulling us to something all right so brother Brown now how does he how do we know this plan though how do we know this plan's real well that's God he must be no there's a Playbook called a Bible but the master coach stood back before time and by Foreign knowledge by him foreign knowing what you would do he then pulled himself back and predetermined this whole thing now that way I'll agree with you I will not agree with those people says you don't have a choice now brother BR plainly tells us he did not put you in a tube and pull you through it now plainly but you know what that is predestination that's why it's not a good thing to use if you're not knowledgeable right cuz you say oh no cuz predeter predestination is predetermined destiny that means when you got here your destiny was already predetermined now that's absolutely the truth in the mind of God cuz it can't change if God ever loved you he'll never unlove you if he never did he never will I agree with that but listen we got to come down into time time is where Redemption happens time is where he is our father time is where he is our savior our healer Our Redeemer but what's he doing with this plan he's taking us back to the Garden of Eden Before Time ever happened now I'll agree with you there but I will not agree that there's nothing I can do about this is just the way I am y'all know brother Dell hadn't preached that in 50 years one thing's for sure you have a choice of everything you do all right you can believe it and accept this today or you can reject it cuz brother R said by your choice I'll read it this afternoon by your choice that's where he got the quote that we like to quote where he said you either better or worse when you go out that door why cuz you got to make a choice every service we make a choice well I'm just not going to come well that's your choice but you're against the plan see you go back to the plan you're against the plan of God so for knowledge looks back and says that he foresaw this he knows that's the reason he could tell the end from the beginning so he looks all down through your life he sees what you do he sees what what would I do if I didn't even meet you you said oh no that ain't no God is infinite absolutely infinite that means he knows that way that way that way that way what you chose and what you will chose somewhere else some other way wow let me tell you we'll talk this afternoon for some of you that not going to be here there's one thing for sure you did not make a choice to get here you had no choice choice of how you got here that was God's choice he even actually saw your character and put it in a germ in an egg and then met your mama with your daddy and got you here but once you get here that's when your choice begins I'll read it I've got about 10 quotes this afternoon I'm going read where stat said exactly he said God made a choice to get you here you had no choice to get here but God found the character in your mama and your daddy and put them together in holy wedlock and guess what out you came to do what to make a choice now when you got here God knew what choice you're going to make cuz he already saw you getting here that's just to me is a so simple that God saw it all first for knowledge he had knowledge of it beforehand yes sir he knows who's going to go up the statue of perfect man he knows who's not but he makes it available for everyone and these virtues as according to the prophet said in the statute of perfect man these are required listen these are required curriculum if we go to school if we're going to have a plan if we're going to have a plan to graduate graduate is a body change then we got to go through the curriculum that set for for by God Almighty and he does not have books that we don't need I said he don't man does he don't we need the Bible and we need about 1,00 her books to go with that cuz that enhances the Bible and tells you what it says didn't change it prophet of God didn't come here to change the Bible he didn't come here to change the way to be a Christian nope New Birth was way before brother Brown got here her dress was way before brother Bown got here water baptism name of the Lord Jesus Christ way here before brother Bown got here but it had been lost people had got away from the plan they said not I'm going to that Stadium Baptist I'm going to that one Methodist I'm going to that one Pentecostal no you got to get back into one that God fornew would be the right one which is this scripture we're not going to get to anywhere today okay he knew what hour and what day you'd be living in he knew how much pressure you could stand so he puts you in this age to stand the pressure the astronaut pressure you know used to back in the 60s I remember 1969 when they first went to the moon in April I believe it was we were at the Big Bag Cafe up in gamesville and I know some of you well Joyce is not here but Charlotte we may have been there during that time um but we were watching it on television the TV screen was about that big up in the corner in the restaurant and it's all grainy and black and white not HD huge devil not HD but you know what there was a plan for them to get off the Earth whether you believe they went to the moon or not that's your business it don't matter if what I you think or I think if they did they did Brother R said if they go they'll not find anything so okay so way up whatever I don't care I'm not going to argue listen without controversy I'm not going to argue with that cuz there's no basis to any of it let's just say they did go they had to make plans you know how they you know how they made plans cuz nobody ever went up into space and had zero grav gravity right you know how they you know how they trained anybody know underwater they trained underwater they went underwater and it made all that gear lightweight it made them lightweight so they did all those Moonwalks in 20 ft of water but remember that was an intelligence of man what about the intelligence of God that already knew about pressurization then he puts you in this end time puts you in a message church and says here this is the way out of here and let me train you yes come to church read your Bible pray for people pray for each other so brother R says look now God secret mystery so now here's the secret mystery it's been made known cuz now as I see that we we say well we and we put a lot on on brother brandom uh being a prophet I understand that I agree 100% there's no greater man walked on the face of the Earth outside of Jesus Christ but William brandom not a man born of a Woman by sex was ever as great as brother brandham everybody with me all right he wasn't Jesus Christ he wasn't my God still ain't that's right and I say ain't everybody from here well they might know what ain't is not know what but I know the brief of making know what ain't is so back in the back part of God's mind there was something he was going to trying and was going to achieve so to me when God went when God sent the Prophet by prophetic um gift he put that Prophet into the mind of God which was what the totality of the Plan of Redemption everybody with me the totality of the Plan of Redemption the truth of everything predestination one God water baptism all these different things that we take for common told y'all the other day what we discuss in this building what we listen to on tape and and books take 20 people just go up in Gainesville and get 20 people bring them down here and set them down they'll be the most confused people in the world but we're here sitting going Glory that's exactly right that ain't nothing but the truth and them other 20 are going they're crazy and most of them that come in that ain't supposed to be here they usually go out that door or that door pretty quick right we've seen it before amen why because there's nothing inside to respond oh there's something inside to responds all right but it doesn't respond the right way but as the prophet of God what's your point well if brother Brown went back in the back part of God's mind listen he opened the seals but did he close them no he opened the mind of God he opened all these and we walked into it you and I are recipients of a prophet but not just thank God for a prophet now he's gone we're waiting for him to come back to me that's the most lazy people in the world lazy Christians waiting on waiting on somebody to come back I'm not even waiting on the Lord Jesus to come back I'm bringing him back he's here now I'm just waiting to resurrect him inside of here and you where's the resurrection inside of you prophet of God will come out of the ground first to be last last to be first he'll come out of that ground just as sure as I'm standing here but he will only come out when we come to a place that The Headstone in the church has brought Jesus Christ back to the Earth with no death that's through US he say I can't do that way I'm fixing to read you here in just a minute now back to back part of God's mind there was something he was trying what the plan he was going to plan it and what achieve it and he had a motive what's the motive to get us back list has been several thousand years since he communed with Adam in the garden face to face flesh to flesh human human human he can't do that now he has to work through a group group of people through your eyes through my eyes through a five-fold Ministry so he's waiting to see his bride like the armor meat packing gu I'm sure for a year he's like can't wait but I got to wait I told her I'd be back in one year I told i' be back one year and did he come back yes he did same way here but he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed now how is he expressed to me and you everybody with me so now I can't do this I can't had to come from the devil that didn't come from God 1 Corinthians 1:7 so that you come behind and no gift waiting for the coming of the Lord who shall also confirm you confirm you unto the end that you may be what read that with me I make it big so you older people can see it blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ when is that day oh that'll be when we get over here and get a body changeed you better start working on it now God is faithful by whom you were called into the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord now I beseech you brother now I compel with you brother by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing yes boy we got to work on that and that there be no divisions among you well get that in brotherly kindness but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind not your mind his mind be joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment wow 1 Corinthians 6:9 says know you not that the unrighteous now look according to this we're all in trouble cuz I'm going to hit every one of you Amen on know you not that the unrighteous that's enough we're done I don't have to read the rest of them shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators idolators adulterers a feminite abusers of themselves with mankind thieves Covetous drunkers revilers extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God well that's that group out there that we see when we drive by on Saturday they're out there drinking and partying carousing you know making all kind of things you know being lwd being all this stuff U drinking smoking cussing shooting people up you know and and become murders and all that stuff and and Paul says you need to stay away from them people that's just a whole different class of people no it's not let's go to verse 11 and such were some of you Paul turns to his congregation and says I know your life such were some of you but you are washed thank God you are sanctified you are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God Philippians 2:15 that you may be here we go again blameless without spot without wrinkle I can't do that see you're already under the devil's territory that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked I can't make it this nation is so crooked and perverse yes you can John 7 said Lord I pray for them not to get them out of the world but for me to be in them in this world that's right God's not going to put a bubble around you and say well that's my child he's not going or she's not going to have any problems no issues you know when you get born again um all of your um bills go away um you don't have you can go get a car you don't have car payment now John me and you okay and then what's going to happen is your wife's never going to burn anything oh I better go back over here she's never going to buy anything that she she didn't need we're not that way but we think it's a flowery bed of ease but it's not that's when the trials start cuz through suffering as we've for many many times before Perfection you're perfected by suffering if not what would we be thank god brother R said God is not a granddaddy come on I got a grandbaby say well she ain't a baby no more she's 14 all right she's sitting back there brother Robie in the very back the right there yeah that one smart pretty my grandbaby does nothing wrong nothing you're not that way only my grandkids but now I have a son sitting right there beside her he has been wrong from the day he's born he's like his mama see the [Music] difference see the difference though a do old granddaddy God would be he'd let us buy with everything there's nothing wrong everything is good oh that's okay you don't have to come to church if you don't want to you don't have to read your Bible and stud Oh Come that's just somebody's opinion no he says I'll tell you an example When de was a baby I have hunting magazines CU I like to hunt and uh and I was I always get them and sit and read them you know and Di jumped up in my lap one day she was just probably five six years old and she got an ink pen and I had the thing open and I was reading it of course she you know up here like this and I'm like get I'm not I didn't say get out I said come on so so she starts taking an ink pen and she just marks something papers flying everywhere Josh walks by he said D I stop that I said she's mine he said dad what would you done to me I said i' killed you thank God God's not a granddaddy amen don't the old grandpa everything's fine don't worry no you're he's a daddy he's a father that says hey do this because it's in the word of God do this cuz it's my will for you to do this sir get in the plan of God and not be I don't want God to be a do to your granddaddy cuz you know what that makes us lazy dilatory not diligent it makes us not Shameless not blameless but when the character of God comes in us or when he fills somebody with the Holy Ghost that's when the problems begin so the best thing for us to do is have patience we went through uh virtue virtue means strength knowledge is not the knowledge of of the world it's the knowledge of God to know that these things that I'm telling you are right or wrong something's inside of you right now right now see I I just I don't Envy brother Brandon for having discernment I don't want to know what you're thinking about me right now most of you anyway right if I could just read your mind H 10 seconds ago not now everybody's cleared the Slate today but 10 seconds ago what you were thinking about me I don't want to know but God knows but patience I mean knowledge to know that we do have discernment like dad's always said I don't need discernment I can see it on your face if I'm hitting you right between the eyes you know you got both eyes crossed you got that Furrow in your brow everybody with me so knowledge is a knowledge of God knowledge where to go knowledge what to read knowledge what to see and not see knowledge and then having Temperance not just Temperance to just let everything happen no but temp that if something does happen that thing don't rise up inside of you cuz we all got that um look at road rage road ra road rage road rage run rampant somebody kill you if you run them off the road not intentionally you know but they're going to they they'll kill you so that's the temperance of man which is nothing but the temperance of me and you is like Jesus said I forgive you for that hit him on the head Drive the nails to his hands I forgive you you for that so now we're at patience just for a moment and then we'll go to Godliness real quick and we'll have to do that this afternoon hot up here in the New Testament the the word patience is not even in the Old Testament cuz listen without the Holy Ghost you can't have Holy Ghost patience right hello somebody and they didn't have the new birth in the Old Testament there was not spiritual Rudder to make them be patient but when the New Testament comes then Jesus said I've come not just to cover you I'm going to come inside of you and then I'm going to live my patience inside of you and I'm going to live it out all right a man who has not swerve from his deliberate purpose n listen God had a plan a purpose you got to get into it when you do then you'll see the deliberate P purpose that God did these things and his loyalty to Faith and piety by even the greatest what what that's a trial says trials suffering sufferings patiently steadfastly brother R said the statute of perfect man you're beginning to reflect the works of Christ but so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us what about somebody pops up in 1955 and says all right we're going to the Moon just get in one of these airplanes and take off now they want to do the same thing that happened in 1969 they want to go to the moon but they're doing it the wrong way by the time they get in that airplane get about 35 or 40,000 ft up in the air gravity is going to release and they're going to die amen that's the same way brother R's talking here everybody that wants to go out and do their own thing and have something in front of the plan of God but so many of us try the works of Christ before the reflection is in us now there's the trouble now there's the trouble what there's the trouble so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in it now there's the trouble we find those things happening you know what I know it we see these stumbles along the road we find scrap heaps of Ministers of Christians piled along the road is because they didn't go into it right he say Christians he didn't say Sinners he say Christians and that's why I'm here this morning is to try to teach this little church it's why we need teaching teach this little church and myself how that we can become the dwelling place of the Living God that should be everybody's purpose is to be the dwelling place of God this is my beloved Son and whom I'm what please to dwell we'll get to the hear you him it's it's working but but you got to be pleased to dwell first see everybody wants to jump up and be adopted and be you know be a manifested Son of God as a baby power without character is what SAT satanic but Power with character what is charact that's character that is the character that's the stature of a perfect man the Lord Jesus himself the Lord is not slack concerning his promises some men count slightness but longsuffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance brother R said 1960 El Shad now God just look Abraham Abraham's what the father of our faith right and then Abraham we found out didn't obey God just right H remember God said get up and go lot got up I mean he got up and went but he took lot with him out of the will of God right there now watch now he made ready and had faith in the promise but see we can still have faith in the promise and not obey still it hinders us obey what obey what's going what what the word of God says remember what I said uh the quote that I got from brother Donnie he says you only really believe what you obey think about that you only really believe what you obey because if you don't if you don't believe it you're not going to obey it 55 miles speed Z speed limit sign if you believe that the C will make sure you do but look that doesn't do away with that sign that doesn't do away with that law well I'll just get it on for myself I'll just yeah no you're not we can still have faith in the promise and then not obey still it hinders us what did Saul do one time Saul Saul comes up and and Samuel the prophet here we go the prophet of the hour the prophet Propet of the day walks on the scene and says kill them all men women children and those two kings for sure I want them gone right through Samuel the prophet not the do old granddaddy so Saul says I'll take part of that ain't know what he said well no no brother way he didn't say that well yeah he did because he brought him back with him he didn't do what his Prophet told him to do everybody with me he didn't do what his Prophet said do he got him in tryall yes Samuel walks up and says hey what's that out here hey what's them two kings doing in prison I told you to kill them all and praise God he drugg them two kings out cut both their heads off a prophet for not obeying he said to obey is better than sacrifice oh but but brother but brother Brandon we going we going to bring all these or Samuel whatever you want to say we're going to bring all these and we're going to offer all this that's not what the prophet said the prophet God said through the prophet kill them all same way with me and you with all the demons we got to deal with now brother Brown says look patience with what what kind of patience first thing have patience with God if you got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because Faith worketh patience When God says anything you believe it that's all you got patience Isaiah 40: 28 but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as Eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint somebody ought to write a song about that statue of perfect man and we should have patience with one another too yes sir like I've tried to get this message over to the Tabernacle to see that each member of the Tabernacle look becomes this I'm sure he's pointing at that it's hard to do I've tried to have patience now watch he's a prophet they know to a degree he's a prophet because of his discernment but what are they doing about it brother Brown said you read it you can read it behind me how many times has he preached on women cutting their hair painting their face how many times we preach to y'all about not coming to church and all these different things years years years you're just not going to make it this is 33 years brother Dale 50 years women still Bob their hair he didn't change one of them that didn't want to be changed they only obeyed what they believe they didn't believe God said that about them everybody with me you can be silent if you want to I want you to mull that around your head a little bit women still cut their hair you know what he never did away with one denomination right you think with a prophet on the scene come on now with a prophet on the scene that the Baptist was just come right into the message the Presbyterian oh surely the Pentecostal no they got worse he said they got worse as he preached they got worse and then they split off and got Church of God and Church of God of Prophecy and all these different Pentecostal groups now what are you saying brother way it doesn't matter if God himself comes back and tells you if you don't believe it he's not going to override your free more Legacy cuz he's talking to you right now that's what I say about all these people that that uh well I'm going say it anyway then we'll then we'll close you throw bananas at or Rotten Tomatoes after we get done everybody wants brother briam to come back oh he's going to come back he's going to resurrect now if y'all believe that that's fine but I'll promise you one thing if he comes back before this thing's all over with they going to hate him didn't they hate Jesus they hated him listen they hated Lazarus you read your Bible they didn't only want to kill Jesus them scribes the religious people wanted to kill Lazarus why he was alive oh that's not la come on just he looks like brother Brown I just looks like him cuz he's over here telling us we supposed to go to church we're supposed to do all the yeah anyway just have patience we got to all have patience have patience with God have patience with your brother have patience with your sister have patience with your song leader have patience with everybody all right just have patience now listen one more before we close wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and sin which just easily easily beset us and let us look run with patience as I told y'all a few weeks ago now patience doesn't mean go sit down on your couch and wait on God to do something now if we say patience then you say well bro wait I got patience I'm going just go sit down I say the same thing about a job if you want a job if you want a job right brother John you if somebody wants a job pray for me brother pray for me I'm going to go sit in my house and lock the door and turn my phone off surely God will send me a job right down the pipe maybe come down like Santa Claus through the chimney that's about as much as you'll get out of it but if you'll get up off of your can and go fight to look for a job present yourself show yourself as a Christian person show yourself you got some intelligence don't go I work for the Post Office some of y'all don't know that we had a uh hiring thing the other day that this lady comes in she's got green hair from here to this side she's got pink hair from here to this side she's got on clothes that she should applied for another job in Atlanta in the street everybody with me but she comes to an interview and it's surprised why she didn't get hired that's the mentality of the world but that shouldn't be your mentality young kids to get a job you put on your best brush your teeth brush your hair put on good set of clothes stand straight don't slash over and don't go in an interview with your phone yeah I can do that yeah I'm good yeah oh hang on that I hold on this is the way it is Dan how you do that that duck stuff I don't know what I can't even do it to make your lip look big selfies that's our problem we're a bunch of selfies all right let's turn the page run with patience now what that's like running with the football you're running with something you're running with patience now they're not after but I remember you got the other team and and and if they see brother Bob running down the field and he's like this they're not going to chase after him them demons wanton but if you got the football you got that little thing in your hand and you going in running with patience they going to be never seen them T well I have seen them tackle somebody without the ball but usually they're after the guy that's running with the ball in the hand that's the same way with me and you when we come to this stature of a perfect man it's not going to be easy we're going to have patience number one with God but to run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith watch this and then we'll close right here musicians come on who for the joy look the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God Matthew 10:22 say you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved that word endureth means to remain to abide not recede or flee if you have a problem today let's pray about it don't run away from it run toward it the word end means the end to which all things relate the aim or purpose that's why brother Brown comes up to the seventh seal he said the seventh seal is the end of all things you're like no that just Begins the book of Redemption all right everybody with me then godliness we'll get into that this afternoon talk about being like God I can't be like God yes you can cuz brother brandham said if God required it he's got to make a way for you to get it all right and you can't get it on your own right never has been that way and never will be that way let's stand our feet godliness to be like god wow but look reverence respect piety towards God then we're going to look this afternoon because there's going to be some people that have a form of godliness that's going to act good that's going to act seemingly right they're going to intertwine theirself with the bride come on somebody cuz we're going to talk about anointed ones they're going to attack theirself to the bride and you're not going to be able to tell the difference except a revelation of the son of man you cannot you say prove it okay there was 12 people sitting at a table everybody with me there was 12 people sitting at the table with Jesus Jesus starts telling them he stands up he's the what he's not the Son of God at that moment he's the son of man he's God in human flesh he's the son of God in a man so that makes him the son of man all right so the son of man is sitting at a table and and listen supposedly now listen listen to me real real real close supposedly those are his 12 disciples that believe what he says and does what he says that's what a discipled does they weren't that yet they weren't there they didn't have the Holy Ghost so they were wondering well who's the best in the Kingdom who this what are you going to do when you get back do we have to do this do we have to do that Lord who's this person that's going to betray you he said the one that puts their thing in the bowl which would be the bread in the bowl and and probably soop up a little gravy said that's the one that's going to betray me and the Bible says Judas did it and they still didn't know what he was doing but one man did the son of man knew he was fixing to be betrayed all them other 11 had no clue the religious part of the church at the time but now on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came remember Paul Peter stands up and he tells about the one about the one that betrayed Jesus They Knew What Judas was had done then but when they were sitting at that table cuz Judas had a form of godliness and he was so close till they could not tell cuz the Bible says it could deceive the very elect if it were possible that's what we're heading toward that's what we're looking at let's sing a song God bless you thank you for being attentive that will be when my Jesus I shall see when I look upon his face the one who save me by his grace when he takes me by the hand and leads me through the promised land glorious day that will be oh that will all the trials everything you've been through in life it all be is nothing it'll be pure joy and pure peace all the former things will be passed away behold all things will be made new the mind of God will now be transferred to you and I in it fullness and we will be God in another form called his bride it's starting now glorious day that will be sing it to him one more time oh what a day that will be when my J Jesus I shall see when I look that's what we long for to see him be able to touch him not have to see him through the filter of these eyes but see him through the eyes of God yes me through the promised land oh what a day glorious day that will be oh yes oh what a day that will be when my Jus I shall see and I look upon his face Lord that she will be raised up Glory we pray for sister to
