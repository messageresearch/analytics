no island anywhere close to that place but it's called beach town South Carolina now for brother Michael teak is so keep those things in your prayer and also the watch night service but I mean brother jewel will be here for the fellowship means so everybody loved Lord yeah man it's getting close to Christmas time and I was talking to her brother the other day and he said you know what he said being a Christian he said it should be Christmas every day and that's true they should be we got the greatest gift that ever was and and some people you know what some people keep him in a manger some people keep him on a cross but we got him in our heart that same baby that walked on the shores we get they walked they've come and lived and died and come back he's in me and you today he's in same person same guy so when we sing silent night holy night that's where we're talking about the gut when the little man started but you know what he's living in your heart tonight as a full grown man but he had to start as a baby somewhere to be what to be our brother so that he could feel our infirmary so he could feel the things that we go through be a teenager be a little boy and do the things of life but to thank God that we have a God that'll do that you know I was thinking back there in the back to just Regina you know you some people may snicker at a dog having diabetes but it's just as important as the life of that dog just as important you know and what Satan has done and he's put that big demon on us and now he's putting it in the in nature you never heard of a dog being a diabetic 20 years ago 30 40 years ago now Satan has just jumped in there you know it's not God but the whole world is groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God so that little puppy is waiting on us to come to a place and I believe that we're heading in the right direction so let's bow our heads and let's all pray for brother Lewis and sister Christine and the girls and Freddie tell have a safe trip they're just right in the front of it they've got two more weeks to go or more to go so let's just keep them in our prayers listen let's bow our heads the Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for bringing us to this place Lord in the middle of the week so that we can get a little charge we can recharge our batteries Ord and look to you the author and finisher of our faith Lord knowing that there's a brother in our fold that has give his time and his effort to go to South America to speak to the chosen bride of Jesus Christ so I prayed this your breast bless brother Lewis give him fruit for his labor father be with sister Christine and the girls Lord just put a hedge around them so they're nothing to bother them the whole time they're there Lord and that they'll come back and give us a wonderful report about what things you have done through your people father forgive us of our sins now tonight be with us in this building Lord we brought our little licks of fire Lord maybe put them together and Lord may it burn within each one of us tonight and learn more about you father we ask you to just bless us forgive us of our sins we were the ones that are sick in the building the ones that are not here the ones that are listening in Lord or watching him we pray that you would just give them Lord a recharge in their life that you'll bless them father and just be with them and give them revelation more than anything Lord just be the active participant in this service you do the speaking you do the hearing Lord and you're the only one that can do the revealing father just be with us now and the furthermore this service in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen all right tonight we're gonna take the fifth seal again as we were before but what we're going to do tonight is is we're going to look at we're going to background just a minute but we're going to look at the transgression what put Israel in its place because they were the bride of Jehova I'm gonna read your script where he says I was married to them in other words I were gonna read it here in Ezekiel that that he pretty much he said I found you naked I found you you were bloody and you were this and you were that and I clothed you I watched you did all these things and then see what you did to me so I had to put you away and give you a writing of divorcement but you know what and to see the grace of marriage and divorce to me I have to see the fifth seal to see the grace of marriage and divorce because God had Grace on those people brother Danny he just didn't kill him and kick him out no he put a place for him there's really two places for them there's the Jew over here actually there's three there's a Jew that's gonna be born again that receives God receives the Holy Ghost in their soul there's a Jew the 144,000 that's gonna be after we leave that's gonna receive this message by the fifth Elijah and receive the Holy Ghost and then then there's that fifth seal group that's gonna be given eternal life and they don't have nothing to do with that God's gonna do it for them and that's the one we're gonna talk about tonight so in other words let's let's read revelation 6 and then we can be seated when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God now watch the wording here and for the testimony which they held not the testimony of Jesus Christ and they cried see that these people didn't know about him and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true just I'll not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth they they've got a little bit of temperance that they didn't get rid of while it was over here all right and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest for yet a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled you may be seated in the Lord I just blessing to the reading of the word now tonight we're just going to kind of review real quick we know one thing's for sure that we are Gentiles we are not Jews you know and it's okay to to look at the types and the shadows and and pretend you're Jew but it's just pretending you can't be a Jew okay you're a Gentile I'm talking to you in this building they may be one of the line that's watching this listen Jew by heritage but I you have to say that sister Gina because you never know you know but these people that are sitting in this building have no they're not full fledged 100% juice so I'm not talking to that I'm talking to the Gentiles you and I did not have a promise you and I at first were not married to Jehovah we had nothing to do with Jehovah we were actually listen to me through the Old Testament only just a few times does the Gentiles look like they're on the Jews side I said look like because they're Gentiles they're dogs Jesus called them dogs okay the Old Testament called them don't you know they they really just didn't like anybody that wasn't you alright so there was a separation and even God said separate yourself don't even marry see that was the problem with Balaam Balaam couldn't curse Israel because Israel had the blessing on them but what did bail them do that shrewd devil inside of Balaam said okay I'm not going to curse them but you know what I'm gonna send some real good-looking Moabite women and I'm gonna send some real good i'ts down there some K nights and some highlights and some Jebusites and I'm gonna mingle with them and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to cause them to commit adultery so he got him one way or the other he got him he just didn't get them the way the way that that Balaam and him wanted to get him at first cuz he wanted to call whoever that was Baylock wanted to call down curses on Israel and just destroy the whole nation Balaam said I can't do that I can't curse at something that God's blessed and when you still can't curse something God's blessed look at that little compared to the world Israel is not even a pimple it's not even a period at the end of a sentence compared to this whole world but they stand alone and nobody messes with them hardly a man why because that's that's God's land you know we talk about the star thing about this other day we talked about the the son of man son of God son of David but now brother branham interjects one in there son of Abraham because son of Abraham I'm going to read it here in the minutes and I'm gonna talk about son of Abraham but what God did God said I'm going to disperse you because of your adultery but I'm going to bring you back to my lent to your land that I give you so that little spot over there in Israel is their land that's the Royal grant that Abraham brother I mean brother brother Jesus brother Jehovah told Abraham where every year I'm getting old gene wherever your feet walk that's your land okay so wherever he walked that's where Israel are the children of Israel they're gonna get their land they're not gonna get you know Reubens not going to get China you know Benjamin's not gonna get the United States that's for Gentiles that's for the bride but they're going to get their spot in what Israel or Jerusalem they have their spot that God had told them they were going to get so now they're dispersed but now what they're coming home to come back to the homeland cuz the only way they're going to get blessed is to be in the homeland all right so we got to bring this Jewish part in here but remember just review the police up on the board because the first four seals happen during the church ages that all right say man we've we've been one year on this so you ought to be able as soon as I say that you should say yeah that's exactly what it is one year we started in February of last year I know I'm slow pull that up on the board please well steal number one white righteous Church seal number two a Red Horse seal number three a black horse and look at the what we've got is them as the to me this is your seal to me this is your Thunder that's what it's telling that's the unwritten part justification is though you never did it sanctification through the statue of a perfect man and the new birth our adoption not this new birth down here remember we received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry father father but that's not crying up here the where the where the disciples were they weren't crying to God all the time silver and gold have I none but such as I have I give unto thee that's not crying that's authority but now they didn't come to to adoption like we know adoption like brother Branham came to adoption and we've come into adoption to where the heads because they didn't get the headstone they didn't get the head to headstones rejected it only come back under the son of man ministry and this endtime in this age just like we were talking about last Sunday or something yeah Sunday before last Sunday ten full life when we see the Son of God dispensation down through the seven Church ages when we come into the Son of Man revelation it has to be a different thought process so if not you're going to miss they miss Jesus with the same old trick remember I was doing this with the same old tradition they call Jesus a demon God came just like the Bible said he was gonna come and they called him a devil so why we keep doing this we need to turn and go this way a new thought process not not a new revelation or a new Bible or no same Bible we have not read a strange scripture in a year for them it might have not been revealed to us yet but it's not a strange scripture so it's not a scriptures I pulled out of the air somewhere amen so seal number four is the pale horse which is all the riders mixed together the Antichrist is gonna make his ride he's gonna have his superpower that side that seal has been broke and the underlying meaning is is when we come to this fourth seal and get a revelation of all this together death will be destroyed the word will be made flesh and we'll take a body change because the bride is caught up in seal number four not seen again until she comes riding back in the Millennium with Jesus Christ in revelations chapter 19 is that alright say ma'am amen alright so the rest of that you said well what do we need to do just tear that out know we get wet remember we're always spiritual Israel always we get the spiritual part of Israel and then because remember you and I can top the fifth seal Jew you and I can type it because did you want Christ did you want when you walked in sin you didn't say a man died on the cross and gave me eternal life did you say that no you didn't cuz I didn't either and be honest you didn't care cuz if you'd have cared you wouldn't have done what you did let's just be honest let's just get down where we live all right I wasn't thinking about the cross when I was doing the things I was doing if I would I would have went to the cross and finally one day when God knocked I believe for the last time I believe I responded and that's to me what happens to all of us we responded and then we responded to what the Word of God some preacher somebody told us and it sparked something in our life that now we look to Calvary every day we live under Calvary every day we didn't before neither that's the fifth sealed you remember we put we put the altar here put the fifth sealed you under that altar well the altar listen like I said before and those you weren't here this is not the altar this is the place to come for prayer sure but this is a Methodist tradition to come up here to an altar to be prayed for I read you all the quotes and I hope it didn't hurt your feelings cuz object the Prophet said I didn't get mad at him but the altar the altar is the cross we all live under the altar of the cross looking to what Calvary did for us and even the souls under the altar that was in the sixth dimension amen the ones that brother Branham saw went across the curtain of time he saw them in the sixth dimension the angel called it souls under the altar well it's not the fifth seal sold under the altar but what was it it was he said well where's Jesus he said what he's a little higher because this cross now that man that hung on that cross he's got an eternal body now he's got an eternal glorified body he did not have it when he was on Calvary dying but in the resurrection he comes up with a glorified body never to die again never to suffer again remember the Bible said he suffered once for all but what do we do we put him back on the cross what was it brother Brown said that what the Catholics if somebody couldn't get him off the cross we always look at Jesus on the cross no I look in an empty cross in an empty tomb he's not there he's reside ycq the living among the dead why do we do that when he's right here the same man that died the same man that rose the same man came back on the day of Pentecost is the same man that lives in my heart in your heart if you're born again tonight so we're under the altar of what God did for us he gave his soul a ransom Isaiah 52 he gave his soul ransom so he could see us what seed you and I spiritual multiplication not natural I'm looking at natural multiplication but that inside man didn't have to have a man and a woman an inside man had a man that could speak Satan can't even do that he has to borrow a body he has to incarnate we're not going to this time anymore money no but we're under the altar of what God did for us and we're not in a glorified condition the sixth seal people are not in the gorton sorry the sixth dimension people are not in the glorified condition they're in theophanies but they don't have an eternal human body like the flesh right the bow right with that so they're right here they're under an altar because remember brother Branham said and I'll skip the quote if you don't mind he said I want to see him the angel said you can't see him he's a little higher what he's in the seventh Inchon where only one man has reached immortality one man so I listen I don't you give me whatever quotes you won't you give me whatever man says the Bible says only one man has reached immortality there's only one empty tomb every other tomb has got something in it or the Bible's wrong amen now they're waiting somewhere even listen even you may not agree with this but even in the bosom of Abraham was just a place that they put the soul with that God put the soul waiting a time for Calvary they weren't eternal no how could the Witch of Endor call an eternal person back into this dimension no brother Brown said that was under the boy of the bulls and goats that she could do that can't do that now but when she brought him up he wasn't a young man he was the way he died why do you call me and the Witch of Endor said oh man that Samuel brother branham said it she looked at him and said he had still had the prophets robe on he looked just like he did when he died so you can tell then that wasn't a glorified theophany that was eternal so anybody in the Old Testament under bulls and goats their soul had to go over into a place of holding called Abraham's bosom and had to wait until Calvary then Calvary was emptied out and whatever you want to say they didn't come back and get a human body they couldn't have because they without us cannot be made perfect our brother branham or that angel would have had this table now brother brown nice people up there with him no he said you can't go there he's a little higher well man how much higher can you get well your glory five buddies how high is the highest point you can get and that's what we're heading toward a glorified body not this body but this body made new a man this body considering Redemption so everybody's under an altar not an altar the Bible says the only altar you have is your altar of your heart right an altar of flesh cuz Ezekiel when we read it in just a few minutes Ezekiel says I'll give you a new heart here sell give me a new altar he said I'll give you a new heart all right so this fifth seal Jew is one that has been put in a place if you want to pull that back up brother Joe or whoever back there I'm gonna pull that back up we'll look now when we get to the fifth seal like I said a couple Sundays ago when we get into this fifth seal we've got to lap it back underneath because we went through the church ages thereby alright with them there's your church ages seven of them it started at Calvary let's don't be technical it started at Calvary I know it started an eighty thirty something and went a little bit later when the Holy Ghost fell but that's the time we're looking at when Jesus died on the cross what happened that Holy Ghost came back on the group of believers called the bride that was his new bride that was his new bride that wasn't his bride in the Old Testament that was his new bride he had divorced the old bride and took the new bride and remember she won't do like the first bride did that's why he took her now sure they went off into the denominationalism and things like that but he's gonna have a true bride it's not got her skirts not gonna be defiled and that's where we are we're right about the I told you were right about that little dot right there and that's where we are so we've had four seals then we've had a rapture now the fifth seal is to truly when we leave its to the Jews and the Jews only right only to the Jews but you can't leave it over here for us because then we need to throw five six and seven out the door because when I'm gonna be here no what are we doing we're going to take this and we're going to put right back here the fifth seal happens well we can put it around here cuz it happens right here in this time here all right do we okay with that so now the fifth seal to us then the thunder under the fifth seal is not left us the souls under the altar it's that we're there so justified listen if God's justified them and they don't care nothing about him what about a group of people hallelujah that he justifies that really won't it they really know how how he did it and how he coming the whole plan of redemption the real you never did it that's what we got to say regardless of whether we get older or whether we get sag that doesn't matter the real you never did it if he did you couldn't get to that place you got to start all back over again because it can't be a spot they can't be a blemish they can't be nothing held against that person inside of you if you born again to not there is nothing nothing there is no dark spot there is no anything the only thing is going to hinder you is what I'm looking at right now amen that person inside of you can create a world we read it and go live on it if you weren't barred by these first three dimensions that we're in right now a lifeline didn't matter so I said when we get to this fifth seal you've got to enter into another dimension another another thought process because when John went to the fourth seal he saw there was no more beast and then he says the fifth seal when the fish Hill opened I saw souls under the altar so he had to see into another dimension because they're not in this dimension they're in another dimension somewhere in a theophany waiting I believe they're waiting on me and you cuz I'm going back to Hebrews 11:40 they without us can I be made perfect now they're crying how long how long to avenge our blood now they're waiting on the 144,000 but who's the 144,000 waiting oh let's just throw it all the way back anyway no nice to get out of here they cannot they can't one of them get saved while we're here but you gotta remember 144,000 and two the two prophets they gotta be saved you know they gotta be they got to be saved to give salvation to the Jews but they're waiting on us to get out of the way so that God can deal with them now that's God telling him I'm gonna bring you back into this land and I'm gonna do all these things for you but I'm gonna read you what he did mm-hmm what he told them now let's skip some of this if you don't mind I think we've we know that this is the seals are a plan of redemption it's not just sealed one two three four five six seven and it's the breaking of the seal sure that was already broke Jesus preached him 2,000 years ago and broke the airwaves and said this is what this seal is then we had a prophet come along in the endtime and God came to that prophet amen and broke those seals every day totally different than what he believed a man remember he was heading in this direction the angel turned him in this direction so you and I what's going to happen to you and I we can't keep going in this direction we got to go in this direction and you know what if you're born again and we're going through all these statue of a perfect man and we're growing in grace and knowledge then we've got to come to a place to where we do see that the real you never did it and there's not a hint of sin anywhere in that person you are because I'm telling you if there's a hint of sin and that in that fifth seal Jew how can he get a white robe and I say he now now listen I say he but there's there's women in there too okay and I was asked this question one time before because remember in the Old Testament they didn't count the lineage of the women so really it's really if you technically see 144,000 people being saved that's the men of the household that's not counting the women in the children so there's more than 144,000 that's going to be saved but it's got to go by what the 12,000 of this tribe 12,000 this trouble and it was the men didn't count the women and children it was the men so see we're looking at a bigger group but God's got to save that man first they got to hear the gospel and the read they not gonna hear it listen you come to church next Sunday you know one thing's for sure Israel's not gonna hear from God the 144,000 if you come to church so in the afternoon no one thinks for sure the 144,000 they're not going to hear from God you come to church next Wednesday night can I keep going okay nevermind so when you walk through that door you remember one thing's for sure while you're here they're not getting anything so you and I are holding this that alright if you look at it that way maybe we'll see it a little different with every time we walk in bro the board what we're doing we're pushing time we're pushing time we keep pushing time but one day you know what one day time will be no longer somebody will come to that place and God will rapture group of people and he will go to the Jews he promised he would he said he was gonna do it but you and I have got to get this lined up and I believe we're doing it I believe we don't wonder I ain't gonna water up here Bob's not here okay can somebody get me a glass of water a bottle of water for I'm gonna drink out when Lauren's got in her hand yeah I'm just kidding just kidding I know you would I know I know you would it's okay all right let's go - I don't have to read all these cuz remember brother branham always thought before we went across the curtain of time his thought process was that if he went to wherever he died and went to heaven him and brother Neville couldn't shake hands they could talk to each other but they'd just pass by each other nothing solid oh I don't have to read all this then now but remember for God to set him up to see this fifth seal Jew and then for him to go across the curtain of time he had to go across the curtain of time to see that those people are real that's what he says right here they're real I can feel him I could hear him I could see him I could touch him there were real people but then God had to show him let's go ahead and go to number four and read in the fifth seal said now in the ninth verse souls under the altar now here's where I was going to get some real disagreement thank you buddy but just watch this for a minute I thought that too but it didn't come that way I've always thought that those souls under the altar were the martyrs of the other church now what brother Branham was doing he was looking here goes everybody this died is under that altar of the cross there in the six dimension but that's not the fifth sealed you remember the fifth seal Jew doesn't come until after we're gone that the revelation comes now you understand that the revelation of the fifth seal Jew because remember they're already there the fifth seal Jews already we're there got where they're at because brother Brown said that's right the ones who were killed under Eichmann and Hitler and all those people all the way back to right here I believe right so there weren't they're actually in a place and they're beings they're theophanies because remember they talked to John I just read it they said how long how long to avenge our blood all the ones that are what they did it to them while they were on the earth so they got knowledge they're people that's our problem we thought well we die we get lesser we get more we get less because we're so what no no listen that releases that eternal life that's in you and that's the greatest thing so he thought it was the murders of the early church but it was not so he was going in this direction and got stood up that's a whole different group and the reason it's a whole different group is because I'm gonna give you a revelation of this fifth seal I'm gonna give eternal life to a group of people that don't even know who I am amen the fifth said you look to get this out of your head the fifth seal Jew it's not the 144,000 the fifth seal Jew is not anyone that's died since Christ will now that has the baptism of the Holy Ghost in there so everybody got that same am it's a special I mean a special group of people but now who are you what are you you're a special group of people that God's put in this dimension to get them out of that dimension because remember they ain't gonna stay in that fifth dimension all the time they're coming out they're gonna be where we can see them I thought so myself but when the Holy Spirit showed the vision it wasn't it isn't the soul now he's not saying it is at the souls they are sold it's not the souls of the born-again believers that have died and went on so you got to take them out from the church ages that's what I said we gotta have a different table take them out of the church that's not that group of people the fifth seal Jew has its own place amen right the fifth seal Jew and they are Jews there's no Gentiles in there because look if you turn card down in the end of Gentile dispensation you're gonna be judged by what you do good or bad ugly or good you're gonna be judged if you're not born again if you're born again you are the one that's doing the judging okay but now this fifth seal Jew died because they were Jews they died one thing only they were killed because they were Jew period Hitler said I don't want to see another one kill them all six million that's half of the population of the state of Georgia right now half a population state of Georgia he destroyed wipe them off the face of the earth Eichmann and Hitler and all the ones that different ones coming down through there and even that ain't even counting that was just six million Jews that were killed right here actually about right here right at the beginning of the church age because it was in the 40s 30s and 40s they were killed right that's not even counting all these other Jews that we're back to here they got killed just because they were Jews because listen this is not a new thing of being persecuted the Jews Jews have been persecuted since they since they let look 80 70 when Titus came in they eat their kill their eat they eat that you eat the bark off the tree they eat their children because they didn't do what God said to do God said when you see them come pass about get out of there brother Ram said there wasn't any born-again believer see they got a revelation of what God had already said they got out of there but the ones that stayed in there died because simply they were a hard-headed you and I'm gonna I don't believe they'll you know they were hard-headed they didn't listen to one gon said and you know what God had to destroy him because they didn't do what he said so he let Titus a Gentile general come in and kill him on til what they said the blood run out the streets they killed him so many of them inside that city but remember we're gonna we're gonna read one scripture here at the very end that when we're gonna start next week we're gonna talk a little bit about Daniel seven two weeks because they stood up at Calvary and said let his blood be on us and our children brother Brown said that's where they made their most fatal mistake as they said let it be on us and our children well what's the children they said it right here and it continued on all the way to right here two thousand years of killing because a group of people said let his blood be on us and our children amen but God through Daniel seven to eight said I'm gonna do away with all that finish the transgression make an end of sin make reconciliation for iniquity amen that's what's happening now that's why I said the six the six fold purpose of Daniel shows the redemption of the Jews the six fold purpose of the six seals to us Gentiles shows our redemption because you don't get Redemption in the seventh seal you're already redeemed amen and when Christ comes down to get the 144,000 and they go they gotta take a body change somewhere because they're going in another dimension amen all right they're not souls of the bride Church we thought that was the bride Church waiting their souls in the ultra seat crying how long how long no that's not it brother Brown says right here is not the souls of the bride Church so this fifth seal Jew is not bride totally different group of people all right now that was number four let's don't read the rest of it let's go on down to number five where brother Brown says hey I thought me and brother Neville could we just be we just be you know in other words spooks floating around with no with no substance you could talk to each other but you couldn't touch each other but that's not true we know that remember that was grandma's you know really grandma's up there now walking the streets of gold with Jesus no she's not but you know what how long have we been taught that I looked at the guy the other day and then we're talking - we were at - eating at our postal Christmas dinner or not oh I told the postmaster he was talking about kids telling lies I don't know if the Lord let this happen but in comes Santa Claus right Jim this guy walks his go prayer short so he went been in the North Pole but he had the beard and the hair and the red belly the red and I looked at Don and I said you talk about lying I said right there's the greatest lie that this world has ever known and we told it to our kids and I'm not going in further with that just in case you know I don't want go any further but I'm telling you don't look at your kids like that bunch of liars you lied to them first hohoho right you know what the whole world got sucked into that the whole world you know there's a Chinese Santa Claus Thomas right who told you that your mama and your daddy but you know what my point is you see how if you keep telling something long enough it just becomes natural it just becomes a you know I mean who in the world would believe that a man could be in 65 billion places at one time at midnight on Christmas Eve but yet we what we believed it Susan that don't happen okay nope so brother Ram goes across the curtain of time but let's look at number seven and they will we're gonna read some scripture for about thirty minutes and then we'll be done number number seven please and when we die our souls go under what the altar of God so when you in the sixth dimension it is the souls under the altar but it's not the fifth sealed you alter that okay with that the ones that died are under this altar this altar of a church age right here souls under the altar they're not crying how long to avenge our blood there'll actually going how long are you all going to stay here take your finger do that everybody take your finger do that turn around go like you right here okay that's why they're not here that's why they're not complete that's why they're crying how long how long but this group over here though is is crying how long how long to avenge our blood so it's not the same group it's a totally different group that's why I'm telling you you and I have to be a totally different group in this end town don't try to separate yourself let God do this separate don't walk around think well I got this son of man revelation nothing can bother me were you fixing to find out but you know one day somebody is gonna be able to stand and death is going to go up their sleeve and and you know what I'm not quoting brother branham I'm telling you that that's got to be destroyed in a group of people so who is it live people yes not dead people people this past oh no and watch they did they're not dead they're more alive than we are we're the ones dying why don't watch it we're going to go to funeral somebody died no they didn't die if they're born again they more alive than we are we're the ones are dying see how what I mean we gotta get in this way because look brother I'm setting the power that'll raise us up is riding us now we are now in heavenly places we are now in the power of the Resurrection if there wasn't a law to that sons and daughters of God we create them a world out here and go live a private life on it you have the power and you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of God in you you've got power to do it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a word and lose this and go live on a hallelujah there you are everybody all right with that so now let's look at the seal real quick pull up the next one please and then we'll we'll read some scripture so remember we've got to we got to touch the seal here because that's what we've been talking about the whole whole service up to now and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held now that's not this group right here this group is here for the testimony of Jesus Christ hey buddy look at me right here this is for the testimony of Jesus Christ not to testimony the hell what is the testimony they held I'm a Jew God I am God's chosen remember what Gershon our rabbi Richmond said I can't help it God made me and you he made me this way and he gave me these promises and that's what I'm gonna live under and you know what that's gonna get him somewhere if you and I would live under the promise that he gave us just say it and they cried with a loud voice so they could speak and they had intelligence they know they're in another dimension brother John because they said how long does thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth they weren't dwelling on the earth they had at one time but they had passed on they were in another dimension they're over here and something they can see how long O Lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood now that's not these people then that's this people and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth what the Eichmann's the Hitler's all the ones that killed the Jews they're all right and white robes were given under every one of them listen you're sitting here tonight born again you have your white robe on right now the only way you're going to get a white robe it's not in that dimension for sure but you got to come back here and the body you send in and somehow God is going to have Grace on you and give you eternal life I don't think I want to take that chance I mean listen we know there's a lot of people going to be given eternal life that for people to being good for being good to the bride we know that but don't think for one thing you sit in this building and say I think I'll just be good to Jeannie and Larry and I go - give me eternal life no you know what God knows your heart he knows your intention he knew your intention before you got here so don't fool with God you're not gonna be you're not gonna plead ignorance at the judgment you're not the world may somebody in the world MA but you're not so the only the only people that are going to be given white robes are the people that are given eternal life at the white throne which could be the hundred and forty I'm at night I'm sorry forgive me to fit the Jays sorry the foolish Spurgeon I keep forgetting Thank You genie you want to preach the rest of this for me the foolish virgins they'll be given eternal I would say that's white robes were given to them but they'll be given to them as a judgment bar these are not gonna go to judgment oh my so why doesn't this type of us bow down they don't go to judgment they're giving it they're givin white robes and they don't go to judgment do they don't look at me with your eyes wide open they don't go to judgment if they go to judgment God's got a judge them for being a human on the earth and drinking smoking cursing you know the laundry list it up because they turned him down same way with me and you you and I but our eternal life comes here there's has to go and be given in that dimension whatever dimension they're in and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them in other words God is speaking to them and telling them that they should rest for a little season in other words come down come down Jim the hot-headed you calm down it's what brother Brown : calm down for a little season what this season right here 2,000 years settle down until their fellow-servants which is the ones that are get them killed own into our day and their brethren because remember when John sees this pay attention when John sees this in time it's right here on the Isle of Patmos 1819 whatever they haven't even been killed yet a lot of them but probably 99% them hadn't been killed yet so this is what this is in another dimension this is looking what to the Future a vision because look they most of them the biggest part of them were killed right in here so they weren't John is not talking to them people it says and it was said unto them John couldn't tell them John's not God so I believe God told them just hang on a minute stay right where you're at until your feathers fellow-servants and also your brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled in other words when 144,000 gets killed then we'll see something take a look take take hold ok so that was the souls under the altar they were there for the word of God what the Word of God says they're Jews I'm a Jew I'm God's chosen people alright cuz I'm gonna read it here tune just a minute the testimony they held they were Jews how long did judge and avenge our blood so it couldn't be the bride cuz you and I are crying Grace and they're not but they're getting the greatest dose of grace you'll ever see in your life white robes were given unto them wait for a little season so their fellow servants and brethren she'll be killed now now let's look at the at the transgression we got to go all the way back to the Book of Jeremiah we got just a little while we're just gonna we're gonna read alright so this is where they begin this is where God says I'm married to you you are my wife Israel all of jewelry you're my wife and I love you watch this right here well we're not this one but the next one what's the Lord said unto me the days of Josiah Josiah and the days of Josiah of the king how stout seeing that which backsliding Israel hath done now this is the Prophet Jeremiah looking and prophesied to Israel the Lord said unto me in the days of Josiah has now seen which that backs line is will have done she has gone up upon every high mountain and under every Green Tree and there hath played the harlot and I said after she had done all these things turned down unto me but she returned not and her treacherous sister Judah saw it now I'm not going to spend too much time on that but remember Judah and Israel split for a time and they had two kings they had a king of Israel then they had a king of Judah but now they got to bring it back together because it's not split they split it because of what because they because they didn't like each other one done right that was humanly they were split but watch she's returned her treacherous sister Judah saw it and I saw when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away and giving her a bill of divorcement yet her treacherous sister Judah fear denied in other words she didn't fear she went played the harlot also so they're all in one big pot okay but now remember him according to the New Testament and even according to the Old Testament if you caught your wife committed adultery obviously in the Old Testament they killed him them in the lover but you couldn't take that woman back she's she's polluted and I'm will read in just a minute she's polluted herself so you can't take her back but now look at the grace of marriage and divorce because God's not gonna take her back as a wife though but he's gonna take her but he is gonna take her back as a servant alright so she got a lower position but he didn't kick her in hail either alright watch and it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom I'm going to say some worse than that I'm sorry that but it's in the Bible that she defiled the land now she defiled the land that land is sacred to God the very dirt like I said before all in the world wouldn't know where that new City was going to push up brother Branham said it was right under where Moe Cassidy and and Abraham took communion they were standing on the peak of the new city Abraham was looking for a city all he had to do was dig down maybe a couple of hundred feet need to find the top of it but it wasn't time hey men committed adultery and I had put her away and giving her a bill of divorcement you know treacherous sister Judah fear not and went and played the harlot came to pass through the lightness of her hoard them that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and was stopped and yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not turned unto me with her whole heart but faintly sayeth the Lord and the Lord sent unto me the backsliding Israel has justified herself boy don't do something like us come on doesn't it sound like us the backsliding Israel has justified herself more than treacherous Judah go and proclaim these words toward the north's in other words he is God is sending Jeremiah to tell Israel this and say return thou backsliding Israel saith the Lord and I will not cause look I will not cause my anger to fall on you you have an option Cain you have an option spoke a word Church we still have an option it's called free moral agency amen I will not cause my anger to fall upon you for I am merciful saith the Lord and I will not keep anger forever only acknowledged on iniquity that thou has transgressed against the Lord thy gone and have scattered thy ways to the strangers on their evergreen tree and you have not obeyed my voice saith the LORD turn o backsliding children says the Lord for I am married unto you and I will take you one of a city and two of a family and I will bring you to Zion in other words I'll bring you right back I'm gonna restore you right but watch let's go to Ezekiel now this is gonna be some hard reading but we're gonna read probably 30 verses that all right okay cuz we're gonna because this is this is what happened during the time of Israel's backsliding condition now when I pass by Li and looked upon thee behold thy time was the time of love he's in love with him and I spread my skirt over then covered thy nakedness yeah I swear unto thee and entered into a covenant with thee saith the Lord God and thou became us mine ain't that beautiful then I washed him with water yea I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee sanctified him and I nor did they were the oil I clothed thee also with broader dworkin shod thee with badger skin and I girded the about with fine linen and I covered thee with self he loved this person whoever this is I meant I decked thee also with ornaments and I put bracelets upon thy hand and a chain on the neck and I put a jewel on my forehead and earrings in my earring beautiful crown upon that head thus was thou decked with gold and silver and the arraignment was a fine linen and silk and brought at work thou did a state fine flower he didn't forget about their eating either thou needest eat fine flour and honey and oil and that was the exceeding beautiful and though did it prosper into a kingdom wow it's looking good for these people for right now and thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty remember when Solomon took over there was so many years of hundred years or so or longer that there was no war had one of the greatest kingdoms had all the gold had all the silver had all brother brown said that was their millennium in the Old Testament remember he said down all right for it was perfect through my comeliness God made them that way which I had put upon thee saith the Lord but that Lord but but thou didst trust in thine own beauty and place the harlot because of thy renown and poorest out there fornications on every one that passed by as it was and of thy garments thou did is taking decades to high places with divers colours and play this the place the harlot there upon the light things shall not come neither shall it be so thou has also taken thy fair jewels of my gold it's what God give them you've took what I give you and you've defiled the whole I mean you well we're going to read it now has taken that find early golden my gold and my silver which I had given thee and made us to the images of men and did us commit whoredom with them now for those of you that are young they weren't all committing physical adultery they were they were sacrificing sacrificing to other gods setting up images taking the gold that God had given and making golden images and they were worshiping that image as it were God right so that's what the whoredom was they weren't they weren't true to their husband they went over and played what with the devil all right so just just to explain that they didn't all were just a bunch of prostitutes but in the spiritual realm they were prostituting their self before God and got in trouble for it and took his type broader garments and covers them and they'll have set my oil and mine incense before he they used the very old God give them in their in their sacrifices and they were not to God they were to what other gods you know he said behold o Israel thy God is one they forgot that because they made him many what have we done behold o Gentiles your God is one now we got three well I mean we don't but the world you know the world bounds to that to the whole world bowels of Trinity my meat also which I give the fine flour and oil and honey wherewith I fed day now has to even set it before them for a sweet savor what they're giving them to other countries God said don't do that separate yourself that's why we should be separated from the world God give us all these great things that we have maybe not gold and silver you understand what I mean but I'd rather have the gold of God than to have the gold of man because you know what the gold of man we're gonna walk that's pavement when we get the glory we're gonna walk on what man's killed us killed for all these times on the earth we're gonna walk on it my meat also which I gave you fine flour oil and honey where when I fed thee thou has to even set it before them for a sweet savour and thus it was it's the Lord God moreover thou has taken thy sons and my daughters now look this is how defiled they were because it doesn't say this here but there was some God named Moloch and they worship Moloch so much that when you read in the scripture where it refers to they put their sons and their daughters through the fire they sacrificed their children literally took their children and sacrificed them every month or every year to this God called Moloch that's what he's talking about right here more over than I was taking my sons and my daughters and thou hast borne unto me that was God's kids that got God's people and these have staff sacrificed unto them to be devoured it is of thy whoredoms a small matter that they'll have slain my children and delivered them to cause him to pass through the fire for them that's the Moloch who whatever he was he was a strong demon because everybody worshiped him even Israel started worshiping but why do each upstart why did Israel start worshipping because they turned from God okay and in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou has not remembered the days of thy youth when thou was naked and bare and what's polluted in thy blood remember I read that in Scripture in the very top he's reminding them of what he done what he took them from the world and made them a nation give them a spot of land to live on give them honey give them all give them wine and sit here if you'll do this right here I'm gonna make a covenant with you if you'll do this I'll do this that's why he had to make an unconditional covenant with Abraham called Abraham broke it he broke his own covenant he gave his wife away twice okay and it came to pass after all that wickedness woe woe unto thee saith the Lord that thou has also built under the in imminent place and has made the a high place in every street in other words they took all the temples that were God's temples and made him what made them into the temples of Moloch and this one and that one in the other one right Baptist Methodist Pentecostal whatever thou has built the high place at every head of the way and have made thy beauty to be abhorred and has opened thy feet to everyone that passed by in other words they were mingling with the other tribes or other Gentiles opening thy feet you know what that means opening thy feet to everyone that passed by and multiplies out horde them they're not gettin better than getting worse now that's also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbors great of flesh and have to increase the hoard of to provoke me to anger Wow I'm like brother Branham if I was God I'd have stopped right there I'd wipe them off the face of the earth now to start it again right wouldn't you but that's not great see that's what I mean you and I can't brother John we can't we're not grace we got to be but we want to give that much grace when I looked at all these people that I gave everything to and they just took everything I have and they made it into idols and they don't even worship God any more than over here worship and all this other stuff behold therefore I have stretched out my hand over there and have diminished our ordinary food and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee what happened remember they were dispersed that seventy weeks of Daniel during that seventy weeks of captivity they were dispersed into every nation where are they now dispersed into every nation but there what the ones that are elect are coming back because the got to come back to the homeland you see how this all fits in with dangling 70 weeks in the seals it all had to fit in together behold therefore I've stretched out my hand into the and have diminished non ordinary food deliver the end of the will that Hateley them to hate them the daughters of the Philistines which are ashamed of my lewd way thou has played the also with the Assyrians he's not finished yet because thou was insatiable in other words unsatisfied okay they were unsatisfied yea thou has played the harlot with them and yet could us not be satisfied they'll have some more over x fornication in the land of Canaan under child ear and yet they'll watch not satisfied with that in other words they keep going and keep going how weak is our hearts the Lord seeing that thou doest all these things to work of an imperious woman that's pretty rough but God said that about Israel in that thou buildest on imminent places in the head of every way and make a stun high place in every street there has been as a harlot and that thou scorn is higher but as a wife that committeth adultery which taketh strangers instead of her husband thy gifts they give gifts to all but thou give us that gifts to all thy lovers and Harris them that they may come unto thee on every side for that whoredom in other words their mixing and mingling and the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms whereas none follow thee to commit whoredom I'm sorry I'm saying all this but this is how bad it is but I'm gonna tell you something about good men in detail give us the reward and no reward is given unto thee now for it there are contrary 4 wherefore o harlot hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God now this is what Jeremiah saying to Israel because the filthiness was poured out and thy nakedness discovered to thy whoredoms without lovers and with all the idols of thy balm abomination there by the blood of thy children which thou didst give unto them behold wherefore I will gather all thy lovers he's not even gonna punish Israel he's gonna punish everybody that had anything to do with Israel behold therefore I will gather all thy lovers with whom thou has taken pleasure and all then that cell has loved with all them thou has hated I will even gather them around about against thee what's going to happen there right now everybody's against Israel Syria and all those other countries would love to see Israel desolate and every Jew killed right well that's what all this comes from that's the same devil that's doing this right here behold I will give all the lovers with him to the house pleasure and all them to their hearts love with all them they'll hate it I'll leave and gather them around about against them we'll discover thy nakedness unto them that they may see all I nakedness and I will judge thee as women that break wedlock now if they break wedlock he's got a divorce ur right and shed blood our judge and I will give thee blood in fury and in jealousy boy there is no way they're gonna make it back would you would you would you come on brother Larry would you I wouldn't give them a chance that's me though but what's this next one I was their 49:14 this is God but science said the Lord has forsaken me and my Lord have forgotten me can a woman forget her second child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yeah they may forget yet will I not forget thee behold I have graven D upon the palms of my hands the walls are continually before me God made that promise now sure you and I are engraved in the palm of his hand but so are they he can't forget how can i how can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yeah they may forget yeah well I not forget they now let's go to Ezekiel back to Ezekiel eight let's go to Ezekiel 18 what's this therefore I will judge you o house of Israel everyone according to his ways saith the Lord God repent and turn yourself from all your transgressions so iniquity shall not be in your room cast away from you all your transgressions whereby you have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will you die o house of Israel for I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies he had no pleasure in putting Israel away Amen but he had to to be just God he had to put Israel away for I have no pleasure in the death of him that died saith the Lord God wherefore turn yourself and live you now let's go to Ezekiel 36 therefore saying to the house of Israel so we're talking to thus saith the Lord God I do not this for your sake o house of Israel but for mine Holy Name state which you have profaned among the heathen whether you win and I will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathen which ye have profound profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord saith the Lord God when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes for I will take you from among the heathen and gather all that tonight this first every one of you were scattered somewhere too you were just like horse Israel please we were we were worshipping other things other demons for I will take you from among the heathen and gather you about out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle hallelujah then will high sprinkle clean water upon you what will we just went through sanctification that clean water that water that came out of that pyramid and sister Shepherds dream was not clear but it was getting clear what was burning all the trash out amen and I will sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness Oh when God says all he means all from all your filthiness and from all it look like and it looked like enough in Ezekiel over there we there was no way that they he'd ever take them back all right he can't take him back his wife but he's not gonna wife in my face of the earth then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness from all your idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you in a new spirit while I put within you now we use that for us but he's going to do that for them too and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in the land that I give to your fathers and you shall be my people and I will be your God boy look what he's bringing them back I will also save you from all your uncleanness and I will call for the corn and will increasing in Lane Oh famine upon you what a promise what a promise all right let's go to Jeremiah again jeremiah 31 we just got a few more to read and we'll be finished jeremiah 31 32 behold the day's come saith the lord then i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah now there's your two separate but he's putting them together not according to the covenant that i made with your fathers why because they broke that one look not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took him by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they break although i was a husband unto them saith the lord but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days but let's not let's not add to the word but the days of the Gentiles after the days of the Gentiles this is what I'm going to do I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts look this v sells you is not getting a lucky' we say well we didn't get in a white robe their souls being clean come on people their soul is being clean that's where the white robe is a white robe you put on a million white robe and you just be this as dirty inside as you ever was but when you get that white robe over that new heart your God little buddy and I will put my law in their inward part and write it in their heart and I will be their God and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord for they shall all know me in the end word man they shall all because you know what I am the priest thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou that's what they were doing they were dependent on that priest to read that sprinkled the blood and do everything for him can y'all not see that's where the Catholic gets their doctrine from they get it from the Old Testament where the priest does everything every year he goes in once you know he goes in every every Sabbath but then he goes in once a year what to clean the whole the whole of Israel remember the makes an atonement the day of atonement he takes one blood in and if for every person is in Israel that's where the Catholics get their priest thing where the Pope can come up and do whatever he wants to for they shall know me we know him amen for the least of them to the greatest of them said Lord for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin that's me and you but that's also leaves real I will remember all that that they done guess what they had a laundry list just like you got one or had one right there's a laundry list I did this I did this I did this I did this Israel do this I did this I did this I will remember that no more because you know what right now God's not accusing you of anything right now Satan is accusing you God said I don't see it hallelujah Jeremiah 50 let's read this one and then we'll be done and I will bring Israel again to his habitation and I shall he shall feed on caramel and Bashan and his soul shall be set now that don't sound like that group I was talking to a minute ago right right and his soul shall be satisfied upon Mount Ephraim and Gilead in those days and then that time says the Lord the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for and there shall be none and the sins of Judah and they shall not be found for I will pardon them whom I reserved amen I will pardon them who I whom I reserved all that they did all that laundry lists you done in all your life if you have been forgiven and that's been putting a sea of God's forgetfulness God can't even remember it he cannot bring it up that's what makes us clean is that God can't remember it and he's all the one that came because you know what that's called grace cuz you and I remember it that ain't called grace but just a point before we close Magicians go ahead and come young Stan but I want to show you one thing around here Daniel 9:24 look let's read this before we stand up helmet let's read this I don't want to hold you to minute too much longer pull that back up Daniel 9:24 cuz that's what we're heading to seventy weeks are determined upon thy people that upon the holy cities to people in the city to finish the transgression number one all that I've been talking about make an end of sin to make reconciliation for iniquity three bringing everlasting righteousness number four seal up the vision and prophecy number five and anoint the most holy number six the six fold purpose restores Israel back to her rightful condition now not not not a wife but back to the promises that God give them that New Covenant there I told my the New Covenant he made with him he's restoring them back now that's the same way with me and you but we have an unconditional covenant he's gonna do it through somebody whether you like it or not but seventy weeks are determined to bring Israel back in next Sunday what we'll do is we'll try to come remember you and I where the wild olive branch let's go come on musicians come on we're this wild this is the olive tree Israel whoever we've been talking about that's the olive tree olive trees always been Israel but remember we'll read it next Sunday they were beat down and a new branch was put in and grafted a wild olive branch was grafted in right here's the grafting because look 70 weeks are determined here's 70 weeks of Daniel there is nothing for room for Gentiles in the 70 weeks of Daniel there's no room what God did God made us room he what he engrafted the Gentiles to take a Gentile bride he literally blinded those Jews so that you and I could come in let's stand to our feet god bless you literally blinded their eyes let me get this out of the way so we see our lovely musicians thank you brother I'll turn that back in a little bit you displayed it in there thank you god bless you I hope you saw something tonight how graceful and merciful God is to a group of people and we hadn't even gotten to that fifth seal because the fifth seal Jew will talk about Lilia later on but but that fish sells you man there enough special group of their own but you know what like I said before you and I aren't a special group for there we're a special group of people we love revelation and we're heading toward a translation that no one else has been heading for so let's before we stop and be before we start Mary brewer brother rain sister Kathy's daughter he's asking we pray especially for the husband of a friend of hers his name is Tony he's had open-heart surgery this week but serious complications may take his life so let's pray right now now you pray like that's you you pray like that's your son or your husband or your whatever you pray serious definitely father Lord this has been brought to our attention that there's a person with a need Lord and it's physical Lord you hung at Calvary to take away those physical pains your blood was shed Lord to give us eternal life but you also stood there as a lamb slain Lord by your stripes we're already healed if either we pray that you'll go to this brother named Tony and that you're restoring Lord just give him a new heart Lord give him Lord strength to be healed and let him know that there's a group of people here in Georgia this praying Lord earnestly that our brother will be raised up and we'll get a good report father it's you that does the healing and you've already done it at Calvary so Lord may you send that anointing to that brother Lord and Lord that we don't know but if for any chance he's not a Christian Lord speak to his soul speak to his soul right now Lord and and let him make things right with you anyway regardless of the situation Lord but this you'll bless him Lord and we'll get a good report bless sister Marion and her husband Lord as they travel we we got that now in our mind they're getting ready to go to Japan and for a couple of years Lord we pray that you would just anoint them may that anointing just travel right over there with them and be with with sister Mary and Mike in the little the little child Lord bring them back safe Lord we'd love to see them again Lord they're part of the family we ask you to bless now though bless his brother Tony wherever he is whatever's going on that you'll just touch his body right now in the name of Jesus Christ amen you know it's not real serious until you till happens to you but brother branham said that woman that little mother entered in it wasn't her baby when her baby but she had a baby that's what I said if you have a son or you have a daughter you have somebody going through complication just bring that Tony into your life whoever that man is and just as he was your own that's what that that's what that sister really did when brother brown said well well that baby was healed by the prayer that mother cuz she entered in that wasn't her child but she had a child and her mind went to God didn't don't let that happen to my child but whatever the devil's done to that child take that away aboard didn't take a profit to pray it took a woman that was compelled to enter into that situation and that's what I'm telling about me and you we can we don't need it you don't need to come up here enter in to that altar of your heart where God's already done the work the works already finished just believe it and
