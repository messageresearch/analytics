========================================

to start talking and then things just lead to other directions and things so we want to be able to have some time to do that amen we go ahead and get started now so um let's just start with a word of prayer first Lord Jesus as we come before you father we just thank you Lord for this opportunity that we have gathered here together Lord with brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith father thank you Lord God for the opportunity to hear your word Lord and father God so many people today are starving Lord God not just for the word but the revelation of your word Lord thank you Father God that we have the Holy Spirit that to guide us Lord and to let us father God receive father God and not just receive but understand father God what you have in in in store for us through your word Lord Lord Jesus we pray that you would forgive us for our sins and if we wrong you in any way shape or form Lord we ask that you'd forgive us Place anything and everything that would hinder this service Lord and and and the rest of uh what we do say and this day Lord Place it under the blood of Jesus Christ Lord we just commit ourselves to you now in this time into your hands we ask you these things in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen all right well it's good to be in in the house of the Lord once again we have some uh some some visitors uh we have Sister Sister Marie she's visiting with us she's already been visiting with us for a few weeks but that was good to have have her here at Sunday school with us and uh so uh and I think her children are here with us her children over there too um and then we also have uh she's not a visitor they're not visitors anymore but we do actually one of them is a visitor Caleb and uh Caleb brother Caleb and Sister Christina sister Grace and sister shakaron they're all from Brother jeene Williams Church in in Anderson South Carolina so it's good to have him here with us it was a surprise when they when they said that they were going to come down so was good to have them here with us amen so we're going to talk this morning if you want to turn to your scriptures or you can look on here uh this morning about Victorious love amen and uh yesterday I was I was just sort of looking through um you know sometimes we sometimes we think well ministers should already just have you know messages just flowing back and forth through their mind constantly well it's not that way come on that's what people think but but it's really not it's really not that way sometimes you have to struggle to to say Lord what it is that you want for you know because what you want is you want what what God wants the people to know amen and what the people are needing to hear at that moment you see it's not really what you want so um and and so I was reading in first John 5 the yesterday morning and I just looking at it and I was thinking you know how important it is amen the love that we have for one another amen and that goes to not just having the love for one another amen because remember the way you love God is the way you're going to love your brother and your sister it's the way you're going to treat your brother and your sister and we're going to see that here in just a moment because remember Jesus said that if you love me you keep my Commandments right but then but then J uh John here takes it one step further and he says if you love The Brethren that means you will keep God's word that means you love God so it all ties in together amen amen and I guess is something you know it's not anything new that we that we're hearing but it's something to just keep in remembrance amen because how important it is the way we treat one another cuz let me tell you it's very easy for us to get down to a point where we get so relaxed with each other that we get to a point where we disrespecting one another right and and that's that's where God does not want to to be because why right that's where Satan starts getting in and then it's a downfall of a church yes so let's just look at this here for just a moment in 1 John chapter 5 says verse one it says whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God Amen and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten in him I want you to see how how how John is talking about if you love the one that begat obviously we know that's God also you will also love those that are begotten of him as well amen so he's he's he's he's talking about a family here amen begot begotten born of God Amen you my you you're my sister you're my brother amen right I'm begotten if if if I have God in Me amen I'm begotten of God if you have God in you you've begotten of God Amen and so we're part of the same part of the same unit amen part of the same family praise God verse Two by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievious and we'll we'll go over here in just a moment what that that word Grievious means for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world Amen and this this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith faith and love they're tied to each other amen who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God now I don't I don't understand why maybe somebody can help me but I don't know why why there's a question mark there but uh because to me that sounds like a statement but I always wondered about that why there's a question mark there and every script every Bible I've looked that there's a question mark there so maybe somebody might know why why that why that's there could explain it to me amen now so let's we're just going to go through it at it you know just verse by verse amen let's look at verse one for whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God Amen yes that's simple amen we can look at we can look at at at John chapter 1 where it says but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God Amen we have power Amen to we've always been Sons and Daughters of God right but Power there's power in recognizing who you are that's right amen right there's power in knowing that you are a child of God yes and then you're not here to just be here right amen you're here to fulfill his purpose you're healed to fulfill a higher calling than than just you amen and and and so there's there's power in that amen power to become the sons of God I mean in this in this hour amen it's such a privilege to know that we are children of God Amen to know that we have a heavenly father that we are LED and guided LED and and guided by amen through his holy spirit even to them that believe on his name in verse 13 it says which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God so so you come into this thing amen it wasn't by your own doing right you didn't want to you didn't want to serve God trust me you didn't want to serve God if you would be honest with you that's that's not what we wanted to do sure we wanted to live out in the world and live like the devil we didn't think we were living like the devil but that's what we wanted to do cuz that's what our flesh naturally wants to do wants to do the things of the world and and and to live like the world Amen you want to keep up with the Fashions of the world you want to keep up with the music of the world the trends of the world the things of the world Amen so it's it it's good to know I like the scripture because it lets us know that Lord It's you doing the work in my life that's right it's not me doing the work amen not of blood nor of the will of the flesh not of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God Amen so so we see there in 1 John CH 5 amen that and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him so if you love God you're going to love your brother amen if you love God you're going to love your sister amen amen and and I believe it was Jesus that said one time he said that you you you would so much love your brother and your sister that you would lay your life down for them now a lot of people a lot of us think that maybe maybe that's talking about that you're in a situation where they got a gun draw up to their up to their head and and you get in between them and get take the bullet but really that's one thing all right yeah but really the sacrifice that you're taking yes to pray for your brother and your sister when you don't feel like it that's right to forgive your brother and your sister when you don't feel like forgiving them but they wrong you that's right Amen to do something good when that person get on gets on your nerves physically to do something good for them that's right are you willing to lay your life down for their benefit that's right in those areas of our life you see what I'm saying yes not just taking the bullet for them which is good and that's courageous and that's that's that's Hollywood like you know but to but to lay down your life in our everyday dealings with our brothers and your sisters does that make sense yes amen so that's very important important amen that we we think about these things because why brother Dale says amen you want to see God look around you that's right if it's God in you then it's God in Me we should treat one another in a certain in a certain fashion amen there's a certain way that brother that brothers and sisters treat each other amen and in John 8:42 still on on verse one it says Jesus said unto them if God were your father and he was talking to the Pharisees here if God were your father you would love me amen see since God is our father we love him right and and and and not just loving him and and when we look at this here when you look at that word love in every single scripture that I'm telling you right right now even in John first John when you look at the back at the Greek on that word it always goes back to agape love every single time now later on get some time we'll show you a scripture where it actually uses the word ailio and it's the love of the world that's ailio love right but it's not the love of God Amen so if you love me what is loving God well we know God is his word amen loving the word and wanting to to want wanting more of that word amen abiding in him and and staying in that word amen that that that's loving God Amen you want more of him amen because then eventually that word will manifest through your life amen that's right the more the more you feed on it the more it will come come out of you amen the more you feed on the things of the uh uh uh on the physical food of Life eventually might start showing up on you it will eventually show right right same thing with the with the spiritual food amen eventually it's going to show yes if you're feeding on the right things and the holy things of God Amen so and continue here if you if uh if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me amen now brother brand says here in in marriage and divorce he says and that's the way it is with God if I if a filial love which is human love Fellowship love can make a man feel that about his wife what about agape love the Greek word meaning the love of God how would that make me do about Jesus Christ all right that's how we should should love him in that love that he loves us and obviously he is love right and if the holy spirit is dwelling in you then what's got to project out of your life his love that's right not your love amen amen so the what love that he loves you with if the holy spirit is dwelling in you that's the love that project out that's right amen and that loves him back with amen amen and how would that make me do about Jesus Christ I as as long as I want to go do it it's in my heart to do it whether I say as long as it's in my heart to do it I go do it legalism won't let me do it it's because that I know I'd get punished for doing it but the real truth of it is is when the love of God comes into your heart till you want to do it yes amen not anybody pulling or pushing amen but it's because you want to to do it why cuz the love of God Amen is so much in you um do you want to do that's the truth of it there is the two schools not legalism or other amen or Calvinism it's both all right let's go down verse two praise the Lord should I move over here a little bit north the I don't know if that was capturing me or not you're almost in the frame all right verse two does anybody have any questions or any comments to this point this is Sunday school so praise the Lord amen thank you verse two it says by this we know that we love the children of God now this is an Evidence here by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments there it it is remember what Jesus was Jesus said in John 14:15 if you love me keep my Commandments now that's just not the Ten Commandments that's right right but that's his word right in other if you can read that if you love me keep my word right amen that's the book from Genesis to Revelation that's right not just Ten Commandments because the Catholics they try to keep the Ten Commandments I know cuz I used to be a Catholic and we swear by those Ten Commandments and we would try to live by those Ten Commandments and we could couldn't even keep those Ten Commandments much less we could keep the rest of the Commandment right because why we are seeking uh a Catholic is seeking uh uh uh forgiveness and and and has to constantly uh ask forgiveness to the priest and confess and all these different things they have their hopes and and some and something else but amen the child of God has his hopes in Christ that's right has you laid your burdens down and you put your things on those things on Christ if you love me keep my Commandments that was one point that at one time that was that was fine when Jesus was saying that but then John as I said he goes takes it further by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments yes they all go hand in hand right you keep his Commandments you love God right you love God you love the Brethren amen and you will not do anything to the Brethren or to the sister sister that you would do if you knew that that was God standing amongst us would you gossip about your sister would you gossip about your brother if you knew that that was the actual Lord Jesus Christ standing there you would not oh but let me let me let me just like a like a lot of us I want you to pray for such and such why what was going on but let me tell you now when when somebody comes up to me and starts saying that you can you can as my wife and I'm not saying that I'm holier than that or nothing like that that's one thing that I've always despised is Gossip oh yeah I hate gossip I hate it with a passion and and and I I can see it from a mile away because it's something that that that it hurts it hurts your spirit when you know that you got involved in it that's right and if you know something about your brother and and the best thing that you can do is f first of all you pray for your brother pray for your sister yes and if you need to talk to some something somebody about it talk to your pastor all right but you don't have to spread around the church you don't have to because why amen that's what the scripture says love covers a multitude of sins amen amen pray for your brother pray for your sister and and let your pastor know you know because and then he let him decide what he wants to do amen praise God but uh we use that excuse sometimes and sometimes people come with us that excuse pray for such such person and it's it's opportunity for them to open up the gossip you know well you know what they did you know what they said at that moment what you should do is say well how was your fishing trip brother last week what it was fine good good how many fish did you catch it completely just tears tears that Spirit right there and there yes amen praise God in John 15 10 and we'll read a quote here just a moment if you keep my Commandments ye shall abide in my love Jesus said even as I have kept my father's Commandments and I abide in his love amen so this thing is about abiding I remember last time when I when I did Sunday school we talked about abiding in Christ amen this is part of abiding in him and him abiding in US amen again remember this love that we're talking about here in every scripture when you click on the Greek on the Greek Lexicon it's always agape love all right it's the love of God this whole thing is about the love of God but Bram says in love you let your wife know that you love her do you Brothers I know I can do it more but she knows that I love her but we should always that they they want to know that amen it's a reiteration they want to know that she loves you it'll when you're when you're a young couple and find favor with one another it makes you join yourselves together for a lifetime Journey love and that's a filial love that's human love what will a Godly love do when you can really get into a place that you can show God that you love him and you got confidence in him so it's like all right me me and Christine Christine and me we we decided to get married and we I love her but yet I I'm constantly at work and I'm calling her what are you doing at the grocery store what are you buying now well how much are you charging on the in are are you are you changing Zoe's diaper what if I was constantly doing that to her right that would mean that I am not showing any sort of confidence in her and that is not that's not showing her true love and so love amen love and confidence goes hand in hand because why when you have when you love God you've given your life over to him completely and you say Lord I have confidence in you I have confidence totally in your word everything that it says whether I understand it or not I completely confide in your word because why I know that you cannot lie amen that's that's that's that's a aspect of love amen agapy love how you'll join yourself to him not only for a life's journey but for eternity how you're willing to take his word just at what he says and say that's right Lord I question it not and you move right on amen that's that's what takes real love praise God first John 5:3 says how much time we got 15 15 15 minutes okay verse three says for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous or great g g Grievous now that word Grievous amen it means not weighty grave or burdensome or heavy in other words to a true child of God obeying his word and staying with his word is not something that's burdensome to him or her right that's right it's not a burden amen for you to come to church it's not a burden for you to pray it's not a burden for you to have to come to your brother to shake his or sister to shake his or her hand why because why that's reflecting the love amen of God in you amen it's not a burden amen uh uh uh to obey God's word amen why because God's love is is is is is in you amen it's reflecting out amen it's it's it's it's it's showing forth amen it's all in you and then it wants to come out of you amen so that others can benefit from it that's right I think I I said last time you know God gives us gifts M and it's just like a tree right a tree Bears forth fruit and God has given each and every one of us some sort of gift sister Trudy every time I I I I I go I I go I go you know she's around me she's she's very very kind I mean she's very very kind sister that's right she is you know and a lot of you all are that way you know and and and there's a certain gift that you all have that draws people to you you know and so when you have the when you God has given us these gifts and it's like a tree an apple tree those apples that are coming forth from that tree they're not for the tree to enjoy right they're for us to enjoy right and those gifts that you and I possess amen they're not for our own benefit but they're for the benefit of other people yes right the gift that brother brandham had it wasn't for him it was for for the people to to benefit that gift amen and so therefore we have to we have to be careful how we use those gifts how we how we how we manifest those gifts amen because remember it's God Amen that it's it's not your gift it's God's Gift amen so obeying God's word is not it's not and keeping his word is not Grievous it's not it's not weighty it's not burdensome and Jesus uh mentioned this in in Matthew 11 says come unto me all ye that labor in our heavy lat and I will give you rest there's no better rest than in Christ amen take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls listen for my yoke is easy and my burden is light in other words my word is easy and my word is light the Christian Life is only as hard as you make it right amen you're the one who decid how difficult the Christian Life is because it really is isn't all he wants us to to the only burden that he wants us to have is his word and and and and and if you're in love with God it's not a burden to have his word amen on you you know you know to have anything that has to do with his word that shouldn't be a burden right no a lot of people make the Christian Life oh it's a it's tough it's difficult it's a bunch of rules but it really isn't because Jesus expressed it right here he said for my yoke is easy and my burden is life oh yeah so just put every other burden put it on him just take his word that's the only burden he wants us to have and really it's not a burden once you're once you're in love with Christ that's right am amen amen praise God now I want just I want us to read this here in John I know it's lengthy reading but uh I want us to read here because I like what Jesus said here in John 15 he says here and is my father glorify that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples and the father hath loved me so have I loved you continue ye in my love so he tells us continue ye in my Commandments but he also says continue ye in my love which remember the love keeping his word it's all it's all in all all it's it's whole it's the same thing amen if you keep my Commandments ye shall abide in my love right amen even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that you this is not anybody else's commandment this is my commandment this is Jesus speaking that you love one another as I have loved you so let's look and see how Jesus loved his disciples how he loved the people how he loved and let's love in that same way amen greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends jumping taking the bullet for your brother amen ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you these things I command you that you love one another it's a commandment amen if the world hate you you know that I It hated me before it hated you that's why he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities because he went through it first amen if he were of the world the world would love his own now that's the word love right there uh when you look when you look at the that word love right there that's the filal love right there look look at the definition of that love there and that goes back to filio see the the world only loves you for what you have that's right the world only loves you for what you can for what they can get out of you or what you you can give them amen but it has nothing to do with God agape love love his own but because you are not of the world but I have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you so you know when I came in when I came to Christ there was a lot of things I had a lot of worldly friends and I I do a lot of you know things with them and it came a point in time when when I came to Christ and my life started changing and and things started taking place and I didn't have to do one thing to get them to stop hanging out with me they just automatically started going away there's not one thing that I had to do I didn't have to tell them don't call me anymore don't do anything to why cuz they saw that you were not going with their program anymore and they started automa we we can't get nothing out of this guy anymore so that's what the world's going to do amen that's a sign that God's doing a work in your life amen first John ver 5 verse4 oh my for whatsoever is born of God I feel like brother Bob here now for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world Amen you are Overcomers why because he's already overcame for you amen and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith 1 John 4:4 tells us you are of God little children and have over and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen aren't you glad that you're an overcomer this morning amen why because you have the Overcomer in you amen these things I have spoken unto you in John 16:33 that ye that in me you might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world I love that scripture amen be of good cheer because Jesus has already over and Jesus said this before he died on the cross yes amen that mean he he knew he he's already Overcomer amen amen yeah but 1 Corinthians 15:57 but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ amen so it's it it it's our faith how are we going to overcome amen through faith amen faith is a victory for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world period I mean and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen again going back to what John said for Ephesians 6:16 above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked amen Lord again to have that Faith amen yes and to know that we are Overcomers how about God brother Brown says and you're scared to swallow some of the gospels that he gives you by his stripes you are healed faith is the victory that overcomes the world swallow it and see what happens it's a confidence amen going back to that confidence right you show what confidence you have in your doctor by taking his medicine that you don't know what it is right right you show your confidence in the doctor by submitting yourself to an operation that proves your confidence in the doctor but when it comes to Christ you're scared to take him at his word again if you love him amen you're you will have confidence in his word how is it faith is the victory you could submit your case to Jesus Christ tonight just as you submit your case to the doctor give me anything you want to Lord You're the doctor on the case then you've got V the victory then you've got faith that overcomes you'll never hunt another prayer line You'll never hunt nothing else you'll never you'll have it right there it'll be all settled you'll never jump from church to church to see if this one's got it or that one's got it they haven't got it you've got it then when you've got the faith you have the victory amen amen praise God I'll just skip some of this cuz we're sort of running out of time now so in 1 John 5:5 says who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God and first John 4:15 tells us whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in him and he in God again John finishes here with verse 5 going back to verse one and telling us who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God um praise God I think this is the last slide let me I going to read this last quote before we leave and I know that you all have seen this SW you might not be able to read it says love one another brother R said this in 1963 Chris the myy of God reveal Christ is the my love one another above everything love one another don't no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet Groot but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his Target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever and and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it man don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved too or that woman orever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another and stay with your pastor see he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through and cause and cause he's ordained of God to do so that's right now now do you remember that the enemy will come and when he does that the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all amen don't never Clan among one or talk and make yourself clannish all right we are one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away cuz you're not a right hand all right wouldn't there do that that's right and uh I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another amen why cuz the love of God is going to project that amen so that's that's Victory amen Victorious love praise God appreciate you all than
