verse 9 but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry ground all right let's go to John to Romans 2 I wish you would read the entire chapter we won't this read with just part of it but read the entire second chapter especially and watch what we when we get into the message of what I'm talking about and you'll see that we very valuable to follow in that line let's just go to verse 10 and then we'll pick up about five verses and go from there but glory honor and peace to every man that work is good to the Jew first and also to the Gentile so that's everybody okay everybody for there is no respect of persons with God for as many as I've sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearers of the law are just before God but the doers of the law shall be justified for when the Gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law once are law unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another he goes on to talk about in the day other judgments in the thing you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now I want to try to finish the part that we're talking about salvation I'm not finishing the salvation where I'm from about the basis of what we've trying to to think about things and then try to move in to some thoughts that would be and now we will continue on because really what we'll do in a lot of respects we'll pick up a lot of types and shadows you know from the Old Testament to see about the New Testament remember the one thing that we've been talking about now remember salvation can't be one way in the Old Testament and another way in the new the Old Testament was by faith and grace and thing the new testament of the same thing the only difference is one of them is the promise now keep emphasizing that the Old Testament all you see in the old doesn't is a promise looking forward going forward going forward all right the New Testament settled into the product that the Old Testament was promising all right now so write that down and think on it see that what we're going to be doing is thinking of how the Old Testament will bring that promise into light that you can see it but it's not a full reality to be a finished product all right and that's why that it had to be the way it would be then Jesus Christ would have to come and die to bring the product in the view of the New Testament of salvation but remember whether it's old our new you can't make your salvation in one place one thing something they could do or didn't do or whatever it is and then make it over here some kind of a grace and make it unconditional because that's what we're going to strike home when we finally get to it about an unconditional covenant all right now what's this is the thought what do you think of as an unconditional covenant well it's the covenant with no conditions that's man's mentality is we'll get to a word in a minute or brother profit is bringing compassion in what he's describing in his being he brings one side of it as the world and the thoughts he brings the other side of it as what God thinks of alright so then that's the way we're gonna have to do with the unconditional covenant you mean you can go out live like the devil and Beyond under under an unconditional covenant there's more conditions to the to an unconditional covenant that sounds crazy don't there's more conditions to be met under the New Testament then all the Old Testament put together you know and realize that basically you live a decent life according to the law right I mean you're talking is with all of us see because you don't do this you do that you know you don't yeah we don't still when allowing us heat we don't then you say oh no you don't understand unconditional that's what you don't understand you're banking it one way God's making it another way you ain't whether you can live like the devil and get by with it yeah no way okay we'll get to that eventually all right now remember what we've been talking about salvation the word deliverance the salvation to the Old Testament and what it would be based upon is the Word of God right the Bible all right the Word of God in other words if you don't follow that line up you're not according to taking of the word alright then we talked about it being based upon the blood remember then all the Old Testament no further of the blood would be in the New Testament under the reality of Jesus Christ that was once offered all right now we see salvation was and will always be based upon the same thing you can't change it then we're gonna get down to something maybe the Lord will in the life of the message if we have time we will get down to something the real touchy and I'll tell you that what I've been doing and you can believe this or not it's alright with me I've been studying on this thought for over 40 years I've tried to preach it I've tried to express it I tried to bring it out into wording and I wonder has it accomplished I see 40 years thinking on something studying on something pondering on a thought you ought to know then if it's been that much and I admit it then you were to know for certain that I didn't have the answer what if I had if I'd had the answer I wouldn't been studied only 40 years I'm not a been studied on how but it turns out to be but I certainly wouldn't have been thinking on it all right now so the Lord is clearly opening up the word to express it and I knew this when I was told you that I would speak on salvation No I knew that and I knew we'd have to come to this so if we get a little lengthy tonight forgive me I'll try not to but I'll just do the best that I can do you know the only difference in the Old Testament and the New Testament the Old Testament was a promise right what else could you use wording there and the other one is the product of that now salvation in the Old Testament was a deliverance right okay it brought in the tone that came because of that to apply to the individual all right so then what would be the difference in the older in the New Testament in that basis see it would bring it to show you that we're missing what they had where do you think those people are today that has died and went on you don't never think what I think about what it really hurts me you know what brother Adam said one day he said you and I will be held responsible for not carrying the gospel to the heathen I'm not just not that that's why we send as much money as we can we do the best we can to try to help to do a lot of things all right now so now the difference would only be in the basics of what you have the Old Testament it was so wonderful what it had now remember the point that I brought out the Old Testament salvation was the deliverance to mankind whether it being used for the children of Israel coming out or whether it being used for salvation of the soul of an individual or the life of an individual all right and in that then we can look back and see it and it's the perfect example of where we are see that's why people don't understand brother Branham you don't listen what he say it and inconsiderate you know that red around said the ten commandments was the seals well feels over here or what it is he said before the commandments came to seals come down he said the Old Testament the seals I mean the commandments was God in letter form well we make it's a book of rules now follow that talent as we go along we know salvation is based upon God's Word and what is said it's based upon the blood that would speak back dire and the blood would be offered and transmitted everything forward to what it would come to the blood of Jesus Christ that would pay the price for the old and the new and bringing it into reality all right now we know that it was based upon the blood they were shed back down he took blood Fernet own it would have to be blood over here the only difference you and how the blood of an animal the blood of Almighty God when it's the promise the other one is the product so write that down promise Oh Jasmine product new because he they had a promise they remember also what we talked about that salvation must produce you a place to go to when you die is that not the purpose of salvation I mean is it not a purpose in the fact of thinking of salvation that there has to be some form of happy hunting ground or you know or whatever so then it's based upon that point and we know for a certain that the soul of that individual in the Old Testament by his faith in believing God provided him a place to work when he passed away there his soul would go we know in the New Testament by faith in Almighty God and in the atonement in the things in the blood of Jesus Christ that our faith by believing brings forth the product and places a person into a place that the Prophet went there and saw souls under the altar and how beautiful it was it truly provided a place but the old testament provided it okay now you maybe get surprised at a while when we get down into this Old Testament all right now I'm going to make the statement and then it'll take me a while maybe Sunday or a munde another week or two or a month or two to get to the main point but you know salvation is based not upon a God of sympathy now you're gonna listen you're gonna hold on a minute with me so listen now salvation is not based upon a god of sympathy cuz of it words why didn't he save everybody come on why didn't he say their play well see when he went in if they believe now that in a year you see you're jumping around on me stay with me and listen LeBron said there's a lot of difference between compassion and sympathy the title of the message tonight is number four on salvation but it's called a compassionate God we read in the scripture there about the compassion then we know for a certainty before we get dark I'll give you these thoughts then we'll back up sympathy is to you know to put up with something or you know think about somebody or something you know and and different things happen under sympathy but compassion now compassion is interchangeable so go look it up and all but we got to listen to the Prophet now we get what he says I don't care what Webster has to say about it because the word compassion is the same word of sympathy even in the Strong's Concordance as a matter of fact the Old Testament form of compassion is a better word than the New Testament form because in the New Testament form is just like compassion is like we know I'm sorry for them and I'll go down now brother Adam said he said God didn't say you know my brother told you he come up one day and said that to me he said God just said well and people down there won't listen to it so I'll they send my son remember he's turning to Terry said I'll just send my son down and he'll die and they'll believe it then the run said that ain't right compassion is to do the will in his will is this word compassion is to follow the world to follow it to the letter and walk out upon that very word so he's a compassionate God he's not a God of sympathy don't try to appease him in any way you don't do that with God you simply say I'm sorry don't try to appease Emer or play around without Lord you know me you know have a little compassion on me Lord he says I am I'm giving you the will of God for your life now you take the will of God and we can call it salvation you take sympathy and no salvation and sympathy yeah but God is a sympathizing God no gods a compassionate God we'll get to that later in the talk all right so now it's based upon whether God is a compassionate God or he is a God of sympathy all right now here was where we ended up on the message you know a couple of weeks ago nice winds here when it was couple weeks ago we were talking about grace being the oldest religion that there is and how it came to Pais and I brought forth the things and how that grace was before the sin yeah no brother that sets up here his brother was with us other day in here he come out and he said Joe I thought well I wonder how many yet in the church we listen to that he said sir he said I enjoyed your message as well thank you he said you know I never thought of the fact that the Savior came before the sin they say he got that out of the message that I tried to preach that the Savior came first and then the sin came later did you catch that did you understand it that way then you wouldn't follow them if you don't because what happened in the garden seen it in the picture God stepped out of heaven cleaned down to earth and made the atonement for their sins so that they could be counted as being saved by grace through faith that he had already done that in his mine before the world ever begun is it right he had already paid the price so grace supplied the atonement it wouldn't have told me coming in in grace coming no grace came first then it supplied the atonement that way that would make God in the right order okay so then we were saved by grace through faith and don't matter where there's Old Testament or new you're saved by grace through faith so now that would make it right or what we were trying to bring out the one of the conditions of salvation would it be old or new it's whether or not you can believe that is for you come on and you never thought about why did it says it abraham believed god and what does it say and it was imputed or counted or reckoned unto him in salvation right so then salvation is based solely upon faith your faith that you can believe that it's for you now it doesn't matter where it's older new yeah but it's fun all right we'll get that in a minute let me ask you a question before we get to that thought and you never wondered why God put Adam and Eve on a conditional covenant I didn't say that you read your prophets message your tile yorda studied it enough to know he said it why would they put on the conditional covenant those are drastic immoral I mean a wonderful purpose we'll get to it in a minute to listen the atonement is what keeps you saved now you listening the atonement older noona is what keeps you saved why did Brett around say he says your kept saved by what by the blood had all this and that all that Gudrun said you're kept saved he said you're not saved by the blood he said you were saved by grace through faith but he said you're cut saved by the blood I'm saved I thought it's unconditional I thought it was an unconditional that's when we get in their mind at all we don't realize it it comes down from organized religions right on down into the message and then we settled in to that point and it don't matter what it's saying I believe it this way okay that's with me because ain't gonna change you know alright now what are we doing it on hold it right it's based upon the word and what it says it's based upon the blood would it be older new it's based upon faith in the blood it's based upon whether God is a compassionate God or a God of sympathy boyer does he see we make it say what we want it to say all right grace was given to Adam and Eve in the garden grace was older than their sin because he knew what they would do it was already for part all he done was stepped out and I tell you want I don't know how many of you been listening but about three months ago I said we're gonna get down to earth one of these days we stayed before the foundation in the world for about three months and I said one of these days we're gonna get down to earth well you know what we just now got tire you know what the other day when I screamed that out I said grace step from glory to earth brought us right down to earth and where we are to the human race grace is a person Grace restore took the mantle rip them apart and brother Brandon said don't the skins into behind the bushes they had him and even told him to put them on then you know what he said just doing notes he he said there's in the bushes having church that's what your prophet said see he still thought she's right all right but now get to the point brother branham makes an outstanding statement and i emphasize a little bit upon him he says in the message of message of grace 61 the grace was shown first it's also in the message paragraph 82/63 he calls what happened in Genesis the Word of God he calls it the law you remember that last week we're going last they were in a priestly you remember me talking about that did it he says it's the law well see we think Ten Commandments is the law Ten Commandments was added 3,000 years almost later from the beginning in Genesis he's not talking about the Ten Commandments back there that's what I tried to emphasize to get you to see what was the 10 what was the Commandments to Adam and Eve don't steal don't drank don't cheat don't run around with women don't smoke don't do well they've never done any of that what was the law that he's talking about the loss on that is the Word of God the Word of God told Adam and Eve do not pur take of that tree of knowledge that was all they had to do or not do you hear brethren say Adam and Eve had one word and couldn't keep it so we got the whole Bible see they never had a book of rules that's why when you get to it the laws not a book Ruth it's a revelation of Jesus Christ you know my love I've heard it as rules and regulations that's what you've heard all your life does that make it right see then that was a life point we were talking about little random called what he gave to them in the garden the law which was his word that said do not partake of that tree of knowledge that was the only thing they had to do or don't do right he didn't sit down and tell us that now no you don't steal you don't cheat you don't lie you don't do you know I said just don't protect well when you come to the natural law you were to realize if God gave that back there started to doubt away where did he come into the Ten Commandments we see that's where people don't believe it that way they take the Ten Commandments is law you ain't never been in a Baptist Church they never heard people in the Baptist Church were in your church where you come from we ain't under law weeds under grace Jesus Christ was was under grace did he done away with that law my Bible said he magnified the law my Bible said he made it honorable it said that he enhanced it in other words that's what the Bible says I knew then scriptures when I was in a bad this church then I didn't agree with that salt the Ewing the Word of God is just a a book of rules I thought this entire Bible was a revelation in Jesus Christ and my quoting brother Branham he said if you can't see what Christ in every verse you should go back to read again he's because he missed it thou shalt not kill I like the way brother Gary Atkins was about it he said the way we take it is you know God looks over he said thou shalt not kill I feel not still I shall not lie Ameen God you know and he said but why don't we read it the way God said God said that's your lunch deal a compassionate God says thou shalt not steal thou shalt not kill it changes the whole story you've heard the man that his wife kept writing him a letter sent earn it and he got this other guy to read the letter every guy was reading that letter to him and read it with you I said here she made reminding he's penned it to her he said well when she changed her mind off yes straight well he got another guy to read it yeah got rid of said honey I need some money could you see he said she changed her mind I'll send it to her now that's about the way we are in the Word of God only a whole lot worse all right grace came to earth to take the skins off did he already had him covered never asked the question I said what kept Adam and Eve from being killed from the time they sinned until God made the atonement when one second of rent in the presence of God he would have killed Adam and Eve Grace had already made way cause grace before the world the morning stars sang together sons of God shouted for Jonah yeah that was in God's mind now we're getting from God's mind into a reality that we step to earth and in the Garden of Eden and God they understand what they're doing you know what brother Adam said the tree of life was in the garden to remind Adam and Eve that her youth was being renewed you know what he's talking about you know their flesh was what was needed to being renewed not her soul because it was eternal according to blaspheme it's nothing now I didn't write the book grounds when it said he breathed into his nostrils eternal life see we don't believe that especially saying in to eat I don't believe in hat now I believe it could be maybe for Adam but I don't think it could be for Eve see why not she was part of him we're not brought around when brother Brennan said they were in theophany together as one but we don't believe it but now listen all they had to do was not protect of the Tree of Life I mean it's really knowledge that's all I had to do you know what that eternal life in their soul their spirit wasn't eternal but there was nothing out of you know Satan had not got into that road he began to get into it along about sin problem but their body is what needed the real atonement like that they started off a wonderful situation don't you realize that today Adam and Eve died know that they went to paradise which was the Old Testament moves him of Abraham it was called a place for the soul to go when they died you realize they had eternal life well we don't we can't fathom that and see you said this way present Ella I don't know you bring out these sign I just can't believe it can't believe what would you mind telling me what you can't believe about the statement that brother Brennan said Adam had eternal life in his soul it was his body that didn't have it and his spirit was the problem is there something wrong with expressing that something wrong with our head all right but now remember this thought as we try to pick up now Adam and Eve in the garden according to the message God's only provided place of worship we'll jump over to number 4 brothers you can pull that out while I'm getting to a point and you'll see that brother Branham says there was also two covenants given one covenant was given to Adam which was on condition like law if we will not touch this you know live but if you touch it you'll die no the other law was given or another then another covenant was given to Abraham all right that's coming away on over right so let's just stick with Adam and Eve Adams covenant was unconditional Adam and Eve's Covenant was conditional well why would God started off on condition what what would I start off on condition could you see that was the only way he could do it now listen for a second and he given Adam and Eve listen had he given Adam and Eve an unconditional covenant handed to them he could have never condemned them for being wrong they wouldn't have been wrong because it would unconditional because that's the way you're thinking of unconditional are you listening have you given Adam and Eve an unconditional covenant then how could he condemn them now let's take another word I've told you that the people of this message don't believe in it they don't believe in free moral agency you get out and find out ask questions you'll find out they don't believe in free moral agency they believe the bride is a special group that was brought all the way from glory down and placed over here and there's no nothing to them all the rest of the world is under free moral agency well we gave a whole message on free moral agency where I could say you ought to believe the Prophet that talked about free moral agency right if not go back a few weeks and get the title you hear it the only way God could bring man to the position that he could fall was to give him free moral agency do you agree that's exactly what he done he gave them a choice they could have stayed away from that tree and they would have had no trouble that's quoting her or starting to want to go Lauren said that Adams youth was being renewed while he was are in the garden by free moral agency God knowing if he made him with an unconditional covenant he could not condemn him but he knew he might have with condition I didn't say it's your prophet saying come on let's see what is it another one yeah go ahead to number five this own condition he had a covenant with Adam the first man on earth and that covenant was on conditions if you do so-and-so I'll do so-and-so Adam would have something to do in order to keep this covenant alive before God okay he had to walk in God's Way keeping all of his word not breaking the word that's what Adam had to do if he'd had done that everything would have stayed the way it was right because there was a condition out there don't touch of that tree but if you do you're gonna prove you're not believing me well why did he even go to that tree she was a free moral agent which meant she made her own choice so when he gave man his choice he knew what the choice would be right he knew he would fall for the devil's lie too had to put him on a condition or they wouldn't have been a fall I need to repeat that about 10 times maybe put them on an unconditional covenant the way we think about unconditioned as being no conditions how could you have condemned her for what you've done my free moral agency he gave them a choice that choice would be a condition that's exactly what's your profit and that's not the only two he said God put Adam and Eve on a conditional covenant no one by doing what he would do that they would sin but knowing he already had the atonement ready I put it this way before the Eve ever started her act grace was on its way right grace was on its way out of glory before Eve ever done what she done because he knew exactly what he was gonna go but are you listening I'm trying to give you something where you can think and you never considered what was the condition Adam was put on when your prophet is one it said it the Bible don't say it you know what I mean you can't find anybody what Adam would put on conditional coda you can't find over an Abraham we put on unconditional cousin cuz it's not written that way what are you listening man was given a choice the god of glory knowing the choice he would make now don't be too hard on me but y'all need to quit no word okay wait said he gets the Sunday ones would just think think about what I'm saying Adam and Eve was placed on the conditional covenant so they would fall did god megamen oh he made them with a free moral agency choice right he didn't make him do it now come on he gave them the choice and they done it and when he did he had to come to that and condemn it there's nothing to condemn under an unconditional covenant we'll get to that later but it's condemned by felt I read in the scripture to you that we'll be reading over and over for a while that I'm sure something that I've studied on 40 almost 50 years when I first heard that prophet and the way he began to say thank God if we could never understand that we could never understand what he say it it'll sure help us would listen free moral agency is a right to choose grace came before the atonement right it existed before the atonement but didn't need to be applied until the sin then grave provided the atonement same thing with Jesus cry me come on we're still a free moral agency no o your own free moral agency to accept the word and reject the word same thing all right see once sin entered the picture grace produced the product of the atonement God stepped from heaven to earth in the person of grace to take the skin from the animals and place it on Adam and Eve and make an atonement make an atonement so truly if we are then saved by grace see here's something I wrote a long time ago so you just think about it as we get to later that we will be considering the point of what is an unconditional covenant can we live like the devil and still say it's unconditional now write this down your very conscience won't allow you to do that come on but just remember be careful and got them here in the scripture you can sear your conscience yeah okay now think with me for a second to where we can get to point soin Adam and Eve sinned where did they see in you remember we went back under where did this in it they didn't sin in their soul because that soul was eternal bless me miss nice what their body would not be capable of sin because he cannot sin so where would the sin enter the picture in the garden into her five senses of the second rim now I say that because you know there's a difference in the way the Prophet told it here and told it here when it all comes out to be the same way so I use it the way I mean for it to be you the second rim which the first room is CJ's filled smelling here second room is memory reason conscience affections the third room is only one sense that's either faith or doubt all right so God so the devil attack Eve in her conscious her spirit realm now watch that in a minute so you better stay awake like a angel you're gonna need it see they already had eternal life in their soul so the only place Satan could attack was the second realm of mankind the memory reason conscious affections he couldn't attack nothing else he could not get that soul to sin he couldn't do that he had to go into the point to her there's this realm that we call and try to hold to it be into what the spirit realm of mankind goes bringing all the prophets is of the things we come down to see you have five senses or outer five senses per second one sense for the sinner and you call it spirit or soul or whatever you want to just remember you're dealing with that second dream all right because they could not sin in their soul so Satan could not work on Eve so now father it you remember we brought it out that's why Paul said he wasn't scared that Satan through his subtilty would deceive he's talking to the church right would deceive the church Oh bless God I can't be deceived honey you already are you need to be trying to get rid of it I don't like your attitude I don't either but is it the truth okay forget it alright where do you see in over brother Dale I don't see in the Bible and the Prophet says that only a Christian can sin a sinner is condemned on a higher level well I'll tell you what that's joining us Baptist doctor I'll agree with hear the word is it that you sin by disbelieving God's Word in the spirit realm our second room which is your memory reasonable conscience affection sometimes and there's work troubles because in that room is where we try to analyze everything we try to figure it all out that Center realm you ever heard the Prophet say he said if that Center in speech he said all else shut up why because that Center realm knows what's doing but Satan is trying to attack to us he can't attacked in our soul if you're born again now do you agree with that now let's back up now to see if you agree with this ball no we got to go here than everybody you wait after Adam and Eve they were the only two that had eternal life in their soul Old Testament people there's only two it had it right okay if that be true then Cain Abel came with not an eternal soul they became with the body spirit and soul into Satan's domain we don't get down in some little tiki-tiki things in a minute so listen so once it came to Cain and Abel even there all the way down except for Jesus Christ all mankind is born to the basis the body the spirit the soul or whatever you wanna call it first room second room third room is totally black and lost over brother Dale I believe I got this seat in here well now my Bible says you do what you want to my Bible says God won't dwelling unclean vessels so now you do what you won't do it you put all this seed here and see there we know what for profit is covered but you see that's were that people aren't gonna listen to the real truth okay now listen so ever man everybody since then now are you listening get the board's right Adam and Eve had a soul it was eternal a spirit second room that was not eternal and a body that were not eternal okay but everybody acted in had no eternal life in the soul so now listen to what I'm saying now Satan attacks every individual every individual in their soul in their spirit because he's got access to it now here's where we're gonna get it we're gonna prove a point after a while let's see if you can believe it Satan now and has been since that room and started he has the ability to enter ever individual I have never believed and never taught that the devil was born in you like I teach it the message you know I can't have the deviled over here no no you're born in Satan's domain well I can't have a devil made me do it we're gonna get down to some childish thinking after a while what is the age of accountability you know the child dies before the age of accountability it automatically goes to heaven that's what your prophet said so what is the age of accountability then what if that child does not come to the age of accountability in about 40 years old or if it dies for then age of accountability age of accountability age of accountability is when you realize you're a sinner now I'm quoting brother Branham when you find out you're a sinner that's the age of accountability that is accountable then from then on it's accountable because you know you take a little girl little boy 2 years old put him in the bathtub come on we raise kids okay lady in India she wrote me a letter one time say what's her name Cynthia she wrote me a letter one time she said brother Dale I'm trying to raise my kids like you said you raised your you take a little boy and a little girl two year to open them in about two of you ain't got no problem right would you take a little boy in a little girl about five years old put them in the bathtub they'll start looking at each other about seven years old they're gonna start doing other things so you don't put them in the bathtub not kids are different Oh glory my kids don't sin you forget it don't put them in the bathtub together well because they find out what's going on so what is the age of accountability it's when you become accountable and realize what's going on now that'll be valuable in a minute now here's the point that I've said a total I studied 40 years in the realm that we're living in which is Satan's domain there's I've got enough do you need that from the Prophet we're living in Satan's domain Satan ain't our daddy Satan ain't our daddy Satan can't give you a soul he perverts the nature of the soul but he can't give you a soul God can only give you a soul so every baby's baby is born and it don't matter whether mama and daddy are right or wrong I won't be glad to show you these things your prophet said there's denominations that believe your mom and daddy was good the baby goes to heaven if it dies you know little but said if they're wrong they'll go to hell he said I differ with that that's wrong he could called the blood of Jesus Christ atones for that child until it reaches the age of accountability you think about them little babies then when they die under the age of accountability they're going to heaven there's a compassion in God there's not a God of sympathy he's not sympathizing with the little kids he's a compassionate God he's doing what he said in the garden he's doing what he brought all the way through the Old Testament what salvation is based on whether or not you can believe salvation is based on whether or not you can believe and what does the Bible say about believing must believe that God is not he was or somewheres else these are Garda present tense trying to finish up our thoughts on the Old Testament ain't said I said I'm not finishing it now because we're taking the tops and the shadows and come true to still show salvation and in dealing with no side but gives them to point once Adam and Eve had done wrong then everybody born from that day on was born in sin according to the psalmist shapen in iniquity the spouse from your mother's wound and go forth alive now you won't find all em scriptures the way I quoted but you'll find it the way the prophet quoted it and you'll find its way the bible quotes but it's right right so Cain and Abel which Abel was just as perverted as Cain no no if I come from if I come from Adam I can be saved if I come from the Beast I can't be saved that's the doctrine in the people of this message they literally believe if you're born from Cain you know through that lineage you don't have a change but if you're born true Abel and coming where you wouldn't have much change with a people cuz he got killed so you better get it over to worse after that at least right would you understand everybody born died away when they reach the age of accountability and you determine what that is I've checked the prophets message for 40 years never heard him making a date see I've heard a lot about what he says is when you know the difference and right and wrong when you're when you come to a knowledge of something like I said about the little kids put them in the tub you know but then when they become to a knowledge of each other you better get them out of there like I said but my children are so wonderful they wouldn't do that you got a belly full of guts to come one day because you're gonna have a problem and when you do you're gonna come back and say what brother tell you and I've had people to do this they come and said what did I do wrong now I don't mean just I'm just using an example brother Dave I don't know what I done wrong but I'll let my kids play in the bathtub 15 years old you dummy you know what's he doing wrong I don't have to tell you cuz you know what you're going now argue with me come on I'm open tell me you and how beautiful you were and you say you're picking on me brother I'm picking on everybody in here not just one everybody in here but you want to have enough sense to know I said well he came but it did to me I know but it was everything 5050 see Satan used in the Old Testament the rim of memory reason conscience and things to get to the people to make them partake of the wrong things all right he not only done that through the memory reason conscious he done it through the soul of mankind because remember the Bible says zekiel 18 for all souls are mine so they ain't no show coming from the devil he said all souls are mine now what goes wrong with that soul how does it become sinful when it is created as perfect that's perfect it can be there's a lot different perfect in eternal so don't translate me in there ever person in the world they don't matter who the mom and daddy is that baby when it comes in the world that soul is this perfect as God could make it I don't care who it belongs to now you ain't going like this then who is it that allows the soul of that baby to wind up and get perverted oh now you you've got a wife preaching brother Dale you just Madeline now come on we're gonna meddle a whole lot more you tell me the truth you tell me the truth is that baby a sinner can't be a center until it reaches the age of accountability it's a product of seeing through Mama and Daddy but it is not a sinner until it reaches the age of accountability to know right and wrong did it become the sinner what is it until that time come on I got him play in here your prophet they asked him said what about baby sometimes he said even said you mean you got to have the Holy Ghost said you thought we got our home ghost ago in the rapture he said would you explain the babies to me he said all babies it don't matter what under the age of accountability through the blood of Jesus cry all babies go to heaven I used to think about it that God would tell those people David or some of them said go out to her and in Mirat senescence hid types or whatever he say just kill him everyone he said men and women and children kill him every one you think work hard I thought you was let's got a sympathy how can you allow them to kill them babies I can understand how you allow them to kill the grown-ups cuz that's sand and milled and don't what baby you realize all of them babies it was under the age of accountability he done him a favor he took their life and they'll go to heaven one day oh we didn't know that well it's time to wake up all babies go to heaven that's what Iran said will will will the illegitimate baby going to rapture he said now I can't hardly I don't understand that part but he said just remember all babies go to heaven now I'll give you a quote where he says now listen he says now the Bible doesn't say that you mean read it he said I say it he said on the basis of want to see well I've answered the question to a lot of people how many in your angle national raise of hands and please don't come ones turn around about do you realize that everybody in here could be illegitimate my mom and daddy was married you thought of old my mama no I'm telling the truth I love my mother I've told you over and over I respected her because she raised me but I also know that my mother was a woman mother you better not run it back you might find out a few things in the way you run it back down the line you might find and I'm not throwing slangs and nobody telling the truth you might find somebody a little bit darker colored in your race if you swore that there's no black race in my family see that's why you're wrong Church you take me and beat me down because I tell you the truth I'm just trying to tell you the truth I'm trying to tell it like he told it I don't care I don't care if I'm a legitimate ten generations I don't care the blood of Jesus Christ takes care of every bit of that right so it's not where mama and daddy was right it's whether or not we're right with Jesus Christ and then I throw it off on nobody I know you say he was shedding talk like that in front of people it sold off of my mama then they call brother Branham your mama paid you price between her and God she lived with her God you got to live to another things I ain't told nobody this your mama and daddy was this or that or the other I'm just trying to make a point I don't care if Mama and Daddy Bo was the illegitimate for 10 generations in my family it's the blood of Jesus Christ that I depend upon to make me appointed to to a place that I can believe in salvation then I made the statement from it at random do you believe that an illegitimate child going after he said now I don't know about that rapture he said but all babies go to heaven but just remember if that baby grows to the age of accountability and accepts Jesus Christ it ain't illegitimate no more ain't no cause if if the Bible would be writing the Old Testament to say 10 generations could bleed it out then why can't we believe in the blood of Jesus Christ bleeding and all the were we can thank God for the truth salvation is of the Lord any what mean you thinks about what we're doing but I've answered that question when they say well what do you think now let me give an illustration I won't call them name but it said family do you believe in a compassionate God or God or sympathy a God of sympathy you look like would take everybody but a God of compassion is where he can't break his word but you realize that until those babies reach the age of accountability I just ask you a simple question you mean you and your wife is gonna go in the rapture but you got a 2 year old baby is it going in the tribulation now come on I don't believe in that kind of a God I'd be a god of sympathy no I believe in a God of compassion do you understand what I'm getting at is he going to take the mom and daddy in the rapture but leave the babies here I don't agree with it so that I mean that's that's for me I'm playing all right I'm running out of time listen what was going on back there it's still going on now - mankind is in the same shape he's lost her he's lost now so God has to start dealing with mankind to bring us to salvation and as he starts dealing with us he's naturally going to have to start dealing with us in our sin our second dream which is memory reason conscience affections because that's his only in road to get to your soul brother Browns anything and soldiers and prison of leaders right says he can get that soldier stand still long enough the income to salvation but now here is where we're connected for what is man judged upon what is man judged we'll see we automatically think that a judgment is upon the basis of something we do or don't do right I mean it was a judgment a judgment is on the basis of something you do or don't do right I mean it for some reason you've done something you got to be judged right now think about it how is the heathen to be judged now you look up the word he's earnest Gentile it's all kind of it just simply means the best enough definition you come up for heathen is not this race of people or that race of people or that race of people it is simply a person who does not believe in Jesus Christ as his Savior if you know a better definition than a heathen we think of a heathen being those in Africa that never heard in brother Adam says before that girl can marry in that heathen tribe she has to go take a virgin C test and he said if it's something wrong said they'd kill her and him both what was his word and he said boy what would it be in America right how can a heathen be judged that knows nothing about your God now use it that way because see every even has a God of his own right India they got how many - brother Prakash 30,000 or 30 million 3 million yeah 3 million gods and goddesses so now this get the word God out of your mind that way a heathen is not a Jew or a Gentile see the Jew says the healing is the Gentile cuz he don't believe in God he believes in a God at some form some way some thoughts but he doesn't believe in the Jehovah so then the Jews would call everything around him either not signifying a different or you know mohammedans and this heaven isn't this and happened to Jeff's eyes and his sight no no it's anything that was contrary to believe in in Jehovah his Almighty God would be called a heathen now how is God gonna judge that heathen when he never hears the gospel he's taking what you want - when I heard the Prophet say the things that I just read for 40 years I've studied it I said Lord how can that be what would be the basis how will God judge someone who never hears of him I get to hater you don't believe um and ask you a question are you Jews or you Gentiles well well we're Gentiles with in the way we believe in one God the Jews don't believe in it so are they he then-- oh right you're not as you are you your believer in the Lord Jesus Christ and the Jews don't believe in that is he either what is it Eden he's an unbeliever what is he gonna like it how is a honest now listen let's get the word right LaRon says I got him laying here to be glad to read him we get to he says that God said a lot of people get the word sympathy and compassion messed up he said sympathy is like mankind he said compassion is to do the will of the Father he said like the Lord Jesus went into the pool and walked in there with all them people and said he healed one person and turned and walked out and watching he said then God is a God of compassion because he's doing the will of the Father a God of sympathy would have to heal every one of them now wait a minute I got said come on this stuff quote it to you I know he died for everybody I know that come on he wants everybody to be safe we know that we'll get the point God is not a God of sympathy is a God of compassion he stays with his word he'll keep his word and as I said when the prophet made these statements going over brothers to number eight over the message the handwriting on the wall in the book of Acts the 10th chapter in the 35th verse the Prophet said I perceive that God is no respect of nation or person but will accept such as will serve Him in righteousness no matter what church you belong to God expects you to what respect him God expects you to respect him and he wants you to serve Him in righteousness than what you if we fail to take them the gospel he's changing his style right they should have made another paragraph and brought it out but all right he said he wants you to serve him in Russia if we fail to take them the gospel who the heathen right then God will judge them according to the knowledge that they had and how respectable they were to it even if we don't take the gospel God is going to judge them according to the knowledge they had and how respectable they was to it mio canale you're talking about some kind of heater and can't go to heaven we ain't gonna take them to heaven taking the millennium for to go to heaven okay can we solve the problem go ahead to the next questions and answers 1962 they're talking about sowing the seed where's reaping of the seed Elisha and then it's return of the church and the bride the bride of Christ shall walk out upon their ashes in the Millennium when the earth is purified by fire and dire they shall reign remember the Bible speaks it's gonna rule and reign with him for a thousand years then watch you he said you got out something ruling right over come on and are they shall reign and the he turned that's never heard the gospel she'll be raised in that time this is the Millennium he just said it and the sons of God will be manifested if he's the rain he's got a house something rain over he's got a domain and they ruled and reigned with Christ and Christ ruling with a rod of iron the nations then the then the manifested sons of God with the authority just like he had when he was here see I will come the Millennium in that rain the ether is going to be in the Millennium to hear the gospel alright there you are you sure ain't no Baptist call.we Baptist believe you got to be born again to go to heaven anybody wants to pull up it the Prophet says there'll be a gospel to the heathen in the Millenium he said if we don't get it to him they'll be judged how by how they kept their own laws you mean see then he's not a goddess empathy sympathy would require him to save all kind no we've got a point now we're on a road running with it right forty-something yours now Lord would you please that tell me how you gonna get that he turned into the Millennium he said I'm gonna get them there because they keep their own laws they don't hear the gospel they don't hear nobody preach so they can't be judged on what they hear right so they're judged on what they do with their own laws but but that's a compassionate God they would take his own wheel in his own word and say listen if you won't take the gospel to them I'll just make a secondary way is that the quote we just read he said if we don't do it God will do it girl in the Millennium I didn't say that your prophet did I've never heard so nonsense and all of that you've got to do it some way through the blood of Jesus Christ well I would remind you that under the Old Testament they didn't have the blood of Jesus Christ all they had was speaking of it what about a compassionate God Church and wacked out a lot of thoughts but what about a compassionate God one who will do the will of the Father and the Father's will is that if you don't we don't take the gospel to the heathen he will bypass always and bring them up you say give me the scripture glad you thought of that back up to number seven glad you said give me the scripture I read it to you when we started did you listen me back on number seven where there is no respect of persons with God Romans 2 11 through 15 whereas many is that sin without the law she'll perish without the law in other words if you / if you die without having any law there is a benefits of following the law because he was with the tribes he was with the children of Israel you had a lot of benefits following the law well got people you could be with another so now what's he saying for as many as have sinned without the law in other words law ain't and effects are they seeing what's gonna happen she'll also purchase without the law cuz they ain't got nothing to represent them and as many as I've sinned in the law she'll be judged by the law so there's a group of people it's never heard the law they're not judged by the law they're judged by their own conscience we're gonna read that and what for as many as have sinned and his has been seen in the law she'll be judged by the law for not the hearers of the law or just before God but the doers of the law she'll be justified as that settled not to hear but to do her right now watch the Gentile be a doer of the law now what you gonna do with him even condemn him when he follows the law and you don't know what you're gonna do it said forty years folks I've studied it and pondered it we're not two hearers of the law just before God but the doers of the law shall be justified for when the Gentiles misused the word heathen they're okay when the Gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law in other words by nature by some nature something within them is motivating them to follow a right channel are you with me for when the Gentiles which have not the law do by nature you go to the some of you come from some of the tribes are different this use it as an example you know there was good people in those tribes right we'll get to that in a second cause I got some more questions asking they do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law or law into themselves they follow the law by nature not by the fact that they have to and what it does it gives them the effect of the law salvation right how they going to be in the Millennium salvation now what these Gentile these either which show the work of the law written in their hearts come on their currency it's also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another think about it think about how great God is he's not the God of sympathy is the God of compassion the word is rolled over and over so don't go haywire do on it get to pulling listen to what the Prophet says I'll be glad to give you those where he says compassion is to do the will of the Father alright let's read that where nobody won't get on the bandwagon and start screaming and hollering where's that okay go to number 12 which is taken from the earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now what hold that in your mind sometimes you don't know what compassion means friend the people are so bound listen he says they're bound they don't understand heavenly things you remember what I said well ago we can talk about sympathy we can talk about compassion but let's talk about it the way God talks about it right we don't see compassion is to do the will of God not sympathy there's a lot of difference between sympathy and compassion dropping down to earth that's the way with human compassion and God's compassion compassion in the rims of spirit means to do the will of him that sent you human compassion is sympathy that's all there is sympathy moon dancers we would see Jesus there's two different types of compassion one of them is human sympathy the other one is godly compassion godly compassion is to do the will of God human sympathy droves everything in a puddle because the next one be not afraid it's verily verily I say unto you I can the son does nothing in himself with what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise that's compassion now am i quoting brother Branham through what he said he said when it when he was speaking like that in other words he's seen it he's seen the man that he walked in the pool and healed before he got there because he said I do nothing till my father shows me he knew it so the compassion was to do the will of the Father go in and heal the man he saw that would be healed and walk out sympathy would be try to heal everybody compassion is followed the will of God human sympathy not compassion oh it's two different types altogether sympathy and compassion are you listening so now let's take that heathen for a minute that he learned by his own laws in his tribes he lives the best again he's not a born again believer so don't even argue no something at me these straight listen he can only be judged of God by how much he follows the laws and the things that are surrounding him that's what Paul said he said that girl has to be taken out and check to see now that's pretty good laws on it now what are those laws to a heathen what are those laws make a book of rules what what are those laws the Bible talks about being an answer of a good conscience you realize the heathen then is gonna be judged on this conscience you'll be judged whether he's born again or not and I'm gonna do it he's gonna be judged by his conscience the Bible says you sear your conscience now I want to ask you two questions one is a baby born mean I'm asking you to answer your own question is a baby born mean you're mighty quiet cause you know for sure that I know what I'm talking about a baby ain't born mean it learns to be mean it sees and does as others it learns to be mean so he's in a sinner no he said well what are you talking about I'm talking about a baby till it reaches the age of accountability it is born perfectly thoughts and everything but as it becomes in time it learns to be mean in other words you take what you want to from this you and me trained our own children to be what they are now argue with me come on somebody get up come up here and tell me I'm wrong but you're going to be facing 40 years of studied of the Word of God to be one thing that's why I'm not afraid to say it you and me taught our children to be wrong like I've always said when the baby is born in a in a cradle born in a hospital what does it do it wakes up and the first thing that hears is a nurse is cussing and snorting by talking and hollering and screaming at each other calling each other names the baby is trained to do wrong you say brother Dale are you pointing to me I'm pointing at everybody in here we trained our children to be wrong I've always told you don't you dare slap that child in the face you'll answer to me if you do it's got a bottom in the place you can work on go you slap it in the face what's it gonna grow up to do it's gonna slap it come on am i right why is it the children they were molested my parents biggest portion of the time wind up molesting their own children am i right 40 years Lord give me an answer take a line and allow them and put it in the cage together as a baby all right they grow up to be great companions right and we're right they don't kill each other even when they get old enough they don't kill each other something has to create that atmosphere to make that animal kill that other one something has to try it and say let's go I find match Golden Rock not knowing how long we've all failed to raise our children in the right order we remember how you raise that child is what that child is going to be when it reaches the age of accountability it's gonna do what you walking out there how many of your father's know you walking alone not so brother Lewis words yeah he's hiding somewhere and he's got that walk well you want some kids they don't have that walk falling in my daddy's footsteps right that is telling Walt like that they learned if we what they're looking you raise your children in the admonition of the Lord don't you raise your children this away though don't you raise your children and tell them that God hates you cause you're mean you ain't got enough gumption to use a spanking spoon the law even now says you than you the belt you can't use planking spoons or hickories but it bypasses the belt do you understand what I'm getting at you said I've done the best I could do with my children I failed I failed because a lot of see we want them raised our way tell your story that happened Terrence one time we were going to brother would mr. priests Darren said daddy I don't want to go I said son you're going he's a dead head I want to go home they'll have to he's 16 years old I said you're going son well you know what he done he sneaked out and got gone for the time that we was going to leave and when he come back we didn't go we didn't go he said are you just stupid no I wanted to prove one point when he came in he said daddy why didn't you go I said because of what you've done and I didn't go preach for the weekend he said daddy he turned around he said wilt me that's a no sir he knows what I say it I says you've got your own whip it your own whip and had done been given to you and he ain't forgot that till this day he got his whipping and I never had to touch him see we think that we've got to do this and do that why did brother Brown say he said never whipped that child until you first want talk to him or consider what they're doing how many of us done that yeah we expect our children to be right we go out and do wrong and our children do wrong then we whip them for doing wrong that's that's good innit you said what are you getting at I'm getting at one time after 40 years the Lord speaking to me I've come to one conclusion man would be judged by his own conscious you say yeah but I'm born again your conscience still bothers you if it don't something wrong remember your conscious is in your second rim you don't look at your children sometimes and say Lord I wish I'd have done different you ever apologize to your children you know we come up through the rules and regulations of the message you know you can talk to these kids and find out some of you that didn't come up that way we come up rules and regulations that our children had to do this and they had to do that they take them out of school in Georgia and send them to Alabama and take the ones out of Alabama and send them to Georgia where they could bypass the laws who calls brother Brown said him and then schools is of the devil ain't letting my chances go screw the devil take him out of school put him to work the public job put him to work the public job that's not worse if the devil oh but we raised our children right you ask the people this magic I don't see why my children like they are I raised them right I've apologized to the kids the same I didn't do it right but if you don't get the point I'll give it to you in one other point I said it while ago now let's think about it what is the age of accountability we've concluded that it is the point of in the life of a person that they reach that they become knowledgeable of right and wrong but what if you lived in some country where there's countries overseas they still have polygamy well that's God that they're gonna be condemned for being polygamous no cuz that's their tribes and their laws but they're gonna be judged how they handle the polygamy I like brother Theo Erasmus I got I loved a brother he said they went and found a group of people over there living in the ground and he said they was just wasn't married or nothing they just lived with each other and slept in this had babies over and they wanted to become Christians you know he said does have a meeting he said we're gonna solve this problem took them out lined them up said all right there you are who's your wife well I got eight pick out one cause that's gonna be your wife from now now what could you done under his situation he said yeah but that would've left 7up and it didn't have a husband if brother Theo was any man at all you know what he said you got one wife you live with one not one wife and husband wife but you don't support the mother seven now you tell me that ain't a Christian attitude see we're not dealing with things as Christian attitude a lot we're dealing with things of what we want the way we want to do and what we want to do that's what I've said for 40 years I prayed God show me some way to understand that either and why you would allow him he said he's keeping the laws of his land and said I'm honoring him for keeping them laws because what happens to a guy that don't keep the laws it turned out to be me oh we're not through with the story what happens to a man in the tribe that's mean out of the tribe or off the head right I'm not throwing off on none of you black people now you get this me and you own if you don't run this thing straight it's your problem and I ain't never had no racism I didn't have it for coming this message not sure you got it now I'm just using the illustration what about those heathen be in the Millennium and you know what if they're in the Millennium now you tell me they're gonna be cast into hell I'm gonna tell you I don't believe that I don't believe they're gonna be judged in the millennium and say all right so you go you can go to heaven but you going to hell you gonna have them you're gonna help now I forget it don't bring that to me cuz he done got him to the Millennium they're gonna go in and remember there's gonna be people around that city there's going to be either a to see he and the bride is going to be in the city and it matches her without side of either kings of the earth they bring their honor and glory into that city and you just think about that little old brother he said I don't understand why he'd choose me you know what now here's where we're going where we're going differ for opinion cards gonna look at him and say you done by nature the inside of a person that knows nothing about me but yet you followed my word by your own inward nature that's what Paul said you don't read it again and sitting there by you've been allowed to enter in God is a compassionate God you got a guard a sympathy let's tan sorry for being a little late wanting to get it out in the heart we ain't finished we just started you see I believe in compassion not sympathy but that we sympathize with everything right well come on I sympathize with somebody see I see these children I do especially the children or something and so those children come over here to be prayed for and I see them not receive right then what they're asking for I just inside upset God where did I do wrong then not afraid God where did I do wrong why didn't that child get healed I don't blame anything else I'd blame myself you see a God of compassion is different than the God of sympathy and when we get the nature of that God come on the heathen by his own laws and the way he lives by is where he's gonna be able to go hello but I've never heard anything like you teach brother day I never I thought we had to do this and I thought we had to do that I thought it had to be if you don't understand may I say it one more time what did God look at in you to save you you answer me a question was there any good thing within us that he could look at to save us I wouldn't be anything that would cause him to even deal with us come on I'm saying something that you're gonna probably argue with me about it but remember he's looking at that nature that's within you you know what I'm talking about there's people who have good natures but there's a lot of people in hide that nature being beans the devil okay but they are peaceful that just have a good nature about him what does God look at to bring him towards you your nature your ability to believe he's the ability to believe yeah because a lot of people can't believe see some of you in some one Internet you've already sealed it off and said I don't believe what that man talking about I've told you if I'm wrong I've had 40 years to study and pray and that's God why God would you choose me why would you choose anybody and he looks down and he says because you accepted me then I could come and fulfill whether I had already accepted you before the foundation in the world I could transmit it down to you like I said what is an unconditional covenant you mean you think you're living under unconditional codn't you can live like the devil you are the devil that's the best way to say it an unconditional covenant don't give you the right sin do wrong and halt and cover all of it remember the Bible we're going to give an account for the deeds done in the body whether good or bad that's Christians that's not sinners that's Christians so it's not just an unconditional they don't matter what I do that's worse than a Baptist I'll come out of the Baptist Church so don't argue with me about it that's worse than they did there's things they wouldn't do that some of you do they wouldn't do it for nothing in the world the worst sin of all is to doubt go ahead what do we got sorry 20 after nine I'm sorry they had to take a little bit to get it out I know see I believe in a compassionate God but do the will of the Father might have water here seaweeds still got a lot of Scripture working the thing form say why did you form me this is what right when he did inform us out of what we might access sinners that's why the age of accountability I can't be no one certain age is when you realize if you're doing wrong you've become accountable and a compassionate God not to sympathize with us but to tell us that this is the windiest I'll do what I want to do yes because I'll do according to my word remember he can't break his word so when he judges the healer at the Millennium it's his word that's sadly to be done you can't condemn him for that cause he's done done it in form can't say why did you form me such have a name [Music] father we thank you for tonight we pray that what we said would be acceptable to your people that they would believe it Lord to just realize that those four oh he's earned that never heard of honey but yet you gonna give them a change but yet you're not gonna leave us out of it because they're gonna be our be there for us to speak to them about you what a wonderful God no wonder you're the God of compassion not the God of sympathy you know what your word says and you'll do what your word says no wonder the little virgin standing there said be it unto me according to thy word because she called it you be it under this church according to that word whatever it takes to drive us to a place to get us to the right understanding the directress into your love lord we've tried to say the best we could will be misunderstood about the way we approach him but nice I can't help that Lord I've just said it because Lord you're gonna judge us by your word and what we do with it and maybe that he's earned that's never heard maybe he's never reached the age of accountability because he has nothing but his own rule of law what do we have Lord just forgive us go with us on the way home take care of everybody in Jesus name you dismiss remember Bible study Saturday [Music] Oh freez Calvary's tree I love you yes I love him [Music]
