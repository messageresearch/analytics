[39:43] holy
[39:46] holy
[39:48] holy holy
[39:51] holy I want to see
[39:56] you amen is that your heart's desire
[39:59] tonight amen uh just reading the the
[40:03] prophet in a certain
[40:09] area up at the top all right and the
[40:13] prophet told us he said if we had a
[40:15] desire for God to see us or for us to
[40:18] see God rather that he would make a way
[40:19] for us to be able to see him and I
[40:22] believe if we desire that and we look
[40:24] for it that God will make a way that we
[40:25] can see him and uh more than anything in
[40:28] my life I want to see him in his power
[40:31] and His glory and the power of his
[40:33] resurrection and I believe that God is
[40:35] able to make a way that we can see him
[40:38] amen and we certainly didn't come here
[40:39] just to see one another as much as we
[40:41] love that and we love to fellowship with
[40:43] one another and see familiar faces and
[40:46] friends but more than anything we want
[40:47] to see him amen and I believe that if we
[40:50] have that desire and expectation the
[40:52] prophet taught us that God would never
[40:54] disappoint us and so we believe that
[40:56] with all of our hearts we just just want
[40:57] to go to the Lord in a word of prayer
[40:59] and before we look to the word if you
[41:01] have a need upon your heart why don't
[41:03] you just lift your hand up to the Lord
[41:04] and ask him to remember you and speak to
[41:06] you and uh I believe with all my heart
[41:09] that God still answers prayer and God
[41:11] still moves he still restores he still
[41:14] refills and uh the limit is what our
[41:17] faith is and so I believe our faith
[41:20] should raise to the occasion so let's
[41:21] just bow our hearts together father Lord
[41:23] we love you with all of our hearts
[41:25] tonight Lord and we're so honored and
[41:26] prived to be assembled together Lord on
[41:29] this side of Eternity one more time and
[41:31] Lord we thank you for your grace and
[41:33] your mercy and for the opportunity to
[41:35] stand in your presence and Lord what a
[41:38] wonderful presence as we just feel like
[41:40] one great big family here tonight Lord
[41:42] and we know it's because we're United
[41:44] under the greatest message that struck
[41:46] the face of this Earth since the time of
[41:49] Christ and Lord we believe we're all
[41:51] Lord here gathered together under one
[41:54] common cause and that's to see you Lord
[41:56] and the power of your Resurrection Lord
[41:59] as we're celebrating such a wonderful
[42:01] time lord as you rose from the dead and
[42:03] Lord you ascended upon high and gave
[42:05] gifts unto men Lord because of all the P
[42:08] the price that you paid you made a way
[42:10] that we could be here and Lord we just
[42:12] want to thank you for that and we
[42:14] believe with all of our hearts here
[42:15] today Lord that you're not in a tomb
[42:18] buried somewhere in Jerusalem but Lord
[42:20] you're here in the power of your spirit
[42:22] and the power of your word and we
[42:24] believe that with all of our hearts
[42:25] tonight Lord we just invite you into
[42:28] this building we pray Lord that you
[42:29] would Minister to your children may you
[42:32] encourage the discourage Lord may you
[42:34] bind up the broken hearted may you heal
[42:36] the sick and The Afflicted Lord all of
[42:38] these things are in your word and we
[42:40] know your word is your will so Lord we
[42:43] just ask you to help us to get out of
[42:44] your way as we look to your word Lord
[42:47] may you just anoint our hearts and our
[42:49] ears to hear and receive what you have
[42:51] for us and Lord when we leave this place
[42:53] may we have the testimony that did not
[42:55] our hearts burn within us as you spoke
[42:57] with us along the way bless us now Lord
[42:59] as we look to your word we humbly pray
[43:02] these things in The Wonderful Name of
[43:03] Jesus Christ amen and the church
[43:07] said amen if you have your Bibles we'll
[43:09] go straight into the scripture in the
[43:11] Book of John and the 20th chapter we'll
[43:14] begin reading at the 19th verse and you
[43:16] pray for my voice we've been uh
[43:18] ministering the past two nights in a row
[43:20] and I just somehow worked out we were
[43:22] night after night after night so uh you
[43:24] pray that the Lord will help me and uh I
[43:27] believe that he will and we just greet
[43:29] you tonight in the name of the Lord and
[43:30] certainly count of a great honor and
[43:31] privilege to be here and speak to you
[43:33] and we've heard so many wonderful things
[43:35] about this church my first time being
[43:37] here but I believe we're all part of the
[43:38] family of God and uh some of these
[43:41] brothers here I know brother Aaron and
[43:42] brother uh Louise and brother Bob and
[43:45] many of you people I don't know but I
[43:48] believe that in eternity we'll all have
[43:50] a lot of time to get to know one another
[43:52] and uh we all have the same father and
[43:55] we all love this message with all of our
[43:57] hearts and we're United under it and I
[43:59] believe that with all of my heart and so
[44:01] we just say God bless you uh tonight and
[44:03] we want to read here uh in in John 20
[44:06] and 19 the Bible this would be what we
[44:09] would call a post-resurrection scripture
[44:11] it is after the Lord uh has risen from
[44:14] the dead here in John 20 and 19 the
[44:16] Bible would read this then the same day
[44:18] at evening being the first day of the
[44:21] week when the doors were shut where the
[44:23] disciples were assembled for fear of the
[44:25] Jews came Jesus
[44:27] and stood in the midst and saith unto
[44:29] them peace be unto you now we know that
[44:32] the prophet took a message out of that
[44:35] in Shalom and said that was the message
[44:36] to the bride uh that it was Shalom amen
[44:40] a message of peace and when he had so
[44:43] said he showed unto them his hands and
[44:45] his side and then were the disciples
[44:49] glad when they saw the Lord amen you
[44:52] ever been there before when you when you
[44:54] see the Lord and causes you to be glad
[44:57] and then Jesus said to them peace be
[44:58] unto you as my father has sent me even
[45:02] so send I you and when he had said this
[45:05] he breathed on them and saith unto them
[45:08] receive ye the Holy Ghost amen Mark 16
[45:12] let's read the 14th verse down to the
[45:14] 19th this is also after Jesus is
[45:18] resurrected afterward he
[45:20] appeared unto the
[45:23] 11 as they sat at me and I braided them
[45:25] with their unbelief and Hardness of
[45:27] Heart because they believed not them
[45:29] which had seen him after he was risen
[45:31] and he said unto them go ye unto all the
[45:34] world and preach the gospel to Every
[45:36] Creature we know that was the commission
[45:38] that Christ started and Christ has not
[45:40] took away that commission but that's
[45:42] still our commission in this in time is
[45:45] to go to the world and preach the gospel
[45:47] and he that believeth and is baptized
[45:49] shall be saved but he that believeth not
[45:52] shall be damned very simple scripture
[45:55] and these signs shall follow them that
[45:56] believe in my name shall they cast out
[45:59] devils and they shall speak with new
[46:00] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[46:03] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[46:05] not hurt them and they shall lay hands
[46:07] on the sick and they shall recover so
[46:10] then after the Lord had spoken unto them
[46:11] he was received up into into heaven and
[46:15] sat on the right hand of God we just
[46:16] pray that God would bless his word as
[46:18] you can be seated I don't know if this
[46:20] is a monitor here if you can help me any
[46:22] way on the monitors would help my voice
[46:24] a lot but we want to speak to you uh
[46:26] tonight on uh if it would title I want
[46:28] to speak to you on influenced by the
[46:31] resurrection amen influenced by the
[46:33] resurrection as we read that scripture
[46:35] there in John 20 a very very powerful
[46:38] scripture and I believe we can see
[46:40] prophecy uh that lays within that
[46:42] scripture there in John 20 then the same
[46:45] day at evening being the first day of
[46:47] the week when the doors were shut where
[46:49] the disciples were assembled for fear of
[46:51] the Jews came Jesus and stood in the
[46:54] midst and saith unto them peace be unto
[46:55] you so I want you to notice it was at
[46:58] the evening time that the Lord came to
[47:00] them and was shut in with the disciples
[47:03] and begin to uh reveal to them who he
[47:06] was and we know that that happened in
[47:08] the evening time and the prophet here in
[47:11] the message evidence of the Resurrection
[47:12] very powerful message he said here and
[47:15] notice all through the day he had been
[47:17] bringing the word but no signs when he
[47:20] got them inside and shut the door and
[47:22] sat down oh brother that's when he
[47:24] revealed his resurrection amen when they
[47:26] got them inside and shut the door he
[47:29] revealed his resurrection no time from
[47:32] the morning when he met them until the
[47:34] going down of the son did he do it he
[47:36] never did one thing that he did in life
[47:39] only just the word but notice at the
[47:41] evening time it was at the evening time
[47:44] that's when he proved his resurrection
[47:47] amen at the evening time is when he
[47:49] proved his resurrection so we know uh
[47:52] that the Lord did not prove his
[47:54] resurrection a as soon as he res
[47:56] resurrected from the dead he did not
[47:58] prove his resurrection as soon as he uh
[48:02] came out of the Tomb there but he proved
[48:04] his resurrection at the evening of that
[48:07] same day he did not do it in the morning
[48:09] and just to just to stop here we know
[48:11] that the Lord did not prove his
[48:13] resurrection there in the Ephesian
[48:15] Church age or or all throughout the
[48:17] other Church ages but God uh again has
[48:20] proved his resurrection in this evening
[48:22] time Amen in this ly and church age
[48:25] there has been a return
[48:27] of the resurrected Christ upon the face
[48:30] of the Earth in the form of his word
[48:32] amen and he has proved himself again in
[48:35] this end time to be alive and to be well
[48:38] we know the prophet taught us that he
[48:40] said that that all throughout the church
[48:42] ages they've been bringing the word we
[48:43] know that God sent a major prophet there
[48:46] at the beginning of the church ages in
[48:47] the Ephesian Church age and he sent a
[48:50] prophet at the end of it and all through
[48:52] between that would be reformers that
[48:54] would try to reform back to the word but
[48:57] we know at that very end age at the
[49:00] evening time is when God would come and
[49:03] would perform that Messiah sign again
[49:05] and we know that that Messiah sign would
[49:07] be a proof of the resurrected Lord Jesus
[49:10] and uh here in the true Easter SE
[49:13] brother R would say this he said now for
[49:15] some 19900 years or maybe I'll say 14 or
[49:17] 1500 years he said why the church has
[49:20] had him sealed away the church has had
[49:23] him sealed away but he said it shall
[49:25] come to pass in the last days saith God
[49:28] and the prophet said see there's nothing
[49:30] going to stop it that there will be
[49:32] light in the evening time and the works
[49:34] that I do shall you do also it shall be
[49:38] light in the evening time and notice
[49:41] this he said I don't care how many seals
[49:43] you try to put over God he will break
[49:46] every seal he broke the Seal of the Tomb
[49:49] he broke the Seal of hell he broke the
[49:51] Seal of death he broke the Seal of the
[49:53] grave and arose forever more and tried
[49:56] outfit over the grave over death over
[49:59] hell over tombs and over every manmade
[50:02] thing that there was to show that he was
[50:05] God and cannot be sealed away from the
[50:07] people anymore now listen friends amen
[50:10] the church wanted to keep Jesus in the
[50:12] Tomb they they're fine as long as he's
[50:14] lord they're fine as long as he's
[50:16] Messiah they're fine as long as he's
[50:18] savior but but you don't let him be
[50:21] ruler and don't let him be Supreme Lord
[50:24] over my life and listen friends amen the
[50:26] Church world out there has tried to put
[50:28] him in the Tomb and we know what the
[50:30] prophet taught us he said what has the
[50:32] church world done today that they had
[50:34] put them back on a cross he said what
[50:37] they do they took and denominational
[50:40] Roman Creed nails and they crucified him
[50:43] back on the cross they they did not want
[50:45] that resurrected Lord in their church
[50:47] but listen friends what a difference the
[50:50] bride of Christ has from the nominal
[50:52] Church World brother if the Lord ain't
[50:54] here we don't want to be here if he's
[50:57] not here in the power of his
[50:58] resurrection we don't want to be here
[51:00] either amen what a difference we say
[51:03] Amen don't put him back on a cross he
[51:05] only had to do that one time amen let
[51:08] him be here in the power of His might he
[51:11] said there's nothing they could do to
[51:14] seal him in the Amen in that tomb
[51:16] anymore nothing could hold him I just
[51:19] love this he said my the grave could not
[51:21] be du deep enough hell could not be hot
[51:24] enough and nothing could hold him him he
[51:27] broke every seal with that great amen
[51:30] with that great Easter seal that he was
[51:32] sealed with amen how they tried to seal
[51:35] them away we know there in the scripture
[51:37] that they set a watch and they they
[51:39] tried to seal them there they they tried
[51:41] to stop that Resurrection from happening
[51:44] but I tell you friends I'm so glad to
[51:46] know that there's not a power Amen in
[51:49] Hell upon the face of this Earth that
[51:51] was able to hold him and keep him in
[51:54] that tomb and there's still not a power
[51:57] on this Earth today that can hold our
[51:59] Lord down and that can keep him from
[52:02] moving in the power of His might and I
[52:04] believe that with all my heart and as
[52:06] you read that scripture it was at the
[52:08] evening of the same day and my the
[52:10] evening time is just a special time
[52:12] isn't it amen the evening time that
[52:15] there's so many scriptures you can go
[52:16] into amen but as you look there in that
[52:19] scripture at the evening time that he
[52:21] breathed on them the breath of the Holy
[52:24] Ghost at the evening time is when he
[52:26] revealed himself to cleopas and his
[52:29] friend it was at the evening time that
[52:31] he he did something you say what was he
[52:33] doing he was trying to influence their
[52:36] faith he he was trying to in amen isn't
[52:39] it powerful that when he resurrected
[52:41] from the dead he didn't go to Pontius
[52:44] pilot and go to see and go to all the
[52:46] kings of that world Amen he didn't go to
[52:48] all the Earth and say look at me I'm the
[52:50] one you put on the cross and I'm the one
[52:53] you did he didn't reveal himself to
[52:55] everybody he was not worried about
[52:57] having influence on them but the people
[53:00] that he did go to he he went to a a man
[53:03] by the name of Peter that was a
[53:04] discouraged fisherman and that was down
[53:07] and out and said they they put my Lord
[53:09] in a tomb and who did Jesus go to he
[53:12] went to Peter and he and he went to his
[53:15] disciples and what was he doing he was
[53:17] influencing their faith by the power of
[53:20] the Resurrection he was influencing them
[53:23] to tell them hey I'm not in a tomb no
[53:26] longer
[53:26] but I am alive forever more you say what
[53:30] did he do he went to deliver them from
[53:33] their discouragement and he went to
[53:35] deliver them from any unbelief they
[53:37] would have and listen friends the same
[53:40] Lord Jesus wants to do the same thing in
[53:43] the evening time in this church hey I'm
[53:46] not serving a different Lord Jesus if he
[53:49] came to Peter in a time of
[53:51] discouragement surely he's the same God
[53:54] and he could come to us in our time time
[53:56] of discouragement and do a familiar
[54:00] thing amen ain't that powerful you look
[54:02] at those two that was on the road to and
[54:05] there they're sh in you know the
[54:06] scripture says they constrained him to
[54:08] come in they constrained him to come in
[54:12] amen and Jesus is there teaching to them
[54:14] brother Wade we know the scripture says
[54:16] that he was there teaching them all the
[54:18] way from the book of Moses and said the
[54:20] Lord your God shall raise a prophet like
[54:22] unto me and he started at Moses and all
[54:25] throughout the day
[54:27] Christ had been bringing the word and
[54:29] bringing the word and they still didn't
[54:30] know him they still didn't know this was
[54:33] the Lord in his resurrected form but
[54:37] when they got shut in amen Jesus did
[54:40] something that was familiar we don't
[54:42] know exactly what he did but he did
[54:45] something familiar and their eyes come
[54:48] open and they knew him and listen Church
[54:51] in this evening time we have seen the we
[54:54] have seen the side of the m
[54:57] and we have recognized there that's the
[54:59] same thing that happened with the woman
[55:01] at the well that's the same thing
[55:03] happened amen when philli called
[55:06] Nathaniel and said come see this man and
[55:09] he said Phillip oh he said Nathaniel
[55:11] before Phillip called Mee I saw you and
[55:14] you was under the Fig
[55:16] Tree amen friends that was all they
[55:19] needed they realize this is Messiah and
[55:23] I tell you what friends TR amen for the
[55:25] True Body of Christ
[56:26] when the Lord begins to amen sweep down
[56:29] into the church and begins to move in
[56:31] the power of a spirit the preacher don't
[56:33] have to tell you he's here amen the amen
[56:36] your neighbor don't have to tell you
[56:37] he's here you'll see him in the power of
[56:40] His glory amen and you'll say I'm glad
[56:43] that I saw the Lord I'm glad that I saw
[56:46] him move in his Sanctuary amen you'll
[56:50] have a revelation that's none other than
[56:52] the
[56:53] Lord when they saw him they were glad
[56:56] they were sad when they saw him they
[56:58] were glad they they weren't unhappy you
[57:00] you take a Believer friends when they
[57:02] when they see the Lord moving in power
[57:05] and moving in anointing they are glad
[57:08] when they see that they're they're happy
[57:10] let me just say this there is nothing
[57:12] like the presence of the Lord there
[57:14] ain't no there ain't no higher high than
[57:17] when you get in the presence of God
[57:19] Almighty there's no better peace than
[57:22] when you get in that presence there's no
[57:24] better life amen outside of living in
[57:27] the presence of the king amen it's
[57:30] amazing when you study the ministry of
[57:32] Christ those 33 years he was upon the
[57:35] Earth and you would think being the very
[57:37] Messiah everybody would know him
[57:39] everybody would recognize him but you
[57:41] realize the prophet taught us something
[57:43] he said he only came to those who were
[57:45] looking for him amen he only came and
[57:49] revealed himself to those who were
[57:51] looking for him Amen in Awakening Jesus
[57:54] the prophet says it this way he said now
[57:56] remember it won't go to everybody when
[57:58] Jesus was on the earth not over onethird
[58:01] of the Jewish race ever knew he was on
[58:04] the earth amen but he says this he said
[58:06] you know that he come to the elected he
[58:10] come to the elected and they received it
[58:13] amen listen it ain't a coincidence you
[58:15] came across this message amen it ain't a
[58:18] coincidence you come across the truth
[58:21] amen because you're elected of God
[58:23] Almighty that is the reason the truth
[58:25] has crossed your path and you recognized
[58:29] it because you was elected to recognize
[58:32] it he come to his elected and he
[58:35] revealed himself that as elected amen as
[58:37] great as he was yet he only revealed
[58:40] himself to a small class of people he
[58:42] could have went to all the Earth he
[58:44] could have went to all the nations but
[58:46] he did not do that amen I've heard but
[58:48] now I see the prophet in another place
[58:50] he said just the elected understood who
[58:52] he was just think about it amen the
[58:55] elected understood who he was maybe 3
[58:57] million people 3 million Jews on Earth
[59:00] but maybe only onethird of them knew who
[59:02] he was he said see he revealed himself
[59:05] to those who were
[59:07] waiting he revealed himself to those who
[59:10] were waiting to those who were looking
[59:13] for him and I I be to study in some of
[59:15] these areas and it took me back there to
[59:17] the three mag eyes there in the New
[59:18] Testament and we know the prophet taught
[59:21] very powerful things about those three
[59:22] mag eyes he said those three mag eyes
[59:25] they were constantly looking up into the
[59:27] stars now I'll come back around to my
[59:29] text here in a minute but they were
[59:30] constantly looking up into the Stars how
[59:32] many knows that God had three Bibles the
[59:34] prophet taught us he had one in the
[59:36] stars and one in the pyramids and his
[59:38] written bible that was God's three
[59:40] Bibles and those three M eyes were they
[59:43] were they had their eyes fastened upon
[59:45] the stars and they knew when this star
[59:47] lines up with this star and this star
[59:49] lines up with this star that means that
[59:51] Messiah is on the face of the earth when
[59:55] God's Bible in the heavens lines up in
[59:58] this manner it means that Messiah is on
[1:00:01] the face of the Earth and brother their
[1:00:03] eyes were fixed upon that star and it
[1:00:06] influenced them amen it influenced them
[1:00:10] and as they look to the Stars it led
[1:00:12] them to where the Messiah was are you
[1:00:15] hearing me tonight amen it led them to
[1:00:18] where the Messiah was and when they came
[1:00:21] to the Messiah what did they say they
[1:00:22] said we have seen his star and we have
[1:00:26] come to worship Him and oh my it's the
[1:00:29] same exact thing in this evening time
[1:00:32] amen God has sent a star on the face of
[1:00:35] this Earth amen he was the Earthly
[1:00:37] messenger he was the Earthly star and he
[1:00:40] has influenced us back to Christ the
[1:00:43] word and listen we did not come looking
[1:00:46] for William Brandon but we came and the
[1:00:49] star has led us back to Christ you
[1:00:52] cannot separate this message in Christ
[1:00:55] you can not separate this message and
[1:00:58] the Bible it is the
[1:01:00] unfailing revelation of this Bible you
[1:01:04] can't separate it brother
[1:01:06] sister amen we have seen the star and
[1:01:09] it's led us to where he is is that right
[1:01:11] let me tell you friends amen the prophet
[1:01:13] in our in our generation he didn't come
[1:01:15] to lead us to a church he he didn't come
[1:01:18] to influence us to his ministry or or to
[1:01:21] a denomination or or to this or to that
[1:01:24] he come the influence us to turn our
[1:01:27] hearts back to the faith of the
[1:01:29] Pentecostal fathers that's exactly what
[1:01:32] he came to do he come to put the
[1:01:34] influence where it needed to be it was
[1:01:37] the message of restoration and I say my
[1:01:39] heart has been turned amen my heart has
[1:01:42] been restored unto the faith of Jesus
[1:01:46] Christ amen they saw that star friends
[1:01:49] and it led them to where he was
[1:01:52] Hallelujah you ever want to amen you
[1:01:54] ever want to get led to where Christ is
[1:01:56] just look to the star amen listen
[1:01:59] friends the prophet taught us he said
[1:02:01] look at all them Pharisees in the days
[1:02:03] of Jesus they were looking for him he
[1:02:05] said but they was looking in all the
[1:02:07] wrong places they was looking for the
[1:02:10] corridors of Heaven to open up but the
[1:02:13] prophet said they missed him because he
[1:02:16] came in a way they did not think he
[1:02:18] would come and their eyes did not see
[1:02:21] him because they were looking in the
[1:02:24] wrong place and let me say this friend
[1:03:09] [Music]
[1:03:26] be the only one calling all the shots I
[1:03:28] don't think God he should be the only I
[1:03:31] think what is it it's that Spirit of the
[1:03:33] devil I I don't think that God should be
[1:03:35] the one doing all this I want to be like
[1:03:38] him I want to be like the most high and
[1:03:41] what did he do he came to all of the
[1:03:43] angels and begin to preach to them we
[1:03:45] know the prophet taught us these thing
[1:03:47] he be to preach to a third of the angels
[1:03:50] and said listen guys let me let me give
[1:03:52] you a most beautiful sermon we know the
[1:03:54] devil's a good preacher isn't he all he
[1:03:56] has to do was give you 99% truth with
[1:03:59] just 1% falseness and I'll have you
[1:04:02] whipped completely right there that's
[1:04:04] exactly right it was just one word in
[1:04:06] the Garden of Eden that threw the whole
[1:04:08] human race into the fall that's exactly
[1:04:11] true and Lucifer is up there in the
[1:04:13] heavens and he he begins to preach into
[1:04:16] the angels and we know the Bible in the
[1:04:17] Book of Revelation said that by the tail
[1:04:20] of the serpent that he drew a third of
[1:04:22] the angels with him and we know I think
[1:04:25] God for this message don't you he said
[1:04:27] it was not the tail of the serpent it
[1:04:29] was the t a l e that he said and he was
[1:04:33] such a good preacher that he had so much
[1:04:36] influence to them and the Bible said he
[1:04:40] deceived a third of the angels in heaven
[1:04:43] so don't you ever tell me the devil
[1:04:44] ain't a smart devil he is don't you tell
[1:04:47] me he's not a good preacher he is a very
[1:04:49] good preacher if he could preach such a
[1:04:52] good sermon that he could deceive a
[1:04:54] third of the Angels what do you think
[1:04:56] he's doing on the Earth
[1:04:58] today he's going out to deceive that's
[1:05:01] exactly the truth and he came in and
[1:05:03] broke the influence that was there and
[1:05:06] we can see this Spirit you you know the
[1:05:08] prophet taught these things and it's so
[1:05:10] amazing to see that trail of the serpent
[1:05:12] throughout the Bible amen I'm just going
[1:05:15] to stop right here and put this in here
[1:05:17] amen y'all know the prophet talked about
[1:05:19] how he wanted to go home and preach that
[1:05:20] that sermon the chur of the serpent I I
[1:05:23] you may call me crazy but I believe he
[1:05:25] has been throughout all these messages
[1:05:27] he's been preaching that trail of the
[1:05:29] serpent he he showed you he showed you
[1:05:31] how the Revival would produce twins and
[1:05:34] he showed you Cain in the beginning and
[1:05:36] and going bring him all the way through
[1:05:38] amen Nimrod and the Tower of Babylon all
[1:05:41] of these different things amen the
[1:05:43] prophet I believe without taking a
[1:05:45] sermon and preaching to us that trail of
[1:05:48] the serpent he had been preaching the
[1:05:49] tra of the serpent the whole entire time
[1:05:53] constantly exposing the enemy and
[1:05:56] exposing how he works and I'm so glad
[1:05:58] tonight we're not here ignorant of how
[1:06:00] the devil works but we know his devices
[1:06:04] and we know how he works according to
[1:06:07] the message of the hour amen watch that
[1:06:10] serpent there in the Garden of Eden he
[1:06:12] comes to Adam and Eve or he comes to Eve
[1:06:14] there and begins to influence her begins
[1:06:16] to tell her well you know I I I don't
[1:06:19] think it's too big of a deal if you do
[1:06:21] this or if you just take a amen if if
[1:06:24] you just disobey the word of God just a
[1:06:26] little bit it's not that big of a deal
[1:06:28] what is he trying to do he's trying to
[1:06:30] break confidence in the word of God she
[1:06:34] should have always stayed right with
[1:06:35] that word is that right she should have
[1:06:38] always kept close to that word she
[1:06:40] should have always said you know what
[1:06:41] God Said the day I eat thereof that day
[1:06:44] I shall surely die and what the devil
[1:06:47] say one word he said Thou shalt not
[1:06:49] surely
[1:06:51] die and just one word threw her amen
[1:06:54] threw her into depression thre her into
[1:06:57] death through her into sadness so don't
[1:06:59] think we can get by with just something
[1:07:01] really small we know the Bible teaches
[1:07:04] us it's the little foxes that spoil the
[1:07:06] vine it was just a little variation from
[1:07:09] that word and the victory was out of
[1:07:12] their lives and Revival was out of their
[1:07:14] lives listen friends to get off the word
[1:07:17] in one ioda is to get off the word in
[1:07:20] its entirety but listen this bride will
[1:07:23] not be a bride that is off of the word
[1:07:26] she will be a bride that's in the middle
[1:07:28] of the road and she will be a bride that
[1:07:31] is obeying every single word of God
[1:07:34] listen friends the devil was a good
[1:07:36] preacher he was a powerful preacher and
[1:07:39] he had a lot of influence and he came to
[1:07:41] Eve and one over her
[1:07:43] trust is that right she said hey I've
[1:07:45] gotten a man from the Lord amen she amen
[1:07:48] her trust have been amen uh gained by
[1:07:51] the serpent there listen friends that's
[1:07:53] exactly what the devil wants to do to
[1:07:55] you and I he wants you to give a little
[1:07:57] ear under his lie he wants you to give a
[1:08:00] little ear under his reasoning that's
[1:08:03] exactly the devil for you just give a
[1:08:05] little ear unto reasoning give a little
[1:08:08] ear unto an opinion about the message or
[1:08:11] an opinion about the word that's exactly
[1:08:14] what the devil wants to do but listen
[1:08:16] friends I'm so glad there's been a word
[1:08:18] of Prophecy that has been spoken over

[1:08:23] Prophecy amen the prophet of God
[1:08:26] prophesied over this bride and said how
[1:08:29] that first Eve she had the capacity to
[1:08:32] fail but the second Eve in this end time
[1:08:36] he says she cannot fail she is made in
[1:08:40] such a way that she's not able to fail

[1:09:14] put on you you are made with the ability
[1:09:17] to not be able to

[1:10:03] bride but you don't have partial word
[1:10:06] today you've got perfect word and it
[1:10:09] will cause a Perfect

[1:10:25] you to be influenced by Jesus Christ and
[1:10:28] his word he said he is the word amen

[1:11:45] the prophet preached that message
[1:11:46] influence seven times amen one time he
[1:11:49] would title it their influence of
[1:11:50] another I thought that was amazing by
[1:11:52] the way seven times the prophets
[1:11:54] speaking on influence I thought on that
[1:11:56] you know amen it's a perfect influence
[1:11:58] and that's what God is looking for he's
[1:12:00] looking for somebody that will be
[1:12:02] perfectly influenced by the word because
[1:12:06] God's looking for a Perfect Bride is he
[1:12:08] not he's looking for a Perfect Bride and
[1:12:10] the only way God will have a perfect
[1:12:12] bride is if she comes under perfect
[1:12:15] influence of the perfect word which is
[1:12:18] the message of the hour am me listen I
[1:12:21] make no apology for that th this message
[1:12:24] is a per perfect message this message is
[1:12:27] a a message of perfection he said you
[1:12:30] you're making William Brandon God you're
[1:12:32] making him perfect to the blood he was
[1:12:34] perfect I understand he had fought some
[1:12:36] failures but this message is a perfect
[1:12:39] message and it will produce perfect
[1:12:42] results every time I think it's time you
[1:12:45] try amen why don't you just try it for a
[1:12:48] minute why don't you why don't you be
[1:12:50] influenced by the tapes and be
[1:12:52] influenced by the message I'll tell you
[1:12:54] this it will change your home it will
[1:12:57] change the atmosphere in your home and
[1:12:59] you will let it influence
[1:13:02] you that's exactly right I tell you this

[1:20:13] hands that's exactly right why do you
[1:20:16] think the devil surrounding Jesus and

[1:21:01] trying to break confidence in Christ so
[1:21:04] re realize this friends if the devil can
[1:21:06] break confidence in the word the the the

[1:23:56] gave them a message of action I've just

[1:24:01] the prophet talked about Isaiah and he
[1:24:02] talked about them cherubims that was
[1:24:04] around the throne he said them cherubims
[1:24:06] had they or them serams rather the the

[1:24:13] their feet he said what was it it was
[1:24:15] shity and reverence he said and those
[1:24:18] angels were flying around the throne he
[1:24:21] said they was in a state of action and
[1:24:24] the prophet said that's what the church
[1:24:26] ought to be we ought to be clothed in
[1:24:28] humility and clothed and reverence and
[1:24:31] we ought to be about the father's
[1:24:33] business and we ought to be in a state
[1:24:35] of as listen I can show you as the
[1:24:38] prophet said where God started a book of
[1:24:41] Acts church and you show me where God
[1:24:44] ever stopped
[1:24:45] it is that right amen how many believes
[1:24:48] our Prophet was under the influence of
[1:24:50] the word amen how many folks in here
[1:24:52] believe that he was under the influence
[1:24:54] of this word amen we'll just keep on
[1:24:57] going a little bit deeper amen he was
[1:24:59] under the influence of the perfect word
[1:25:02] amen you look at him up there on
[1:25:03] Colorado Hill as that storm is up there
[1:25:06] and fixing the cover over the mountain

[1:25:10] amen you speak unto it and it'll be what
[1:25:13] you say is that right amen you speak
[1:25:16] unto it and it'll be what you say and
[1:25:18] the prophet is there and he told that
[1:25:20] storm he said you go away for three days
[1:25:24] that's exactly right you go away for 3
[1:25:27] Days amen and and exactly what the

[1:25:43] just in one man I don't believe the
[1:25:46] power to speak the word and God perform
[1:25:49] it was just for the prophet but I
[1:25:52] believe if we'll get influenced by the
[1:25:54] same word that the prophet influence
[1:25:58] brother you will speak over that storm
[1:26:01] and you will speak over cancer and
[1:26:03] you'll speak over any demon power that

[1:26:09] God that did it for the prophet is the
[1:26:12] same God that will do it for the
[1:26:18] bride that's exactly the truth if it
[1:26:21] influenced the prophet in such a way
[1:26:23] that he's here speaking a squirrel into
[1:26:27] existence you give me one place where
[1:26:29] the Prophet ever said that's just for me

[1:30:37] this word how many is thankful for the
[1:30:40] influence of this message amen how
[1:30:42] many's thankful that God has restored
[1:30:45] the influence back to the Church of the
[1:30:47] Living God brother we we used to think
[1:30:49] it was just Pentecostal to to lift up
[1:30:52] our hands and the worship God and to
[1:30:54] shout his Praises we we used to put away
[1:30:57] amen and the prophet put all that stuff
[1:30:59] in its balance is that right he never
[1:31:02] pushed us to do it he said you just be
[1:31:03] who you are amen all things have been
[1:31:06] restored in their proper place and the
[1:31:09] influence has been
[1:31:11] restored that's exactly right amen all
[1:31:15] the influence has been restored
[1:31:16] sometimes God does things to influence
[1:31:18] our faith you believe that and mean God
[1:31:21] speaks a word over our life to influence
[1:31:23] our faith to influence our life we know
[1:31:26] the prophet is there and many times in
[1:31:27] the sermon people would come up to him
[1:31:29] and he' begin to discern now he would
[1:31:31] say now sir you've got more faith than
[1:31:33] you thought you had he said you was
[1:31:35] unconscious of it and then the prophet
[1:31:37] would go back into their life this
[1:31:39] Messiah sign perfectly he would go back
[1:31:41] into their life and say sir I see you at
[1:31:43] the doctor and this happened and this
[1:31:45] happened you say what's the prophet
[1:31:47] doing when he does that he's trying to
[1:31:49] influence their faith he said sir you've
[1:31:51] already got faith we know it's perfectly
[1:31:53] in the scripture God gives to a man a
[1:31:55] Measure of Faith ain't that right God
[1:31:57] gives to a man a measure of faith God
[1:31:59] has given you Faith but sometimes God
[1:32:02] does things to energize that faith and
[1:32:05] to Quicken that faith and I'll tell
[1:32:07] these men and these sisters here sister
[1:32:10] you've got more faith than you thought
[1:32:11] you had and then he'll go and say sister
[1:32:14] I see a vision and this is going to
[1:32:17] happen and this is going to happen and
[1:32:19] says sister you believe that don't you
[1:32:21] and she says yes I believe that and said
[1:32:24] it's going to happen exactly how you
[1:32:26] believe it what's the prophet doing he's
[1:32:28] influencing the faith of that person is
[1:32:32] that right he'll tell them a vision and
[1:32:34] it will so influence their faith that it
[1:32:37] will cause such a victory to come over
[1:32:39] their lives and they would leave that
[1:32:42] church service never the same person now
[1:32:44] and you all know that testimony brother
[1:32:46] where I'm told about sister Georgie
[1:32:47] Carter amen I'm sure many of you know
[1:32:49] that testimony but the sister there I
[1:32:51] believe had been uh raped by her uncle
[1:32:54] or something along those lines and she
[1:32:55] got this infection in her body and she
[1:32:58] began to lose all this weight and then
[1:32:59] she amen became just bedridden and
[1:33:02] sister George is there bed written and
[1:33:04] there amen she's there amen believing in
[1:33:07] Divine Healing and believing that God is
[1:33:09] able to raise her up and her family's a
[1:33:11] bunch of
[1:33:12] unbelievers said God don't do that no
[1:33:14] more God don't heal that no more and
[1:33:17] they were actually praying by the way
[1:33:19] they they were actually praying God keep
[1:33:20] these preachers away from our daughter
[1:33:23] they're giving her false hope and giving
[1:33:25] her false belief and and giving her but
[1:33:27] there was something in Sister Georgie
[1:33:29] that she believed that God was a Jehovah
[1:33:31] of Miracles she believed that God could
[1:33:34] still raise you up from a death bed and
[1:33:37] she believed that with all of her heart
[1:33:39] amen she had heard of the brandom
[1:33:41] campaigns and heard about what God had
[1:33:43] been doing and and people coming off the
[1:33:45] stretchers and coming out of wheelchairs
[1:33:47] and she believed that with all of her
[1:33:49] heart amen and the prophets there
[1:33:51] praying about going to pray for sister
[1:33:53] Georgie and we know the prophet goes
[1:33:55] there and he's there in the woods and
[1:33:56] he's praying and trying to find the will
[1:33:58] of
[1:33:59] God it's so beautiful he's praying and
[1:34:02] trying to find the will of God and the
[1:34:05] Lord shows him a vision of sister
[1:34:07] Georgie and she's up and she's walking
[1:34:10] and and she's there perfectly healed and
[1:34:13] then the prophet goes there and
[1:34:15] meanwhile God is dealing with sister
[1:34:17] George and she's here in a amen a vision
[1:34:20] or a dream or something along those
[1:34:22] lines and what she sees she sees the
[1:34:23] Lord Jesus walking to her amen and then
[1:34:26] by that time brother Brandon was
[1:34:28] actually there and he comes up to the
[1:34:30] door and opens the door and where it was
[1:34:33] the Lord Jesus here comes brother brand
[1:34:35] opening the door and comes to her and
[1:34:38] says sister Georgie I want you to know I
[1:34:41] saw a vision Hallelujah I saw a vision
[1:34:45] and in that Vision you was up and you
[1:34:48] was walking what was the prophet doing
[1:34:50] spoken word amen what was the prophet
[1:34:53] doing he was influencing her faith to
[1:34:56] rise to the occasion and said sister
[1:35:00] Georgie I saw you walking and brother
[1:35:04] said out of nowhere Here Comes such an
[1:35:06] anointing down upon her and sister
[1:35:08] Georgie that hadn't been able to walk
[1:35:10] she got up and be to walk but say I
[1:35:14] didn't know how she had strength to do
[1:35:16] it but somehow she received the
[1:35:18] supernatural strength to be able to walk
[1:35:21] and he says Sister George he got up and
[1:35:23] worshiping God and began praising God
[1:35:27] and she went outside and blessed the
[1:35:29] grass and blessed the tree he said
[1:35:31] preacher what are you trying to say that
[1:35:33] that's all good for sister Georgie well
[1:35:35] let me tell you about another Vision
[1:35:37] little bride amen the same prophet he
[1:35:40] had a vision of the preview of the bride
[1:35:43] and she was an Ephesian bride or she was

[1:35:54] preview of another bride and she was a
[1:35:56] worldly bride right and she was walking
[1:35:58] into the step of the world but then

[1:50:03] born we weren't born
[1:50:05] natural we were inside of
[1:50:08] somebody that's right we were in King
[1:50:11] theophany in his
[1:50:13] mind where's he at right now he's not
[1:50:16] called in the grave no he go he's in
[1:50:20] hell he went down to talk to the devil
[1:50:23] that's
[1:50:24] right right and we went with
[1:50:27] him right that's why if we put ourself
[1:50:31] in Christ I've said you many times
[1:50:32] before I put you put yourself in Christ
[1:50:34] you already been to
[1:50:37] Hell you already been to Hell you got
[1:50:39] the Keys of the Kingdom now you got the
[1:50:41] king keys to the devil's house if you're
[1:50:44] in that same theophany that he was he
[1:50:45] wasn't in flesh he was in theophany amen
[1:50:49] went to
[1:50:50] hell that's right winess to the devil
[1:50:53] yes sir ain't that what we just did
[1:50:55] tonight witness to the devil that we're
[1:50:58] Gods little Gods we were inside that man
[1:51:01] and then he came up and when he remember
[1:51:03] when he resurrected we
[1:51:05] resurrected you believe that you believe
[1:51:08] that absolutely so you ain't got to go
[1:51:10] to hell no more you already been one
[1:51:11] time you ain't got to go twice you just
[1:51:13] got to go one time that's it so we
[1:51:14] already been to Hell we know what it's
[1:51:16] like down there and it's not hot cuz
[1:51:18] Jesus was down there it didn't bother
[1:51:19] him n it didn't bother him at all but
[1:51:21] you know what he did he come back back
[1:51:22] up and he picked up a group of
[1:51:24] people right he picked up a group of
[1:51:27] people and he opened the door and I love
[1:51:28] brother R could only one could tell a
[1:51:30] story like that opened the door and said
[1:51:32] said he knocked on the door and said
[1:51:33] Abraham opened the door said Sarah
[1:51:36] that's the man we fed a calf to that's
[1:51:38] right said Ezekiel was looking over his
[1:51:39] shoulder said that's a wheel and a m the
[1:51:42] wheel and they all knew him in the
[1:51:44] Revelation that they had but he was a
[1:51:46] man standing there in theophany that was
[1:51:50] Jesus that we got inside out of us
[1:51:54] tonight all right it's say 52 I ain't
[1:51:58] preaching amen but it just it just gives
[1:52:01] you it just gives us hope that's right
[1:52:04] and and Faith to know that that all
[1:52:07] that's already been
[1:52:08] done oh that's already been done like
[1:52:10] you said you know he saw hell brother
[1:52:12] Brown did he saw hell thank God he
[1:52:14] didn't see us there that's right right
[1:52:17] he saw his converts in The Other Place
[1:52:20] amen his converts were in The Other
[1:52:22] Place converts weren't in Hell amen amen
[1:52:25] so that's that's that's my whole I I
[1:52:28] don't put my faith on brother
[1:52:30] brandham I put my faith on what he
[1:52:32] preached to me that I can see amen cuz
[1:52:35] if I can see it I'm looking through the
[1:52:38] same eyes if he called us little
[1:52:40] Messiahs yes sir I've always believed
[1:52:43] this he didn't take it with him that
[1:52:45] prophetic brother R said it would take a
[1:52:46] prophetic people to understand this
[1:52:50] messag so where's what
[1:52:53] prophetic
[1:52:56] Prophet there's a prophet in there
[1:52:58] somewhere so there's a prophetic group
[1:53:00] of people and I believe they're standing
[1:53:01] here receiving the message as you said
[1:53:04] receiving it by the influence listen the
[1:53:06] world influences us enough out here
[1:53:08] that's right but we've already won if
[1:53:12] you'll just believe that we're sitting
[1:53:14] in Heavenly places our soul is in
[1:53:17] another dimension yes sir it's faster
[1:53:19] than whatever your Mom and Daddy brought
[1:53:21] to the earth I promise you that cuz this
[1:53:22] part till here but we're in Heavenly
[1:53:24] places brother Ram said he said that's
[1:53:26] the believer's position yes sir he
[1:53:29] didn't say the unbelievers he said the
[1:53:31] believer's position in Christ yes sir so
[1:53:35] we've been resurrected already we just
[1:53:37] like you said this is got to catch up
[1:53:39] with it amen my dad preached a sermon
[1:53:41] many many years ago called matching
[1:53:43] pieces he said what matches God's mind
[1:53:45] what it matches down here what was in
[1:53:46] his
[1:53:47] mind we're gone so we're heading toward
[1:53:51] that matching part we match we're going
[1:53:53] there nothing will stop it cuz he's
[1:53:55] already seen it and we believe in this
[1:53:57] church that God does not make a mistake

[1:54:02] know if y'all believe in your church but
[1:54:03] I have to stop every once while y'all
