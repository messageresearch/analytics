[20:31] weeks ago and they cremated the body so
[20:33] we're gonna have a per her wishes a
[20:36] memorial service on November the 11th so
[20:39] now we got all those out of the way left
[20:41] turn revelations 10:1 and today we're
[20:43] going to recap and have comments because
[20:47] when you get into the to the groove of
[20:49] this it's like brother Dale said you you
[20:52] brother Ryan read it this morning
[20:53] actually brother Branham stated he would
[20:57] go sit down next to a tree and said he
[21:00] would just meditate remember he'd go
[21:04] squirrel hunting but he actually took
[21:05] the pencil in a piece of paper he'd sat
[21:07] down beside a tree he said now when a
[21:09] revelation would come something from God
[21:11] would come 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 2 is 4
[21:14] but what it was it wasn't that he was
[21:16] adding 2 times 2 is 4
[21:17] he was it comes in a sequence it comes
[21:20] to 2 times 2 is 4
[21:21] 2 times 2 is 4 2 times then and it
[21:23] really flows but some times 2 times 2
[21:25] don't always equal 4 when you're trying
[21:28] you gotta bump up against the wall so
[21:30] this week I was been bumping up against
[21:32] the wall trying to get to Revelation
[21:34] chapter 5 but knowing that maybe we had
[21:37] some visitors with us that we needed to
[21:38] back out so brother direct this is for
[21:40] you the rest of you can sleep you and
[21:42] your family can pay attention to this
[21:44] and well but no and that's the way the
[21:46] Lord works the Lord's not going to take
[21:49] off and not give you a chance to catch
[21:53] up
[21:54] hey man he's just not because he's just
[21:57] a good guy he's a good god that will us
[21:59] like said remember the the 90 and 9 he
[22:02] left in the fold just to go get the 1
[22:04] ma'am alright so he went out to get the
[22:06] 1 and then we're going to back up today
[22:09] and just Greek out have some comments at
[22:12] the end and then next Sunday will the
[22:13] Lord willing we'll start with Revelation
[22:15] chapter 5
[22:15] so revelations chapter 10 verse 1 let's
[22:19] pray before we get started the Heavenly
[22:21] Father we pray Lord that you would be
[22:24] with us today in our speech and our
[22:27] hearing Lord and all the things that go
[22:29] on we've sang the songs of Zion we've
[22:32] prayed we took up the offering done all
[22:35] the peripheral things that we're
[22:37] supposed to do when we come to service
[22:39] and now comes time lord
[22:40] for your word we pray that you'll do the
[22:42] speaking Lord you do the hearing you do
[22:44] the only one that can do the revealing
[22:46] because man cannot reveal this it has to
[22:48] be by the Holy Spirit
[22:50] father we pray that you would be with
[22:51] the ones that are not here all the ones
[22:53] that are it brother Tim hymns for the
[22:54] meeting they're on their way back now
[22:56] Lord we pray that you keep them safe
[22:57] bring them back Lord together in one in
[23:01] you here in the church Lord bless the
[23:04] ones that are with us today father the
[23:06] ones that are in the foreign fields we
[23:08] pray that you just be with those
[23:10] missionaries give them a fruit for their
[23:12] labor father we always think about them
[23:14] over there doing their work doing their
[23:15] job we pray that you'd give them fruit
[23:18] Lord for their labor father forgive us
[23:20] of our sins and our many mistakes that
[23:21] we make be with us and the further of
[23:24] this service Lord we give you the praise
[23:27] and honor and glory for all these things
[23:28] Lord cuz without you or nothing Jesus
[23:30] name we pray amen revelations 10 verse 1
[23:33] we'll put the chart up in a minute
[23:35] and what I'll do is I'll give us some
[23:37] bullet points two points to ponder
[23:40] before we step over into Revelation
[23:43] chapter 5 because when we go over into
[23:45] revelation chapter 5 I want us to
[23:47] realize that we're going to have to call
[23:50] on a lot of things that we've heard over
[23:52] the years you're gonna have to call that
[23:55] up and you're gonna have to to bring it
[23:57] in and you're going to have to chew on
[24:01] it like like the brother was saying this
[24:04] morning you know you're just gonna have
[24:06] to chew on it you're gonna have to be
[24:07] like a cow that chews on that you know
[24:09] he he eats and he eats and he eats and
[24:11] then brother Larry he goes and lays down
[24:12] under the tree and regurgitate sitting
[24:15] he eats it again last way he's made well
[24:18] that's the way we should be made because
[24:19] we should be able to bring it back up to
[24:21] our remembrance the prophet of God told
[24:23] us that if we would make ourselves
[24:25] available that God will speak to us all
[24:27] right so revelations 10 verse 1 we're
[24:29] going to try to work into the seven
[24:32] seals for the next few months and we'll
[24:36] get to the first seal eventually but we
[24:37] got to have a good foundation because
[24:39] we've been here 50 something years since
[24:41] the seals have been open the greatest
[24:43] message the prophet of God said he he
[24:45] had ever if anything was inspired he
[24:48] said those seals were inspired
[24:49] we know his whole message was inspired
[24:51] but those seals was what his message
[24:54] was all about they meant cuz we're gonna
[24:56] read it and prove it to you in just a
[24:57] few minutes cuz I think maybe most of
[24:59] the church world II and I say Church
[25:01] world most of the church world of
[25:02] message just means that the seals were
[25:04] open and that was it but there is
[25:06] something else because that was to be
[25:09] for the redemption of our body to get us
[25:11] out of here the third pull the headstone
[25:13] all those great things to get our body
[25:15] changed and get us out of here because
[25:17] we're not leaving here without a body
[25:19] change we're not leaving here you're
[25:22] gonna die and go by the grave yeah but
[25:24] when you come up your body is gonna be
[25:25] changed
[25:26] alright I'm telling you but like the new
[25:29] ones I'm not looking for a rapture I'm
[25:32] not looking for a rapture they're
[25:33] actually the wraps are started on the
[25:35] day of Pentecost
[25:36] but the culmination but will be one day
[25:39] of a sequence of events like going to
[25:42] school you go to school for 12 years you
[25:44] get a diploma the diplomas the rapture
[25:47] what's the most important the diploma
[25:49] are the twelve years of school well
[25:51] you're not going to get that diploma
[25:52] without 12 years of school okay so the
[25:55] twelve years of school is the most
[25:57] important the most important is getting
[25:59] us to the place because there can't be a
[26:01] rapture without the voice of the
[26:02] Resurrection without what that same man
[26:06] here in Bride form with a loud voice
[26:09] that brought Lazarus the same voice the
[26:13] Prophet said that brought Lazarus from
[26:14] the grave well what bring those saints
[26:17] from Paul's age all the way up so
[26:19] they're waiting on you and I amen
[26:22] alright revelations 10 verse 1 I saw
[26:24] another mighty angel come down from
[26:26] heaven clothed with the cloud the
[26:27] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[26:29] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[26:31] pillars of fire he had it in his hand a
[26:33] little book open and he said his right
[26:35] foot upon the sea and his left foot upon
[26:37] the earth and cried with a loud voice as
[26:39] when a lion roars and when he had cried
[26:41] watched seven thunders uttered their
[26:43] voices now man has made the thunders
[26:46] many things but we're going to prove
[26:47] what they are maybe during this not this
[26:50] service but during this series of
[26:51] services because some people thinks it's
[26:54] seven people and they're about all dead
[26:56] so it's not them God doesn't use a dead
[26:58] message he uses the live person to bring
[27:01] his message why seek ye the living among
[27:05] the dead all right
[27:07] the resurrection had to be sounded by
[27:09] someone that is alive and when the seven
[27:13] thunders had uttered their voices I was
[27:15] about to write remember John was
[27:16] commissioned to write what he saw and I
[27:18] heard a voice from heaven saying unto me
[27:20] seal up those things which the seven
[27:22] thunders uttered and write them not in
[27:25] other words John was getting ready to
[27:26] write them so he wasn't afraid to write
[27:30] what he saw so it wasn't something
[27:32] unfamiliar to John okay
[27:36] and the angel which i saw stand upon the
[27:40] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[27:41] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[27:43] liveth forever and it liveth for ever
[27:44] and ever who created heaven and the
[27:47] things that therein are in the earth and
[27:49] the things that therein are and the sea
[27:50] and the things which are therein that
[27:52] there should be time no longer but in
[27:55] the days of the voice of the seventh
[27:56] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[27:59] mystery of God should be finished as he
[28:01] hath declared to his servants the
[28:04] prophets and you may be seated in the
[28:05] Lord at his blessing to the reading of
[28:07] the word and I'm not leaving I'm just
[28:08] going back in here to get my brother Ram
[28:15] said we could we'd read one Scripture
[28:16] and go home so we're not doing do that
[28:18] today but there was a brother who
[28:22] listens in from Michigan he he's the one
[28:26] that sent us a gracious donation the
[28:29] other day and he he called me the other
[28:31] day and I know he's watching so brother

[29:00] I reached and grabbed it and when I
[29:02] pulled it they was that much left
[29:04] [Laughter]
[29:06] it was down to the variance she said I
[29:09] just knew that they was a few a few
[29:13] turns left but no there was that much so
[29:17] she gave me a big role today so maybe
[29:18] this thing won't fall apart but he told
[29:20] me he said why don't you take some of
[29:22] that money I sent you and buy you an
[29:23] easel so I guess I will go buy an easel
[29:30] cuz I like to do it visually cuz visual

[29:37] you can kind of burn it in your brain
[29:40] and bring it up and talk about later on
[29:48] alright there be okay say Amen all right

[29:54] this and help the ones maybe that hadn't
[29:59] been here for a while
[30:01] call I like for everybody to see see
[30:04] means to understand right so now let's
[30:07] pull the first quote the first few
[30:08] quotes are going to be quotes that we
[30:10] have quoted before but I kind of
[30:12] condensed them and made just small
[30:14] little snippets of it but you know what
[30:15] you can go back and read it if you want
[30:18] to read the rest of it the layout of
[30:19] sand church age number one church age
[30:21] book now this messenger of my life 94
[30:25] and revelations 10 7 is going to do two
[30:27] things one according to Malachi 4 he
[30:31] will turn the hearts of the children to
[30:32] the father's 2 he will reveal the
[30:36] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[30:38] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[30:41] contained in the seven seals see how
[30:44] he's saying it now contained in the
[30:45] seven seals it will be these divinely
[30:47] revealed mystery truths that literally
[30:51] turn the hearts of the children to the
[30:52] Pentecostal fathers exactly so but
[30:54] consider this this prophet messenger
[30:56] will be in his nature and manner as were
[30:58] elijah and join the people of this
[31:00] prophet messengers day will be as they
[31:02] were at Ahab's day and gone and since
[31:04] then it is only the children whose
[31:06] hearts will be turned it is only the
[31:08] children who will listen all right so
[31:11] it's going to be the only going to be
[31:12] the children not just the children in
[31:14] age as far as human age but the what
[31:18] he's going to turn
[31:19] hearts of the children so they're the
[31:22] ones that's going to list them the
[31:23] children back to the faith of the
[31:25] Pentecostal fathers and then what we're
[31:27] going to grow in grace and knowledge
[31:29] together amen
[31:31] so this messenger then I want to make a
[31:34] few points I found a real good quote and
[31:37] I may read it if I have time about
[31:39] something we've been studying on and it
[31:41] just kind of puts a a punctuation mark
[31:45] all right the first point we want to
[31:48] make is is whoever this messenger is
[31:51] that we're listening to or watching has
[31:55] a two-part message is that Alright - he
[31:59] just said that I'm just reading what he
[32:01] said it's in two parts so you we have a
[32:04] two part message not two different parts
[32:10] as per say two different people are two
[32:13] different ideas or two different
[32:14] mindsets one message but there's two
[32:17] parts in that message one is what to
[32:20] turn the hearts of the children back to
[32:21] the Pentecostal father's the faith of
[32:24] the fathers and then reveal the
[32:27] mysteries of what the seven thunders now
[32:31] I want you to watch how he how he said
[32:33] that he didn't say reveal the mystery of
[32:36] the seven seals which is in Revelations
[32:38] 10 which of the revelation is contained
[32:40] in the seven thunders he didn't say that
[32:42] he said he said well he will reveal the
[32:45] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[32:47] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[32:50] contained in the seven seals that all
[32:53] right and then he will reveal those
[32:56] mysteries that are in the seven thunders
[33:00] mm all right okay because we don't get
[33:05] into something because remember for
[33:06] those of you hadn't been here for a
[33:08] while this is the way the scroll looked
[33:13] alright it wasn't a book the seven
[33:18] sealed book of redemption didn't look
[33:20] like this now I got a quote where
[33:22] brother Branham said only about five or
[33:26] six hundred years ago did they start
[33:27] making books like this all of your books
[33:30] then the old in the old testament the
[33:32] old scrolls were
[33:33] look like this what was written was
[33:35] inside here this is the seven seals you
[33:39] can take seven of these or one make one
[33:41] this is the seal right this is the seal
[33:49] this is what had it sealed up there's a
[33:53] mystery there sure but that's something
[33:55] different from this it's actually a good
[34:00] quote in there
[34:01] but that's what the mysteries contained
[34:05] in the seven seals which were the
[34:08] thunders of the voice of God and many
[34:10] times I think that we've taken this the
[34:13] mystery of the seal and went with it
[34:16] when this is what had it locked this is
[34:21] what had it locked so man couldn't see
[34:23] it sure this was the white horse rider
[34:26] which was the Antichrist that man said
[34:29] was the Holy Ghost property God what
[34:33] breaks the seal gives us the revelation
[34:37] but there's still a mystery there's
[34:40] still something written in the book
[34:43] because the seals had the book sealed
[34:47] that all writes amen
[34:49] cuz remember if he's got two parts to do
[34:53] then there should be two parts of this
[34:56] the breaking of the seal and the mystery
[35:00] of the thunders I got some I got some
[35:02] water thank you John and watch now
[35:08] number two we were we were going through
[35:10] this on questions and answers on the
[35:12] seals and like I said again to
[35:15] background everything that we've been
[35:16] talking about so this is a two-part
[35:19] message now the second thing I want to
[35:21] talk about is when he come up to the
[35:23] questions and answers on the seals but
[35:25] he told him he said now pull it up on
[35:28] screen
[35:40] make sure I see you're doing that
[35:42] where's my quote oh it's Kern what
[35:51] number two we're okay we're working here
[35:58] that okay we're working we're at working
[36:00] progress that's okay
[36:01] thank you brother Kern conscious lost
[36:03] his mind he's gonna be a dead end he's
[36:05] already lost don't try to make yourself
[36:08] odd to be a Christian because you see it
[36:10] you take yourself away from God and you
[36:12] if you can understand that this is that
[36:14] third Pole you should have caught that
[36:16] the other day now remember they didn't
[36:19] because watch you remember there'll be
[36:22] no impersonation like there was the
[36:24] other two see so that's as far as you
[36:26] know you should know now just just
[36:28] remember that you see now there's
[36:30] something taking place in this room
[36:32] there's something here there's actually
[36:34] in this room angels voice of God but how
[36:37] do you you can't if you can't hear the
[36:39] natural voice without something to send
[36:41] it out how are you going to hear the
[36:42] spiritual voice now you might make
[36:45] believe that somebody is singing this
[36:47] certain song that might not even be
[36:49] there but when it actually strikes the
[36:51] crystal that it's supposed to strike
[36:53] then it gives a true interpretation and
[36:56] vindicates it by showing the picture see
[37:00] what I mean now then number two is that
[37:04] it must be for a special group of people
[37:10] it was not for them remember he said
[37:13] this is not for you you're not here
[37:15] you're not even going to get this it's
[37:17] not for you it's gone from you amen
[37:21] so there must not be somebody that was
[37:24] sitting in that congregation that was in
[37:26] tune with what was coming than alright
[37:30] because it's for another group it's for
[37:33] someone else is for a special group of
[37:35] people what one that was what we were
[37:38] talking about in tune now what were we
[37:42] talking about the crystal he just said
[37:44] he says when what he said when it
[37:46] strikes the crystal and all of you know
[37:50] that
[37:50] that you're old enough to know some of
[37:53] you kids will look cross-eyed at this
[37:55] but there used to be little diamond
[37:57] crystals inside of a radio we've turned
[38:00] into the digital age and it's not there
[38:02] anymore it's all circuit boards and all
[38:03] that but when I was growing up you had a
[38:06] m55 and you had a m-715 you had just
[38:09] 1260 and that's about it where there was
[38:12] a certain crystal in there and that
[38:14] crystal come from the radio station and
[38:17] that radio station had a certain tune to
[38:21] it and you couldn't pick up a m55 when
[38:26] your dial was at 750 you picked up a m
[38:30] 750 because that's what that crystal
[38:33] said when you turned it that dial to
[38:35] where it was supposed to be that's what
[38:37] you picked up exactly what was coming so
[38:41] there was a special group of people
[38:42] coming there was a group sitting there
[38:45] that know by no means are we d
[38:47] Christianizing anyone but there in 1963
[38:49] they didn't have a clue what he was
[38:51] talking about ask me questions just on
[38:57] the seals and they asked him about
[38:59] wearing pantyhose and pajamas to listen
[39:05] he didn't need a revelation all the
[39:07] other news read the questions knowing
[39:09] they wasn't getting what he was talking
[39:10] about but he said it's not for you it's
[39:14] gone from you but right around the
[39:17] coming of the Lord bringing in another
[39:19] quote this these things are going to be
[39:21] made known so they weren't for that
[39:23] group of people it was only for a group
[39:25] of people that was in tune arm we'll get
[39:30] to this in a minute
[39:32] pressurized this group that I'm talking
[39:38] about is the only group that's
[39:39] pressurized to take what's coming most
[39:44] others will not take what's coming it's
[39:48] not for them but this two-part message
[39:54] is for a group of people that get both
[39:57] sides not just one than all right
[40:04] you look quiet today but that's okay you
[40:06] can listen if you say man if every once
[40:10] in a while it keep you awake maybe but
[40:14] now look what we're talking about is is
[40:17] we're talking about a message that the
[40:19] Prophet said I have never worked in this
[40:21] realm I have never worked in this in
[40:25] other words in this much anointing I
[40:27] have never worked in my life seen
[40:30] thousands of people healed seen hundreds
[40:32] of people receive instant healing he's
[40:35] seen probably hundreds of thousands
[40:37] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[40:41] many raised from the dead many great
[40:45] things even even speaking the third pole
[40:49] even before this time because remember
[40:53] the the squirrels and all that was but
[40:55] in 59 and 60 so he he had already been
[40:58] through that he had already experienced
[41:00] this and he said now working the room
[41:02] I've never worked before and then we're
[41:04] supposed to stay here and go boy it was
[41:05] a good message that's what they were
[41:09] saying in 1963 that's why he said they
[41:11] weren't getting it cuz they were sitting
[41:13] there going God send a prophet and
[41:18] that's okay that's the foundation that's
[41:22] something to work with but he told him
[41:25] they weren't getting and told them it
[41:27] was gone from him that they were not
[41:29] gonna get it the old ones had to go
[41:39] because they weren't in another age they
[41:43] were in in that Pentecostal age with the
[41:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[41:49] not false they received the baptism of
[41:53] the Holy Ghost they lived a good clean
[41:56] life listen brother branham I'm telling
[41:58] you again he did not come to bring us a
[42:00] good life these people live the life
[42:06] before he got here so he didn't come
[42:10] sure he had to bring that because what
[42:13] that was two loose ends man he said it's
[42:15] okay to cut your hair man instead
[42:16] okay god never said it but man said it
[42:19] was okay to do this man said it was okay
[42:22] father son Holy Ghost baptism it was
[42:24] okay to do this but he he lined that
[42:27] back up but that's what they had the
[42:29] first church age 2,000 years ago that
[42:36] was the first part of the message for
[42:38] the prophet of God to come on the scene
[42:40] and by the Holy Ghost bring us back to
[42:43] the faith of the father's one true and
[42:46] living God no eternal hell what you
[42:48] didn't happen
[42:48] you didn't have to preach that to Peter
[42:50] Paul they were the ones reaching it amen
[42:54] but they couldn't bring the headstone
[42:56] the headstone was missing and then
[43:02] that's the second part he had to come
[43:04] the first part why I read it in a minute
[43:07] was restoration the first part was to
[43:11] restore the gift to restore what divine
[43:15] healing sure to restore Lord Jesus
[43:19] Christ baptism to restore no eternal
[43:22] hell I was just reading in a few minutes
[43:24] ago eternal security that's when I told
[43:27] you I really like that I know if I got
[43:30] the baptism of the Holy Ghost today if
[43:32] I'm born again I'll never have to stand
[43:34] judgment that just blesses my soul buddy
[43:38] let me tell you because other
[43:40] denominations go well we all gotta stand
[43:43] judgment no we don't we've passed that
[43:50] we pass from death unto wine why we've
[43:54] been pressurized to take what's coming
[43:57] we've been in tuned to take what's
[43:59] coming we are a special group of people
[44:02] I'm supposed to be teaching they're not
[44:04] preaching so stop it all right here we
[44:06] go watch this number 3 but remember
[44:11] let's go back to number 2 because when
[44:13] it actually starts strikes the crystal
[44:15] that it's supposed to strike
[44:23] right here when it nicely strikes the
[44:27] crystal that is supposed to strike well
[44:29] then that tells me one thing there is a
[44:32] place that it will strike the right
[44:34] crystal the right crystal in the right
[44:37] station will be what lined up in tune
[44:40] and ready in tune and ready to hear what
[44:45] God has already said not something
[44:48] that's coming it's already been said the
[44:52] days of the voice the seventh angel now
[44:55] number three
[44:57] now watch 1961 now we turn quickly
[45:02] because I know there's a baptismal
[45:03] service
[45:04] what is this Seventh Seal book oh what a
[45:06] great thing did you notice how it says
[45:07] here it was seven seals on the back of
[45:10] the book it's something Oh may God help
[45:12] us now and give us courage maybe sooner
[45:14] or later I can get to you get it to you
[45:17] look this is not written in the word
[45:19] it's sealed on the back of the word the
[45:21] book was sealed by the seven seals now
[45:24] look the seven seals are on the outside
[45:26] the book
[45:28] the mystery is on the inside book the
[45:32] thunders is on the inside of the boat
[45:33] just like I told you on the inside the
[45:34] book outside the books are sealed
[45:37] all right now watch the whole mystery of
[45:41] the book is sealed up in these seven
[45:44] seals this is the one of the most
[45:46] greatest chapters Nate on my revelations
[45:49] chapter five this is one of the most
[45:51] greatest chapters in the whole Book of
[45:54] Revelations
[45:55] look I saw him to write him him selling
[45:57] a throne a book written within and
[45:58] written on inside that's what we're
[46:01] reading this morning in the backside
[46:02] sealed with seven seals outside the
[46:04] Bible what the Bible doesn't even say
[46:06] now let's stop right there for a minute
[46:09] you can't bring some other
[46:11] interpretation it see what he's saying
[46:15] this is what he's saying he's saying
[46:16] just like with with one true Living God
[46:20] the whole Bible the whole Bible is built
[46:24] on one true Living God amen but now what
[46:29] is man done took the same Bible and
[46:31] proved the Trinity God never put that in
[46:35] the Bible
[46:36] that never was even in the mind of God
[46:38] he knew that was what was gonna happen
[46:40] but it never was written in the Bible so
[46:46] this is what he's talking about there's
[46:47] not the seven thunders are not written
[46:49] thunder number one thunder number two
[46:51] thunder number three that's what he's
[46:53] saying he's not saying it's not in the
[46:55] book this is outside the Bible what the
[46:58] Bible doesn't even say because we
[47:00] remember what some people took that and
[47:02] said oh brother branham you can write a
[47:05] 24th chapter of Revelation he said it
[47:08] sounded good he said but you can't add
[47:11] one word or you can't take one word I
[47:14] hope amen
[47:16] that's what we're looking at though it's
[47:18] sealed with seven seals the mysteries of
[47:21] God now what is it now notice well man
[47:26] no notice a sail represents a finished
[47:29] product something that has been already
[47:30] tested proven and then sealed we have
[47:33] the earnest of our salvation now by
[47:35] being sealed with the Holy Spirit that
[47:37] is the earnest of our salvation now like
[47:39] I said before I'll tell you for them
[47:42] look for the other one
[47:43] my brother Brown talks about the boxcar
[47:45] you got to put all the stuff in the
[47:47] boxcar just right and then what there's
[47:49] a seal put on it until its destination
[47:52] now watch more important the seal or
[47:53] watch it in the car what's in the what
[47:56] uh what's in the cars more important cuz
[48:00] you put a seal on an empty car but it's
[48:04] not the right kind of seal cuz that
[48:07] thing's proves to seal and say this is
[48:09] not to be open until it reaches its
[48:11] destination because what's inside so you
[48:14] after even putting a line because what's
[48:16] inside is gold silver sixteen elements
[48:23] of the earth actually you and I potash
[48:26] that's what sealed this sealed what then
[48:29] what does God do God at the end of the
[48:31] journey he opens the thing up and he
[48:33] goes how'd this get here it's empty
[48:38] I thought he spoke to me full
[48:42] I thought you supposed to be filled up
[48:44] and then seal fill me up Lord and then
[48:47] seal me our problem is is we go ahead
[48:51] and slamming Oracle's we think we're
[48:53] ready we think we're ready but when God
[48:58] tells us we're ready when we're in tune
[49:00] and we're pressurized we will it will
[49:04] come out if you plant a tomato seed it's
[49:08] going to bring Tomatoes
[49:09] and then that's why you got to plant the
[49:12] right kind of seed so this is one of the
[49:15] greatest chapters in the Bible that were
[49:16] coming up to in Revelation chapter 5
[49:19] he'll say here in the minutes the most
[49:21] sublime scripture in the Bible did you
[49:26] tell me what he said was the most
[49:27] important scripture in the Bible come on
[49:30] should know that you've been here a long
[49:33] time Daniel 9:24 it's the most important
[49:37] scripture in the Bible that revelations
[49:40] 5 is the most sublime scripture and
[49:42] right those are the two scriptures that
[49:44] you have in the Bible amen
[49:47] number four now we find out that this
[49:51] number four we find out that this was
[49:53] sealed with seven seals and each seal
[49:56] was wrapped around as was the revelation
[49:58] came forth look he pulled the seal and
[50:01] undone this and read what the seal said
[50:06] then he undone the next the scroll and
[50:09] read what the seal said undone the next
[50:10] one and pulled it out to see what the
[50:12] seal said and what the revelation was
[50:14] that's exactly what our seven seals that
[50:17] we're going shortly into we trust each
[50:20] seal when it took off the book will be
[50:22] unrolled and look and that will show
[50:24] exactly what's taking place all right so
[50:27] that's what the seals are going to show
[50:30] us exactly what's taking place not
[50:33] pursuing because look we have another
[50:37] point that we'll want to make it say it
[50:40] was hidden now we're listening it was
[50:47] sealed from mankind
[50:53] it was sealed from mankind because
[50:57] there's only a special group of people
[50:59] that's going to understand this do you
[51:02] understand what I'm saying it's not for
[51:05] a generation past us it's not for a
[51:08] generation ahead of us
[51:09] it's for you and I'm telling you Church
[51:12] I didn't bring that one but I brother
[51:13] branham in 1953 he says something's
[51:16] coming to this church I'm telling you
[51:18] today something's coming to this church
[51:20] there's a group of people that's gonna
[51:23] take this thing and start believing it
[51:26] and you know what not just believing
[51:28] that it was for somebody else believe it
[51:31] for yourself
[51:35] cuz you got to make it personal you got
[51:39] to make it personal you got to make it
[51:42] yours you naughty men revelations 5 I'm
[51:46] I am I'm in Revelations 5 I don't know
[51:52] whether you are or not
[51:53] but I know I am I know he and he took
[51:56] that book he took me that alright we'll
[52:00] get into that in Revelations 5 but
[52:02] listen we got to get through this I got
[52:03] 18 quotes I'm like Ryan this morning
[52:05] Ryan had where I had way too many quotes
[52:07] for 30 minutes I promise you that but he
[52:10] got through them now look verse number 5
[52:12] the breach now notice the seven seals
[52:15] holds the mystery of the book until we
[52:18] can see what those seven seals has
[52:20] sealed in look seven seals has sealed in
[52:23] we're only presuming these things
[52:25] now let's going down to the red letters
[52:27] seven seals on the book has the these
[52:29] seven seals has the book sealed see the
[52:32] book is absolutely sealed do you see it
[52:34] the book is absolutely a sealed book
[52:37] until the seven seals is broken it is
[52:40] sealed up with seven seals read there
[52:48] right there
[52:49] now that's different from the seven
[52:51] thunders I just proved it here's the
[52:55] seal here's the Thunder sorry broke it
[53:01] broke the sails are broke
[53:04] this is the seal this is the Thunder
[53:06] it's two things so we got to get the
[53:09] revelation of this to get it off we got
[53:12] to know brother Laird we got to know
[53:14] that it wasn't just the holy ghost it
[53:15] wasn't the holy ghost it was who had it
[53:18] sealed the white horse rider the
[53:20] Antichrist is the one that said no you
[53:23] can't understand that let me let me get
[53:26] you a pope and he'll tell you what's
[53:28] inside the book no it's not private
[53:32] interpretation it's for you and I amen
[53:37] so the seal is a mystery the seal holds
[53:40] the mystery shows how had it hidden so
[53:44] the thunders are different now the
[53:46] thunders are what the Thunder is what
[53:49] the voice of God so we see that now if
[53:51] brother Branham had a two-part message
[53:53] then there's two parts down here number
[53:55] one is the seal number two is the
[53:58] thunders mm you got the seal and you got
[54:06] the thunders that's what the mysteries
[54:08] contained in the seven seals all right
[54:12] that all right say man all right but now
[54:16] what is it what is this look at number
[54:20] six still in the breach paragraph 142
[54:24] wait a minute I'm sorry I'm gonna finish
[54:26] with this go back to leave out right
[54:28] there stop boat currently been alone now
[54:30] that's different from the seven thunders
[54:32] see this is the seven seals on the book
[54:34] and the book will not the seals will not
[54:38] be released until the message of the
[54:41] seventh angel not the first part we talk
[54:48] about the second part now the seals were
[54:52] not revealed until the messenger of the
[54:56] seventh churches began to sound his
[54:59] message and we'll read it in just a
[55:01] minute not in the ears
[55:02] preparation not in the years of the
[55:04] healing campaign no that's the first
[55:07] part the first part was what faith of
[55:09] the fathers what restoring everything
[55:13] back to where it's supposed to be where
[55:15] it had been before number two he's going
[55:19] to what literally take us to the
[55:21] headstone this is not the headstone
[55:30] right the church agents didn't have the
[55:34] headstone remember his head was cut off
[55:36] memory was cut off sure there's a body
[55:40] there there's a body there was a body of
[55:43] believers but the headstone Christ
[55:45] himself was not back in power like he
[55:49] was when he walked ashore to Galilee
[55:52] soon as he died rose ascended came back
[55:58] onto that Pentecost that began the
[56:00] church that began the bride right that
[56:05] began the bride that's his body they
[56:09] died under the revelation of the Son of
[56:13] God upon this rock I'll build my church
[56:16] and then and the gates of Hell will not
[56:18] prevail against it that all right but
[56:22] that's not the headstone the headstone
[56:25] had not come he was rejected I'm I'm
[56:31] quoting your prophet and I'm quoting you
[56:32] the Bible the Bible said the headstone
[56:35] was rejected he had to become the chief
[56:38] of chief Cornerstone to get his starting
[56:40] back again but even when Paul was still
[56:44] alive
[56:45] Paul said grievious wolves are already
[56:48] among us
[56:49] what's grievious wolf false doctrine
[56:53] false doctrine was already among the
[56:55] church turned in what away from the
[56:59] faith of the fathers Peter never taught
[57:01] three God's Peter never taught eternal
[57:04] hell Peter never taught me he never
[57:06] taught in women could cut their hair he
[57:08] never talked to women he never taught
[57:09] that that wasn't even in their
[57:11] vocabulary they didn't even know why
[57:12] denomination was
[57:16] that's why Paul would call it grievious
[57:18] Wolf's not Baptist Methodist
[57:21] Presbyterian pinnacles whatever and
[57:23] listen let me give the one more thought
[57:26] they had their time goes through the
[57:30] church ages the Baptist had their time
[57:31] the Methodist had to chime the
[57:33] presbyterian there'll be a lot of those
[57:35] people in the bride that alright but not
[57:39] now
[57:40] we have moved away from the church ages
[57:43] we have moved away from these things
[57:45] to what now that's different from the
[57:47] seven thunders this is seven seals on
[57:50] the book and the book will not the seals
[57:52] will not be released until the message
[57:54] of the seventh angel so we are presuming
[57:57] but the genuine revelation of God will
[58:00] be made perfect in that sounding and
[58:03] vindicated truth Amen sounding and
[58:08] vindicated truth now that's exactly what
[58:11] the word said the mystery should be
[58:13] finished at that time and this this
[58:16] seven sealed book remember it was closed
[58:18] in Revelation fifth chapter and
[58:20] revelations the tenth chapter it's open
[58:22] that's what we're fishing again - now
[58:23] remember look I want to bring something
[58:25] in here before we go a little bit
[58:27] further if we look at this plan of
[58:32] redemption
[58:37] Satan is Satan is not included in
[58:40] Redemption only the redeemed are only
[58:45] water only the predestinated the prophet
[58:48] of God said are considered in Redemption
[58:51] so how can breaking a seal showing that
[58:54] the seal was a Antichrist spirit that's
[59:00] not redemption Christ revealed it's the
[59:06] plan of redemption
[59:08] listen Satan has a cause and effect in
[59:11] this in the garden it was a cause and
[59:15] it's been in effect all the way down but
[59:18] listen the plan of redemption is what
[59:19] I'm telling you everybody says well the
[59:21] seals reveals the devil
[59:27] I'm gonna read you about nine clothes
[59:30] not today but later on we're brother mom
[59:32] said this is the plan of redemption not
[59:35] the plan of the devil we know what the
[59:38] plan of the devil is to stop the plan of
[59:41] redemption so realizing that the wild
[59:48] horse rider was the Antichrist it's not
[59:50] going to change our body but realizing
[59:53] that that seal has opened and there's
[59:55] something underneath that seal that's
[59:57] going to raise us up to a place that
[59:59] we've never been raised before there's
[1:00:01] your plan of redemption there's where
[1:00:02] your body cause look justification was
[1:00:05] not just taught in this church an angel
[1:00:07] sanctification was not just taught in
[1:00:09] this church aid the baptism my holy
[1:00:13] ghost has been since the day of
[1:00:14] Pentecost so that's not a new doctrine
[1:00:20] but brother Branham came and places him
[1:00:22] right were they supposed to be now who
[1:00:25] in the world ever taught that Judas was
[1:00:30] sanctified it takes it took a prophet to
[1:00:35] tell you that Judas was sanctified
[1:00:37] that's what he said he was sanctified
[1:00:39] remember sanctified is what clean and
[1:00:42] set aside for service but you can turn
[1:00:44] right around and be the devil himself
[1:00:45] because Judas did mm but you can't
[1:00:49] receive the baptism a Holy Ghost and be
[1:00:51] Judas no way you cannot be God and Satan
[1:00:57] in you at the same time in your soul
[1:01:01] that's a mystery that you and I are in
[1:01:05] tune with just like brother Dale was
[1:01:08] talking this morning they a lot of false
[1:01:10] doctrine in this message listen we're
[1:01:12] not gonna go out of here on false
[1:01:13] doctrine it's got to be the genuine
[1:01:17] revelation of God will be made perfect
[1:01:20] in that sounding and vindicated truth
[1:01:24] amen perfect in that sounding and
[1:01:33] vindicated truth now exactly what the
[1:01:36] word says the mysteries will be finished
[1:01:38] at that time now we're
[1:01:39] gonna go and see what the book says
[1:01:42] about how it become open and it's not
[1:01:45] made known until the lamb takes the book
[1:01:48] and breaks the seals and opens the book
[1:01:50] listen you got to break the seal before
[1:01:53] you see what's inside the book the seals
[1:01:56] not the book it seals on the book
[1:02:00] they've Satan sure Satan had a part he
[1:02:02] sealed it
[1:02:04] God didn't God didn't seal he wants to
[1:02:07] reveal but Satan's hid it for all these
[1:02:10] years he's hid the revelation so it's
[1:02:14] not something new how many of you come
[1:02:18] from denominations okay if you come from
[1:02:22] denominations then you read the same
[1:02:23] Bible and baptize them in the name of
[1:02:25] Father Son Holy Ghost right did you
[1:02:28] change the Bible to come into this
[1:02:29] message
[1:02:30] no you just read it with different
[1:02:32] eyesight that's exactly what we're doing
[1:02:34] everything we listened the prophet of
[1:02:36] God said raptured faith lies in these
[1:02:39] tapes and books it just takes you and I
[1:02:45] to hood be in tune and be pressurized
[1:02:50] and then to see what not the plan of the
[1:02:54] devil but the plan of redemption it's
[1:02:59] the plan of redemption is going to get
[1:03:01] us out of here towards the revelation
[1:03:04] contained in those seven seals number
[1:03:08] six the briefs now revealed as the seals
[1:03:14] breaking our release to us then we can
[1:03:17] see what this great plan of the devil is
[1:03:19] oh what'd I miss
[1:03:23] oh it's this great plan of redemption
[1:03:26] you say you're smart le brother
[1:03:28] branham's done that three or four times
[1:03:29] in the sermon you remember and he'll
[1:03:30] read stuff and they'll say oh no that's
[1:03:31] not what is this see what then we can
[1:03:33] see what this great plan of redemption
[1:03:35] is and when and how it's going to be
[1:03:39] done it's all hidden in this book of
[1:03:42] mystery he'll hear it's sealed up with
[1:03:46] seven seals so look the seals are the
[1:03:52] plan of redemption
[1:03:53] the full plan of redemption amen
[1:03:57] the book of redemption listen Redemption
[1:04:00] was over at Calvary redemption was
[1:04:04] actually over for the world ever begun
[1:04:06] but at Calvary the price was paid there
[1:04:10] had to be a kinsman not a not a spirit
[1:04:14] there had to be a kinsman they had to
[1:04:17] look for a kinsman redeemer somebody
[1:04:20] that was the same as us that's why that
[1:04:23] Melchizedek was God Almighty in human
[1:04:25] flesh but he was not your Savior
[1:04:27] no no he couldn't save you in that form
[1:04:30] he was the priest he was not a baby grew
[1:04:35] up become a man that's our brother no
[1:04:40] Cassady was not our brother it was a
[1:04:44] body created step to anybody look now
[1:04:46] that's not the way you can't it's why
[1:04:51] Jesus Christ had to come to way he did
[1:04:53] perfect kinsman redeemer come right down
[1:04:56] the line they even told him he was born
[1:04:58] of fornication he told them he was born
[1:05:00] wrong they thought he was born the way
[1:05:02] we were just a little bit off he was but
[1:05:08] not the way they thought that's all
[1:05:12] right but watch let's go to number
[1:05:17] number seven no no no no what's down six
[1:05:20] sorry I'll mess you up who can break
[1:05:24] down the seven seals got the mysteries
[1:05:27] of God from the foundation of the world
[1:05:28] all sealed up in there and revealed by
[1:05:31] seven different seals that if God
[1:05:34] willing let him let us pull back the
[1:05:36] seals now look pull back the seal look
[1:05:41] down not what we've done in the message
[1:05:44] we pulled the seal off and we're over
[1:05:45] here looking at the seal that's already
[1:05:49] been revealed as soon as he said that
[1:05:53] was the Antichrist and proved it that's
[1:05:55] exactly what it is but we can't do this
[1:05:58] there's a mystery there's something
[1:06:02] written in the book
[1:06:04] that lad had never shined on remember we
[1:06:07] told you about the junior Jackson vision
[1:06:10] he said he whipped the top off and
[1:06:12] looked down and said they was my glass
[1:06:14] somebody's not sitting on the front row
[1:06:15] I give my baptism today but rip the top
[1:06:18] off and what rip the top off and said
[1:06:24] what that was words in there but light
[1:06:28] had never shown you know what the
[1:06:30] greatest book ever written on the face
[1:06:31] of this earth in a dark room is useless
[1:06:37] that was fresh I just got that the
[1:06:41] greatest book put the Bible out in a
[1:06:44] dark room
[1:06:45] ten years later hundred years later
[1:06:47] you're still going but when light shines
[1:06:52] on it when light shines on listen it
[1:06:56] always was there it just took some light
[1:06:59] shining on it for you to see it and man
[1:07:02] that's the way that what brother Brown
[1:07:04] whipped that top off and he didn't say
[1:07:06] words appeared he said there was words
[1:07:07] written he said light shone on it had
[1:07:11] never shone on it before why he was sooo
[1:07:15] but when he broke the seal the light
[1:07:19] shined on the pages and the Bible the
[1:07:23] prophet said became a brand-new book I
[1:07:25] don't know imma hollering today y'all
[1:07:26] keep you awake I guess the whole thing
[1:07:29] here the seven seals got to mission to
[1:07:31] God from the foundational world all
[1:07:33] sealed up in there revealed by several
[1:07:35] different seals that if God willing let
[1:07:39] him let us pull back those seals and
[1:07:41] look down through the book that's a
[1:07:43] capital B so I won't think that's
[1:07:45] Greer's almanac that would be the Bible
[1:07:49] and find out what it's all about
[1:07:53] oh I hope we have a great time there the
[1:07:55] mystery of redemption is sealed until
[1:08:00] this book could not be broken until the
[1:08:03] last angels message the scrolls there we
[1:08:07] knowed it was there we know what it that
[1:08:11] it was Redemption we believed it was
[1:08:14] Redemption the prophet of God always
[1:08:15] knew the bye
[1:08:16] was just the plan of redemption but he
[1:08:19] had never seen it like you said it after
[1:08:21] the seals broke light had what never
[1:08:24] shined on him but when that mighty angel
[1:08:27] came down in revelations 10 when that
[1:08:29] mighty angel came down and shine that
[1:08:31] light on that book the Bible became a
[1:08:34] brand new book the thunders uttered
[1:08:36] their voices all right number 7
[1:08:44] questions and answer number four this is
[1:08:47] convert or turn doctrine this was after
[1:08:50] the seals have the seven thunders which
[1:08:53] equals seven mysteries already been
[1:08:56] revealed that's a question were they
[1:08:58] revealed in the seven seals but are yet
[1:09:00] not known to us as the thunders yet no
[1:09:05] they were revealed in the seven seals
[1:09:08] that's what the thunders was about they
[1:09:13] was to reveal the seven thunders that
[1:09:14] had uttered their voices and no one
[1:09:17] could make out what it was John knew
[1:09:20] what it was but was forbidden to ride it
[1:09:23] like I said John was what told to write
[1:09:25] what he saw right he saw the super plan
[1:09:30] of redemption because you know what John
[1:09:32] didn't put in his commentary he said now
[1:09:34] I don't know what this is
[1:09:35] no he was immediately beginning to write
[1:09:37] it down why it wasn't something
[1:09:40] unfamiliar to John but John wasn't what
[1:09:47] in tune and pressurized to take it at
[1:09:51] that time so God said seal it up and I'm
[1:09:55] going to what but in the days of the
[1:09:58] voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:10:01] begins to sound that's why that buts
[1:10:02] there but the seven angel but the
[1:10:04] seventh angel in the day of it sounding
[1:10:06] the seven mysteries of the seven
[1:10:08] thunders would be revealed and the
[1:10:11] seventh angel is a messenger of the
[1:10:13] seventh church age see the bay all right
[1:10:16] say ma'am so the thunders were hid in
[1:10:19] the seals not something I you I read you
[1:10:22] where it says no they're different now
[1:10:24] they are they're different but it's not
[1:10:26] that the seal is way over here and the
[1:10:28] thunders is out of the Bible or the
[1:10:30] the seals in the Bible and thunders out
[1:10:32] of the Bible no it's just that the seals
[1:10:34] are seal 1 this happened seal two it's
[1:10:37] written in the Bible seal - this is what
[1:10:40] happens seal 3 so for still 5 sissies
[1:10:43] right
[1:10:45] but the thunders are not and the first
[1:10:47] Thunder sounded and and the second no
[1:10:50] but listen it's got to tie the whole
[1:10:52] Bible together and there's only one
[1:10:55] thing that's common in all the Bible
[1:11:00] Redemption the Bible was written so that
[1:11:05] a group of people could be redeemed
[1:11:11] saved whatever what do you want to say
[1:11:13] right it was written for the foundation
[1:11:20] of the world why because God saw a group
[1:11:23] of people that would need it
[1:11:26] listen how are you gonna get redeemed
[1:11:29] how did you get redeemed hide your soul
[1:11:32] get redeemed reading the comic book just
[1:11:35] so get redeemed in a beer joint well
[1:11:37] some my mother but anyway you had to
[1:11:39] hear the word of God it wasn't you heard
[1:11:41] you buddies getting you another Miller
[1:11:43] Lite got it so what was it it was
[1:11:48] something that came out of the Bible
[1:11:50] that's why I love my favorite scripture
[1:11:54] Genesis 1:26 is my favorite scripture
[1:11:55] that's why I hinge my salvation on is
[1:12:00] that I am part of that Genesis 1:26 man
[1:12:02] because if at Genesis 1:26 man never
[1:12:05] died never had a bad thought never fell
[1:12:10] then I'm in pretty good shape
[1:12:12] I just got to get this guy the second
[1:12:16] part of the revelations got to be
[1:12:18] revealed the first parts already been
[1:12:20] revealed because if you're sitting here
[1:12:22] today and you're hearing the Word of God
[1:12:24] and if it is what quickened in your
[1:12:26] heart you are receiving the Thunderer
[1:12:29] revelation that no one else has ever
[1:12:31] received listen we can hardly talk to
[1:12:37] other message people besides worldly
[1:12:40] people besides the nomination people how
[1:12:41] long you think you can talk to people
[1:12:44] bro Kali how long not long right so what
[1:12:50] so you're a mystery
[1:12:52] you're the greatest mystery that ever
[1:12:54] was
[1:12:55] you're the hidden mystery that dick
[1:12:58] Addison and a mark action rock can walk
[1:13:00] through life be a born again child of
[1:13:04] God and walking in the most dark age
[1:13:10] that was ever on the face of the earth
[1:13:13] you think the Dark Ages were dark it was
[1:13:15] dark because why because they killed
[1:13:18] them physically but now they're dying
[1:13:21] spiritually you can't talk to anybody
[1:13:25] hardly without what crossing them bring
[1:13:34] a quote Micah now let's go to number
[1:13:37] eight and I will ask you a question and
[1:13:42] what we're going to do is we're going to
[1:13:45] read number eight and nine and number
[1:13:47] eight is this a silently in sir the
[1:13:54] mysteries he's some of the mysteries in
[1:13:56] the Bible here's the mystery a mystery
[1:13:58] of Scripture listen we've read scripture
[1:14:00] all my life right okay Bab just read it
[1:14:04] a different way than we do Methodist
[1:14:05] read it a different way than we do okay
[1:14:07] is a previously hidden truth now
[1:14:11] divinely revealed the property God come
[1:14:14] and brought what restoration back from
[1:14:17] father son Holy Ghost all the all the
[1:14:20] new eternal hell brought them back line
[1:14:24] them up right divinely revealed but
[1:14:29] which is a supernatural element still
[1:14:31] remains despite the revelation
[1:14:34] despite the revelation there's a mystery
[1:14:37] involved same scripture not different
[1:14:43] not a different revelation but to
[1:14:48] Revelation with light on him that word
[1:14:52] would light on it that had never shined
[1:14:54] before
[1:14:57] that all right that's my brother Brown
[1:15:03] preached God in simplicity what's the
[1:15:06] simplest thing in the world plan a
[1:15:08] Redemption to me is the simplest thing
[1:15:10] in the world and brother Branham brought
[1:15:13] justification right down the way it
[1:15:14] should be there should be no question he
[1:15:16] brought sanctification down the way it
[1:15:18] should be he brought the baptism of the
[1:15:19] Holy Ghost the most simple thing to me
[1:15:22] as a plan of redemption but people in
[1:15:26] this message do away with all that and
[1:15:29] they say oh you believe the message
[1:15:30] you're you're born again you gotta be
[1:15:31] born again you believe the message that
[1:15:33] God will believe that's messy he got
[1:15:36] here for you didn't he'll leave after
[1:15:37] you do
[1:15:40] he knows brother Brennan was a prophet
[1:15:42] he was a spiritual he's a spiritual guy
[1:15:44] remember saying the spiritual guy he's
[1:15:46] not some dummy
[1:15:48] remember brother Brown said what God's
[1:15:51] getting ready to do something for you he
[1:15:53] said watch Satan will feel like and what
[1:15:55] step in front he sees it and feels it
[1:15:59] before you do it's like who was it
[1:16:03] Wednesday night Aaron you start getting
[1:16:07] a revelation from God somebody you ain't
[1:16:11] heard from in 20 years will call you on
[1:16:12] the phone the kids that have never
[1:16:16] bothered you before
[1:16:18] decide to repaint their bedroom they
[1:16:24] decide to go outside and put butter on
[1:16:27] your car something goofy why that's
[1:16:31] nothing a little kid phones to devil's
[1:16:33] fault the devil hates revelation I'm
[1:16:37] quoting the Prophet if you don't know
[1:16:38] that
[1:16:38] Satan hates revelation cuz he knows if
[1:16:41] he can keep us from revelation what's he
[1:16:43] been keeping him from down to the search
[1:16:45] ages he's been keeping what even the
[1:16:49] child of God from the fullness of that
[1:16:51] what they're supposed to be amen
[1:16:58] I'll guarantee you this would be strange
[1:17:02] to Martin Luther for about 1 or 2
[1:17:03] sermons but after about 1 or 2 sermons
[1:17:07] guess what that holy ghost inside Martin
[1:17:08] Luther oh say that's why that said that
[1:17:11] that's why that said that that's why
[1:17:13] that said that that's why and he would
[1:17:15] be running these I was begging for he
[1:17:18] said I saw the just shall live by faith
[1:17:20] I was looking through a keyhole I was
[1:17:22] just seeing just a little bit but oh man
[1:17:24] there's a roomful there's a roomful of
[1:17:27] Revelation in here that's what the Holy
[1:17:29] Ghost is all about hey man so now let's
[1:17:36] take our two parts and we'll be finished
[1:17:38] in a second
[1:17:39] now sorry won't be finished in a second
[1:17:44] everybody knows what this is right we've
[1:17:46] already drew this one time there's your
[1:17:49] candlestick
[1:17:49] there's your church ages right and head
[1:17:51] the dark part in the light part in the
[1:17:52] dark part you understand that everybody
[1:17:54] got that same an all right so now we
[1:17:58] have a two part message this is the
[1:18:00] first part restoring back all that have
[1:18:04] been lost in their ages amen
[1:18:10] then you have a space got it all right
[1:18:18] you got the body you got the body but
[1:18:22] remember the body is nothing without the
[1:18:26] but remember through the church ages
[1:18:29] this was wiped out it didn't don't know
[1:18:31] what wasn't done away with what it was
[1:18:33] covered light did not shine on when
[1:18:36] listen when Christ left the scene I
[1:18:39] steamed about this other day June and
[1:18:41] I've been married 38 years last Friday's
[1:18:45] a week ago and I've seen there every day
[1:18:48] for those 38 years pretty much
[1:18:55] you know what I'm trying trying to be
[1:18:58] crude I like to touch her I like to know
[1:19:01] she's there I like to have an intimate
[1:19:03] relationship with my wife Jesus Christ
[1:19:06] when he left this earth 2,000 years ago
[1:19:08] he has never had an intimate
[1:19:10] relationship like he wants to have one
[1:19:13] people realize that he is so patient
[1:19:18] waiting
[1:19:19] ohoo me and you to get ready so I can
[1:19:23] hug us so he can fellowship with a
[1:19:26] surety fellowship but he's not in this
[1:19:28] dimension he wants a wife in his own
[1:19:32] dimension he wants a wife we can hug her
[1:19:35] we can talk face-to-face with her
[1:19:38] the problem is were why we're in this
[1:19:41] dimension of sin and death now I go quit
[1:19:45] preaching come on
[1:19:47] but it's the truth I was thinking the
[1:19:49] other day my finds seen Jim for 2,000
[1:19:52] years I've been crazy maybe 2,000
[1:19:58] minutes would be horrible seconds but
[1:20:02] you see that you take that and you take
[1:20:04] that by millions brother Brown said the
[1:20:07] love for your wife by millions
[1:20:09] that's just filial love what about the
[1:20:13] godly love of God that's the headstone
[1:20:17] look right here right here look that's
[1:20:21] the love that he has for us and he's
[1:20:26] tried his best to get us to see it but
[1:20:30] we're going I don't know by that I don't
[1:20:35] know
[1:20:36] ain't that right he wants to see us with
[1:20:42] his own flesh eyes he's looking now what
[1:20:48] through the blood brother devil so much
[1:20:51] that's this morning he can't see us he
[1:20:54] can't see us he can hear our voice but
[1:20:57] what about a wife and no one that she's
[1:20:59] just right there and you can't get to
[1:21:02] her until she comes to a place old
[1:21:04] people we need to come to a place
[1:21:06] we think we have joy with our spouse and
[1:21:10] our children that's nothing compared to
[1:21:12] the joy in Jesus Christ amen all right
[1:21:18] so number one he what he comes to
[1:21:20] restore the faith of the fathers all
[1:21:23] right got it and we do this last Sunday
[1:21:25] we showed you all the all the messages
[1:21:28] that he preached we're not going to see
[1:21:29] that but remember brother Branham he
[1:21:30] preaches the church ages all right then
[1:21:34] what then there's a breach between the
[1:21:37] church ages in the what the seals this
[1:21:40] is not the seals this is part two if I
[1:21:46] got that okay wake up
[1:21:51] so what we're to be birthed out of the
[1:21:54] ages I know we're supposed to be birthed
[1:21:56] out of the age but we got to be birthed
[1:21:57] completely into eternity because
[1:21:59] remember the dude raised his hand and he
[1:22:02] said what time is no longer right you
[1:22:08] know what we're looking for
[1:22:10] we're time creatures we looking at a
[1:22:13] watch now going when's it going to be
[1:22:14] quiet I got something tomorrow
[1:22:15] two o'clock appointment what about if
[1:22:18] all that went away to me that be enough
[1:22:22] to write for me right there
[1:22:24] amen to know that I didn't have to go do
[1:22:27] this and do that and fix this and fix
[1:22:28] that amen
[1:22:30] but the first part of the prophets
[1:22:32] message was what to restore us back to
[1:22:34] the faith that was right here and then
[1:22:38] bring his message let's read that let's
[1:22:44] skip oh let me read this real quick to
[1:22:50] help them in the back number nine
[1:22:51] recognize your day in this message now
[1:22:54] you say well brother Brown don't look at
[1:22:56] this I forgot this brother branham he's
[1:22:59] he's already preached to seal right
[1:23:03] seals are preached seals are preached I
[1:23:07] want to ask you a question we're talking
[1:23:11] about what a supernatural element beside
[1:23:14] the revelation that came during the time
[1:23:16] that all right
[1:23:17] because watch
[1:23:21] this is no recognizing your Danis
[1:23:23] message 1964 and then why he wouldn't
[1:23:26] let me preach them seven trumpets
[1:23:28] because brother Evans gonna preach each
[1:23:29] trumpet now he preached the Feast of the
[1:23:31] trumpets which were under the Feast of
[1:23:33] the trumpet but the seven trumpets he
[1:23:36] was going to preach them I was even
[1:23:38] ready to announce that it had the Hogs
[1:23:40] ready and everything to go into it to
[1:23:42] preach the seven trumpets and I said
[1:23:46] there's something bothering me so bad I
[1:23:48] said we kept on working and Billy and
[1:23:51] all of us trying to get everything ready
[1:23:53] for the air-conditioned building look he
[1:23:55] was what he was going to have the
[1:23:56] meeting for this next coming week for
[1:23:59] the seven trumpets having ten days or
[1:24:01] eight days had School Auditorium but the
[1:24:04] Holy Spirit wouldn't let me do it for
[1:24:06] some reason and I wondered why and when
[1:24:09] I went to pray I told the wife I'm going
[1:24:12] in and sincerely I knelt down before God
[1:24:14] to pray and he revealed to me that them
[1:24:17] seven trumpets sounded under the sixth
[1:24:20] seal and I've done preached it
[1:24:23] supernaturally go to the sixth seal and
[1:24:28] see where he did he mentions the
[1:24:32] trumpets a few times because that's to
[1:24:35] Israel but he never he never preached
[1:24:38] verbatim you got it the Holy Spirit
[1:24:42] saying supernaturally you've already
[1:24:44] preached them because all the trumpets
[1:24:47] sound under the six seals win those two
[1:24:49] prophets hit the earth go to Israel what
[1:24:53] he'd already preached him supernaturally
[1:24:55] so what am I telling you there's a
[1:24:56] supernatural element that we don't even
[1:24:58] have written on this board because
[1:25:02] that's what's holding us here so now
[1:25:05] let's get to this let's get first
[1:25:07] Corinthians let's go to number 10 win
[1:25:09] never gonna get none now look trying to
[1:25:13] do God a service 1965 watch this now he
[1:25:16] promised in the last days what he would
[1:25:19] do and it sent them us the message and
[1:25:21] this message would have the same
[1:25:22] identification as Elijah had as Elijah
[1:25:24] had as John the Baptist said and it
[1:25:26] would turn the hearts of the people not
[1:25:28] to the denomination but back to the
[1:25:30] original Apostolic fathers by
[1:25:32] to the word how these things have been
[1:25:35] of indicated in this 1965 how that in
[1:25:39] the sounding of the last angel
[1:25:41] revelations 10 the days of seven things
[1:25:43] of these mysteries have all been why did
[1:25:45] the Methodists do list the Baptist's do
[1:25:47] this Church of Christ Jehovah Witness
[1:25:49] the mysteries will be revealed in the
[1:25:51] last day when the seventh angel seventh
[1:25:54] angels message when not when he starts
[1:25:57] out doing this look at me not when he
[1:26:00] starts out doing this this is not the
[1:26:03] seventh angels message it's part of it
[1:26:07] okay it's part of the seventh angels
[1:26:10] message but that's not what he came for
[1:26:14] I'm gonna say this in shock you any
[1:26:17] prophet could preach that any prophet if
[1:26:22] he's the prophet of God comes Paul
[1:26:26] preached didn't Peter preached it right
[1:26:27] here it's just that what Satan had
[1:26:30] eroded and eat eat till it took a major
[1:26:34] profit to bring it back and then not
[1:26:37] just go off the scene he had another
[1:26:39] party had to bring mmm now watch when he
[1:26:47] begins to sound his message see not the
[1:26:52] years in preparation this is the years
[1:26:55] in preparation restoring what the body
[1:26:59] back so that the head can fit on the
[1:27:02] body amen now let's go to the next one
[1:27:05] real quick number 11
[1:27:07] now that brings to pass today because we
[1:27:10] have faith and I know this is of God is
[1:27:13] because this and other scriptures point
[1:27:14] to this our revelations 10 said that in
[1:27:16] the hour of the seventh angels message
[1:27:18] when he begins to sound forth his
[1:27:21] message not in a healing service but the
[1:27:25] message that follows the healing service
[1:27:27] there's the healing service yeah sure
[1:27:30] that was physically people healed but
[1:27:33] they're what spiritually people were
[1:27:35] healed amen
[1:27:36] but that wasn't his message that was
[1:27:38] bringing us what toward to get to this
[1:27:41] breach to get over into this part of his
[1:27:43] message that all rights a man
[1:27:46] a man so now let's read number 12 notice
[1:27:49] quickly now she is in that stage beyond
[1:27:51] the shadow of a doubt we're in the
[1:27:52] Laodicean Church age now her messenger
[1:27:56] is promised in Malachi fourth chapter
[1:27:58] he's promised to do it and the message
[1:28:00] is to bring back the word bring the
[1:28:03] people back to the word birth is to be
[1:28:06] she's to be delivered
[1:28:07] look now delivered of a new birth from
[1:28:10] according to Malachi 4 they men not
[1:28:13] saying that this birth was wrong this
[1:28:16] birth was for their age this birth was
[1:28:19] what son of god revelation gates of hell
[1:28:23] champ can't prevail against them but
[1:28:25] they're all going to die because they
[1:28:27] don't have enough to get this body out
[1:28:28] amen
[1:28:30] but then you come and you see it they
[1:28:31] become a new birth and we were talking
[1:28:33] the other day about this that's been the
[1:28:35] breech birth what is a breech birth a
[1:28:37] breech birth is when the feet come first
[1:28:40] that's not a normal birth the head has
[1:28:43] to come first so he what does he do he
[1:28:46] turned us so the head could come out
[1:28:50] first it's not that these people didn't
[1:28:58] get born again right they got born again
[1:29:00] right under their time but we were we
[1:29:03] had a breech birth something couldn't
[1:29:05] happen there had to be a Malachi 4 birth
[1:29:07] that birth was this guy right here this
[1:29:12] manchild is going to change our body
[1:29:18] amen
[1:29:19] that Alright say ma'am but we're to be
[1:29:22] what delivered of a new birth from
[1:29:25] according to Malachi 4 then you go on to
[1:29:27] birth pains and remember in birth pains
[1:29:29] there's two in the womb of the church go
[1:29:32] to number 13 then 2 today is in the womb
[1:29:35] of the church there's a great big system

[1:29:45] deliver the word bride Church the church
[1:29:49] has got to be delivered out of her
[1:29:52] a bride for Christ so out of the ages
[1:29:54] out of all this
[1:29:55] Paul said leaving the principles of the
[1:29:57] doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[1:29:59] perfection this is perfection that all
[1:30:03] right say ma'am
[1:30:05] to save some time shaping up to a
[1:30:08] headstone number 14 - the manifestation
[1:30:11] of the sons of God coming back and the
[1:30:12] Spirit of God coming into these men so

[1:31:23] mountain fourth birth it will birth you
[1:31:25] right cuz there's nothing wrong with
[1:31:28] this message contrary to what everybody

[1:32:34] because this is the foundation we've
[1:32:35] laid it's a two-part message you got to
[1:32:40] get the first part right from 1947 to
[1:32:43] 1963 brother Branham brought the word
[1:32:45] back to where the people in the church
[1:32:49] ages understood right that's a man amen
[1:32:55] all right then in 1962-63 he comes into
[1:32:59] the breech and he gets ready to what
[1:33:01] preach the seals so you got revelations

[1:33:33] produced the bleach the beliefs blood of
[1:33:37] Christ but what did the bleep breach do
[1:33:40] what did the bleach blood do it turned
[1:33:42] us from a foot birth to a head birth hey
[1:33:45] man everything comes out all right then
[1:33:47] in Revelation six and eight God brings
[1:33:50] the little prophet along and he sets in
[1:33:52] and it just didn't happen in one week
[1:33:54] I'm sorry folks it was a three and a
[1:33:55] half year message of God hey man that
[1:33:58] was supposed to literally it's supposed
[1:34:00] to literally turn us back and a lot of
[1:34:03] things he preached he didn't verbatim
[1:34:05] preach him because remember he said what
[1:34:07] he said serpent seed was revealed in the
[1:34:09] seals now he preached the preceding 1959
[1:34:12] marriage and divorce was revealed in the
[1:34:15] seals
[1:34:16] show me where he preached marriage and
[1:34:17] divorce in the seal so there must be
[1:34:19] something that was that thunder that
[1:34:21] Thunder exploding out of Revelation and
[1:34:24] nobody had ever known how in the world
[1:34:27] can a man stand and say go on as you are
[1:34:34] in other words your sins have been wiped
[1:34:37] off because of misinterpreted theology
[1:34:42] when right here this right here folks is
[1:34:46] not misinterpreted theology this
[1:34:49] straightens out misinterpreted theology
[1:34:51] because when the head was here he said
[1:34:53] it wasn't so from the beginning he never
[1:34:56] told him Paul give him a grace and
[1:34:59] brother Graham gave a grace grace Moses
[1:35:01] give a grace
[1:35:02] Jesus never gave a grace while he was on
[1:35:04] earth he said it wasn't so from the
[1:35:07] beginning he said because the hardness
[1:35:09] of your heart Moses gave you a writing
[1:35:11] of divorcement sure he's the one that
[1:35:12] did it we know that but he didn't stand
[1:35:14] there and say it's all right guys y'all
[1:35:15] just do what you won't do he couldn't do
[1:35:18] that and be the word because the word
[1:35:20] says your old husband got to be dead
[1:35:22] before you may again you're old what
[1:35:24] denominational husband better be dead so
[1:35:27] Christ can be made alive in your heart
[1:35:30] you love the Lord let's read number 17
[1:35:37] let's get revelations 5 will start
[1:35:40] revelations 5 next thank you

[1:35:46] took the book out of the right hand of
[1:35:47] him that said upon the throne who was it
[1:35:50] the owner the original owner that had
[1:35:53] the book of Redemption in his right hand
[1:35:54] and no angel no angelic being nothing
[1:35:58] else to take the place and this bloody
[1:36:00] lamb walked out and took the book out of
[1:36:02] his hand what was it brother this is the
[1:36:04] most sublime thing in the scripture
[1:36:07] alright that not an angel not nothing
[1:36:11] can do it and the lamb coming took it
[1:36:14] from the right hand of him that set upon
[1:36:16] the throne what was it now it belongs to
[1:36:20] the lamb
[1:36:22] hey ma'am now it belongs to the lamb and
[1:36:25] if you're born again where's that lamb
[1:36:29] somewhere out there somewhere that
[1:36:32] grandma says that they'd be sitting on a
[1:36:34] cloud he's in your heart he's the one
[1:36:43] that's speaking to you the lamb is the
[1:36:46] one that's doing the speaking because
[1:36:49] remember the Lambs the one that broke
[1:36:51] the seals hey man so now let's read this
[1:36:54] last one in the breach now what's the
[1:36:57] Holy Ghost Holy Spirit been doing he

[1:37:09] Spirit inspects that person until he's

[1:37:43] day that the book of redemption has been
[1:37:47] revealed and the Redeemer comes to claim
[1:37:50] his possession nothing can do it don't

[1:38:17] look look watch the first two can be
[1:38:20] impersonated this can all be
[1:38:22] impersonated but that can't the third
[1:38:26] pole cannot be impersonated it's what
[1:38:28] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:38:30] personally to you that no one else is
[1:38:33] gonna get no one else is going to
[1:38:36] know anything about I'll fold this thing
[1:38:48] up one of these days mmm when I can
[1:38:55] let's sing a song working for a few
[1:38:58] minutes let me read you this while he's
[1:39:01] getting ready listen this I I kind of
[1:39:03] caught this get the right one souls in
[1:39:19] prison 1963 you know we were talking the
[1:39:21] other day and this is so profound I had
[1:39:25] not seen this before that he I knew I
[1:39:27] believe this but watch
[1:39:29] but one day he rose from there came
[1:39:31] forth where was the book at now this is
[1:39:35] right after the seals 11 10 1963 soldier
[1:39:38] in prison it is still in the abstract
[1:39:41] owner God Almighty and John looked
[1:39:43] around and he wept because there was no
[1:39:45] man even worthy to look on the book and
[1:39:48] especially opened the seals to reveal
[1:39:51] what the hidden mystery was the
[1:39:54] mysteries was in the seven seals
[1:39:57] when these seven seals was opened that
[1:39:59] opened up the entire Bible and you
[1:40:02] listen to this the seven seals it was
[1:40:05] sealed with seven mysteries and in these
[1:40:09] seven seals held the entire mystery of
[1:40:14] it will read this next Sunday again and
[1:40:15] it was the book of redemption hold on
[1:40:19] man
[1:40:20] comma New Testament next paragraph not
[1:40:24] the old now look and I got to question
[1:40:30] that myself but remember the Old
[1:40:33] Testament type Redemption when when when
[1:40:38] boaz took ruth that wasn't redemption
[1:40:41] that was a type of redemption but when
[1:40:44] Christ come that wasn't a type
[1:40:47] he says look not the old it only
[1:40:50] proclaimed for the New Testament they
[1:40:53] have been made cannot be made perfect
[1:40:55] without us Hebrews 11 see see now the
[1:40:58] redemption only come when the Redeemer
[1:41:00] died and they were potentially under the
[1:41:04] blood of lambs not the Redeemer hadn't
[1:41:07] been redeemed yet until the Redeemer
[1:41:10] came so the Old Testament could not have
[1:41:13] the Holy Ghost they could not have they
[1:41:16] could not listen they're not considered
[1:41:21] in the redemption that we're considered
[1:41:22] in they never received the new birth
[1:41:25] like we received the new birth and the
[1:41:28] new birth is what's going to take us to
[1:41:29] that headstone and then they only spoke
[1:41:32] of it the blood of bulls and goats and
[1:41:34] goats covered sin they didn't do away
[1:41:38] with sin but when that cover came off at
[1:41:40] Calvary the sale what he's not but one
[1:41:44] seal and that's the baptism of the holy
[1:41:46] go that puts you in the body of Christ
[1:41:49] that's the only seal there is a man
