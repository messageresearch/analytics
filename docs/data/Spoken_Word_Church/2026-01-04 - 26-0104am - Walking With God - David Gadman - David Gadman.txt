TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and he showed me [music] that I could be free. Then he lifted [singing] my feet, gave me gloryy complete [music and singing] when he reached down his hand. Glory. [music] Let's sing the next verse. Now my heart doth rejoice since [singing] I've made [music] him my choice. From the tempest to him now I flee. Now I lean on his arms. I'm secure from our heart [music] since he reached down his hand for me. When he reached down his hand for me. [music] many reach way down for me. I was lost and undone without God [singing] or his [music] son when he raised down [music] his hand for me. Let's all stand. Let's all stand this morning. Since the Lord gave me peace, [music] heavenly joy never seen. When I give all my life unto [music and singing] thee, guide my feet, [music] hold my hand. And with thee [music and singing] I may stand. For you reach down your hand for me. [music] When he [singing] reach down his hand for me. [music] any reach way [music] down for me. I was lost and undone [music] without God or [singing] his son when he reached down his [singing] hand [music] for me. Amen. Just give him a hand. [applause] &gt;&gt; Tell you a little story right quick. I uh go in my Bible every day and I I send out little scriptures to different people I've met throughout my life that want me to and I just send them to them. And uh as I I run into these scriptures, I wind up reading a lot more just to understand it. And I get into Micah and and based on what Aaron was preaching this morning about God's word having to be unfolded. It's not only unfolded from the beginning. If we not had his word, we wouldn't have any way of communicating with him. So, he's always trying to bring us to a place. And uh I run into this place that in Micah I couldn't understand that fifth chapter. I just couldn't. And I I was telling Aaron about it. And so last night, I really really got to bugging. and turn the football game off. And I just sat there and I went through the went through and and started reading it. And I got down to the end in seven where the point he was trying to show me throughout all the misunderstanding and not understanding the word was he said, "Look, you're going to have these things of judgment. They're coming because you're born in sin shaped iniquity. You're going to have it. But I'd rather he is delighted in mercy. That's what he wants to give us is mercy." &gt;&gt; Amen. throughout all things that you got to understand about God, if you don't understand one thing, he wants to give you mercy. And mercy is receiving that new birth completely. That's what that's about. And uh I I fought and I struggled with it and I tried to figure it out. And I loved what I was reading. I could see some types and shadows in there, but I really didn't get the point. He's always trying to show you a little small thing, and I blew it up as usual. So I I pray for his understanding and his wisdom on his word. Now that that being said, we'll just go to his pray pray thank him right now for his word. Precious heavenly father, we thank you for this day you've given us to come and gather around your word. And what a beautiful day it is you've given us to come, Lord. And as I look at out all these smiling little glowing lights out here, Father, this morning that you brought to come gather around your word. You said where two or three meet, you'd be here also, Lord God. So we know you're here with us, Father. And we just ask today that you just bless each one. Open their ears and your understandings, Lord. And just fill them with your grace and your mercy and your love, Father, as you really rather give us that mercy than anything cuz we put the tribulation out there. And we're the ones that bring it, Lord. But Father, you always come in and give us the understanding, the peace, and the mercy, your word. And we ask now, Father, that today you'd bless Brother David Gabman has come a long way to bring his word to us, Lord, that you've given him. and just let him speak that word you placed on his heart. Father, come across those lips you made of clay. And father, we ask today also just be with brother Wade and not here and brother Luis is traveling. Lord, just grant them safe journey and bless their fellowship with each other and and most of all their fellowship out there with people, Lord, and just be with them and bless them and bring them home safely, Father. Glad to have the Canada's back, Lord, and the other ones that's been traveling. And Father, today we ask especially that you bless those that couldn't get through the door today. Whatever the hindrance is, you know what it is. And just bless them and be with them and strengthen them, Father God. Especially the little ones that's gone astray wandering around out in the desert, Lord. Cuz you said we'd be there with our offspring. And I got some tough ones, Lord. I think I got the toughest ones in here. And I ask, Father, you just bless them and be with them and whatever it takes to get them here, Father, just bring them on in. And we just ask now, Lord, as we go to the reading of your word, you just come on the scene, Father, and you be the one to bless your word to us, Father, because we need it. We get in the way way too much. Thank you for your mercy and your grace. We ask these things in your name, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Uh we're going to Psalms 143 this morning. We're going to read uh 1-2. Hear my prayer, O Lord. Give ear to my supplications. In thy faithfulness, answer me in thy righteousness. &gt;&gt; Enter not into judgment with thy servant. For in thy sight shall no man be. &gt;&gt; For the enemy hath persecuted my soul. He hath smite my life down to the ground. He hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been long dead. &gt;&gt; Therefore, my spirit overcomes within me. My heart meant &gt;&gt; I remember the days of old. I meditate on all thy works. I muse on the work of thy hands. I stretch forth my hands. My soul thirsty. &gt;&gt; Hear me speededly, O Lord. My spirit faileth. Hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. &gt;&gt; For in thee do I trust. wherein I should walk for I lift up my soul unto thee. &gt;&gt; Deliver me, oh Lord, from mine enemies. I flee unto thee to hide me. &gt;&gt; Teach me to do thy will my God. Thy spirit is good. Lead me into the land of upright. &gt;&gt; Quicken me, oh Lord, for thy name's sake. For thy righteousness sake, bring my soul out of trouble. and out of mercy cut off mine enemies and destroy all them that afflict my soul for I am thy servant. Amen. Thank you for the reading of the word. You may be seated. Amen. Amen. Brother Boy, would you mind help us with ti and offerings this morning.

By and by, when the morning comes, when all the saints of [music] God are gathered home, we will tell the story how we overcome. [music] For we'll understand it better by and by.

For we'll understand it better by and by. Yes. By and by. When the morning comes, when all the saints of God are gathered home, we will tell the story how we overcome.

You ready for the word this morning? Amen. And we appreciate brother David being with us this morning. And as brother Wade says, he doesn't need an introduction. I think most everybody [music] knows him all the way from the great state of Alabama. And we don't we don't hold that against him. Some people say, but we appreciate brother David and his stand and God touched him. I guess it was this year, last year and come through a lot, but praise God is he's still a miracle work in God. He's still the healer. You know, God put a gift in a man's life to do a work. And you know, the devil wasn't [music] happy with it trying to stop him. But you know what? A lot of prayers of saints went up and you know we got behind our brother and prayed for him and [music] believe God touch him. We seen a miracle. We thank God for him and we thank God for his ministry and continue to pray that God will bless him and use him more wherever he goes that people will be touched and God can do work in people's lives [music] and we appreciate him. And as brother David comes this morning, we're going to sing word of God ever true. We're going to have brother David just take his liberty this morning. [music] Just say whatever's on his heart.

We thank him for his goodness and his mercy to us. Amen. Just just wanted to greet you and tell you that I appreciate you and appreciate brother Wade having me while he's gone. and just want to give the word this testimony for a little bit, you know, just, you know, then we'll get right into the word of God. But I want to say I appreciate the Lord and I appreciate his healing touch, &gt;&gt; you know, cuz I fought this battle for oh maybe year and a half, two years. I just passing blood and just uh didn't know what it was and just uh you know just you know trying to believe God and you know you want to believe God and everything and finally went to the doctor and finally she sent and or she uh let me uh gave me this uh colonoscopy doctor to go to and then uh through that he couldn't get it done because uh my oxygen level dropped and uh my uh heart started acting up. So from about a year a little over a year and a half I trying to get everything my heart tended to while my oxygen level dropped and everything and just finally got it tended to and then but still losing blood and everything and so she said and so I went back to her and she said well let me do want to take some blood from you and everything and then she called me she said David she said you're losing blood from somewhere said I don't know where you losing it from said and said your said your blood level or uh uh iron level is down to about an eight said it need or uh says if it drops one more level so we're going to have to do a blood transfusion said but said I'm going to put you in some iron tablets and said eat as much liver as you want and as much greens as you want and everything because you got to get your blood back up said but said I'm going to send you to refer you to this colonoscopy doctor so finally when I finally went in and everything regulated I took that it was this is in April took a polip out that was about 5 in or 5 cmters I'm sorry 5 centimeters which is about 2 in. So then he said just I said I'll call you or he gave me his personal number said call me said if you don't hear from me. So he called and then he called me back. He said it was Canress said but I think I believe I got it all and so he said wanted to do a PET scan on me. Did a CT scan or CAT scan all these scans and everything and so he said we got it all but said you need this uh this section of your colon said you need it taken out. said, "It's just naring." He said, "You need it taken out." So said, "Do you have a a surgeon that you uh you you know?" I said, "No." I said, "So he referred me to one and he had to cancel on me." And so I got another one. But you know, the Lord knows everything. &gt;&gt; And so during that time, I had another colonosby that was in April. I had no another one in May. And then in June, it just seemed like, man, just seemed like everything went haywire south. and I, you know, just running to the bathroom back and forth and everything. Ended up in the hospital and he and then I ended up having another colonoscopy while I was in the hospital. And then when I went to see him, he said, "Hey, he he" and said, "Hey, the his nurse practitioner said, I'm testing you for three things. IBS, ulcerated colitis, and Crohn's." And she said, "I think you got Crohn's." She said, "I'm just I said, I just believe that." And so, so I went to his office and after she done it, after they tested me with the blood and everything, he said, "Well, I don't think he got Crohn's." He said, "All the signs look like it, but he said, I think he had food poisoning or whatever." Finally, he said, "But hey, we don't want you to do that colonoscopy right now." I said, "You need to wait." His nurse practitioner said, "You just your colon's just angry." And said, "So, waited for about a month. In July, about the end of July, had the colonoscopy. They took 10 inches of mullen out, but praise the Lord, no bag, all that. And I just thank God. And then the the nurse practitioner that of of my surgeon, she said, "I'm from the old school." She said, "I got two siblings. One died with cancer, one fighting cancer." Said, "I just want to send you to a cancer doctor." So, we went to a cancer doctor and he said, "I got good news." Said, "You got you had said what you we call that stage one." Said, "You don't need no treatments or anything." said, "I want to see you." [applause] Amen. Said, "I want to see you back in February just to for blood test and everything to keep a check on you." And I stopped him right there. I said, "You know what?" I said, "I thank God for the knowledge that you gave that he gave you to help me and treat me, but my ultimate healing comes from our body, God." &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] And so in ju so in July when they took that out and everything he said everything looked good and said so cuz he wanted two sections to to to tie it back together. He said both sections had to be healthy. So you know said everything looks good. So I was on a diet. I lost all through all this I lost about 37 pounds but I gained some of that back because of this year you know this time of year you know and all that them little Debbie Christmas tree cakes and all that. So, [laughter] I'm glad that's over with. So, but anyway, anyway, so and so my colonoscopy doctor, he gave me another colonoscopy a couple months back in November. He said, "I got some good news." He said, "I don't have to see you for a year." &gt;&gt; So, I thank God. Amen. And I told him, I said, "Well, hey, my ultimate healing comes from him." I said, "I'm thankful for you. I'm glad that God hooked me up with you, but my ultimate healing comes from him." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I appreciate that. Amen. I appreciate God's still a healer. &gt;&gt; Amen. He heals through many different ways. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I But I appreciate him. I appreciate being here this morning. Amen. Let me just read you this real quick and then we'll get right into the word of God. You love him this morning. You appreciate his goodness and mercy to you. Amen. This is from the message Salom. He said, "My time belongs to him. I'm his. I'm in his hand because he holds the time. I don't know what the future holds, but I know he holds the future. So he who holds the future holds me. So why should I think about setting forth this that the other for the new year? &gt;&gt; Hey, why should I worry? &gt;&gt; You know, we all we're humans. We all worry, don't we? &gt;&gt; Some aspect we do worry. Hey, they went she he called me and said it was cancerous. Hey, I just got kind of quiet, but back in my mind, you know, but I know he's the healer. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he said, "Why should we set forth this, that, or the other, you know, for the new year? I just put myself in his hands. Walk like David did. My time is in his hands." I know that I knew that God held the future. David didn't know what the future was, but he know God had the future. I don't know what the future is. None of us do, but we know he holds the future. &gt;&gt; Have the message shalom. Amen. So, I say shalom to you this. Amen. Happy New Year and trust everybody had a good new year. Somebody asked me, he said, "Did you have a happy new year?" I said, "I don't know. It just got started." [laughter] But I know he holds the future and I know he holds my hand. Let's stand together. Amen. You love him this morning. You appreciate him. If you have your Bibles, turn with us to the book of Genesis, the fifth chapter. Just a little thought, just kind of on my heart, just kind of not knowing what to preach on. And brother, when brother Wade called me and everything, you know, like I said, I told him many years a uh a couple uh months back, you know, and I said, you know, you never I would have never dreamed that we'd be here, 2026. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hey, when I we first came in the message, my mom Arnson closing it in. He goes, "David, I'll be surprised you see your 12th birthday." Well, Brother Wade's 65. He'll be 65 the end of the month. I'll be 65 in August. Thank brother. Hey, and I never thought, hey, but here we are &gt;&gt; still fighting the greatest battle I' ever fought. &gt;&gt; We don't know what tomorrow holds, but we know who holds tomorrow. &gt;&gt; And I know who holds my hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, just this little thought this morning if you can for the new year. Amen. Verse chapter 5 of Genesis verse 22 of chapter 5. And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and daughters. And all the days of Enoch were 360 and five years. And Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him. May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of the word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then over in the book, still over in the book of Genesis, chapter 6, one chapter over verse 8 and N of chapter 6 of Genesis, it says, "But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord." These are the generations of Noah. Noah is a just man and perfect in his generation. And Noah walked with God. &gt;&gt; If I take a little thought this morning, it'd be walking with God. And I hope that every one of us for this new year can walk with him. &gt;&gt; I want to walk with him. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Now, I got this little deal. Somebody had read this one time and and y'all might have forgot it. I hope so. You know, you can't forget a lot of things anymore because people put things on Facebook and, you know, and and and Instagram and all that, you know, you want to show pictures. You know how it is when you I remember when, you know, your parents first become, you know, grandparents, you like to show your, "Hey, this is my grandson. This is my granddaughter." you see, you know, but now you can't hardly do that cuz, you know, people's got Facebook. Oh, I've seen that. I've seen that. So, takes the joy out of being a grandparent sometimes, you know, but anyway, here we are, you know, and so I appreciate that, you know, we got five and, you know, they're just, you know, I appreciate that. You know, they're they live in Oklahoma. Stephanie, many of you know Stephanie and Harry. And, you know, my oldest grandson, he plays the guitar in the church there and just, you know, I'm proud of him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He got his driver's license when we was there back in think of October. And he said, "Papa, can you go with me cuz dad's got to work?" I said, "Okay." We get in the car and I started telling said, "Now look, when you get in the car and she tells you what to do and then I said, you know what? You don't want to listen to this. You don't want to hear this. You you're you're 16 going on 30. You you don't want to hear this." [laughter] You know, so but anyway, we thank God for him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, listen what this says. This says it says the universal this is talking about and he uses this scripture Psalms 14:1 he and and Psalms 14 verse 1 through uh three he uses this scripture he said the fool has said in his heart there is no God &gt;&gt; they are corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doeth good the Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek God all gone aside they're all together become filthy. There is none that doeth good, know not one. I thought my what a pitiful statement is. There's none that doeth good, know not one. And then writer says the universal prevalence of lust and violence encouraged by longevity or long duration which put the thought of death far away from the uh antidolivians and and was a proximate cause of the destruction of the ungodly world. A confluence or merging of various streams of evil had swelled into an overflowing torrent of corruption. The adulteress uh by atheistical by the atheistical race of Cain. The religious decline. The religious declining and final apostasy of the Sethites who disappointed in their hope of the promised deliverer abandoned their faith are attracted by worldly prosperity and gay lives of the Canaanites gradually convulted their society and forming matrimonial alliances with them merged into full conformity with the world. the forms of worship being abandoned and all sins of true germanal religion extinguished, wickedness increased with fearful rapidity until in the 10th generation the iniquity of the old world came into the full. The kingdom of God was overthrown. Satan reigned supreme in the world and converted this earth into a province of hell. Their heart was not it was deceitful and deprived and and and the thoughts of the heart were wicked and all that said the the imagination of the thoughts of the heart so that their designs and devices were wicked. They did not do evil through mere carelessness as though they walked at all adventures not heeding what they do but they did evil deliberately and designly contriving how to do mischief. It was bad indeed, for it was only evil, continually evil, and every imagination was so. There was no good to be found among them, no not one at any time. The stream of sin was full and strong and constant, and God saw it. &gt;&gt; Now, can you imagine here? It was there. They said their their conformity with the world, their their adulterous uh hour by the atheistical race of Cain, all this religious decline and everything. You look around. Hey, the Bible says, "It was then, so is it now." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here's what it here's what this guy wrote. He said, "This was the condition of the earth in the days of Enoch to Noah." said every sin, every evil thought, every uh kind of violence, every kind of corruption, the attitude more uh uh race of Cain dominated the atheistic race. Cain dominated mixed marriages, conformity to the world. Their hearts were evil. Their attitudes were evil. Their dispositions were evil. Their designs were corrupt. And their walk was wicked. &gt;&gt; And yet Enoch walked with God. &gt;&gt; All this was going on. Their thoughts were evil. Their their their their every kind of violence, every kind of corruption. Yet Enoch walked with God. And then it was said here that Noah was a just man and perfect in his generation. And Noah walked with God. And neither one of them had the Holy Ghost like we do. &gt;&gt; But they still walked with God. So I wonder about us this morning. Hey, if if THEY WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST WALKED WITH GOD AND THEIR days was corrupt and you look at it TODAY AND THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE. &gt;&gt; Everywhere we turn is just full of corruption, &gt;&gt; full of evil. EVERY DESIGN, EVERY THOUGHT, EVERY WAY YOU TURN, EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK, IT'S EVIL. BUT YET, THEY STILL WALK WITH GOD. WHAT ABOUT ME AND YOU THIS HOUR THAT WE'RE LIVING IN IN 2026? I WANT TO SAY, GOD, HELP ME TO WALK WITH YOU THEN. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do &gt;&gt; is walk with God. Now, let's just look at this. Let's just look at this for a little bit if we can this morning. Amen. It said here that Noah was a Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. These are the generations of Noah. Noah's a just man and perfect in his generation. Noah walked with God. And if we look at how that Noah's age, you know how that uh and and my wife was, we was talking about it this morning. Something was said and I forgot, you know, I said, "But the world is looking at all these things. They said Russia is uh popping their head up again, all these things." And everybody said, "Well, I've heard that before and I've heard this before and heard all that." But one of these days is going to be reality. Don't you think they always heard uh in in 120 years that Noah was alive and preaching that they said, "Well, we've heard that before. It's going to rain." &gt;&gt; NO ONE HAS SAID THAT BEFORE. IT'S GOING TO RAIN. BUT ONE DAY, IT BECAME A REALITY. &gt;&gt; And to some of them, IT WAS TOO LATE &gt;&gt; because they didn't get IN THE ARK AND THEY DIDN'T WALK WITH GOD. WHAT ABOUT ME AND YOU THIS MORNING? I want TO SAY, GOD, HELP ME IN THIS NEW YEAR. NOT NOT TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF OR A NEW BEGINNING. LORD, MY FUTURE IS IN YOUR HAND. YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW. YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FIVE MINUTES FROM TODAY, FROM RIGHT NOW. BUT GOD, HELP ME TO WALK WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do. I want to walk with him. &gt;&gt; We know IT WAS A SCIENTIFIC AGE in in Noah's day that they could shoot the stars WITH RADAR AND ALL THAT, THE CLOUDS, AND THERE WAS NO WATER UP THERE. THEY BOUGHT THAT OLD CRANK. WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT? It's going to rain. &gt;&gt; They made fun of him. &gt;&gt; Probably called him ALL KINDS OF NAMES. YET HE WALKED WITH GOD. [snorts] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Let them call me what they want to. I want to walk with him this morning. &gt;&gt; I want to walk with him. Say, "Amen. I want to be so close to him." Amen. in this new year. Hey, hey, that you you can't tell the difference. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to walk with him so close to him that pe that people say, "Hey, you know that they they might NOT UNDERSTAND MY DOCTRINE. They might not understand my ways, but Lord, help them to realize that I'm walking with you and that I got Jesus on my side. Help them to realize that, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to be, Lord. I want to walk with you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was a scientific age. We we know that brother random taught that and all these things how they did all this and could do all this, but yet Noah walked with them. They they probably caught them all and they probably asked them [snorts] and let me say don't discize me, but I I was watching a a video one time DVD uh uh uh and it it was through sight and sound about and y'all all probably seen it about Noah and how that Noah they portrayed him. Now whether he had a brother or not, I don't know. But they portrayed him as having a brother. His brother came to him and said, "Noah, what are you doing up here? They're all talking about you." He said, "Well," he told to his brother, he said, "You know, we're flesh and blood blood and we've been taught all our lives to serve Christ and all this." And he said, "Yeah, but you're going to the extreme." &gt;&gt; What are you doing? All I know is God spoke to me and he's tired of all this evil. He said he's even sorry that he even made man and that he's going to destroy man from off the face OF THE EARTH BY A FLOOD. He said, "Noah, what's a flood?" Noah, I SAID, "I DON'T KNOW. All I know he said it's going to rain. It's going to flood and it's GOING TO DESTROY MANKIND AND WE GOT TO GET ON THIS ARK THAT I'M BUILDING." &gt;&gt; He probably said, "No, HIS OWN BROTHER PROBABLY THOUGHT MY NOAH, YOU'RE CRAZY." &gt;&gt; Even maybe the mayor of the city got WITH HIS BROTHER SAID, "HEY, LISTEN. WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO YOUR BROTHER? CAN'T YOU TALK SOME SENSE INTO HIM? BUT NOAH STILL WALKED WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH MAYBE HIS WHOLE FAMILY TURNED AGAINST HIM. MAYBE HIS BROTHER, MAYBE HIS MOM, HIS DAD, WHATEVER IT WAS TURNED AGAINST HIM, YET NOAH STILL WALKED WITH GOD. AND I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS MORNING, NO MATTER WHO MAY TURN AGAINST YOU today or NEXT WEEK OR WHOEVER IT MAY BE, YOUR MOM, YOUR DAD, OR WHOEVER IT MAY BE, I STILL WANT TO WALK WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Don't you? &gt;&gt; I want to walk with him. So, as we're looking at this now, let's just look at Enoch's walk this morning for a little bit, if we can, if you want to. Let's turn to Hebrews or you don't have to turn there, but if you want to make a note of it, Hebrews 11th chapter, the this is the faith chapter and the hall of fame chapter. Hebrews 11th chapter. And let's look at the fifth and sixth b verses of Hebrews 11. And let's just look at Enoch's walk for a little bit this morning and see if we can be something like Enoch &gt;&gt; because don't you want to walk with him? &gt;&gt; Let's just look at it in Hebrews 11 chapter 5th and sixth birth. It says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him. For before his translation, he had this testimony, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That he pleased God. &gt;&gt; Verse six says, "But without faith is in it is impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him." &gt;&gt; Now, let's just look at this, like I said, for a few moments this morning. WHAT IS MEANT BY Enoch's walk? Let's just look at that. Now, his walk, the Bible says, was pleasing. &gt;&gt; I hope my walk can be that way this morning. &gt;&gt; Pleasing to God. &gt;&gt; The Bible SAYS THAT HE WAS NOT FOR GOD TOOK HIM. NOW, he didn't do no special deed. Didn't do no THERE WASN'T NO MAYBE SPECIAL GIFT THAT HE HAD. BUT IT SAID BY FAITH Enoch walked RIGHT &gt;&gt; WITH GOD. BY FAITH, ENOCH WAS TRANSLATED THAT HE SHOULD NOT SEE DEATH AND WAS NOT FOUND because God had translated him. BUT BEFORE HIS TRANSLATION, HE HAD THIS TESTIMONY THAT HE PLEASED GOD. I WONDER BEFORE WE GET OUT OF HERE IF WE'LL HAVE THAT TESTIMONY THAT MY LIFE PLEASED GOD. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? You ever walk in the cemetery and you see the tombstones and the headstones of different ones and they have different, you know, like he's a good man and oh, he was one of honor and this one or he did this or he was a sergeant in the army or whatever. &gt;&gt; Maybe, you know, maybe his his didn't have much, but that, you know, or whatever, but that HE WALKED WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; OH, I HOPE THAT THAT'S WHAT MINE SAYS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE. WHEN PEOPLE READ ABOUT MY LIFE OR LOOK AT ME, I CAN SAY ONE THING ABOUT BROTHER DAVID THAT HE WALKS WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; OH, I HOPE THAT'S YOUR TESTIMONY THIS MORNING THAT YOU'RE walking with God. &gt;&gt; THAT YOUR WALK PLEASES HIM. &gt;&gt; MY WALK MAY NOT PLEASE YOU. IT MAY NOT PLEASE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, BUT I WANT IT TO PLEASE HIM THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; That's what I want my walk to do is to please him this morning. HALLELUJAH. SAYS, "BUT WITHOUT FAITH, WHICH WE KNOW FAITH IS A REVELATION, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE HIM." GOD HELP US TO HAVE THAT REVELATION OF WHAT GOD WANTS US TO DO in this hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Says, "FOR HE THAT COMETH TO GOD MUST BELIEVE THAT HE IS." SO HE SAYS THAT HE THAT COMETH TO GOD MUST FIRST BELIEVE THAT HE IS GOD. I SAY THAT HE'S GOD THIS MORNING, BROTHER AARON. &gt;&gt; I SAY THAT HE'S A HEALER THIS MORNING. HE'S A deliverer this morning. HE'S A SAVIOR this morning. &gt;&gt; You need saving, &gt;&gt; he's here to do it this morning. &gt;&gt; You need healing, he's here to do it this morning. YOU NEED DELIVERANCE, HE'S HERE TO DO IT THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He's God. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M GLAD THAT HE'S GOD. I'M GLAD HE NEVER CHANGES. MEAN, YOU MAY CHANGE, BUT HE NEVER CHANGES. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I MIGHT TELL YOU SOMETHING. HAVE TO COME BACK. AMEN. AND SAY, "I CAN'T DO IT." &gt;&gt; But he's never like that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What he says he'll do. What he promised he'd do. And he promised he'd be with us here this morning. And I believe he's here this morning. Cuz he promised where two or three are gathered together IN MY NAME THAT I'LL BE IN THE MIDST. AND I BELIEVE HE'S HERE THIS MORNING. And I believe he's GOD THIS MORNING. AMEN. YOU CAN'T TELL ME NO DIFFERENCE. HE'S GOD this morning. HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Them prayer requests that you had on the board. DON'T YOU BELIEVE HE CAN TOUCH EACH AND EVERY [laughter] NEED? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Whatever the need would be. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, one of these don't do it." He's still God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's still God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And just say, "Hey, I just want to be in his will. Whatever his will is, I want to be in it." We pray, DON'T WE PRAY? OUR FATHER, DON'T YOU WANT HIM TO BE YOUR FATHER? &gt;&gt; WHICH ART IN HEAVEN? A PLACE WHERE WE'RE GOING. A PLACE WHERE THERE'S NO MISUNDERSTANDINGS. A PLACE WHERE THERE'S NO DISAPPOINTMENTS. A PLACE WHERE THERE'S NO MORE GRAVEYARDS. A PLACE WHERE THERE'S NO MORE SICKNESS. A PLACE WHERE THERE'S NO MORE THIS, THAT, OR THE OTHER. AMEN. THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING THIS MORNING. OUR FATHER. I WANT TO BE A FATHER TO ME THIS MORNING. THERE'S A LOT OF US GROWING UP. WE DIDN'T HAVE A FATHER, BUT HE'S OUR FATHER THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHICH ART IN HEAVEN, HALLOWED BE THY NAME. &gt;&gt; In other words, HOLY AND RIGHTEOUS IS YOUR NAME. AND I TAKE ON THAT NAME. LORD, HELP ME TO LIVE A WAY THAT YOUR NAME WILL BE HONORED THROUGH MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Which art in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. &gt;&gt; Amen. This kingdom down here is not a kingdom that's fit to live in. BUT THERE'S COMING A KINGDOM THAT'S going to be fit TO LIVE IN. AND HEY, I WANT TO BE PART OF THAT KINGDOM. So let his kingdom come to me now. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says his kingdom is what? Within you. &gt;&gt; Let it be within me now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Lord, let your will I'm praying, Lord, don't change my mind or don't change your will to meet my NEED OR WHATEVER. LET MY WILL BE CHANGED TO MEET your word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Give us this day our DAILY BREAD. EVERY DAY HE'LL GIVE US WHAT WE HAVE NEED OF BOTH PHYSICALLY AND SPIRITUALLY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors. &gt;&gt; See, he's a provider. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, forgive us of our debt. He's a pardon. He can pardon us. &gt;&gt; He's a provider. He's a pardon. Forgive us of our debts if we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. He's a protector &gt;&gt; for thine is a power and the glory and honor for amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to believe that he is God. &gt;&gt; And that HE'S A REWARDER OF THEM THAT DILIGENTLY SEEK HIM. THAT WORD DILIGENTLY MEANS A ENERGETIC APPLICATION. IN OTHER WORDS, I'M GOING TO PUT EVERYTHING I GOT INTO IT. HEY, WE PUT EVERYTHING WE got into doing a lot of things, don't we? &gt;&gt; Hey, brother said he had to turn off the football game last night. &gt;&gt; Hey, but listen. If you're a football fan and if you you're not much of one if you don't get into it. Brother said if you're a dance fiend, if you don't get into it, you ain't much of a dance fiend. &gt;&gt; That's right. Hey, if you going to cut a rug, let's cut a rug. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hey, you know they say we're going to have a shin dig. How many know what a shin dig is? Then you shin and you're digging. Amen. What about COMING TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND HAVING A SHIN DIG? HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He's still real. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THAT HE'S A REWARDER THAT I WANT TO PUT EVERYTHING I GOT INTO IT. WE PUT EVERYTHING INTO HEY OUR WORK IF WE'RE GOING TO WORK WE WANT HEY HUNTING my two grandsons especially the the the middle he's the 14 YEARS OLD NOW HE LIKES HUNTING &gt;&gt; FACT THIS PASTOR went out and bought him a camouflage uh shirt pants boots and everything cuz he like he likes to do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. My oldest one, he could he like he said he said he's got to work. He's got a car now, payments and everything. He he said I got to work. So he's getting a little taste of that. So but anyway, but you put everything into it. Hey, HE'S A REWARDER OF THEM THAT HEY, DON'T IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE A HUNTER, PUT EVERYTHING YOU GOT INTO IT. WHATEVER IT IS, WE COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD NOW. LET'S WORSHIP HIM. LET'S PUT EVERYTHING WE CAN into it this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Want to put everything I got cuz he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. You believe he's a rewarder? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe also not realizing the divine presence of almighty God. You know, sometimes we spend more time, especially if we work a full-time job or whatever, we spend more time working sometimes than we do at home. And if you're working with somebody, you got a part or you know, you got somebody that you work with, you begin to know something about that person &gt;&gt; that you work with. You know what turns them on, pushes their buttons, so you don't want to, you know, you know, you you know, you know what I mean? You know, just about everything. So, you know, you I don't believe you can walk with someone daily without knowing &gt;&gt; something about him. &gt;&gt; And what about us walking with God? &gt;&gt; I don't believe we can walk with him every day without knowing a little bit OF WHAT HE'S ABOUT, &gt;&gt; WHAT PLEASES HIM, &gt;&gt; LORD. WHAT'S YOUR DESIRES? &gt;&gt; HOW SHOULD I CONDUCT MY LIFE? HOW SHOULD I CONDUCT MY LIFE AROUND YOU, LORD? AND NOT ONLY AROUND YOU, LORD, BUT EVERY DAY WHEN I WHEN I DON'T THINK YOU'RE AROUND, HOW SHOULD I CONDUCT MY LIFE? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You know, always until I really got born again, got saved, I thought, you know, ever heard that old expression, the cat's a waste, so the mice play. You know, &gt;&gt; I thought, well, the pastor's out of town, so hey, I do. But hey, Brother Wade's out of town, so hey, let's just But you know, God's still watching you. &gt;&gt; God still knows all about you. Brother Wade may be gone. Amen. Or whatever. Brother Banner may not be here, but God still knows all about you. &gt;&gt; He still knows what you thought. He knows what your very thoughts are this morning. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, the scripture says he discerner the thoughts and the intents of the heart. &gt;&gt; He knows whether you rather be here or not. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So since we're here, WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST ENJOY OURSELVES. HEY, PEOPLE DONE SEEN YOU GET OUT OF YOUR CAR, WALK IN HERE. SO, WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST ENJOY OURSELVES WHILE WE'RE HERE. &gt;&gt; WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE OLD DIG. AMEN. WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST CUT LOOSE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Walk with him. Amen. We can't walk with him every day without knowing a little bit about him, WITHOUT KNOWING HIS INTEREST, WHAT HE'S INTERESTED IN. I believe he's interested in with MY MY FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM. MY COMMUNION with him. NOT JUST A PARTAKER of the Lord's supper. We call THAT THE LORD, BUT OUR OUR real communion with him is talking back and forth with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; OH MY. HIS INTEREST. ALSO, IF YOU'RE WALKING WITH HIM, YOU'RE GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION THAT HE'S GOING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'm glad you remember the prophet uh God, brother Bosworth asked him one time said, "Brother Brand, do you know what fellowship is?" He said, "Well, I think so." He said, "That's two men in the same boat, &gt;&gt; the same ship going the same direction." So, HEY, MY FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM IS I'M GOING THE SAME direction that he's in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm in the same boat that he's in. GOING IN THE same direction. Hallelujah. Going at the same pace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going THE SAME PACE. I'M WALKING IN THE LIGHT AS HE IS THE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; They used to tell me that when people that especially the older folks they the when they used to go to church and they had when they went home at night it got dark they had to walk by lantern light and they couldn't get ahead of the light because if they got ahead of the light they'd fall in the ditch and if they got lagging behind they'd fall in the ditch. They had to stay right with the light as it shone. And that's what me and you have to do. Stay in the light as he is the light. HE'LL SHINE IN OUR PATHWAY. WALK IN THE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU'RE FAITHFUL AND WALK IN THAT LIGHT, HE'LL GIVE YOU MORE LIGHT TO walk in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. HE REALIZED THE DIVINE presence of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Maybe he couldn't feel him. Maybe he couldn't see him, but he realized HE WAS RIGHT THERE CUZ he he knew that he HAD A PROMISE THAT GOD SAID, "I'LL BE WITH YOU." HALLELUJAH. SO, I'm going at THE SAME PACE, TRAVELING THE SAME DIRECTION. I don't want no distractions. &gt;&gt; I don't WANT ANYTHING. THAT'S WHY THEY SAY NOW handsfree when you're driving. THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO BE DISTRACTED by anything. &gt;&gt; My wife tells me we got this new car. She says, "I don't have to get on to you too much, David, because that car when you going to get over to the shoulder, it starts beeping. [laughter] Get in THE NEXT LANE, STARTS BEEPING." Somebody said, "You can unhook that thing." Maybe I shouldn't unhook it. Maybe it should be all right helping me and saving my wife from getting on to me cuz it's helping me and it's helping her. Hallelujah. Amen. Ah, NO DISTRACTIONS. I'M WALKING IN THE SAME WAY HE'S GO. AND ALSO another thing, IT'S A HEARTFELT EXPERIENCE. AMEN. I WANT IT HEARTFELT THIS MORNING. AMEN. AND ONE PLACE HE SAID, "YOU HONOR, YOU DRAW NIGH TO ME WITH YOUR LIPS, BUT YOUR HEART'S FAR FROM ME." I DON'T WANT MY HEART TO BE FAR FROM HIM THIS MORNING. I WANT A HEARTFELT RELIGION. &gt;&gt; WHEN I SAY HALLELUJAH, I WANT IT TO COME FROM THE DEPTHS OF my soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The depths of my innermost being. Amen. I want a heartfelt experience. And I also want to be his friend. ABRAHAM WAS CALLED HIS FRIEND. I WANT TO BE A FRIEND OF GOD. ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I don't realize that he's right there with me to hold my hand to guide me. That's why I put my hand in his hand this morning. &gt;&gt; My time is in his hand. My hand is in his hand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything about me is in his hand this morning. &gt;&gt; That's why I want to realize that I can walk with him. Even though the days may be evil, may be corrupt, sin on every hand, but I'm still walking with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm still reading his word. I'm still praying and I keep pressing on &gt;&gt; like that sister son. I keep pressing &gt;&gt; the battle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I keep pressing on. Amen. Oh, I see this one fall. I see. But I'm keep pressing on, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I realize that he's right there with me. Another thing about Enoch's walk, he had great communication. Huh? You know, they tell me there's there's one thing that can destroy a a marriage and that's no communication. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, somebody somebody wife asked him one time said, "Honey, you never tell me you love me." He said, "I told you 30 years ago that I loved you when we got married." Said, "Hey, if it changes, I'll tell you." You know, so but what about us? I think sometimes God likes to hear him tell us hear him tell us tell him that we love him. &gt;&gt; Cuz hey, you like your husbands tell you like your husband you like for your wife to tell you. WHAT ABOUT GOD THEN YOU MULTIPLY THAT? WHAT ABOUT HIM? &gt;&gt; DID YOU TELL HIM this morning when YOU WOKE UP THAT YOU LOVED HIM? &gt;&gt; THAT YOU WAS GLAD THAT HE WOKE YOU UP. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T WAKE UP THIS MORNING. YEAH. &gt;&gt; You know, we was all recipient of miracles this morning. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; we woke up. &gt;&gt; Clothe our right mind. There's some that didn't wake up this morning. &gt;&gt; Wonder how they stood with God. But here we are today. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're still here. And I want that great I want a GREAT COMMUNICATE. GOD, HELP me in this year 2022 to have a better COMMUNICATION WITH YOU &gt;&gt; THAT I CAN TELL HIM OF MY JOY AND PRAISE. GOD, I LOVE YOU. I THANK YOU FOR HEALING ME, LORD. I THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME. I THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, LORD. &gt;&gt; I don't HAVE TO HAVE BROTHER WADE HERE. AMEN. I GOT YOU HERE, LORD. AMEN. NOT KNOCKING BROTHER WADE. AMEN. NOT KNOCKING BROTHER HOMER, ANYBODY, BUT I GOT GOD. &gt;&gt; And I want to say, God, I thank you that you woke me up. I thank you that you clothe me, Lord. I thank you, Lord, that you set my feet on another day's journey. &gt;&gt; And I'm praising you for it, Lord. I'm giving you grace for it, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm praising you for it, Lord. I'm thanking you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Tell them for joy and praise. What about our sorrow and prayer, &gt;&gt; Lord? I'm just coming to you, Lord. There's some things I don't understand. Some things that's happened, Lord, and I don't know why, Lord. This this happened. This happened. This person did this, and I don't understand, Lord. Lord, I know, Lord, that you got everything under control. &gt;&gt; And I'm asking you, Lord, to help me, oh Lord, help me to maybe understand it a little bit better, Lord. But I know one things will understand it better by and by. &gt;&gt; I just want a communication with you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Telling my sins in confession. HALLELUJAH. LORD, I CONFESS IN THIS day that I MADE A MISTAKE, LORD. I DID BAD, LORD. BUT LORD, YOU SAID THAT YOU'RE WE HAVE AN ADVOCATE WITH JESUS CHRIST, THE RIGHTEOUS. HALLELUJAH. AND HE'S A RIGHTEOUS JUDGE. &gt;&gt; He's a fair judge. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I won't confess nobody else. You know, you better watch who you confess to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Before you know it. [snorts] You know, I always used to tell me when I was growing up, three fastest ways of communication. Telegram, telephone, and tell a woman. But I put a fourth one in there. Tell a preacher. [laughter] Huh? Hallelujah. Somebody said one time they was driving down the road with somebody and somebody said, "Hey, let me tell you something about this so and so and what they did and all that." He said, "I want to tell you something. I canceled my subscription." He said, "What?" He said, "I I cancel I cancelled my subscription with a message inquire." Cuz a lot of people, that's all they want to know. WE GOT A MESSAGE INQUIRE AND THEY WANT TO KNOW THE BAD ABOUT EVERYBODY. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE GOOD? &gt;&gt; THEY WANT TO KNOW THE BAD, HOW THIS ONE FELL, THIS ONE MADE A MISTAKE, THIS ONE DID THAT, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; INSTEAD, I want to pray for everybody. &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord, to have a good communication with you. HELP ME TO CONFESS LORD to you, Lord. And then if a brother has confidence IN ME AND THEY TELL ME, "HELP ME TO TAKE IT TO THE LORD IN PRAYER." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And I don't want my walk not just be a day here, day there, but let it be every day. Not just because it's Sunday and I I got to go to church, not because IT'S WEDNESDAY, BUT EVERY DAY, &gt;&gt; seven days a week, 247. Another thing about Enoch's walk, I believe his life was progressive. You believe your life is progressive. &gt;&gt; You know a lot of things uh more about than what you did before. &gt;&gt; You know, you take uh however old the oldest one may be in here, you know, a lot more now than you did back, you know, during the day as they call it back in the day. Things are improved a lot better. You know, communication has proved a lot better. Cars have improved a lot better. A lot of things that improved a lot better. And you know a little bit about more things. And sometimes you wish you said my I wish I was younger but no more know what I know now. And is that right? I've heard that expression. &gt;&gt; Amen. But hey, his life and progressive every day he grew more and more with the Lord. THAT'S WHAT I WANT MY LIFE TO BE EVERY DAY. NOT JUST A STAND STILL BECAUSE WE STAND STILL WE BECOME STALE. &gt;&gt; BUT I want IT TO BE PROGRESSIVE EVERY DAY. LEARNING MORE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; MORE EVERY DAY ON YOUR JOB. BROTHER, I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN ON YOUR JOB, but they probably did things back then that you don't do now, but you do because they found out a better way. &gt;&gt; Made better equipment. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; How'd you look to go back to horse and buggy? I'd have to have Friday probably to get over here for today. [laughter] But now we get over here, you know, or whatever. WE JUST IMPROVING. WHAT ABOUT HEY, I WANT MY LIFE TO IMPROVE WITH GOD EVERY DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO I KNOW HOW TO WITNESS BETTER. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I know. HEY, AT ONE TIME WHEN I KNOW WHEN I FIRST COME IN THIS, HEY, WE WOULD JUST GUNGHO about everything. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You couldn't do this and you couldn't do this. you go to hell if you do this and you do this and some people young people my age are left a message and not serving God because what it just became a book of rules &gt;&gt; a book of dos and don'ts and they never did fall in love with God &gt;&gt; help us Lord I want to fall in love with him &gt;&gt; my communication be better my life be progressing amen because hey hallelujah I I I tell you one thing you just don't Oh, hey. You say, "Well, what about this? What about this? And what about this one? What about this one? What about your son? WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER? WHAT ABOUT IT? &gt;&gt; I WANT TO PRAY FOR THEM." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, WHAT ABOUT VOICE OF GOD? WHAT ABOUT THIS? I PRAY FOR THEM. &gt;&gt; I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THEY DO, BUT I WANT TO PRAY FOR HIM. I BELIEVE THE PROPHET would want me to pray for him." Right. &gt;&gt; And the other on the other hand, if he was still alive, I believe he'd be praying for my family &gt;&gt; and the needs of my life. &gt;&gt; So be vice versa. I want my life to be progressive, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So I can enjoy more. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I can understand more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have more love. &gt;&gt; I CAN ENJOY MORE. I CAN UNDERSTAND MORE. AND I CAN LOVE MORE. THEN I can receive more. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then IF I ENJOY MORE, I UNDERSTAND MORE, AND I LOVE MORE, AND I RECEIVE MORE, THEN I CAN GIVE OUT MORE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I want it to be that way. I'm walking with God. &gt;&gt; Is this all right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, I want my life to be progressive. Another thing ABOUT ENOCH'S LIFE, IT WAS A HOLY LIFE. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh, I believe his life was holy because you said he did that what was pleased God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Huh? I believe God would never walk outside the way of holiness. &gt;&gt; Do you believe the Lord has no company with the unjust and rebellious? &gt;&gt; Help us Lord help us LIVES TO BE GOD HELP WHEN THEY WALKED THERE. THEY HAD TO be dressed them priests WHEN THEY WENT BEHIND the veil. They had to be dressed, you know, the the the garment, the mantra and everything had to be DRESSED JUST RIGHT. POMEGRANT THE BELL. AND WHEN THEY WALK HOLY, HOLY UNTO THE LORD. HOLY, HOLY UNTO THE LORD. I WANT MY LIFE TO BE THAT WAY. HOLY, holy unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want my life to be that way. I want to be holy unto him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Another thing about Enoch's walk, I believe it was a happy one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, I believe he had a happy life. &gt;&gt; Don't you? &gt;&gt; And not just happy. And I I think I've said that here before. H comes from a word or happy comes from the word hap or happen. Something has to happen in order to make you happy. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You get to raise on the job, you're happy. &gt;&gt; The pastor shakes your hand, you're happy. that your favorite singer sings and you're happy. &gt;&gt; Your favorite preacher preaches and you're happy. &gt;&gt; But joy comes from a different source altogether. &gt;&gt; It comes from the creator himself. &gt;&gt; And if you don't get the raise ON THE JOB, IF THE PASTOR DON'T SHAKE YOUR HAND, if your favorite preacher ain't here preaching, Amen. If your if this AIN'T GOING ON, THIS JUST AIN'T RIGHT. YOU STILL GOT JOY. AND THE JOY OF THE LORD IS YOUR STRENGTH. SEE, HAPPINESS WHEN THINGS GO WRONG, HAPPINESS LOOKS FOR THE NEAREST EXIT. BUT JOY STANDS THERE STEADY. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So you had a HAPPY LIFE, A JOYFUL LIFE. YEAH, &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I mean, &gt;&gt; if you in the natural and you would say that, hey, listen, you're you're working for the president United States, though you may disagree with some of his policies or whatever, you know, and how everything, you know, you know, that that the weather has been kind of unusual this year, &gt;&gt; hasn't it? &gt;&gt; You know whose fault that is? Trump's. Everybody blames everything on Trump. &gt;&gt; So, it's Trump's fault. It's Trump's fault that we're in the mess we're in. It's Trump's fault that this is going on. This is going on. Everybody, you know, hey, everybody bring And today, you know, you probably say, "Man, this service is strange." Just blame it on Brother Wade cuz he invited me. Amen. But he had a happy one. And if you could walk with Trump or whatever and and beside him and and be maybe one hey you're walk BUT WHAT ABOUT WALKING with the king of kings and the lord of lords. THE BIBLE SAYS YAY THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH I WILL FEAR NO EVIL FOR THOU ART WITH ME. THY ROD AND THY STAFF THEY COMFORT ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Oh happy life. And I oh I want my walk to be like his. Another thing about Enoch's walk. It was a safe one. HALLELUJAH. IT WILL BECAUSE HEY, the Bible says, "Hey, he that dwelleth in the secret place of THE MOST HIGH SHALL ABIDE UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE ALMIGHTY." &gt;&gt; What a protection. &gt;&gt; I know sometimes, hey, we pack guns and everything, but he's our ultimate protection protector. &gt;&gt; There's something happened to me several years ago. We used in Oxford there in Alabama. We went to Chick-fil-A that morning cuz we used to where my wife worked at this daycare. We used to clean it and we had to clean it. It had to be done because it was used for Sunday school at this church because it was church affiliated. And so we was going there Saturday to clean it before Sunday. We're sitting at Chick-fil-A and eating breakfast before we went and there's two teenagers sitting in front of us. You know, nothing, you know, free country. everything. So, we get up, we're leaving, we go get our TE's refilled. They walk out the door ahead of us. We're walking behind him and they stop right there in the middle of the sidewalk and they see somebody drive up in the car and he gets out and he's walking and they go, "What in the" and they use some choice words and he had and my wife noticed one of them cuz I think one of them had some profanity written on his head or whatever and so they stopped right there. So, we kindly scooted around, went on said, "Excuse me." went toward toward the car and then my wife know that that guy that drove up. When he got out of his car, he started following us and he followed us over to our car. My wife said, "I didn't want to say nothing to David because I didn't know what he was going to do. Just followed us and and we got in the car." My wife said, "Well, we'll just get in the car. When we get in there, I'll just hit the door latches real quick." So, and our door latches, they haven't, you know, mechanical. They didn't catch. We got in there. He got in my back seat and sat down my back seat. I looked in the rearview mirror. There he was sitting on my back seat. I politely get out of my car, open the back door, and I said, "Get out. Get out." He don't say nothing to me. He just staring. He gets out and he's still staring. And then he turns and he walks across to where them other guys are and they're kind of, you know, kind of laughing. I said, "If y'all think this is funny, it's not. I didn't have my pistol with me. I was talking to somebody at church. They said, "David, you had a right. He's in your car. That's extension of your home." But I found out later that, "Hey, that's not Hey, he had to do you harm." Well, I figured him being in my car and him not invited that be, you know. But hey, he just I guess I don't know what I'd have done. He didn't do just I don't know if he's on something, just doing it for a joke or whatever. But I tell you what, I'm glad that he watches over me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. MY LIFE IS ONE OF PROTECTION BECAUSE OF HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M GLAD HE WATCHES OVER ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. ANOTHER THING ABOUT ENOCH'S WALK, IT WAS ONE OF honor to WALK WITH THE KING of Kings and the Lord of Lords. It's one of honor. Hallelujah. Remember that little girl when they gave her a flag to wave cuz a king was passing by and after after the parade was over and everything they said honey they couldn't find the little girl and the teacher got kind of beset and they went they found the girl up standing up beside a light pole just weeping said honey you all right is everything all right said didn't you see the king said oh yes I seen the king said didn't you wave your flag said oh yes I waved my flag but said I I don't know if the king seen me I'm so little I don't Oh, BUT ONE THING, GOD sees you this morning. Hallelujah. I'm glad I'm walking with him this morning. For he sees ME AND HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT ME. HE KNOWS IF I'M WAVING MY HAND THIS MORNING. HE KNOWS IF I'VE GIVEN HIM PRAISE THIS MORNING. HE KNOWS ALL about me. He sees everything that I'm doing. &gt;&gt; It's an honor to walk with him. &gt;&gt; One thing about Enoch, his life was not noteworthy. You know, sometimes just if not much is said, you know, you take a city and it grows and grows, you got a lot of crime loan going on in it and especially if it grows and all that. But, you know, Enoch, his life was short. Just didn't have much to say. &gt;&gt; Just that he walked with God. What? No. Like I said, just noteworthy. He walked with God. Hallelujah. Can you imagine who needs much details? Just that he walked with God. I don't need much details, brother Ryan. Just that I walked with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was a public man. Maybe he worked on a public job. I don't know. But he still walked with God. Like we read, hey, though the evil thoughts are evil, their their their designs were evil, their fashions were evil, their disposition was evil. &gt;&gt; Their designs were corrupt, their walk was wicked, but he still walked with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Another thing about that, HE WAS A FAMILY MAN. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said he begat Methusela, had sons and daughters, BUT HE STILL WALKED WITH GOD. I REMEMBER BROTHER HOMER TELLING me when he first came to the message and sometimes you get the tape it wasn't filtered the wheel real and it had to be you know staticky some of them was and you know and all that and said he had to wait everybody went to bed so could get quiet so he could listen but he still walked with God maybe he HAD TO GET QUIET GET ALONG BY HIMSELF JUST TO LISTEN TO GOD MAYBE BUT HE STILL WALKED WITH GOD even though he HAD A FAMILY THAT DID influence one way or the other he still walked with Amen. &gt;&gt; Let that not influence us, but let us walk with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Another thing about Enoch, Bible said he lived in an evil age. We read it what this writer wrote. It's a day of mockers and despisers where few love God and church and state WERE PROPOSING ALLIANCE. FASHION AND PLEASURE RULED THE HOUR AND UNHOLLOW COMPROMISE WAS the order of the day. &gt;&gt; But he still walked with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at it. A day of mockers and despisers. What about today? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Who few love God? Oh, they say they love God. &gt;&gt; They say they go to church. Maybe they do. And maybe to a certain extent they do say, but maybe it's just like I said earlier, they just honor them with their lips &gt;&gt; and their hearts far from it. &gt;&gt; That's right. They're just going through the motions. &gt;&gt; They're just sweeping everything under the rug, so to speak. &gt;&gt; Said Marcus despiser. Well, if you love God, church and state were proposed. What about it today? I don't know if you remember somebody sent me a a video of it last year and just only just been almost a year ago. how that when Trump became president and everything and somebody told me said well if he can get church and state together he's the man for it because you look at it and said one of the archbishops from I forget where he was from if y'all might have seen that he handed him a cross trump a cross and said he reminded him of Constantine &gt;&gt; and brother Brandon said Constantine was never perverted he said the only thing he ever done religious and paint a cross on a church or some shields and stuff that said but he got church and state ALIGNED TOGETHER. WHAT HOUR ARE WE LIVING IN CHURCH? &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; So they would propose IT AND AND FASHION AND PLEASURE RULE THE HOUR. THINK ABOUT IT. ALL PEOPLE THINK ABOUT FASHION AND PLEASURE TODAY &gt;&gt; and said unhollow compromise was ordered today. &gt;&gt; But you know what? a steerable witness because if you look at Jude 14 and 15 the scripture says in Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied to these saying behold the Lord cometh with 10 thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. One of these days they're going to come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember when he went to this preached to the souls in prison? He went to hell and preached to the souls that rejected the longsuffering of Noah. He said, "I'm the one." &gt;&gt; Listen what the prophet said. Shows the father 1964 or 54. He said, "I can see him. When he died, his soul went down to the regions of the loss. I could see him knock at the door of the lost. Somebody said, "Who is it?" Open the doors and there the mingling souls. They're in prison waiting for the day of judgment. He said, "You are to believe Enoch. You are to believe the prophets. I'm the virgin born son of God that Enoch said he'd come with 10,000 of his saints. I'm he. I'm the one and everything was written of me in my father's word. I have confirmed it." Yonder on the cross. It's finished. Close the door. That's all of it. They had to recognize. God, help us to recognize the hour AND THE AGE THAT WE'RE LIVING IN AND WALK WITH YOU, LORD. DON'T LET MY WALK COME UP SHORT, LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT LET IT BE RIGHT WITH YOU, OH GOD. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Another thing about Enoch's walk, he finished his work early. You ever finish your work early at work and they say, "Hey, you go home. You finish your work early. We'll pay you for the eight hours. You just you go home, take your little break. Hallelujah. He not finish his work early. Said it's time to come on home, son. Come on up hither. Had a testimony that he traveled faster and reached his home sooner. And you know what? He's a young man back in that day. According to you know how long did he say he lived? 300 however many years. just young man according to the day that he lived in &gt;&gt; showing to me that you young people can live that life &gt;&gt; and walk with God if he walked with it didn't compromise and the age that he was living in &gt;&gt; it was unholy full of mockers and despisers evil on every hand wickedness on every hand and he still walked with God young people you can still walk with God and you got the Holy Ghost to help you today brother &gt;&gt; Hallelujah fashion Blood cannot inherit the kingdom. He had to be translated. Hallelujah. Come up higher. Come on home. Bible says God took him. Maybe perhaps I don't know. Maybe some saw him when he left like Elijah, like Jesus. I don't know. But said God took him. Said the scripture says he was not. The Russians have cosmonauts. AMERICA HAS ASTRONAUTS, BUT GOD HAS was not. Hallelujah. AND ONE OF THESE DAYS, THIS BRIDE'S GOING TO BE A WAS NOT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT WHEN GOD'S GOING TO TAKE US OUT OF HERE, &gt;&gt; but until then, I want my walk to be close to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to be pleasing in his sight. I want it to be one of honor, one that's progressive, &gt;&gt; so I can love more, I can enjoy more, I can give out more, receive more. &gt;&gt; That's right. The Bible says he was missed. He's not found. I don't know if they look for him or not. Elijah, they look for him. 50 men of the son of prophets went out and searched. You know, true child of God, one of these days they're going to look for his brother Aaron. We're going to be gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Like my dad used to sing a song, Just Call Me Gone. You call me anything, but just call me gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One of these days, you can call me gone. We are going to get out of here. Hallelujah. I want to be ready. Hallelujah. I want to walk to be right. I want to be holy. I want to be progressive. I want to recognize in his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That Enoch's I think his departure was a testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see a lot of people going by the way. You take you know Dale different ones has gone on their walk was a testimony their departure was a testimony to those that are left behind that they left uh let's say they always say a legacy &gt;&gt; that hey how their life was lived &gt;&gt; how their life was conducted and you look at that and you said God help my life to be conducted like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe Enoch's life was a legacy to those that were left behind. Say, "Hey, if he could DO IT AND GOD TOOK HIM, MAYBE IF I COULD WALK THE SAME WAY THAT HE WALKED, &gt;&gt; THE SAME WAY, LIVE THE SAME WAY THAT HE LIVED, THAT ONE OF THESE DAYS I'M GOING TO BE CALLED GONE." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Maybe a lot of people doubted a change of body, a rapture, a reward for the righteous, but there still one of these days. Hallelujah. This old Hey, I'm gonna have a hey, new head of hair. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, ain't you looking for no more aches, no more pains, no more have to wear no more glasses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; NO MORE BACKACHCHES. NO MORE HEADACHES. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; NO GOING OVER AND LOOKING AT A CEMETERY, looking over a mountain of dirt, weeping and said, "Oh, honey, I miss you, sweetheart. I miss you." NO MORE OF THAT. WE'LL BE TOGETHER FOREVER MORE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's why I want to walk with him today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to walk with him. &gt;&gt; And let me read you some things the prophet said. That'd be all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 1954, he swore by himself. And this is what he says. And you're here to fulfill it, too. Just walk unconscious of fear. Walk unconscious of fear. He says, "Walk unconscious of criticism. We're going to get criticized. Somebody told me that well and I told somebody that said they said they want to take their and and I ain't knocking nobody. I'm just I'm just you know hey we won't have to get to you walk this walk you're going to get criticized. Hey, even when you wasn't a Christian, you was in school, if you didn't do right or whatever, people made fun of you. Like, you didn't do like maybe there was a guy that you looked up to and he did could do this and you couldn't. And maybe people knocked you because you couldn't do that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And maybe they didn't want to do it no more, but you just got to get up, dust your clothes off, and keep on doing, keep on pressing. &gt;&gt; And some people say, "Well, I you know, I got I just want to take because I got too much criticism, so I'm just going to pull all my sermons of this off the internet." And that's all RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO, THAT'S UP TO YOU. But just think, if you going to put it out there, you're going to get criticized on a lot of things. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, if it's good or if it's bad, you're still going to get criticized. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; But you got to walk UNCONSCIOUS OF FEAR. WALK UNCONSCIOUS of criticism. Walk unconscious of the world. Walk as you WALK IN CHRIST. WALK WITH HIM. NOT PAYING ANY ATTENTION to the right or left hand. Just keep moving on. If something comes up in the church, walk with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "If something comes up in the church, walk with God." He says, "Hallelujah. If sickness strikes you, walk with God. IF THE NEIGHBOR DON'T LIKE YOU, walk with God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you ain't going to please everybody. &gt;&gt; You try to please everybody all the time, you're going to wind up disappointing somebody. And maybe somebody's gonna be you &gt;&gt; because you're trying to please everybody and you can't even don't even try to please yourself and so you're gonna displease somebody. &gt;&gt; Don't Is that right? &gt;&gt; So said strike you walk with God. The neighbor don't like it walked with God. Just keep on walking with God. Enoch walked one day like that. You know what he done? He walked all the way home with God. &gt;&gt; Got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore. &gt;&gt; He says, "Amen. Walk with God. Doctor says you're going to die. Walk with God." Yeah. doctor says you well walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised you it'll I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the road and he took an oath by the covenant that he gave you that he conformed that he'd confirm it just walk with God then don't pattern yourself after somebody of the world you pattern yourself after him see him watch his LIFE DON'T ACT LIKE so and so does Sister Susie or brother Jackson or whatever it may be don't act like them. You just walk with him. Fill my way every day with love as I walk with the heavenly dove. Just stay right with him. Watch how it sweetens you and cuts all the world away. Oh my. You don't care what the people say. You're walking with God. &gt;&gt; I like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said he just walked with God. &gt;&gt; It's like a story I heard one time. These two sisters were fellowshipping together and they just talking back and forth and said, "Boy, wasn't that service good, man. Oh, brother. So and so, he just shelled the corn, didn't he?" Said, "Man, he just he just shucked it on down to the cob, didn't he?" Said, "Man, he just said, "Man, he just" and they got to talking back and forth how God's been so good. And she said, "Man, look, I got to go home. It's getting late. I got to go home." The other sister said, "Oh, don't go home. We're just having so great a time fellowshipping together. Don't go home now. I said, "I got to. I got to get home." She said, "Why don't you come walk halfway home with me, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; So, they started walking together and they started fellowshipping some more and talking about the goodness of the Lord. And that one sister said, "Look at here. What I done went done. I done walked all the way home with you." She said, "That's all right. Come on in. IT'S SUPPER TIME." HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THESE DAYS. WE'RE GOING TO WALK WITH HIM AND TALK WITH HIM AND SAID, "LORD, LOOK WHAT I DONE WENT DONE. I DONE WALKED ALL THE WAY HOME WITH YOU." HE SAID, "COME ON IN, BOY. IT'S SUPPER TIME." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Listen again. He said, "Wouldn't that be nice if you had a testimony like that, brethren? I do only that which pleases God. Wouldn't that be wonderful?" Like Enoch walked with God 500 years had a testimony. He pleased God. He didn't have to die. Just went up. So then a little afternoon noon stroll, he just started walking out and just thought, "Well, I've been on earth long enough. I'll just walk on up." And just started by faith. He thought, "Well, I've been here long enough, so I'm kind of tired of being around here. I think I'll just throw up till I hit the Milky White way and just walk on up and knock on the door." I like that. There's a song. Amen. I just keep walking, you know. Amen. Going to walk one of these days past what was it? Mars, Jupiter, you know, and all that, and catch the Milky Way way. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to walk on up home with him. Hallelujah. Amen. He said he just got started, you know. Hallelujah. Walked hit the Milky Way. Just walked on up, knocked at the door. So that's what he did. He said by faith he did it. The Bible said so. He just got started staying here. He said, "Well, I'm just going to walk up home. God just went on up through the air walking." He did that by faith. The Bible said he did. know when I feel death come knocking around my door, I don't have to. That that kind of faith, don't you? Well, so long ago, world, I'm going to walk away from you now and just start walking on. Just walk right on up and past the moon and stars. Strike the milky white way and go into the spheres and spheres out of the spheres. Just go on to glory. He said, "That's right. Amen. Just go on to glory." Again, the Easter Seal. He said, "Let's take another man with that anointing power or that quickening power." There's a man not way long ago by the name of Enoch when the new thing come along when something came along and said, "Well, just now we have to go back to the old school or this that or the other." Enoch walked with God. Whether God said do, Enoch never missed one word. &gt;&gt; I wonder if I can have a testimony like that. &gt;&gt; Whatever God says, he said he never missed one word. &gt;&gt; I want that kind of testimony. I want that kind of walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 2026. I don't know about tomorrow, but I know who holds my hand. &gt;&gt; If I put my hand in his hand, I can walk &gt;&gt; like Enoch walked. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can pray like Daniel prayed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can dance like David. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When the spirit falls upon me, &gt;&gt; I'll dance like David. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I walk like he not walked. I pray like Daniel prayed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Since when one time he he said he said he not walk with God whatever God said he never missed one word with God. What was he? He was a son of God. He was an eagle that had been called to that day. Aren't you glad that you're eagle &gt;&gt; that been called to this day? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what brother said in one place I think it's be certain of God. Forget what year just now. He said you know why that Enoch or Elijah came to that widow woman? cuz she was of the same caliber as Elijah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you know why you heard the message of the hour? You was of the same caliber as Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NO, GOD HELP IT. THANK YOU, LORD. THAT'S OF THE SAME CALIBER AS MALACHI 4. &gt;&gt; YES, &gt;&gt; he called you. He might [clears throat] not called your brother. He might not called your mama, but he called you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank God. We might not understand that, but oh, I thank God. Anyhow, &gt;&gt; I pray for my family. I pray for them. Amen. I just And some of them, they believe they're all they're all right, maybe or whatever. Maybe you got some that, hey, they think they're all right and they're just deceived as deceived can be. But I thank God that he'd open my eyes that I could see, that I could walk with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Again, he says, "Son of God, he'd been eagle. When it come time, he was so full of that quick power. remember he had walked 500 years or more before God. Not one time had he missed his word. Not one time did he misbehave himself. Woo. You know, I think he was looking through the blood cuz hey, you said, "Hey, he cried." But hey, he knew that he was going to come and die on the cross, &gt;&gt; huh? All that spoke of him coming everything. And when when Abel did what he did and sue that, it was speaking of that sacrifice to come, that supreme sacrifice to come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. I'm so glad. Hey, he we sang that song. He was looking through the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I'm glad. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glad that he loves me. Glad that he takes care of me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Said he never missed his word. Never did misbehave himself. Not one time did he do that. But kept this testimony. Oh, hallelujah. One of these days when you get over there, all the devil wants to point out your mistakes and everything. But the Bible says over there, you over there in Romans around the 8th chapter, therefore there's no condemnation to them that live in who are in Christ Jesus goes on to say, him he called, he justified. Those he justified, he glorified. Who could lay charge against God's elect? God forbid any man would try to lay charge. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; And if you and if you ask God for forgiveness, you know what he does? He drops it in the sea of forgiveness under in that bleached water of his blood. Hallelujah. never to be remembered no more. Hallelujah. And the devil wants to break. God says, "What's sin?" Hallelujah. What sin? Hallelujah. Uhhuh. I'm looking at a spot, spotless, UH, UNADULTERATED, VIRTUOUS BRIDE OF CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; Never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What a testimony. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said it's what he do. Slipped that on that. He said, "What a thanksgiving." He slipped that wedding bag of unmmerited grace. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If I had $500 in my pocket and I said, "Aaron, here it's yours. Come get it." And he came and got it, it was his cuz I gave it to him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to work for it. &gt;&gt; He said, "Brother David, can I come mow your grass?" No, I gave it to you. Can I do this? Can I do something? No, I gave it to him. That's grace. &gt;&gt; He didn't do nothing to earn it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You ever been pulled over by a cop, policeman, and he says, "You know what? I already give you a ticket cuz you know what and you know what you're doing. Like somebody said because the first thing he said, "Do you know why I pulled you over?" And you go, "Hey, you know why he pulled you over?" &gt;&gt; He said, "I already give you a ticket." But she says, "I'm going to let you go." That's mercy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Something that you deserved because you done something wrong, but he granted you mercy. &gt;&gt; We were all born in sin. Satan in iniquity. Come to the world speaking lies. Amen. &gt;&gt; But God gave us mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; I want to walk with God then. &gt;&gt; Want to walk with him. Don't you said he was just full. He said he just wanted everything. God, he just wouldn't done it. No matter what he done, no matter what anybody else thought, he went done it. Why? He was full of that quickening empire. It come time for that old man to die. God just sit down a ladder and walked up and walked up home. He quickened him and took his mortal body up in the rapture. Amen. That's quickening power. Thank you, Jesus. He said, "That's quickening power." Amen. You believe that one more &gt;&gt; one more quote and I'll read it to you and we'll let you go. Listen what he says. 1956, father, the hour has come. And now Jehoshaphat his son recognizing he takes his place had a good background to look upon to see what a man will he said to see that and so he said so when a man will walk for God he said Ofat he said he's raising up taking his place you know taking his place had a good background to look upon to see that he said now when a man will walk for God and walk with God, God will walk with that man. &gt;&gt; They said when a man will walk with God and for God, God will walk with that man. But when that same individual turns his back from God, then God just lets him shift for himself. And we find out it is very sad thing when we have to shift for ourselves. So when a man will walk for God and with God, &gt;&gt; God will walk with that man. But when that same man turns his back and walks away from God, then God let them just shift for himself. &gt;&gt; I mean, wants to shift for themselves this morning. &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to shift for theirelves. &gt;&gt; I get enough trouble trying to, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; without with him without shifting for myself. &gt;&gt; Let us walk with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stand together. God bless you this morning. Happy New Year to you. Won't [applause] we just bow our head? Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, just kind of Lord, maybe shotgun this morning. I don't know, Lord. Only you know, Father. And Lord Jesus, I just want to say that I love you and I appreciate you so much, Lord Jesus. I appreciate you for allowing me to be able to come and fellowship with brothers and sisters of my precious faith, Lord. And Lord, I appreciate you allowing me to speak what was on my heart, Lord Jesus. And Father, Lord, I'm going to be held accountable for what I spoke this morning, Lord, if I don't walk for you. Cuz Lord, that last quote Lord, he said, "When a man will walk for God and with God, then God will walk with that man." Said, "But when that same individual turns his back on God, then God will just let him shift for himself." God, I don't want to shift for myself this morning, but I want you walking with me, Lord. Let my walk be like Enoch's, Lord. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; That'll be like Noah's father and just man, but he walked with you in the hour of criticism, the hour of unholiness. Cuz even in your scripture, Lord, you said that people got so wicked, their very thoughts, their very imaginations, everything was wicked about them. But yet [music] Enoch walked with you. Noah walked with you. Lord, when we're living in this hour where you say that as it was in the days of Noah, shall shall it be. Lord, as it was in the days [music] of Sodom, so shall it be. Lord, we see it all around us. Sodom, all around us, Lord. We see all these things, Lord. Building on every hand like there's not going to be a tomorrow. Lord, just doing this and doing this, Lord, and all that, Lord. But yet, Lord, you got a people that will [music] walk with you. And Father, their walk will be one that's Lord, that's pleasing to you, Lord. I believe you got a people that their walk will be pleasing to you, Lord. [music] Not only that, but their walk is a holy one, Lord. Their walk is a happy one, Lord, cuz they're walking with you. Their walk is one that's progressive, Lord, cuz Lord, they they they're understanding more. They're enjoying more. They're loving more. They're receiving more, and therefore they can give out more, Lord. Father, there there there's one that they got a a life that's protected by the Almighty God. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord. No matter what comes or goes, we're under the shelter of your arm. [music] Thank you, Father. You're protecting us, Lord. We're thanking you for that, Lord. Help us to walk with you, Lord. Father, a lot of us, Lord, nearly all of us probably, I'd be safe to say that we didn't think we'd ever reach this 2026, but we're here. We are, Lord, still fighting the greatest battle ever fought. But, Father, you're going to have a people that's going to walk with you, Lord. Father, whether I walk with you or not, they're still going to have somebody that walks with you. Lord, you [music] said in your word, you're going to have a church that's without spart or wrinkle. Whether I'm a part of it or not, you're still going to have a church. You said you're going to have a bride. Whether I'm a part of that bride or not, you're still going to have a bride. Now, Lord, you're going to still have somebody that walks with you in this evil age that we're living in. Whether I walk with you or not, Lord, just let me walk with you. Then, if you're going to have somebody to walk with you, let me walk with you. If you're going to have a bride, Lord, let me be a part of it, Father. Help me, Lord, in my walk, Lord. Lord, as we see in this late hour that we're living in, Lord, and Father, we just don't know when, Lord, it may be all over with. But until then, let us keep pressing the battle, Lord. Let us keep fighting the good fight of faith, Lord. Let us keep pressing on, Lord Jesus. And Lord, surely one of these days when we're sitting around that throne, Lord, sitting around that table thousands of miles long, Lord, there's a prophet so beautifully described it. Tears streaming down our face, Lord, we can look over at one another, Lord. [music] Battle scarred veterans. I don't know, maybe me and Brother Aaron, whoever it be, we sit across from one another and we look at each other said, "Brother David, we made it." And I said, "Yes, sir, brother." And we made it. Maybe with our wives, our families. I don't know how we'd be sitting, Lord. But then you'll come out, Lord. Take your fingers and wipe the tears from her eyes and it's all over. You don't have to cry no more. Just enter into the joys of the Lord that's prepared for you before [music] the foundation of the world. Father, until then, may I keep walking with you, Lord. May I keep pressing, Lord. Lord, help every one of these that's under the sound of my voice. Keep [music] pressing. Keep walking. Father, grant it. Lord, if there's somebody that's sick here in the building they need prayer for, we'd be glad to pray for them before we leave. [music] Lord, whatever. Father, we just ask, Lord, that you minister to each and everyone. Be with your people, Lord. be with brother Wade, Lord Hunting, different things, Lord. Different ones, different meetings they announce, Lord, [music] different things, different ones that are sick, Lord, back home in our church, Lord. Our pastor, but different ones, Lord, just be with each and every one. Lord, [music] many sick among us, many afflicted, Lord, you said many of the afflictions of the righteous, but Lord, you're the one that delivers [music] us out of them all. Thank you, Lord. May we walk with you. Until then, we just ask Lord that you [music] keep us safe. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless you this morning. Hallelujah. I give you honor. Give you [music] [singing] praise. You are the &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the truth, the way. I bless your name. [music] I bless your name.

Defy those chains. means they'll fall right off. The word's [music] been sent to you to deliver you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Just just a simple faith. You know, we set our alarm clocks this last night believing they were going to go off, get up this morning. We got up, went to the sink or whatever, turned the water on, turned the shower on. We expected water. It came. It was there. We got in the car, put the key in, cranked it up. We expected it to run. It ran. &gt;&gt; We just expected it. What? Because we've been through it before. We've seen it happen before. That's right. &gt;&gt; Childlike [music] faith. Just simple faith. Unconscious faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, God's the same way. He's brought us through time and time and time again. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's the same simple faith. just to believe and all you got to do is believe it and God will come on the scene and you can have the same testimony Enoch had. You please God. He wants you to take him at his word. Believe his word. If you're sick this morning, you don't have to carry it out the door with you. &gt;&gt; You can leave it right here. If you got if you've got questions in your mind, whatever it is you you seek the Holy Ghost, whatever it is, you can put it right down right here. You can leave here with whatever you have need of, whatever you desire. You don't have to wait till later or some other time. No, he's right here this morning to give it to you.
