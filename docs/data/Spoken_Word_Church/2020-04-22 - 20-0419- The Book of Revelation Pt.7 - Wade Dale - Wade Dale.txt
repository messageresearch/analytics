========================================

okay bless each and every one of you all of y'all the whole huge mental people we got in here there's a throw back of man be careful six-foot distance thing we got to keep this thing now and keep this thing going in the right direction Yeah right so Lord bless chip we're going to start today again on the book of Revelation thank you all for tuning in and being patient until this thing gets to where they start releasing a little bit of everybody start doing right maybe in another month we can get 50 people in here the way they're talking about something so let's just people with each other prayers keep our jewel and prayer he had a stroke Friday I guess it was and he's doing a whole lot better than I said in the hospital but he's still got to go through therapy and then also colleagues stepbrothers got the virus down in Atlanta so don't even remember there so so now we were we were back here and Sarvis talking about the sardian Church age which would be the church age of Martin Luther and how we come up through justification and we show down each characteristics of each age has to fit the messenger has to fit that page and also the people and the message have to fit what's going on because because God wrote this and for us to read and now the people of Philadelphia Church J's probably around John Wesley's time I don't know that they read the Bible which the Bible was beginning to come out then in Luther's day Wesley the Bible was pretty much already written King James Version and all that and it was distributed for them to read but I don't know that the people sitting in his and only north if John Wesley knew he was that angel but because of the profit cone in the end time in looking back to that and God showing him who eats angel was alright he could say that was John Wesley then when we look at the message that John Wesley preached we see that it fits perfectly same way went back here in the sardian Church age four Luther coming out of the countless churches protesting the Catholic Church starting the Protestant movement and then it moves over into the Wesleyan movement or the Methodist movement and just to give you a little background by John Wesley is the reason they're called Methodist is because they have a method of worship I would say Martin Luther probably brought a little more Catholicism in because he didn't he didn't come all the way out of the Catholic Church but he did come to a place where the just shall live by faith and he was real happy about that so then you can know you can see that when John Wesley comes in John Wesley so you can't be you could be Martin Luther and smoke a pipe and drink a beer hmm of course that sounds horrible with us but you got to remember Germans even now Germans drink beer like we drink tea they drink it with their meal they drink it warm they drink it all the time and it really doesn't make them inebriated because they're so much used to it same with Italy Italy drinks a lot of wine so it's just that we take it to the things that happen to us that we shouldn't do this attached to it so Martin Luther was used to doing these things but now God revealed to him to just shall live by faith and that was what God was happy with it moment he wasn't happy with the drinking in there smoking but he was happy with what he had at the time yeah cut in you Martin Luther had you know this much like then John Wesley's got this much life so when John Wesley comes on the scene God gives him a revelation of holiness all right and I met that of worship if you take if you find you an old Methodist if you go to Methodist Church don't still there but no still there in book but if you'll read in it it'll tell you all about John Wesley and all about the method of worship hounding you're supposed to come in and and you know you do this and then you do this and then you take up the offering just like what brother Brandon would tell us to do basically in this time but he was beginning Andrew John Wesley to show sanctification which is cleaned and set aside for service for us but it was his baptism of the Holy Ghost that he could see that those things were going out of his life nobody nothing and also this movement is going to brand another thing it's going to bring the great missionary age where they go out because Martin Luther what much in missionary they kind of stayed right there in Germany they're done but now you've got John Wesley which is he's in angel and I would assume and then he goes and he actually sails to Georgia if you read your history for over Fork it's where he landed and there was a fort there so being named 404 and he was going to go there to take the Indians the creeks and the Creek Indians and the turkey and all the different Indians he was going to go over there and missionary to them but on his way over there they got caught a storm and all these things happen but he saw a group of people called the Moravians and they were didn't bother them they were like you know they were backing the boat praying and worshiping the Lord and he kind of got attached to that now you don't hear a lot about the Marine Ian's after that because it wasn't that one the movement of God at the time the movement of God was in John Wesley's but he had to come through just like we're talking about upstairs John Wesley had to come through a journey he had to come all the way over here to Georgia to learn that he was born again yeah he had to get back in that boat go back to England and found God over there in England got born again and then he started proclaiming his message so but what happened though look how you moved it was then it was considered the great missionary age there was a lot of missionaries come from John Wesley and the Wesleyan movement or the Methodist movement comes everything back to the worship now you and you come into church and you knew how to worship and that's saying where we met this you go to every Methodist Church and usually they're basically the same but then what happened before we read this what happened what happened in every age God said this is why I want you to do and they said okay we'll do this but now remember God says plus because God keeps moving right so the Methodists in like the Lutheran said this is it we're not going in for the week we don't believe that Methodist movement we're still going to do what our leader said which in part they were true but their attitude was they had it off so the measure that's the same way even when when when John Wesley went off the same therein and the church identity in about 1906 no he died way back before then but that movement continued on and then they became so stomped and so met methodological methodical methodical photographer thank you methodical in their worship then it became the Catholic Church you know you walk in you do your time you do your hell marries you so they walk in they sang three songs they had taken up the offering the preacher preaches a sermon they have an altar call and that's that cigar said there's more to it than this yes so I'm gonna move on you can stay there I am with you to this degree right here right here but now when you move when when I'm moving on to the next phase when I'm moving to the next phase you're not moving but remember don't ever forget God was truly pleased and John Wesley Marlon's and all these people right here had the same baptism of all of those did you know yes excuse me the same baptism Holy Ghost Paul hey it was just degrees that each one took the Word of God and they like I said before you know John Wesley or Martin Luther the just shall live by faith that was a great thing because you know what you got to be the same way you got to adjust or the justified you not have to live by faith when we begin our Christian journey and even to the end of our Christian journey we still gotta have faith still so the faith doesn't leave and then when Martin Luther looked at that and said the just shall live by faith he told his people we gotta start living by faith forget about what the Catholic Church says about penance and doing these novenas and praying the dead Saints we got Jesus Christ we need to pray to and we got all these things that he brought him out of but he didn't bring him when he came out though he brought remember with somebody he got a name that you live in mind but you're dead he continued to bring the Father Son Holy Ghost baptism and all these different things he kept bringing him whipped they all kept bringing him with him God didn't like that but God's got grace knowing that this end time would come and that we could look back and build off of that same way with Abraham Abram made a lot of mistakes Abraham made some mistake and you and I gonna make some mistakes yeah but it's the journey that we're in in the continuation of the journey we'll talk about it at home see afternoon so let's get into this and to the angel and that word angel means messenger and to the messenger the church in Philadelphia right now look this is not Philadelphia Pennsylvania okay this is not Philadelphia Pennsylvania this is the church ik Philip I love our over in Asia there was a place called Philadelphia you'll read your turkey hook you'll know that these things that he that is holy now today remember he's required them how to be holy he's requiring us to be holy he's required in Abraham's journey and sanctification to become more holy than he was when he first started same way with you and I he that is true he even have to qiyam David he that openeth the no man shutteth and shutteth the no man openeth brother ground talks about this being that open door I know that works behold I have set before thee an open door now what is that open door that open door was is that gone open the door to the world because he we got to well let's just be truthful Columba probably spent ninety nine percent of his time on one island in one nation yeah so there wasn't a lot of missionary work going out during this time wasn't here went here maybe a little bit more with Paul but Martin Luther a little bit more with John Wesley you come up you got more horses carriages he's heck we're heading into them to the age of big boats cars airplanes now still one thing so people Commission anymore I mean you can talk about the trip that that Luther took I mean Wesley took to America was it took like a month almost to get there yeah Dave I mean like three weeks to get to America from England on both but god help man make better boats engines became in here engines intro diesel gas powered engines so what he does is he opened the door to the world and I just want to say this not belittling Martin Luther but Martin Luther's message to the world would work yeah because it was real it's kind of loose you know I said okay to do this but when you take jar Leslie when God sent him out John Wesley was looking you've got to be holy we got a dress right we don't need to be drinking alcohol we don't need to be smoking we need just straighten ourselves up and be riding and trying to live the best play with cam because he quotes scripture God won't dwell on an unclean vessel any man that put something in their body your body's a temple of the Holy Ghost and whatever you put in it that's what you get out of it right yes talk to me that would have been better ran out into the world because you're trying to convert and and I starts planning this perfect he knew that that's what is gonna be perfect so I know that works behold that set before thee an open door no man can shut it so no man came in and shut the door except when they started making creeds and dogmas they shut the door yeah they didn't shut gods door to the nation's no and it was still open that has the little strength but a little more holiness a little more closer to walk with God and has kept my word so he's coming more toward the Word of God like I said we're we're John Wesley could read that he even I think it's misrepresented sometimes the people say coffee but if you'll look back he was an Englishman so they drank tea and they said T he had all these different good properties and all that stuff John Wesley's like y'all are spending hours a day sitting around drinking tea when it has no value to it now he didn't say it didn't have any nutritional value they would just sit around drinking their tea in other words they weren't worshipping God they trying to you know trying to have these social events and everybody gets round drinking tea and don't talk about the work of God he wanted to talk about the work of God I don't think it was the physical teeth or the physical coffee it's what time you do with it right yes I drink coffee all day but do I just sit down for an hour and just drink coffee don't think about nothing else you know that that's the way I look at because you have a little strength and have kept my word and that's not denied my name so they still believe it in the Lord Jesus Christ but they are remember they are still they are still baptizing in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost come they don't know any better they're still taking a Trinitarian doctrine to the world but you know what I'm going to say this God's ok with that in that time yeah he's not ok with it now because the full words been over because the memory says has kept my word it has not denied my name behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not but do lie or in other words say they are Christians and or 9 in do lie I have someone who gets them behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet because what's going to happen in Martin Luther's time or John Wesley's time here's what we're talking about you see these people now they physically do that but you see when the end time comes and all these people are brought up in judgment there's going to be a group of people in John Wesley's time just gonna reject that head rejected his message and they're gonna have to bow down same way with all of us they're gonna difficult bow down to the bride the brides when it does the judging right and to know that I have loved thee he loved them they could have loved him but he's going to show the separation I love Martin Luther John Wesley I love you people and I gave you the new birth you have faith but there's a group of people that didn't believe it cuz you got all your fanaticism and everything even in the message you got from that material cuz look look he says because now that's kept the word of my patience so John Wesley is bringing a little more of the word to light cuz now you got an imprint form and they can sit and talk about the Bible ain't not just what they were depending on a long time ago journey during the Columbus time if the priests would come up in a Catholic Church and he'd speak Latin he would read out of the Latin Vulgate which was the Bible that you didn't understand and there was no interpretation whatever they said that's what you did so Martin Luther that's when he started pulling the last and now that's not exactly the way it's supposed to be so when the Bible's began to be printed man could look down with their own eyes and read the Bible and keep the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation in other words with an hour of what on the hour of trial which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth now remember as they don't prove this a missionary age then it's not just England not just gobbling it's not just Ireland it's not just Germany it's not just were these three messengers work now God has sent these messengers out into the world yeah so the whole world I'm sorry there's going to be a group of people the great tempter the God attempts you its sample and it tempted them we shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth it's gonna try me in you just like it tried them behold I come quickly hold that fast which you got in other words whatever you got hang on to it yes whatever you got hey whom did that no man take thy crown him that overcometh while I'll make a pillar that's not a pillow that's a pillar you know killer if this is the pillar this is help holding the building up so the people were help holding the Word of God are the temple of God where's the temple of God not great mortar and stone right here's the temple of God so in other words the way I see it John Wesley was more staunch in the Word of God and he told the line and as the Bible brother Graham quotes many times about him being a firebrand snack stout over the fire no words he was a hot coal he was a fireball he preached I can't remember you read it there it's phenomenal amount of sermons he preached in his lifetime he would preach six sermons a day because he'd get on his horse and he'd go preaching this town he'd get on his horse to go preach in that town or he could go from that time to another town why because it's the missionary age and remember the one time when the horse broke his leg you you were supposed to kill a horse if it breaks his leg he can't get over cuz there's so much lately but he gets down praise for the horse knows you can't walk where he's going you've done a desperate situation he said God I need you to heal this horse and he just spoke to the horse and horse stood up he jumped on it and rode it for ever and ever again but that was God showing that he was making the first Martin Luther first John Wesley and then everybody behind that he was making them pillars in the temple of my diamond and he showed go a little more out and I will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem not Jerusalem over them physical Jerusalem overseas the New Jerusalem what is the New Jerusalem is a mother of a solace a new city that we have that Abraham was looking for but not the physical city which coming down out of heaven because though Jerusalem over there didn't come down out of heaven but the new cities gonna come down out of heaven Court revelation 22 22 in there from my god and I will write upon him my new name what Christian whatever you want to call you you know people probably a new name I don't worry about that I've got a new name Abraham guy a new name Avram got a new names Abraham all right you got a new name from Center to Christian all right so I'm not worried about what we're gonna be called over there because you know what when we go through the glorified body our brains will be unlimited and we'll be able to know each other Bible says as we are so I'm not worried about that I got to get to that new name first yes I believe the new names you got to get up in there so you're you're they couldn't reach it because he said I will write upon him my new name right so let's let the I do it let's take the I am write that name for us right he do have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches that says he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says into the churches because see we have to take Martin Luther plus we have to take John Wesley Plus everybody got that now we're down here the Laodicean Church age we've got to take that levenshtein Church age plus because there's a group of people come out because remember brother man said and bride was never in an age right so but they got the characteristics of the age because that's what God wrote about and the messenger but here we go now and we're going to read this and then we'll we'll do that next Sunday we'll go on upstairs into the angel or messenger of the Church of the loudest and write these things saith the Amen hello this is coming to the finality there's no more Church agent right don't want to change that to this one the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God now just give you a little background on that the begin God never had a beginning God never was a creation he was a creator but the beginning of the creation of God yes if I got that you read it like that the beginning of the creation of God all right now what is that begin the creatives and well that was way back in Derwin that was okay because that was temporary back in Genesis 1 God said let there be light but Genesis 1:26 was the creation of God yes our the unfolding of God men come if you look at that word creation you think creation means and there's a table I mean there's a something standing around here beside me no this table is the creation from a tree that was back in the original creation that's why the Bible says there's nothing new Under the Sun anything you see how care if it's this computer or this phone it comes from the dirt and minerals of this ground yeah so this is a creation of God but now it only developed how many years ago maybe 30 years ago with them at them maybe 20 years ago really and the iPhones only like the thing you're going maybe you're 18 years old from what that it was always here in the dirt somewhere you were always there in the dirt somewhere your house did you live in was always in the trees and in the plastic and all the other things but then what did man do man created an automobile automobile was always here it was just parks laying all over the world and man being a miniature God put all these things together and created an automobile well that's at the beginning of the creation of God why is this to begin in creation God brother Brown said Jesus Christ was the beginning of the creation of God why because God always wanted to be a man but one happened in the Garden of Eden God couldn't become flesh right then that's a baby now eat now we're gonna talk about mail carrier day this afternoon that wasn't the son of man that wasn't Jesus Christ in human flesh at that point yeah that was God getting just some elements of the earth putting it over his theophany but we needed a kinsman we needed somebody to go back to that Genesis 1:26 and save that man yes so we needed God in human flesh to begin the creation of God to do that so just think that in your mind we'll go love genesis 1:26 and that's where it comes up right here in our teaching so it's 9:57 let's go ahead and go upstairs okay
