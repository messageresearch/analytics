men but a good to see each one fret to the Lord would bless and guide us all in the grace of his love all right now remember the brother and I don't know what his name is did brother Louise never did give me he told me his name but that's that's gone you know but anyhow he's a brother supposed to be with us Wednesday night ministering far so you know pressure Lord would bless him and all in them to remember the announcements that Terrance has made and all and keep everything in your hearts in mine all right for the next month we'll be running and having different ministers in and different things or some preaching virus and Happiness so you know present Lord replace if you'd like turning these scriptures turn to James 5 into Jeremiah 3 James 5 in Jeremiah 3 we've been in kind of a little salt pattern for the last three messages we'll try to wind it up today on this of the former and latter rain and finish or we can have a better understanding so there's anything else that we missed remember brother Luiz and it was down in Baikonur brother Yancy's in time so remember those okay father we thank you for your grace and your lovin to each and every one of us thank you for understanding thank you for life and truth and we pray that you would just bless us Lord and keep us in your grace because your grace is truly sufficient that's the one thing we desire more than anything works and ideas and thoughts are wonderful but lord your grace is the thing that we cry out for have your way with each and every one of those best those that are not here remember the sick ones remember brother al their Lord and His problems and things and remember sister John in and brother Doherty Lord being sick remember all the others that are sick among us you said you sent your word and healed us so then we send the Holy Spirit guys to these that Lord that are sick and we ask you to just heal each and every one have your way bless us together in your loving grace in Jesus name James 5 and then we'll go to Jeremiah 3 says be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the Lord now what's this talking about the coming of the Lord well is that simple enough to where we can just read it and as the old saying goes third grade reading that we can read it toward it it says unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman which is Almighty God waited for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain now that's not you read that now read it but with understanding the husbandmen at Almighty God he's waiting on you and I right he's waiting on you and I he's not waiting on his self it's already finished as far as he's concerned he's waiting on you and I what for how patience until he received the former and latter rain he who the church I the also patient stablish your heart for the coming of the Lord draw it now all right now let's go back to where we were on the other night in there the other day by Sunday and Wednesday whatever to Jeremiah I want to make sure and get this point in where we can see the real truth of the day that we're living Jeremiah 3 verse 2 lift up thine eyes unto the high places and see where thou has not been lain with in the ways has thou set for them as the arabian in the wilderness and thou hast polluted the land with our whoredoms and with our wickedness therefore the showers have been withholding and there has been no latter rain and thou hast a horse for head I refuse us to be ashamed you may be seated will we leave all first for now we've been talking of former and latter rain and we tried to review a lot this past Wednesday and I hope you'll listen to it and try to understand what we're talking about I ask you to listen to what I'm saying I don't ask you to believe what I'm saying I've never asked anyone to believe what I say if my word is not good enough you know and you'd say well I don't believe you within you're doubting my word you're doubting my whole personality my being of what I am and everything and I've never tried to make anybody believe anything my family or anybody I just want to preach the truth you know as much as I know and stay with that and then let you decide what the rest of it is for your own experience because I can't reveal anything to you all right no men mr. can reveal anything to you brother branham couldn't reveal anything to you all right now jesus said even his own life didn't reveal it it's the father that's the revealer of the word all right so then we have to depend upon the Holy Ghost to reveal and make known all right now what was we talking about former and latter rain there's many instances in the Bible like we went through John introducing Jesus see John's message the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world was the former rain because it was a planting rain or a ministering or preaching all right and then the Lord Jesus when he stepped out Darcy he was that Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he was the latter rain - what John had spoken because he was the production as we'd call it of what John had said in his message well I just always remember that all the way through the Bible and keep it to her that you've got a prophet brings a message all right then there's a people to take that message and make it alive all right then when you make it alive then it is the latter rain - what you're speaking you don't have to just have in our thoughts a long time run maybe former rain back yonder latter rain over here remember it's always anytime you have a sewing rain or the Word of God being planted you're coming into a former rain all right no a teaching rain and then when that is made alive you have the latter rain all right because that's the word made alive in your heart okay see the in the Lord Jesus as I said preached his message dr. Matthew Mark Luke and John that was the former rain all right then when it was quickened on the day of Pentecost to the disciples it became the latter rain are the quickening making alive of that word and there was a harvest of the message that the the Lord Jesus had preached the harvest was there in the book of Acts and you seen them as he come through the end we went through the ages and and all is to try to run a PHY step to a rat then we went through the ages bringing it down to where Paul preached to the first church age and see his message was the former right are the teaching reign you know he brought a message all right then the people became that message okay and that's so is it in each age that a messenger comes to bring the message all right then as the messenger brings the message when God makes that alive or gives understanding opens the word alright to the people and they become that message there is the latter rain are the quickening coming to a harvest rain you know we'd call it because in the you know in the natural we know the story you go out and you plant your garden well you've got to have moisture you got to have former rain to fall on it are poured on yourself all right we see then one day you harvest what is in that field that's brought forth remember my points been trying to get you to see the rain doesn't change the seed the seed is the seed whatever seat it is it just moisturizes that seed to where the seed props forth in life it doesn't change it from a coke over to wheat that doesn't work now I admit we were a bunch of coke averse I admit that now and you know you and I were a bunch of cuckoo birds as far as the gospel is concerned because that's Gentiles we were just heathen you know running around with clubs on her back no promises in the Bible no nothing you know just a bunch of heathen people living in a world that had no rights to God whatsoever but God made a way and thank God for that like I've always said you know we talk about the African people and say well well there're Africans and there's this wife this group will hear that and then we call ourselves Americans and we say we're Caucasian well I say we're a concoction because that makes none of us worth anything it doesn't matter what the color of the skin or whatever it is there's no difference in it you can give me a blood transfusion I can give you one all right that doesn't change anything on that it just brings forth whatever it is so that's the main thing now what is it see then as we come to Feist run-up to Iraq see when brother Branham then came and brought his message we have it in tapes and books we have it on the computers we have it on everything of the message that the Prophet brought all right now that message he brought is a former rain a teaching rain so he went forth and told his message all right now when the people make that message alive then you'll see the latter right all right because that is what's making it alive is the rain that's that's the thing that's taking place and that's what I'm trying to get you to see that maybe we're looking for things that we shouldn't look for all right and then we'll complain or gripe or say well why ain't God among us now I quote the Prophet he said the very spirit you used daily to overcome no we'll just live it's the same holy spirit that was under those foxes Book of Martyrs of all those people dying giving their lives for the gospel it's the same Holy Ghost in every age it's according to the people all right and see if we believe that we're the last day people then there's not another message to come all right it's the final message and the bride becomes as we were bringing the other day what the prophets say under her messenger she will be the final voice to the final age right under her messenger what are you saying by bringing his message or trying to make that message alive you know make it a living message it was never meant to just be coming and condemn organizations that wasn't what the message come for the message come to make the bride alive you know to take us out of here on a rapture in faith lacework in the books and tapes or in other words in the message because what are you looking for who are you looking for something to come alright but now as I said we read here that's even as the point to make sure that we if we don't bring that seed in sighs this for a second if we don't bring that seed pure and unadulterated then God cannot make it alive for what he wants right I mean you know what what are you expecting what are you expecting in this day well we're this where that with is where we're in bad shape like I said the spirits you use daily to overcome is the very holy spirit that fell on the church in the beginning the heels of sick raise the dead it's the same holy spirit all right season why don't we believe it that away and say thank you Lord now bring the message and let us be what we're supposed to be and we read their word the Prophet said after the door the Gentile church is closed he said he would have known a church then and God would do in one year one theology or theologians tried to do in 2000 but said he's doing it now that was the 1954 see anytime you have the word being revealed to you there is your quickening power right all right when the word is made alive that's the quickening power and like I said to ending up the message there Wednesday see when you receive the new birth all right you can't lose that nuber right now I said new birth I didn't say our ideas or make a statement or claim to believe that but we'll get to that in a minute and you look at what's falling apart around the the message people you know all right we'll get to that in a minute in in the message but I want you to get this point see the day you receive that new birth that rapture was put inside of you brother Branham says your resurrection is in your spirit now that's not that that's not in your file sensitive spirit because everybody has that it's in your spirit that's within you that's the Holy Spirit in your soul that's made alive in you all right now God ain't gonna come and take away all of the bride and leave one if you've got Jim if you have the genuine new birth your rats are started that minute one because look what happened to you the Bible says we are resurrected and sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus is that right we'll see then your rights are already started right there in your resurrection started there it's just having to wait until the time that it's finishing it up and we've got the form of rain we've got the message the Prophet brought all we got to do is study that message until we become that message all right and brother Branham said it like this now he said it he said if you're truly born again that Holy Spirit is sitting in your soul waiting a lot waiting on you to bring him the word right he's waiting on you to bring him the word that he can make alive back out to you I mean that's the simplicity of it why should we worry about anything else then just rest in him and and be happy you know because that's that's what we're we were promised to do in the last days all right but then we we took over that said James and James is specifically explaining that God is waiting on you and I now brethren says this on the message I think it's adoption he said God's waiting on you and I he said adoption time when he can pour in his spirit his fullness and time into you and I and take us in a rapture you mean God's waiting on us yeah yeah he's waiting on you and me he don't have to but he did promise he would I like that don't you and as he promised that he would come and take us out of this chaos all right then what did the Prophet say only what is it god of this evil age he said the bride is to prove to Satan that she won't fall like Eve did all right this you're simply taking the message then you know I mean I all we gotta do is take the message and when I got one Bible we're gonna get that in a minute worth it over here so I'll split up in mankind until what it's wound up to be but still if there's just one Bible I don't see one that is so many denominations I didn't understand that when I was in the Baptist Church I thought why is there so many different denominations and we've got one Bible we'll see I didn't know nothing about a prophet or anything then I was just serious minded in thinking we've got one message why is there so many splits and all kind of things in the message of the hour that we call now I'll say this one thing to you straight there is no problem with the message the message is right you can put your heart on the message but now a lot of our interpretations we'll get to in a minute that's what's killing us all right we see God is waiting on you and I to step forth as we were talking last night you know in the Bible study of praying and things God is waiting on you and I to call him on the scene and as I covered in the ages and the what did the Prophet say happened in those ages as they come down you know he said when the church got to dying away in that age he said they'd be a group of people begin to call out like the children of Israel begin to call out for deliverance and God sent Moses to them well as they started crying out for deliverance God sent another message to another church age but then we come to the last one and there's not another message passed this one there's not another messenger pass this one all right it's all finished thataway God done what he said and he's waiting on you and I but why have we been now they just cut it short in the point why is it been that God has given us 50 years almost just to going to the Prophet don't you think he's been patient don't you think he's been long-suffering what do you think it demanded 20 years ago 30 years ago 40 years ago 50 years ago what if he had demanded it to come forth at that time where would you and I be some of us wouldn't even born again some of us wouldn't even born where would we be but see he's been long patient thank God thank God that he's been patient with us right because I'm sure it's been rough with him you know we talked about that morning getting believer has an angel well I've always told you when I get to her and I see him I'll have to apologize to it because I've kept him busy I don't know where you think like that or not that's the way I think I've kept him busy and I've told about the things and I had a dream one time like I don't know whether I've ever told this one to the point here forgive me for coffee but I had a dream one time and in the dream I saw this angel that was supposed to be my angel and he was talking about you know where we'd come and what would come through or what it happened and I looked at him and I said but were have you been and that's the dream that's a dream but it still and I said where have you been he said I've been with you the whole time you know that's true he had but there's a lot of times I didn't know where he was at right but maybe he was over thy rest in from all the things he'd had to put up with from the few days before that I had got into you know maybe that's the point but just forgive me having to put in a cough drop that's the old age factor and you're getting out with your soul just don't worry about it just pray for us okay but now are you with me about the thought see former and latter rain teaching rain that's what a minister does the minister gets a message from God all right and then he goes forth and speaks at sea that becomes a former Ryan now here's where the troubles are remember if you're Baptist today and preaching you're sowing a seed if you're Methodist Presbyterian Pentecostal or brand of mind okay then you're sowing a seed be careful what kind of seed we plant because it will produce alright he will come up but remember they're having a Foreman ladder run I thought I told you study brother runs message and run it in your computer form in lighter right and listen to him talking about the Baptist having a reformer rain and a lot of rain the Pentecostals and all they had a former rain and had a lot of rain alright and brother branham hotel the Pentecost we're sure you've had a lot of rain within when he got to 62 on the spoken word his original seed he knew something was coming forth that was more than what they had ever thought of so he turns to the Pentecostals in that preaching and he says you say you've had a lot of rain he said nonsense he's because you haven't had the former rain yet in other words they hadn't accepted his message up to that point and he knew that was more to come he knew he was to bring a message with that message as a former Ryan we'd have no excuse we have no excuse now when we first came when I came in the message in 66 C we could 67 right there you know we could get very few books a lot of you was there before even the books and times come along all you had was tapes and dines and and men we used to write our own concordance or some things you know and write things and and to try to keep up with them but think of it today you can't say well I don't have them books there won't be no excuse me to get to the throne and remember there are two judgments one of them's the lights are on the other ones judgment the deeds done in the body whether good or bad so we're gonna agree that one of them and we definitely don't want to be at the white throne and see but we're gonna stand at the other and give an account you say well I didn't have the Bucks brother Dale announced certain certain books on you've got the tapes you've got your computers there is no excuse you can spend hours sitting on the computer why can't you spend hours listening to the Prophet breeze okay now but listen what went wrong now the Lord is waiting on you and I to come to a place but what has went wrong all right we read it there in Jeremiah now we know that's too natural Israel you know all right that's the natural Israel that God was explaining what he was doing for them all right then he told him he said you have a horse for head and said because of that said the rain has been withholding and there has been no latter rain well alright now where are we at yes but brother Dale I don't have a horse for head I'm a born-again Christian that has nothing to do with your brain whether you're born again or not have nothing to do with your brain capacity right yeah but hi I'm born again yeah you're born to get on in your soul you're not born again in your body in your spirit and you said well I don't have no troubles you're just a big liar that's as big as I can put it I'll put it bluntly you're a liar when you say you don't have no trouble there's one thing for certain if you don't have no trouble you certainly ain't serving God yes but brother Dale I thought we wouldn't wait to go get to it this evening on a message where brother Branham was talking about it that you know the flowery bed of the east are the bad times neither one of them called you mentioned last night he was gonna do neither one of them is a sign of God's approval you know whether everything runs good or everything runs back you know you don't never thank God for bad times know many of the afflictions of the righteous which the Lord lead us out of them all how can he put it through a test and try us if he don't laugh Satan to come after Satan went after job after God had turned him loose well you know what why don't you thank God for sometimes for the troubles you're having you might find out that he's on the scene all right yeah but I thought born-again Christians did not on troubled where'd you get that idea it ain't in the Bible and it definitely ain't in the prophets message so now show me where you got that idea I'll show you in a second where you got it you got it from the old horse forehead you got it from the teaching to what was prior the denominational teaching is now all come to the Lord and you won't have no troubles all your worries is over all your financial problems is over and then your just cope I say fella you ain't serving the God I am you're a liar oh we're going to do that I wanna know I wouldn't either but we ought to you said whether your glory in the trip like no I just know it will come there's going to be troubles to a Christian cuz that's your trying time that's your trial child training cisternae I'm going home our Wednesday night and hit a deer you know what I mean we could have got him a deer hold on cheap or not car but yeah wouldn't meant to be right away we'll see you don't go well glory hallelujah no glory that you was not killed I never will forget brother Boyd's mother and they had a wreck over their bikes counties right past the schoolhouse and you drive down like that here's 441 well they just something happened to brother anyhow they just went right on across the road and that car turned over and I never will forget what she said since Jesus back in the back of that car falling around said Lord where's this thing gonna stop no it was just going everywhere well you said well you you got like you're funny about things and off well why not am I supposed to be sad but you asked me say how you doing brother Dale I'm doing wonderful you know I'm all wound up with a cold and sniffling and snorting and everything else but you know what I'm wonderful I could be laying in a nurse in a hospital or a nursing home all right kids has already said they got one picked out for him me and nany so you know I guess they're waiting on us to get old enough we might outlive them so we don't worry about that but now listen church you're getting a serious part of it comical a little bit but get you to be serious nee God is waiting on you and I and you know what he's waiting on now here's the point if you're a born-again Christian alright now remember I gave it to you Wednesday night where brother Brendan said it it's only the children of God that God deals with so thank wonderful that your name is called in heaven right no matter how bad it gets thank God praise him for everything that takes place you might find out you'll walk out of your troubles all right no but to the children of Israel they had gotten in bad shape the the background story of what we're talking about and you know they had started as you read verse one you'll find out that they started doing this they were doing bad things you know horrible things why and see God comes on the scene and evidently it must have got it may be a little dry because of the way the situation had evolved as we get on over to verse three and he says because of your horse forehead said the rains are withholding and it's been no lie to Ryan well who was the problem the children of Israel right well who's the problem today you and I good let me nail that down to what we're talking about because that's where people think well I'm a Christian I'm not supposed to have troubles they something wrong with you you need to study the message you need to see what the message has done you know and find out you ought to go ask the Lord Jesus was any troubles in his day you know you might get a good answer out of it right now to the point see what's our troubles why why is it being that we've been here all this time now may I quote the Prophet without you no he says that nothing is out of caterer he said everything is right on time do you need that quote he said nothing's out of cater there's no problems everything's right on time alright so then who's the problem me and you all right now I want you to think with me about this because we mentioned this the other day but just to get to it deuteronomy for we were bringing out the other day a little bit and they don't have this what i just wrote that scripture down you know it says that seven women would come to every man's cocktail you know they'd be more women our men in the world old rock and no said they would say let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach all right and see they wanted to have a mark of having a husband and as i tried to express that to you their point was that you know it used to be that if a girl had a baby out of wedlock who was they was pretty bad it kind ten away no more but that don't change christianity that don't change that it still goes on the side all right but you see what the point is they're saying there let us be called by thy name called we need a name so they wanted to be called Christians ever Church wants to be called Christians right let us be called by a Christian name and I told you didn't it Amaro an amazing thing you ride down the road now and you don't see a new church coming up and it'll say First Baptist Church of May's building that's what it used to be on this island right now what does it say Shiloh or spoken word Church or or any kind of a name that they don't have the name of Baptists are Methodists and things like that anymore they've got their own little names you know Oh what is it what's the one in Gainesville Jennison Franklin the free chapel the not listed as an independent or anything it's a name that name has to do with what they're thinking or doing all right do you think about that people are wanting to be called by Christian names instead of denominational names anymore that order show you that we're at the end of bringing it because and it's not going to do away with those things it's just going to change their the name that they got on the front door all right so let us be called by thy name yeah the church is saying that let us be called by this name that name to take away our reproach we want to be a member of so-and-so you've heard the old saying you've got to belong to something we'll see you don't got to belong to something you got to be born again if you're born again you don't belong to something you are part of it all right now then to come to the basis of sin that he said to them he said you've got a horse forehead now what is a horse forehead plain language for kids but they're old enough they hear it out there they know more about these words than we do right you try to protect your children from hearing bad names and think they know more bad names than you do because they're in school right they don't do no good for me you know bad night I don't like any bad night I don't even like little slang names you know people say things and they'll say a little like a dirty word we call it and they say well I I just can't help it I've been trained all my life say that you don't have to say it like I've always said you take a hammer and hit you fingernail I've seen people do that ever seen somebody get hit or do something wrong and this all these words comes out well you know what would be the best thing to do if you hit your finger now pop it in your mouth and suck on it a little bit it won't hurt it bad words all them cuss words done you any good now kids they sometimes around here this being said sometimes I don't like some of you playing sports and then you're making light of some of these kids that are smaller or doing thing didn't use that use word sometime I don't like it I don't think God likes that you said well it's just a slang word well you don't have to use slang words like I said when you hit your thumb why don't you say praise the Lord if you gotta say something you gotta say something why don't you say praise the Lord could be you could have cut two things slap off but just don't do that I'll just mention that because we you know you're out here playing and listening and kids will make a lot of other kids and say things that are slanderous about it don't say that you know yes that's not the Christian attitude you shouldn't make fun of anybody no matter what cause always remember one thing there was always my point what I look down upon you and say there's always somebody above me it's looking down on me and I don't like for it to be called or say it so don't don't don't do that okay all right now let's get into the message all right and he said you have a horse what is a horse for heat okay you say a Christian don't have a horse for everyone now well how many of you that's just like a point of illustration how many of you were born again before you come into the message and heard the truth all right now you believed in a Trinity and you taught of Trinity and you believed in all kind of eternal hell's and all kind of forms and you claim to be a Christian so your brain has nothing to do your soul in your brain is to our separate parts of you all right so your brain works through your memory reason conscious affections in time which your soul is the controlling factor from the inside all right now so a Christian can have things wrong in their brains that's my point of what saying it while ago getting you to think until truth is preached look where we are right until truth is preached look where we are we're right in the midst of all denominational systems that could be thought of I don't care how much you say you're born again because that born-again experience has nothing to do with your body in your spirit it's your soul that's born again all right so then you know could we be as I said let me be called by thy name let maybe a Christian let me be a Baptist or Methodist Presbyterian or AB randomise let me be called by that name to take away my reproach because it's a shame to not have some kind of a nametag behind you all right but what if that name has the wrong point brother Branham I'll read it to you just a minute he said there's good people in the Methodist the Baptist the Catholics they said I'm not saying they're not good people but they have the thoughts and ideas of that church system so what about us what do we have yeah but I never thought about the bride having a horse for him well what did you think did you think the day you got born again it got rid of everything now he never taught nothing like that and I ain't never heard the Prophet teach nothing like that and they ain't never heard in the Bible that talk like that the new birth is in the soul it is not in your body in your spirit it is in your soul of controlling center factor or if you want to call it spirit because there is quotations from brother Branham spirit as the entervan are so just remember the inner man of you is where the new birth takes place right see I still think wrong don't you oh no brother dude I don't never had no wrong don't you just lied so now the Bible's gets a lot right just as much as against warn us against the other we see you can't keep Satan from coming through and bringing thoughts into your mind but just remember because they come through your mind if you don't entertain that remember you ain't done nothin wrong you can't help Satan coming through and giving you wrong thoughts you can keep from entertaining the thought all right now so everybody got that clear now that we can can move on that when we get to this point in a minute in the scripture see we as Christians are not set aside from the thing brother Brown says the day you get born again he said Satan ain't ever gun he's got that's you why because he's gonna try to break you down he don't have to break down this other guy that's in the juke joints and the liquor joints and you know the they don't have to do that already got him he's after you you say you're a Christian he automatically pulls his gun puts it right into your back and start firing away at you right but just remember as I said it you said well brother Dale how can I stop these talk you can't stop thoughts coming now you don't have to thank wrong no but you can't stop thoughts from coming I had trouble with that was an early Christian in the brother moto he told me he said there's something wrong I said yeah I know it I'm trying to stop them thoughts from coming he said you can't do it he said you go crazy as about trying to do that just leave it alone he said but don't entertain it when it gets there you don't want to mean by entertainment don't mall on it you you get out talking around and I'm just playing you get out talking around sometimes you get some of the brothers and boy they're talking about their old pious life and you can look at their life and they're just they just smiling I used to do this and I used to do that and they just look like they're so thrilled well I'm ashamed of what I done I don't want to talk about what I done if you want to talk about what you done you must enjoy right trying to explain a horse for you just in a natural all right now let's get to the spiritual I mean you know to the to the part that we need to think about do you realize any denominational idea that we have contrary to the Word of God that means you've got a horse forehead are you getting it all right back to my point want to go until it's revealed well you got you know it only the reveal word can take away denominational ideas you won't get rid of them we're talking about it last night they go everywhere all that stuff goes with you you you can't get rid of those things you have to pray out to God for him to deliver you but like I said if you get happy and get tickled about what you used to do maybe you ain't got rid of things yet you might enjoyed it too much come on brother Dale's plane but it's truth all right now think about it what would be messed up in a man's forehead because your forehead is your intelligence the run said it's your conscious isn't done all right it's this plane intelligence you have a front part of your brain a back part of your brain and you really have a conscience subconscious and actually technically you do have a unconscious part of you all right because that's that's what makes everything work kind of like you're when you're asleep you're in an unconscious state and that your heart still beats everything still works you still a breathing you know all right so now remember the Bible said that they had their marks or the on their forehead right we've talked about the mark of the beast and how that we think it stamping right across your forehead 666 well they ain't gonna do that that's not what you're talking about it's when you've got in your forehead when you have the the doctrine of that church system still in your forehead you have that under inaudible brother Dale I I didn't I didn't have no doctrine when I'm back there I'm not like you I was just died well why would you die ran out somewheres else cuz you'd like to be though right so don't play with me with words see it's not that not true we come up through those systems because that's what we believe to be the truth right I can't happen if I quote they brought around them make this one said he carried a Baptist Bible and converted them to a Baptist faith what a little bit was and he was a prophet but remember a prophet don't know everything that prophet has to learn like we learn you know all right now think about it so then for us to have any idea contrary now if I don't get anything the message you get this point a horse forehead is the fact or thoughts that in your thinking abilities whatever you want to call them to make it and said brother L don't understand that it needs me okay you get that right but you just remember one thing if we're talking about the forehead it's right in here right in here is what they call the part of your intelligence of the forehead and then you get into back parts and different things but it's your intelligence that's why it's not stamped 666 on your forehead that'll never be done but it's the denominational idea of the Trinity right now am i quoting the prophet what stepped in your forehead is the understanding of the Catholic Church about the Trinity well I has that been taken away do you know that only the revealing of God's Word the truth of one God can take that away from your intelligence my mother she had it she said like that I was born the baggage I guess I'll die one well you know what I'm not against my mother I love her well you know what she probably died of Agnes I'm hoping God will give her something I'm hoping she was right but I don't know you're not talking about your mama no I'm not talking about mine I'm talking about yours now you can get more upset with me cuz it's the truth right see what's wrong with us that the word cannot be revealed to us why is it that we have trouble thinking about one God after 30 years of studying the prophets message because it hasn't been revealed it's been revealed maybe in part to take away some of the things but come on it's still right there if you don't think it's right then you go do what you you want to well you know go back to your old churches and see what your dad might do you some good some time to walk back into one of those churches and see what you got and then to realize where you've been broke from my help okay now but now listen how can God come on the scene and I'm asking a serious question think about it how can he come on the scene in a latter rain to get us ready to go out of here when we still got the old denominational ideas and doctor see that's where you you throw it right back at me I don't know how discernment I don't have to have it I just know the truth if I sitting out there I'd look back at you and I'd say it like this well we're brother Dale I'm doing the best I can what do you want me to do I want you to study God's Word I want you to study the message and listen the tapes and read the books and cuz remember only the revealed word will drive out the unbelief I don't know how no one believes you're a liar I'm sorry that's just as blunt as I can be because he were people and a human being has got unbelief he is a product of unbelief his whole makeup is unbelief you know all right now listen to the point then any idea we have what is denominationalism a blessed God I'm not a bad this you know well then talk to him just a little bit you find out that they got the same old doctor him that's why I can spot them I come up through there you know I spot a Baptist preacher in a hurry up the pulpit and him preaching away one cuz that's where I come from I know his mannerism and it's worthy you would a Pentecostal if you knew some of those times well let's see any idea that you have whatsoever I have we have any idea that is contrary to the Word of God then worse the problem act it's not in ER so we're born-again Christian it's your intelligence are you're taking abilities in science you know and see you say something about somebody and like brother Branham says only spoke originals see he said but they're good people well brother tell you you're preaching against defeating all I appreciate get something man run a worse wonderful God and the people over guard okay I'm preaching in this building I'm preaching to what's gonna listen on the tapes and whatever I'm not preaching to the that I'm preaching the poor supposed to be believers in the message trying to get us to see what it is well I don't brother Brennan was this when I look but I think maybe see you've automatically done the same thing Eve was doing in the garden when she said I think well I don't have a right thing no they plain enough no sheep have no rights am i right you need that from the Prophet well I got a rub bless car don't think what I want to that proves you're lost when you have that idea come in there be careful with those dollars be careful with it while somebody's preaching they may not have the discernment to call it out but you know God knows what you're thinking my brother now I don't know very good brother Dale let's see got it what I now quote runaround he said your thoughts are louder in heaven than your words are on earth is that's a quote we're not getting by with anything those things are gonna be answered for some work we're gonna have to give it a calendar all right now to get to the point do you understand what I'm saying about a any any thought that we have whatsoever that is contrary to the truth now brother Branham did he say it like this and see we swore by we swore that there's a Trinity and he said that Catholic doctrine of baptism father son Holy Ghost comes straight out of the pits of hell you need statements like that they certainly was not in the Word of God but you know God went to the ignorance until truth was brought amen all right he winked at it and he's still winking today that's why it's 50 years he's been blinking his eyes waiting on me and you alright but do you follow that point that anything any thoughts that we have contrary to God's Word that means that poor forehead is present when our thinking and we're just as much now listen in that thoughts and ideas we're just as much as in a Catholic churches would be would be if we went back today and sat down in one I know it I don't play around but I preached pretty hard sometimes than when I do have you sit and look at people here oh he's against everybody I ain't against nobody I'm for everybody I want to help everybody I can but truth is truth I won't tell you the truth then you can do what you want to about it okay now let's go over to where we've picked up a little bit in the message back there and let's go over to Joel don't want you to leave this is right I'll have to check I done got away from my notes anyways and I ain't worried about that part all right let's go to Joel or two I may have to find my own yeah Joel three all right now where do they have this to bring it up or not I don't know then Joel three look what it says I want to try to give them a minute to pull that up code I want them to see it so if you can brother Joe ever who's there okay you got it in Joel three okay run over to verse 12 13 yeah now I want you to think about it it says put in you put you in the sickle for the harvest is ripe come you down for the presses fool but that's overflow for their wickedness is great now but look at that next scripture that scripture has always stuck with me look what it says multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision you realize what that's saying well that's to Israel okay what is to Israel isn't it spiritual to you and I all right let's go back a few years and in time and let's think about sometimes coming down sure when we came into the message in 67 started reading a little bit 66 and picked up in 67 to walk out of the Baptist Church at that time there was a lot of doctrines begin to be started from the 67 68 69 70 s you started getting a lot of doctrines in the message that split up the message to souls to Lords borussia as we're talking about life not which is correct way to say it is Parsi uh-oh no Holy Ghost in this day like it was in the book of Acts Jesus will that that with life's wonder so let's hold that there's back in the 70s in the 70s they were bringing it out so we had ministers meetings on this they were talking about the wrong dates of brother Branham hunting out in Arizona we had ministers meetings back in the seventies on that that's not a new thing it just popped up because I've always made my emphasis the reason it did and it'll show you it goes back to that old horse forehead or idea Cosi back tire you had a lot of old people that had followed the prophets message stayed with it and believed it a lot of those doctrines were not able to make an inroad into the people right see because of the people that were old enough and it stayed with the message born-again believers that fought it out so we had ministers meetings about that because I told them then I said you don't even know what your own laws change I said I'm a deer hunter I said you know they change in states and you could have read around them here at this date and here at another date I said don't matter but I said the main thing it don't matter to me and I said because what I'm telling you on is that we if you doubt brother Branham Lester being their dates and I'll forget that but if you doubt he was there then you're doubting whether the seals were broke because out dars where he met the angels of the Lord to come back to Jefferson field to preach I said you realize that your your denying the prophets message well I meant that then I mean it obviously you had a lot of old people and they wouldn't accept that with Endicott now after about 20 years after the Prophet going you know that you started back with a lot of them doctrines under different names and ideas instead of two souls it was called chains of the soul they taught us that Jesus came physically out there in 63 and Redemption was over right that was the first doctrine that would hit me hard in this message was redemption is over well I had read enough till I said according to my Bible and my prophet Redemption was over before the world ever begun listen what are you talking about well ain't nobody to be saved after 63 I mean they literally say your kids can't even be say well what about my Luke they can't be saved cause the prophecy said if the Lord don't come my point you started doctrines trying to pull them in over the two souls the two Lords of peru's is the know Holy Ghost doctrines and all those things begin to be prevalent even in my life by time of being in the message and I believe then things was wrong I've went public from here took each doctrine of the two souls to Lords approves this son of man to all of that I took it and talked to church the truth of what I believe about it I believe every passenger order do that he ought to teach his church people what he you know what he believes about it then they can make a choice now tried to do that but it see we didn't now you've got it to word that you've got preachers in this message that's been preached in 30 years or 40 years and a lot of the preachers is the preachers that brought you into the message right lot of the preachers and puts the ones that was used to bring you into the message and where are they today more now they're not just saying this out of the other they're lambasting brother around them to every degrees all you got to do now cuz that's what makes it a shame you try to introduce somebody the message and they say who you follow so well okay I'll follow william branham turn on the computer and run in william branham and i always say this the first thing you get is gonna be wrong doctrine well boy ain't that something that you can't even click in the gods generals was the first book i got a hold up in this message was by someone else talking about no and out of god's generals that man never attacked the one women preachers whatever get the book and read it I've got it viewing it but even back being the first thing he done was attacked brother Branham and said he should have stayed with the gifts and the things they put him in there as one of God's generals but they attacked his message and thoughts and doings and they couldn't attach his life they even stated said he was a poor man and stag poor what are they doing now are you getting multitudes in the valley of decision at the time of the coming of the Lord until you don't know what to follow now you turn on somebody and you listen to them you don't know whether you don't know what they're saying place one brother dick actually brother dick hands me what that brother believe about something one time and I throw I said I don't know I said I've known the man a long time I still don't know one time he'll say I'm gonna get a new body next time he'll say it's this body retained well I don't know what he's talking about cuz he's twisting in the tongue I'm just serious there's multitudes now see they ain't like the old days or where we just had this doctor than that doctor in the fight now they've got the computers to run and do the things and look at the poor people falling you know and the lefty says well what can I do well that's true I mean it's really true what can you do especially older people that are up in their age you know and can't afford to drive 100 miles to go to a church or are not able to drive that far because of their age what are they gonna do they're under the mercies of God to the basis that that you know listening to those preachers preach Tara turn on what is it on the computer now catch the one or wasn't on it believe the stuff started out by man as believe the son believe everything brother Branham said inside that's where he started go now and do it I looked at it ain't going to I just asked other people sometimes see what his owner but now they're just multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision that's why the rain has been withholding you're in the valley of decision decisions is in your brain sure we back where we started what is your intelligence in your brain are we back to that point I brought the first about what we're thinking is a horse for head because we've got some denominational idea it's always been kind of funny to me and I'm sorry I know I'm just human but how could they convert you what are they preaching now and I ain't gonna look up to see and I don't care but what are they preaching brother Branham was wrong well who's right now you know my philosophies you can call it anything you won't true but listen to see if it's right they're claiming they've got the truth why are they saying the Prophet was wrong if they're not claiming they've got the truth well I've never hurt brother so-and-so I heard him oh yeah that's not sitting here I say something in your mind goes and you're out there somewhere in the law world and I come back and the next day I didn't hear you say that well let's get the tape put listen church do you understand what I'm saying multitude today that scripture is coming alive we look at the scriptures when the towers fall follow you know the Lord's coming when are the towers fell up you under shot down see all of those things is in the Bible a lot of literal things look around the world it's not the denomination that's giving us any trouble and I said this 50 years ago I said it'll never be the outside world come after us it'll be somebody from the inside they'll come from the inside to try to turn it down then you look at them and see what they're doing so then that scripture is right for the hour that we're living multitudes in the valley of decision what is it they can't make up their mind what's right can't make up their mind what's right well because of the way they're talked they're taught of fear you say don't know that I know they're taught of fear tactics the fear tactics has never worked with me well because I guess I've just never been afraid because I try to believe what the word says now where I'm afraid hat is afraid that we could be letting something slip by not putting it in and knowing and doing it right I'm human I'm a pastor okay a valley of decision you don't think like that look at all of these things that is went wrong I was expressing it to a brother this recently we let's see what that scripture saying about um there must be a fall in a way right the Bible speak of that that there must be a fall in a way all right can't you see that it's falling away now remember you can't fall off of a house until you get up on top of it is that plain and did the kids even get that you you don't fall off of the house standing out in the front yard you've got to get on the house so look where they've come they've got up so close until they preach this message ministers preached it for 30 40 50 years or something preach this message there must be a falling away so they had to get to the truth and now they're falling away well what about me and you Oh remember I ain't over in that church and I end up in New York night and Chicago night know if anybody's listening that's their business it's not mine but I'm just plain to tell this church what it is we could be right in the midst of that multitude in the valley of decision can't quite make up your mind make up your mind watch me and say it I just don't know whether that's true or not well come and show me I never had no problem you differ with me about some come and show me now I can put the Bible with if you like it you know if you say that I'm wrong you're duty-bound to come tell me and that's what the Prophet said you duty-bound to come and tell me where I'm wrong but like I've always said now don't come and tell me brother there I don't agree with you where am I wrong I don't know but I just don't agree with you well what do you know you know enough to leave or do something it's just excuses it's horse for head yeah well I got it right believe I don't believe show me that no Bible shows the prophets message well we got to believe what you blen out you got believe what the Prophet said now if I read what he says then I don't have no problem if you didn't read it out bring it and I'll read it you say I got a quote with you bring it cuz I'm firm I've always told you I don't care how far it looks like something's going to the left and to the right you know what I mean what brother branham sometimes he'll say something look like he'd go that away and then he'll say later and look like it goes out of way I don't care how far it gets he was the Prophet and if you'll take them things and hold on to them long enough and study them you'll see them just start coming together and then you'll find out he could say it no other way than what he said like I've always said to you here's the way I stand all right come on musician this is where I stand brother branham said you say what I say he said because I'm responsible now is that a quote he said I'm responsible so you say what I say you realize that somebody could be listening to the message saying as far as they got up was listening to statue a perfect man or a spoken word regional seeds say 62s in there you realize if they never heard any more truth they could preach that the white horse rider is the Holy Ghost and God wouldn't condemn him now come on he's got to give you something to be judged by now if you heard the truth then you're responsible but that's why the prophets he said I'm responsible say what I say and you realize now this is my way of saying it there was nobody now am I correct on this there's a prophet stand before nobody he stands before God along is that right all right see then when he brought the truth it became mandatory that you and I believe the truth now I quote what I did the other day brought around him about 1958-59 said the Baptist had just now become a denomination well my lord day was the denomination the way over a hundred years before then had the Baptist right up and everything what was he saying he's saying they turned down his message when he come and brought the message it was the condemnation not to just a Pentecostal but to ever denomination in the world because when he brought the truth they were commanded to come to the truth well maybe they didn't hear it okay Godwin sacredness but how many of them has ever turned the radio on and heard one message all the types you get what I'm talking about multitudes are in the valley of decision they don't know what to believe you ask them well I really don't know that's what gets me you know say well brother you know you leaving the church I had a couple of incidents and I said tell me where I'm off the word just show me where I'm off the word they wouldn't show me they wouldn't say a word but you know what when they left and went away now they're talking about how bad I was and where I was off well no that's not even right to be sensible as human beings if I ask you a question your answer my question brother though I don't agree with you well how come you don't worry I don't know why I don't agree with you but I just don't agree with you now that's a good answer I'd like to sell you some stock in Alcatraz if you got that worked up with a mind you said what Alcatraz don't exist no more that's what I'm saying that's how bad it looks Church I'm just trying to get you to see one time we're gonna face God forever word that has been made known to us and why has he been 50 years multitudes multitudes are in the valley of decision they had to be a falling away the people of the message had to come to the message and now they're falling away why because they got the horse 4head well I don't believe the Catholic Way well what is that like I said well ago you know I mean wouldn't it be made of something and somebody come along say brother day up run around what's wrong come on up here with us well now why are you gonna preach to me I mean you tell me brother Brown was wrong what are you gonna preach to it I'm gonna preach the truth truth of what to follow if you try to explain the Trinity to me but I didn't believe it half way back then I was probably more oneness than anything cuz I literally believed you did Jesus couldn't stop he stole and bleed that's the way I believed in one God then I found out later or to read the Bible where he got whippin City but it was alright that's why I believe it let Stan are we in the valley of decision are we in the valley of decision is our mind settled on what we believe and why we believe it what about it what we got brother because he lives because he lives cause anybody have a need and I can finish tomorrow [Music] wandering stars of avocado wondering a fish's rider that's right you keep on
