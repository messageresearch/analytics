the meeting yeah sat across to the table from me in the minister's breakfast that's the first time i ever met him and he knew my he knew my grandmother sister grace and so we had a lot to talk about and i always remember i'll never forget of all the things i remember about brother tom was when he come here and he was talking about preaching too long or preaching too short or trying to know how long a preacher should preach you know brother branham said one time that everybody was complaining about you know 20 minutes is too long he said what you need is a good four hour sermon to get you some gospel vitamins and everything and i always never forget brother tom ernest talking about that four hour sermon and so you know you mentioned that a few times from the pulpit people start getting nervous but but you know the different ones that have that have passed stone and you know there's many that are still in the battle and you know i every day i i pray there's so many that you know battling covet and and different things and sister karen pruitt passing away and you know different ones and i was thinking about this song today and it's called i've never been this homesick before

place where you know we don't be in this pest house any longer you know because it's as brotherhood said it's it's desperation time it's it's it's for the bride to get desperate so amen if y'all know the word young help me singing [Music] there's a light in the window the table spread in splendor someone's standing by the open door i can see a crystal river so i must be near forever alone i've never been this home sick before we'll see the bright light shine it's just about all time and i can see my father's standing i [Music] this world has been a wilderness and i'm ready for deliverance

want to see you high and lifted up lord we want to see you magnified and glorified in all things lord we commit all things to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen isaiah chapter 40 verse 25 i entitled this in the in the cleft of the rock and having having gotten to see a lot of mountains that i've never seen before never i'd seen the rocky mountains in pictures but i can say i've i've actually got to see them up close and there's a lot of folks here brother i'm talking about there's a lot of folks they like the beach and different things like that i can tell you i was in my element i'm a mountain person i i like the wilderness that's that's that's that's the person i am i just it's beautiful and if you've never been you ought to go but i like i told people i said well we got a glimpse of what heaven is going to be like but uh here in isaiah 40 verse 25 i want you to listen to this that's what struck me as god says to whom then will ye liken me or who shall i be equal saith the holy one a pretty powerful statement he steps out there because you know what he goes through and you start reading about isaiah and all the things that have happened in the in the in israel and all the things that they've been through and everything like that but then he comes out here and he begins to speak about this you know because they chase false gods they've chased false doctrines they fought they chased all these other things but he comes back says well which one of them is like me who can be an equal to me you you've walked in in the world of sin you've done all these things but who can be my equal he says lift up your eyes on high and behold who has created these things that bringeth out their host by number he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one faileth why says thou o jacob and speak of israel my way is hid from the lord and my judgment is passed over from my god hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increa increases strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mine up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint and we could just stop at that and almost go home but job chapter 39 verse 27 he says dot the eagle mount up at thy command and make her nest on high she dwelleth and abideth on the rock upon the crag of the rock and the strong place i want you to remember that and from hands and from fence she seeketh the prey and her eyes behold afar off her young ones also suck up blood and where the slain are there is she amen god bless you tonight you may be seated so and psalms 103 it says and if they want to bring it up they can they don't have to but it's very familiar scripture he says bless the lord on my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord on my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thy iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crown of thee with loving kindness and tender mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles the lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed so i want to speak tonight on the on the cleft of the rock and you know i was thinking about seeing all these rock structures and all these things and you know christ the scripture tells us in first corinthians that you know the rock was christ you know he said he led the children of israel through the wilderness and he said they all ate of the same spiritual meat and he said they all drank the spiritual drink he said but god was not uh pleased with them he said that rock followed them all their journey everything that they had neither was right there with them and they were and god was not well pleased because they didn't they didn't want by faith and so you know they didn't want the way god but god led them and god was trying to take them to a place and he had a place for them to be and for them to be blessed and yet they didn't walk the way he wanted them to walk what was given to him they didn't follow any of that but god continued to fall you know to lead them and that rock that was behind you know stayed right there behind them the whole time and when they became thirsty there was water that came out of the rock and everything that they had need of god was there to meet it and you know hearing the message brother man i'm speaking of israel and the church brother brahm says up on they come into the smitten rock he said notice when they come to the rock they had need now moses smote the rock with the rod that's where he we left last night smote the rock with the rod and the rod wasn't god's judgment and god the rod was god's judgment rod and he smoked the rock and there was a cleft in the left side of the rock where the children of israel got hungry there went they went there and a beehive a bee got in there and made a hive and they got honey out of the rock everything they had need of was in the rock the rock followed the church and the rock was christ jesus when they were thirsty they drank from the rock when they were hungry they ate from the rock wherever they went the rock followed them and the rocks still following the church christ is the rock that was in the wilderness notice now there's the same rock so the same rock is still here today so when they walked and they had a need there was a rock for them to go to now when we go back and look and he begins to speak of the eagle brother i'm talking about the eagle being in the rock and having and you know he said they came from the storm and they hid from the storm there was a place for them to go to and that's what i i liked about what job had to say because here's job talking about you know who allowed he said does the eagle mount up at thy command you know it wasn't it was job didn't have the power to control any of that but see god set all that in motion that was all that god had done he said she dwells she dwelleth and abideth on the rock and that rock was christ and brothers and sisters we're eagles god tightens us as eagles we're god's heritage so there was a rock that was given for you and i to stand on and he said for us to come to that rock to stand on so when he met their needs in the old testament and that rock was behind them and everything that they had need of they came to the rock then the thing he said that same rock follows us today so brother sisters we have a rock to come to a sure foundation and everything that we have need of is in that rock we have a rock to stand on and he has placed that rock before us and he said everywhere they had to go it was right there and everything that we have need has been has been given to us in this day well because we live in it we live in a world that is nothing but shifting sand there is no sure foundation but brothers and sisters we have a sure foundation we have a sure word of prophecy that when everything else is falling apart we have a place to stand why because we have we live in an hour where everybody has turned against this message they've turned against the word and they live lean to their own understanding but the thing is is everything that everybody has linked to has failed everything else is collapsed you know one of the things that i was thinking about was you know brother branham talks about these these stories and and people that well they're just they're just stories but there's real biblical truth in what he had to say and number two i don't care if anybody i'm just going to go ahead and say this i don't care if anybody says well science says it can't happen well if brother branham said it i'm going to take what brother branham said over what science ever says amen because they were saying they said all these stories about brother i'm talking about the and it's not that they were talking about brother branham specifically specifically but it was about the stories and how you know the eagle carries the young and all these different things and they were saying well this this can't happen said said the young eagles by the time they get out of the nest they're too heavy for the mother to carry and then they come up with these different different reasons about different things and so like i was like well listen brother branham said he was sitting in a on a horse in a saddle with binoculars and he was watching that mother eagle take them baby eagles back up in the mountain that's exactly it's good enough for me but you know it's just like everything else people have taken everything that brother branham had to say everything about the word and they have said it to the side and they they spent all their time well did this really happen did that really happen is it is this true is that that's right true the problem is is people have not come to a sure foundation why because if you lean to your own understanding if that's all you have is is your finite mind then you have no place to stand you're not ever going to reach anything because there's no foundation in in a human in a human body and our human element our human mind we're not ever going to make it but we know that in the last days that one thing would take place that everything that could be shaken would be shaken because anything because everything that can be shaken will be shaken because you're going to find out that nothing else is going to stand because that which is sure and that is that is true is the only thing that's going to stand and because you know we live in a we live in an hour in a day that we see that because god has called a bride and the bride has been called to the place that god has called her to and it's to be the fulfillment of the word and every age god called a bride to be the fulfillment of the word for that day and he has called a bride in our day to fulfill the word and we are to be the word made flesh in our day and we're to be the manifestation of what god has wanted in this hour what the word it says what we should be but we can stand there and we can worry and and and get all frustrated about things but you know what god has called us to a place god has a place for us and that is in the cleft of the rock god has called us to a place why because he wants us to be like jesus you know here's here in the in the message show us the father 1950 brother brown says he was a god-man i believe he was the infinite son of god born of the virgin mary that's right everything the bible said he was i believe he was when he was on earth he looked like god he talked like god he preached like god he rose like god he ascended like god amen he god was in him god manifested here in a body of flesh on the earth in a form his son christ jesus notice god was in his son he was always god deals back there in the beginning when he was with the israelites coming through the wilderness there was there was a rock going along there following them a spiritual rock god told moses smite the rock it'll bring forth water what was it he smoked with the rock that was in his hand the rod wasn't wasn't moses rod that was god's rod the judgment and he smoked the rock and the rock brought forth water he said when one time they wanted a drink they went to the rock when they wanted something to eat they went down there and a bunch of bees had a hive in there in the rock there was a cleft god stood in that cliff the bees had their nest in the cliff everything they had in need of they went to the rock the bible clearly teaches us teaches that christ was the rock was that rock that was in the wilderness he said if you're thirsty not go to the rock if you want honey sweetness go to the rock if you want life go to the rock if you want to believe god was in his son go to the rock he was in the rock speak to the rock and it'll bring forth waters there you are god in his son that's right so when jesus came he said he said i am my father or one and he was the manifestation of that he said everything that my father shows me that's what i do he said i do not the son does nothing of himself except that what the father shows him he said he said i walk here he said because i'm here to please the father he said i'm here to do the will of god and he said he walked like god he talked like god everything was god why because that's who he was and brothers and sisters that's who you and i are as the children of god is the offspring of god is to manifest god in this hour and see it is such a blessing to know who we are and to know what we have but as brother branham said we live so far below our means amen we don't claim what's ours amen because you know god has poured out all things to us and you know you you think of what what he done in his in his life when he came forth all the things that he gave up when he when he left the splendor of heaven and when he when he came and he became to be born of a virgin and he came to to into into this world and he was in a manger over a manure pile here here he was and he came and you know he came to suffer the same things that you and i suffer and he comes to see go through all the same struggles that you and i come through and you know he is our high priest because he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and of all the things that he came to do and he came to to close that gasoline to bridge the gas the chasm that was between man and god and he came to do that and bring us back into fellowship with him and to give us all things well the scripture tells us he said we are heirs of god and joint heirs with christ so all the things that he had he said all that god was he poured into christ and then he said all that christ was he poured into the believers so all things have been poured had been given to you and i have been poured into you and i why because we we are just what he is and yet we find people that that don't really they get so so tied up in in the world and you know and the day-to-day life and and we get so bound and we we get so won because all we see is what we see in our in our in our view of these things of these walls and and you know just this three elements that we're you know these three um what's the word brother dimension thank you i knew somebody would know but i mean you know this all we lit we live in these three dimensions and that's all we see we just live in this in this flesh and it's always see and you know we still we still live under this this uh veil we said we you know we live under this thing and you know that's that's the devil's job is to walk around and you know he's he's here to blind you we get so blinded to the things of the world you know you know we're we're spiritual beings but we've we've come to have you know to have a natural as brother ernie always said you know we're we're not natural beings having a spiritual uh experience he said where spiritual beings have unnatural experience but you know how we've come and but you know that's his desire is you know to walk around and you know he just wants us to have blinders on and you know we just walk around with her with our eyes blinded and we can't see but god's trying to the whole time he's trying to remove the veil and you know as as the scripture tells us in revelation you know he said he said buy of me i sav that you can see he said you know there was i salve of the word that he wanted to bring to the people to clear their vision because they couldn't see why because it was so clouded and so many times we allow the devil to come back and cloud our vision of who we are and so many times we see what brother what the prophet told us what brother branham said and what the scripture tells us and then we see these things and we wonder why we don't why we don't advance why because nobody steps out you know and i i i'm preaching on myself i'm the world's worst but when god has called us to a place he's called us to a higher place he's called us to a greater revelation he's called us to a greater thing and then you know what you know what and then we stay in the same place that we've always been we always stay here and god calls us up higher and yet we don't go but brother branham was speaking of an eagle coming in and being born in that rock and brothers and sisters that's you and i we have been born in the rock we've been born of christ jesus we've been born of the word and so we have been born on a sure foundation we have been built on on the foundation of the word of the apostles and the prophets so we have a sure foundation that you have been given to that he has called us to this place it wasn't what you've done it's what he done he's the one that's done it he's the one that's brought you to this place he's picked you here and he wants you to walk in the liberty of it this is from the message the eagle stirring her nest brother ram says he says yet an eagle all he hears how much different he is from the chicken but they're they're both birds what is the chicken the chicken is a denominational brother but he's a chicken how much different is from chicken but the eagle goes just as high as he can and builds his nest in the cleft of the rock and he goes up there so no predator can get to him he said that's the way a real preacher builds his church as an eagle of god he places it on the word and the spirit of god he says you know all these old gappers and different things none of this can affect you he said because he could send eagles so high born in the kingdom of god you talk about these you know elvis presley and all author godfrey the bunch of stuff just turn away for it because you are eagles in the hour in the hour of god is as the spirit of the living god he said they're high ambitions so you know the eagle goes to the the highest place the highest place that he can reach well because that's what god has called us to to a higher place to the highest place that we can reach why because it's always a stepping stone why because you know you you come from from your old life and there's there's a step of justification which is a little higher in god and then their sanctification is a little higher in god and the new birth is you know the baptism of the holy ghost is a little bit higher in god but then there's more steps above of that to keep on climbing in in god amen and the message and hearing the message the eagle in in her nest brother bran was speaking he says and as the church was born in the cleft of the rock he said we cannot be satisfied there god stirs up the nest sometimes comes in with a mighty rushing wind like he did on the day of pentecost and all the old worldly loose feathers fly out he sends a pentecostal revival and shakes up the nest then he gives a certain scream and all the little eaglets know something's fixing to happen they're eagles that's the reason when you see a shaking time come eagles are ready for a blessing the church is ready for something the true church of god when they see a shaking time coming amen and brothers and sisters we are living in a shaking time but god has called you to a place so whatever place god has called you to you know there's a higher place to come to and he says a real true eagle is not going to be satisfied where she's at so there's a higher place to come to so there's a because he said he said when when it's time to move and sometimes we get stuck in a place where we don't move he said then the winds of revival start blowing the holy ghost starts moving for us to move on so it's time and many times we we fail to move when the holy ghost moves many times many times we've had times in our lives where things have come and the lord's tried to speak to us to move on and we fail to move on why because we're so afraid to step out in faith to move with god why because we but see if we fail to realize who we are and what god has called us to and who we are if we know who we are anyway i mean it's it's so because you know it's just like a child you know i i talk about my my boys you know my little levi wherever he's at he just turned 16. little he is like my dad always said he's in the back like my dad always said i never was little so i used to tell everybody when i was little my dad said you never was little so i'd always tell everybody when i was young he couldn't he couldn't argue with that but you know when when children you know they put their full trust in you you know it's like it's like you know you you walk up to when they're little and you get your nose and you and they're like oh yeah no i still got it but you know they have trust and what is it i mean you'll stand there and they'll jump off of something and they believe you'll catch them you get a few more years like you know what i don't i wouldn't jump off this right here too much you know you know going to hold on to something and then everybody's like well you know we got to start looking to see what what could happen well they don't do that why they they have trust and if we had faith you know because you know i can fail you can fail know that everybody but you know what there's one thing that god cannot do he cannot fail god cannot fail and so when god says listen i have something for you so if he has something for us then you know what it's not it's he's not an indian giver so if he's called us to this place that we can get into to be on this rock right to have a sure foundation that you know we don't have to worry about what's coming do we need to just put our full trust in him and believe have confidence in what god says and we can just walk with god and not have to worry about everything but we allow when the winds blow and things happen and then we start to worry what's going to happen well you know what it's not that i put my trust in a man i don't have i don't have trust in a man amen but i do have trust in the and the god of that man i don't have trust i don't you know because i don't put brother branham up on a pedestal we honor and reverence the man for the god-given gift in his life and the call that he was given in the office that he had but that didn't change who he was he was still a man and he still had to pass away but you know what that didn't change the god that was in that man we don't we we don't worship a pastor but we honor and reverence a pastor because he's a god-given man and he's been given a call and he's been given an office to do a job for us he is a servant to us and so he said brother branham said that he was ordained of god to lead you through but you know what a a pastor is not somebody to be your babysitter he's not somebody to push you along but he's supposed to guide you along and you know it's not his job to answer every little single question why because there's a time that he can guide you but he's guiding you to christ and it's between you and god not not not to have somebody to you know do i have to ask him every single question no we've got to grow up and realize that he can see that god is being manifested in you that's right so then then brother he doesn't he doesn't have to you know worry and and all these things you know and worry about what's going to take place and all the stress that comes with it one because if you and i stand on our own two feet then you know what then he can see that we are following the word that has been preached as he stood up here the other other sunday and said you know he said we can say that the word has been preached in this church we've had the word in our day the word has come through from this pulpit then you and i we can stand and walk on that but it's not but it's not been a man it's been gone all the way and so then you know then god wants us to continue in that so when things happen when things come our way it's not a man that we're looking at it's god well because the one thing that hasn't changed even though you know brother dale maybe not be preaching at this time but there's one thing that we're not looking at we're not looking at a man we're looking at god god is not changed you nothing has changed god's still the same so then i have i have total confidence in and whatever's going to take place why because god has it in control i don't have any control i don't have to worry about it and many times people will almost get to the point where they start to get white-knuckled about things i don't have to god wants you to know that there's no need to be like that because if you're in the in the cleft of the rock that was that was christ if you're in that cleft then you don't have to worry about the storms you don't have to worry about the heartaches and the pressures why because as brother branham said he said when that eagle went into that cleft of the rock and stayed there he said then he could let off the pressure so we have a place that we can go to god wants us to be firm at our foundation to be where god wants us to be so we don't have to worry about what takes place god has it under control but you know you and i are the ones that we have a responsibility we're the ones that brother brown said we're supposed to be praying for our pastor then you know we have we have that responsibility to do that amen why because he has stood he has stood for us so many times and now it's our time to stand for him but uh you know and if i can say anything tonight you know i i just i just won't i just want your faith to be built i want you i want your faith to rise up i want your hearts to be comforted i want i want you to walk out of here tonight knowing that god is in control whatever you've heard today and we we get so wrapped up on things that happen in the world and the things that we hear and what the devil sits on our shoulder and tells us what the doctor has told us all these different things that have talked to us but let me tell you what jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever what he said in the past is still the truth today and it didn't change that's right why because the one that came the one that one that set all the stars into heaven in orbit and he spoke all things into existence came in human flesh and came and became became your redeemer and became your father and became your god and he became your advocate and he's the same one today that he's your healer and of all these things that he's done he's come and now he's going to tell you no fear let your hearts be comforted so if you begin to say all these things the brothers and sisters let me tell you that's what god wants you to have whatever you have need of all you've got to do is reach out and get it one because he said because he said that rock followed them and he said it's the same rockets following the church today and if it's the same rock that's following you and i today it's right there for us but many times we fail to realize that's that that the cleft of the rock that smitten rock was right there when all the storms and all the things happen we don't have to worry amen there's a cleft in the rock you know the the cleft was when moses struck the rock and it created that cleft in the rock brother brown said that was the spear mark in the side of jesus amen that's right he said it opened up it created the access so when the bride came out from him but he said that's where the bride came back to right in the heart of god amen see many times we fail to realize what god thinks of us what god sees of us he said he said when you get to this place he said it's not a place to weary he said he said we get so worried about things and we get so wrapped up in things but he said he said this is not a place to be worried he said this is a satisfying place he said this is a place to be satisfied so that because when it was as in psalms that we're reading in psalms 103 he said he said he fills my mouth with good things so that my youth are renewed like the eagles why because when that eagle went back into that cleft of the rock then he had a place that he could let off the pressure brother brown said when he went into that place and he and he was there then that he could scream out that he was that he was relieved of those pressures so we have a satisfying place god wants us to realize who we are and what god thinks of us see many many times many times we get so we get so mindful of the things of the world that we don't realize what god thinks of us and we don't we don't think of what god thinks of us then we don't realize what god wants us what has in store for us what the good that he has for us you know and it's and it's so good because even even when we do wrong yet as the scriptures as we were reading there when we took the communion there you know then we are chastened to the lord well because that's god's love to us that he would chasten us he said that we will not be condemned with the world well because there's a separating where we're separated from the world we're not like the world there is a blessing a covenant that we have that the world doesn't know anything about they don't have what we have but you know there's a place that we can come to that we can do we show the world what god who god is and what god is what the love of god is the world is looking to see what these things are when it's you and i but you know so many times we we just we just let ourselves get wrapped up and we're just we're just you know uh living the normal life just we're just an employee somewhere we're just a college student we're just a high school student we're just a kid we're just you know just going through the norm we're just going through the normal way of life the normal routes and everything and not realizing you know god you can be god to people god wants to show the world jesus christ the love of god well who is he going to show that to through so god has called us to this place that we can we can be what god has us to be to come into that cleft of the rock that christ was smitten and it opened up he opened up access for you and i to come to come back he wanted us to come back to so many times you know we we get into in our lives and we're so we're so bound down by things and we don't realize who we are what god has done what the blessings god has given us and he's called us to these things that we need to step forward and and walk in the liberty that he has given us to understand that we are in this cleft of the rock and if we're standing in this cliff then then we have we have to the pressure to let off you know brother bran was speaking of of that of the eagle and one time he was talking about you know he tells the story about that old eagle and he said you know they're in a and that old eagle you know he gets he gets all bound down with all these bad uh growth and and different things and he just gets so hardened and he gets so bound down with things of the of the world the cares of life and he said he said he gets all over his beak and he gets all over his head and he said when he gets so bound that you know he can't he can't live in that situation he said he's got to go to the rock and he said he said when he goes to the rock he said there's a place for that eagle to go to and he said he said you know when he he's you know he's down there and where he's born he's on that one rock but there's a higher rock to go to and he keeps climbing and he goes to the highest one that he can get to and he's in there and he finds a place and then and job it talks about he said he said he said he goes to the crag of the rock he said you know he's on the solid rock he said then the cry the crag of the rock and he said a strong place and he said he said that eagle goes into that place and he said he'll stand there and realizing that if something doesn't take place he's going to die he gets to a place of desperation and when he's in there he walks up to that rock and he said he begins to beat his head on that rock why because through that rock is the is the way that he is comes back to life and he stands there and he begins to beat and he says oh he said he goes through all kinds of torture going through that that beating that he has to go through all that stress and the trauma that he's going through to have that stuff removed from his head and he said he begins to beat on that thing and he said you know then it just rattles his brain but he goes up there and he keeps doing that and he keeps beating on that and he said that's the way you and i are we have a place to go to that we can have all that stuff removed but you know what you've been called to that you've been called to that place to do that there's a place you know because you know you have to desire to have that stuff removed he said he said you know as long as that eagle is there he said as long as he can feel a little bit of that stuff hanging on he'll stay right there and beat his head until he gets all that stuff beat off of him and so he said there's a place that you come to why because it begins to move all of the things of the world and all the things that that has that has been in the past that's held him down that has that has uh limited him in all these areas but he realizes he said it becomes a he sees the blood as it begins to flow and all these things as it goes through but he said he realizes there's a place for him to be and he begins to beat and he begins to beat and he said you know there's a rock there that has there's a special rock that's there that he has to beat his head on to break all that stuff loose and there's a destinated place for him to come to for him to beat all that stuff loose and he knows what he has to do and brothers and sisters there's a rock that you and i have come to and then and that special rock has been called to you know we can stand on a sure foundation but you know there's things in our lives we still got to get rid of there's things that still hold us back that we've held on for too long that bind us that hinder us and there's a way to get rid of it and brothers and sisters we have been stood before a rock a rock there has been a rock one because there's a way to get rid of of the things of the world the things that hold you back why because you can be a son of god or whatever but there's still things that god wants to wants to get out of our lives and we have to be molded into the image of christ and there's a place that we can go to that special rock that's honed a certain way i was reading i was reading an article this man was speaking of of the rock formations and and you know he was talking about a craig and most of the time we think of a crag just being a extension out of a rock that comes out to a certain point and you know sometimes they have points and different things but the one i was reading this article and the man was talking about a crag of a rock and how it comes up out of the mountain and he said the one thing that he mentioned that struck my attention was he was talking about how this thing is honed this rock is home to a certain point and so when this rock is home why because there's a honing that has to be done there's a special rock that we come to one that's home to the to this word that has come to the day that we live in that is to own us to that so you know it's no longer i it's not me but to cut away all of the worldly all of the old man all the other things that we can be just jesus christ that we molded him the image of jesus christ and there's a rock that can come in and just cut all that away and we have been given that in our day that we can you know that we have to come to this foundation but there's a rock that's here to cut all these other things away from us amen and we can be cut and we can we can be free from all these things and he said as long as he begins to feel just a little bit of that old junk that he's held on that has bound him he said he's going to stay right there and he's not going to leave and he said he's going to stay right there and he's going to get all that stuff loose and he said until he breaks all that stuff loose and when he gets off of his head and off his beak and everything when he gets free he said then he begins to scream he begins to scream that he's free that he is that he's been freed from these things and brothers and sisters when you receive the word in our day when you've received the word of freedom and liberty and he has set you free then you can see and stand up and proclaim your liberty and freedom and say who you are god has called us to these things that you can that we can stand up and proclaim what god has done in our day not to be bound by the things of the world but god has called us to this place god has called us to the place that we can be free from these things and i'm so thankful that we have a word that has been given in our day as he said add to your faith so your faith is where that foundation is where you're on that rock but he said he said that eagle gets to a place where they start wanting to find a higher place he said they can't be satisfied where they are what is that he said add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge in that honing rock that stone as you're going up there's a honing that's taking place why because as because when god starts to speak to you you still feel the things of the world but you know that's what he's doing he's calling you to realize hey i still got things i got to get rid of but he's called you to stand in the cleft of the rock that you can be free from these things and so we stand in the cleft of the rock and we see these things and god wants us to be free of these things many times the word is bred has been brought forth why because it shows us what needs to be taken place lord let us be free from these things lord help us get rid of these things what is it that needs to what we need to do lord help us that we can step forth and we can cut all these things of the world loose from us lord we don't we don't want to be bound by the things of the world while we still we still fight a carnal mind this body is still under under the curse of death but what there's a word that's been given that we can cut away all these things that we can be free to walk in the liberty of the word the word has called us to a body change well if he's called us to a body change then what is the body then the word has called us to cut away all these things well death is still holding on but you know what he will not hold us why because the word has been given to us to cut all that away when the when death when death starts up your sleeve when the death angel comes or whatever you know what he'll have to pass you by why because he don't have a hold on there's a place that we can come to there's a body change that's been called to us a group of people and we've been called to that place and i want you know realizing that how fortified you are when all the storms that rage and all the things that take place you're on a sure foundation just as just as moses there you know god's speaking to moses and you know he began to speak to him he said lord i want to see you lord i want to see who you are and in that time god told moses he said i have a special place for you he said i want you to come stand in this rock in this cleft of the rock braham was speaking he said that moses smote the rock and it created the cleft it brought forth the water but then moses went back in that cleft to see god and god has a place for you you want to see more of god there's a place to be standing right that you can see more of god god has a place for you amen and so that cleft is for everybody there's a higher place to come to that we can come to that we can see god brother brown says this is from letting off the pressure brother brahm says he said i know a rock the man can come to and he said and can beat and be beat until all the doubt is gone all the worry and cares of the world is gone when he's beat the crust of sin from around him until the blood has sanctified his soul then eternal life is sure to come he can just sit back and let off the pressure because he eternal life is sure oh eagles today that's why you're here your eaglets but if the crust has begun to blind your eyes the cares of the world or you just can't swallow all the food of god let's come to that rock in a weary land that's come let's come there and beat upon the altar until the crust is broke and our eyes can see clearly jesus again and the cares of this world has passed away then the pressure will let off he's a rock in a weary land a shelter in this time in a time of storm a refuge a haven of rest for the weary he said let's come to that place amen god bless you tonight you can stand how the musicians come i want to sing that song brother brother boyd uh he hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock that shadow's a dry thirsty land amen you know you can be in a weary place you can be in a dry place but you know what god's there and if that rock is there behind you he's oh look how dry it is and they were like just like the children of israel they were so afraid that they were going to be they're going to dry they're going we're going to die right here and not realizing the rock is right there everything that they had needed was right there and many times we get wrapped up well what's going to happen next what's going to happen next well you know what god has every footstep the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord so whatever happens you know what god has his hand in it amen so if if you know if sickness comes my way then you know what it doesn't change the fact that he's still the healer and if and if you have any kind of problem in your life if it's financial then you know what he still knows how to make a way well because the scripture tells us that peter was there with jesus and they had to pay their taxes well you know what they went fishing when the woman had had to pay your bill and the prophet come to her and told her so we'll gather up all the vessels well then you know what they started he said and then when when it became a famine and and i i love i love i love that story elijah you know he's sitting he's sitting down there by the uh the uh brook cherith he's sitting there and the ravens are feeding him you know he's getting spiritual sandwiches [Music] he's getting fed meat and bread and he's sitting there beside the brook and he's and he's drinking and he's just enjoying himself in the presence of the lord and god tells him said listen i've prepared a widow woman to sustain you i'm doing pretty good right here beside this brook but there's this woman over there with her and her son and she's starving to death and she's milling measuring out the meal and wondering how long her meal is going to last and she's sitting there scraping in the barrel trying to figure out where she was what's going to take place but you know what she did not realize she did not look in that other realm because there was a way that was already made for her but she didn't see it she didn't see what god had prepared for her but she was sitting just scraping by on that little meal but when when elijah came out of the out of the wilderness and he came to her and he spoke to her then you know what she done she went along with what he said he said can you give me can you give me a drink of water and you know what didn't hinder her [Music] and he said oh can you make me a little cake you know that called her attention but you know what she stood there and said i'm you know i'm the prophet of god and i have brought you a word that's right amen and i want to tell you something sister he said if you make me a little cake first he said you'll never go hungry all through this famine he said everybody around you is going to be starving to death and you're going to see death and destruction and all these things but it won't touch you [Music] why because god had made provision for her and she went out there and made it and didn't matter how little that cake was she followed the word that the prophet had given her and she made that cake and he took that cake and because she honored his word and she followed what he had to say that she was blessed and brothers and sisters we've been given a word in our day and we take this word and we believe it and if we pray for for somebody and they don't get healed well then they should send us into desperation but you know what i'm not going to give up i'm going to continue to pray till they get healed whatever you have need of then you know what we can stand here and claim it we don't have to lay hands on you you believe it you stand up and proclaim it you say what god said he's the high priest of your confession that what is your confession tonight because if you're standing in that cleft that he has opened the word to you and you're fortified behind the word then you can say he said he said you say to this mountain and don't doubt in your heart brothers and sisters we should get rid of because god's made a way for us to get rid of the doubt that we can stand behind the word and we can proclaim what god has said why because we can claim our families and not have to worry when do things go up and down and all things go sideways we don't have to worry when you when you go to the doctor and he gives you a bad report then you know what we go to the great physician and i tell you it's always a good report what if you if you have a need and financial or whatever spiritual whatever it is if you're praying about something you say well lord i just don't see these things in the scripture just right i don't understand how these things put together and i've heard brother wade preaching i've heard brother dale preaching the brothers they preached these things and i've read what you what you said i just don't see it to come together it just it's cloudy and it's a little i don't understand these things speaking of what he said he said a real true eagle will understand well then you know what i can just put my faith in i put my confidence in that well i don't know when it's going to come it may not you know brother dale can tell you all those years that he said reading written seven eight books seven five books whatever listen to two tapes all the things you know he didn't it just didn't come overnight just fall in his lap well because it came gradually it came bit by bit little little by little he said you know hear there a little bit [Music] word upon word line upon line precept upon precept so he began to add upon those things well brothers and sisters don't fail to hold on don't fail to hold on to what god whatever you claim that hold on to it don't back up don't worry about the winds that blow you're in the cleft of the rock when the storms are raging stand by me that's where he's at right there in the cleft of the rock with you he is the cleft of the rock praise the lord brother sink oh wonderful savior is jesus my lord savior to me he hideth [Music] of pleasure i sleep [Music] he hides my life in the depths of his love and he covers me there with his hands [Music] oh wonderful is jesus my lord [Music] me [Music] that shadows first [Music] in the depths of his love and he covers me there with his hand and he covers me there with his hand [Music] is i sing in my rapture [Music] that shadows [Music] watch [Music] in the name [Music] his
