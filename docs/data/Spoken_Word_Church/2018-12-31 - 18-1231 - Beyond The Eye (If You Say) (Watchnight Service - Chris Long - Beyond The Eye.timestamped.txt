[31:50] hey man isaiah 55:8 9 for my thoughts
[31:55] are not your thoughts neither are your
[32:00] ways my ways saith the lord for as the
[32:06] heavens are higher than the earth so are
[32:09] my ways higher than your ways and this
[32:14] is the key to me tonight my thoughts he
[32:16] says than your thoughts his thoughts are
[32:20] higher than ours let's see if we can
[32:23] climb Jacob's Ladder tonight and get
[32:26] into the mind of God shall we let's pray
[32:29] Heavenly Father were just thankful Lord
[32:31] where we're standing here father because
[32:34] we love you and we love your children
[32:36] Lord and we want to do anything we can
[32:38] to further ourselves Lord into the
[32:41] kingdom father we realize that it's a
[32:44] trying time Lord that the devil is as a
[32:48] roaring lion but he is not the Lion of
[32:51] the tribe of Judah as he would try to
[32:53] portray himself as Lord he is not the
[32:56] Word of God his ways are not your ways
[32:59] his thoughts are not your thoughts so
[33:02] father were asking father that you'd
[33:04] forgive us first of all of our sins in
[33:07] our trespasses Lord that the precious
[33:09] blood of Jesus Christ could be applied
[33:12] and father that you'd let the mind of
[33:15] our hearts be open to attain that higher
[33:20] ground bless your children for their
[33:23] efforts bless all those Lord that are
[33:25] out there at the end of the broadcast
[33:28] Lord we'll be sure to always give you
[33:33] the honor and the glory and the praise
[33:35] in the lovely name of Jesus Christ we
[33:38] ask it amen
[33:40] god bless you you may be seated
[33:44] sure-sure I may need it now this is just
[33:49] my second time doing this and and of
[33:52] course they asked me last year could you
[33:53] go for hours I said I don't think so
[33:56] so today so they add they said could you
[34:00] go an hour and a half I said I could do
[34:01] that
[34:02] yeah hopefully I won't go for hours
[34:05] brother Samuel but it'll be up to the
[34:09] Lord I know I need to relax so that the
[34:13] Lord can just take me and use me you
[34:16] need to relax now III do I have no
[34:20] problem with you putting on your
[34:22] spiritual thinking cap and your and your
[34:25] spiritual seatbelt and and and your
[34:28] antennas up and but what's most
[34:30] important is that you have a thinking
[34:33] man's filter nothing more important that
[34:37] in the day and age we live in and the
[34:39] thinking man's filter is the Holy Ghost
[34:42] now there can be that can become a
[34:45] controversial subject you know you can
[34:48] be baptized with the Holy Ghost every
[34:50] day of your life and be lost and go to
[34:52] hell did you know that now that kind of
[34:56] grotton's on people you know because
[34:59] then then when you make that statement a
[35:01] sense of why I got the Holy Ghost and
[35:03] then you can have it every day of your
[35:05] life and be lost and go to hell
[35:07] what gives let me tell you folks
[35:11] something if you get the person of the
[35:16] Holy Ghost which is Jesus Christ a lot
[35:21] of people don't know who Jesus Christ
[35:23] another way all they see him as as a
[35:27] benevolent man somewhere thank you
[35:30] brother
[35:31] somewhere in years was double portion I
[35:35] like it somewhere in his early 30s to
[35:39] mid 50s that's the way they see him you
[35:45] know breaking the bread and handing out
[35:47] the fish and healing the sick and and
[35:49] saying really good kind words that have
[35:53] life in them but I'm finding out even in
[35:57] the ranks of the believers today that
[36:00] you and I are acquainted with they're
[36:03] losing sight of the fact that he was the
[36:05] word
[36:07] made flesh that's why the prophet of God
[36:14] constantly reminded us to stay with the
[36:18] word because they realized the
[36:21] importance of the word because without
[36:23] all the word you can't have all the word
[36:27] made flesh now a lot of people have part
[36:31] of the word and they become part of the
[36:34] word made flesh the problem with that is
[36:37] there's still a portion of themselves in
[36:41] there and they're going to try to take
[36:43] the part of the word that they have and
[36:46] they're using to be made flesh hybrid
[36:51] with what they think we have to lose our
[36:56] minds as I was telling brother Wade
[37:01] today I've got to lose the last two
[37:03] marbles I got because it's the mind of
[37:09] Christ that's going to make the
[37:11] difference now we all are out here in
[37:16] the congregation I'm up here and behind
[37:19] the pulpit and we're all thinking I hope
[37:22] now some of you may fall asleep I know
[37:26] you're I might call your name this is a
[37:35] test now it's only a test okay so I
[37:42] didn't get up here to bore you but I
[37:45] want you to relax and I'm not going to
[37:48] preach anything to you that that that's
[37:52] new I couldn't the Bible says there's
[37:58] nothing new Under the Sun
[38:01] so no matter how mixed our convoluted or
[38:05] how straight or how level or how there's
[38:08] nothing now it may be new to you but
[38:12] there's nothing new so before I get
[38:15] started I want to lay something out to
[38:18] you because I've got a little bit of
[38:20] time I'm usually in a hurry brother
[38:23] Samuel because I'm conscious of the
[38:26] clock and and the Spirit is willing but
[38:31] the flesh is oh so weak I understand
[38:37] that now listen if if you start to get
[38:39] tired because the heats coming through
[38:41] the building and the hour grows late
[38:43] stand up listen there's nothing wrong
[38:46] with stretching your legs and while
[38:48] you're stretching them give a little how
[38:50] do you yeah was brother brother Wade was
[38:55] introducing me to his sister that likes
[38:57] to shuffle na sis there ain't nothing
[39:00] wrong with a little shuffle now but
[39:03] listen brothers and sisters you know you
[39:05] see that they we live in and and people
[39:08] have become cold you know dormant who
[39:13] I'm gonna preach on that here in a
[39:14] minute and they become you know kind of
[39:17] laid-back and really the biggest problem
[39:21] we've got is we're know-it-alls now I
[39:26] don't know it all
[39:28] I find out the more that I search into
[39:31] the depths of God word Wow the more that
[39:34] I hear the ministry that God hath placed
[39:37] Wow there's all kinds of things that I
[39:41] don't know but I know the God who knows
[39:46] them
[39:47] that's the key we need that God living
[39:51] in us so that our ways are not our ways
[39:57] his ways need to be our ways his
[40:01] thoughts need to be our thoughts we need
[40:04] to get rid of our own selfish selfie
[40:10] I know y'all take selfies I don't like
[40:15] them I don't like them because first of
[40:18] all I'm not very photogenic
[40:20] no matter what camera or phone you're
[40:23] using with the 7 lenses and the and the
[40:26] 20,000 pixels it doesn't make a lick a
[40:28] difference but it's just a sign of the
[40:33] times you know don't don't feel bad if
[40:36] you take selfies that's not what I'm
[40:38] getting out I'm getting out look at the
[40:39] age we live in
[40:40] it's a selfish self-centered me me me me
[40:46] me well let me tell you folks something
[40:49] the reason how we can tell that you have
[40:52] eternal life oh there's a formula
[40:56] there's a chemistry are you living for
[40:59] others Oh
[41:03] most folks want to go home now yeah I am
[41:08] not living for anybody else but myself
[41:12] well you're gonna have a problem now
[41:16] brothers and sisters I have to preach to
[41:19] myself what I get up here behind this
[41:23] sacred desk and say I also have to
[41:25] believe I have to live it I have to
[41:29] surrender to it I know that so a
[41:34] minister of the gospel has a much much
[41:38] more difficult line to walk because not
[41:42] only does he have to preach it he has to
[41:45] live it that's how God begins to deliver
[41:50] a greater revelation to you and I he
[41:57] will not give us any more than we can
[42:02] take so just how much can you take
[42:07] we need to lose ourselves now that
[42:10] doesn't mean we become psychotic it
[42:16] doesn't mean we become watch this an
[42:18] isolationist Oh see that's what this
[42:22] selfie age leads to doesn't it me myself
[42:25] and I and that's all there is and that's
[42:29] all there needs to be and that's all
[42:31] there's gonna be that's the age we live
[42:32] in
[42:33] well I want everybody to understand
[42:36] something Satan is not a creator do you
[42:42] believe that Satan is not a creator then
[42:47] where in the world did that spirit come
[42:51] from that spirit has to be a perversion
[42:54] of something real and I'm gonna tell you
[42:59] what it is he said I am God I changed
[43:06] not I'm one God and there will be no
[43:09] other gods before me that's where this
[43:14] age spirit came from it's just perverted
[43:19] all right so first of all I'd like to
[43:26] say that to me the message of the hour
[43:32] that you and I claim to believe notice I
[43:37] said you and I so no feelings hurt okay
[43:41] is not a different subject matter than
[43:49] this Bible I want to make that clear
[43:53] before I go any further what the message
[43:57] of the hour represents to me now is
[44:00] there any brothers and or sisters in
[44:03] here that have ever looked at a set of
[44:05] blueprints for a house for a building a
[44:09] schematic for instance and then I know
[44:14] there are probably brothers in here who
[44:15] have attempt
[44:18] to remodel or build and I only use the
[44:22] word attempted because it doesn't always
[44:23] work out you know III I was a carpenter
[44:28] for many years and then I became a
[44:30] mechanic because I couldn't swing a
[44:31] hammer anymore properly
[44:34] wore myself out and IIIi can see now
[44:39] that this this these little cute little
[44:42] signs that you buy down at Hobby Lobby
[44:47] have truth in them right away I saw sign
[44:52] there that said this is my labor rate
[44:55] okay 45 dollars an hour and this is my
[44:59] labor rate if you worked on it that's
[45:04] fifty five dollars an hour and this is
[45:07] my labor rate if it didn't work out for
[45:10] you that's seventy five dollars an hour
[45:13] and this is my labor rate if you try to
[45:15] help me it's a hundred dollars an hour
[45:17] and the reason that I say that is
[45:20] because that's the world we live in
[45:22] we're always trying to put our hands on
[45:27] something we're not qualified to do but
[45:32] because of the dy I sorry brother Samuel
[45:37] and and sister Peggy but it comes to
[45:39] mind chip and Joanna they're really good
[45:44] at marketing their stuff and they're
[45:47] probably really good at doing what they
[45:49] do but they make it look so easy it
[45:55] wasn't that long ago when I was doing a
[45:56] little remodeling and a lady asked me
[45:59] she said could you do my bathroom
[46:02] remodel my bathroom and she showed me
[46:04] some pictures out of you know Better
[46:06] Homes and Gardens and out of the
[46:07] do-it-yourself magazine and so forth and
[46:09] she said you know and I saw this this
[46:12] couple do it it wasn't chipping Joanna I
[46:13] saw this couple do it on the television
[46:16] and they and all it turned out so nice
[46:21] so I looked over the material list and I
[46:24] looked over and then I measured the
[46:25] existing bathroom and I had some
[46:28] questions written down a night and I
[46:30] said okay that's that's that's gonna
[46:32] cost about $6,500 and she said well how
[46:40] much do you charge per hour and I said
[46:43] well I I mean you know I averaged around
[46:45] forty fifty dollars an hour if I'm
[46:48] really doing good and I averaged about a
[46:50] negative ten dollars an hour if I've
[46:51] made a lot of mistakes it's true for
[46:57] anybody that works out there for anybody
[46:59] it's it's funny because it's true then
[47:03] she said but but that's outrageous
[47:06] she said it should only take you about
[47:08] three hours this is a true story I said
[47:13] what do you mean ma'am I said I got to
[47:15] tear this out and I got to do this and I
[47:16] got to redo the plumbing and I gotta put
[47:18] this curb over here build this and then
[47:20] I gotta lay this that's gonna take me
[47:21] about six weeks she said no sir I saw it
[47:25] on the television they did this whole
[47:27] job in three hours and there was
[47:31] commercials in between
[47:36] brothers and sisters that's the world we
[47:38] live in that's the way we're trying to
[47:42] find our way through God's Word
[47:46] come on now I want it right now Lord I'm
[47:54] going I'm going somewhere with it all
[47:57] right so so to me the endtime message
[48:01] the words that God gave to you and I you
[48:07] notice I didn't say gave them to William
[48:09] rather the words of God that he gave to
[48:14] you and I through William Branham
[48:18] because he was an instrument that God
[48:21] chose to use to speak to you and I now a
[48:26] lot of other people heard what he said
[48:29] but only one group of people is going to
[48:33] get to the kernel to the drain to the
[48:38] essence of what God said through that
[48:42] man now you and I may not be those
[48:44] people but I believe we can be I don't
[48:48] see any reason why we shouldn't be all
[48:51] right because it's going to boil down to
[48:55] if you say before this is all over
[48:58] but what we're struggling with
[49:03] is the fact that many of the things that
[49:05] you and I read and hear and see with our
[49:09] eye we begin to process and then our
[49:14] minds begin to engage and we begin to
[49:18] think there's our first mistake now that
[49:26] doesn't mean we should be I mean brother
[49:28] Branham didn't teach come up here to
[49:30] with a blank mind
[49:31] he said come up here with a repentant
[49:33] heart you come up to the altar with a
[49:36] repentant heart and if you're truly
[49:38] repented you'll go away with the
[49:41] beginning of the process of
[49:43] transformation that can take place in
[49:45] your life but I see the message now as
[49:50] something greater than I ever saw in the
[49:53] early part of my walk because I have
[49:59] held a set of blueprints many of you
[50:02] brothers have probably and a blueprint
[50:08] to the Christian is this book from cover
[50:13] to cover this is the plan of God this is
[50:19] the blueprint of God but what the
[50:22] message of the hour represents are the
[50:24] details your brothers who looked at
[50:29] blueprints see if I was smart enough I
[50:32] to give the brother of your thing to put
[50:34] up your blueprint and then we could have
[50:36] I could have shown you what a detail is
[50:37] but anybody who's looked at it planned
[50:39] knows that you've got this this
[50:41] one-dimensional drawing let me hold this
[50:47] back up you've got this one-dimensional
[50:49] drawing that you can read and that you
[50:53] can look at but very very difficult for
[50:56] most people to get this one dimensional
[50:59] drawing into three dimensions something
[51:05] tangible something that's got depth and
[51:08] breadth and height and width
[51:15] that's what the fivefold ministry is for
[51:20] God hath placed some with the ability
[51:24] that God gave them to anybody can look
[51:27] at a bit of blueprint anybody with
[51:29] eyesight can look at the blueprint
[51:32] anybody that can read can read the
[51:35] blueprint but it's the details and the
[51:39] details listen now on a set of
[51:42] blueprints are generally identified by
[51:45] symbols sometimes they're circles
[51:50] sometimes they're squares sometimes
[51:52] they're rectangles sometimes they're
[51:54] circles with rectangles in them or
[51:57] squares and them or diamonds in them or
[52:00] pyramids in them and I've preached this
[52:05] here already Revelation is a book of
[52:07] symbols what is this symbol something
[52:11] that stands for something else so a man
[52:15] that knows how to read the blueprint and
[52:19] recognize the details
[52:21] he says hmm my thoughts are not your
[52:25] thoughts my ways are not your ways but
[52:28] there's a symbol that's indicating to
[52:33] that person that he should look
[52:35] somewhere else in the blueprint for a
[52:40] magnified detail something that shows
[52:45] now listen here's the killer I'm gonna
[52:48] I'm gonna read the word magnified to
[52:50] help you okay so so a magnification is
[52:56] you're looking at the same exact object
[53:03] even the young people in here no has
[53:05] anybody ever put anything under a
[53:07] microscope in school or how about look
[53:13] through a telescope
[53:14] you look out in the sky you see the moon
[53:17] you see the stars but you begin to
[53:19] magnify it you're looking at the same
[53:21] moon you're looking at the same stars
[53:25] you're looking at the same leaf for
[53:27] insect that's under the microscope the
[53:29] same exact one no different no change
[53:32] but yet there's a power there that gives
[53:37] you the ability to begin to focus down
[53:39] or focus out and see much much finer
[53:45] details of the same exact object that's
[53:51] what the message of the hour represents
[53:54] it is the magnification remember what
[53:58] brother Branham taught us that Jesus did
[54:01] not come to break the law but he came to
[54:07] fulfill the law the scripture says and
[54:10] brother Branham said magnify he didn't
[54:14] come to do away with the law he came to
[54:16] magnify the law the message of the hour
[54:20] didn't come to do away with the
[54:23] blueprint it came to magnify it that's
[54:27] that's the very reason why for instance
[54:29] brother Samuel marriage and divorce I
[54:32] don't have a problem with it because
[54:35] first of all we can go to the blueprint
[54:38] right Paul said this over and Timothy
[54:42] Paul said this over here Jesus said this
[54:45] over here
[54:47] tied tightest oh we just keep looking
[54:51] but somehow through the age we live in
[54:56] they call it the age of consciousness
[54:59] men look at the blueprint and they begin
[55:05] to make their own details now did
[55:11] brother branham have to go and ask
[55:15] where's Paul's group
[55:19] thank you bye when he went beyond the
[55:21] curtain of time he said where I mean
[55:24] after listen think about it the
[55:28] tremendous ministry that brother Branham
[55:32] had been given by God to use and all of
[55:36] the things that happened the raising of
[55:40] the Dead the healing of the sick the
[55:43] discernment of the heart the creation of
[55:45] squirrels and on and on and on and so
[55:48] forth and he gets beyond the curtain of
[55:50] time you don't think you didn't know who
[55:53] he was but he wanted to make sure that
[56:00] he was using the original blueprint he
[56:05] wanted to confirm that the message that
[56:07] God gave him that he preached to leave
[56:10] to the likes of you and I was perfect I
[56:16] think it's interesting brother Samuel
[56:18] that brother Bentham didn't say well he
[56:19] did ask where Jesus was right and they
[56:21] say he's a little higher you can't see
[56:22] him right now
[56:24] hmm Jesus isn't here okay so now what do
[56:28] I do
[56:29] where's Paul where's Paul it's Paul's
[56:33] group here
[56:36] can you believe that brother branham had
[56:38] to ask that where's Paul I mean the
[56:43] tremendous ministry the tremendous
[56:45] amount of Word of God in Revelation but
[56:47] he still had to confirm a detail this
[56:54] Paul's group here yep
[56:58] and everybody in the congregation
[57:02] shouted out praise the Lord
[57:06] yeah where I preached what Paul preached
[57:09] he said we're resting on that so I was
[57:14] at one of those ministerial meetings one
[57:16] day bruh the way then they were all
[57:18] bickering over marriage and divorce than
[57:20] the ministry and I said brothers they
[57:23] didn't ask me I just said brothers there
[57:25] shouldn't be one question about merging
[57:27] divorce in the ministry not a lot whoa
[57:29] man they all got sided and they all
[57:31] looked over there like this guy thinks
[57:32] he knows a lot what kind of a big-shot
[57:35] is this I'm not a big-shot I said there
[57:39] are two details ones and Timothy and
[57:40] ones in Titus there shouldn't be any
[57:42] question and they kind of you know like
[57:47] what do you got a special special
[57:49] revelation on that no no no no brother
[57:51] Branham had to ask it's Paul's group
[57:54] here I'm asking
[57:59] I'm asking this pause group here yes why
[58:06] because he taught what Paul taught and
[58:11] there's no variation there's no
[58:15] deviation because you remember the
[58:18] friend brother branham had who had the
[58:21] dream and he was given a set of
[58:25] blueprints and brother Branham had been
[58:28] talking to him about water baptism and
[58:30] he just couldn't see it so he went to
[58:32] bed that night had a dream about man
[58:35] giving him a set of broop blueprints to
[58:37] build a house and this man began to
[58:40] build and apparently it was a good
[58:42] builder he didn't need any help he was
[58:43] doing it all by himself and he got to
[58:45] the part where there was like a bay
[58:47] window I think or something like that in
[58:48] the house and he said now it ain't gonna
[58:51] go that way I'm gonna do it the way I
[58:52] want to do it even though the product
[58:56] came out looking beautiful that product
[59:02] was not built according to the blueprint
[59:04] so when the man who he was building the
[59:08] house for came back he said what in the
[59:12] world are you doing hey check it out I
[59:15] built you a really nice Kingdom here I
[59:19] got this beautiful revelation right here
[59:22] and the man said that is not the way
[59:26] that I put it down tear it down and
[59:33] build it exactly like the blueprint now
[59:38] brothers and sisters that may not sessom
[59:40] seems like a funny story but that place
[59:42] was built as good as that man could
[59:45] build it the owner of that house picked
[59:48] that contractor because he knew he would
[59:50] build it correctly as far as the statics
[59:54] as far as the eye could see
[59:57] is there anything beyond the eye I'm
[1:00:03] gonna keep driving at it till it is
[1:00:05] there anything beyond the
[1:00:06] yes there is it's the thought that
[1:00:11] produced the drawing and when that man
[1:00:16] came back and he saw that his house was
[1:00:19] not built the way he put it down on
[1:00:22] paper
[1:00:22] he said tear it down and build it
[1:00:27] correctly and you all know the story
[1:00:29] that man woke up from that dream and he
[1:00:31] got brother branham and said let's go
[1:00:32] down to the creek I need to get baptized
[1:00:36] been thinking about it all wrong all
[1:00:40] right so now let's take your Bible let's
[1:00:46] look at a detail proverbs 23:7 most of
[1:00:51] you probably even know this one
[1:00:55] but let's see
[1:00:59] praise the Lord getting warm up here the
[1:01:02] heater is working good that's alright
[1:01:08] when you got its amen
[1:01:10] I can take my jacket off for as he
[1:01:15] thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:01:21] as a man thinketh in his heart brother
[1:01:24] Brad said so is he now as I mentioned
[1:01:30] the other day at brother Michael takes
[1:01:32] and I'll do it here because not all of
[1:01:34] you were here you know there's been a
[1:01:36] philosophical disagreement going on ever
[1:01:42] since the Greek philosophers began to
[1:01:44] argue with one another and I could
[1:01:48] probably get their names wrong and you
[1:01:50] could you could look it up and help me
[1:01:52] Plato and Socrates maybe the two guys
[1:01:54] their names are familiar and they argued
[1:01:56] you know they argued about where a human
[1:02:00] beings mind came from one of them said
[1:02:06] it's right here in this grey matter
[1:02:07] right here this is where you and I think
[1:02:11] and the other one said nah no there's a
[1:02:14] deeper thinking capacity than this up
[1:02:16] here and of course he he didn't mean the
[1:02:18] heart muscle but he meant the spirit of
[1:02:21] the heart of a human being and he said
[1:02:23] that's where a man thinks and they
[1:02:25] argued about it all the time now
[1:02:27] remember that's how Satan saw mankind
[1:02:33] because in the greatest battle ever
[1:02:35] fought
[1:02:39] God said oh you want to be not like me
[1:02:47] because God told us we should want to be
[1:02:49] like him
[1:02:50] is that right let this mind be in you
[1:02:52] that was also in Christ Jesus thinking
[1:02:53] it not robbery to be equal with God see
[1:02:55] the mind okay and but Satan wanted to be
[1:03:01] greater than not equal to and God said
[1:03:07] okay all right you want to battle
[1:03:14] I'll give it to you they said choose
[1:03:19] your weapon Saint instead I'll take the
[1:03:26] mind and do you know we're saying got
[1:03:32] that idea for Satan knew that the
[1:03:36] scripture said in the beginning was the
[1:03:38] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:03:40] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[1:03:41] and dwelt among us and when you take
[1:03:44] your Scofield Bible and you look in
[1:03:46] there and it says in the beginning was
[1:03:47] the logos is that right and the logos
[1:03:49] was with God and the logos was God and
[1:03:51] the logos was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:03:53] and then if you look a little deeper
[1:03:55] into the word logos you see it means
[1:03:57] thought or concept so then in the
[1:04:00] beginning the thought of the concept was
[1:04:04] with God the thought of this concept was
[1:04:07] made flesh so Lucifer with his
[1:04:11] intellectual value said I'll take the
[1:04:14] thinking capacity of man and I'll win
[1:04:19] take on the Almighty and once I gain
[1:04:24] control of the mind of man because he
[1:04:27] knew the word was going to be made flesh
[1:04:28] I will be greater than God himself
[1:04:36] God said yeah I knew he'd say that
[1:04:44] that's kind of the precursor to I told
[1:04:48] you so which we all used so often but
[1:04:56] God isn't doing it to try to prove to
[1:04:59] anybody that he's smarter than or knew
[1:05:02] more than he just knew Lucifer you pick
[1:05:05] what you picked and I'll take the heart
[1:05:09] that's what brother venom taught us I'll
[1:05:12] take the heart and for many years that
[1:05:16] argument ensued about where does man
[1:05:19] think okay you know this and then some
[1:05:25] years go by and science begins to
[1:05:28] dissect the human body and eventually
[1:05:31] they find out that there's this little
[1:05:32] place in the muscle we call the heart it
[1:05:40] has seemingly no value seemingly no
[1:05:44] function what's it for
[1:05:49] God speaks through a prophet and he says
[1:05:51] that
[1:05:54] is your heart that's where your soul
[1:05:59] abides that's where that little bitty
[1:06:03] light that God has ordained for you
[1:06:07] enters brother Branham said about the
[1:06:09] size of a body and I don't know if
[1:06:13] you've ever seen the dissection of a
[1:06:15] human heart but that little hollow space
[1:06:17] is about the size of an almond because I
[1:06:23] seen it I went and looked and I said wow
[1:06:27] that's tremendous
[1:06:30] I never disbelieve what brother Branham
[1:06:32] said but it certainly is nice to see for
[1:06:35] yourself
[1:06:36] is that right but what's really peculiar
[1:06:41] brothers and sisters about the Word of
[1:06:43] God is that there is something beyond
[1:06:46] the eye but very few people ever come to
[1:06:51] the recognition of it now I've got hours
[1:06:55] worth of material but I'm not going to
[1:06:57] do that because I didn't know how long
[1:07:01] brother samuel was gonna ask me to
[1:07:02] minister
[1:07:05] but my sole purpose and goal is for you
[1:07:13] to be able to see the details of the
[1:07:15] blueprint that pertain to you because
[1:07:21] that's what matters if we're preaching
[1:07:23] to or about someone else okay but how
[1:07:28] does that help me okay but how does that
[1:07:32] get me further into the kingdom god
[1:07:35] that's the very reason why and it's okay
[1:07:37] if I be blunt I'm sure that's the very
[1:07:39] reason why I struggle with the people
[1:07:41] who think that brother Branham has got
[1:07:43] to return to finish something even
[1:07:46] though I'm from the West I'm an oddball
[1:07:49] I'm a square peg my wife says in a round
[1:07:52] hole and that makes perfect sense
[1:07:56] because I'm a carpenter I can drive a
[1:07:58] round peg through a square hole you
[1:08:00] can't get a square peg through a round
[1:08:02] hole try it sometime
[1:08:08] and what it has to do with brothers and
[1:08:11] sisters is that of course then I've said
[1:08:13] this year and I am not impugning
[1:08:15] in any way shape or form the Prophet I
[1:08:19] mean III God is not a respecter of
[1:08:23] persons and we have to find ourselves
[1:08:27] with the mind of God how is that
[1:08:31] possible how is it possible for you and
[1:08:33] me to become a non respecter of persons
[1:08:40] you will talk about a greatest battle
[1:08:42] ever father you know we look at somebody
[1:08:46] we don't like the way they look we don't
[1:08:48] like the way they sound we don't like
[1:08:50] the way they talk we don't like whether
[1:08:52] they got here or no air more air great
[1:08:54] hair black hair their ears are big
[1:08:57] there's all kinds of reasons why we look
[1:09:00] at things and we make judgments Wow now
[1:09:06] I just don't like that guy why not I
[1:09:08] don't know I still like the way he looks
[1:09:11] come on we've all been in these shoes
[1:09:15] you're a real special person if that's
[1:09:17] something has never happened to you okay
[1:09:20] and even children you know I mean come
[1:09:24] on maybe they don't know why didn't know
[1:09:26] stay away from that they don't usually
[1:09:30] say it but they certainly do show it and
[1:09:35] it's because there is something beyond
[1:09:36] the eye and brothers and sisters the
[1:09:39] quicker you and I get to that place
[1:09:42] where we have a revelation I could use
[1:09:46] the word understanding but a lot of that
[1:09:47] throws a lot of people all brother you
[1:09:49] don't got to understand nothing well I
[1:09:51] have to agree with that because the
[1:09:53] Prophet said that but he also said to
[1:09:56] see us to understand so which one you
[1:10:02] have to be able to dovetail them both
[1:10:05] you can come to the Lord with zero
[1:10:10] understanding as a matter of fact you
[1:10:13] can come to the Lord with a lot of
[1:10:14] understanding but what God's going to do
[1:10:16] like he did Paul and Moses let's take
[1:10:19] you out into the desert a dry place and
[1:10:21] clean you out so you know nothing except
[1:10:26] Jesus Christ and him crucified of it
[1:10:28] when you get to that place then God
[1:10:31] begins to build and your understanding
[1:10:33] begins to expand and you don't become a
[1:10:36] theologian you become a child of God
[1:10:40] a son or a daughter of God why because
[1:10:45] God is dealing with you on an intimate
[1:10:47] level and he's beginning to take you
[1:10:50] into himself
[1:10:55] still with me I see the return word kind
[1:10:59] of shook a little bit a little water
[1:11:01] splashed in the boat but we talked about
[1:11:03] that earlier today we can bail that
[1:11:05] water out don't be afraid somebody who's
[1:11:12] taught right doesn't have to be afraid
[1:11:14] of anything except themselves you love
[1:11:21] him
[1:11:27] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:11:32] so in order for us to think the way God
[1:11:37] thinks then we have to have the mind of
[1:11:40] God is that right and the only way we
[1:11:44] can get the mind of God is to get rid of
[1:11:46] our own that's the danger that's the
[1:11:49] very place where most of us human beings
[1:11:52] begin to falter and trip because we're
[1:11:56] afraid of becoming nothing we're afraid
[1:12:04] we're afraid of the unknown
[1:12:07] I mean what if we become nothing and
[1:12:09] then he doesn't pick me up and use me
[1:12:11] [Music]
[1:12:14] that's human nature
[1:12:16] God knew that so God had a plan and that
[1:12:22] plan has details brothers and sisters
[1:12:25] you and I would still be arguing about
[1:12:27] the scripture without the details no it
[1:12:30] goes this way no that's a tuba 6 no
[1:12:32] that's a tuba 4 no that's the one before
[1:12:33] no that's ruff senior no that's redwood
[1:12:36] no that's pine no that's but go to the
[1:12:40] details and those details begin to
[1:12:43] reveal to you and I exactly the way God
[1:12:47] wants it to me in a nutshell that's what
[1:12:54] the message of the hour represents all
[1:12:57] right you still with me all right
[1:13:00] magnify to make greater in size status
[1:13:06] or importance it means to enlarge to
[1:13:14] cause
[1:13:16] to seem greater did you catch that
[1:13:21] that's why we're struggling with who
[1:13:26] sometimes the profit is I don't know
[1:13:29] brother I wouldn't say that if I were
[1:13:31] you
[1:13:33] brother branham was a man it was a man
[1:13:37] God used like I was going to say a
[1:13:40] minute ago while I don't want to esteem
[1:13:43] anybody higher than anybody else if you
[1:13:45] were to ask me from a human intellectual
[1:13:48] standpoint brother where do you place
[1:13:51] brother branham well I'd have to put him
[1:13:52] in top five top three Jesus Christ is
[1:13:57] number one well then the age we live in
[1:14:00] brother Branham would have to be number
[1:14:01] two I mean the age we live in now when
[1:14:03] if you lived in Paul's age uh-huh yeah
[1:14:07] brother Branham wasn't number two
[1:14:09] paula's you got me and that's the way we
[1:14:15] need to remember that God is portraying
[1:14:18] his word he's one God he's a jealous God
[1:14:23] and he will have no other gods before
[1:14:27] him not prophets not preachers not even
[1:14:31] you not me oh it gets tough done it it's
[1:14:39] a rough ride but I'm gonna tell you what
[1:14:42] this ride is doing brothers and sisters
[1:14:44] is building your character through all
[1:14:48] the ups and downs the ins and outs the
[1:14:51] bumps the scrapes the burns along the
[1:14:55] way God is building character now you
[1:15:00] and I think it's our character he's
[1:15:01] building I Got News for you
[1:15:06] he's bringing his character through you
[1:15:10] and me it's like I like to point this
[1:15:13] out to people even though I may have
[1:15:15] said it here now can you imagine the
[1:15:17] all-knowing omniscient omnipotent
[1:15:20] omnipresent God saying hey Adam where
[1:15:25] are you he knew don't you think he knew
[1:15:30] where Adam was but the reason he posed
[1:15:33] the question was not for himself it was
[1:15:36] for Adam now today in our lingo we'd say
[1:15:40] hey we're yeah brother yeah
[1:15:44] how about Abraham you don't think God
[1:15:47] didn't know brother Wade that Abraham
[1:15:50] was gonna sharpen the knife put Isaac on
[1:15:53] the pile of wood have a match ready and
[1:15:58] we am what we see is human beings with
[1:16:01] our own eyes because of television and
[1:16:03] and then and so forth in Hollywood is
[1:16:05] okay God wasn't doing that to see if he
[1:16:16] knew whether Abraham was gonna take
[1:16:19] Isaac or not he was doing it for Abraham
[1:16:26] he was doing it just for Abraham he
[1:16:30] wanted Abraham to know himself that at
[1:16:34] any cost he would even take the life of
[1:16:40] the promised oh that's the type
[1:16:47] cuz God knows everything I mean we're
[1:16:50] always Oh God is not flying by the seat
[1:16:55] of his pants
[1:16:57] God is not worried of whether this is
[1:16:59] gonna work out or not God is really not
[1:17:03] even contending with the devil the devil
[1:17:08] is just like one of them puppets
[1:17:10] well actually it's Pinocchio and his
[1:17:14] nose gets bigger all the time he just a
[1:17:18] puppet do we realize that the hardest
[1:17:23] part for us we see that we see that the
[1:17:25] devil's a puppet we understand there's a
[1:17:28] puff of smoke he's a tool in God's hands
[1:17:31] but can we accept that he is the tool
[1:17:34] that God is using to extract his own
[1:17:37] character through you and I it gets a
[1:17:42] little finer doesn't it but we're always
[1:17:44] blaming everything No
[1:17:47] brothers and sisters we've come to the
[1:17:49] hour
[1:17:52] where God is expecting sister looked at
[1:17:56] her watch when I said okay we're coming
[1:18:01] to the half hour you understand I mean
[1:18:10] it's time we think the world's gonna go
[1:18:13] on we got ambitions and we need we need
[1:18:16] a new house and a new car and we need a
[1:18:17] bank account and we need retirement and
[1:18:19] we need I got news for you they can take
[1:18:21] all that away from you whoop just like
[1:18:23] that no matter how well you're doing no
[1:18:25] matter how much money you've got and we
[1:18:31] look at the rich people and the
[1:18:33] Kardashians and you know what I'm saying
[1:18:35] all these people that are really popular
[1:18:37] new I'm gonna tell you what brother
[1:18:40] Branham said if they don't get save
[1:18:41] their cannon fodder I don't want to be
[1:18:46] cannon fodder there's something in me
[1:18:48] driving me for the end now brothers and
[1:18:53] sisters not no different than you matter
[1:18:56] of fact I may have further to go than
[1:18:58] some of you've got that's why I tell
[1:19:00] people I get up behind the pulpit
[1:19:01] brother Samuel I preach to myself
[1:19:03] brother I am preaching to myself because
[1:19:07] I realized that at the very end it's
[1:19:10] coming down to if you say it's going to
[1:19:13] go beyond the I so I'm gonna shift gears
[1:19:18] a little bit here before I begin to read
[1:19:20] a few things is that all right so let me
[1:19:23] do this how about turning to Genesis 1 1
[1:19:26] through 3
[1:19:32] you know when they were as an example
[1:19:35] questioning Jesus on marriage and
[1:19:37] divorce which whether you realize that
[1:19:41] are not brothers and sisters is the one
[1:19:44] subject matter that is going to make the
[1:19:46] biggest difference at the end as it did
[1:19:49] at the beginning because brother Branham
[1:19:52] said that he said just as the Satan
[1:19:54] Satan worked the way he did in the
[1:19:56] Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve Adam
[1:19:59] being a type of Christ Eve being a type
[1:20:01] of his bride or church he's going to use
[1:20:06] that same tactic at the end and whether
[1:20:08] you realize it or not he's employing it
[1:20:10] right now it's the natural marriage and
[1:20:15] divorce that you are focusing on with
[1:20:16] this I but it's the spiritual marriage
[1:20:19] and divorce should be concerned with it
[1:20:22] it's unbelievable how many people are
[1:20:25] committing spiritual fornication and
[1:20:27] adultery right now that doesn't mean
[1:20:31] that I'm preaching to anybody in here I
[1:20:33] just want you to understand that that is
[1:20:35] what's taking place people just don't
[1:20:39] realize it
[1:20:40] you go outside of God's Word one iota
[1:20:44] and you are potentially committing
[1:20:49] fornication and/or adultery with God's
[1:20:53] Word ouch this is getting pretty tight
[1:20:59] but the elect cannot be deceived you
[1:21:06] still with me so let's look at Genesis
[1:21:09] chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning God
[1:21:13] created the heaven and the earth and the
[1:21:16] earth was without void with without form
[1:21:20] and void and darkness was upon the face
[1:21:22] of the deep and the Spirit of God moved
[1:21:26] upon the face of the waters now the
[1:21:30] reason I read that to you and I haven't
[1:21:32] read verse 3 yet is when they were
[1:21:36] questioning Jesus on marriage and
[1:21:38] divorce he would constantly remind them
[1:21:41] that it was
[1:21:42] so from the beginning is that right for
[1:21:47] your Bible readers you know that's
[1:21:48] correct
[1:21:50] but then God sends a prophet in the
[1:21:53] twentieth century and that prophet
[1:21:55] preaches the message called
[1:21:57] that spoken word is the original seed
[1:22:03] right I believe that
[1:22:12] so what happened before the word was
[1:22:14] spoken you with me I'll just go slow and
[1:22:22] easy the spoken word is the original
[1:22:25] seat so what is the original seat the
[1:22:27] spoken word well Genesis chapter 1
[1:22:29] verses 1 & 2 was before the spoken word
[1:22:36] because it's in verse 3 he says and God
[1:22:39] said let there be light so here's what's
[1:22:45] really interesting to me up to verse 3
[1:22:48] there's no time he said oh brother
[1:22:53] God created where the Prophet taught us
[1:22:57] in his mind he said let there be light
[1:23:03] and brother Branham said it could have
[1:23:05] been a hundred million years and he also
[1:23:10] said that God had to believe his own
[1:23:13] word watch this I don't know if I gave
[1:23:17] the brothers this and I'm sorry if I
[1:23:18] didn't God's Word calls for a total
[1:23:20] separation from unbelief pages two and
[1:23:22] three God was going to use the earth are
[1:23:29] you earth God was going to use the earth
[1:23:35] and it was in total darkness oh praise
[1:23:41] the Lord brother Samuel that's me I
[1:23:44] didn't know God was gonna use me when I
[1:23:47] was in total darkness but because he
[1:23:50] said it it had to come to pass God was
[1:23:55] going to use the earth and it was in
[1:23:58] total darkness brothers and sisters I
[1:24:01] don't know about you but one day I found
[1:24:04] myself in total darkness what's the use
[1:24:09] what am I good for what are we doing
[1:24:12] here what's this what's the future hold
[1:24:14] what do you know all the questions you
[1:24:16] compose what what is it
[1:24:18] I don't know if he worked on you that
[1:24:21] way but that's the way it worked on me I
[1:24:22] thought I'd lived a full life when I was
[1:24:24] 21 years old later salmon you know I'm
[1:24:27] 21 and a half years old brother and I'm
[1:24:29] thinking is this it is this all there is
[1:24:33] to life you mean I've told this story
[1:24:35] before my wife knows that I'm sitting on
[1:24:37] my front porch before I got saved after
[1:24:39] I got off work one day in the summertime
[1:24:41] and a brand-new Cadillac and I lived in
[1:24:45] the neighborhood where they drove slow
[1:24:48] really this happened it's driving down
[1:24:50] the road and there's this really tiny
[1:24:52] small old lady driving the Cadillac and
[1:25:00] I said wow that's strange
[1:25:02] and her husband I suppose he was was in
[1:25:06] the passenger seat brother and he was
[1:25:09] all slumped over he couldn't even look
[1:25:11] over the - he probably had a bad back
[1:25:14] brother say I mean I don't know or
[1:25:15] osteoporosis or what I mean really this
[1:25:18] happened and I watch that cuddle I go by
[1:25:20] and I seen that little old lady driving
[1:25:22] it and I seen that man who probably
[1:25:24] worked all his life to pay for that
[1:25:26] Cadillac bent over and I said is that it
[1:25:28] is that what I got to look forward to
[1:25:30] you mean I'm gonna pound nails for 60
[1:25:33] years then be bent over so my wife can
[1:25:35] drive a Cadillac I mean it that's that
[1:25:40] God started working on me Ryan didn't
[1:25:41] know he was working on me right there
[1:25:42] brother Sammy he was working on me he
[1:25:45] started to work on the inner man I was
[1:25:47] in total darkness but I was the earth
[1:25:52] God was going to use the earth and it
[1:25:55] was in total darkness listen to this now
[1:25:57] the Spirit of God spoke out and said let
[1:26:02] there be light
[1:26:03] oh but that's not all and he separated
[1:26:06] the light from the darkness listen this
[1:26:08] is the kicker and it's been doing that
[1:26:10] ever since
[1:26:12] separating light from God
[1:26:15] did you realize brothers and sisters
[1:26:17] that what God said skilled doing that
[1:26:20] right now he's still separating the
[1:26:24] light from the darkness praise the Lord
[1:26:28] he's an eternal God he don't stop you
[1:26:34] know science got their formulas and
[1:26:36] their scopes and their thing oh no the
[1:26:37] sense what's the guy that just passed
[1:26:39] away that was in a wheelchair can't
[1:26:41] think of his name you know
[1:26:43] Hawkins Hawking not an eagle oh the
[1:26:53] sun's got a few more billion years to
[1:26:55] last and it's over man is only gonna be
[1:26:56] here another thousand years boy I
[1:26:58] wouldn't want to be in his shoes right
[1:26:59] now because if you say sealed his own
[1:27:08] testimony think about what he said man's
[1:27:13] gonna be here about another thousand
[1:27:14] years after the loom there's gonna be a
[1:27:16] white throne judgment I would hate to be
[1:27:18] that because what he did essentially is
[1:27:22] he stopped
[1:27:27] separating light from darkness it's the
[1:27:34] age we live in
[1:27:35] we've got so much information we got so
[1:27:39] many gadgets we got so much stuff we got
[1:27:42] so much information oh brother I just
[1:27:44] read the other day see then it's not a
[1:27:50] sin for you to read the news but the
[1:27:54] news is awfully sinful I mean come on
[1:28:00] there's only any good thing at it but we
[1:28:02] got the good news did you know that it's
[1:28:07] intimidated as we are and it's
[1:28:09] apprehensive as we are in this world we
[1:28:12] live in the whole world is craving for
[1:28:15] the good news that you and I got but
[1:28:18] we're intimidated to share it well oh
[1:28:21] that's how do we say it that's
[1:28:23] unpolitical e incorrect that's too
[1:28:27] negative so that's a positive think
[1:28:33] about it that's that's what that's the
[1:28:36] world we live in or so who don't say
[1:28:40] nothing well it's probably good that you
[1:28:42] didn't because when they were trying to
[1:28:43] accuse Jesus of being oh so you say
[1:28:47] you're the son of God are you didn't
[1:28:51] have to tell him cuz he knew who he was
[1:28:57] we don't have to boast not if we know
[1:29:01] who we are ain't no boasting going on
[1:29:03] the only way brothers and sisters you
[1:29:05] and I are gonna know where we are is to
[1:29:08] go beyond the I you with me
[1:29:13] should I read the rest of it well I know
[1:29:18] I have time but the next paragraph page
[1:29:24] 3 or the next paragraph I got written
[1:29:26] down on page 4 and when the word of God
[1:29:27] has been a vindicated the word been a
[1:29:30] vindicated that is light
[1:29:33] now the word itself now I want you to
[1:29:36] catch something you can read it out if
[1:29:37] you want but I'm gonna preach to you on
[1:29:39] it so when God said let there be light
[1:29:42] and that began the process of separating
[1:29:46] light from darkness the only way it was
[1:29:50] defined as light was to have it a
[1:29:54] vindicated here with me okay
[1:29:58] now the word it's a watch where he goes
[1:30:01] now the word itself oh oh this shakes
[1:30:06] people to the core the word itself isn't
[1:30:11] light did you say that is that up there
[1:30:19] I don't want you to think I'm making
[1:30:21] another
[1:30:25] now the word itself isn't light until
[1:30:30] it's a vindicated light if God said let
[1:30:36] there be light and there was no light
[1:30:39] then it wasn't the Word of God now
[1:30:43] brothers and sisters think about it
[1:30:44] think about if it took a thousand years
[1:30:48] or a thousand million years and God said
[1:30:51] let there be light and light didn't pop
[1:30:54] up the minute he said it lucifer began
[1:30:56] to think he's not God that's the same
[1:31:03] thing people are doing with the message
[1:31:04] of the hour
[1:31:05] well the Prophet said this and the
[1:31:07] Prophet said that the Prophet said this
[1:31:08] and they began to take their microscopes
[1:31:10] and their telescopes and they began to
[1:31:11] bear down on look I didn't go look man
[1:31:13] it isn't happening no it's not happening
[1:31:15] in your life but don't you dare think it
[1:31:19] might not be happening in someone else's
[1:31:22] that's the very reason brothers and
[1:31:24] sisters that people are yearning and
[1:31:27] burning and crying and praying for the
[1:31:30] return of the Prophet because they can
[1:31:32] read the prophets word they can read the
[1:31:34] message of the hour they can read the
[1:31:36] prophecies with their eye in the Bible
[1:31:39] but then after some time and sometimes
[1:31:42] this happens over a thirty careful
[1:31:45] brothers and sisters are 40 or 50 year
[1:31:46] period as we begin to get older and
[1:31:51] break down and our lives haven't begun
[1:31:54] or haven't finished producing everything
[1:31:57] that we see intellectually in the word
[1:31:59] we go maybe it's not so you know I
[1:32:02] thought I had the Holy Ghost brother but
[1:32:03] this ain't happening to me yeah
[1:32:06] and so what do people do fall back and
[1:32:10] punt that's what I call it they fall
[1:32:14] back and they say in in themselves well
[1:32:17] if I can't produce it somebody's going
[1:32:19] to watch how close it is now it's so
[1:32:22] closer to deceive their very elected if
[1:32:23] I can't do it somebody's going to do it
[1:32:25] and the only person I can trust is the
[1:32:27] Prophet I don't trust the Prophet I
[1:32:33] trust God they use the Prophet do you
[1:32:38] understand that it's a fine line isn't
[1:32:40] it who that brother said something
[1:32:42] that's blasphemous I can tell spiritual
[1:32:45] you know who that's blasphemy is it I'll
[1:32:51] tell you what blasphemy is the worship
[1:32:53] the man and not the Creator to mistake
[1:32:58] who that man is
[1:32:59] and it didn't have to be William Branham
[1:33:02] it could be anybody
[1:33:06] I like to say it like this how many of
[1:33:10] you in this room tonight and on the
[1:33:13] hookup would have believed Isaiah 740
[1:33:20] years later come on now I realize we're
[1:33:27] believers so we'd say well I would have
[1:33:29] believed it brother Branham said if you
[1:33:33] lived in the days of Jesus you would
[1:33:39] have treated him the same way you treat
[1:33:42] him today and he's the word made flesh
[1:33:46] not just a benevolent man that hands out
[1:33:50] cookies gives out money and answered
[1:33:53] most of us think God is a slot machine
[1:33:57] we put prayers in we pull the handle and
[1:34:00] we expect every time my wife we're
[1:34:05] talking about an incident that happened
[1:34:06] here to her and I and and she said
[1:34:08] something to me and I said honey
[1:34:09] sometimes and I'm not quoting Garth
[1:34:12] Brooks sometimes the best thing God can
[1:34:21] do it's nothing
[1:34:27] do you remember when the Prophet was
[1:34:30] told by the angel of the Lord listen
[1:34:33] this is what I want you to do and
[1:34:36] brother Branham began to get picked on
[1:34:40] by those guys over an African no no no
[1:34:43] he could he could have said I'm going
[1:34:45] home I don't care what it cost but that
[1:34:49] human nature began to work on him and
[1:34:51] they began to work on him and they began
[1:34:53] to say listen man this can't happen
[1:34:54] without you but you can't go over there
[1:34:56] and you can and he saw the vision he saw
[1:34:58] a vision of what he should do and he let
[1:35:04] those men talk him into something else
[1:35:06] he nearly cost him his life and he
[1:35:11] pleaded God please I'm gonna die when he
[1:35:15] got home he had some kind of amoeba or
[1:35:17] something I'm gonna die man just God
[1:35:21] just told you not to do that yeah you
[1:35:25] didn't listen to me that didn't mean God
[1:35:28] didn't love him didn't mean God was
[1:35:31] gonna forget about it that didn't mean
[1:35:34] God was gonna leave him helpless God was
[1:35:37] teaching him a lesson have you ever had
[1:35:40] that happen to you I'm getting better at
[1:35:44] it brother way Lord
[1:35:47] Oh garnet I made a bad decision that has
[1:35:50] cost me the Lord giveth and the Lord
[1:35:56] taketh away now brothers and sisters
[1:36:01] that's just a phrase to many people but
[1:36:03] if you've lived it
[1:36:04] that phrase becomes white you see it
[1:36:08] becomes a vindicated in you and you
[1:36:11] become the light of that word you become
[1:36:17] the manifestation of it and you say wow
[1:36:21] okay well how about the good part
[1:36:25] I'm getting to that I got 20 minutes
[1:36:33] but when light sprung up it wasn't then
[1:36:36] it wasn't let there be light and there
[1:36:37] was no light than it wasn't the Word of
[1:36:39] God Wow
[1:36:41] that's what money people think because
[1:36:43] they just don't see it coming to pass I
[1:36:45] mean it's gotten so bad have you all
[1:36:48] heard this that brother Branham has to
[1:36:50] come back because he didn't fulfill
[1:36:51] Malachi 4:5 you oh yeah he turned the
[1:36:55] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:36:56] but he ain't turned the children to the
[1:36:58] hearts of the fire you too late what's
[1:37:02] happening me oh no brother the Seventh
[1:37:04] Seal hasn't opened oh maybe not to you
[1:37:07] but it's open to me you want to know I
[1:37:10] know that because that's our seal we
[1:37:12] live in the age of the seventh seal it's
[1:37:14] our seal I'll even take you a little
[1:37:17] further brother branham said the Holy
[1:37:20] Ghost is our seal now a lot of people
[1:37:24] look at it like this because they're
[1:37:26] linguists and they go well yes that's
[1:37:28] true the Holy Ghost is the seal and so
[1:37:31] it makes sense that he would say that
[1:37:33] because it's the seal of our day no he
[1:37:35] said the Holy Ghost is our seal personal
[1:37:40] pronoun possessive but because people
[1:37:45] think there's nothing left to do what
[1:37:52] are we gonna do when we get to the other
[1:37:53] side brother and sister sit around drink
[1:37:58] iced tea half a cup of sugar to a gallon
[1:38:01] a cup of sugar to a gallon two cups of
[1:38:04] sugar to the gallon that's southern tea
[1:38:07] out west we'd all be dying of sugar
[1:38:10] diabetes think about it we all think oh
[1:38:16] when we get to the other side what do
[1:38:19] you think you're gonna do when you get
[1:38:20] over there okay it's there's no end so
[1:38:24] you're just gonna lay down and sleep for
[1:38:25] eternity I want you to understand the
[1:38:31] God we serve
[1:38:31] he has no end
[1:38:34] therefore there's no end to revelation
[1:38:36] it's just that you and I are finite
[1:38:38] beings we're trying to think what are we
[1:38:40] gonna do when we get there I was
[1:38:43] witnessing to my cousin and he likes
[1:38:45] Harley Davidsons and he said if they're
[1:38:47] in Harley Davidson heaven I ain't going
[1:38:53] he'd said that and I'm thinking in my
[1:38:56] mind of course I'd I really didn't know
[1:38:58] exactly how to answer that back but I'm
[1:39:01] thinking in my mind well I guess if you
[1:39:03] want a harley-davidson that bad God will
[1:39:05] let you have one but why in the world
[1:39:06] would you want one
[1:39:07] they I'm a motorcycle mechanic and a
[1:39:10] bike racer before I was saved and Harley
[1:39:12] Davidsons we're always broke down on the
[1:39:13] side of the road dripping oil all over
[1:39:17] everything who was one of those
[1:39:21] well I'm with you brother first
[1:39:28] motorcycle I ever had I pushed it way
[1:39:29] more than I ever wrote it those that's
[1:39:36] true but see God used those instances in
[1:39:40] my life to let me get this far down the
[1:39:44] road and the look in his word and say
[1:39:46] wow there's way more to this than meets
[1:39:50] the eye
[1:39:51] we got to stop looking around for what
[1:39:56] we want to see and we got to put on the
[1:39:59] mind of Christ that mind is so powerful
[1:40:03] that if God lets me finish tonight
[1:40:05] you'll see that God is going to use you
[1:40:09] and I to do something that no one else
[1:40:12] has ever accomplished and I'm gonna say
[1:40:17] I know this is gonna woo this is a
[1:40:19] curveball coming in here we're gonna do
[1:40:21] something that not even the man Christ
[1:40:23] Jesus did know blaspheme brother I know
[1:40:30] well you know what I mean that people
[1:40:32] are the prophet of God said that Jesus
[1:40:37] himself did not know the seventh seal
[1:40:40] didn't he
[1:40:45] well you and I live in the hour where
[1:40:49] you can now that is not impugning Christ
[1:40:53] Jesus it's to understand that he was God
[1:40:58] manifest in the flesh but that part of
[1:41:02] God that he was going to keep secret
[1:41:04] from everybody every angel even his own
[1:41:08] son why why brother Samuel was he gonna
[1:41:11] keep it from his own son because a son
[1:41:14] had a beginning and there was part of
[1:41:17] him so that's why the son couldn't know
[1:41:23] it because that part but the God in the
[1:41:26] son all he knew the beginning from the
[1:41:30] end he had no beginning and he had no
[1:41:33] heir you know that Melchizedek that was
[1:41:35] living in him but Jesus was also a man
[1:41:39] he was a human being like you and me I
[1:41:42] mean you think well okay so he's the
[1:41:45] second Adam yes
[1:41:48] think about this brother Branham says in
[1:41:51] the spoken word is the original seed
[1:41:53] that while Adam was the god of the earth
[1:41:56] he did not know how to produced the
[1:42:01] promise of replenish and multiply it's
[1:42:04] in the spoken word as the original seed
[1:42:05] you can read it yourself he said Adam
[1:42:07] hadn't come to that yet but because
[1:42:10] Satan was using the serpent and the
[1:42:16] serpent was already multiplying cuz he
[1:42:22] was a beast he was an animal but he had
[1:42:25] a place for a soul brother branham
[1:42:26] taught us we would have never known had
[1:42:28] it not been for the detail we would have
[1:42:32] never known there were people I've heard
[1:42:34] before brother Branham ever came on the
[1:42:35] scene that would preach the Serpent's
[1:42:37] seed but without revelation because they
[1:42:41] didn't have the detail they understood
[1:42:44] that much of the blueprint but they
[1:42:45] didn't have the detail the serpent had a
[1:42:48] place for a soul because he was made so
[1:42:51] close like mankind brother Branham tells
[1:42:54] us in questions and answers in genesis
[1:42:56] that that man
[1:42:58] was a beast genesis 2:7 we know that we
[1:43:03] know he's animal life so here's the
[1:43:05] serpent over here bringing forth the
[1:43:08] promise of God the commandment of God
[1:43:11] replace your multiply bring forth after
[1:43:14] your own kind and Satan enters in to the
[1:43:18] Beast and he begins to use him and that
[1:43:20] beast begins to talk to the church
[1:43:24] listen Eve
[1:43:27] tell me again what God said half God not
[1:43:31] said tell me again what he said listen
[1:43:34] to that tape over and tell me what you
[1:43:35] think so so she she sees she gets the
[1:43:39] Word of God on it she says well he said
[1:43:41] replenish and multiply it and I'm gonna
[1:43:43] tell you what tactic the serpent used of
[1:43:45] course it was the devil he said um
[1:43:47] where's your children
[1:43:52] sly is wait how come you're not
[1:43:56] producing this is a commandment and a
[1:44:01] promise of God and you're not producing
[1:44:03] it isn't the devil sly
[1:44:06] isn't he telling you and I that we
[1:44:08] listen to the message we read the Bible
[1:44:10] we listened we read the message we
[1:44:12] listened to it and we're in in the
[1:44:15] devil's got you said you see you're not
[1:44:16] exactly all the way there yet because
[1:44:19] you're not producing of these signs
[1:44:20] shall follow them that believe brother
[1:44:22] wait and I were talking about that today
[1:44:24] we'll just get somebody hire them and
[1:44:25] put a sign that's the way we think we
[1:44:31] will have signs and wonders and miracles
[1:44:33] following us oh I believe in signs
[1:44:35] wonders and miracles I'm gonna tell you
[1:44:37] all something you're looking at one
[1:44:38] right now if I told you the story of my
[1:44:41] life
[1:44:42] you would think I was the biggest liar
[1:44:43] that ever walked the face of it I have
[1:44:47] been in accidents I have been I have had
[1:44:49] a gun put to my forehead and the trigger
[1:44:51] pulled you see a scar it didn't go off
[1:45:01] and you could tell me things that have
[1:45:03] happened to you through your life and
[1:45:05] Satan begins to say you you you you you
[1:45:07] ain't got it you've walked down this
[1:45:10] road so far and you're not producing
[1:45:12] every word of God that's what the
[1:45:15] Serpent's here's a promise look what
[1:45:19] we're doing and you're not doing it I
[1:45:25] hope you get this
[1:45:28] if you don't you meditate on it you
[1:45:31] think about it and you see if it doesn't
[1:45:33] work the way that God is ministering it
[1:45:36] to you that old black dog is constantly
[1:45:41] whispering what about and then if if you
[1:45:47] love your brother and you love your
[1:45:49] sister and you realize that love covers
[1:45:51] a multitude of sin then it begins to
[1:45:53] work on you what about you
[1:45:56] Jobe had already taken care of business
[1:45:58] and the devil got a little bit upset and
[1:46:02] man this ain't working I guess God might
[1:46:05] be right in this instance a man is just
[1:46:07] a little bit more than I thought that I
[1:46:09] could handle so we went back went back
[1:46:14] to God and said okay one for you zero
[1:46:19] for me but I got another plan I'm gonna
[1:46:23] attack him from a different angle if
[1:46:25] you'll let me
[1:46:26] and God said all right
[1:46:31] you got to do this again go for it and
[1:46:36] he used job's friends family his church
[1:46:45] come on his wife that's the type of
[1:46:49] church use the church it was recently
[1:46:52] that some brothers that my wife knows of
[1:46:54] that I'm speaking of came to me and they
[1:46:56] said well we're gonna leave our church
[1:46:57] and we're gonna go to this other Church
[1:46:58] and and we're well we're gonna do this
[1:47:00] our own bang and blah blah blah and I
[1:47:01] said okay okay hoho let's go out to
[1:47:04] lunch let's sit down let's talk about
[1:47:06] this okay so let me ask you this
[1:47:07] question
[1:47:08] and I did I said are you leaving the
[1:47:11] church because the pastor's off the word
[1:47:14] you're not gonna believe what they told
[1:47:16] me brother wait they said no we're not
[1:47:18] leaving the church because the pastor is
[1:47:19] off the word oh I knew right then the
[1:47:24] devil was working I said then tell me
[1:47:27] why if the man's not off the word I
[1:47:32] better be careful you better be careful
[1:47:36] that's all I'm saying
[1:47:37] oh no brother there's not enough action
[1:47:41] going on
[1:47:44] did you all realize that brother branham
[1:47:46] never one time said give it the spirit
[1:47:48] test not once
[1:47:52] What did he say give it the word test do
[1:47:56] you know why because the life that you
[1:47:58] and I are looking for is not out in the
[1:48:00] universe it's in the word but that life
[1:48:05] has to be activated
[1:48:07] how by bringing it to pass that's where
[1:48:13] you and I come in oh I got ten minutes
[1:48:15] left I better go I'm gonna put that
[1:48:18] aside then well cut to the chase in the
[1:48:24] message and I know this just blows me
[1:48:26] away the way these come in the word
[1:48:28] became flesh you know it as the India
[1:48:31] report y'all know I know I'm not
[1:48:37] teaching babies here what is a word he
[1:48:42] says a word is the manifestation of a
[1:48:46] thought I'll get him
[1:48:53] it's an expression of a thought then he
[1:48:57] asks this question is that right is he
[1:49:00] just asking me or is he asking you is he
[1:49:02] asking the congregation is that right
[1:49:07] the congregation says right here before
[1:49:16] you say anything subconsciously you
[1:49:19] think it before you speak it is that
[1:49:23] right that's why I read Genesis 1:1 and
[1:49:27] 2 to you cuz he spoke yet it was in his
[1:49:32] conscience he says so in the beginning
[1:49:35] was the word that's as far as we can go
[1:49:38] back by this by theology but before the
[1:49:42] word was in was a thought and a thought
[1:49:45] was made manifest he says you see what I
[1:49:47] mean first he thought and he spoke the
[1:49:51] word and the Word was made manifest
[1:49:54] oh how infallible God is notice every
[1:49:57] thought when it's spoken a little lower
[1:50:00] down he says every word in the Bible is
[1:50:02] God's thoughts laying in seed form that
[1:50:06] if received into the human being and
[1:50:11] spoke by the same thought that
[1:50:16] materialized the Bible brings the thing
[1:50:20] to pass see what I mean
[1:50:23] how powerful could the church be the
[1:50:28] Bible said let this mind that was in
[1:50:31] Christ being you as a man thinketh in
[1:50:34] his heart so is he
[1:50:35] now your thoughts if they become
[1:50:39] expression he says like God said let
[1:50:43] there be a world before it could be a
[1:50:44] word it had to be a thought so God and
[1:50:47] the creation created the world by his
[1:50:50] thought
[1:50:54] and the thought expressed became
[1:50:57] material he says see what I mean now if
[1:51:00] that same spirit that said let there be
[1:51:03] light and then he said pauses he said
[1:51:06] and there was light and said let there
[1:51:10] be trees and there was trees and if that
[1:51:14] same mind that was in Christ being you
[1:51:17] how much could it I like the way says it
[1:51:20] he doesn't say how much could you say he
[1:51:23] says how much could it say let there be
[1:51:26] no cancer I'm reading what he I let
[1:51:30] there be no cancer and it would be gone
[1:51:34] now brothers and sisters if you apply
[1:51:36] that same principle to anything going on
[1:51:38] in your life I don't care if it's
[1:51:40] sickness or material a relationship or
[1:51:43] church or neighbor or worker whatever it
[1:51:46] is because I'll tell you what in this
[1:51:50] day and age a lot of things can happen
[1:51:52] to us but when the word cancer comes up
[1:51:57] you know I've known a lot of people that
[1:51:59] have gotten cancer and their entire life
[1:52:01] has changed they don't care about
[1:52:03] nothing else but living and if God
[1:52:06] permits them to overcome the cancer
[1:52:11] they're different because they say they
[1:52:15] got a second chance you ever heard that
[1:52:20] listen now let the blind eyes be opened
[1:52:24] and it would be so there this is the
[1:52:27] last sentence it's your thought Jesus
[1:52:31] said I'm going to I want to read to how
[1:52:35] powerful the the mind of Christ is in
[1:52:38] you a human being can be changed from a
[1:52:43] pig to a lamb because he's got a soul
[1:52:49] made in the image of God his thoughts
[1:52:52] change something does it for him
[1:52:55] hallelujah that's a man thinketh in his
[1:52:57] heart see Christ the Creator come to him
[1:53:02] in a steel
[1:53:04] form and created his own spirit took the
[1:53:08] man's natural way to love dancing and
[1:53:12] the world and carrying on and from that
[1:53:17] time he just laid it aside and was
[1:53:20] hungry after God and God was in him all
[1:53:25] the time I didn't say he said but I
[1:53:30] believe it cuz I can see it it was God
[1:53:33] in the beginning see there you are a man
[1:53:36] as a man thinketh it has become a
[1:53:40] thought before it can become a word and
[1:53:44] a word expressed materializes I believe
[1:53:48] in my heart that I am a Christian
[1:53:50] because I have accepted the Lord Jesus
[1:53:53] Christ if I don't cry if I don't move if
[1:53:58] I don't do a thing in my heart first I
[1:54:02] believe that Christ died for me in my
[1:54:05] stead amen
[1:54:08] I accepted as a Christian I believe it
[1:54:11] as a Christian then it's in my heart
[1:54:14] then I express it in a word watch how
[1:54:18] powerful this is I am a Christian that's
[1:54:23] the expression in a word living as a
[1:54:26] Christian being as a Christian and by my
[1:54:29] fruits I'm recognized by the world as a
[1:54:32] Christian hallelujah says we are
[1:54:36] Christians by faith it's beyond the eye
[1:54:43] all right I got four minutes left I like
[1:54:50] to be obedient hang on I don't have to
[1:54:56] read that to you cuz you already know
[1:54:57] that let me read this with you y'all
[1:55:00] know these I'm not reading anything you
[1:55:02] don't know I'm just kind of like Jesus
[1:55:04] on the road to emmaus I'm kind of like
[1:55:08] Peter you know what Peter said I I got
[1:55:11] to remind you of the things that you
[1:55:13] already know Jesus had went back to
[1:55:17] Genesis and began to talk and walk with
[1:55:19] them and remind them of all of the thing
[1:55:21] old fools and slow of heart to believe
[1:55:22] not all that the prophets and he went
[1:55:26] back and he began to teach them from the
[1:55:28] beginning and brought them up they
[1:55:29] already knew all that stuff they just
[1:55:31] forgot yeah they just they just lost it
[1:55:35] somewhere along the way and what was
[1:55:38] really amazing to me is that was Jesus
[1:55:40] Christ walking with her that was the
[1:55:42] very word made flesh walking with Him
[1:55:44] and they still didn't recognize it right
[1:55:45] because they were busy trying to figure
[1:55:48] out what happened in Christ is the
[1:55:51] mystery of God revealed this is on page
[1:55:53] 15 of this version because there are
[1:55:57] different publications now God's great
[1:56:00] secret mystery God now God's secret
[1:56:03] mystery he had before the world began
[1:56:05] now back in the back part of God's mind
[1:56:12] guess what the reason why it's for you
[1:56:16] and I the reason God kept this all that
[1:56:19] time for you and I is simple because the
[1:56:22] first shall be last so this was in the
[1:56:28] very back part of God's mind it was the
[1:56:33] very last thing but it was the first it
[1:56:38] was the first thing that God decided to
[1:56:41] do to bring his plan to pass in the back
[1:56:46] part of God's mind we all know that when
[1:56:48] Moses said Lord I'd love to say it up do
[1:56:51] you really want to see me oh yeah I want
[1:56:54] to see you face to face there Moses take
[1:56:59] a look and the theologians have been
[1:57:03] scratching their heads for millennia
[1:57:05] what in the world why would he not show
[1:57:09] his face well in a way he was but it was
[1:57:15] by revelation it was hidden it was the
[1:57:17] great secret that God hid in the back
[1:57:20] part of his mind he was only showing
[1:57:22] Moses where he kept it fast-forward to
[1:57:27] you and I here we are today there was
[1:57:32] something that he was trying and was
[1:57:34] going to achieve so he so in his great
[1:57:38] mind he wanted these attributes to be
[1:57:42] expressed we all know this but brothers
[1:57:47] and sisters the reason why that it's
[1:57:49] come to a day where we're struggling is
[1:57:51] because we we need to realize that it's
[1:57:54] up to you and I to manifest it we're not
[1:57:57] waiting any longer on anybody else is
[1:58:00] there any more Elijah's coming well
[1:58:03] there's one more coming of Elijah I like
[1:58:06] what brother Mike price says I don't
[1:58:08] read in my Bible where it's Elijah
[1:58:09] four-point-five he comes five times and
[1:58:14] the next time he's coming now you can
[1:58:18] argue all you want if whether that's
[1:58:19] William Branham or Elijah himself but I
[1:58:21] believe it's Elijah himself because he
[1:58:22] lied to him something
[1:58:25] and he's got to couldn't find Moses but
[1:58:32] Moses knew where to find God that's why
[1:58:35] God saved him to the end because he
[1:58:37] already showed him the backside of his
[1:58:42] plan
[1:58:43] it's just that Moses didn't have the
[1:58:44] details
[1:58:47] we're reading the details right now you
[1:58:51] and I have access to things that no one
[1:58:53] else has ever had access to because God
[1:58:57] kept it in his mind
[1:59:01] page 31 and then comes the revelation of
[1:59:04] the mystery see now it has to be a
[1:59:05] revelation even though it's still a
[1:59:07] mystery what do we know about a mystery
[1:59:10] reading your Bibles in Matthew 13 if
[1:59:14] that right isn't that where brother
[1:59:15] Branham gives Scofield's definition of a
[1:59:18] mystery what is there a supernatural
[1:59:22] element still remains despite the
[1:59:26] revelation and we can the revelation of
[1:59:28] the church age is the revelation of the
[1:59:30] seven seals the revelation of this the
[1:59:32] revelation of Jesus Christ yes but
[1:59:33] there's still a supernatural element
[1:59:37] did you realize that's what the part you
[1:59:40] and I make up because this is
[1:59:42] supernatural no man can come up with
[1:59:44] this pardon me but oh please stand
[1:59:52] please stand yeah I'm not done yet but I
[1:59:55] want him to stand it's tough sitting
[2:00:01] there all that time but I'm closing and
[2:00:06] I'm not brother Jewell and then comes
[2:00:10] the revelation of the mystery to the to
[2:00:13] reveal what it's all that's a ll all
[2:00:16] been about where these little doctrines
[2:00:19] like Luther brought out catechism and
[2:00:21] everything else and Wesley brought out
[2:00:22] this that and the other and these other
[2:00:24] things he's talking about the day we
[2:00:26] live in and then Pentecost brought
[2:00:28] organization just the same Father Son
[2:00:30] and Holy Ghost brothers and sisters do
[2:00:32] you realize that many of the people that
[2:00:34] you commingle with in what we call the
[2:00:36] endtime message is a Trinitarian oh yeah
[2:00:40] they think gods up there and their
[2:00:42] brother branham is Jesus Christ and then
[2:00:44] the other guys is prophet I'll just say
[2:00:48] it like that oh hey you haven't run into
[2:00:55] their mean like a pit bull you know
[2:01:00] right away that's not the Spirit of
[2:01:01] Christ because even if you're correct
[2:01:06] you ain't gonna approach nobody that way
[2:01:10] you know our brother told me brother
[2:01:12] Samuel is come to me just now a brother
[2:01:15] that I know was personal friends of
[2:01:17] brother Branham he's still alive barely
[2:01:20] and he told me brother he said it's so
[2:01:24] true what Billy Paul said and I'm not
[2:01:26] impugning Billy Paul so don't nobody
[2:01:27] shut me down that you didn't know
[2:01:30] whether people were brother branham's
[2:01:32] enemies or friends have you ever heard
[2:01:33] that and when the brother was telling me
[2:01:37] that I got her revelation by the way I
[2:01:41] said then brother you didn't know if you
[2:01:43] was his friend or his enemy
[2:01:49] because you understand if you couldn't
[2:01:52] tell his enemies from his friends then
[2:01:54] who were you and to me that's like whoa
[2:02:02] then come back in the last days and pick
[2:02:05] up all these mysteries and clearly
[2:02:06] explain it reveal it why it's all the
[2:02:10] last days when this great mystery that
[2:02:12] God had in his heart
[2:02:17] is being revealed wait a minute I got
[2:02:20] one more then I'll close page 34
[2:02:25] what was once God's great secret you all
[2:02:30] know this great mysterious secret in his
[2:02:32] mind he's now put in the hearts of
[2:02:37] lovely livre oh come on that's you and
[2:02:43] me aren't we believers I am and you say
[2:02:50] well brothers in man I'm lagging behind
[2:02:52] here because I'm not picking up on this
[2:02:54] oh maybe it's still in the form of a
[2:02:56] seed yeah cuz God's Word is always
[2:03:01] hidden in seed for he says he's now put
[2:03:09] in the hearts of the believers and that
[2:03:10] is the body of Christ that's you and me
[2:03:14] let me go one more place all right thank
[2:03:18] you I'm coming watch this Christ is
[2:03:21] revealed in his own word now it's in the
[2:03:24] eye this is where I got this message
[2:03:26] from it's in the eye prophetic do you
[2:03:31] believe it I believe it this was 1965
[2:03:38] the Prophet had not passed off the scene
[2:03:40] yet so this is a true statement
[2:03:44] it was the prophetic it was the eye but
[2:03:48] prophet is not here today and people are
[2:03:51] arguing in and dickering and bickering
[2:03:53] and and causing divisions and schisms
[2:03:56] over what the Prophet meant cuz we all
[2:04:00] got what he said right here in black and
[2:04:03] white but they're missing the details is
[2:04:08] that right he says Malachi 4 and so
[2:04:11] forth there's nothing else left for it
[2:04:14] to come but him himself to step into
[2:04:17] that there is more than the it's the
[2:04:21] life of Christ stepping into the
[2:04:24] mystical body and raising it down
[2:04:27] through the ages did you know that I'm
[2:04:32] preaching to you tonight that that's
[2:04:34] your responsibility the whole Creole
[2:04:38] creations groaning its moaning for the
[2:04:43] manifestation sons of God watch this
[2:04:49] down a little further because I know I'm
[2:04:52] running out of time
[2:04:52] he says God how can a man foresee these
[2:04:56] things he can't do it it's God himself
[2:04:58] see it's it's becoming to a place and
[2:05:01] he's governed the body all the way
[2:05:04] through then the complete body of Christ
[2:05:06] is revealed in the form of a bride isn't
[2:05:11] that you and me I accept it I don't know
[2:05:15] why you wouldn't want to accept it that
[2:05:17] was taken out of his side like Adam did
[2:05:19] at the beginning now it's in the head
[2:05:21] time you can't see with your hands
[2:05:23] that's why I titled this is there
[2:05:26] anything beyond the eye ah there's one
[2:05:29] thing there's one thing beyond the eye
[2:05:33] and you'll have to have the mind of
[2:05:37] Christ in order to get it
[2:05:40] he says you can't see with your hands
[2:05:43] yet it's a part of the body I love the
[2:05:45] way says this brother wait watch he
[2:05:46] doesn't say you can't hear with your
[2:05:48] ears he says you can't see with your
[2:05:50] ears yet it can hear you can't see with
[2:05:55] the nose yet it smells you can't see
[2:05:58] with the lips though it speaks see that
[2:06:01] was the Pentecostal age but now it's in
[2:06:04] the eye time the seeing see now there
[2:06:09] isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye
[2:06:14] it's he says it's that right the next is
[2:06:18] the intelligence which is Christ itself
[2:06:21] who controls the whole body what is the
[2:06:27] hope of glory
[2:06:28] I wanted to entitle my message glory has
[2:06:31] a hope what is the hope of glory does
[2:06:34] anybody know Christ in you that's where
[2:06:38] we're at today brothers and sisters we
[2:06:41] got to quit playing around
[2:06:43] with ourselves he says no moving motion
[2:06:47] beyond that oh brother wait when I read
[2:06:49] that I Lord in my mind go the seventh
[2:06:51] seal the opening of the seventh seal I
[2:06:54] don't need to read it till you can read
[2:06:55] it to yourself at the end of the seventh
[2:06:56] series that's nothing moved
[2:07:02] nothing well that's simple that's
[2:07:05] because there's no moving part beyond
[2:07:07] the eye but you have an intelligence I
[2:07:11] have an intelligence are you thinking
[2:07:13] right now
[2:07:14] might be real quiet are you thinking
[2:07:16] right now I don't hear any hum as a
[2:07:19] matter of fact brother band said I don't
[2:07:20] hear the earth spinning around I don't
[2:07:23] hear the dew being drawn off the leaf in
[2:07:26] the morning by the Sun but it's
[2:07:27] happening nonetheless what is doing it
[2:07:30] what is holding the earth in its place
[2:07:32] what is spinning the earth around with
[2:07:34] no noise what is drawing the the dew
[2:07:37] from the leaves the intelligence that's
[2:07:41] what we have said to that man he said if
[2:07:43] you can tell me put a bucket on that
[2:07:45] fence post if you can tell me what
[2:07:47] intelligence tells that Sat to go down
[2:07:49] into those roots I'll tell you who told
[2:07:54] me that woman was gonna live it was the
[2:07:58] intelligence of God it wasn't a man it
[2:08:04] was God using the man in the office of
[2:08:10] the eyes now you and I can't see a thing
[2:08:13] without looking through the message of
[2:08:14] the art right we ain't Weir's blind as a
[2:08:17] bat without looking to the message of
[2:08:20] the hour but as we're looking through
[2:08:22] the eyes of God it takes the
[2:08:26] intelligence to begin to open that word
[2:08:29] up to you or you're just gonna become a
[2:08:32] theologian that argues with everybody a
[2:08:35] know-it-all
[2:08:36] isn't that the day we live in everybody
[2:08:39] knows everything
[2:08:41] oh brother I got the same quotes in the
[2:08:42] same Bible in the same book and the same
[2:08:44] message in the same but do you have the
[2:08:47] same intelligence yes let me get to one
[2:08:49] more thing I'm sorry I'm taking longer
[2:08:51] than I should last year I took less time
[2:08:53] than I should so I'm even in it out
[2:08:56] not on purpose brother Samuel now there
[2:08:59] isn't one moving faculty he says beyond
[2:09:02] the eye the next is the intelligence
[2:09:04] which is Christ itself who controls the
[2:09:07] book whole body no moving motion beyond
[2:09:10] that's
[2:09:11] everything else has moved he says but
[2:09:14] after the eyes
[2:09:15] there's nothing moves that's the Seventh
[2:09:19] Seal
[2:09:21] that's the third pole what is the third
[2:09:24] pole the opening and revealing of the
[2:09:28] word listen to this now this is in the
[2:09:31] message Revelation book of symbols and
[2:09:33] I'll stop many shall run to and fro the
[2:09:36] people that know their God shall do
[2:09:38] exploits in that day God's revelations
[2:09:41] to his church set still sets still
[2:09:48] little flock
[2:09:49] he says positionally stay where you are
[2:09:54] don't worry God is waiting and trying
[2:10:01] and pressing can you believe this
[2:10:03] brother Wade God is putting forth some
[2:10:06] effort I'm reading what the promise that
[2:10:10] God is waiting and trying and pressing
[2:10:13] to get at the mystery of God reveals to
[2:10:16] his church that's you and me
[2:10:19] that's me anyway that's what's a holding
[2:10:23] back the coming of Christ now and the
[2:10:27] great millennium is this great
[2:10:30] supernatural power that really lays
[2:10:33] dormant in the church brother Samuel
[2:10:38] when I read the word dormant I went to
[2:10:41] the dictionary God said look it up
[2:10:45] dormant fixed stationary marked by a
[2:10:54] suspension of activity silence there was
[2:11:03] no movement that's why the Seventh Seal
[2:11:06] is open to those who it was meant for
[2:11:08] and it's closed it's omitted to those
[2:11:13] who aren't supposed to get it how come
[2:11:16] God opened it in the first place because
[2:11:18] in order for God to make it accessible
[2:11:23] he had to open it but when God opened
[2:11:27] the Seventh Seal he realized by
[2:11:29] definition of the word open that he was
[2:11:31] making that vulnerable
[2:11:35] think about it think about it that's why
[2:11:37] he had to preach the bridge because he
[2:11:40] had to temporarily open up himself so
[2:11:44] that the that the secret that was in him
[2:11:46] could be access but not by the devil so
[2:11:50] he omitted it again he closed it but
[2:11:54] all's we needed was the opening of the
[2:11:57] Seventh Seal cuz brother Branham said
[2:12:00] did you realize that if science could
[2:12:02] invent it make the machine that voices
[2:12:05] are traveling through this room right
[2:12:09] now he said they could even pick up the
[2:12:12] voice of Jesus in one of the quotes so
[2:12:17] the words of Jesus are passing through
[2:12:19] this building right now but you have to
[2:12:21] have the device brother Branham called
[2:12:24] it a crystal and questions and answers
[2:12:25] on the seals that's white weight and I
[2:12:27] were talking about earlier
[2:12:28] brother Bantam said you here at the
[2:12:29] Tabernacle this isn't for you just be a
[2:12:33] good Christian live a good life believe
[2:12:37] it he said but God when he wants to send
[2:12:40] it will have something there to receive
[2:12:43] it so when that part of God was opened
[2:12:47] up and sent out brothers and sisters did
[2:12:49] you realize the revelation I'm preaching
[2:12:51] on right now I couldn't get this I
[2:12:53] barely made it out of high school and
[2:12:56] the only reason I made it at schools cuz
[2:12:58] I played sports
[2:13:01] but I realize that the revelation of
[2:13:04] Jesus Christ isn't how smart you learn
[2:13:06] it is now well-read you
[2:13:09] it is not intelligent you are it isn't
[2:13:12] how agitated you are its whether you're
[2:13:14] open to the information of God passing
[2:13:19] by the spirit through the room you with
[2:13:23] me all right
[2:13:26] there's more but i'ma stop yeah thank
[2:13:30] you god bless you
[2:13:32] there's there's much much more for you
[2:13:35] to access it's not just one guy getting
[2:13:39] up here and preaching a message it's all
[2:13:42] of you taking this so serious and you
[2:13:44] know what I've said this you think I'm
[2:13:46] wrong I'm okay with that but I want you
[2:13:51] to prove it I want you to go home get
[2:13:53] your Bible get on your knees get your
[2:13:55] message out I want you to read and I
[2:13:56] want you to study I want you to pray
[2:13:58] about it and call me and if you got a
[2:14:02] point that I don't see I listen to you
[2:14:05] because I know this brothers and sisters
[2:14:07] every single believer that God is elect
[2:14:11] in the hour we live in is going to
[2:14:13] receive oh the word because somebody's

[2:14:36] it father
[2:14:37] we realize that Lord intellectually Lord
[2:14:40] we hear it with our ears we see with our
[2:14:42] eyes but we realize there's something
[2:14:46] beyond the odds and it all boils down to
[2:14:51] the mind of Christ if we say you showed
[2:14:57] us Lord in a in a glimpse
[2:15:01] the prophet of God said there were
[2:15:03] people that were crippled there was a
[2:15:05] prayer list miles long and there were
