[4:19] let's bow our heads Lord thank you for
[4:21] this afternoon
[4:25] Lord the morning's done as we were
[4:27] thinking the other day
[4:30] when I wrote down 8 31 23
[4:35] . that's the last one we'll see
[4:37] there won't be another day every time of
[4:39] day he goes by that day is gone
[4:42] Lord I pray that you'll help us spend
[4:45] that day sometimes somehow praise in
[4:48] your name
[4:49] Lord either lift in our hands reading
[4:51] the Bible praying for someone speaking
[4:54] to someone helping someone in need
[4:56] because that day will never get back
[4:58] we'll never recover that Lord I pray
[5:01] that you'd be with each one Lord just
[5:03] bless us here now in September we've got
[5:05] a few months coming up around all the
[5:07] November and December hustle and bustle
[5:09] Lord let us not forget you but let us
[5:12] Lord make everything be centered around
[5:14] you
[5:15] and father just bless this day keep us
[5:18] safe give us their daily bread we were
[5:20] the ones that are sick brother Dale
[5:21] sister Dale Terence got all a little
[5:24] stomach trouble I prayed should be with
[5:25] him Lord touch their bodies just bless
[5:27] each one now in Jesus name
[5:29] Amen in the beginning was the word where
[5:31] it was with God and the Word was God and
[5:33] that word was made flesh endorsed Among
[5:35] Us he didn't mind that so I don't mind
[5:37] being in flesh and him being in me all
[5:39] right and he don't mind being in your
[5:41] flesh or if you'll let him and the Word
[5:43] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[5:45] beheld his glory the glory of the only
[5:46] begotten of the father
[5:48] full of grace and truth John 3 3 says
[5:51] Jesus answered and said verily verily I
[5:53] say unto thee except the man be born
[5:54] again
[5:55] he cannot see
[5:57] the kingdom of God
[5:59] then we're going to continue on with
[6:01] this thought a little bit from
[6:02] Revelations 19 6. and I heard I heard as
[6:05] it was The Voice
[6:07] voice of many of great multitude a voice
[6:10] of many Waters voice of Mighty
[6:13] thundering saying hallelujah for the
[6:15] Lord God omnipotent
[6:17] all-knowing King
[6:19] reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and
[6:23] give honor to him for the marriage of
[6:25] the Lamb has come and his wife has made
[6:28] herself ready you may be seated in the
[6:30] Lord has blessings and to her was
[6:32] granted that she should be a raid and
[6:34] find linen clean and white for the fine
[6:36] linen is a righteousness
[6:38] of the Saints you know you you read that
[6:40] scripture and you you it looks like
[6:42] we're going to get something there
[6:45] but thank God for a prophet that told us
[6:47] we're going to get our robe here
[6:49] we're not going to get our robe there
[6:50] when you talk about robes getting robes
[6:52] there you're talking about foolish
[6:53] version you're talking about
[6:55] um 144 000 you're talking about the
[6:58] souls under the altar they're going to
[7:00] get a uh uh not a robe of I'm sure we
[7:03] probably will be wearing white but the
[7:05] robe is robe of righteousness not a robe
[7:07] of cloth all right so the robe of
[7:10] righteousness when he gives you the new
[7:12] birth then he gives you that rope
[7:15] hey man
[7:16] because you're just as Eternal as God is
[7:18] if you're born again today so you have
[7:20] that righteousness but you still have to
[7:23] get yourself ready
[7:26] what it says and then she if you didn't
[7:28] have to make yourself ready we just
[7:29] become righteous no we have the
[7:31] righteousness of God inside of us but we
[7:34] do have a spirit realm that we have to
[7:36] work with and that Spirit realm is what
[7:38] we're working on now all right you must
[7:41] be born again there's no way around it
[7:43] there's no way to get by it
[7:45] you've got to be born again or you're
[7:48] lost there's no gray area all right but
[7:52] then as we get we're born again as
[7:54] newborn babies in Christ and we'll get
[7:56] to it maybe a little bit
[7:58] we still have to grow the Bible is
[8:01] always in a growth development it always
[8:03] talks about seed and it always talks
[8:06] about plants and it always talking about
[8:08] spring summer fall and winter and it's
[8:10] always talking about the evolving and
[8:12] changing of man
[8:14] God never changes thank God
[8:16] all right so he's he's steady he's
[8:19] constant but we change but he knows that
[8:22] we were going to change so he put that
[8:24] in his plan that he allows us to change
[8:28] but he compels us to change into His
[8:31] Image not change here on Earth but
[8:33] change into His Image we're definite
[8:36] Listen Listen by default you're gonna
[8:40] look like your parents
[8:44] oh my
[8:46] God by default by default you're gonna
[8:49] look like your parents
[8:51] and not by your fault but by default you
[8:54] are going to look like your natural
[8:55] parents but you have a you have a choice
[8:58] whether you want to look like your
[8:59] heavenly parents
[9:01] all right and then what does that do
[9:03] that changes us into that image puts us
[9:05] in a different family and then what it
[9:07] does it literally changes the way we
[9:10] look
[9:13] puts us in a whole different family
[9:15] you look at the family out there look at
[9:18] your family that's not born again
[9:20] you don't look like them you don't have
[9:22] the tattoos you don't have the earrings
[9:23] you don't have the makeup you don't have
[9:25] the cut hair you don't have the long
[9:26] hair you don't have the beard drinking
[9:28] or just you see what I mean even that
[9:30] even that little bit you've been
[9:32] separated
[9:34] and even though genetically
[9:37] you're not changed
[9:40] but you're changing your appearance
[9:42] because of what's inside
[9:43] hey man
[9:45] your appearance changes listen you can
[9:48] tell brother Louise and I were talking
[9:49] about something in here a few minutes
[9:51] ago and I'll elaborate on it but you can
[9:54] tell when something's wrong with
[9:55] somebody or when something's going on
[9:57] kind of a little bit off you can see it
[9:58] in your face
[10:00] you can tell it by your demeanor that
[10:02] because you know what generals say all
[10:04] right what's wrong
[10:06] because she's known me for 44 years well
[10:08] longer than that but 44 years we've been
[10:10] married she said what's wrong
[10:12] we got a problem what's wrong why I
[10:14] never have to say a word because my
[10:16] demeanor changes
[10:18] and yours don't okay well then it's just
[10:20] pray for me and sister Jim
[10:22] amen
[10:24] you don't have to say it so loud
[10:26] okay
[10:28] you got ear plugs down like Gina
[10:30] okay just hard of hearing okay
[10:34] remind me never to use that again
[10:42] but but I mean but we're changed into
[10:45] the kingdom of God what are we supposed
[10:46] to do God is supposed to and he will
[10:49] understand you better than you
[10:51] understand yourself
[10:53] right because you're not two separate
[10:55] people if you're born again you're one
[10:57] person June was born from a different
[10:59] family from me and word genetically
[11:01] we're different but coming together we
[11:04] brought forth children but God is Not
[11:07] genetically different from something
[11:09] else of his own self he is he can't
[11:12] genetic he can't I can't say un he can't
[11:15] uh he didn't go marry somebody and then
[11:18] have something that looked kind of like
[11:19] no God we were made in His image so
[11:23] anything he produces anything he
[11:25] produces is in His image
[11:27] and you know what praise God he can't
[11:29] help it either
[11:31] you or your parents couldn't help you
[11:33] I mean look at Ruth bless your heart
[11:37] she's looked like that for 40 something
[11:39] well she's not really that old you know
[11:40] maybe 15 to 20 years
[11:42] here we go I'm bouncing from this one
[11:44] somebody help me
[11:46] [Music]
[11:49] help him Lauren yeah before stuff starts
[11:52] getting thrown at me
[11:54] but but look at Ruth Ruth looks just
[11:57] like her daddy and mama kind of mixed
[11:59] but she looks a lot like her dad
[12:01] she always has
[12:02] she can't help that
[12:04] she can stretch pull you know
[12:07] get older you ain't got a wrinkle on
[12:10] your face stop it of course you know
[12:12] what your dad don't have any either so
[12:13] see you understand what I mean though
[12:15] you can look at that and say well boy
[12:16] that's that's the fan that's the
[12:18] Hamptons family why because they look
[12:20] like each other
[12:21] well now why can't we as the family of
[12:24] God when we come together
[12:27] look like each other
[12:30] and discern that you're either in the
[12:32] family or not now listen there are
[12:34] people in your family that you don't
[12:36] like to deal with too much
[12:38] I don't know why I looked at you Esther
[12:40] but bless your heart
[12:41] um
[12:43] I'll get over here and get somebody over
[12:44] on this side next time but there are in
[12:47] your family there's always that one
[12:48] cousin
[12:50] hey hey man there's always that one
[12:53] cousin
[12:54] you know do you know Terrence still no
[12:56] but I know Jim
[12:59] do you know Samuel my dad no I know
[13:01] Marshall well see there's always that
[13:03] one that stands out well same way in the
[13:06] gospel I don't know why I'm doing this
[13:08] but anyway but that's the way we are in
[13:10] the gospel
[13:12] we're all in the same family but we all
[13:15] have our different and I took it out but
[13:17] I should have brought it back in here
[13:18] our diversity of gifts
[13:21] all right our diversity of gifts is not
[13:23] like I was explaining the other
[13:25] Wednesday night you know if it said
[13:27] brother Louise gets a an unction from
[13:29] the Lord and he stands up and prophesies
[13:31] that may be the only thing he does his
[13:33] whole life
[13:35] never prophesy again that's a gift
[13:38] that's excusa that's that's something
[13:41] that that God has given him and then
[13:43] took back away from it but he can't give
[13:45] him the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[13:47] then take it back away from him all
[13:49] right so that puts us all in the family
[13:51] but we have diversity of gifts just like
[13:53] your hands and your feet they all have
[13:55] everything functions if you really think
[13:59] Even in our fallen condition our bodies
[14:02] are are almost perfect how can you get a
[14:04] machine to run for 80 something years
[14:08] even though we might have our issues and
[14:10] problems but that heart pumps and you
[14:12] don't even think one thing but you have
[14:14] never in your life ever had to say our
[14:16] heart our heart there might be times
[14:19] when you might have thought that in your
[14:21] head but you never had to say that why
[14:23] because God made a machine that was
[14:25] right he made a machine that was perfect
[14:27] a man
[14:30] but now we know we you know brother Kali
[14:32] right we're in a fallen condition and
[14:34] that heart don't pump it's actually like
[14:36] it used to pump but it still pumps all
[14:38] right and we're still here but we have
[14:40] diversity of gifts just like our hands
[14:42] and and your body is like a uh you know
[14:46] they tell you to use your legs and not
[14:47] your back well that's because there's a
[14:49] there's a mechanical connection with all
[14:51] that
[14:52] that God's built in what are you trying
[14:53] to say God built your body perfect now
[14:56] if he built your natural body almost
[14:58] perfect what about the spiritual body
[15:00] he's building
[15:01] he's building a spiritual body that's
[15:03] not like perfect it is perfect
[15:05] so when we get into this talking about
[15:07] the the placing of in in adoption is
[15:12] you're placing let's talk about that
[15:14] because you can just say placing well
[15:16] what is that
[15:18] that's putting you that's putting you to
[15:20] where
[15:21] if you're the finger
[15:22] you've got to be there
[15:24] as that finger
[15:27] you got to be something a part of
[15:29] somebody get their hand cut off we had
[15:31] an uncle that got his hand cut off
[15:33] well I mean he adapted but you couldn't
[15:36] shake his hand
[15:38] wasn't nothing there to shake
[15:40] right so the body was what the body was
[15:42] a little bit off
[15:45] same way with anything else it happens
[15:46] to your body if there's something a
[15:48] little bit off you maybe can't walk
[15:49] right or something
[15:51] that's the same way it is in the body of
[15:52] Christ
[15:53] we have become sold out of joint
[15:57] I've been I read it to you this morning
[15:59] Satan got into Pulpit he disconfigured
[16:02] the word he he got it all out of joint
[16:06] and we just kept it that way
[16:10] because God but God said I will restore
[16:13] I'm gonna put this body back together
[16:15] and this body is not going to be a so
[16:20] much as we look in our neighbor as a
[16:22] perfect body but it's going to be a
[16:24] masterpiece because remember what made
[16:27] that Masterpiece the Masterpiece it was
[16:30] the flaw on its leg is what made it the
[16:33] masterpiece
[16:36] bringing God through human flesh to
[16:40] defeat the Devil is the greatest
[16:41] masterpiece
[16:43] like I said we have Satan's answer we
[16:45] now know where God resides
[16:47] we now know what God wants it's not to
[16:50] just do we're trying to think that well
[16:52] I ain't perfect you ain't perfect you
[16:54] don't like the world and like I said
[16:55] before they can put Jesus on the cross
[16:59] they can get him off the cross
[17:01] they can get him Resurrected
[17:04] but they can't get them back inside of
[17:05] themselves
[17:07] huh like we were talking about um
[17:10] sister Regina or somebody was talking
[17:12] about reformation or reforming you don't
[17:14] reform you can't reform people
[17:17] denomination oh Kathy denominations that
[17:21] is Reformation like I said this morning
[17:23] they'll reform you you'll get into AAA
[17:26] or you'll get in there we don't reform
[17:29] people
[17:30] right the new birth changes you
[17:34] see that
[17:36] you're still what you were until you're
[17:38] actually born again you can suppress it
[17:42] you can push it down you can do a a and
[17:45] praise God for those people they have
[17:47] helped millions of people
[17:49] but
[17:51] I always say what's an alcoholic always
[17:53] an alcoholic don't get around it don't
[17:55] smell it because you may go back no I
[17:58] tell you what you get born again one
[17:59] time with the spirit of God you get the
[18:01] Holy Ghost in your soul and they can
[18:03] pour alcohol on your body and you won't
[18:06] want it
[18:07] that's the god I want to serve that's
[18:09] the god I want to take care and
[18:10] eradicate that not under Reformation but
[18:13] restore restoration to restore
[18:16] everything back
[18:18] not just the gifts
[18:20] I want the word restored in power back
[18:23] into our life because remember signs
[18:26] follow the Believers if you get to
[18:27] believe in part right science will
[18:29] follow you
[18:30] but you're still what you were until
[18:31] you're actually born again the new birth
[18:33] is an experience just like I said
[18:35] something that takes place
[18:37] all right it takes you out of a
[18:39] situation and puts you in another one
[18:43] remember out of and into right it takes
[18:47] you out of a situation and puts you into
[18:50] the family of God sure we still have our
[18:53] traits of our old family we have a
[18:55] traits of our old nature even from the
[18:57] Devil
[19:00] think about it
[19:01] in your spirit realm the devil can still
[19:03] somehow connect his self to your
[19:06] memories and conscious affection and
[19:08] Imagination but that's what we've been
[19:09] trying to say that but once you're born
[19:12] again in your soul Satan cannot touch
[19:15] that space it is off limits he can't
[19:17] even he even if he tried it burn him up
[19:20] you talking about a burning hell he
[19:23] ain't seen nothing brother Ryan said he
[19:25] hasn't seen nothing until he touched
[19:26] that 200 million bolt of Jesus on the
[19:28] cross when he was in the Tomb he said I
[19:31] got you buddy he said oh he didn't know
[19:33] what he got a hold of
[19:34] because Jesus came out of the Tomb
[19:37] well guess what where's that guy living
[19:39] at today
[19:43] where's he living today
[19:45] he's living inside of you you got to
[19:47] believe that though but you shall
[19:49] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[19:51] has come upon you because it will be
[19:53] I permitted power I kind of stuck this
[19:56] in from from the this morning there is a
[19:58] permitted power brother Dale many years
[20:00] ago preached on permitted power because
[20:01] Satan has no power
[20:04] he is powerless just as he has made the
[20:07] formal Church powerless
[20:10] he is powerless
[20:12] he cannot do one thing he can't move
[20:15] until God tells him he can
[20:19] praise God I'm glad I'm not on his side
[20:22] no more
[20:24] he's a loser
[20:25] but in Revelation 6 forces that went out
[20:28] another horse that was red now remember
[20:29] what is a horse horse is a power and
[20:32] power was given to him he didn't have
[20:34] his own power
[20:35] Revelation 6 verse 7 when it opened a
[20:38] fourth seal I heard the voice of the
[20:39] fourth Beast say come and see I looked
[20:41] and behold a Pale Horse what another
[20:43] power and his name that said on him was
[20:45] white death and hell even death and hell
[20:48] has no power God had to give him the
[20:50] power that's right power was given unto
[20:53] them over the fourth part of the earth
[20:54] to kill with the sword hunger death and
[20:56] beast of the earth Revelations 13 7 it
[20:59] was given unto him to make war with a
[21:01] saint given
[21:02] and to overcome them and power is given
[21:04] him
[21:05] overall Kindred tongues and Nations but
[21:08] not over the bride
[21:10] listen we're gone
[21:13] that's what makes him powerless to us
[21:15] but this world is all listen all this
[21:19] world is held under his control
[21:22] I don't care who you
[21:24] I'm sorry
[21:25] this is where you have to be you know
[21:27] you it has to be a separation if
[21:29] People's not born again they are under
[21:31] the power of Satan
[21:33] regardless
[21:38] two Powers that's all
[21:40] and one really ain't a power it's
[21:42] permitted
[21:45] but Paul was given over all Kindred
[21:46] tongue in Nations
[21:49] then brother Brian tells us trying to
[21:51] skip to I want to get to something here
[21:52] in a minute how the Antichrist Spirit
[21:54] now look
[21:56] coming to the church defile it make it
[21:58] look more formal and Powerless now
[22:00] remember it didn't come into the bar
[22:03] room
[22:06] it didn't come into the Juke Joint as
[22:08] for y'all that live in the country you
[22:10] know what a juke joint is all right
[22:12] because there was a jukebox in it and
[22:14] you played remember brother random went
[22:15] into one one time
[22:17] and he got spanked
[22:19] by the Lord
[22:21] for being a little bit arrogant toward
[22:23] that sister that was in there and the
[22:25] cop and all that other stuff so but that
[22:27] was the Antichrist Spirit would come
[22:29] into the church
[22:33] he's not in the listen if you have to
[22:36] worry about
[22:37] the bar rooms and
[22:41] you need to get bored again
[22:43] but what he's done he's come into the
[22:45] through the walls of the church
[22:48] and tried to make it defiled lukewarm
[22:51] formal and Powerless because as I'm
[22:54] fixing to tell you there is no power in
[22:58] false Doctrine
[23:00] God does not have to honor anything
[23:03] that's false
[23:05] now look he winked at the ignorance of
[23:07] of Luther
[23:09] Wesley you know why because he had to
[23:12] get us
[23:13] he had to get a group of people as we
[23:15] were talking about this morning the
[23:16] Bride of the end time had to come on the
[23:20] same
[23:22] according to the Bible
[23:24] so God couldn't cut it off at Luther he
[23:26] couldn't cut it off at Wesley he had to
[23:28] and you know what I mean by winking you
[23:30] know sometimes you somebody tells
[23:32] something or you know it's like that
[23:33] cousin that I was talking about you know
[23:35] you just go that's just Jim
[23:37] you know so I just said well he didn't
[23:40] say well that's just Luther no he he
[23:42] needed Luther during that time
[23:44] or he wouldn't have called him he needed
[23:46] Wesley during that time listen their
[23:47] bride they're waiting on us
[23:49] so let's don't belittle I'm not trying
[23:51] to belittle him but they had their place
[23:54] Satan crap then remember brother Brown
[23:56] said the messenger went off the scene
[23:58] Satan Creeps in puts a denominational uh
[24:01] sticker on it and they died right there
[24:04] well God didn't do it
[24:07] Satan crept into the church and blinded
[24:09] the people to this truth talking about
[24:10] the truth of one God and when they were
[24:13] blinded to it it wasn't long until the
[24:14] Church of Rome stopped baptizing in the
[24:16] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[24:19] Resurrection 1953 see I don't want to
[24:21] blame you people it's the pulpits where
[24:23] it started no wonder that's the
[24:25] damnation of the country when this is
[24:28] 1953
[24:31] you'd think they'd be a little brother
[24:33] Aaron they'd be a little credibility in
[24:34] 1953 people still went to church and
[24:38] wore the sister still wore dresses and
[24:40] and tried I guess to live a better life
[24:42] than we do now but Lord look at it now
[24:45] no wonder that's the damnation of the
[24:47] country when Satan got in the Pulpit
[24:48] it's the truth failing to preach the
[24:52] unadulterated word of God Amen
[24:55] they failed to preach it and the word of
[24:58] God will produce just exactly what it
[25:01] said it would do but we explain it all
[25:03] away
[25:04] it's for some other day
[25:07] now here's one about the Masterpiece
[25:08] when Satan got a hold of it the deceiver
[25:10] he broke through the walls he marred the
[25:12] Masterpiece I'm going to paraphrase and
[25:15] he took what he took the family and he
[25:17] pulled the family apart the family was
[25:19] once fortified by the word of God or
[25:21] fortified by this word
[25:24] but it broke apart by Eve and what she
[25:26] did
[25:27] Adam went with her but listen the great
[25:29] sculptor thanked God
[25:31] when I read this
[25:33] I see grace
[25:35] I see so much grace and mercy
[25:37] God didn't have to do that
[25:39] he could have just let it fall
[25:41] but he didn't he had a purpose because
[25:43] he see he was going to use that
[25:45] he was going to use that Masterpiece he
[25:47] went to work immediately to build it up
[25:49] again
[25:50] and he wasn't willing that it should
[25:52] perish lay there like that all the time
[25:54] because he's God and he will not be
[25:56] defeated
[25:57] so he went to work immediately to build
[25:59] it again in unto his own image a man
[26:04] we know that was Jesus Christ but then
[26:06] where is it now it's in the body of
[26:07] Believers I believe we are the
[26:09] Masterpiece of the end time
[26:12] as the evil one deceived the first two
[26:14] Brides who Eve and Israel he will try to
[26:18] deceive the Bride of this last day by
[26:20] trying to get her to hybridize herself
[26:22] through Creeds are just plainly turned
[26:25] from the word to any sign that suits her
[26:29] wow
[26:30] but God never placed signs ahead of the
[26:33] word signs follow the word is when
[26:34] Elijah told the woman to bake a cake for
[26:36] him first according to the word of the
[26:39] Lord when she did that the proper sign
[26:41] came come to the word first and then
[26:44] watch the miracle the seed word is
[26:46] energized
[26:48] by the spirit How can any messenger
[26:50] these people want to tear the message
[26:51] down messenger first actually How can
[26:54] any messenger sent from God believe only
[26:56] a part of the word and deny some of it
[26:58] the true prophet of God in this last day
[27:00] will proclaim the whole word now he's
[27:02] making a pretty bold statement
[27:05] denominations will hate him his words
[27:07] may be as harsh as John the Baptist who
[27:09] called them bipers but the predestinated
[27:11] will hear remember what they'll hear the
[27:14] voice not a voice they'll hear the voice
[27:17] of God to turn away from that come out
[27:20] of her my people but the predestinator
[27:23] will hear him be ready for the Rapture
[27:25] that means they went through
[27:26] justification sanctification baptism in
[27:28] the Holy Ghost and come to adoption
[27:31] and come to the headstone we'll get into
[27:34] that and I know those words sometimes we
[27:36] throw them out there we don't explain
[27:37] them but we will be able to do that if
[27:40] the Lord tarries the Royal Seed of
[27:42] Abraham
[27:44] with light Faith as Abrahams will hold
[27:46] to the word what he held there for 25
[27:49] years
[27:52] we can't hold on five minutes
[27:55] especially with our eyes closed
[27:58] for they are predestinated
[28:00] together
[28:02] 1963 this is the first sea on a watch
[28:05] and and I want you to see the the
[28:07] significance in this because he keeps
[28:09] saying church he keeps saying Church
[28:11] keeps saying church church I'll read it
[28:13] down through here you know you see I
[28:14] read it this morning it says Church
[28:16] but then he kind of pauses
[28:19] he said oh that just makes me tremble
[28:22] he says not Christ but the church
[28:25] it'll be revealed to the church listen
[28:27] Christ don't need to be revealed to
[28:29] himself
[28:30] he knows who he is
[28:32] we just don't know who he is and we
[28:35] don't know who we are now we do
[28:38] he says now
[28:40] but to the church notice oh my that just
[28:43] makes me tremble I hope that the church
[28:45] truly understands it see what I mean you
[28:48] people he got to pause this
[28:50] he said I'm going to call you bride
[28:53] see that you'll understand it in other
[28:55] words he said I'm talking to you I'm not
[28:57] talking to them out there
[29:00] amen Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[29:02] said then we stand justified in the
[29:04] presence of God that's a drop of ink
[29:06] dropping into a tub full of bleach
[29:07] you'll never find the stain event no
[29:09] more that's where you get the
[29:11] righteousness our robes are white
[29:14] by the blood bleach of the Lord
[29:16] it went somewhere but it'll never come
[29:19] back again
[29:20] and when man is truly redeemed that
[29:23] predestinated seed that sees it and
[29:25] accepts it now look there's two there's
[29:28] two
[29:29] you got to see it and accept it
[29:32] sees it and accepts it his sins are
[29:35] demolished it's gone it's separated it's
[29:38] dropped into the ink of the blood of
[29:39] Jesus Christ and it's never to be
[29:41] remembered God forgets it and he stands
[29:44] you he stands that son and daughter of
[29:46] God in the presence of God talking about
[29:48] us amen and amen
[29:49] no we will be we are redeemed we have
[29:52] Satan's answer
[29:54] God has Vindicated who himself through
[29:56] what his bride
[29:59] God proves himself where his bride
[30:03] to his promise in this day Hallelujah
[30:05] the headship is here
[30:07] Christ the Risen Lord is here in the
[30:09] same power of his resurrection that he
[30:11] ever was oh no bro Wade brother Brandon
[30:13] took that with him well
[30:15] in the words of somebody that lived
[30:17] around brother random hogwasher
[30:21] that's just a lie of the devil
[30:24] but that the answer we have to the devil
[30:26] is I want you to really believe this
[30:28] never since the Lord Jesus walked on
[30:30] this Earth has Satan had any kind of a
[30:33] of an opponent yeah yeah he's had some
[30:36] opponents here and he's had a few here
[30:37] but nothing like you and I
[30:41] if we're to defeat him he's never been
[30:44] defeated before now sure he was defeated
[30:46] before the foundation of the world but
[30:48] remember these people dead laying in the
[30:49] grave waiting on you and I to come out
[30:51] waiting on you and I to get them out all
[30:54] right so the formidable opponent is you
[30:58] and I because remember what Jesus did
[31:00] and I sure Jesus died he had to die yes
[31:03] he had to die to release his life so
[31:06] that he can come back and me and you but
[31:08] he did that so we don't have to die
[31:11] he destroyed deaths right death Hell In
[31:14] The Grave has no part with us we just
[31:17] got to believe that
[31:18] and walk into it so we have Satan's
[31:21] answer we have the people we have the
[31:23] players on the field all of them Pros
[31:31] won't have no Waterboys anymore
[31:35] and we we know we've read this many
[31:38] times but there's been churches churches
[31:42] Brides
[31:43] Brides churches Brides brides he's
[31:47] making a point
[31:48] but there's got to come
[31:50] in other words that
[31:54] is that Luther Wesley all the way up
[31:56] that was a bride that was predestinated
[31:58] to be in that time and was the bride
[32:01] they had the Holy Ghost in their soul
[32:03] but as brother Ram said in one other
[32:05] quote he said they couldn't get all the
[32:06] way out of the denomination listen
[32:08] Luther come out but he didn't come all
[32:10] the way out
[32:11] he was a reformer he was trying to
[32:14] reform the Catholic Church
[32:17] but I'm going to read you here in just a
[32:19] few minutes that God said I hate that
[32:22] system
[32:23] you say God hates Bible said he did
[32:27] he said he did in the Book of Revelation
[32:29] he said he hated it
[32:31] he hated the doctrine of the Nicolaitans
[32:34] he hates false Doctrine
[32:36] listen God can't stand false Doctrine
[32:39] but there's got to come one Hallelujah
[32:41] there has to come a real bride not to
[32:44] not that the other Brides were not real
[32:50] just like the Bible says to faithful and
[32:51] true witness not that he was false at
[32:53] one time because you're talking about
[32:54] Jesus Christ but the trueness of the day
[32:57] he needs to be in
[32:59] you and I can live in Pentecost we can
[33:01] live in Luther we live in Wesley but you
[33:04] will not mature as the Bride of Jesus
[33:06] Christ for the end time you've got to
[33:08] move up into this age
[33:10] to this time to this word to this
[33:13] updated Revelation not just coming from
[33:16] this church but this whole bride is
[33:19] moving yes
[33:20] if you're not moving you're behind
[33:24] backslid
[33:25] we got to keep moving even if it's one
[33:28] inch
[33:29] one step
[33:32] there must come one that's not only got
[33:34] the mechanics but the Dynamics
[33:36] makes that church live move and the
[33:40] power of his resurrection until we come
[33:42] to that place until we find that place
[33:45] what good does it do to polish the hubs
[33:47] what good does it do to give her a
[33:49] facelift or a simonized job when there's
[33:51] no Dynamics into it no matter how much
[33:53] the mechanics proves to be right there's
[33:56] got to be Dynamics to make it work all
[33:58] right that's what I want us to see that
[34:01] we we've got both
[34:05] but do we have the car over here in the
[34:08] can over here
[34:13] I mean that's gas I hope not it's water
[34:16] but it's gas
[34:19] this is Carr
[34:22] if that stays over here and this stays
[34:24] over here
[34:26] we're not going anywhere
[34:28] someone has to take the gas
[34:32] pour it in the car
[34:35] and who's left
[34:36] the bride
[34:38] denominations can't do it remember
[34:40] brother Brown said hey you all got
[34:42] plenty of money and no checks
[34:45] some of you Pentecostals has got plenty
[34:47] a big old checkbook and they got a dime
[34:49] in the bank
[34:50] he said if y'all ever get it together
[34:53] take the one that's got the chat take
[34:55] the one that's got the money put them
[34:56] together start writing checks
[34:59] same way with you and I
[35:02] to the bank of Heaven
[35:04] and I heard it was the voice of
[35:06] multitude voice of many Waters voice and
[35:07] mighty Thunder he's boys boys
[35:10] for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let
[35:12] us be glad to rejoice and give honor to
[35:13] him for the marriage of the Lamb has
[35:15] come and his wife hath made herself
[35:17] ready now look the marriage of the Lamb
[35:19] has come comma and
[35:21] all right when you get married you when
[35:23] you get born again you get married to
[35:24] Jesus Christ right
[35:26] but you've got to make yourself ready
[35:28] that's the statue of perfect man
[35:31] amen that's the statue of perfect man
[35:34] we're talking about that's the getting
[35:35] ready part
[35:37] oh no bro wait I just got it and I'm
[35:39] ready I doubt that very seriously
[35:43] you gotta make yourself ready and it
[35:45] says Made herself
[35:50] and to her was granted that she should
[35:51] be a raid and find linen clean and white
[35:53] for the fine linen it's the
[35:55] righteousness
[35:56] of saints the comforter in 1961. we were
[35:59] talking about the drugstore and the
[36:01] diagnosis and all that this morning
[36:02] let's continue on
[36:05] now we have a sacred Trust
[36:07] you know what he's talking about
[36:11] you sisters
[36:13] that are not married that are virgins
[36:15] you have a sacred trust that no one
[36:17] brother Brown talks about it marriage
[36:19] and divorce I'm not going to hit it so
[36:20] deep but you do have you all have a
[36:23] sacred trust your body is sacred
[36:27] come on somebody please help these kids
[36:30] your body is sacred
[36:33] should be Untouchable until you get
[36:36] married
[36:37] because that sacred trust it's all
[36:39] through the Bible
[36:41] well listen aren't we supposed to be the
[36:43] Virgin bride of Jesus Christ
[36:46] not manhandle brother Brown said one is
[36:49] being manhandled denominational Doctrine
[36:51] false teaching that's being manhandled
[36:54] by Satan but we have a sacred trust you
[36:57] know what that trust is and we have an
[37:00] inheritance an inheritance that we
[37:02] inherit as believing children it's a
[37:04] sacred trust and that sacred trust in
[37:06] our sacred Heritage is the word of God
[37:09] that's been given to us the full word of
[37:12] God
[37:12] the word itself is the vitamin the word
[37:15] itself God's word that's where reason
[37:17] I'm so dogmatic
[37:19] we had a dogmatic preacher too brother
[37:22] Dale was dogmatic about the word of God
[37:24] and it being right and it being taught
[37:25] amen
[37:27] all right that's the reason I'm so
[37:29] dogmatic as I would call it on standing
[37:31] on this word no matter what anyone else
[37:33] says if it's not with the word then I
[37:36] don't believe it
[37:38] see if you want to believe it that's all
[37:40] right but to me it takes the word
[37:42] because heaven and earth will pass away
[37:43] but my word will never fail therefore it
[37:46] takes
[37:47] that word
[37:49] the token 1964. and we can when we can
[37:53] display the token of the Holy Spirit
[37:55] shows that we have been accepted in
[37:57] Christ
[37:58] and that is our token that all we have
[38:01] met look all we have need of is already
[38:04] purchased by him we are identified with
[38:07] our token the token must be ready the
[38:10] blood Covenant blood is not recognized
[38:12] without the token all right the word
[38:15] assured us of the promise the token is
[38:19] the sign that the promise has been made
[38:21] for us
[38:22] full obedience to the full word of God
[38:25] entitles us to that token
[38:28] our token is a token to get out of here
[38:32] our token's not just to live right do
[38:34] right and sure it is it's all included
[38:36] but our ticket is not to a
[38:40] destination that we stop at
[38:43] it's a destination that we continue on
[38:46] over into another dimension
[38:49] no other way is there
[38:52] that you could ever be entitled look
[38:56] you've cut yourself off
[38:58] you can never be entitled to the token
[39:01] what the price that's been paid until
[39:04] you fully obey the word not what
[39:07] somebody's put into it and add it to it
[39:10] but what God said about it when he said
[39:12] you must be born again that don't mean
[39:14] jump up and down to the altar that don't
[39:15] mean walk back shake hands with a pastor
[39:17] that don't mean all this foolishness
[39:19] that we've seen done I bet that hurt a
[39:21] lot of people's feelings
[39:22] it don't mean putting your name on a
[39:24] church book it means Death to Your First
[39:26] being and Life to your second being
[39:28] that's pretty plain it means that the
[39:31] blood has been applied and you're
[39:33] identified by the life
[39:35] of Jesus Christ like I said before
[39:37] you've moved over into another family
[39:39] you start acting like your real daddy
[39:41] all right
[39:43] and if he'd be divine we be the branches
[39:46] the life that's in the branch is also
[39:48] from the mind it will bear
[39:51] the fruit this is kind of where we stop
[39:54] this morning have you received the Holy
[39:55] Ghost since you believe I keep saying
[39:57] that because there listen there's a
[39:59] group of people that were sincere
[40:02] they had a pastor
[40:04] wherever that was Apollos
[40:10] Paul Pops in on a service
[40:14] he hears this great sermon
[40:18] but there's something missing
[40:22] there's something missing
[40:25] because the prophet Paul or the Apostle
[40:27] Paul is sitting in that congregation he
[40:30] passed through the upper coast of
[40:31] Ephesus finding certain disciples so if
[40:33] you found him he didn't just say hey God
[40:35] bless you I'll see you later now he
[40:37] fellowship with him went church with him
[40:38] listened to a sermon
[40:41] and he said after the sermon was over he
[40:43] said if you receive the Holy Ghost since
[40:44] you believe y'all doing really good he
[40:47] didn't condemn them so much he said
[40:49] you're doing good but if you receive the
[40:51] Holy Ghost since you believe what you're
[40:53] preaching
[40:54] our teaching our living and they said
[40:58] I hadn't heard that message before
[41:01] ain't no way he said we have not even
[41:04] heard whether to be a Holy Ghost
[41:08] that's kind of it's kind of strange for
[41:10] us to see but but you go and say that we
[41:13] did go somewhere else and you sat down
[41:15] and you walked into this message or
[41:17] church and you listened to what they
[41:18] said and you said if you received the
[41:20] Holy Ghost since you believe you you're
[41:21] you're a nice bunch of believers
[41:24] but if you receive the Holy Ghost there
[41:26] must have been had to be something Paul
[41:28] discerned that was missing
[41:30] because they said
[41:33] they said we have not so much as heard
[41:36] about this teaching of the Holy Ghost In
[41:38] other words we hadn't heard a sermon
[41:40] preached Paul said
[41:43] you got a few minutes
[41:46] you got a few minutes I'll tell you
[41:48] about this God that I serve I'll tell
[41:50] you about this holy ghost that you need
[41:51] and remember the Bible continues on with
[41:54] Paul laid hands on when they received
[41:55] the Holy Ghost well but then they became
[41:57] a powerful Church
[41:59] remember that was a church of Ephesus
[42:02] there's only about 12 people but brother
[42:03] Brown said it was a very mature Church
[42:05] a powerful Church
[42:08] Ephesians 4 says let no corrupt
[42:10] communication
[42:11] proceed out of your mouth but that which
[42:12] is good the use of edifying now
[42:14] that may be ministered that Minister
[42:16] Grace into the hearers and grieve not
[42:18] the holy spirit of God is thinking today
[42:19] in between services
[42:21] we have all this list of things that we
[42:24] would think of and we know that we can
[42:26] greet the holy spirit of God by the way
[42:27] we act by the way we maybe say something
[42:30] to somebody or
[42:33] my false Doctrine
[42:36] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[42:40] of your mouth
[42:41] you say oh no brother that's cussing you
[42:44] should have got rid of that a long time
[42:45] ago
[42:46] you should got rid of that bad
[42:48] conversation a long time ago so what's
[42:51] Paul talking about corrupt communication
[42:53] false Doctrine false teaching your own
[42:56] ideas God will absolutely be grieved
[43:00] listen he can't be happy with false
[43:02] Doctrine
[43:05] so if he's not happy with false Doctrine
[43:07] he's grieved
[43:09] he does not like it I'm gonna read it to
[43:11] you right here in just a second
[43:13] bitterness wrath anger clamor evil
[43:15] speaking there we go again speaking
[43:18] but you count one to another
[43:19] tenderhearted
[43:22] as God for Christ's sake and forgive one
[43:24] another as for Christ's sake has
[43:26] forgiven you
[43:27] possessing against the enemy brother
[43:29] round said now be real Reverend
[43:30] everybody is coming to a prayer line he
[43:33] said keep quiet see the holy spirit is
[43:35] so timid how many knows that just real
[43:37] timid Holy Spirit just any little
[43:39] Interruption bothers him Revelations 2
[43:42] verse 15 says so hast thou also them
[43:45] that hold the doctrine
[43:47] where's that coming out of
[43:49] evil speaking
[43:52] that whole the doctrine of the
[43:53] Nicolaitans which thing I
[43:57] hate
[44:00] it
[44:03] he said that's your problem
[44:05] and in one place he said if you don't
[44:07] get away from that I'm gonna pull your
[44:08] Candlestick out
[44:11] oh he's such a good God yeah he's good
[44:14] you know why he's good he does what he
[44:16] says
[44:18] and he can't do anything but what is
[44:19] that but what he can't do anything but
[44:21] what his word has already said all right
[44:23] repent or else I will come unto thee
[44:26] quickly and will fight against them
[44:29] with the sword word
[44:32] of my mouth
[44:34] how do you cure false Doctrine with
[44:37] truth
[44:39] and listen false Doctrine can't hang
[44:42] around truth we know that
[44:44] that's some of these ministers
[44:48] they get more mad at you
[44:54] people anyway Matthew 7 verse 21 many
[44:58] will say to me Lord Lord
[45:00] have I not prophesied in thy name
[45:03] cast out Devils now look what is this
[45:05] though
[45:06] what is this scenario I didn't cover it
[45:09] the other day it's all works
[45:15] it's all works
[45:16] didn't brother Brown say word first
[45:19] word word first then the works
[45:22] the the lesson the anointed ones at the
[45:25] end time is just that's what they are
[45:27] that works first working up stuff and
[45:30] listen I don't mean stuff the working
[45:33] out though but see the Holy Ghost has to
[45:35] honor his word though
[45:38] because it says right here many will say
[45:40] to me in that day Lord Lord have I not
[45:42] prophesied in thy name cast out Devils
[45:45] the devil can't cast out the devil so it
[45:47] has to be the Holy Spirit they're doing
[45:48] the work and in thy name done many
[45:51] wonderful works
[45:52] sounds like a pretty good group of
[45:54] people
[45:55] then I will possess possess it
[45:58] profess unto them
[46:00] I don't even know you
[46:04] I might have heard of you
[46:06] but you're not one of mine
[46:09] you Pro You Preach false Doctrine you
[46:12] approach the word different
[46:14] says depart from you
[46:16] you that work iniquity
[46:20] see notice the anointed ones only the
[46:22] word will separate them not the signs oh
[46:24] no they'll do the same signs but the
[46:27] words what separates them
[46:30] listen can we stand along can we stand
[46:33] long enough to hear the word
[46:35] or do we want the signs and then run off
[46:38] we've had a lot of people
[46:40] picked a sign up and just run off with
[46:42] it
[46:43] word first
[46:45] word first
[46:48] and
[46:51] um bless Julie Hart she she tried to
[46:54] soften me up a little bit today
[46:57] she said you know you want us to say
[47:00] Amen she said I'm just thinking about
[47:02] what you're saying
[47:17] and she didn't say then I said amen
[47:19] after that either you didn't say that
[47:21] Julie you she walked off went to the
[47:23] bathroom so I couldn't ask her
[47:27] no she's
[47:28] she's a
[47:30] known Julie since
[47:33] she was a kid
[47:34] and she's always been a good she's
[47:36] always been a people pleaser so I thank
[47:38] you so very much
[47:40] but um
[47:41] but I want you to think about I want you
[47:44] to chew on it but don't get choked on it
[47:46] so you can say Amen
[47:50] let's try that one time amen
[47:53] one more time
[47:55] I just want to see Julie's lips move
[48:01] but thank you I appreciate that and
[48:04] yeah and and I apologize if I was a
[48:06] little quick this morning but
[48:08] you know Dad's taught in this church for
[48:11] years and years and years and and man
[48:13] when he lays it out you gotta chew it
[48:16] you got you it so you can't say Amen
[48:20] with your mouth full
[48:21] all right and he throw a mouthful out
[48:24] there I guess I'm just trying to give
[48:25] you a little tidbits and then want you
[48:27] to get a little happy about it in
[48:28] between so
[48:30] just something you got to deal with
[48:32] all right
[48:34] they all prophesied they all done this
[48:36] that and the other let's move on just
[48:38] the same Jesus said they would do it so
[48:40] listen it's going to be here
[48:43] they are going to put signs first
[48:47] I say they I mean people that are not
[48:51] taught well or people that don't have
[48:52] the Holy Ghost they're going to take the
[48:54] anointing every time
[48:57] because you and I listen that's why and
[48:59] I don't want to sound dogmatic but you
[49:02] know brother Branham he was real harsh
[49:04] on women about not being preachers and
[49:07] but I mean the Bible he was just saying
[49:09] what the Bible said because you sisters
[49:11] you take the emotional every time
[49:15] yeah you do y'all can chew on that if
[49:18] you want to but you live that way so you
[49:19] can just go ahead and say man then your
[49:21] man can just be quiet for a minute
[49:23] we can say Amen inside
[49:25] but aren't ain't that true so you take
[49:27] the emotional side eve took the
[49:29] emotional side because she didn't sure
[49:31] didn't take the word of God that says if
[49:33] you eat that you'll lie
[49:35] she took the emotion over what she was
[49:38] told over what the word said the word
[49:40] for their day right so that's why I said
[49:43] it's not that we have anything against
[49:44] sisters they're beautiful wonderful Holy
[49:46] Ghost Phil sisters can help you if
[49:48] you'll listen to them
[49:50] but not to get behind the pulpit and try
[49:52] to lead a group of people not by emotion
[49:56] first
[49:57] okay so I just wanted to throw that in
[49:59] there we it's not that we just don't
[50:00] want women to to to teach us so
[50:04] women's teach us all the time we have
[50:06] women teachers here and we learn for
[50:08] like Julia I learned from that
[50:11] I learned it y'all just not gonna say
[50:13] Amen all the time
[50:16] because you're chewing on what I said
[50:19] uh-huh
[50:21] let's move on
[50:23] Revelation 16 15 says behold I come as a
[50:27] thief
[50:28] blessed is he that watches
[50:30] and keep us his garments now we were
[50:33] talking about garments being white but
[50:35] we are also talking about getting
[50:36] dressed
[50:38] so you've got to dress yourself
[50:42] okay keep his garments lest he walked
[50:45] naked and they see a shame it was a
[50:47] shame for people to walk naked and and
[50:51] ought to be now
[50:53] they don't care anymore
[50:56] but he's going to gather them into one
[50:59] place called Armageddon and listen as we
[51:02] were talking about the natural battle is
[51:04] going to happen over here
[51:07] to clean the Earth off
[51:09] it is happening to us according to the
[51:11] force seal when it opened for us it
[51:14] showed me that there was a battle of
[51:16] Armageddon right here before the Rapture
[51:19] you're going to have an Armageddon
[51:22] you're going to have a battle of Good
[51:25] and Evil
[51:27] a place of great Slaughter the scene of
[51:30] a terrible retribution upon the wicked
[51:33] praise God
[51:35] I mean you want to keep the wicked go
[51:37] right ahead I don't want to keep the
[51:38] wicked I want the wicked out
[51:40] so I want to have my Armageddon to where
[51:42] to clean the Earth off clean that sister
[51:44] Kathy says this Earth this earth right
[51:47] Kathy this Earth
[51:49] God's Gonna clean this Earth off listen
[51:51] he's not going to destroy the Earth
[51:54] see there's another teaching of
[51:55] denominations that this this world is
[51:57] just going to get
[51:59] and we're going to live up yonder
[52:01] somewhere
[52:02] on a puffy cloud
[52:04] that wouldn't be good
[52:06] I'd need a big one broccoli need a big
[52:08] old Cloud too
[52:10] but we're going to live on this Earth
[52:12] thank God for a prophet and it's playing
[52:13] in the Bible
[52:15] that the Earth is just going to be burnt
[52:17] off just like you were burnt off
[52:19] just like your soul was burnt off at the
[52:21] new birth and now God's trying to work
[52:23] on your spirit realm to be burnt off and
[52:26] then he's going to really burn your
[52:28] flesh
[52:30] when you take a body change it's going
[52:32] to change you and what changes more than
[52:34] anything fire
[52:36] that's why you're going to get the Holy
[52:38] Ghost and Fire
[52:40] that's going to burn all that out what's
[52:42] the most cleansing thing in the world
[52:44] right fire
[52:47] kills germs and everything else
[52:50] now the battle started in heaven it'll
[52:52] finish on Earth it'll actually finish in
[52:55] Earth
[52:56] in the form of Armageddon watching see
[52:59] it unfold we're seeing it unfold now but
[53:02] as we said before in Daniel 12 verse 1
[53:04] there's a promise we know this is to
[53:06] Israel amen
[53:08] but since Israel is going to be over
[53:11] here on the other side of the bringing
[53:13] in the 144 thousand the bride's going to
[53:15] leave 144 000 is going to come in and
[53:18] then there's going to be a battle of
[53:19] Armageddon amen all right then it says
[53:22] at that time shall Michael stand up the
[53:25] great Prince which standeth for the
[53:27] children of thy people
[53:29] and he's going to fight
[53:32] listen
[53:34] let God fight your battle
[53:37] give it to Michael
[53:39] give the fight
[53:41] that he promised right here this is
[53:43] toward the end it's just at the battle
[53:45] of Armageddon if we're in that battle of
[53:47] Armageddon right now
[53:49] right now there's going to be as brother
[53:51] round said one time Armageddon means a
[53:53] termination of forces now today there's
[53:57] two forces this battling in this
[53:59] Sanctuary right now and inside of you
[54:02] Good and Evil it's battling there's
[54:05] going to be a head up of that battle and
[54:08] somebody's gonna win
[54:09] and we know who wins
[54:12] so if you got the winner inside of you
[54:16] you're going to win
[54:18] but Michael's going to stand up folks
[54:20] let me tell you something and promise
[54:22] you he's going to stand up for this
[54:23] bride first
[54:25] I know he's going to stand for Israel
[54:27] right here I can see it but he's
[54:29] standing up for me and you right now
[54:30] because Michael is who
[54:34] Michael is Christ
[54:36] where's Christ Paul says Colossians were
[54:39] exactly where that fighter is
[54:42] Christ in you the hope of glory
[54:47] there shall be time of trouble such as
[54:48] never was since there was a nation
[54:51] and at that time thy people shall be
[54:53] delivered
[54:54] everyone that shall be found written
[54:57] in the book
[54:59] listen
[55:01] real quick
[55:04] that was a battle in Luther's age
[55:07] there was a battle in Wesley's age
[55:09] there was a battle of forces
[55:12] everybody with me
[55:13] all right
[55:15] there were some physical battles
[55:17] like in the Dark Ages you could just say
[55:19] you were a Christian and they killed you
[55:21] sent you to the lines
[55:24] but those battles were not like the very
[55:27] last one
[55:31] because there was more battles
[55:32] afterwards
[55:35] okay Luther had a battle and then his
[55:37] battle was over he went into the other
[55:39] dimension and now
[55:41] um
[55:42] whatever your name is Ruth said that she
[55:44] had that battle now it was hers
[55:47] you were thinking you didn't say amen
[55:48] that's good see it all works together
[55:51] I'll try to understand y'all after a
[55:53] while
[55:55] but she said it's in me well that's
[55:56] where it comes it comes you just say hey
[55:58] it's in me
[55:59] the valve Armageddon the Battle of
[56:01] Antietam the battle that you know when
[56:03] they dropped the bomb and Hiroshima and
[56:05] Nagasaki just a few days later Japan
[56:07] said I had enough of this
[56:09] all right so what are we going to say
[56:12] we've had enough of this
[56:14] got better Tommy bomb of faith
[56:17] on the end of me and he's going to say
[56:21] I just can't even stand to touch y'all
[56:23] no more I just wished one day he could
[56:25] do that
[56:27] I wish I could say hey devil I'm gonna
[56:29] be over here
[56:31] but I'm gonna really be over there
[56:33] and he show up over there
[56:35] and hope a train hits him
[56:39] you like him
[56:41] okay just wanted to make sure neither do
[56:44] I
[56:44] he don't like you either
[56:46] you know why because if you ho if you
[56:48] know in your mind right now that you are
[56:51] Christ in you the hope of glory that you
[56:53] are the final battle of the Gentiles now
[56:56] you hear me as the Gentile battle this
[56:58] is the final battle he's gonna have to
[57:00] face in flesh in your flesh the other
[57:02] battle is going to be physical battle
[57:04] they're gonna be actually killing each
[57:06] other dropping atomic bombs and all that
[57:08] stuff
[57:09] but see but Satan has a he wants to be
[57:12] that spiritual person though
[57:14] but see he wants to take over you first
[57:16] if he can take over you he's got all the
[57:17] other battles that's the only battle
[57:19] he's looking at
[57:20] but he can't do it he's got a bride that
[57:22] he he wants to touch that soul but he
[57:25] can't touch it
[57:26] and now now look
[57:29] there was a time of trouble such as
[57:31] never was since there was a nation and
[57:34] I'm going to declare there never was a
[57:36] time of trouble or a battle since the
[57:40] church ages began
[57:43] I want you to think you don't have to
[57:45] say Amen
[57:48] Hey listen if this is the final one
[57:50] we're standing in the final battle
[57:53] there were many other little battles
[57:56] but they never culminated into that
[57:59] D-Day or whatever you wanted that that
[58:01] dropping the bombs you know it if we if
[58:04] we look at the the natural part of it uh
[58:06] you know Roosevelt died
[58:09] and the war wasn't over
[58:12] so Harry Truman took over and he sat
[58:14] down with his with his um advisors
[58:19] his generals and he said okay how long
[58:22] is this thing going to last if we just
[58:24] fight
[58:25] we just fight like we are we're on two
[58:28] fronts now we're on Japan
[58:30] and this is life lesson
[58:33] there's one in Germany there's two
[58:35] fronts now one in Germany and one in
[58:37] Japan
[58:38] if Japanese don't like us they still
[58:40] don't they didn't like us back then
[58:42] but we kind of got this one under
[58:44] control
[58:45] Hitler commits suicide we go in and take
[58:48] over Germany Berlin and all that but you
[58:50] still got the Japanese
[58:52] he said all right he said how long will
[58:54] the war last and how many lives he said
[58:57] they said well we don't know it could be
[58:58] two to four more years
[59:00] to get them under control
[59:02] and it's going to be you know a hundred
[59:04] thousand more lives
[59:07] they said or we can drop this bomb
[59:11] and it'll be about a week
[59:13] if they don't submit we'll drop another
[59:15] one
[59:16] they said it'll be about two weeks it
[59:18] cost them about 250 000 lives and us
[59:21] none
[59:22] well
[59:24] Harry Truman said what drop the bomb
[59:28] what are you saying see that was a
[59:30] control you look at you look at the
[59:31] situation you got
[59:33] even in your life folks kids all of us
[59:36] you look and see how long this is going
[59:38] to last how long sin is going to carry
[59:40] you and take you you better get over
[59:42] here where this atomic bombs at
[59:45] get over here whether it's atomic bombs
[59:47] that to take over quick because listen
[59:48] then another 20 years left I don't
[59:50] believe
[59:51] I just don't believe there's another 20
[59:53] years of this world left so let's get
[59:57] this war over with let's get this battle
[59:59] that we have been given we have been
[1:00:02] given every weapon we need
[1:00:04] to fight this battle so let's end it
[1:00:08] let's end it together
[1:00:10] let's end it with no lives lost on this
[1:00:12] side
[1:00:13] hey man is that all right is that okay
[1:00:15] we do that
[1:00:17] so brother Rams tells we've had many
[1:00:19] great battles spiritual battles he says
[1:00:21] then he talks about v-day Victory day
[1:00:23] it'll finally wind up in the battle of
[1:00:25] Armageddon that'll be the last of it
[1:00:27] when she comes to the battle Armageddon
[1:00:29] that'll sell the whole thing don't you
[1:00:30] want to come to a place where the whole
[1:00:32] thing gets settled
[1:00:33] oh
[1:00:36] some of you are not even have to think
[1:00:38] about that
[1:00:40] I want it done and over with
[1:00:42] amen
[1:00:44] now we know that we talk about the egg
[1:00:46] caterpillar people let's don't do that
[1:00:49] y'all know what metamorphosis is I was
[1:00:51] reading something yesterday about
[1:00:53] uh butterflies and it really Thrills you
[1:00:55] you know because like I said before if
[1:00:58] if you start with the the adult
[1:01:01] butterfly
[1:01:02] that lays an egg that looks nothing like
[1:01:04] the adult
[1:01:06] but inside of it it is
[1:01:09] it goes to the next stage still ugly old
[1:01:12] caterpillar
[1:01:14] still the butterflies inside there
[1:01:16] what's happened is though is the is the
[1:01:18] DNA of that butterfly
[1:01:21] is separated
[1:01:23] it's inside that worm and as that worm
[1:01:26] eats those cells start breaking and when
[1:01:28] they start breaking they come together
[1:01:30] they make a wing and another wing and a
[1:01:33] body and legs all inside of that
[1:01:36] caterpillar and you really don't see it
[1:01:38] until the very end
[1:01:42] then what happens is what is born
[1:01:48] the parent
[1:01:49] is born all over again
[1:01:53] justification sanctification and baptism
[1:01:55] of the Holy Ghost and adoption
[1:02:00] it's when your name is as good on a
[1:02:02] checkbook
[1:02:04] as the fathers during this time and then
[1:02:07] when you come to the very end stage you
[1:02:09] write the check
[1:02:13] you just hand it to whoever you need to
[1:02:15] hand it to listen to this adoption just
[1:02:16] for a few minutes and we'll close
[1:02:18] now what is adoption and we're going to
[1:02:20] talk about this just for a second
[1:02:21] because that adoption is the statue of a
[1:02:25] perfect man everybody with me all right
[1:02:28] but look it says your adoption is not
[1:02:31] your birth so brother Branham thank God
[1:02:33] for a prophet that separated it your
[1:02:35] adoption's not your birth your you can
[1:02:37] be born again and not be adopted
[1:02:40] but you can't come to adoption full
[1:02:42] Authority without being born again all
[1:02:44] right so that's why the new birth is
[1:02:46] very important all right
[1:02:48] your adoption is not your birth your
[1:02:51] adoption is your placing and like I said
[1:02:52] before
[1:02:54] the master builder when when your body
[1:02:57] is forming in a womb remember it comes
[1:02:59] from just a couple of cells right sperm
[1:03:01] and egg then all of a sudden they come
[1:03:04] together then all of a sudden the spine
[1:03:05] comes then all of a sudden an arm comes
[1:03:07] and it was all in there to begin with
[1:03:10] but it had to come through stages
[1:03:13] man
[1:03:15] those cells had to be placed
[1:03:18] you think how wonderful God is
[1:03:21] you know when I'm when I was being
[1:03:23] formed in the womb
[1:03:25] a long time ago
[1:03:27] that it made sure that I had a torso
[1:03:32] that had many cells wrapped around it
[1:03:34] but when it come out to the end of my
[1:03:36] hand now why didn't why didn't these
[1:03:39] cells attach to them and that be
[1:03:40] together
[1:03:42] why won't your mouth just one unit some
[1:03:45] of you maybe you wish that would be good
[1:03:48] thank you brother Louise he said yes
[1:03:51] but why did I do that because your sales
[1:03:53] knew where to migrate
[1:03:55] by God
[1:03:57] by his design
[1:03:59] that cell wouldn't attach to that finger
[1:04:01] it wrapped around and made my finger
[1:04:05] same way with us
[1:04:07] same thing with us in the body of Christ
[1:04:09] you have a place that cell had a place
[1:04:11] to go
[1:04:14] when you're born again look when you're
[1:04:16] born again the spirit of God we are sons
[1:04:17] of God what in other words you're a body
[1:04:19] you're you're being formed all right in
[1:04:22] the image of God but we were
[1:04:24] predestinated now here's what I'm trying
[1:04:27] to get to you for the sons of the last
[1:04:29] day now look last day not Luther not
[1:04:31] Wesley
[1:04:32] last day we were predestinated in other
[1:04:37] words let me not let me interplay we
[1:04:39] were predestinated to be placed
[1:04:44] to know where we were
[1:04:47] to know what our job is
[1:04:49] and stay in that job
[1:04:52] we were predestinated unto our placing
[1:04:59] for as many years were led by the spirit
[1:05:00] of God they are the sons of God all
[1:05:03] right you're born again you're a son and
[1:05:04] daughter of God
[1:05:06] for you have not received the spirit of
[1:05:08] bondage again to fear but you have
[1:05:09] received the spirit of adoption
[1:05:12] whereby we cry daddy daddy cry because
[1:05:16] you're a baby
[1:05:18] the spirit itself bearing witnessed with
[1:05:20] our spirit now look
[1:05:22] that we are the children of God in other
[1:05:25] words why we start acting like our
[1:05:26] parents
[1:05:27] and if children than heirs Heirs of God
[1:05:29] and join heirs with Christ look if so be
[1:05:32] that we
[1:05:33] have a Garden of Eden
[1:05:36] have no problems at all
[1:05:38] oh no it says if so be that we suffer
[1:05:41] with him that we may be also glorified
[1:05:44] together Ephesians 1 verse 4 according
[1:05:46] as he has chosen us where in him when
[1:05:50] before the foundation of the world
[1:05:52] God's going to have a bride God's going
[1:05:55] to have an adopted bride God's going to
[1:05:57] have an end time bride that lets God
[1:05:59] have so much of their life till they're
[1:06:02] going to change their whole body is
[1:06:03] going to change
[1:06:05] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:06:08] before him in love having predestinated
[1:06:11] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:06:14] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[1:06:17] good pleasure of his will
[1:06:20] now Matthew 17 verse 5. now Jesus when
[1:06:23] he was born as a baby we read it several
[1:06:25] weeks ago you know there was a spirit
[1:06:28] like a Dove came down and and lit on
[1:06:31] Jesus and there was a voice that said
[1:06:33] this is my beloved Son
[1:06:35] in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[1:06:39] at your new birth that's exactly what
[1:06:41] God says to you
[1:06:43] he turns to the angels and he says hey
[1:06:45] I'm pleased to dwell in that guy right
[1:06:47] there
[1:06:51] y'all watch after him
[1:06:53] he's special
[1:06:54] he's mine
[1:06:58] while he gets paid Behold a bright Cloud
[1:07:00] overshadowed them now this is Matthew
[1:07:01] 17. I just told you what happened in
[1:07:03] first of Matthew
[1:07:05] now Jesus is almost walked for three and
[1:07:08] a half years almost he's getting toward
[1:07:10] the end of his life
[1:07:12] and they went up on a mountain
[1:07:14] and a bright Cloud overshadowed them and
[1:07:16] behold a voice
[1:07:18] out of the cloud which said this is my
[1:07:20] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[1:07:23] hear ye him so in other words I'm going
[1:07:26] to revert everything that you need to
[1:07:28] hear I want you to hear you're going to
[1:07:30] hear it from this guy right here
[1:07:32] that's why that that we see that I see
[1:07:35] that brother Brown when he went to the
[1:07:37] out in Arizona and the cloud came down
[1:07:39] if we would have been standing there I
[1:07:41] believe we could have heard the same
[1:07:42] thing
[1:07:44] hear ye him
[1:07:46] you got to hear this man this is my
[1:07:47] prophet and if you want to be literally
[1:07:49] that's fine with you but
[1:07:54] not toward the eating
[1:07:57] no
[1:07:58] give me this
[1:07:59] this is good
[1:08:00] I'll take this
[1:08:03] Luke 9 verse 33 says it came to pass as
[1:08:05] they departed from him Peter said unto
[1:08:07] Jesus Master now this is another view
[1:08:09] it is good for us to be here and let us
[1:08:12] make three Tabernacles one for thee one
[1:08:14] from Moses one for Elias not knowing
[1:08:16] what he said
[1:08:19] all right now watch while he just spayed
[1:08:22] that came a cloud and overshadowed them
[1:08:25] and they feared as they entered into the
[1:08:28] cloud
[1:08:30] now Matthew didn't say anything about
[1:08:31] them entering into a cloud it just said
[1:08:33] a cloud came down
[1:08:34] but they feared as they entered into the
[1:08:36] cloud
[1:08:37] and there came a voice out of the cloud
[1:08:40] saying this is my beloved Son
[1:08:43] hear him
[1:08:46] and when the voice was passed
[1:08:50] Jesus was found alone
[1:08:54] and they kept it close
[1:08:56] and told no man in those days any of
[1:08:59] those things we stayed sane
[1:09:03] and I wrote myself a note remember
[1:09:05] brother random sat on the sixth sale on
[1:09:06] questions and answered the seals he said
[1:09:08] it's not for you
[1:09:11] there's no way you're even going to
[1:09:12] explain what's going on so Peter James
[1:09:14] and John they made they made one mention
[1:09:17] of something being on the mountain Peter
[1:09:18] did but there was no mention of this
[1:09:20] anywhere else
[1:09:23] none we wouldn't know we would have
[1:09:25] known none of this without Matthew
[1:09:27] being there and God's showing Luke this
[1:09:30] part of it so it wasn't for them
[1:09:34] the adoption part of Jesus was not for
[1:09:36] them
[1:09:37] come on
[1:09:40] because remember did they hear him
[1:09:43] even the 12 that was up there didn't
[1:09:45] know what he was saying
[1:09:47] so it wasn't for them they kept it in
[1:09:49] their heart and they pondered it around
[1:09:51] and maybe by the time they got born
[1:09:52] again they might have figured out Peter
[1:09:54] did later on he said having a more sure
[1:09:57] word of Prophecy I was on that mountain
[1:09:59] but I got a more sure word now because I
[1:10:01] got him in my heart
[1:10:03] he's not standing there looking at me
[1:10:04] he's in my heart
[1:10:07] Ephesians 4 11 says he gave he gave some
[1:10:10] Apostles and some prophets and some
[1:10:11] evangelists and some pastors and
[1:10:13] teachers why for the perfecting of the
[1:10:17] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:10:19] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[1:10:22] we all come to the unity of the faith
[1:10:25] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[1:10:27] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[1:10:31] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:10:32] which is behind me here that we
[1:10:35] henceforth be no more children now
[1:10:36] listen the Bible compels us not to stay
[1:10:39] kids do not say sure do not stay
[1:10:42] children it's okay to be a child it's
[1:10:44] okay to drink milk it's okay to want the
[1:10:47] things of of a child
[1:10:50] but you got to move out of that
[1:10:53] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:10:55] tossed to and fro now this is what's
[1:10:57] going to happen if you stay a child
[1:11:00] you're going to be tossed to and fro and
[1:11:02] carried about with every wind of
[1:11:03] Doctrine what we were talking about
[1:11:04] brother Louise for people that you see
[1:11:07] people they just like like a ping pong
[1:11:08] machine
[1:11:09] or a weight calling thing
[1:11:12] pinball machine
[1:11:17] and then somebody hits them real good
[1:11:20] with that flipper and they're gone
[1:11:25] you'll get what I'm saying in a minute
[1:11:28] toss to and fro and carried away with
[1:11:31] every wind of Doctrine look by the
[1:11:33] slight of men
[1:11:35] preachers
[1:11:37] sorry to say
[1:11:39] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[1:11:41] awake to the seed they are going to be
[1:11:43] there
[1:11:45] do not kid yourself
[1:11:49] today in our little town of Gillsville
[1:11:51] that was a thief lying in wait and he
[1:11:53] broke in the Dollar General
[1:11:55] they're everywhere
[1:12:00] they said all they stole was candy so
[1:12:03] look for a kid
[1:12:05] or an adult with suckers I don't know
[1:12:09] but but what am I saying they're going
[1:12:11] to be there they're going to be here
[1:12:13] someone told me a long time ago somebody
[1:12:17] got scammed well somebody actually in
[1:12:18] our in our little town got scammed a
[1:12:21] couple last week out of a hundred
[1:12:22] dollars and they wouldn't give her money
[1:12:25] back venmo or somebody it was
[1:12:27] but there's people on this Earth that
[1:12:30] literally get up like me and you we get
[1:12:32] up we set our alarm clock my alarm clock
[1:12:34] not tomorrow but Tuesday will go off at
[1:12:36] 6 30.
[1:12:38] I'll get up I'll read a little bit I'll
[1:12:40] study a little bit I'll
[1:12:43] drink some coffee and drink some more
[1:12:44] coffee and drink some more coffee and go
[1:12:47] get dressed and and go to work and I go
[1:12:50] to my cubicle and I put my mail in and
[1:12:52] that's my job right there are people in
[1:12:55] this world
[1:12:56] that get up to do the same thing but to
[1:12:58] deceive you out of your money
[1:13:01] they treat it just like a job because
[1:13:03] folks they good at it
[1:13:06] I ain't gonna ask how many people been
[1:13:08] scammed in this building but somebody
[1:13:10] probably has
[1:13:11] or even tried I know they've tried
[1:13:14] I just do like Josh I go huh you want to
[1:13:17] talk to my mama
[1:13:19] the best way to do it don't talk to my
[1:13:20] mama
[1:13:22] nothing against Jim but speaking the
[1:13:25] truth and love look
[1:13:28] the truth in love may grow up
[1:13:31] into him in all things which is the head
[1:13:34] even Christ the Bible talks about
[1:13:36] edifying the act of one who promotes
[1:13:39] another's growth in Christian wisdom
[1:13:40] party happiness and Holiness I hope that
[1:13:44] we in this church and we as Believers
[1:13:46] and as as we converse with each other
[1:13:48] that we we do promote
[1:13:51] another's growth in Christian wisdom
[1:13:53] piety happiness and Holiness all right
[1:13:56] one more before we close and then we'll
[1:13:58] take communion
[1:14:00] brother Brown tells us for in the Bible
[1:14:02] it said there was set Apostles Prophet
[1:14:04] evangelist teachers pastors all these
[1:14:06] for the Perfection of the church God set
[1:14:09] them in the church now there's nine
[1:14:11] spiritual gifts and they separates the
[1:14:12] two there's nine spiritual gifts what
[1:14:13] brother Bob was talking about this
[1:14:14] morning that we can lay on hands and so
[1:14:17] forth but remember that really is
[1:14:19] exclusive that is a power that's given
[1:14:22] but not everybody gets it
[1:14:26] everybody don't have the gift of
[1:14:27] Prophecy everybody know how the gift of
[1:14:29] Divine Healing and by with me all right
[1:14:32] it's severally given as the Bible says
[1:14:35] so God set them into church now there's
[1:14:38] nine spiritual gifts that will lay on
[1:14:39] hands so forth pray earnestly for the
[1:14:41] best gift so forth but these others see
[1:14:45] God predestinated this five-fold
[1:14:47] ministry to get a bride ready
[1:14:51] and you can say whatever you want to
[1:14:53] sitting at home ain't gonna do it
[1:14:59] God sets them
[1:15:01] in the church
[1:15:03] here you him 1958 brother Brown said
[1:15:05] he's he has said in the church gifts
[1:15:07] first apostles are missionaries Apostle
[1:15:10] Apostle means one cent missionary means
[1:15:12] one cent Apostle prophets teachers
[1:15:14] evangelists pastors they're all
[1:15:15] predestinated gifts of God gifts and
[1:15:18] callings are without repentance they're
[1:15:20] placed in the church to bring the church
[1:15:21] together hold it together for the glory
[1:15:25] of God
[1:15:26] hahaha
[1:15:28] let's read this right and then we'll
[1:15:30] close let's get ready take communion
[1:15:32] right after this second Peter 1 verse
[1:15:34] two now this is what we were reading way
[1:15:36] back a long time ago this is the uh what
[1:15:39] brother Brown reads for the Statue of a
[1:15:41] perfect man but let's read it in three
[1:15:42] parts we're not going to get to the
[1:15:44] Chart but we'll get to it later on Grace
[1:15:48] and peace be multiplied and this is
[1:15:49] Peter unto you through the knowledge of
[1:15:51] God and of Jesus our lord
[1:15:54] according has his divine power
[1:15:57] hath given unto us now
[1:16:00] Satan doesn't have a divine power
[1:16:03] right
[1:16:04] there's only one Divine amen
[1:16:06] and there's only one divine power
[1:16:09] and that's the Holy Ghost
[1:16:10] all right that's Jesus Christ all right
[1:16:14] so that just kind of narrows it down
[1:16:16] to one person right according as his
[1:16:19] divine power hath given unto us so
[1:16:21] whatever it is he giveth us
[1:16:22] all things that pertain unto life and
[1:16:25] godliness through the knowledge of him
[1:16:26] that hath called us to go in virtue
[1:16:28] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:16:30] grain precious promises now look it gave
[1:16:33] us the promises it didn't say we were
[1:16:34] going to automatically get them
[1:16:37] come on somebody
[1:16:40] they're there
[1:16:42] they're there to get yes but you gotta
[1:16:44] want them you got to get them make
[1:16:47] yourself ready
[1:16:49] whereby are giving unto us exceeding
[1:16:51] grain pressures promises that by these
[1:16:53] brother Brown said these promises you
[1:16:55] might be partakers of the divine nature
[1:16:58] now not your nature not your daddy's
[1:17:01] nature
[1:17:03] down here neighbors nature
[1:17:06] but divine nature that's got to be the
[1:17:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's got to
[1:17:12] be you've got to be born again
[1:17:14] before you begin any of this process of
[1:17:18] going up the statue of perfect man
[1:17:19] because look having escaped the
[1:17:22] corruption that is in this world through
[1:17:24] lust all right there's a break verse
[1:17:27] five and besides this in other words
[1:17:29] besides this new birth that we've been
[1:17:31] talking about
[1:17:33] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:17:36] virtue to Virtue knowledge knowledge
[1:17:38] Temperance Temperance patience patience
[1:17:40] godliness and to Godliness brotherly
[1:17:42] kindness and the brotherly kindness love
[1:17:45] or charity okay there's your there's
[1:17:48] your model
[1:17:51] all right we're gonna take another break
[1:17:52] verse 8 though says 4.
[1:17:56] if these things be in you
[1:18:00] and abound
[1:18:02] overflow
[1:18:07] that's what I was saying this morning I
[1:18:08] love what the Bible says they make you
[1:18:12] I like to read it like that they make
[1:18:14] you
[1:18:17] in other words you get these virtues you
[1:18:19] can't help
[1:18:21] but be a Powerhouse of God
[1:18:24] they make you that you shall neither be
[1:18:27] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:18:31] of our Lord Jesus Christ in other words
[1:18:33] you'll know more about God
[1:18:36] than that first part
[1:18:39] sorry you will but look but he that
[1:18:42] lacking lack at these things is blind
[1:18:44] now remember don't take the Christianity
[1:18:47] away don't take the new birth away you
[1:18:49] can't throw them out of the Kingdom
[1:18:52] once you get that DNA of God you're
[1:18:54] stuck
[1:18:57] but you can lack these things and be
[1:19:00] blind
[1:19:02] and cannot see it far off in other words
[1:19:04] your Revelation is not going to be much
[1:19:06] further than your nose
[1:19:08] at the end of your face
[1:19:10] and cannot see it far off and has
[1:19:12] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:19:15] old sins wherefore the rather Brethren
[1:19:17] give diligence Here We Go Again Peter
[1:19:19] was a diligent he was a fisherman
[1:19:22] he fished he fished he throwed a net out
[1:19:25] remember he told Jesus he said I throw
[1:19:27] this net out all night
[1:19:30] pretty diligent he said I've not caught
[1:19:33] one thing
[1:19:34] Jesus said how about throwing it on
[1:19:36] another side of the boat
[1:19:38] you remember what happened right they
[1:19:40] couldn't pull the fish in
[1:19:42] well they weren't all just laying over
[1:19:44] here because Peter was over here
[1:19:46] Jesus was making a point he created him
[1:19:49] fish
[1:19:53] wherefore the rather brother and give
[1:19:54] diligence to make your calling not your
[1:19:57] pastor not your brother not your sister
[1:19:59] not your neighbor your calling find out
[1:20:02] who you are and what you're doing here
[1:20:05] calling an election sure
[1:20:09] for if you do these things
[1:20:12] you shall never fall
[1:20:17] what a promise
[1:20:19] if you do these things this formula
[1:20:23] brother Brown said this prescription
[1:20:27] you shall never fall
[1:20:33] pursue an entrance shall be ministered
[1:20:36] unto you
[1:20:38] you know what God's Gonna pour out the
[1:20:40] windows of Heaven if you'll just make
[1:20:41] yourself available
[1:20:43] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[1:20:45] unto you abundantly look at all these
[1:20:47] adjectives that that this sorry this
[1:20:50] dumb fisherman that couldn't even sign
[1:20:52] his name
[1:20:53] where's he getting these big words
[1:20:55] brother Kylie
[1:20:58] he was a dumb fisherman that's what
[1:21:00] brother Brown said
[1:21:01] ignorant Bible said ignorant even the
[1:21:04] Bible called him ignorant
[1:21:06] ignorant none learned I can't say some
[1:21:08] of these words couldn't spell them
[1:21:10] anyway
[1:21:11] but the Holy Ghost is telling us through
[1:21:13] Peter what to do
[1:21:15] it's not just a dumb fisherman talking
[1:21:17] to us
[1:21:18] it's God Almighty in human flesh
[1:21:21] for showing entrance shall be ministered
[1:21:23] unto you abundantly
[1:21:25] and to the Everlasting Kingdom of our
[1:21:27] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[1:21:29] wherefore I will not be negligent this
[1:21:33] this church this ministry is not
[1:21:36] negligent amen
[1:21:46] that you could have saved so they could
[1:21:48] have said amen
[1:21:49] a little bit quicker
[1:21:51] I'm gonna say it one more time wherefore
[1:21:56] Legend
[1:22:01] reach it to you for 50 years
[1:22:03] 60 years I'm gonna preach you the same
[1:22:06] identical thing over and over again
[1:22:08] until you get it
[1:22:10] wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[1:22:13] you always in remembrance of these
[1:22:15] things
[1:22:16] though you know them
[1:22:19] and be established
[1:22:21] in the present day
[1:22:22] message of the hour less than our feet
[1:22:31] Ephesians 4 verse 14 says we that we
[1:22:33] henceforth be no more children
[1:22:35] Tosh to to and fro with every wind of
[1:22:38] Doctrine
[1:22:39] like we was talking about a ping pong
[1:22:41] Machine by the slot of men and cunning
[1:22:44] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[1:22:46] deceive but speaking the truth in love
[1:22:48] may grow up
[1:22:50] into him in all things which is the head
[1:22:54] even Christ
[1:22:57] who's doing the
[1:23:03] it's up here it's up here in the office
[1:23:07] anybody have a need before we take
[1:23:09] communion I know we we um sometimes we
[1:23:12] hurry into the communion but but we also
[1:23:15] that's why we do in the communion we
[1:23:17] always tarry just for a minute or so so
[1:23:19] you can clear your mind ask God to
[1:23:22] forgive you
[1:23:23] if you have a sickness
[1:23:25] you know we sometimes we don't read that
[1:23:27] part of the Bible the Bible tells us
[1:23:30] remember the Bible tells us that if we
[1:23:33] pray
[1:23:34] if we ask forgiveness
[1:23:37] if God forgives us
[1:23:42] we ask him for healing
[1:23:45] and he gives us forgiveness right and
[1:23:48] know what the Bible says
[1:23:50] so you come praying to be healed he said
[1:23:52] your sins will even be forgiven
[1:23:55] and you're not praying for that you're
[1:23:56] sick as a dog
[1:23:59] but somehow he clears your slate
[1:24:01] I'm just reading the Bible so that's
[1:24:03] what we need to do every once in a while
[1:24:05] when we get healed you just say oh thank
[1:24:07] God my Slate's clean
[1:24:12] you get a headache or something somebody
[1:24:14] pray for you and you get healed or or
[1:24:16] you have a something going on in your
[1:24:18] life and you have prayer and that thing
[1:24:20] goes away or brother John say not just
[1:24:23] thank God for my healing thank you God
[1:24:25] that all my sins have been forgiven
[1:24:30] amen what sins you talking about
[1:24:32] right
[1:24:34] anybody have a need before we take
[1:24:36] communion
[1:24:40] let me get over here to the communion
[1:24:42] scriptures give me a moment
[1:24:48] oh they got it up here so let's just
[1:24:50] let's just read it off the screen
[1:24:55] all right
[1:24:56] First Corinthians 11 verse 23
[1:24:59] uh if you'll go ahead and start it we'll
[1:25:02] read it
[1:25:04] we got uh
[1:25:08] thank you Adams back there running the
[1:25:10] show today Adam and Levi
[1:25:13] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:25:15] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:25:16] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:25:18] was betrayed took bread
[1:25:20] and when he had given thanks he'd break
[1:25:21] it and said take it this is my body
[1:25:23] which is broken for you this dude
[1:25:27] in remembrance
[1:25:28] of me remember the remember the lord
[1:25:31] it's not just something that you know
[1:25:34] Lisa made the bread and we made the wine
[1:25:36] and we're gonna this is something you
[1:25:38] know it's kind of a catch-up day no you
[1:25:40] think about the Lord what he did for you
[1:25:43] like I said before you want to get
[1:25:45] healed all right then you want to get
[1:25:47] your sins forgiven let's remember the
[1:25:49] Lord
[1:25:50] after the same manner he took the cup
[1:25:53] and when he had stopped saying this cup
[1:25:55] is the New Testament in my blood let's
[1:25:57] do you as often as you drinking in
[1:25:59] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:26:01] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:26:03] show the Lord's death
[1:26:05] till he comes
[1:26:09] wherefore
[1:26:10] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:26:12] this cup of the Lord unworthily Jesus is
[1:26:15] making a point
[1:26:16] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:26:18] the Lord now what is the body and blood
[1:26:20] of the lord it's the Saints it's the
[1:26:22] body
[1:26:23] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:26:25] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:26:27] cup
[1:26:28] before I he that eateth and drinketh
[1:26:30] unworldly Edith and drinketh Damnation
[1:26:32] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:26:35] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:26:37] sickly among you in many sleep
[1:26:41] for if we would judge ourselves as what
[1:26:43] brother the Bible was talking about this
[1:26:44] morning we should not be judged but when
[1:26:45] we are judged we are chasten of the Lord
[1:26:48] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:26:51] world praise God see that's that
[1:26:52] separation from family all right we get
[1:26:55] into this family where there's no
[1:26:56] condemnation and then we or we stand the
[1:26:58] ones where there is all right wherefore
[1:27:00] my brethren when you come together to
[1:27:02] eat tarry one for another If any man
[1:27:04] hunger let him eat at home that you come
[1:27:06] out together in the condemnation
[1:27:09] the rest I'm going to say in order when
[1:27:11] I come visit you all right so let's take
[1:27:14] just a moment of Silent prayer
[1:27:17] pray for
[1:27:19] our ministry here
[1:27:21] pray for them people here
[1:27:25] and then ask the Lord to be with us
[1:27:40] dear Lord we're a needy group of people
[1:27:41] father and I pray that you just meet our
[1:27:43] needs today
[1:27:44] let the sick be healed
[1:27:46] let the loss be saved
[1:27:49] and Lord may we continue on with you
[1:27:51] Lord in this
[1:27:52] growth development that we've we've
[1:27:55] started in Lord I pray this should help
[1:27:57] us now help us to grow in you Lord that
[1:27:59] we not be babes that we'll move on with
[1:28:02] you Lord and and be adult Christians

[1:28:09] you'll give it to us Lord thank you for
[1:28:10] the time we have Lord thank you for the
[1:28:12] opportunity to to stand in front of a
[1:28:15] group of people Lord that loves you Lord
[1:28:17] I pray that you just bless us now in the
[1:28:19] furthermore of this part of the service
[1:28:20] in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:28:23] amen
[1:28:23] the Bible said he bless the bread Lord
[1:28:26] thank you for this bread
[1:28:28] we know that many times Lord we we go
[1:28:31] back to to what happened years and years
[1:28:33] ago Lord how they used to keep the bread
[1:28:36] and put it back in the freezer and oh it
[1:28:38] was just it was horrible and then you
[1:28:40] look at Moses when they would hold over
[1:28:43] the bread that Lord you were so you were
[1:28:46] so adamant about doing what you said
[1:28:48] that you would make it just be have
[1:28:51] wiggle tails and and maggots all in it
[1:28:53] well Lord this Bread is made with holy
[1:28:55] hands this Bread is made that's going to
[1:28:57] be destroyed what's left of it tonight
[1:29:00] Lord and be burnt to where nothing else
[1:29:02] will be held over nobody will be able to
[1:29:04] eat it again Lord because we want fresh
[1:29:06] revelation
[1:29:07] we want fresh Manna From Heaven every
[1:29:09] day Lord we ask you to bless this bread
[1:29:12] Lord in Jesus name amen
[1:29:18] yeah man could you imagine you know you
[1:29:19] you beat children of Israel and I'm sure
[1:29:21] these
[1:29:24] like all of us
[1:29:26] we have Rebels
[1:29:29] remember that guy snuck out of his tent
[1:29:31] on Sabbath that time and started picking
[1:29:34] up sticks now you think what the harm is
[1:29:36] to pick up sticks I'm cold I need a fire
[1:29:38] well guess what
[1:29:41] what happened
[1:29:43] God struck him dead
[1:29:45] because you're not supposed to work do
[1:29:47] anything on the Sabbath day and he was
[1:29:48] just picking up sticks but he disobeyed
[1:29:50] the word of God that's how serious God
[1:29:53] is because remember
[1:29:54] God's a good God
[1:29:57] but he also hates
[1:29:59] false Doctrine he also hates us
[1:30:04] not doing what his word says
[1:30:08] but with a loving hand he loves us
[1:30:21] there's no way
[1:30:23] you know we we think about what happened
[1:30:25] in
[1:30:26] in the upper room I mean he had 12
[1:30:29] people with him
[1:30:30] that was it him and 12. and what I'm was
[1:30:33] going to betray him
[1:30:39] he's still handed
[1:30:41] the cup to Judas
[1:30:43] the bread to Judas
[1:30:45] and wash judas's feet knowing in a few
[1:30:47] hours what he was going to do that's
[1:30:49] brotherly kindness dear heavenly father
[1:30:51] thank you for this wine Lord has been
[1:30:53] prepared months and months maybe even
[1:30:55] years ago but lord it's like your word
[1:30:58] it just keeps getting stronger and
[1:30:59] stronger and better and better father I
[1:31:01] pray that you should sanctify it and the
[1:31:02] partakers in Jesus name amen

[1:35:44] okay because he's fixing to dump
[1:35:46] something on Peter right here Jesus said
[1:35:48] if I wash thee not you ain't got no part
[1:35:51] with me
[1:35:52] the man
[1:35:54] I know sometimes we may have issues with
[1:35:57] our feet and stuff but
[1:35:58] if you just take communion and walk out
[1:36:00] the door and don't wash feet
[1:36:03] I'm just reading you what he said
[1:36:05] if the god of Heaven can wash feet
[1:36:09] you can swallow your pride and wash it
[1:36:11] too
[1:36:12] amen
[1:36:13] all of us
[1:36:15] if I wash thee not thou Hast no part
[1:36:18] with me Simon Peter said Lord dump it on
[1:36:22] me not my feet only but also my hands
[1:36:25] and my head Jesus said he that is
[1:36:28] Washington either is not saved to wash
[1:36:29] his feet but it's clean every wet and
[1:36:31] you are clean but not all for he knew
[1:36:33] who should betray him therefore he said
[1:36:34] you're not all clean so after he had
[1:36:38] washed their feet and had taken this
[1:36:39] garment was set down again he said unto
[1:36:41] them know you what I've done to you you
[1:36:43] call me master and Lord and you say well
[1:36:45] for so I am
[1:36:46] if I then your Lord and Master have
[1:36:48] washed your feet you also ought to wash
[1:36:50] one another's feet for I have given you
[1:36:52] an example now if God gives you an
[1:36:55] example
[1:36:56] all right
[1:36:57] pretty good example I would say it's
[1:37:00] probably a perfect example
[1:37:03] for I have given you an example that you
[1:37:05] should do as I have done to you verily
[1:37:07] verily I say unto you the servant is not
[1:37:09] greater than his Lord neither had his
[1:37:11] sin he that is sent greater than he that
[1:37:13] sent him if you know these things
