[4:08] father we thank you Lord for your love
[4:10] and your grace unto us this day thank
[4:12] you for all things because we know and
[4:15] realize Lord that none of us are worthy
[4:18] of anything but yet truly you are
[4:21] worthy all praise honor and Glory goes
[4:24] into your your hands Lord from us
[4:27] because without you where would we be
[4:30] father we pray you would come tonight
[4:32] and just speak to your people use the
[4:35] vessel no matter what would be of of
[4:37] benefit of what we could do or whatever
[4:39] Lord and forgive us when we don't speak
[4:42] according to what you want to be said or
[4:44] done and you just have your way we love
[4:47] you and we thank you be with each one of
[4:49] these be with the sick among us you
[4:51] promised it so we believe you we never
[4:54] did read where that we had to do certain
[4:56] things to be able to accept at our
[4:59] receive it all we had to do is believe
[5:01] you so we thank you and we commit it all
[5:04] into your hands now as we read your word
[5:06] you come to speak to our hearts in Jesus
[5:09] name amen okay Romans 8:23 where we've
[5:14] been reading and then we'll go to
[5:16] Genesis 4 Romans
[5:21] 828 through 31 and then we'll go to
[5:24] Genesis 4 and we know that all things
[5:27] work together for good to them that of
[5:29] God to them who are the called according
[5:31] to his purpose for whom he did Forno he
[5:34] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[5:37] the image of his son that he might be
[5:39] the firstborn among many Brethren
[5:41] moreover whom he did predes whom he did
[5:44] predestinate them he also called and
[5:47] whom he called them he also Justified
[5:49] and whom he justified them he also
[5:52] glorified what shall we then say to
[5:54] these things if God be for us who can be
[5:58] against us amen can anything thing
[5:59] happening to us without him knowing it
[6:02] cuz remember we're still talking on
[6:07] predestination and we're getting now to
[6:09] the point that I'll probably maybe
[6:12] Sunday make an overall length part of a
[6:15] message and then we will try to get into
[6:18] the uh point of back to our points of
[6:22] predestination and start on the
[6:24] predestinated seed might have another
[6:26] message or so before we get there but
[6:29] that's my full intentions is to try to
[6:32] to get back to our original thought cuz
[6:35] to me this is the thought it's just that
[6:37] we're trying to
[6:39] express how life is upon Earth and how
[6:43] that God knew what would
[6:46] happen all right and I hope you've been
[6:48] following it that he knew what would
[6:51] happen so then it didn't pull anything
[6:54] over on him he didn't have to run around
[6:55] and get another plan he
[6:58] immediately
[7:00] even kill the animals as I was covering
[7:03] last week there this sun past Sunday
[7:06] that he even killed those animals to
[7:07] take the Skins to make an atonement and
[7:10] gave us a bloody we'll repeat that again
[7:12] in a little bit because I love it all
[7:14] right but just think about it you may be
[7:17] seated the Lord add his Blessing to the
[7:18] reading of his word and I'll pray in
[7:20] just a second because I got one more
[7:22] scripture so go ahead and be seated
[7:24] James 1 and 15 says cuz this will go
[7:28] into our thought
[7:30] of where we're
[7:31] going then when lust has conceived it
[7:35] bringeth forth sin and sin when it's
[7:38] finished bringeth
[7:40] forth
[7:42] death may the Lord add his Blessing to
[7:44] the reading of the word because that's
[7:46] our prayer always in him all right
[7:52] now we've been as I was saying we've
[7:55] been covering the the beginning
[8:00] and I hope you're catching on to the
[8:03] point of seeing that when the beginning
[8:05] started on Earth and you know beings and
[8:09] whatever then God's predestinated plan
[8:13] would begin to come into view all right
[8:17] and it and it's it's that we'll we'll
[8:19] get to a couple of quotes that we got
[8:21] where brother Brown said it was
[8:24] necessary for his predestinated plan for
[8:28] you know to bring things into view even
[8:30] the loss the the conditions ET Etc but
[8:33] he couldn't make
[8:36] it that's right he could not make it and
[8:39] be just but he could know it and be just
[8:44] right that's my whole point of trying to
[8:46] get to of Adam and Eve he knew what
[8:49] would
[8:50] happen all right and and then knowing
[8:53] what would happen then he could
[8:58] predestinate now now follow this and
[9:00] then we'll get on to our thought he
[9:01] could
[9:04] predestinate that
[9:07] atonement
[9:09] eternally cuz see we're going to get to
[9:10] it one of these days you know about a
[9:12] predestinated seed predestinated
[9:14] eternally right all right now but he
[9:18] could
[9:21] predestinate what it would take
[9:23] to to uh cover mankind right
[9:29] see he had to predestinate that because
[9:33] he knew what was going to happen when we
[9:36] got here right all right and see then he
[9:39] could predetermine
[9:40] it this is not no casual thing of just
[9:43] well you know the sin come then God just
[9:46] decided to do something else about it
[9:48] you know and no no he knew before the
[9:51] world what he was going to
[9:53] do and he predetermined that to be cuz I
[9:57] believe in a predestinated eternal seed
[9:59] amen I
[10:01] do but maybe not the way a lot of people
[10:04] believe it you know but we'll get down
[10:06] to those things and try to bring it into
[10:09] but James
[10:12] says that When sin is
[10:16] finished it brings death
[10:19] amen all right now so we've been trying
[10:23] to cover
[10:25] what the original
[10:28] sin
[10:29] is what
[10:31] unbelief all right that's that's
[10:34] something that everybody should be able
[10:36] to follow no matter what or what church
[10:38] you'd be in you would be able to follow
[10:40] it that
[10:42] way see Eve believed the devil's
[10:46] lie about what God had said right now
[10:51] I'm hoping that dwells in our heart and
[10:52] our lie it wasn't the devil coming up
[10:55] with some new plan you know some new
[10:58] thing that wouldn't have worked with
[11:01] Eve but he went straight to the word of
[11:05] what she
[11:07] understood and he began to not to try to
[11:11] destroy
[11:13] that but to uh would you say interpret
[11:17] or
[11:19] misinterpret either way you want to
[11:20] place it that he would start really the
[11:24] way I look at it he he was trying his
[11:27] best
[11:27] to to get Eve not away from God as the
[11:33] prophet
[11:35] said but he wanted her to doubt God's
[11:38] word or now think about it and you'll
[11:41] see why did it happen as this the devil
[11:44] you know says God knows in the day you
[11:47] eat thereof uh you become as Gods you
[11:49] know knowing good and evil etc
[11:51] etc what was he doing he was trying to
[11:54] tell
[11:55] her
[11:57] okay we we've heard this we know that
[12:01] but surely remember one we gave the
[12:03] prophet said surely God knows he loves
[12:06] you and he wouldn't kill
[12:09] you you know he loves
[12:12] you you're part of his predestinated
[12:17] plan
[12:19] well that can be true but it's according
[12:22] to how you approach it all right now get
[12:25] into the thought for
[12:27] tonight
[12:29] see there's
[12:33] always
[12:35] um like I've always said about it you
[12:38] you you you uh you take Sin Sin being
[12:42] unbelief all right we know that and
[12:44] believe it but there's always a
[12:47] display there's never just something
[12:50] that you're doubting something there's
[12:52] always a display of that there's always
[12:55] an
[12:56] attribute right and we get to it in a
[12:59] minute we know the quotes but it's right
[13:00] in where I want to read from
[13:03] that see
[13:05] sin being
[13:08] unbelief was in the reasoning factors of
[13:11] Eve the second realm of her being
[13:16] whether you want to call it Soul or
[13:17] where you want to call it Spirit just
[13:19] remember it's in the reason memory
[13:21] conscious affections and in that
[13:24] realm he begin to get her to
[13:27] doubt now now think about what I'm
[13:30] saying was it to doubt as much God's
[13:33] word or to doubt that God wouldn't keep
[13:36] his
[13:37] word right now I gave you where the
[13:40] Prophet
[13:41] said she failed on Hebrews 13:8
[13:45] right that's Jesus Christ the same
[13:47] yesterday today and forever well now
[13:49] that's not just to saying letters of a
[13:53] word amen for us to believe Jesus Christ
[13:56] the same yesterday today and forever
[13:58] means that we got to believe that same
[14:00] God you got a lot to be involved in it
[14:03] but really was he trying to get her to
[14:05] disbelieve God or to doubt that he would
[14:09] keep his word amen wouldn't it be a
[14:12] convincing argument to be maybe standing
[14:15] there listening and and Eve that Beast
[14:18] talking to Eve and said now you know he
[14:20] loves you I gave you the quote from the
[14:22] prophets you know he loves you he cares
[14:23] for you he knows what you're going to do
[14:26] and you're going what if it happened
[14:28] this way what if he said and you're
[14:30] going to help him fulfill his
[14:33] predestinated
[14:37] plan come on cuz that's what took place
[14:41] right you can't deny that can you right
[14:46] what if he explained a lot of things to
[14:49] her I don't think it was a f minute
[14:52] conversation you
[14:54] know it could have been days and days
[14:57] and weeks and months
[14:59] of exp
[15:02] explaining to her the great
[15:07] things and got her to doubt God's word
[15:10] or God keeping his word now what about
[15:13] you and
[15:15] I all right now do we doubt God as being
[15:20] God do we doubt him as being
[15:23] real no
[15:26] no the devil don't try he he the devil
[15:30] never tries anymore now he used to come
[15:32] on we all come through it right he used
[15:34] to when I started studying of the one
[15:36] God he try to tell me other fallacies
[15:38] and and thoughts and ideas and opinions
[15:41] and etc
[15:42] etc but see he doesn't do that anymore
[15:46] it's
[15:47] unsettled he can't even approach the
[15:49] idea of a trinity into our minds now all
[15:53] right so we wouldn't even listen to
[15:57] him but what about the deception in the
[16:00] last days through the people of the
[16:02] message that say well now
[16:05] he's God here but he's not God over here
[16:09] our are you know two Lords seven un
[16:11] virtues what about all those doctrines
[16:13] and and even saying that he was not god
[16:16] Till The River
[16:17] Jordan then he became God then he lost
[16:20] his godship then he
[16:23] died now come
[16:25] on I'm not thr off on nobody I'm just
[16:28] telling you
[16:29] amen that's what we believe see and we
[16:31] can take those things into our being and
[16:34] not realize I've talked to a lot of
[16:36] people and express a little about the
[16:39] the two Soul Doctrine and I've had them
[16:42] to tell me so well you know I used to
[16:44] believe
[16:45] that sure
[16:49] well the truth is the only thing that's
[16:51] going to take out what we don't right
[16:53] amen believe all right now brother Mo
[16:57] years ago I remember this came back to
[16:59] me today and I was
[17:00] thinking I remember him preaching a
[17:02] message which he and I discussed it at
[17:05] length he said brother Dale if we ever
[17:10] understand what death really
[17:15] is he said then and only then can we
[17:18] think about conquering it that's right
[17:21] that's right boy that's a you know let
[17:24] that ring into you well you man stand
[17:28] death you die you buried you're
[17:32] gone that ain't the end of you that's
[17:34] right it just takes you out of this
[17:37] existence amen you go into another
[17:39] existence and have to remain until even
[17:42] if you're a
[17:43] sinner to be judged and
[17:47] Etc but you know I've always thought on
[17:49] that point when you find out what death
[17:53] really
[17:55] is then we can talk about conquering it
[18:02] we should be to the place that we
[18:03] wouldn't worry about death because we
[18:05] know that death is only an ability to
[18:07] carry us
[18:08] into the arms of our Lord and savior
[18:11] amen righten all
[18:15] right but yet what's keeping us
[18:20] here see that's the point I want to deal
[18:22] with tonight if you're in the message
[18:24] you watch it what's keeping us here is
[18:27] sin
[18:32] now not as drinking gambling smoking
[18:35] running around women if if that's a
[18:37] problem we already dead don't worry
[18:40] about it that ain't no hopes for
[18:44] that those are only the
[18:48] attributes of unbelief all right we see
[18:51] unbelief is original sin and unbelief is
[18:55] original
[18:56] death and when unbelief is
[18:59] destroyed death will have to go with
[19:03] it come
[19:06] on when unbelief is
[19:10] gone yeah but I just don't know because
[19:12] I have so much unbelief what unbelief do
[19:15] you
[19:19] have I mean you believe in the Trinity
[19:21] well get rid of
[19:24] it you doubt whether the word of God is
[19:27] true by now after what 40 years for some
[19:30] of us and more than
[19:33] that of studying the
[19:36] message now sin is unbelief amen and sin
[19:41] notice what James said when it's
[19:44] finished right amen it brings forth
[19:48] death
[19:50] amen it's like I said the other day
[19:52] where that Eve
[19:54] see when it says the day you eat thereof
[19:57] that day you die
[19:59] well they partook the next day she said
[20:01] Adam I told you God wouldn't going to
[20:03] keep his word because we're supposed to
[20:05] died
[20:08] yesterday they died in A Thousand Years
[20:10] cuz thousand years is a day and the day
[20:11] is a thousand years God was right right
[20:15] but what was their
[20:17] interpretation of that
[20:20] thought I told you that we wouldn't die
[20:23] and we
[20:27] didn't but they was out of the garden
[20:30] too where were they I want to get over
[20:33] to that about Cain being put out of the
[20:36] presence of the
[20:37] Lord but I hold that but think about
[20:47] it remember
[20:49] sin being
[20:53] unbelief and not sin as unbelief like I
[20:57] don't don't believe
[21:00] God and the Bible said he that believeth
[21:02] not is condemned already all right I I
[21:05] don't believe that that's not what I'm
[21:07] talking
[21:08] about Satan can't approach you with
[21:10] trying to get you to believe in another
[21:11] God truly right
[21:13] now I mean the youngest ones Among
[21:17] Us would would argue that point with the
[21:23] devil but yet all he's got to do is to
[21:25] get us
[21:27] to
[21:28] one thing to think that we're not
[21:31] worthy and you know what I agree with
[21:33] him before he ever says it I'll tell him
[21:36] ain't
[21:38] worthy but yet God said I was right
[21:42] amen so I don't have to worry about it
[21:45] right amen I'm going to take what he
[21:46] says
[21:49] amen there was only one sin I was
[21:51] looking at those things but decided not
[21:53] to go that way so much but you know the
[21:55] Bible says there's only one sin under
[21:57] death
[21:59] and Peter or Paul or there one of them
[22:01] said that that's that's the one I tell
[22:02] you you don't have to pray for you know
[22:04] you don't pray for that sin on death why
[22:05] that's blaspheming the Holy Ghost
[22:07] attributing The Works of God to the
[22:09] devil you know in the
[22:12] things but every other sin you pray
[22:16] for but brother Dale I'm a Christian I
[22:19] don't have no sin your Prophet said he
[22:21] sinned every day your Prophet said sins
[22:23] all Christians have sins all right well
[22:27] I just don't don't believe that well
[22:28] you're an
[22:30] unbeliever all right so you're condemned
[22:36] already see watch that as we go through
[22:38] the message
[22:40] now but
[22:42] remember everything has to start with an
[22:49] unbelief but it's easy to hide now I'm
[22:53] not talking about from God I'm talking
[22:55] about us from each other it's easy to
[22:58] hide your
[23:00] unbelief you can sit right there and me
[23:03] preaching on one God after all these
[23:05] years been preaching you can sit right
[23:06] there and say don't believe that well
[23:09] ain't nothing I can do about it cuz I
[23:10] don't know you're thinking
[23:12] that you
[23:16] know but when it comes from a
[23:19] unbelief into an outward
[23:25] act see then I begin to have something I
[23:28] can look
[23:29] at you know all
[23:33] right and you know what that means by a
[23:35] lot of people I don't believe what you
[23:36] preach and they just get to walk out the
[23:37] door right yeah that's a pretty good
[23:40] attribute but it's all right cuz I've
[23:42] never said anybody left here left the
[23:44] word right amen CU that ain't between me
[23:47] and them that's between them and
[23:50] God Amen all
[23:54] right but now think about
[23:56] it
[23:59] Satan does not try to get us to turn
[24:01] against
[24:04] God but he tries to get us to doubt that
[24:09] word as for being for
[24:13] us come on he don't talk to you like
[24:16] that I read something brother brandom
[24:19] says and he says the bride will or the
[24:22] the Bible would say the world is waiting
[24:23] for the manifestation of the sons of
[24:26] God
[24:29] and you know I say
[24:32] Satan God said
[24:35] that but you know what he do well
[24:37] where's it
[24:40] I you
[24:44] know
[24:46] right if we had the word here like we
[24:50] think we have the word here how many
[24:52] times have that been
[24:55] said then it'd be great things taking
[24:59] place I don't try to justify nothing cuz
[25:01] I see great things taking place we've
[25:03] seen the dead raised the sick heal we've
[25:05] seen all kind of things so we don't have
[25:06] to worry about it right but I don't try
[25:08] to justify nothing but I will tell you
[25:10] the truth there's no need of praying for
[25:13] rain in a monso season
[25:15] that's
[25:19] right then what do you mean by that
[25:21] that's what I just
[25:23] mean God is among us but the prophet
[25:27] said he would try this bride to see
[25:30] whether she would fail for Satan's
[25:34] lie well he can't try if he don't pour
[25:37] on the
[25:41] pressure sister asked me to look it up
[25:44] and I got one in there in the office
[25:45] where brother R said you better get used
[25:48] to cold weather cuz they got some places
[25:49] up in
[25:53] Alaska well that's on the internet
[25:55] course that's been 20 30 years ago that
[25:57] they've been talking about that a lot of
[25:59] the brothers used to be here talked
[26:01] about it you know all of these
[26:03] concentration camps in America and all
[26:05] who's
[26:06] worried they can't get us until God gets
[26:09] to with
[26:10] us wouldn't it be
[26:14] nice if we was all put in one place
[26:17] right amen might be a lot of knock down
[26:20] drag out fights but still be better than
[26:22] what we exist and has right we could at
[26:26] least argue and not have to go home you
[26:29] know we'd have plenty of time to discuss
[26:31] what we wanted to
[26:33] discuss that's why I don't worry about
[26:35] it I'm concerned with the one thing
[26:38] that's killing all of
[26:40] us
[26:43] unbelief all right now I've got it in
[26:46] here a time or two to say see a lot of
[26:49] times unbelief is because of lack of
[26:52] understanding
[26:54] right amen right amen lack of
[26:58] understanding leads us in unbelief or
[27:00] lack of understanding you know I'm
[27:02] Southern far sorry
[27:06] folks a lot of people haven't heard this
[27:09] message
[27:10] right and they've not heard it taught to
[27:13] them correctly right amen and see that
[27:16] leads them in
[27:18] unbelief the Bible speaks of it there
[27:20] said you stand in the door talking about
[27:21] the preachers you stand in the door and
[27:23] won't go in and won't let the people go
[27:25] in either right all right
[27:31] unbelief is not always displayed by
[27:35] drinking gambling smoking
[27:40] and that's where I've tried my best to
[27:43] explain it and get into trouble about
[27:46] it a born again Christian cannot
[27:49] disbelieve in their soul right there is
[27:52] no way can be done their inner being
[27:54] Center being what do you want to call it
[27:56] Spirit where you want to call it Soul
[27:58] the center being has only one Faith one
[28:01] thing Faith or
[28:03] doubt so I've tried to
[28:06] explain that that inward part of us
[28:09] called reason memory conscious affection
[28:11] thing there's where the unbelief comes
[28:13] in out
[28:15] am all
[28:17] right because if we sin from our soul
[28:20] we're dead right well how many people
[28:22] wants to hear it like
[28:26] that
[28:28] but think about it
[28:30] now is God trying to get us to turn
[28:33] against even this
[28:36] message I said this what 20 years ago I
[28:40] said you give enough
[28:43] time and I said this will be one of the
[28:45] biggest Cults there ever
[28:48] is and I said it'll be no count how many
[28:52] followers well you look at them now they
[28:54] say there's over a million in Africa
[28:56] alone
[29:01] but I thought the Bible said if Fe not
[29:02] little flock well okay if it was two
[29:04] millions over 5 millions of us believe
[29:06] in it that' still be a small flock
[29:08] compared to 700 billion people in the
[29:10] world all
[29:13] right but you see
[29:16] folks I'm trying to get us to see what's
[29:19] killing
[29:21] us it's not the food we eat sure we know
[29:25] that are we breed sure we know that the
[29:28] water we drink sure we know that but you
[29:31] going to quit
[29:33] drinking you going to quit
[29:37] eating come
[29:39] on you read where one day read one man
[29:42] said sleeps to Too Much sleep's killing
[29:44] you then read another one said not
[29:46] enough sleep's killing you well we ain't
[29:48] worried about
[29:51] sleep it's
[29:56] unbelief unbelief about this
[29:59] message you say well now I I believe
[30:01] everything the prophet
[30:03] says all
[30:05] right but now think about
[30:12] it there's got to be a
[30:16] display of the
[30:18] unbelief and that the prophet would call
[30:21] like paragraph 87 we won't have to get
[30:24] that in brother Joe we'll read it in a
[30:26] minute
[30:29] but drinking gambling smoking the
[30:30] prophet said is not
[30:32] unbelief he said that's an
[30:35] attribute of
[30:37] unbelief or a
[30:40] display right a display a display you
[30:43] can see thought you
[30:46] can't right all
[30:51] right I've went through many things in
[30:54] the past few weeks talking about
[30:57] about how that Satan has attacked the
[31:01] minds of the
[31:02] people to get us to doubt the
[31:05] message as being true
[31:09] amen outside world is not attacking
[31:13] us they don't even know how right that's
[31:16] right
[31:18] amen right but it's right Among Us
[31:24] amen doctrines and ideas all
[31:29] right what about what we were talking
[31:31] about last
[31:34] Sunday when I ask you the
[31:37] question do you believe Cain could have
[31:39] been
[31:42] saved do you know there a lot of people
[31:44] in the message I've heard that over and
[31:45] over ever since I've been in the message
[31:47] that Cain couldn't been saved he serpent
[31:50] seat no serface seed can't be
[31:56] saved
[32:00] but brother brandom I gave it to you off
[32:02] the power of
[32:03] transformation he said came knew the
[32:06] perfect will of
[32:09] God now listen to what he's saying if
[32:11] you want to pull it pull that go and
[32:12] pull it up let them read it brother Joe
[32:15] can you the perfect will of God Brother
[32:17] Anderson I guess it back there I don't
[32:19] know who's on the pole a lot of
[32:22] time but he refused to do it yeah
[32:30] now we put a lot of emphasis listen to
[32:33] this as we're on it we put a lot of
[32:35] emphasis on the difference between Cain
[32:37] and
[32:39] Abel that Abel had a revelation and I
[32:42] agree with
[32:47] that but Cain knew what was
[32:50] right but he wouldn't do it that's
[32:54] right so he knew now let's read the
[32:57] prophet then he can knew the perfect
[33:00] will of God he knew the perfect will of
[33:01] God can't knew it why but he refused to
[33:04] do it he proved then to be the Serpent's
[33:09] Seed when he seen the perfect will of
[33:12] God he refused it watch he had seen God
[33:16] vindicate Abel's message he know that
[33:20] was the will of
[33:22] God now irregardless of
[33:25] what of any
[33:29] thought look at the
[33:32] situation you lay something down I lay
[33:35] something
[33:39] down God consumes your
[33:43] offering that what he done with Elijah
[33:46] and all those prophets and
[33:48] things he consumed the
[33:51] offering and he'd leave M land there
[33:54] well I ought to have enough sense to
[33:56] realize
[33:58] right that there's something wrong with
[34:00] what I
[34:01] done that's right that's right but I
[34:04] won't get to it today I want leave you a
[34:06] little time but I I wish I knew we had
[34:08] these I had one or two written down in
[34:10] my Bible cuz you know how I keep things
[34:12] been doing it for 50 years now about
[34:15] what the prophet said and write it in my
[34:17] Bible where I keep up with it brother
[34:19] Brown said Cain
[34:21] said this is all I'm going to do he said
[34:24] you take it or leave it I wish when you
[34:27] get home cuz it won't bother me reading
[34:29] what I'll read I wish when you get home
[34:32] you'd run in the
[34:33] computer take it or leave
[34:37] it and see how many times R around spoke
[34:40] about that and how many times it applies
[34:43] to you and
[34:46] I I built churches I I go to church I'm
[34:49] in church all the time I
[34:52] worship he said that's telling God take
[34:54] it or leave it
[35:01] okay he know that was the will of God he
[35:06] seen God vindicate Abel's
[35:08] message and what did God say to him he
[35:12] just said do the same do worship like
[35:16] your brother and you'll do well but you
[35:19] see he seen the perfect will of God but
[35:22] he didn't want it see amen he wanted to
[35:24] add something to it right y
[35:28] do like your
[35:30] brother look at the next one power
[35:33] transformation that's on U power trans
[35:36] next one is God's power
[35:39] transformation look what he
[35:42] says he's coming down to Genesis 4 and 6
[35:45] and 7 God said to Cain said why are your
[35:47] countenance Fallen why are you all full
[35:50] of temper walking around you just heard
[35:53] a message that upsets you listen to
[35:57] brother BR said well what are you doing
[36:00] that far why are your countenance fail
[36:04] because I didn't come into your church
[36:07] so why did you do it are you using a
[36:10] thinking man's filter why or or why why
[36:14] are you looking like that said if you'll
[36:16] do well go do like your brother is doing
[36:20] out there I'll receive you and bless you
[36:25] now
[36:27] I wrote it like
[36:30] this for you and I to
[36:34] say after we read
[36:41] this that Cain could not be
[36:44] saved you realize we are in unbelief
[36:48] that's right because your Prophet said
[36:50] it and I gave you the other quotes
[36:52] Sunday on it more than just
[36:55] that yeah but that's my idea about it
[36:58] what are you saying God I've done all
[37:01] I'm going to do take it or leave
[37:04] it brother rold said Cain knew the
[37:08] perfect will of
[37:12] God but he wouldn't do
[37:15] it and said take it or leave
[37:18] it what I've
[37:21] offered take it or leave
[37:24] it you said I wouldn't D do
[37:32] that like my mom used to say she said I
[37:36] born to baptist that I'll probably die
[37:40] one
[37:43] well I love my mother and I hope she'll
[37:45] be there but she made her own judgment I
[37:48] don't have to make nothing for
[37:52] her if God wants me to hear the word
[37:55] he'll send it how many said that he'll
[37:57] send it to the church I mean that's in
[37:59] the
[38:00] message I've had that in my face not for
[38:04] me to try to invite people to come to
[38:05] this church but for them to let me know
[38:07] what they were doing if God wants me to
[38:09] hear it he'll send it to down to my
[38:13] church you don't quote from Brother
[38:16] Bram God's
[38:19] obligated is that a quote God is
[38:22] obligated to put somebody on the pull
[38:25] pit let him send it down to my
[38:28] church but they don't read the others
[38:31] said if your pastor won't stay with the
[38:32] word you get away from your pastor then
[38:35] it don't read them take it or leave it
[38:39] is that what we're
[38:40] saying now all right I try to be
[38:42] sensible you said but brother Dale all
[38:45] people don't have the ability to find
[38:47] the quotes Etc of the Prophet like we do
[38:49] I agree with that that's 100 I agree
[38:52] with that I covered it just a second ago
[38:54] because a lot of times this lack of
[38:55] unbelief is
[38:57] unbelief is a lack of
[38:59] understanding and I know that and God
[39:01] knows
[39:04] that but let me just ask you because
[39:07] this is the way I
[39:09] think I write down the thoughts and this
[39:11] is the way I think I said you say but
[39:13] all people don't have the ability to
[39:15] find the quote of the Prophet like we
[39:19] do that may be
[39:21] true but they have the ability to think
[39:25] that Cain could not be
[39:31] saved where'd he get that
[39:34] from are you read listening to what I
[39:36] said I'm reading to you what I wrote
[39:39] down they don't have the ability but
[39:42] they have the ability to think that Cain
[39:44] could not be
[39:46] saved right where'd he get it
[39:49] from
[39:53] preachers
[39:55] right
[39:58] why would we think any way whatsoever
[40:01] that God would not save
[40:04] Cain do we think we are some
[40:08] special he wouldn't save Cain but yet
[40:11] he'll save
[40:13] me that means you think you're something
[40:21] special but are you listening somebody
[40:24] might not have the ability to quote the
[40:26] it
[40:28] right but they get the ability from
[40:31] somewhere to believe a
[40:35] lie why not search for the truth well
[40:39] I'm afraid brother Dale I might get
[40:40] confused don't worry about it honey you
[40:43] already
[40:47] confused don't be concerned about
[40:49] getting
[40:51] confused that means what you're saying
[40:53] is I don't want to hear more truth can I
[40:56] quote it sister
[40:57] Gil when she told Brother dick said
[40:59] don't tell me no more and I won't be
[41:01] responsible
[41:03] right come on don't you I'm not picking
[41:07] on her cuz every one of us done the same
[41:09] thing
[41:11] right the same thing we all
[41:14] to
[41:16] listen but don't we believe that God
[41:19] would save everybody right if they'd
[41:21] want to be
[41:23] saved you mean it's God's will for some
[41:25] to be lost son to be saved no he would
[41:28] at all be saved that's right
[41:32] right well then why would we come up
[41:34] with a Doctrine see it's an
[41:37] unbelief well see I'm pretty sure
[41:39] probably on the internet Sunday or
[41:41] theight one click it went all I don't
[41:44] agree with what he's are
[41:46] saying you see I can't do anything about
[41:48] that I wish I could
[41:51] but maybe I could find a better way and
[41:53] somebody give me a better education I
[41:55] guess to be able to put my words
[41:57] together beautiful I'm
[42:01] sorry see unbelief brought sin or is
[42:07] sin and sin brings
[42:11] death look at what the prophet of God
[42:13] said in page 66 of the church age book
[42:16] The Ephesian Church age number
[42:18] four he said just to change one
[42:22] word bring sin and death
[42:29] just to change one word look the
[42:31] scripture he going down through other
[42:33] reading if anybody adds to anybody takes
[42:38] from one
[42:40] word all it
[42:46] takes and as I said even I was given it
[42:50] about that God killed the animals but my
[42:54] God can't kill he's a
[43:00] Spirit Well the Bible said he did the
[43:03] prophet said he did I gave it to you
[43:04] there last week paragraph E36 with the
[43:08] way have Fellowship 1955
[43:11] 109 brother R said he set forth a bloody
[43:15] Plan of
[43:18] Redemption he killed the animals we'll
[43:20] get to that in a minute that God was the
[43:23] first one the first death in the garden
[43:25] was not Cain and Abel the first death in
[43:29] the garden was the animals that were
[43:38] sacrificed but
[43:40] see the
[43:43] first
[43:47] death that would be starting the serpent
[43:52] seed would be
[43:55] unbelief
[43:56] that's what's killing us
[44:00] unbelief and brother R said we was born
[44:03] between Eve and the
[44:06] serpent no bless God I born my mom and
[44:11] daddy the prophet said was born between
[44:14] Eve and the serpent right next time you
[44:18] see a snake say hello
[44:23] Daddy no they're not that way right cuz
[44:26] we don't believe that way we believe the
[44:28] Beast was
[44:31] used
[44:34] right but see the first death was death
[44:38] in the spiritual
[44:40] realm of Eve and Adam in their reasoning
[44:44] memory of conscious
[44:49] affections and
[44:52] then
[44:54] God had had to kill the animals y
[44:58] because he knew that death was the only
[45:02] way why didn't he just go down if he say
[45:05] well it's going to be a blood doctor
[45:06] it's going to be a blood why didn't he
[45:08] just go down draw out a little
[45:11] blood and go over to Adam and Eve and
[45:18] go come
[45:23] on no
[45:26] because you remember what the quote we
[45:28] gave
[45:28] you the prophet said the animal was
[45:33] used the Beast was used to pregnate the
[45:37] human race right he said thereby the
[45:40] animal would have to be the
[45:52] atonement then spiritual death
[45:58] brought the death of the animals to make
[46:01] an
[46:02] atonement that's an
[46:05] attribute
[46:08] right spiritual death was unbelief right
[46:11] the natural death was the animals being
[46:15] killed that was an attribute or a
[46:20] display oh God it's so great why did God
[46:23] just say oh I see I see the blood I see
[46:26] the blood no no no no
[46:31] no what are we saying when I see the
[46:34] blood all pass over you not if I think
[46:37] about
[46:40] it all
[46:43] right but see then it went on from there
[46:47] until Genesis 4 and8 Cain actually
[46:51] killed
[46:54] Abel so sin brought
[47:01] death
[47:04] right all death comes starting from
[47:08] unbelief the seed of the serpent
[47:12] unbelief wound up into death
[47:16] physically do you understand what I'm
[47:17] getting at all comes because of
[47:24] unbelief
[47:28] but as I
[47:29] said I want to deal with what is
[47:37] death and see how that death is
[47:42] still following you and I right
[47:47] amen
[47:50] right death is still following
[47:53] us you said what brother Dale why why
[47:55] are we sick it's not because we don't
[47:58] believe in God
[48:01] right that's not what it is that's the
[48:04] fall that's the condition the existence
[48:07] that was brought into being because of
[48:09] the unbelief
[48:13] right but Cain killed
[48:15] Abel an attribute took place a literal
[48:20] happening took
[48:22] place God killed those animals a literal
[48:26] happening took
[48:28] place I don't like you to talk about my
[48:31] God being a killer well I'd invite you
[48:33] to go home take your computer and type
[48:35] in God
[48:40] killed I we should just go on take a
[48:42] computer type it in you on internet type
[48:44] it in cut me off type it in and see what
[48:47] it says come back
[48:51] later and look where your Prophet said
[48:54] God killed Jesus
[48:56] Jesus God killed the
[49:04] lamb you see we do have the ability to
[49:07] study out
[49:10] things but have we run out of the
[49:15] ground we know that in the garden
[49:18] now the sin of
[49:21] unbelief then was
[49:23] displayed by an attri
[49:27] into Eve the Beast Adam
[49:33] Etc and it put them into a bad situation
[49:37] which would be attributes Sara and
[49:40] childbearing U Adam would be your ruler
[49:42] you know the husband would be the ruler
[49:44] Adam would have to work sweat of his
[49:46] brow uh you know things would grow up
[49:49] the ground wouldn't wouldn't do
[49:50] correctly and all
[49:52] things it brought a lot of
[49:54] things
[49:58] but what I want you to think about for a
[50:00] little
[50:01] bit is about Adam and
[50:05] Eve and you'll see why I'm driving it
[50:07] just so
[50:09] much and what I'm driving it is to show
[50:12] you and I what the devil can do with
[50:22] quotes he can kill you with them
[50:27] amen he's done it with the Bible all the
[50:31] years none good no not one next sermon
[50:34] be therefore perfect your father in
[50:36] Heaven is perfect couldn't get it
[50:40] together sa by faith save by works
[50:43] couldn't get it
[50:48] together what about what happened to
[50:51] Adam and
[50:54] Eve
[50:56] and you'll catch on a little bit more
[50:58] what I'm talking about go ahead brother
[50:59] and pull it up but let's start in this
[51:02] this will be taken off the
[51:05] breach which will start paragraph
[51:07] 87 number six of you notes
[51:13] there and that's why I said I wouldn't
[51:14] read that while ago because we'd have to
[51:16] come down to it anyway this is paragraph
[51:19] 887 through about 90 something of the
[51:23] breach between the seven Church ages and
[51:25] the Seven
[51:25] seals 1963 317 e just before the seals
[51:32] broke in case you want to say this
[51:34] before go ahead that's death too now we
[51:38] say sin we just call it sin break it
[51:40] down what is sin a lot of people say
[51:43] drinking committing adultery no that's
[51:46] the attributes of sin see that's what
[51:48] sin causes see but real Sin is unbelief
[51:51] that's where that's where it's named and
[51:53] called out if you you are a Believer you
[51:56] don't do those things but no matter how
[51:59] holy you try to make yourself and how
[52:02] religious you try to be if you do those
[52:04] things you're an
[52:06] unbeliever that's scripture he said not
[52:10] scriptural
[52:11] now something is something's lost and
[52:14] it's groaning it's trying to get back to
[52:17] be to be back to its original condition
[52:20] would you imagine someone falling from
[52:22] the earth down into a deep pit somewhere
[52:23] and was struggling climbing buing they
[52:26] must by some means get out of this pit
[52:28] they're not in their original state and
[52:31] frantically they're screaming they're
[52:33] clawing the walls making a noise or
[52:35] doing some
[52:37] way they're they're groaning because
[52:41] that they want to get back to the
[52:43] original state all right and when a
[52:46] person is struck by diseases aches and
[52:48] pains one time that wasn't that way but
[52:51] they're groaning why they're not right
[52:53] there's something wrong and they're
[52:54] groaning and trying to get back to where
[52:56] they was when they had health and when
[52:58] Nature and people as the Bible said are
[53:00] groaning it shows there something that
[53:01] they're not in their ought to be
[53:04] conditioned they have
[53:05] fallen from somewhere now watch now we
[53:10] don't need anybody to interpret that for
[53:12] us see for of course we know it was
[53:16] eternal
[53:18] life they had fallen from and they lost
[53:22] their claims on eternal life by the Fall
[53:25] of Adam and
[53:26] Eve who fell from eternal life to death
[53:30] in the Garden of Eden and brought all
[53:32] nature under them to
[53:39] death a tree never died before Adam an
[53:42] animal Wouldn't Die before Adam and
[53:44] there's only one thing that cannot die
[53:46] and that's God because he's Eternal and
[53:49] that's the only way we can get keep from
[53:52] dying we have to have eternal life in us
[53:54] to be sons and and Daughters of God but
[53:56] when we when when but when we died as I
[54:00] said in the message this morning to
[54:03] sin and sold out our
[54:05] Birthright cross this Chasm now we're
[54:08] beyond the reach of God on this side on
[54:12] this other side of the
[54:15] chasm now of course when Adam fell to
[54:18] death he brought death upon all creation
[54:21] and he was given free moral agency it
[54:24] was given he them just as we so to make
[54:28] a choice
[54:32] now brother Brown said Adam fell from
[54:35] eternal
[54:37] life to death in the
[54:43] garden got a
[54:49] quote what do you think about
[54:54] it
[54:56] so I'm trying to show you
[54:59] something and show you how that we use
[55:02] the message for what we
[55:09] desire but Brother D you just read Adam
[55:12] fell to
[55:14] death he fell from eternal
[55:20] life now why would he say
[55:24] that
[55:26] when just a few months prior to
[55:32] then on Blasphemous
[55:35] names he said that God breathed into the
[55:38] nostrils of
[55:39] Adam eternal
[55:44] life now go ahead we'll read that just
[55:47] to make sure where anybody on the
[55:48] internet and things can can read
[55:51] it then we'll get back to her
[55:54] thought
[55:55] what I'm
[55:57] saying things that look so
[56:02] contradictory generally has a
[56:04] simple
[56:08] sensible
[56:10] understanding but it takes a simple
[56:13] sensible understanding and then let it
[56:15] be
[56:16] revealed now I I'm saying this so that
[56:20] you'll think about
[56:21] it and the reason I read
[56:25] that Cain knew the perfect will of
[56:32] God but wouldn't do
[56:35] it was to lay it down that tonight that
[56:38] I can say these two things it looks
[56:40] totally contrary and then make a
[56:42] sensible
[56:46] answer and let's see what you'll do with
[56:48] it internet people
[56:50] whatever see what you'll do with
[56:53] it try to show you the perfect will of
[56:58] God let's see what you do with
[57:02] it we just read that Adam fell from
[57:05] eternal life to
[57:09] death right now look what he says from
[57:12] blasphemian 9 he's preached 11:04 in the
[57:15] morning and this was the three so it's
[57:18] about 4 five months somewhere in four
[57:21] months he's talking about the soul and
[57:24] what the things are and how that people
[57:27] breathe this and they breathe you take
[57:29] the scripture from back there and God
[57:31] breathed breath into his nostrils and he
[57:32] became a living soul and see he's
[57:35] explaining absolutely the things watch
[57:38] now I want to ask you
[57:39] something back come back down okay if he
[57:44] was a man what kind of breath was he
[57:45] breathing before God breathed the breath
[57:47] of eternal life into him now you can
[57:49] take that right there and you can argue
[57:51] either way you want to with that
[57:53] quote
[57:58] but remember my
[58:01] understanding okay no
[58:05] problem I believe Adam was created Body
[58:08] Spirit and soul
[58:11] Adam all right if he had been created
[58:14] body and spirit and then God just put
[58:16] his life in there there wouldn't have
[58:18] been
[58:19] Adam that would have been
[58:22] Jesus because that's what happened with
[58:25] Jesus amen So Adam was created Body
[58:28] Spirit and soul then God breathed into
[58:30] his nostrils now you can argue that
[58:32] quote back as Force go ahead and argue
[58:34] how you want
[58:35] to he said I think he said well go ahead
[58:38] you got a right to think according to
[58:39] the
[58:41] Constitution but what if he was a man
[58:44] what kind of a breath was he breathing
[58:45] before God breathed his breath of life
[58:47] into him see what kind of a breath he
[58:49] was a breathing living man well then if
[58:52] that be so then every animal is a living
[58:54] Soul see you you can argue the point
[58:55] backwards and forth because they breathe
[58:58] human soul and our soul and all together
[59:01] because see that's the African way of
[59:03] you breathing out and breathing in
[59:04] that's not talking about what God makes
[59:06] you then Jesus wouldn't have had to Die
[59:08] the animal sacrifice would have been
[59:10] sufficiency so brother the argument
[59:12] don't stand now but God did roll it on
[59:16] up what God did he breathed the breath
[59:18] of eternal life
[59:21] amen then he we know who he talking
[59:23] about Adam right then he became a living
[59:26] Soul a soul that can't
[59:29] die now watch now we're going to get
[59:33] into honey plumed her elbows not notice
[59:35] breathed the breath of eternal life into
[59:37] his nostrils and he became an eternal
[59:39] Soul because God breathed not what
[59:42] nature done but what now what's nature
[59:45] done nature gives us we know it comes
[59:47] from God but we call it nature gives us
[59:50] you know life Etc all right not what
[59:53] nature done but what God God did breathe
[59:55] the breath of life into his nostrils and
[59:57] he became a living Soul then you say to
[59:59] me Adam died brother
[1:00:01] brandom watch but remember before Adam
[1:00:04] died he had a lamb that redeemed him
[1:00:06] Hallelujah those who forew he has called
[1:00:09] he had a lamb to redeem them he was a
[1:00:11] top Adam fell then the lamb was provided
[1:00:14] for Adam because already in his nostrils
[1:00:16] had become the breath of the Eternal God
[1:00:19] and he had become a living Soul he was a
[1:00:22] Son of God not his breath as Africa
[1:00:25] word I don't know what the Greek word is
[1:00:27] for and all but the African word means a
[1:00:29] more your animals breathe a more your
[1:00:31] all right then why would we struggle
[1:00:33] pull it on
[1:00:35] up why would we struggle for eternal
[1:00:38] life if you just breathe it in and
[1:00:42] out let me ask another thing if it's
[1:00:45] like everybody in the message says we
[1:00:47] come here with eternal life already in
[1:00:48] us why would we search for eternal life
[1:00:53] amen
[1:00:55] I like
[1:00:58] questions
[1:01:00] right watch them questions their gender
[1:01:04] Strife heyen for The
[1:01:07] Strife why there must needs be heres
[1:01:11] among you that they that are approved
[1:01:12] may be made manifest come on let's quote
[1:01:15] a lot of scripture all right but look
[1:01:17] what happened why would we struggle for
[1:01:19] eternal life if it's just what you
[1:01:21] breathe it backfire brother you can't do
[1:01:23] it but God specially lip on Adam
[1:01:25] breathed the breath of eternal life and
[1:01:27] he became an eternal person with
[1:01:30] God he had power like God he was an
[1:01:32] amateur God he was a god of the earth
[1:01:34] not God Of Heaven now God of the earth
[1:01:37] and someday these sons of God will again
[1:01:39] become Gods all right now why would a
[1:01:44] prophet
[1:01:46] say here in Blasphemous
[1:01:49] names that God
[1:01:52] breathed into Adam's nostril eternal
[1:01:55] life and he became an eternal person
[1:01:57] with God then he gets over in the seal
[1:02:01] book and says or the breach and
[1:02:04] says Adam fell from eternal
[1:02:09] life to death in the
[1:02:12] garden now if those two don't come
[1:02:14] together you're going to have to show me
[1:02:16] where he corrected
[1:02:17] it or said he was wrong over here and
[1:02:20] right over here and whatever you know oh
[1:02:23] of course Brother D that's progress
[1:02:24] pressive Revelation those were
[1:02:26] 62 and this is 63 that's
[1:02:31] Progressive well let's go backwards
[1:02:33] forwards and just find out
[1:02:39] something let's just
[1:02:44] ask the prophet a
[1:02:47] question is God an Indian
[1:02:53] giver
[1:02:55] the prophet says no is
[1:02:57] not number
[1:03:00] eight paragraph
[1:03:03] 55 of Hebrews chapter
[1:03:07] 6 you'll make mistakes you'll fall you
[1:03:10] willfully do
[1:03:12] wrong I've heard that preached over and
[1:03:14] over to True Christian can't willfully
[1:03:16] do wrong the prophet said we can so that
[1:03:18] settles out you'll go out sometime and
[1:03:21] do things that don't mean that you're
[1:03:22] lost that means you going want to get
[1:03:24] correction like his little boy says you
[1:03:26] know what to expect when they do it
[1:03:28] they're going to get a whipping for it
[1:03:30] sometime sometimes a good one but it's
[1:03:33] still your children it's impossible for
[1:03:36] that man to ever be gone
[1:03:40] again it's impossible for you to ever be
[1:03:43] gone again what if you're saved that's
[1:03:46] once been born of eternal
[1:03:49] life God is not an ending Giver he that
[1:03:52] heareth my words and believeth on me as
[1:03:55] everlasting life never come into the
[1:03:56] Judgment pass from death into life
[1:03:58] that's God's promise is God an ending
[1:04:01] giver no he's not an ending giver than
[1:04:03] you no look the next one number nine
[1:04:07] paragraph 145 questions and answerers
[1:04:09] 61115 morning service he's talking about
[1:04:13] Saul a man telling him that Saul was
[1:04:18] lost all right go back and read above
[1:04:20] and everything he's telling him Saul was
[1:04:22] lost he said well Saul could not be
[1:04:24] saved if you become an enemy of God you
[1:04:26] remember the scripture said you become
[1:04:28] an enemy of God but you don't go on to
[1:04:32] the rest of it where that Samuel told
[1:04:34] Saul said tomorrow you and I going to be
[1:04:37] together well everywhere Saul is that's
[1:04:41] where Samuel
[1:04:43] is are the Bibles wrong somewhere
[1:04:48] right I said Saul was saved oh he said I
[1:04:51] said he was a prophet he had to be saved
[1:04:54] God saved him now I want to get on that
[1:04:57] predestinated gifts one of these days
[1:04:59] you'll find out about them prophets and
[1:05:01] things
[1:05:02] all God's not an ending Giver as we call
[1:05:05] it you know well if God gave you the
[1:05:07] Holy Ghost knowing that he's going to
[1:05:09] lose you right down here why what a
[1:05:12] foolish thing it would be for him to
[1:05:15] give you the holy ghost in the first
[1:05:19] place God's not an Indian
[1:05:22] giver God's not an Indian
[1:05:27] Giver so why would a prophet
[1:05:31] say that Adam received eternal life and
[1:05:34] if you want some more we'll be glad to
[1:05:36] read it and find some more you
[1:05:39] know but then turn around and say that
[1:05:41] Adam fail from eternal
[1:05:46] life what actually happened in the
[1:05:48] garden to Adam and
[1:05:52] Eve first off Adam body and Eve's body
[1:05:55] was not Eternal you agree Amen brother
[1:05:58] brandham says on the message the future
[1:06:01] home paragraph 431 432 that his youth
[1:06:05] was continually going on he was
[1:06:10] not his body was not
[1:06:13] Eternal so what happened to
[1:06:21] Adam why would a prophet say he fell
[1:06:23] from ET
[1:06:29] life all right death
[1:06:33] brought sin brought death to the
[1:06:36] body according to Genesis
[1:06:39] 3:22 let's put them out of the garden L
[1:06:41] they partake of the tree of life and
[1:06:44] live
[1:06:46] forever it didn't say Eternal it said
[1:06:50] forever all
[1:06:53] right cuz Adam's Body was not
[1:06:56] Eternal Adam's body is in the ground
[1:06:59] right of course you can believe Adam
[1:07:01] come up in the resurrection do whatever
[1:07:03] I do too not exactly like a lot of
[1:07:05] people do but I believe it
[1:07:08] too but I believe what the prophet said
[1:07:10] to one of these days Adam will reach
[1:07:12] over and Shake Eve and Eve will reach
[1:07:13] over and shake shake Abel and Abel will
[1:07:15] reach over and Shake Seth and up will
[1:07:17] come to Resurrection I believe that too
[1:07:19] all right
[1:07:21] now I believe that whatever thing Adam
[1:07:25] lost that Jesus Christ is going to
[1:07:28] restore
[1:07:29] amen that's
[1:07:31] right I believe like the prophet said
[1:07:33] said he proved he's going to restore it
[1:07:35] but says cause he stood right there
[1:07:37] created walked on water he done all kind
[1:07:39] of
[1:07:40] things but back to the point
[1:07:43] now if Adam had eternal life in his soul
[1:07:46] and was an eternal person with
[1:07:49] God then what is the prophet talking
[1:07:51] about when he
[1:07:52] said
[1:07:56] that Adam fell from eternal
[1:07:58] life to death in the
[1:08:03] garden look like contradictory doesn't
[1:08:07] it well which one do you want well I'll
[1:08:11] take the one after I'll take
[1:08:17] four but you see most of you that been
[1:08:19] around here a long time you've heard me
[1:08:20] preach this for about 40 years
[1:08:27] and it's exactly right brother RS right
[1:08:29] in both places right
[1:08:33] amen as brother RS right exactly in
[1:08:35] Blasphemous names when he breathed into
[1:08:37] Adam's nostrils and he become an eternal
[1:08:40] person with
[1:08:41] God but he's exactly right over in the
[1:08:43] seal book when he said Adam fell from
[1:08:45] eternal life amen that's right to
[1:08:50] death now show me where that he ever
[1:08:54] said Adam fell from eternal life and
[1:08:56] went to
[1:08:57] hell I want to
[1:09:01] quote no way I've studied it 40 some
[1:09:04] years you ain't going to find
[1:09:06] it help yourself searching you might
[1:09:09] find a lot of other good
[1:09:12] things but you
[1:09:14] see a simple form or
[1:09:17] illustration is all it
[1:09:20] takes Adam never reached eternal life in
[1:09:23] body that's right because of the Fall he
[1:09:26] fell from that place and he died amen so
[1:09:32] he fell to
[1:09:34] death in the
[1:09:37] garden he fell from living
[1:09:40] eternally in Body Spirit and
[1:09:47] soul you see church because I can look
[1:09:50] right at it and stand here and talk to
[1:09:51] you about it that you and I have eternal
[1:09:53] life and our soul but our body and
[1:09:55] spirit is not
[1:09:58] Eternal amen and we're still in that
[1:10:00] Fallen
[1:10:01] condition but I can say what Adam lost
[1:10:04] Jesus restored
[1:10:06] am he proved it
[1:10:09] amen he
[1:10:14] died come
[1:10:16] on Jesus
[1:10:22] died he went to
[1:10:25] hell he was raised back
[1:10:29] up but to God in him didn't die
[1:10:34] amen that's right and only released the
[1:10:37] ability by death of the body we call
[1:10:41] Jesus for him to be able to
[1:10:44] finish the Plan of Redemption or the
[1:10:47] ways and he went to hell for you and I
[1:10:49] and his soul right and he preached to
[1:10:51] the spirits that were in prison then he
[1:10:53] comes back up and picked up the Old
[1:10:55] Testament Saints right
[1:10:57] right and then he came back up and
[1:10:59] picked up his own body
[1:11:02] amen so Jesus the body died
[1:11:06] am but he never fail from eternal life
[1:11:12] right cuz the Bible had already said
[1:11:14] I'll not leave my soul in hell and see
[1:11:17] my Holy One reap
[1:11:22] corruption what don't should apply that
[1:11:24] to you and I amen he's done been to Hell
[1:11:27] For Us amen paid the price we don't have
[1:11:30] to go
[1:11:33] amen we don't have to do none of
[1:11:35] that he'll not leave my soul even in
[1:11:40] Paradise as we call it is taken up in
[1:11:42] the New Testament he's not going to just
[1:11:44] even leave it
[1:11:46] there an eternal condition existing of
[1:11:49] brother Brandon beyond the curtain of
[1:11:51] time he's not going to leave it there
[1:11:54] why because brother of Brown's Body was
[1:11:57] on
[1:12:00] Earth the Lord Jesus was down paying the
[1:12:02] price and preaching to the lost his body
[1:12:06] was in the grave dead
[1:12:10] y but it was raised up am Adam never
[1:12:15] lost eternal life and went to
[1:12:18] hell because if he lost eternal life
[1:12:21] where would he be going
[1:12:28] don't think I don't
[1:12:30] think you say well what it was and Adam
[1:12:32] died back there but Jesus Paid the price
[1:12:34] and then he could come back up and
[1:12:40] live just
[1:12:43] remember Adam had eternal
[1:12:47] life in his
[1:12:51] soul he was the example son that God
[1:12:54] wants you and I to
[1:12:56] be and then death has no problems over
[1:13:00] me no sting no
[1:13:04] troubles it's my
[1:13:07] master can't take me to God gets through
[1:13:10] with
[1:13:10] me but I hope you understand what I'm
[1:13:13] getting at Adam
[1:13:15] fell from the position that he should
[1:13:17] have went on into total eternal
[1:13:22] life but Body Spirit Soul everything
[1:13:24] would went right on in and the fall not
[1:13:27] come but because of the fall and the
[1:13:29] death it brought it throwed you and I
[1:13:31] into this condition that we exist in
[1:13:34] that even though we have eternal life in
[1:13:36] our soul in our body and our spirit is
[1:13:40] still Satan's domain that he
[1:13:44] can do
[1:13:48] everything so he didn't fall to death
[1:13:51] like death like hell or
[1:13:55] gone he just never
[1:13:58] achieved the
[1:14:00] place that it should have been should
[1:14:02] have been that's right amen if I die
[1:14:08] today I've always told my wife I said
[1:14:10] you don't have to worry about me anyway
[1:14:12] I said just take my old body out and
[1:14:14] throw it off on the side of the road let
[1:14:16] it rotten CU was it matter I said I want
[1:14:20] have to dig my way out of the
[1:14:22] grave
[1:14:24] who worries about it she said you ain't
[1:14:25] going to have nothing to do with it cuz
[1:14:26] you'll be gone well all
[1:14:29] right but if I die today don't say I
[1:14:34] died that's what I'm talking about death
[1:14:36] see we talk about death as being where
[1:14:38] you just breathe that last breath and
[1:14:40] you're
[1:14:43] gone it was a little girl one time or a
[1:14:47] child no let's get it right there was a
[1:14:50] man named
[1:14:52] Nicodemus
[1:14:54] that had
[1:14:56] died and his soul had left his
[1:14:59] body the prophet even one time said
[1:15:01] maybe four days out there somewhere you
[1:15:07] know where is it Lazarus let me get my
[1:15:09] Nam right okay thank
[1:15:15] you and Jesus was trying to explain to
[1:15:18] them
[1:15:20] disciples and he says Lazarus
[1:15:26] sleepeth and they said well great he's
[1:15:29] resting he'll be better what's the best
[1:15:33] thing for sickness rest what do the
[1:15:35] doctor tell you go home and
[1:15:37] rest let the body work itself you
[1:15:42] know so finally he gets around to it and
[1:15:45] he says now listen Brothers I'm trying
[1:15:47] to tell
[1:15:49] you without it being so sarcastically a
[1:15:52] wrong way but Lazarus is
[1:15:59] dead but I'm going to go wake
[1:16:04] him because he ain't dead like dead like
[1:16:07] separated like dead dead
[1:16:09] dead cuz that don't even happen to a
[1:16:11] sinner when a sinner dies he got a place
[1:16:14] to go
[1:16:20] to I said I'm going to go wake him
[1:16:23] brother Brown said when he stood there
[1:16:25] he said maybe that body that Soul was
[1:16:26] out three or 4 days or whatever he said
[1:16:30] he simply just called it back
[1:16:36] amen what if you had a choice like some
[1:16:39] people did one
[1:16:42] time when their child had
[1:16:44] died don't up in age a little bit they
[1:16:48] come to brother brandham to ask him
[1:16:50] about
[1:16:51] it y
[1:16:53] he said 'I
[1:16:56] searched the reals of the
[1:16:59] lost and said I can't find
[1:17:02] him said thereby must be in the Realms
[1:17:06] of the
[1:17:08] just said now if you want me to I can
[1:17:11] call him
[1:17:15] back they said no if that's where he's
[1:17:20] at let him stay there amen
[1:17:24] yeah wouldn't that be
[1:17:26] something see death we think is just
[1:17:28] dying it's just well l a poor old
[1:17:31] brother you know he's
[1:17:34] dead you ain't even
[1:17:37] there if you ever walk through like that
[1:17:39] and walk and look down in my casket just
[1:17:41] look over in the corner and I'll wave at
[1:17:50] you you said that's silly it's not silly
[1:17:54] it's
[1:17:56] truth brother BR said he let them saints
[1:17:59] look over the banister
[1:18:01] sometime see what's going on see we
[1:18:05] don't make it
[1:18:09] real the Bible says The Last Enemy to be
[1:18:12] destroyed is
[1:18:13] what
[1:18:16] death death and hell is cast into what
[1:18:20] lake a fire which is the second death
[1:18:27] death we better worry about that
[1:18:30] death I ain't concerned about getting
[1:18:32] killed or
[1:18:40] dying what is
[1:18:43] death we keep on dying I was thinking
[1:18:47] about it today I thought well Lord you
[1:18:49] know what if you don't come pretty quick
[1:18:51] death's going to take a bunch of us
[1:18:53] cuz that's just
[1:18:55] natural I mean it's natural a lot of us
[1:18:57] is the 70s you
[1:19:00] know and he you know I mean you ain't
[1:19:03] promised much more that's as far as you
[1:19:05] promised I done reach that goal I'm on
[1:19:08] bar time some of you bared a whole lot
[1:19:11] more time than I've
[1:19:14] bared but who worries about
[1:19:20] dying but if we can find that out what
[1:19:23] death really
[1:19:25] is and it all ties to the
[1:19:31] unbelief we can conquer
[1:19:33] it that's these brothers in
[1:19:36] karate that's little Zach back there in
[1:19:41] Kate they teach you to have no
[1:19:43] limitations in your mind because if you
[1:19:45] got limitations in your mind you limit
[1:19:47] the
[1:19:49] body come on I told you the guy that
[1:19:52] broke the water first 4 minute do I get
[1:19:54] that right 4 minute mile he was an
[1:19:56] invalid at Birth or whatever he was he
[1:19:58] couldn't even
[1:20:01] run but you know what they just forgot
[1:20:03] to tell
[1:20:04] him and he got to walking and he got to
[1:20:07] run and and they forgot to tell him he
[1:20:09] couldn't break that 4minute mile you
[1:20:11] know what he did he broke
[1:20:19] it the prophet said we'll just walk
[1:20:21] right through death that's what the
[1:20:23] scripture
[1:20:27] says
[1:20:30] death is
[1:20:33] my
[1:20:35] helper or whatever you want to call it
[1:20:38] I'm his
[1:20:45] master until God gets to with me then
[1:20:49] who wouldn't want to
[1:20:50] go you know
[1:20:54] but we stay here for one another
[1:21:00] right you know what I'm talking about
[1:21:02] you look at somebody and they'll be
[1:21:03] doing pretty good and even in the
[1:21:04] natural and they'll be doing all right
[1:21:07] maybe the husband dies
[1:21:09] and like Brother Gary he's listening in
[1:21:13] his who was his mom died there his daddy
[1:21:16] died daddy died one
[1:21:20] Saturday the next Saturday she he
[1:21:26] died she just didn't want to
[1:21:28] live sister Tatum passed
[1:21:31] on and brother Tatum just never did talk
[1:21:34] no more about wanting to live he talked
[1:21:38] about going on over being with her
[1:21:41] amen right talk to the
[1:21:44] nurses is that the way it is talk to the
[1:21:46] doctors the first thing is try to get
[1:21:48] you to
[1:21:49] believe because if we can believe we can
[1:21:52] conquer death let's stand come on
[1:21:54] Brothers sin brought
[1:21:58] death but belief will bring
[1:22:03] life I all things are possible what we
[1:22:08] say with God but that ain't what the
[1:22:09] scripture says scripture said all things
[1:22:11] are possible to them that
[1:22:18] believe we want to see death destroyed
[1:22:20] Just Keep On Believing God's word right
[1:22:22] right that's right you tell me what else
[1:22:24] I can do if shouting or do it we'll
[1:22:27] start an oldfashioned shouting real

[1:22:33] you which one's it going to
[1:22:36] be no I'm not against it I love
[1:22:38] it amen but I know they ain't but one
[1:22:42] thing can conquer death and that's God's
[1:22:48] word God's word you say no he conquered
[1:22:50] it that's what his word says
[1:22:54] that he conquered it what we got brother
