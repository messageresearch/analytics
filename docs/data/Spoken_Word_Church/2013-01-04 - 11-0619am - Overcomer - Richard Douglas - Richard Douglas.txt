had a lot of fish and hush puppies and slaw and things laying out and and everybody was just eating and having a big time and you sitting around an old campfire back in the woods where there's no electric lights or anything there is some old porta potties but that's the best they can do back in there and but it turned out real good so we we appreciate all of it if the girls had a big time they

turned out real good and we appreciate it let's just sing Open the Eyes of My Heart as brother Douglas comes to bring the word of the Lord unto us today we appreciate amen Open the Eyes of My Heart foreign foreign ER maybe see you for just a moment I want to greet you all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen I want to say God bless you another problem said that's the greatest thing we can say to one another is God Bless you that's that's what I wanted to do I wanted to bless us in this service this morning songs called the master of the sea one night upon the sea a ship was tossing to and fro Breakers dashed on every hand angry winds around it blows that's right all on board were filled with fries as the mighty Billows road then they called upon the one through the winds and Waste Control that's right when he reaches out his hands Bill OC set his command s what man is calm life throws upon like she's day the master of Ross which is how we'll see you'll see this has surgery what man is this they all the same way games away oh my what a mighty God no matter what trouble or what trial we go through we know that we have the master of the sea on board amen he was able to keep us in this time that's right I'm sure when I'm so thankful for his grace and mercy let's see each and every one of you amen I love and appreciate each and every one of you I'm just glad to be walking without that boot the Lord touched my foot and I'm about to get around now I feel like I can run the last mile home now amen we just appreciate God for his rest and mercy appreciate that one of his prayers you know God's A Healer right he works in mysterious ways and he definitely gave me a the understanding of how much we need one another because when one part of the body suffers the whole body suffers so we should come together in the unity and whatever someone else is going through we'll be able to take it in prayer and say Lord we know that because they're suffering we're suffering too and you're suffering so right we're thankful that God's always mindful of those things in our life once you stand for the reading of the word this morning just a little simple thought that a little give me I'm just a simple man I just have five smooth stones and just a small slingshot but it seems to get the job done with the off with when God operates the right operates the sling and everything else right that's it comes in place man appreciate it really damn brother Wayne he's appreciate blood now he's taking us out last night and showing us such great Fellowship him and his wife yeah I appreciate it every one of you like when you turn women to the book of Saint Luke chapter 4. I'd like to read small passages of scripture this morning I still love the Lord amen amen I love him so much I can never say enough about how good he's been to me he's he's been so good with all this going and on with endless testimonies of his arrest I like this part right here St Luke chapter 4 verse one going down through to verse 14. and Jesus I like this being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness being 40 days tempted of the devil not just any amen but Satan himself right and in those days he had eaten nothing and when they were ended he afterward hunger and the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command this Stone Let It Be Made bread and Jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live my bread alone but by every word of God and the devil taking him up into a high mountain showed him all the kingdoms of the world in the moment of a Time and the devil said unto him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomever whomsoever I will give it if thou therefore will worship me all shall be thine and Jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve and he brought him to Jerusalem and sent him on the Pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down from hence for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee at least at any time thou Dash thy foot against the stone and Jesus answered and said unto him it is said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God and when the devil had entered ended all the Temptation he departed from him for a season and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and went out of Fame of him throughout all the region around the Bible oh God sweet Eternal and righteous God fatherly back in your spirit here this morning Father each and every one of us had brung a little little flick of fire father Lord I pray that the pillar of fire would father be in our midst this morning Father that you would just come down father and minister to us father this morning for a father I'm hungry too Lord father we want to we want your spirit and we want your grace and we want your mercy father to take preeminence over this service father we want the power of God to move from the back door to the pulpit father we want an outpouring of your Holy Spirit upon us this morning Father we've come hungering and thirsting for righteousness now father we want to be filled father and we claim it this morning because finally you said in your word if we'd ask anything according to your will oh God that's your will this morning that you would have preeminence in every heart this morning Paul I pray Lord Jesus should give us father the desires of our hearts this morning father I pray major needs of everyone here father May the power of the god father the preaching of the word oh God may it come forth in the power of the demonstration of the Holy Ghost father May every demon power father every Spirit father tries to come against you may come just like Satan did Father may it be defeated this morning by the word of God and the word of God Alone Lord father we're thankful this morning for your grace and mercy and father as many churches father around this area this morning have beckoned you to come and invited your father but father your little bride wants your welcome here this morning Jesus you're welcome here this morning you can do whatever you want to do to us Lord father whatever you want to say to us Just Have Your Way father we submit ourselves completely into thy hands for thy honor and for thy Glory this morning have your Divine willing way father for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen you may be seated amen oh my I like what it says right here it says let me it Jesus it seemed like when Jesus after he just come from right here he just went down to the water brother Wade and he'd just been baptized John had baptized the Lamb of God Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away to sin the world here he goes down for the washing of the lamb and you would think he would have probably went right into his ministry right then but it said in Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness I think a lot of times the spirit the spirit of God leads us into these things that we might be Overcomers like Jesus was here because he didn't give us he just didn't hand us a picnic basket this morning he ended as a sword and a shield in the armor of God he put us right into battle this morning and we want to talk about this morning Overcomers we only talk about the things that Jesus showed that he would overcome all right man so we'll overcome also it's just being 40 days tempted of the devil not because he demon but Satan himself come to challenge Our God right amen amen and the word of God will defeat Satan Anytime Anyplace anywhere under any condition right now he says in the devil said unto him Son of God command this tone Let It Be Made bread however he didn't know that is the god that our God was not a God that had to depend upon natural elements the first thing we we have to do the first thing we have to overcome is just flesh yeah don't come this flesh and right here he was showing you how to defeat the advertisement of the flesh is to prayer and pasting and Satan coming his weakest moment you know when a man is hungry he'll steal kill and destroy to get the food in his body amen but Jesus was showing here that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word she is out in the mouth of God right on this morning that's what we live on in every word of God we see this Satan come with this major assault to attack our Lord but when he defeated him he took him right back to the word of God every time right here's Satan comes again with this great assault the second time trying to get Jesus to put on a show for you all right but a lot of times Satan hotels with you is really a son or daughter got you to do this or you'd have done that you disproved yourself all right we have nothing to prove the words already prove themselves amen that's right right yep sorry so they took him up on a took him up into a high mountain showed him the prophet God said he showed him every Kingdom even the U.S show him every Kingdom let's run a product to preach a message the God of this evil age amen he said they'll be yours never yours to see he was trying to get him to come the easy route by the way Satan tries for me and you to give up our land yep yep I land in our boundaries to go an easier route right oh yeah see we had to possess every land he said footsteps or possession Jesus wanted to possess it and his footsteps had to possess the land right man right and here Satan says come on up here come on up here and I and the devil see the devil said unto him all this power will I give thee right and the glory of them he was attacking him here the lust of the eye he let him see these things and said look you won't have to go to the Cross I'll make it easier for you Satan tries to attempt me and you many times Lefty won't have to go this way all right he tried to tempt the prophet but the prophet said when there's anointed come on little Danny Henry he spoke to him he said the calls you have chose the hard way which is my way God's way is a hard way but he'll give us the land amen amen that's right his tires to possess that's right come up here and I'll give it to you the glory of it man he said it's mine and to whomsoever that I want to I'll give it to you if thou will just worship me right see Satan he every sister fall he is desired worship that's right that's what caused you to work the phone was he wanted to exalt himself all right amen above the Throne of God Amen in the bottom of the stars of God and be worshiped right as God Satan sits in many churches and is the receiving worship while the people think their worshiping God but our God as he told the woman that the will has required me and you right to worship him not only his Spirit but in truth right many have the spirit right and many have the truth but when you get a boat together see Jesus wants to Spirit at the truth come on brother he said it and Jesus said unto him get me behind me Satan he used the word alive exactly Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only amen amen is that your total desire this morning amen if there's anything in your heart that you give preemness over God that you are giving worship we have to be very careful because our car is going to come right right her job can become our goal I wise give me come our God our pastor can become our known all right but let me say there's only one true and living God and that's Jesus Christ and he's a jealous God he's jealous this morning right he's jealous over you Church of the Living God he wants you to worship him right he wants you to praise him and spirit of Truth amen he desires Fellowship right Battleship with his wife right right good with a wife is she never fellowship with her husband and me and you having the unmerited band of Grace on our fingers we're just waiting on the marriage supper I tell you if we're not married here we'll meet no suffer over there the meds take place here from the word and the bride become one oh see Satan trying to overpower many men have sold themselves out for this power amen this power and the glory of this world Amen that they might be popular that they might receive things more easier right that's right see Satan is always trying to provide an easy way he told Eve deny one word all right he didn't tell her there was no God brother Wayne he didn't tell her that that God wouldn't that God wouldn't do what he said he would do he just said today you know you should not surely die because he's a good girl but Brown says Satan presented him as a funny dirty old grandpa all right but God's not a grandpa God don't have grandchildren God has Sons and Daughters of God I'm thankful this morning for that that's right I'm glad that I I think God's not my granddaddy he's my father he's my heavenly father all right he has created us amen oh I'm thankful for his mercy and Grace he says that he brought him with him to Jerusalem the most religious place in the world amongst the most religious people brother Daniel right amen brought him down shame on the Pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the son of God cast ourselves down how many times is God how many times has Satan trying to get us to do things like that put on a show for him right Friday man cast ourselves down don't you know he's giving him scripts Satan tries to manipulate us to the scripture he manipulates words he'll quote the message to you he'll misplace it right right yeah misinterpreted but the word of God I'm glad that the prophet made it so simple and the Bible says it's so simple the word of God was that is without right interpretation he don't take none of the big theologians around the message he don't take another great preachers around the message right all it takes is a heart Desiring to understand God and God said I will send you the comforter and he will lead you in God that's right I'm so thankful for that Comfort this morning I'm thankful for the pastors I'm thankful for the advances the teachers the powerful Ministry because she has been sent to perfect that's right amen the ministry in her the ministry of Jesus Christ that's right oh I'm thankful for that he said and in their hands what about they're talking about the anger he said and in their hands they shall bear the yep lease it anytime thou Dash thy foot against the stone right see that's true the Bible said that God encamps angels around those who fear and love him right Jake was used in the scripture but he was displacing it trying to make him respond the wrong way the same way he does to me and you right right A lot of times we sit in services and somebody will say something that we that a lot of times that we maybe not the way that the pastor says or maybe the other one is the same meaning the same thing but a different approach it's Satan say wait a minute now let brother's off to work but we have to take it back to the scripture that's it right there we try other words Satan God tried Satan's word by the word come on Amen every word he said let every man's word yeah be alive man the truth we try he said try the spirit right if a man gets behind the pulpit and tries to present himself and tries to get you to come to him then he is not a man of God a true man of God will always point you to Jesus Christ under any circumstance I mean in any situation at any time right he'll point you to the word of God all right brother clearly that God he healed himself in such a way that God could use excuse me in this Mighty way amen amen amen he said Jesus always has an answer for them just like the bride has the devil's answer it's just we don't use it right come on come on brother you know what I'm afraid a lot of times is if we don't use you we're gonna lose you yep exactly come on we have to exercise our faith all right what goodness and muscle have you ever seen a man that's a muscle builder a great big muscle but he's got all this a shape and his muscles is off but when he quits muscle building have you ever noticed it and he quits exercising when it goes smooth then he gets what we call Dunlap his stomach has done left over his belt hey man I'm thankful that God God in the spiritual is the same way unless we exercise all right I promises it don't matter if it don't come today if it don't come anymore God said it would come amen amen he said it is said Thou shalt not tempt right the Lord right right then why do we take no right times and we make him jealous because we fail to serve him like we should right right we fail to worship him like we should we pray it failed to pray like we should right we failed to read the books like we should we fail to listen to the message don't you know what makes it you're tempting him right yeah we don't want to make him angry we want us we want to worship him through his love and his grace right yes amen but he's so long suffering with us right I'm thankful of that yeah because we all have sinned and come short of the glory of God all right man we all are falling short but let me tell you I'm holding home to his unchanging hand and it's not the greatest thing that I've got my hand on holding on to him but it's his grip on me that has kept me through this hour right brother he is sustaining power his love has kept me and because he said I will not lose not one of you right amen who can make him who can make him disobey his word right who can make God a liar for he is nothing but true amen I like what uh John said in first John 2 14-18 he says I have written unto you fathers yeah right because you have known him all right I believe there's a lot of Truth by the way there's a lot of people don't really know him right oh my God know him come on brother have a relationship with him B go get to that little room right and become consummated right impregnated with him right exactly Lord Lord on that day yeah I didn't know we do this did we not cast that there was did we not do those things did we're not here let's see in your name yes you did but you never had a born-again experience that's right the prophet I said you can have the Holy Ghost from the Flesh and in your spirit every day of your life and die go to hell come on but to Overcomer is the only one that's going to be able to overcomes the one that has it in their soul amen he said because you have known him that is from the beginning I have written unto you young men this morning listen young man because you are strong and the word of by word of God abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked right amen that's the only way you're going to overcome this hour is right that God abideth in you his word you and him have become one amen that's the Overcomers commission right you have overcome the wicked one here he walks on me he says love not the treasures are that's where your heart will be this morning is your Treasures here boy I haven't learned God and showed me boy I don't need to put my trust in this financial system of this world right all right but I put my trust in God Amen God has kept me yes God will keep you the same if we'll stay true to his word amen stay true to his his message he said neither love the things that are in the world if any man love the world if you love the world more than you love God then you don't have the true love of God right you still have heliola right the old natural affection the love that when somebody would say anything to your wife you're killing me yeah but adopola would pray for that man see it takes the life of God to overcome in this age we're not going to overcome through our knowledge to our understanding but through the power of the Holy Ghost all right all right he said for all that is in the world he has shown us the three greatest Devils that mankind has to overcome he said the lust of the flesh right that's right the lust of the eyes and the pride of life see Jesus Satan cried on that last attempt to get him to get the key to keep his pride they'll be proud you'll be a proud man if you'll do these things yeah yeah and you know what I love this message now love Jesus I'm so glad that when God when God gives a man Revelation brother Wade when God gives a man a revelation that's right but when a man gets his own Revelations right it humbles me that God would show us these times and give us the equipment to defeat the Devil right on his own ground this is his right now right but we're going to overcome right by the word of Our Testimony and the blood of the Lamb all right so you confess your whatever you have need your confessions and God that's right look Joshua killed you know how this is going to win that man Joshua can't really know how that's going to take that City Polo Jackson here come back in line preachers there yeah see that's my strong Running Man a lot of people a lot of ministers are live when you don't preach the truth it's alive there's either truth or a slide it's either it's in the word of God or Satan's life he didn't say what the word says or you're saying are you lying that's right it's that plain Paul said about preach any of the Gospel has been preached and an angel anyone any minister right Peter myself my mom said to be cursed right right for the Bible wants to send Revelation if a man answer your take away from this word right all the plays and everything in there brother people don't fear God come on they get up and say any old things trying to work on their emotions we're not here to get your emotions stirred we're here to get you soul on fire right that's right would it give me a flame of fire when the enemy comes see what skin you know what keeps that old line away the brother God said we'll get the line away in the jungle he wasn't scared of the man's Island he ain't scared of Mind of your theology he scared the fire of God all right brother oh he said in the world passes away in the lust thereof but he I like that that doeth the will of God abideth right forever forever amen his will is his word it's his testimony the will of God is his word she just says Satan you know God he's he's a Triune being he still works in threes right Satan Works in threes to the Holy Trinity he just said okay okay I'm gonna save them amen I'm going to see what I'm going to do is I'm going to let him baptize in the name of the Father the Son the Holy Ghost because that's what Jesus said that's what they always say that's what Jesus said I said but the apostles went out with the commission and knew exactly because they had Revelation they knew exactly what he meant that's right amen I said he's hit it from the watch and The Prudent and reveal it to babes like me we'll be just thankful amen well he's revealed and the rebuild the godhead too but one God he said here to your Israel I am the Lord thy God one all right didn't Jesus say father I thank you that is me and you the one yep I pray that they'll be one right amen God we gotta become one with the word one with the word amen one with the message amen and here's Satan's trying to attack on the word here's what he tries to do to defeat us he wants to overcome us but he can't if we're standing on the work the only reason he was defeated because she stepped out this word is a protection it's a barrier it's a fortification it's a city of refugees amen that your rights can run in that ceiling come on let me find blame Glory come on oh my God and David said blessed is the man who God won't even saying to me you want him because it's not minding your righteousness it's the very righteousness of God Amen Prophet God tells us three musts we must not do yeah misinterpret the word he says for illustration it means well I believe it means this but the word says it means just what it says God don't clamorable words like me and he'll he don't he don't mince rise right right that's why he said let you yay be yeah he says don't misplace the word see Satan is trying to get us either to misinterpret misplace it or must not dislocate the word right do misplace the word right every scripture and the Bible has the same application you have to set it in this place right amen and the only way you accept those debate and the only way God is going to set those scriptures in place and guess the devil was because he was the word oh yeah the only way we can set Satan in his place is we got to become the worship dislocate the word to dislocate the word or mislocate it got it to be it's got to be in the right time the right place at the right moment s man we cannot take Luther's message and take a Rapture exactly it's good and we cannot take away from Luther's message neither can we add two losers neither can we add two Wesley's message neither can we take away from it we have a three step two yeah we have three sets we had to be just the case of sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the Holy Ghost himself right has come when the Holy Ghost yourself come he leads us and God Amen that's right he's the one a lot of people say oh well that was when brother said those things that was for back then oh my the Bible tells me that in the book of in the Book of Malachi he says I am the Lord thy God and I changed not all right neither does his his word changed that's right right I'm gonna say wait a minute now my brother said that I was just and people say oh this is we gotta have a new age gosh oh my God but the Bible tells me and you to be weary of that he said be not conformed to this world but be he transformed by the renewing of your let this mind that was in Christ being used amen we got to think like God right we gotta talk like God we got to live like God we gotta walk like God right and then Satan has no power else right right you don't say he can't tempt us didn't say couldn't temperature say we wouldn't have trials but we'll overcome amen amen will overcome you want to get help from overcome I like what Jesus said in Saint John chapter 16 verse 33 oh I love the word I always like the word the word is true I mean we can't we can't have we can't say that but when the word just says it's true right we might misinterpret it we might miss pronounce it or say something one time but this word when you read it he said these things have I spoken unto you he's speaking to us this morning right right he said that in me you might have peace right hey he made it he went into the bushm of Abraham right but he clinged to his riches the old rich man did while the whole beggar clinged to the word of God exactly right you gain the whole world Lose Yourself what have you got he said that in me you might have peace amen not in your drugs not any alcohol none of those strange ones I've done those things I never found peace right I found a substitute right I was thirsting for God and God say try to replace it with other things but boy wants brother Joel that peace come oh my the piece that surpasses oh I understand I said oh my you can't roll it up you can't pop it you can't drink it you just believe it and receive it that's right that's good all right bro he said in the world you have tribulation he didn't promise us a Bed of Roses every bit of roaches has thorns yeah right amen this Thorn is our flesh right he said but be a good cheer this morning right right bride of Jesus Christ he said I have overcome the world and if we're in him we'll overcome all sir all right come on he said because I have overcome ye shall overclass because I am living in you now yes sir amen I like what Paul said he caught that Revelation he said he causes me to triumphant he calls me to win this battle all right he gave me the ability to stand on God's word oh he velcroed my feet to the truth exactly unmovable unbelievable all right Mom and I am when we see everybody brother almost so many people falling away from the truth I said you need some spiritual velcro you to this rock oh Jesus amen amen amen listen move over one right I said why do you want to stand on Sand right right because sand and sinking Yep this world is sinking the God's word forever amen oh I'm thankful for that all right I like what a Larry toes were said he said we must face today as children of tomorrow we must meet the uncertainties of this world with certainty of the world to come to up your heart right you know what I think a lot of times when we come to church is what I promise is because Jesus said in the Beatitudes it just I've read this over and over and it's the simple little things maybe you call it and maybe but I was reading that he said blessed blessed are the pure in heart but they shall see God we shouldn't come to any service and not see God all right I say God when we get void here we should be Prince of God purify my heart and I might seek God manifested in each and every one of us all right amen right oh I like about this oh Rabbi I once said he was a teacher teaching these young children he said he said how can you tell when the darkness is moving away the light is approaching he says that it's because that you can see the difference between a sheep and a dog in the distance and the class looked at him with him but he said he said no it's not it's not it's not it he said well is it that when the light is coming to the darkness is moving away that you can tell the difference between a peach tree and a fig tree yes that's it he said no that's not last night and they said well what is it he said the way you can tell that the light has removed the darkness is is when you can look and any man or any woman's face yeah and see your brother and sister oh man now that's when the darkness is gone and we look at one another right right my God looks ass you're still looking at Through The Eyes of Flesh look Through The Eyes Of God Amen I'm not looking at this man right he'll never be that mother our tongue gets us in more trouble than anything we speak things and Satan says all right you've signed a contract yeah I'm like oh ah because we spoke it a lot of times when they did and he said oh you're signed right here oh here's your name oh you're confessed it was yours it's yours right right yeah but if we say by his stripes right all right yeah I'm sealed oh my if we can just get that Revelation that God is greater that lives in us than anything that's in this world right amen he said he didn't he said Lord when Jesus prays to your father I pray that you're not taken from this world right right but that you keep them yeah oh my because he wants you to be alive right he wants you to be a testimony right and a true witness right he wants you to be able to shine your light see this world is dying because of Darkness all right they need the light that it shined on us to shine on them right yeah and we don't never know when we might come in come in contact with that that man see on that last one that has backslidden or fell away right and it's a true scene and it might be the problem son or daughter sure are you going to be Jesus to them the world's looking for a Jesus that's right right who's going to be Jesus when you are we're gonna be a little Messiah Overcomers right overcome what the world and the things of this man that's right the lust of the flesh the Lesser that has the pride you know what pride is an awful hard demon to overcome oh yeah you know what I the Lord he he puts us through trials sure how's it working this guy who he was saying things that wasn't in the word you know and so I got in the flesh preachers get in the flesh oh yes oh yes and I told him I said this is what the word says I told him the truth yes but I had the wrong attitude right I walked off he said you told him right but you had the wrong message what are you talking about well I had to swallow that Pride whenever I said and I'm sorry when you talk about humbling man yeah he looked at me so sorry he said what do you mean sir I said I'm sorry because I did tell you the truth but I had the wrong spirit will you forget right right see sometimes we can have the right yeah right you have the right Doctrine oh yeah right the right words right the right the right motive you have the wrong Spirit right right amen amen he said Running Man be off in this Doctrine and writing experience because the spirit of God will change a man's daughter right that's right he said God always give me the right spirit all right amen the devil said we just gotta laughing so so they laughed at Jesus you know what it is God's trying to kill this man right don't worry he'll die and be led by the spirit of God instead of trying to do his own will right and he'd be like Jesus say Jesus the cross didn't kill him right he was already dead right he was a dead man I like to call it a dead man walking right he was dead to his will and he was so in tune to the will of God right that he walked unconscious to things around right now oh God help us get to that place all right the word of the Walk unconscious to criticism all these things these words that people say and things that people do who only just said praise God all right Lord I'm going to glorify brother I said remember when they told that man told brother I said did you hear what that brother said about you he said oh brother that was ordained before the foundation of the world for him to say that about me oh man what yeah you said well that's it for the prophet no well amen amen to the pride of Jesus Christ amen amen he was the Lord let the prophet live that life too since the way that mean you might have just like Jesus when he lived on this other we might have a blueprint to go by right yeah don't don't feed him anytime that's right there was this man I'll go back to brother Prairie Grant but then my cousin mine there was a man I worked with and I was he was done everything he's done everything to try at least I love to try to get the devil on that one he said I'd do everything to make him mad cause I love the torment it might beginners the Lord it with me I can't do this stuff brother you can't we can't do those things this won't be impersonated let's start a prayer will not be impersonated that's right you've been a pure love of God right now Satan can't impersonate love that's right that's why I started doing good things too I'd buy his lunch bringing Gatorade these they said he said you're not gonna get to heaven about doing good to me so I'm not trying to do good to you I'm trying to obey the word and he told the fire he recognized it yeah right and that didn't even seen it you're not going to do to Heaven that way so I'm not trying to go to him that way I'm just trying to obey the word all right man no you know what a minute after a while you know what the Lord removed him no longer sure does he work there anymore right I'm not George Johnson in there that's right but the Lord said he'd make your enemies amen you've done everything he could that's right my God's grace it's not me brothers and sisters by God's grace I'm the last man standing amen he kept me in that hour he said if you'll keep the right energy right the right motive you'll overcome these things it'll be a testimony right to others right that I have overcome right through you it's not me it's not you that overcomes but it's him we just have to yield ourselves to him right right when you do good it just terrible the devil can't stand it oh wait and see we're not here to defend ourselves right he said vengeance is mine said one time he said that God don't forget right when you do so to his children he don't forget oh he writes it down right he's took notice of it witness the people you want to witness to the right attitude and you overcome things and you have to overcome it's just God is overcoming this woman one time she asked me this question like this young Chris asked me I didn't I mean it takes God to show us this Bible right I'm still a baby when it comes to him to the message I want to be growing up one of these I believe I'm growing in the scrubs day by day but she said I want to ask you two questions see they was my friends out in the world and anyone said I want to ask you some questions about the word you know because then the Lord you've got to hold him and change them for what it was that's going to what they call one of these charismatic churches I don't mind so I thought well okay let me ask you some questions you know they said well man he he knows that word let's ask him something so she said well I want to ask you something is it uh what do you think about deaconesses those are tough questions she said well what about women preachers oh my I said well if you ask me again I really know you want to know and I'm obligated to tell you the truth and you may not like it but I want to tell you brother Sammy man the power of God come down there by the way amen love yeah love tell me all right I said hold my I fell in love with him right let me get open that scripture and that scripture just fell that power just fell up I said show me and it wasn't me he took over right he said he said I should show the one priest in the Bible that was there with a woman that handled the fire of God I said show me one apostle that was a woman that was there because she said what about Mary Magdalene went to the party I said she went and told she never preached what about Phillips daughters I said they prophesied she said don't prophesy me preach I said she prophesied I said look at Timothy it says the Bible Paul told us that I worship not a woman to preach or teach or have authority over the man but to be silent exactly it's hard things I can feel it boiling the demon was getting mad so am I but look at this she said what about addiction this I didn't know these things brother don't I didn't know these things he said then ask her how can she be the husband of one wife all right ask the woman how can she be the husband of one wife man happening at that time the Holy Ghost she said what you are you're a male shoving this pig all right so I'm sorry you feel that way and the love of God was only so strong oh my God you know what I'm gonna need because she said here talking to myself I don't even talk to you no more when you speak to you no more I can't believe you believe stuff like that he said well that's the way our pastor teaches us I said oh my God oh my God to jump off a cliff you can fly would you do it he said no I wouldn't I said well he tells you to disbelieve the word of God you're doing the same thing especially you're committing spiritual suicide hung the phone up I could tell there was tension I was talking to him you know what happened I didn't criticize him I didn't get mad the Lord said man I'm spear for their life right because it's a dangerous thing that's right he challenged the word of God Amen remember what happened to Satan when he challenged him the spirit of the Lord moved on me brother Aaron I'm beginning to cry ah RC right Lord forgive them well they don't know what they do all right forget them Lord right Lord have mercy on them why shouldn't we as always say a lot of times I've heard people say I pray that God will destroy them when this Apostles come in he said Lord shall we call for our land he says whoa wait a minute you don't even know what spiritual that's why a lot of us he has not give us the power yet to operate all right brother amen we must come to that place all right total obedience to every word of God right and we need to pray God have mercy Mercy have mercy on me Lord have mercy on them Lord did I say it the wrong way did I do anything wrong Lord father did I provoke them yeah and we can take this message this message is like a atomic bomb brother when you take this message we can blow people slap up right destroy them yeah all right this message is also a city amen all right this message is also a message of Grace exactly this message is not there was not sent to destroy come on with his sent to bring those that are called for his purpose right amen they might be Sons and Daughters of God we don't know who they are a lot of times we roll up our notes and say look at that old prostitute right right you know what I went and visited a man one time he had a mental breakdown young man this is where the Lord wants me to go just let him have his way this morning and I went to visit this man in the Lord he teaches us I mean he's a great tutor the great teacher I went to see him and he was a real friend of mine he had a mental bread now just the Lord had just got a hold of me I walked into that place and he had a breakdown he was oh it was horrible to see a man destroyed you know I walked in there I looked at him know what the holy spirit said that would have been you you had you not come right oh my God right brother thank you foreign I said oh god oh Lord restore his man right follow restoration right Heaven Lord and even he did even even I mean the Lord spoke to me then when I spoke to him he said you know he said you know brother Richard he said this could be you instead of me yeah I said oh my God I'm out of the two or three Witnesses oh God I did not bear for Grace but nothing for Mercy we didn't ever get off the ship we'd have been Shipwrecked if it hadn't been for the message the word of God on that ship when Paul was there yeah right yeah right and he said don't feed her the same Angel of the Lord serve and worship 20. no whatever yeah oh my God the holy ghost that spoke to us no one else shall be lost if they just obey the prophets listen that's why we see so many people around the message brother deal shipwreck life destruction on the bank you're tore up in the Rocks right it's because he didn't obey what the prophet said right right the prophet said don't go there'll be much much hurt and the property guys screamed stay in line little bride you're staying alive a lot of times we go all right and we find ourselves shipwreck because we disobeyed memories oh God right help us help us father to be Obed to your word yes sir your mind if I race and the church age I want to talk about that Throne just for a minute oh the overcoming strong Revelations 3 21 he said to him that overcometh well I grant you set with me in my Throne all right thank you Jesus even as I also overcome and I'm sat down with my father in history what an opportunity that we we us the iPhone the outcasts of the world will set with the King yeah right he said now what are we to overcome he said that's the normal question to ask here that's a normal question oh I appreciate the simplest of the world don't you he said but it's not the actual thought of this verse right for it is not so much what we are to overcome yeah but how we ought to overcome now this is a logical now this is logical for does it matter what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcast oh my there's a difference see when a Fighter fights a fight if he knows how to defeat that upon he's studied him he'll know what he can what punch you can't take and what punch you can't take right you know if he can't take the body blows see he said a quick look at the scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition in Matthew 4 wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal Temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only in each of the three major trials that corresponded flesh unless they said corresponded exactly to the temptation of the Garden of Eden he said the lust of the he said the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye the pride of life Jesus overcome by the word eve fail to the person of Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word right right he said in Adam fell in indirect indirect Disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say that this is the only way to being overcomer also is the only way that you can know if you're overcoming because that word Can't Fail right oh my heaven exactly that's why that word has to be in like David said he still have a hidden thou word in my heart and I said nothing because he knew David's flesh would pass away all those things but he knew that word of God about it forever he said now notice again Jesus overcame the three World Systems of religion we're going to overcome overcome three World Systems in relationship how will you overcome by the word exactly people say well I wait till the program and I get serious yeah it's a dangerous thing right you might find yourself hunting for all right because outside in the door locked right yeah it says in he said when we repeatedly when he was repeatedly badgered by the theologians of this day we got a lot of theolograms around the message imagine the truth you stand on the truth or not very well like fella but that's all right I don't mind being Jesus's Oddball I like being called Jesus's donkey yeah that's right amen he said he constantly applied the word he spoke only what the father gave him to speak oh my that's where we get in trouble right he said he only spoke what the father do right yep he says there was not a Time when the world was not utterly confused by his wisdom oh yeah see this message confuses people but God's Not the Only confusion but of life eternal amen he said for the wisdom wisdom he said confused was not really confused by his wisdom for it was the wisdom of God when is not the wisdom of God confounded the wise and the Prudence right he said in his own personal life contending with himself Jesus contending with himself his flesh he overcame by obedience to the word of God he said in Hebrews 5 7 it says who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death that's what's going to save us from death amen and the same thing that saved him and was heard and that he feared Jesus feet and be feared oh my because no man every man always feared death because he didn't know what to expect he said he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect will even not be made perfect through our sufferings and our trials if we don't have no trials and suffering you know what character character is not a gift it's a victory all right he said he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them how will he become the author of Eternal salvation of Me and You by us following the word and obeying everywhere he was obedient to the word he said now then there's not one person I like this part by the deal I know you've read it many times it's just now then there will not be one person who will sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been living that word right right back and you say just hearing that right amen he said living that word amen he said your prayers boy this is powerful by the way your prayers your fastings your repentances no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that Throne it will be granted only as the Throne of the king is shared by the queen because she is United to him United here right yeah he said so only they who are of that word even as he is of that word we'll share that Throne he said remember we have shown clearly All Through the Ages ages that even and fail because they met the word so the Ephesian age fell by turning slightly from the word he said until with every age continue to turn we have final repetition of the word by the World Council Church systems this layout of seeing age ends in the blackout of the word thereby causing the departure of the Lord from yes the only age that departure of the Lord has ever left in the midst of this this the church happens right oh my not the pardon from us right but from the church world he says he stands outside calling to his own who follow him by obedience to the word after a short and Powerful demonstration of the spirit this little Hunted hunted right persecuted group will go to be with Jesus yes sir amen that's the only way the only way we're ever going to overcome is overcome the reborn again expense with God let us stand that's right brother amen only ever defeat Satan is we defeat Satan by the word of God Brethren said in the future home of the of the future home with the bride he said Overcomers have overcome the Beast his Mark of his name he said and we are feeding off the tree of life the only way
