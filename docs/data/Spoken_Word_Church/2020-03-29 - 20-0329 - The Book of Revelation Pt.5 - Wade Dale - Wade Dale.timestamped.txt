[0:01] okay all right good to be a house Lord
[0:08] today take the beam with all of you here
[0:12] practicing social distancing but I hope
[0:19] you weren't distant from the Lord of
[0:20] this week I don't we all have a little
[0:22] quiet town with the Lord indeed these
[0:27] got hold picture puzzle that 500,000
[0:34] piece puzzle together get to know each
[0:46] other a little bit better maybe also did
[0:48] some money but good it'd be enough for
[0:52] today we're going to begin or continue
[0:53] our series on the book of Revelation so
[1:00] I hadn't thought about doing it but
[1:02] about three or four I get every question
[1:04] that we do it so will how I feel it
[1:06] anyway so let's start with revelations
[1:09] three I think we got here to the church
[1:11] and Sardis which is the turntable Martin
[1:15] Luther says unto the Angel of the Church
[1:19] of Sardis write these things that he
[1:21] doesn't have to seven spirits of God and
[1:22] the Seven Stars I know that works the
[1:25] time I've been named it they live it and
[1:27] are dead and we know what that is even
[1:31] in that started easy in church age they
[1:35] were still baptized in the name of the
[1:36] Father Son Holy Ghost and now that's a
[1:39] name that that liveth and I'm dead now
[1:42] that's coming out of the Dark Ages
[1:43] coming out of the time of Columba that
[1:46] we were talking about think
[1:48] any to Martin Luther headed toward the
[1:51] Reformation which started really a
[1:54] restoration but they were under
[1:56] Reformation because of this right here
[1:58] you're not to reform mister just to get
[2:01] people to come back and under
[2:02] justification get the people to come
[2:04] back to God and coming back to God and
[2:08] God allowed even them to baptize in the
[2:11] name of Father Son Holy Ghost give them
[2:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost because
[2:14] that would be only like they had they
[2:18] didn't have the light remember the light
[2:20] of the name of Lord Jesus Christ was
[2:22] buried in the Dark Ages by the Catholic
[2:26] Church by the 325 AD in 606 AD when they
[2:32] come together saying that Jesus was a
[2:35] life sentence of God not do something do
[2:37] something some done so they split him up
[2:39] into three God the Father God the Son
[2:42] God the Holy Ghost but now we know he's
[2:43] one person just like we are one person
[2:46] I'm my name though this one I'm one
[2:51] person I'm a father
[2:53] then when my dad comes up to me I become
[2:57] a son at that time because I'm the son
[2:58] I'm saying the Bell but then also when
[3:01] Josh walks up to me I become a father
[3:03] and then when Deana my grandbaby walks
[3:06] up to me I'm with my title my person
[3:08] doesn't change but my title changes the
[3:11] grandpa all right it's that pretty
[3:14] simple that God is not three different
[3:17] personalities which have to talk to each
[3:20] other to get an opinion of what's going
[3:23] on though it's one mine
[3:24] one Lord Jesus Christ who is God
[3:27] Almighty now we know there's positions
[3:30] because remember when he was on earth
[3:32] the one inside of him was the father
[3:35] okay but remember you can't then though
[3:39] when Jesus said I'll go away and I'll
[3:42] send you another comforter but now jesus
[3:43] said I'll come back so it's not a
[3:46] different you know there was the Holy
[3:48] Ghost waiting up there in heaven until
[3:50] the day of Pentecost no the Holy Ghost
[3:51] was in
[3:52] welcome Jordan Galilee if not anyone god
[3:56] he was the fullness of the Godhead
[3:58] bottom right being that he was as John
[4:05] one says the word was made flesh and
[4:09] blood among us then he transferred that
[4:12] now we know Jesus the flesh is not here
[4:15] truly he is in another dimension but
[4:17] it's not another God that he sent or
[4:20] another person that he sent because you
[4:25] know as well as I've been God being
[4:29] perfect being infinite these that matter
[4:32] three people are just as equal as they
[4:35] can be we are different personality so
[4:37] we would have somewhere in our life we'd
[4:39] have a conflict even though we're in
[4:41] harmony with God and all that somewhere
[4:44] because Bob would not go settle in the
[4:46] beer stand hey zero degrees and deer
[4:50] hunt and he says that's right but now
[4:52] being brother Danny fountain we've done
[4:54] it and we'll continue to do it when we
[4:56] can so there we have a conflict but
[4:59] that's a personality because a person is
[5:01] different that's why you can't say God
[5:03] in three persons in case somebody's
[5:05] watching in that art that has the trendy
[5:10] doctrine and even Martin Luther still
[5:12] had it but God went to take this from
[5:14] Martin Luther because all he all he was
[5:16] commissioned to do was right here
[5:19] strengthen the things we've remained
[5:21] that the ready to die for I've not found
[5:23] thy works perfect before God want father
[5:25] son Holy Ghost is not a perfect acted
[5:28] under permissive will it was okay
[5:30] because they didn't have light for that
[5:32] day okay so there's no three
[5:36] personalities of God you know even even
[5:40] though their denomination say well Jesus
[5:42] was God well how was he got well he was
[5:45] the second person of the Trinity when
[5:47] you bring that word person in you bought
[5:49] you that you separated and God's not
[5:52] confusing he's not the arthur confusion
[5:56] he's not confused and he's not confused
[5:58] the Holy Ghost
[5:59] long ago what do you mean by that no
[6:01] it's the same person so he he's the same
[6:04] person but there is a flesh died in
[6:07] another dimension because that flesh had
[6:09] to go away so he could send the Holy
[6:12] Spirit so that he could because remember
[6:14] when he was here on earth in a human
[6:15] body he could not go into the believer
[6:19] because he was the corn wheat that had
[6:22] to die and when he come up all this
[6:26] happened come up now on the resurrection
[6:29] day 120 little Jesus's that we spoke
[6:31] before then 3,000 of Jesus's and then we
[6:34] got little Jesus is sitting here today
[6:36] all because that one God died in human
[6:41] flesh took the flesh into another
[6:44] dimension
[6:45] to wait on the works to be done through
[6:47] the believers that's the way I see it
[6:49] it's just this it's not to be done
[6:52] through a book or a tape it's really not
[6:55] it's to be done to human believers
[6:57] that's the way he said that
[6:59] and the Word was made flesh today the
[7:04] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[7:06] we are the word made manifest in human
[7:08] flesh
[7:11] the only difference we are is is we are
[7:13] different personalities but now when it
[7:16] comes to the Word of God me and brother
[7:18] Bob brother Danny brother Ryan yeah I
[7:21] can't play their own board nothing not
[7:23] even one can be to stick together but
[7:26] brother Ryan can see that's what we
[7:27] would be personality differences he'd
[7:29] like me to connect form I didn't but
[7:31] exactly have different things that he
[7:33] that he likes that I don't that's pretty
[7:34] but when we come and talk about the Word
[7:36] of God then that's when we all connect
[7:38] back together because your soul the real
[7:41] you that's been born again does it think
[7:47] I can use it right right he doesn't
[7:51] think like it used to these been
[7:53] transformed deposited by the renewing of
[7:55] our mind
[7:57] person of the Holy Ghost is now residing
[7:59] in you we just got online in human flesh
[8:02] right here that's where people know that
[8:05] you know a lot of a lot of denominations
[8:07] going have a problem with Jesus dying
[8:09] for the sins 2,000 years ago but to put
[8:12] that actual person not the flesh but the
[8:14] Holy Ghost that was released
[8:16] put that back inside of you and you got
[8:18] to act like him that's where you know
[8:20] that's where you have different
[8:21] personalities but remember will tell my
[8:24] doctor when you see doctrine excuse me
[8:28] it's not I'm not sick
[8:31] it's just it's just the allergies that's
[8:33] coming up in the any air being a
[8:36] beekeeper I like this time of the year
[8:38] cuz everything's green and everything's
[8:40] got pollen all over it so that means my
[8:42] bees are working hard and they really
[8:43] are but he knows what the science of
[8:47] granting someone but Martin Luther was
[8:50] commissioned to bring her a cup Tallis
[8:53] ISM that was dark in the dark ages they
[8:57] were killing Christian six and a half
[8:58] million I killed little Christian trying
[9:03] to get them to convert to that person of
[9:05] a God where the little minority of the
[9:08] Christians that took the night we know
[9:10] God we know Jesus Christ his own mind
[9:12] going into place and now he was higher
[9:15] than us kind of churches know he was
[9:18] eyes in the Pope and the Pope and the
[9:20] church at 81 today so Martin Luther
[9:23] brought my lap under Reformation but the
[9:31] Bible says I will restore so God started
[9:33] restoration in a small degree come out
[9:36] of her my people so Martin Luther's grip
[9:38] come out but they were still under a
[9:40] name with no limits and heard and I
[9:42] remember Martin Luther went David the
[9:48] way we think Dave now he had life in him
[9:51] but the rock the false doctrine was
[9:54] David tell then we might many mighty
[9:58] works done under Martin Luther John
[9:59] Wesley disappoint well if the Holy Ghost
[10:02] wasn't there when the whole
[10:04] one inside of them but the way I this is
[10:07] just the way I see it the Holy Ghost is
[10:10] the same Holy Ghost means you had but
[10:11] when Martin Luther would take somebody
[10:14] in baptize with nail polish on Holy
[10:16] Ghost that inside man had to be
[10:19] struggling with this is not right but he
[10:23] didn't know how to handle that and there
[10:25] wasn't enough word remember the Bible
[10:27] became written during this time - during
[10:30] this time here this is what the Bible
[10:33] was compiled together and put in a book
[10:35] we call a Bible
[10:36] so really Martin Luther started to learn
[10:40] a little bit about the Bible what I'm
[10:42] saying is acts 2:38 wasn't revealed to
[10:45] me it was being compiled in the Bible
[10:47] but acts 2:38 wasn't revealed Martin
[10:50] couldn't when time God went to digging
[10:53] up some man he started with two shoes he
[10:55] had started with the tree he's starting
[10:57] with the two shoes but there was a laugh
[10:59] than those two shoe not the light went
[11:01] out of the two suits and went into the
[11:03] stop but it doesn't make the chute you
[11:05] can't go out there today and start
[11:07] taking corn and there's only two sheep
[11:08] sticking up about this high now
[11:10] potentially this corn potentially it has
[11:13] to pull this of the baptism of the holy
[11:15] go during the Martin Luther day
[11:16] potentially but you got away go ahead
[11:20] wait until the light came out of this
[11:22] got enough sunlight photosynthesis
[11:26] started working in dental oh shoot
[11:27] started coming out called John Wesley
[11:30] and that come out with the stop you got
[11:32] to have a stop to put a piece of corn on
[11:34] the end up mm-hmm so it's all important
[11:38] be watchful and strengthen those things
[11:41] which remain in other words Martin
[11:44] Luther looked at the Catholic Church and
[11:46] says there's some things that I do
[11:48] approve up now they have some things
[11:50] they do believe Jesus was gone but they
[11:52] just believed he's another
[11:53] Trent they don't deny that we see then
[11:56] they had an Mary in there and all these
[11:59] different things and they add to the
[12:00] word hmm but the word was never not a
[12:05] strength because when Martin Luther
[12:06] ready to just show them my faith that
[12:09] clicked a lot on and he said hey we
[12:13] don't have to do penance anymore we
[12:15] don't have to drag ourselves through the
[12:16] streets or flack to let ourselves you
[12:18] know with the whips like they do you
[12:20] watch over in the Philippines I was
[12:21] watching them a YouTube video the other
[12:25] day about the Easter service in the
[12:27] different parts of the world well
[12:29] brother they don't went over there when
[12:30] the next up is actually this guy
[12:32] actually gets nailed to the cross and
[12:34] people have a parade and they put have a
[12:37] will and they put little hooks on the
[12:39] end of it and you'll watch them I mean
[12:41] there's flame blood it's just ready to
[12:42] the table they're just waiting blood
[12:44] everywhere that laying down on the
[12:45] ground but they're Catholic they're
[12:48] trying to get rid of their sin my works
[12:51] Martin Luther City
[12:53] not a word it's a faith the just shall
[12:56] live by faith if you've been justified
[12:59] you've got to be living by bags like
[13:02] we've been talking about with Abraham
[13:04] all right be watchful and strengthen the
[13:08] things which remain that are ready to
[13:10] die rather not found thy works perfect
[13:12] before God or that word would be
[13:16] complete because they weren't complete
[13:18] you can't you can't take a baptism and
[13:23] then father son Holy Ghost to the
[13:24] headstone right somewheres had to be
[13:26] done away with because remember Jesus
[13:28] was to headstone and whatever he taught
[13:31] that's why it's gotta come back to it
[13:33] that's fine that this prophet and the
[13:35] end time had to restore that back to the
[13:38] faith of the Father
[13:41] remember therefore how thou has received
[13:43] and heard and hold fast and repent how'd
[13:47] they hear Martin Luther comes up at the
[13:49] end of the Catholic age Martin Luther
[13:50] come
[13:50] I start preaching the just shall live by
[13:52] faith he puts the 95 theses on the door
[13:54] said this is what I don't agree with the
[13:56] Catholic Church Czech Catholic Church
[13:58] mm-hmm as we said before I hope we
[14:01] understand this that the reason
[14:05] Protestantism came to be was because
[14:08] they were protesting
[14:10] that's what Protestant main protest they
[14:13] were protesting the Catholic Church cuz
[14:15] then you've got Catholics and you've got
[14:17] Protestants well it's now until this day
[14:20] but remember the model says it all wines
[14:23] right back up into the catholicism so
[14:25] the daughter's the harlot daughters are
[14:30] going to finally agree with the mother
[14:31] and they're gonna go right back in and
[14:34] that's why we'll go to that seven
[14:35] churches a little bit later and we see
[14:37] they leave their first love for sure and
[14:40] they go back to what the old mother that
[14:42] started down here before church age and
[14:45] they'll all bow to Catholic Church
[14:49] finally saw the Pope moving around
[14:51] yesterday he's gonna see any understand
[14:54] we see so he's not sick as they
[15:00] presented it yes but I'm sure he blocked
[15:02] tight in the Vatican they're they're
[15:04] dying by the thousands in Italy so I'm
[15:07] sure he's uh distancing himself because
[15:11] he's their Vicar he's their Cardinal
[15:13] hurt I guess to keep that well he died
[15:16] what happened this need a vote another
[15:17] guy hand and then God just moves from
[15:19] that vessel into this mess it's all
[15:24] built on tradition and all religions so
[15:27] but now listen there's good people and
[15:29] all of them there's some devout
[15:30] Catholics that would make us look back
[15:32] go to church every Mass every Sunday
[15:34] morning there they go every day and
[15:36] thank Matt there's man this kind of
[15:38] Turkey every day so they go take the
[15:40] weight from them and the Eucharist and
[15:42] all the different things and they're
[15:44] from really devout Catholics and let God
[15:46] judge them but the ones that are going
[15:48] to be really judged by God is ones in
[15:51] the hierarchy thick
[15:53] down the terror on the people after we
[15:55] leave
[15:57] you see these things working now where
[16:00] our governments coming up with all this
[16:02] money and I keep thinking that there was
[16:05] may have been called in the Vatican but
[16:07] hey can you back this because you know
[16:10] Wow all he's got to do it say yeah or no
[16:12] and then we shift our leisure to
[16:16] childhood but that's the way it's both
[16:18] in we know that we read tomorrow's news
[16:22] today I don't think this virus is the
[16:26] end of the world but it does put things
[16:29] in motion let's see how now we're
[16:31] meeting now the whole day to shut the
[16:33] place down and so you can't get it over
[16:35] more than 10 feet right so here we go
[16:38] which is fine I'm not scattered I'm
[16:40] cautious we need all be cautious to help
[16:43] be scared and don't have any fear I
[16:45] don't have any fear about any of that
[16:47] hey I look I'm a postal worker I took
[16:50] thousands of pieces of mail and I touch
[16:54] 650 mailboxes every day so I'm fine but
[17:01] let's don't be foolish I was reading I'm
[17:03] gonna try to pull it up read it this
[17:05] afternoon but there was a lady center
[17:07] Facebook posted I believe in God but I
[17:10] don't reach in the oven and get them and
[17:12] get the pan out without followers I
[17:14] don't get in the car without gas and was
[17:17] seatbelt you know I don't do these
[17:19] things differently now now but now the
[17:22] reverse of that is you say well you got
[17:24] faith will if something happens and you
[17:26] have to put your hand in a fire to help
[17:28] somebody or an emergency and God clear
[17:31] that far away which we've seen it many
[17:33] times
[17:33] we can get stuff spilled oil and all
[17:35] that now that's faith in the believing
[17:38] of God of the healer but let's don't
[17:39] let's not provoke God the Bible says
[17:41] don't provoke me
[17:42] so let's don't let's not provoke God in
[17:45] other words just don't go stand out in
[17:47] the middle that road and wait for a
[17:48] tractor-trailer oil god stop that
[17:50] tractor-trailer well we'll say let's
[17:56] just don't tempt God now maybe if you
[17:58] run out to help somebody like that stop
[18:01] the tractor trailer he did that one June
[18:03] one time well we go get a few minutes
[18:06] where I'm gonna get a whole lot further
[18:07] than that but they've come down money
[18:11] well Mountain her dad whether it's been
[18:13] 10 or 15 years ago car slipped over
[18:16] people were thrown out and you ever be
[18:20] no money a mountain coming down the
[18:22] mountains like this I mean you have to
[18:23] gear way down and it's just like this
[18:25] all the way down so in front of them
[18:29] that was a Hispanic couple husband and
[18:31] wife and baby about it six months is
[18:34] year old something like that we went to
[18:37] make a long story short the baby got
[18:38] thrown out in the middle of a road this
[18:43] the four lanes I think coming down the
[18:45] mountain and here comes all the traffic
[18:49] and here comes a tractor-trailer and
[18:50] June didn't want to move the baby
[18:53] because she didn't what can i Andres you
[18:55] might kill it or dirt if it's broke or
[18:57] back broke so she just stood up like
[18:59] this with her hands right over the
[19:02] baby's car you stood up like this right
[19:04] here with her hand and to make a long
[19:06] story short the tractor-trailer
[19:07] stopped within about ten feet of that
[19:11] baby
[19:12] of course immediately put the brakes on
[19:14] turn flashers on and everybody started
[19:16] going actually he was a shield so when
[19:18] the mercy people got there they that big
[19:21] truck was sitting there and he was the
[19:22] baby him unfortunately I think the baby
[19:24] passed away
[19:25] the state it was alive the gym you know
[19:28] she's not EMT but she took Red Cross
[19:34] you know safety courses and all that
[19:36] stuff when we had to take care so she
[19:37] was certified to administer like a first
[19:41] response medication or not meditation
[19:44] bit come keep it steady and all that
[19:46] stuff anyway I miss you and the guys
[19:49] just you know in 10 feet away didn't
[19:52] jack knob didn't do any of that right
[19:54] down in front of a big stop so we take
[19:57] thoughtful that see now that would be
[19:58] running out in the middle of the road
[20:00] and God preserving and protecting you
[20:02] taking what you do it but let's go probe
[20:04] well tonight and all this please don't
[20:08] provoke good still wash your hands still
[20:10] do the things you're supposed to do and
[20:14] we'll be fine we'll get back together
[20:15] don't worry remember therefore how thou
[20:17] has received and heard and hold fast and
[20:20] repent what they listen to what their
[20:22] messenger said hold fast to it they held
[20:26] fast to Martin Luther's message of the
[20:28] just shall live by faith
[20:30] they repented of their past that's not
[20:33] justification repent on you past sins
[20:36] they repented of their past and they
[20:38] began walking in newness of life now
[20:40] their Holy Ghost it's the same Holy
[20:44] Ghost like I said we had but it's in a
[20:46] very mind even for me it was compressed
[20:49] by there was not enough word for it to
[20:51] fully reveal itself right there my god
[20:54] that the analogy I'll use many times out
[20:57] like they were saying before but but if
[21:00] you do this right here and you focus
[21:02] right on the Bob well I see Bob but now
[21:06] there's brother Danny brother Ryan and
[21:08] Rose likes it here now I've only seen
[21:11] I've only seen Bo Bob why because my eye
[21:16] of faith has been covered over and if I
[21:19] didn't know y'all were in the room I
[21:21] would only think Bob's in a room well
[21:23] that's justification that's what God was
[21:25] happy to look at mark
[21:27] and Martin Luther the look in the Word
[21:28] of God and say the just shall live by
[21:30] faith didn't have a whole lot of
[21:32] revelation at all before all the other
[21:34] things that were revealed
[21:35] well then John Wesley God just open
[21:37] their eyes a little bit more there
[21:39] brother Danny and brother Bob but now I
[21:41] don't see brother Ron I don't see better
[21:42] back then when you come to the baptism
[21:45] the Holy Ghost this more of the word
[21:47] revealed now the focus of the word the
[21:49] seals have been opened the books been
[21:51] opened so we're under an open book
[21:53] that's why we always say that and it's
[21:55] become an icon of story in our in our
[21:59] the way we see things but it's true our
[22:01] eyes our faith has been we went up like
[22:04] the eagle and we can see 360 all the way
[22:07] around we can see further than anybody
[22:09] camp so these great revelations of one
[22:12] God the baptism in the name of Lord
[22:14] Jesus Christ being correct baptism no
[22:15] Trinitarian doctrine that God is one God
[22:18] and Jesus is his name and then we need
[22:22] to to be connected to that family Jesus
[22:24] at baptize in the name of the Father and
[22:26] of the son named wovoka who is that
[22:29] father than our name son huh name Holy
[22:31] Ghost is not a name
[22:32] it's a title just like me when I say my
[22:36] times grandfather now my otoscope
[22:37] grandfather brother died
[22:39] all right so the Martin Luther's church
[22:44] age that God that I saw was the judge
[22:47] show that buffet justification to just
[22:49] and the justifier one person died came
[22:52] on the scene in the baptism of the Holy
[22:54] Ghost baptized them into the family but
[22:56] they only could see this much of the
[22:58] word because it wasn't time that was
[23:01] only two shoots it's not the full grain
[23:03] now the full grain is coming and Martin
[23:06] Luther did his job and went off the
[23:08] scene and then some of them look
[23:12] remember therefore we'll stop right it's
[23:14] down 55 will you ready to go remember
[23:15] therefore how thou has received and
[23:17] heard and hold fast and repent if
[23:20] therefore thou shalt not watch I will
[23:22] come visit thee and thou shalt not know
[23:25] what hour
[23:26] come upon day in other words keep
[23:30] watching because this is not the end
[23:31] yeah there's more to come right that has
[23:35] the few names even in sardis which have
[23:37] not defiled their garments in other
[23:39] words there was they group there they
[23:41] had to work all right and they shall
[23:44] walk with me in white for they are
[23:47] worthy then look we'll talk about
[23:50] healing overcoming next time you it's
[23:52] 9:55 mm to this book there be careful be
[23:56] safe don't do anything stupid
[24:02] wash your hands
[24:04] don't sneeze be sick stay home practice
[24:07] social distancing if you'll do those
[24:09] things I'll guarantee you look this
[24:12] thing it's not it's only airborne when
[24:15] it comes out of my mouth this mouth it's
[24:17] not something that's gonna float around
[24:18] in the air no it's a person-to-person
[24:21] and I hate it when you look out you see
[24:25] it like blaming Trump but if you blame
[24:27] somebody you need to blame yourself call
[24:31] the plays have come upon us well the
[24:34] landing yourself that I'm not right with
[24:35] God enough to where I can go outside and
[24:38] say peace be still
[24:39] hello so know Trump didn't bring it
[24:42] China as a government didn't bring it
[24:45] everybody blaming everybody else I just
[24:47] blame myself but I can't stand outside
[24:49] the day and go Hall County go to the
[24:53] hospital and clear the hospital does he
[24:55] remember it's not a public show so what
[24:58] but individually we can pray we can pray
[25:01] for these people you pray for people
[25:02] because they're individuals and they're
[25:04] humans they're human beings that are
[25:06] dying I was thinking last night
[25:07] every time any diving in Italy if it's
[25:10] not Christians we know what's gonna
[25:13] happen I just pray that people become
[25:16] Christian than that you know there are
[25:18] dead big commission or whatever you want
[25:20] to say but statements once they say
[25:23] we'll get through this I believe that
[25:25] you know I I don't know if it's gonna be
[25:27] done by April but we may have a July 4th
[25:31] Independence knows but just listen be
[25:33] vigilant I still gotta work several of
[25:35] us dinner essential work with Ryan's got
[25:37] to work and don't give you that or not
[25:41] God will provide our needs I promise you
[25:44] you wait he always had the Ali's will
[25:47] brother Damon without work for over a
[25:48] year and God provided his need you know
[25:51] what he done though let me give you a
[25:53] little a little example he took out some
[25:55] long term answer before this happened to
[25:59] take care of all that for brother than
[26:01] anyone willing you see but but he and I
[26:04] believe the Holy Spirit tells you plans
[26:06] to do it not today
[26:08] now we listen sometimes we don't and we
[26:10] we we read both sides so as a Christian
[26:14] I think God's gonna help us he's
[26:15] anybody's and I'll lead you and guide
[26:17] you into all truth let's go up there is
[26:18] going kind of god bless you all
