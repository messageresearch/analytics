========================================

[Music] openly from the eyes of my heart [Music] I want to see a man [Music] shining in the light already loving or else your power and love [Music] we appear [Applause] shining in the latter for outreach power [Music] totally logo [Music] amen and amen amen I think if you take a look around you might find in mind good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn what we've been reading in Jonah 2 and it will go to Ephesians 1 remember all the people that are out with all of the sicknesses and everything is just scattered everywhere and everybody is 6 or that that gives us a point - that puts us to a basics that we need to do a lot of praying you know because I'm just straight as I say it like this you praying for somebody else is good but you know what next week you might need somebody pray for you all right so it's a good point that we need to do a lot of praying and pray one for another for all of these that are sick and all I kept the little one sometimes and this wretched Lord would touch each one remember now the fellowship meeting will be here on the third Saturday in March brother Ernie Villanueva the Lord willing we'll be ministering for us that weekend so we'll keep these things in your prayers the other announcements Terrance's made them and everything so just whatever we have coming up just remember each one and now on to I would ask you to listen to this past Sunday's message now if you have it and don't have an ability to do it on the computer all you got to do is let Richard know it and you make you a copy of a you know of a CD that you can play on yours and things because that was a very timely and relevant Rev relating message to me to her that we could follow in and you will see that where I'm going as it's dropping right in behind it and I'll actually be quoting and coming in to the same things he was Sunday and you know he he kind of got a little bit length these are about two hours of it but we didn't have anything else to do and the services and things and you know and it wouldn't really you know that bad but yet we don't want to take a chance with people coming in and getting hurt and all coming up and going back so we try to do and we try to contact all of you after all we do we're gonna miss one so of what I say to you and they're gonna make up a list trying to get it right is anytime that there's a bad weather condition existing call somebody or go to the to the internet systems that were everybody is to contact everybody see if you'll do that then you'd find out in a hurry that you know which would not and not come on you know and do everything and do it and even I've always been tried to encourage you that even if you do come on may be real careful about it and if you feel in danger don't do it just at home we've got the tapes we can play it and things like that but now that would be a real good when I was reading the thing the other day for a guy the cartoon in the paper and he was telling that you know kind of like the guy that said he couldn't go I couldn't go to work that day because his wife was sick and he's sitting out on the creek bank you know fishing well that's pretty well like a lot of people do you know they'll say well you know we can't go to church may be a good time to go fishing you know but okay just keep it in your mind and keep your thoughts running on that alright let's go - Jonah - and then we'll go to Ephesians one father we thank you for the day in the hour that we have and thank you for your love and your grace unto us that were Father that we can follow into your footsteps and walk in the light of your love we ask you to bless each one Lord we know that brother lluís and his family sick Lord little lilies are sick and the different ones here many here that are sick among us and coughing and everything father we plead the blood of our Lord and Savior and believe in that by your stripes we are healed and we thank you for it and we just commit it into your hands and believe in that you'll take care of everybody and let everything be all right we love you as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name all right we'll you'll see in a moment that we are changing titles not thought the titles so we'll get along with it and and move on to that in a few minutes but let's read this from Jonah because we we've been bringing that thought but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord we don't have to read the next we know what happened God then delivered Jonah all right now let's go to Galatians excuse me Ephesians and start with verse 4 and just read and then when we get to the mess with the part of changing the title you'll see where we wedged in from back here because our title is going to change we've been using the title called salvation alright that meaning deliverance okay now we're going to pick up and the title for a while will be from salvation to Redemption okay so you'll you'll catch the point of what we're doing as we go along and try to give understanding verse 4 according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him and love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins the court to the riches of his grace Corian he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will the prophet said that was to adopt us we'll get into that in a later messages on the adoptions and they having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and look what your Redemption is going from heaven to earth ever all things which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth know after you heard the word of truth Holy Ghost ain't gonna following anybody that ain't heard the word what would it do you got to hear the word first right after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that now notice the statement though that that's why would this not say he'd be sealed with a with the Holy Spirit since we ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise now he tells you what the holy spirit of promise is what is it which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now as I said the other day and I'm truthful in doing it and trying my best to get us to understand and we covered where brother Branham said that there was over 900 different on churches and things you know denominations and and all I gave you the message are a couple of times and he said that that meant there was over 900 different ways of seeing the new birth or the born-again experience of what nine hundred and somethin different ways of seeing one thing that Jesus first message that he preached was you must be born again now the mass confusion then is not centered around the seals the plagues of ours the trumpets the marriage and divorce of things the mass confusion of the day is centered around because honestly come on now it's just think the way I do for a little bit you don't have to worry about the Baptist Methodist and I'm not talking at them but they don't preach the seals the plagues the vials of thunders no and the marriage and divorces and all like that they Pete preach what do they preach now what did brother Brown said about Billy Graham the greatest man that he said ever was it had the message of salvation now he bragged on him he said nobody had it like he had it all right see if you can go out and people even in this message and a lot of you said it we need to know something about salvation well right and now we're getting the opportunity let's see what you do with it let's see what you do with this opportunity of trying to talk about salvation I noticed on the internet kind of tickle to me the my popularity rate you know we can see on there how many hits you get and my popularity rate since I've started in this new birth I told you the deaths and you don't have to preach all those deep things just break up the churches my popularity right check it you that looking in the Internet has went down drastically there's not a lot of people connecting on as a matter of fact the last time I looked at the licenses they wasn't enough on there to be how many people here that do connect on that didn't connect I don't maybe you're getting bored about this that I'm trying to bring what do you understand the situation now I'm trying to express don't worry about to imagine a divorce or seals a thing the denominations are not teaching them what are they teaching what is all basic organizations teaching a form of salvation a new birth a born-again experience a baptism of the Holy Ghost that's that true icon I mean that's the point that I'm getting it that still after all of this time it's your prophet said there's 900 different ways of people saying that I didn't make them state let's see you're gonna have to argue with him about it one of these days I have I become your enemy called enemy because I found the truth you know that's a little different when scripture was true in it all right let's see think about it the whole world and the basics of salvation you know Christianity preaches a redemptive message and don't want to get into the deep things right now come on is that right I mean you think about what are they preaching right over here what are they preaching out over here they're preaching you need to be saved they're preaching you need to do this the preaching you need to do that and you know what they're getting people to come to the altar they're getting salvation for the people they're getting people coming to churches they're filling the churches up and all and I know so you think that I'm just hateful because of doing it but if I told you the truth I mean is that the truth if that's not the truth somebody stand up and tell me that that's not the truth and I'll quit right now I won't finish this sermon because you know you can't argue that point you know what I'm saying is the truth that the world Christian systems deals basically with memberships with getting the people to churches getting them saved getting them to Sunday schools getting them to youth camps getting them to do it and says works right over into the message you know until it's word that people don't want to hear anything about salvation they won't mean about the depth of the message they want to hear some simple thing about salvation and I'm sorry but you think I don't do it but I cry and pray all the time this message right now that I'm trying to bring you is the hardest part that I've ever preached in my life no well no back up no thoughts no problem I'm just telling you that it's burden my heart because the one time I'm responsible for your soul but if I tell you the truth I'm not responsible so if I have to borrow no bum not gonna bar any holes in this I bar hold you think I don't look what I do a lot him but if it comes down to it I'll call names because people say I never heard brother so-and-so say that well maybe he didn't hear that in the more than you do hear me but that's alright if I do then you just forgive me yeah I know it's it's going with it what I'm just trying to get you to see the and spending or was it 17 sermons on salvation and never got out of the Old Testament because the word salvation in the Old Testament is deliverance and they had salvation back there they had deliverance they had God living in them they had things happening under that salvation they had a place to go to when they died it provided all of those things under salvation but I wouldn't a profit that said that the Old Testament only spoke for the knew that there was no redemption there's no word repent I mean the word redemption is used about fourteen times I think maybe a little less in the Old Testament but it's basically speaking of a redemption like a price paid for an individual it speaks nothing of a soul or a relation like you're doing the new work so that's what we've been over and over and over and over that nobody in that Old Testament had the new birth there was no way to have it because Jesus Christ had not died what you see I'm sorry but you see you make that statement and you say Church I understood that in the Baptist Church before I ever heard of this message or anything because I could read the Bible I could read the Bible you didn't read it the Bible tells you that the Holy Ghost is not been given because Jesus has not been crucified and the greatest of all I knew that in the Baptist Church and talked about it to the people were that it talks about John the Baptist the greatest of all we have one of the Bible said that said the least in the kingdom is greater than John what's the homem let's see I know now see you freeze up on there I don't know how to discernment don't have to have I got sense you freeze up when I say they didn't know baptism with the Holy Ghost back there I've went through everything sermon after sermon trying to express it even like we had their last Sunday you know talking about where brother Branham said to Adam only potentially and had the Holy Ghost I don't remember the exact wording but he said the prophets they just had the potentially went through trying to get you to see that even John the greatest of all receiving that Holy Ghost while he was in his mother's womb yet that did not put him in the kingdom that didn't put him in the kingdom now watch it we're going to get back to something in just a minute the Prophet said he said what's wrong with he said the baptism when the Holy Ghost is not taught correctly you remember that less famous names if you miss it I don't get that far he said we say baptism he said we say that like an automobile he said a lot goes with an automobile and I don't understand that's that's what I don't understand because taking what brother Branham has said and bringing it to you for 40 years over a lot of things that knowing that Adam had eternal life in his soul but over and over I've been through it with you Adam never went through justification sanctification and got the bad views and when the holy God no it was imparted to Adam he his way said to her Sunday he there was nothing had him at Dorney they had to repent to get life in him because he got life to start with he didn't have to repent to get it John the Baptist I've tried my best I've searched for 40-something years knowing that John received the Holy Ghost before in his mother's womb but knowing that it was not quote the baptism of the Holy Spirit because that come onto their Pentecost the last Sunday they're trying to get you to see that John never went to justification sanctification none of those Old Testament Saints could go through it Abraham only typed it he just typed it in the things that was doing in his life because they couldn't get eternal life back their end of their soul as a new birth because it wasn't dire well is that enough who can argue the point of salvation upon what I've just said what you know everybody ain't gonna believe it are you ain't gonna believe it you're sitting on now figuring out this figuring out now you wait'll we get over about another message from now and start reading some things brother Branham say it that literally looks like he don't know what in the world he's talking about we'll let him be the one that says it see that's what I say things like that then it just goes dead well you're trying to correct a prophet if I'm telling you what that prophet said you tell me some other way you tell me some other way than telling you what he said what are you following me the we went through Hebrews 9 where it speaks off that's nice they're back darkness on the internet for people out there in Hebrews nine or did it speaks of without the death of the testator you couldn't have a New Testament right there was no way to have a New Testament without the death of Jesus Christ so then it was potential which meant it was a partial realization you can even call what they had back there and earnest which is gonna have to be real careful because once we get this message out there's a little bit one more message we're gonna come into where we're not going to be talking about partial realization we're gonna be start talking about perfect realization but it would be perfect realization for right here but tomorrow it becomes partial until it's finished that's the message of why we changed the title we're talking about from salvation that comes basically on the point of you believing and we're going to go all the way to the redemption of the body and then you can say I got the baptism of the Holy Spirit because it's but what the Prophet What did he say he said it's been so incorrectly taught oh you little brother do you think you're teasing it correct come and show me I'm not arrogant or hateful come and show me I've never asked for anybody to do anything with that I've asked those that left here to come and show me where I wrong they ain't done it yet you can say what I think whatever well they ain't done it yeah well they do just know you're too arrogant hateful you ain't gonna listen well you know what that might mean if you come to them with the truth and I'm arrogant hey that makes me lost and you say so why don't you try it I don't mind talking to anybody cuz I don't understand a lot of things brother I never say it and I don't speak about it until I do understand it and then when I do understand it I read what he said now you gonna have to argue with him you can't come up to me and say that's your way of feeling at this if I'm saying what he said it ain't my wesen bring anything contrary but listen all of that back there was faced in the shed blood of an animal faith in that blood of that animal but it had no way to bring that life code it had no life to come back into the human being because it had no soul all right so then it was potential or what would keep them for a time and unless they wrote another one in here are like words to write it sustained about how you pronounce that sustained in other words that sustained him for the time for the time it was what was needed and it's abstained them for the time anybody I don't internet this you look it up but listen then if my quote right around him he said what about under the blood of bulls and goats and he said they could do all of these things he said what about you and I honor the baptism of the holy God right you realized then they told Old Testament Saints I tried my best to explain it to the Sunday those are Old Testament Saints that Holy Ghost could come on them so much until David could kill a bar a line and a giant by the Holy Ghost that come upon him and that was the Holy Ghost but it could not come and live within them as a new birth you realize the difference in you and the Old Testament Saints and you tell me oh I'm a believer I believe yes I believe that no arguing me on them times because I'll go back and quotes you where they believe so much and until Abraham took his child out and was going to kill him he's gonna show how he believed you gonna do it yours ain't doing that with mine so ain't that much of a believer I thought you blew I'm just trying to tell you you ain't either that's this plaintiff I can make it alright but getting it to the point of her that we can see the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament and then talking about those disciples that only had the Holy Ghost potentially I mean excuse me the justification the same things potentially back there they didn't have the Holy Ghost it hasn't come yet now it could come like it did with David and them it could come as an anointing upon them that's why brother Branham we'll get to it in many where he says the Holy Ghost he said it the baptism he said it has not been talked nine hundred and something different ways of understanding the new birth that's what he says why can't we believe it see see there was no redemption wait put it in his part the other day over and over there was no redemption in that Old Testament system the only spoke of redemption it only proclaimed the Old Testament proclaimed for the new spoke of it showed of it typed it because there was no way it could be back there you think this you think that I've just killed time and I know you get bored but one of these days maybe the next message I won't get to it tonight but we're going to start making some statements brother Brown and see it and if you ain't got all this as a background it's gonna show up in a hurry because you're gonna go out to Dover because you're gonna say I'm correcting brother Branham that I'm doing all of these things and you're gonna leave and the worst part of it a lot of you won't leave because they ain't nowhere else to go so you ain't gonna leave but you're gonna stay left and sit here that statement come out do it you're gonna stay here but you're gonna be gone you ain't gonna be like that sister on blasphemous names they said brother branham to call - the way you preaching that Holy Ghost that new birth I'm wondering whether I've got it or not because of the way he was preaching it he was preaching something contrary to every Baptist Methodist Presbyterian why couldn't you fit him in the category like I said well ago the whole world is preaching tonight salvation told you ain't in the Baptist Methodist no like a yeah they're not preaching seals plagues mild trumpets I ain't sayin somebody don't turn it on and do and listen I'm just saying you know what I'm telling you the truth their basic doubt is the salvation of point to get people to come to church and get memberships is what they want a million more than 44 right that was the Baptist in 44 but listen they were under potential until the fullness I'm quoting back from brother Branham trying to get down to where I can get into the message when he swore by on four by himself until the fullness of time come it was a potential waiting God's provided the place of worship waiting for the new one potential waiting for the new one new heart the new message to come just come on to a penny columns right Jesus preach that message but those disciples could go no father see I have a burden to pray because of trying to get things in the right order where you can understand and I make statements and then I know people how is it it took them three and a half years to come to a place they take it receiving the new birth but then the three thousand it took him 15 minutes to you're a sermon and there was the Holy Ghost and they got your new birth just exactly like the upper room except for one time the upper room was tutored and trained for three and a half years we'll get into adoptions with those thoughts but why and then you don't think about I was talking to brother there while ago matter see you don't think about that how come the Holy Ghost say I'm adding more to the thought we know the Holy Ghost came in Kinesis house huh that was just after pinnacle and the Bible said the Holy Ghost exactly like that night and it come many occasion then all at once you seem to have a dying down oh the coming of the holy God maybe the first church age lasted pretty good but after then you begin to drop down why Wow and am i telling you the truth you didn't start dropping down and say I prayed I prayed the Lord the other day said and I just said to her rejoice he said that devil started out in that early church blinding the people's eyes to the real understanding of what God was doing in the new birth and I said don't cry my soul goes I could see that's what happened you understand what I mean if you had to church ages to look at it you see it you see it in the first church age weight draw them out what is it and the Prophet trotted out us in the church said well what is it the first church age is got a little lip of black in it rest of it is white is it right next her shades had a little less wide next church age had a little less white next Church age had this - a little sliver of white at the bottom and all that was black why because Satan got into the minds of the people and started perverting them to the things that discipled even what's-his-name Evan a yes or whatever they wound up at the first and I see him counselor 325 AD then he wound up teaching that Jesus was another substance different substance from God you think they didn't do that you think that devil do you understand what happened do you get what happened the Holy Ghost fell into their penico why because they didn't have all their mind blackened out I'm talking about the 3000 outside they came out and seen the great things happening with a disciple and they said what can we do to be saved you know what they believed it may I explain it like this brother branham stay here in the States and not able to get know by the altar but go to the foreign fields and get twenty five thousand outstanding miracles at one time are twenty five thirty thousand born-again believers Wow because they hadn't heard the garbage was Satan started infiltrating with that garbage the end of that early church until they started dying down all right is it possible to test what's happening in the life state cause remember the last one goes totally out then I quoting brother Branham he left a little light the life one went and told darkness he left a little life that's why you talk to people now that's why you're sitting there you and the people of internet arguing with me about what I'm saying because you're trying to figure out something to argue with our quotes or thoughts and ideas instead of listening instead of saying hey he just made a point that was potential back there but it was enough to bring them and save them but we can't argue about potentials now if I get to it tonight when you see that baptism of the Holy Ghost falling on the day of Pentecost into the hearts of those signs that wasn't potential that was reality how come it is then they could go through the three thousand went through justification of sanctification and the baptism you've got to have that how the Newburg come on it's not just hear a sermon and jump up and down holler I got the new birth its justification sanctification the baptism when the old ghost is the new birth it took the disciples three and a half year to become justified and sanctified but outside it took three thousand people the insert they heard the word they went through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's like the upper room Nichola to the house of canoeist and just one sermon those people went through justification sanctification of baptism of the holy ghost to get the new murder but then you find another situation sitting in the Bible if you've got Paul with the powers that a Polish was preaching join them about Jesus Christ but the Holy Ghost wouldn't come on why he was proving the Bible says that Jesus was the Christ a pilot was what Paul say have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed we may we've been believe in long time we believe that we believe that would be he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe you know what when they believed it you know what Holy Ghost came on rock when you believed it and that was a church in Ephesus where we just read listen George you understand what I'm trying to say to you and I I know it it turns into you for me to make a statement like I do that I wish I could preach it everybody in this building would find out they were lost because they could do something about it I want you to preach to let me know I'm saved oh you shouted you spoken to him okay you got a bad one who you've done one of these didn't you let's let's back up some group here we got nine hundred ways of going at it are you listening so let's write nine hundred ways who's getting born here and surely you could fit in one of them right but you got enough sense to know that that don't save you you just won't admit it those like I've said over and over you're still under that old bad dish you have Methodist sometime you're still under that whole part you scared to death because you are afraid that you don't have what you think you've got okay what about it you remember the Romania and then maniac of get areal wear bread around says it say that Adam had the holy ghost potentially and he's talked about the Apostles and things in the way they had they had it potentially why because there was no baptism of the Holy Ghost they didn't have a new birth in the Old Testament they didn't have a born-again experience in the Old Testament they had an anointing of the Holy Ghost to fall upon them and great wonderful things happened but they never had a personal indwelling of this person of God come and live in them to give them so then you're to automatically know what I'm talking about you're to know where I'm going with the baptism of the Holy Ghost not something flowery coming out of heaven and all kind of things as you see you better read the book of Acts and see what happened in that upper room and how that there was a lick of tone on each one oh no it was just out shouting glory hallelujah oh they decide they just they just shut it on our loan okay I gave that into your brother Anderson so let's pull that up and start and we don't get very far we'll just go what we're gonna go and come back Sunday go ahead to number seven and let's just get this point out here because now listen if there's nine hundred in something different ways of the organizational systems I'll say it that way church is or whatever you want to call them but I'm not decreased United or nobody you're gonna find that out when I go along and get over into the message a little bit you're going to make light of me saying it so simple but remember you're gonna say what bread around said he said you get eternal life when you believe now do you want Tim quotes I've got them laying on the dash wellness where you do that now but just think about it nine hundred seven different ways of seeing a new birth let's just read one simple thing that he says and the problem with what's wrong from blasphemy his name is paragraph ninety What did he say he's talking about throwing the seat away you know you throw the when you get to our different group with him you know he said now there's some of these things you might miserably disagree with huh he said but don't do that don't throw it away if you eaten chicken don't throw the chicken away that stole the bone away are deceived you know whatever you run into and he said I believe that the reason that there is so much confusion today about the Holy Spirit it's not correctly taught I believe the baptism is taught and just say the baptism he's saying it's taught incorrectly but people teach the baptism now watch his answer but then be like you say automobile is that I got several mechanics and things like that he said now you know you've got spark plugs you got this and that in the other go to a car in other words you're talking about an automobile you've got a lot of things goes with it so he's saying you talking about the baptism you've got a lot to go with it you got a lot to go with the Holy Spirit other than just a Holy Spirit or baptism or what something so he said the baptism stalled well why is it taught 900 something different ways no now brother brother Dale down now dad that's not the quote brother branham said there was 900 several different ways to see in the Newberg oh I wish you hadn't said that because there's no teaching in the Old Testament at all about a new birth so you just wrapped yourself there's no teaching in the Old Testament about a born-again experience you just wrapped yourself there's no teaching in the Old Testament about a baptism of the Holy Spirit in the correct way of coming in and dwelling you you just killed your own point but you're not mean I'm man enough to admit it you won't just look at the thing and say well listen Lord what am i doing I mean that lady she got serious and she said I've got to have it but look what he says and when you talk about anytime an automobile got many parts with it and when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit then there's a lot goes with that see there's a lot goes with it that and here is what I think that God is proving that the Holy Spirit is here cause you're gonna give the answer right hey folks we ain't getting there tonight the brother Brennan said I want you to know what the baptism in the Holy Spirit is according to the Bible according to the saith the Lord 900 different ways of seeing the new birth and on her different ways of seeing the born-again experience called you putting them together 900 something different ways we're seeing the baptism with the Holy Spirit well brother Dale you can't tell me I ain't got the baptism then a person that's ever been born again what age of whatever you are they didn't get the baptism of the Holy Spirit for their time for their age for whatever it was but then you know for sure that I'm talking about a baptism of the Holy Spirit and don't go home and try to read and do and figure out all these things cause remember we're gonna talk about the new birth if I get that far denies Donal maternal Vernon read it we've read a random talks of the new birth and the born-again experience and the baptism of the holy ghost all in the same paragraph and he says there's no two comings of the spirit there's no way to do that he said you can't find it in the scripture said there's no such thing he's being born again and baptized the end of the body in the scripture but he's the one that taught that in his early part of his ministry but he didn't teach that he was teaching the truth in the baptism come on let's get to it think about it the prophets Adam and them had the Holy Ghost potentially so I knew I knew back in her in when I early come into a message and coming along an arc oh that was one of the first doctrines with the baptism of the Holy Spirit whether you had it or not you know and that was really the one of the big time try studied the message from that and wrote down everything I could find but I knew that eventually I would find a statement that brother Branham made two very fine what I knew he was talking about and that he would finally come down and say those Old Testament people had the Holy Ghost it was an anointing upon them but it was not in their soul as a new birth to put them into the kingdom because why did Jesus preach for the three and a half years and every message was about the kingdom you can't enter the kingdom right but I knew that I would find one day but just to find a quote for brother branham's not it that's not it with many just to find a quote I can find you a quote for anything you want somebody or somebody just give me a quote right off top of your head and I'll talk from the top of my head I believe our quote from the Bible or brother runs message something contrary to it right you know the bible does say baptize in the name of the Father Son Holy Bible don't say that it does hey put down what's the revelation what's the understanding the only way you'll be baptized name father son Holy Ghost be baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ but you can't take out father son holy God it says and that's why when I baptized I baptized wasn't exactly the way brother branham done because that's where I found it i baptize thee my brother my sister to fulfill the great commission of matthew 28:19 baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost i baptize you my brother or sister in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now there's no contradiction right but what about it when you got to where onto that message of the maniac from Oh got a real that's where we got to the seven eight and picked up a thought can I look what he says he said I'm not a debater and that's what the man was he was arguing about tongues read the whole before and after he was making a lot of people speaking in tongues and and he had his lineup to be right he said John never spoke in tongues he said you know oh he was naming them all and he's right but his point was he was going at it wrong so brother Branham was he say he they come down and he said now Zechariah didn't speak in tongues and I said that was before the holy ghost was ever given look what the man come back with man come back he said well they said they had a you know what his statement were they say they had the Spirit of God dwelling in them they say they had God living in there they say they had it once him I said now they did not say they had the baptism of the holy ghost now he's making a difference between just an anointing Balaam was anointed with the Holy Ghost but he had no perhaps his room that would have changed it well I just don't really I believe bad piers my whole go same time it is because it could anoint this person over here the same Holy Ghost it anoints you is the same Holy Ghost it anoints deal that's where people don't agree with me on the new bar are they teaching the other could you see I believe every born-again believer gets an anointing on their spirit it's same as an anointed one gets an anointing on their spirit the only difference is the born-again believer has held the word and the spirit when it comes down on to the word it quickens it and there's your new birth in the soul now go home with that one because if you don't believe it you say I never heard you teach it that's what I've taught for 40 years that Holy Spirit comes down on your spirit its body to body spirit to spirit soul to soul that baptism Californa Balaam or come upon an anointed one in time and it don't make the word alive in them why because it's the wrong word and God can't quicken that but a person has held that true word that's why I said well ago what I did it's got to where you can't hardly get people to listen long enough about the Holy Ghost because they've got sold so much about it until they know all about it and he ain't gonna listen to you well if you're telling them the truth what if they're a Polish what if when powell said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe pollicis a blessed God I'll have you know we've been believers long in you have and I've been proving Jesus was the Christ when used-up crucify me no he didn't do that did he shut his mouth and listen to a man they said a few words and the Holy Ghost fell I said now they did not say they had the baptism of the Holy Spirit now he's explaining what he's talking about Adam had the Holy Ghost potentially he didn't have the baptism with the Holy Ghost put him in the body of Christ but he had the Holy Ghost all the profits as they were moved by the holy ghost so John had the Holy Ghost within him but he didn't put him in the body of Christ because the least in the kingdom was greater than he is look John said that the Holy Ghost had not yet come for the Jesus had not been horrified what about it Church yeah I know what caused me to fall in popularity as you see I'm repeating things now that I repeated Sunday that I repeated the Sunday before in the Sunday before in the Sunday before and you're getting tired of hearing it well then you know what that makes it you don't know what I'm talking about if you get tired of here I never get tired of hearing anybody preaching on water baptism I get so I get so enjoyed with somebody just preaching the message of water baptism don't you you know why cuz I've been about that three times one time Father Son the Holy Ghost next time Lord Jesus Christ and then I got to go to Israel and was baptized in the River Jordan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I enjoy hearing people talk about one God I enjoy ministers preaching about their own salvation and the way they came I'm gonna get both heard that before well you stick around here you probably heard some more now what about it their disciples off the third seal you can be sanctified without the justification you'll be justified right you can be sanctified without receiving the Holy Ghost the disciples in st. John 17:17 was sanctified in power given and given power to cast out devils and still didn't have the Holy Ghost see they had to go up to Pentecost and wait till the Holy Ghost came that's where Judas showed his colors now remember the scripture acts 1 and 8 but you shall receive power Jesus speaking to the disciples but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you go up to Jerusalem he said and wait well we got some good old bad news Upton in Jerusalem lately cold what did they say your profits weren't have done it he said that man said he said well I think we got it we just take it by faith he said somebody stood up and said but we ain't got what he said we ain't got the power from on high and like I've always treated you don't like that but what was the easiest way of saying it when you said you ain't got the Holy Ghost cause you ain't got the power from on high see he'll be the first one go out the door and start preaching then they turned around sit down and shut up right go they wasn't going out when the Holy Ghost came out to door they went searching for anybody to preach to right what about it so then we're up to the point let's read these now and get just a little bit so let's start with number 11 number 10 is where it says in acts 1 & 8 let's go to number 11 let's get a few of them then I'll quit this is 142 I would ask you to just do this turn to 142 in some learning church age you'll have to get you church age book and related to that and just read about five pages and just see what your profits it because they're right here copy it off on this paper but angle how time let's read not unless y'all won't stay till 10 11 o'clock I think sarcastic it's true cuz I got him right there you just got the notes turn over look at him goes from 144 - 145 146 147 148 it starts on 144 and goes to 148 read it that's now in the Samaritan Church ages not this church age boomer huh now before we leave this subject I want to make myself clear on what the baptism with the Holy Ghost is according to the word it is not according to me it is not according to you it has to be according to the sayeth the Lord are we are falsely led now we've got to stay with that because we don't we in bad shape okay let's read a couple in between and then go back to it remember what we we used the Holy Ghost has been so incorrectly taught until people don't know what it is you remember that blasphemous name but we need to read that and again that's been so incorrectly tall right come on now listen what he says here on Oh why is that so many people so many Christians find it hard to believe that live the Christian life that's in 57 if you say the baptism of the Holy Ghost was promised on the day of Pentecost to you and your children and to them that is a far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call the old dry skin just burst now you know what he's talking about new skin put it in and you just lose your sermon and listen if you don't believe that the Holy Ghost if you say the baptism of the Holy Ghost was promised on their Pentecost to you and to your children now you know what he goes on safe because I promise to you and me right is that what it says the book of Acts all right in their hearts of Kult see what's in them that's afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call the old dry skins burst open and you lose your sermon it doesn't do any good and I'm ashamed that Pentecostal skins are drying like that that's right come back to the word now watch what he says notice now a new skin he said the new iron is put into the new bottles and the new skin has all in it flexible then when the Holy Spirit comes down and says the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the same today as it ever was now do you agree with that the baptism of the Holy Spirit if he's Hebrews 13:8 then the baptism of the Holy Spirit is here today and he's been in every age and every time the baptisms been there it was the word that was eat down not the baptism it stayed Luther and then Wessling them had the baptism with a hole to go but they had to bring get it under the way God brought it for the Aged he had to wink it to her ignorant but they still got it because they're in the body you say are the end of body well this is the drawing that your prophet mate Paul Iranians Martin Columba Luther Wesley in the kingdom that enough to solve the problem all right shut that no race that now you say well that probably doesn't call me huh but listen divine healing is the same as it ever was the Word of God is preached in it ever time the Word of God is preached in its power the new skin will holler amen it'll give away so to the wisdom and when all I can't now what do you understand what it's saying when the Holy Spirit comes down and says the baptism of the Holy Spirit is the same today as it ever was now that's what he's always teaching but you're going to hear him say things that sound totally contrary to that we'll get to them but just remember this is your finality he said we've got to and this is 154 this is in part of you reading if you'll read all the way down and get it but listen all right go to number 13 because we just we done read this one well we read again and not on the wind read this we'll read it you know we got them two or three times in here all right fire it 154 what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost now what is it well I believe that shouted I cried as float huh well I'll be justification with it what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost now he's going to answer it it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ the disciples justified sign five-day getting the body of Christ until the Holy Ghost can you say all about how much you believe and what you think you've done what you went through until you got the baptism the whole ocean you're not in the body of Christ what is the baptism with the holy go it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth so now we've got that settled what is the new birth the new birth is the baptism with the Holy Ghost what is the baptism when the whole ego justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't go and buy pipes those three stages because when you try to bypass them three stages I'm going back to John for John 14 what nine eight forty but is when Jesus when he said you must be born again he's got to be born of water and spirit now I'm gonna go back to a seed and hand you a piece of corn and I'm gonna say yeah stick that under that rug and let's get some corn Dee died awhile you're gonna have to have those three listen three not works I've got a right here it's not three works of the whole ago it's three stages of the whole ego it's the Holy Ghost that justifies it Holy Ghost is sanctified Holy Ghost it baptized okay now we got where we're going what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth into the Spirit of God coming in and filling you after you have repented having heard his word now listen and been baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience toward God so what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't have to bring this up but it can if they want to but I'll read it questions and answers on the seals each one of those ages only taking a dip into the holdest into this Holy Spirit justification is the work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism what is the Holy Spirit what is the baptism when Holger it's a baptism of the Holy Spirit after you've been justified and sanctified justification because you believe is not the baptism with old ago sanctification cause you believe is not the baptism with all that goes okay he goes on to cover then let's see where did we get to go to number 15 because I love this one the order no it is from the future home paragraph 86 how that God makes it plain to us and we're gonna use this but you know what he's talking about and if that wasn't a great confirmation good a great loving blessing from God when I see this and see that sense of boy first time ever Christ dealt with me I've still always taught those three stages of grace notice it's not true now when we get into things later that brother Branham says this and says this remember that remember these things I could put that title on the message now remember what is the baptism of the Holy Spirit brother Branham it is the Spirit of God baptizing you into the body after you have been relieved after you've accepted Christ after you've been sanctified you're filled with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and he said from the beginning I've always taught that so now when it comes up later that sounds like contrary to what he's saying remember that's what he said three processors so when he said I believe you get eternal life when you believe it's gonna have to be brought into that state I believe that when you believe you get eternal life that's when you truly believe not make believe truly believe what we got No last three messages of the life three ages completes the birth okay let's don't go to that let's go 14 let's go to 16 16 is God's provided way of healing said when a man is born again he's three elements that he has to go through water blood spirit justification by faith believing on the Lord sanctification that life being cleaned up and the baptism of the Holy Ghost not three works of grace one grace notice justification by faith sanctification through the blood and the baptism of the Holy Ghost then he explains the baby so he's got it you got to hold that now keep that thought go to the next one he swore by himself he said that was justification same case the baptism with Holy Ghost not three different dispensations not three works of grace but one work in three different manifestation now quote the Prophet he said justification makes way for sanctification sanctification makes way for the baptism with the Holy go it's all got to be God through those through stages you don't get it in one stage I've heard him preach that in this message and I don't agree with it I've heard him preaching this message that Luther just had one stage and he went through I don't agree with that I don't care if you can bring me a quote that looks like that I know what he said if you don't go through three stages you're not born again he ain't gonna sort cut it for nobody everybody's got the same way getting into the kingdom right see not three different dispensations not three works of grace but one work and three different manifestation going to the next one the next one is explaining simply where you'll keep it in your mind about the dedication of a building how that your soul body and spirit and your three compartments know God dwells in three God's perfect injury the church is perfect in three and what does he come to your solo body in spirit who got the three things so he's got to deal with you and the three things to get the new birth and the church is perfected through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you're sealed so you're not sealed of justification you're not sealed at sanctification you're not sealed until the Holy Ghost comes on you for the day of your Redemption that's once purged by the blood of Jesus Christ has no more desire of sin you pass from death unto life okay go ahead to the next one the life's remakes are just a same kids baptism over that completed the birth that order be enough I'm just bringing it from the body to make up the new to make up the birth now you ought to understand what he's talking about the last three messages you got with justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the lifestream messages the life's research ages forms the complete birth all right so he's tying to ages the birth and everything together all right let's see if we can get at least one more what is that number 19 we are number 20 hey we're doing pretty good and look what happens Israel in the church now here he comes torn ribbon torn to pieces he sold what to God God blessed it and then his soul returned back in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that comes into every believer to sanctify cleaned up the mind cleaned up the heart and leave a portion of the Holy Ghost in there here and there when the Holy Ghost is given out in the same Holy Spirit they brought the body of Jesus Christ over the grave will rapture yeah now where does it come from the Holy Ghost comes back to you the baptism with holes in the form of the soul of God the soul of God comes and lives in you because eternal life are you listening okay the next he goes through in perfection talking about well let's read death imperfection the message he's talking about the Corinthians and said by one spirit 21 yeah okay because the human spirit was alive the higher line of life than the animal but no other animal spirit could come back if you got the spirit of some ancestor a spiritualism but God Himself came that his own spirit which is the highest line of spirit there is can come back by the form of the baptism of the holy spirit to the worshiper through the blood of Jesus Christ and take him into the body right he's safe he's in the body okay give me just a minute I mean okay let's go for just a little go to 22 we're still reading in the church age book movie back on par page 154 what is the baptism with the holy spirit is a spirit of God baptizing the body of Christ it is a new birth is the Spirit of God coming and filling you after you repented having heard his word and been baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience toward God now this is a continuation what you've got there is a continuation what we have just set forth would be much easier for all to understand if all believe the doctrine of the oneness of the Godhead now do you see why that they're arguing over the new birth come on is that clear why are they arguing over the new birth with 900 syphillis seeing it because of what they don't have they understand another one that's in the Godhead if they had that it wouldn't be argued about it if they had any sense you remember my statement Horton brother mol tonight he said what do you believe I said one God in three persons he said would you mind explaining that I said well you know we just got to say it was a garden three-person he said you just as much of Trinitarian is anybody else here I said explain yourself sir he said if Father Son and Holy Ghost is three persons you're just as Trinity is anybody I said I don't believe that no more I didn't have to study weeks and months and I didn't have to go back to my school of theology I went to an e ology to find out what was going on listen the reason you've got to misunderstanding may I put it as - any doctrine in this message may I do it with that any doctrine it's the message the reason you don't have the understand if the people don't understand is cuz they don't understand the oneness with the Godhead how can you have two souls under the one God teaching of the correctness how can you have river Jordan that Jesus wouldn't got until the River Jordan under the teaching of oneness not one that's like that he said I resent that he said but I'm one this one true and living God look for there are not three persons in that Godhead but one thus listen thus we are not born again by the spirit of life of Jesus coming in and then subsequent which means sometimes are after subsequent to that the Holy Spirit coming in to give us power he said we don't believe that but we're going to read where your prophet says it that you get eternal life and then you believe for power coming from heaven we're gonna have to find out what he's talking about because remember he's got to go back to where his statement he made is he's a prophet he's got to go back to the statement he made in the future huh they always talk to three processes come on listen they told us we're coming in to go as power if that were true it was true now that you can get the born-again experience and then you get the Holy Ghost that's coming to give us power if that were true why are we dis honoring the father but not giving him a part in our complete salvation whereas salvation is of the Lord and there are three lords then he father must have something to do - but surely it can be seen that Jesus made this very clear that it was he and he alone who is God and it is he and he alone who is coming into the believer st. John 14:16 that the father will send another comforter but verse 17 says that he Jesus dwelleth in them and should be in them later and those come in verse 18 he says that he will come to them in verse 23 and speaking to the disciples he said we father and son will come unto Him thus it's the Father Son and Holy Ghost all coming in at the one time for it's one person comprising the Godhead wonderful when I got the Holy Ghost and then I got Jesus watch him one person comprising the Godhead that Advent are happening took place at Pentecost there aren't two comings of the Spirit just one that can come in three stages of justification the same case the baptism with home go but it's only one salvation there's not three comings it's not one of them justifying you know sanctifying you and feeling you it ain't one of them didn't we a little bit down here at the bottom of the pyramid you get moping in and then another another God takes over coming up a little father and then a father comes one up here what kind of water where are we yeah but you were just arrogant one of these days you'll Pat me on the back and glory say thank you for being arrogant but you know what when I get there I'll be just like a man said to me one time he said brother Dale I'm sorry for the way I've treated you I said you're forgiven for you ever done it and I'm in it I said before you ever done it you was forgiven because I have no feelings for just anybody maybe one day days you know maybe one day days we're gonna preaching what do you turn alive here you know what is eternal life is everybody know what are you turn alive here oh thank you you got it you turned life is living for others that's what's your prophet said living for others not yourself that Advent took place at Pentecost aren't two comings of the Spirit just one the trouble is that the people don't know the real truth and they simply believe in Jesus for remission of sins but never go on to receive the Holy Spirit all right I'm gonna have to stop dark because if I go to the next he's gonna take 45 minutes or more and I don't want to do that we'll try to pick it up Sunday we'll review and we pick it up okay but just remember one thing that I've taught you that's what I've always taught there's just one true and living God it's not a Holy Ghost that comes down on you and a father that comes down to do this and the son slips into you somewhere he just said that that Advent took place at penticoff it was a Father Son and Holy Ghost coming in at one time now may I repeat what I said while ago those people of the 3000 outside went through justification sanctification the baptism when the whole ego and the very person of Jesus Christ came within them to give them eternal life and put them into the body of Christ same thing happened the canoe you said house the same Holy Ghost the Bible says or what say they can we forbid that good water or baptism what it said see and they receive the Holy Ghost we did at the beginning there's never been but one baptism of the Holy Delta there's never been but one way into the body of Christ they don't change with the ages in time whatever started is 1/10 is the counterpart for everyone so whatever you think I don't care I'm sorry you say well I don't see how Luther and then went through this with Westar then went through them if you're living back there you'd shout glory hallelujah whatever God done to do it he done it because you can't get into the body of Christ without justification sanctification and the baptism when the Holy Ghost anything else is impartation that's why you foolish virgin will get eternal life given unto that's the field field you will be eternal I've given unto with 144,000 gives eternal life here that's where those Old Testament Saints he's gonna come up and they're gonna get eternal life into their soul and they were the ones that rejected Christ you think justification and a wonderful message if the fact that they was the hunt that the fish feel Jew comes up to the point that they're saved that's the most wonderful thought of justification you could ever think that God would back away that's where we don't we don't believe it we don't believe that Church right over there we won't you know you want to throw it at me if I say something you want to throw it at me well brother Dale don't thank them people don't you ever think I don't think then people are over can be saved then people right over there could be saved at the white throne judgment and be given eternal life and me and you stand out because of our sarcastic attitude and our ways we're talking about them we could stand there at the white throne and be cast into hell I'll believe that brother Dale we didn't get bored again cause Abel one way to bypass it the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and being born again is the same experience now listen to what the statement I made it to other day yeah the round said receiving the Holy Ghost without a sensation did he say that he said that was one of the mysteries for the last night but you know what he never said you can receive the baptism when the Holy Ghost without an experience I want you to bring me that quote I'll quit preaching the day you can bring me these statements because I'm a false prophet too so you can't have the new birth without an experience but you can have it without a sensation but around them never done away with any form of movements or ideas or thoughts of people believing it he said lay under the spout listen to him he said lay under the spout and one day you'll come for speaking in trunk you know what he was encouraging laying under the spout wouldn't it this is one thing I've always helped with in my heart to try to get people to see God is a good card and he'll come to me and you and he'll come to our ways of thinking not deal do you know training you'll come down into our little bitty thoughts and her little bitty ideas and bring us to himself and give us a new birth listen to the Prophet who is listening another day where he had to bunch of children they come up the altar and he prayed for the whole group of children and he said see how are you believers he says you got eternal life he never mentioned no baptisms he didn't go into all of the things but he said you die you go into heaven that church as I said right over there then people could wind up and be our condemnation and we're thinking we're better than they are come on musicians that's thinking we're better than they are this in church it's about time for us to get settled on one time I believe in a definite experience for the baptism of the Holy listen I believe it this way I believe in a definite experience now because we're not back there see when they were back dire that three thousand outside they went through justification sanctification the baptism the whole ghost under one message but brother Branham I'll read it to you if you read on over there only 148 right in there he said very few people ever believe all the way under receiving the Holy Spirit very few people will ever leave that far but you see let me get started just believe it and then let me say lord help my unbelief well from there I'm not gonna say I'm lost nobody asked you to anybody ever ask you to say you lost that should have been settled today you knew yours lost this shouldn't be any problem should have been settled in because listen if you your sins are forgiven like Wade was bringing Wednesday done Sunday if your sins are forgiven you'll never have to answer for that sin right I don't care who we are I don't care what you wind up inhale and bust it wide open but you ain't going to hell for them sins if you repent because God is just and will forgive you for that sin so then god this is the one way to find out where the God's talking to your the devil with a little voice comes to you and me preaching this series so I'm warning you a little voice will come to you and say you're lost you need to be saved just stay back to that little voice this I might not be where I'm supposed to be I might not be saved but there's one thing about it ain't lost because you did think enough of me to come to me Nicodemus wouldn't lost come on brother Brian said Nicodemus in Khmer you would get eternal life come on there wouldn't lost if God forgives your sins you're not lost you may not be where you need to be you may need a whole lot more because just because the sins are forgiven don't mean if you're born again either so that voice comes to you and says you're lost just say I'm gonna agree with you to a certain degree there but I'm surely not lost cuz if I was lost you wouldn't be fooling with me don't you talk to it like that but brother Dale I don't talk to the devil to you about 99% of the time I'm talking to him I guess boy or an odd person what you gonna tell me you're talking to God all day long I'm gonna tell you you're a locker is that enough and Liars don't have no part in heaven so they don't need in lying about something my life in Tobruk that one day there was going down the road and me and him look at his life and talk about each other than things and I said brother mode you know what the divorce telling me to do right now he said one I said his voice telling me to run into that tree dunya on your side the car it started dying laughing they was boys telling me to do that but I wasn't gonna do it but I didn't mind telling him that's what was telling me something what well we got let's take them to 11 river what is the baptism of the Holy Spirit [Music] and say [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh forgive me [Music] baby what about it do you know what the new birth is if the person of Jesus Christ coming and wedding in your soul to make your soul return all of the bad vision for the host if God making that word alive that you took inhale [Music] I see I asked if he was doorman myrn interchange find what the profit counters well it'll be page 144 if you're going on your computers italy's and run up and just read remember just remember one time hold it this minute breath just remember one time when you start reading that church age book and you're reading what's your prophet taught there's gonna voice come to you and say the church age book is not authentic the police search don't be as narrow-minded when I'm throwing off on the brother made a statement but he told us he said lavell didn't write that church aid book sadly failed wife wrote it I said brother eggy told me to talk talk talk to me later not on the company I wouldn't our next morning I talked with him I said brother what do you mean he said well I've been told that Levi l's wife wrote the church age book I said no brother Levi L wrote the church age book under brother branham's direction but you see he had been told something and he believed it I said she copied it all she typed it up she didn't write it Oh they've got this great things mr. Church age book he's wrong 17:28 or something contradicts I've asked him on internet and I've asked every work send it to me to show me where that is a contradiction in that church age book because I'm gonna show you some times that you never thought up letter on him quote Wade was bringing the other day the rapture takes place on the fourth seal that's how the church age blood that's things knowing about it that was way above the church ages you see you've heard what somebody said and you'll take what somebody said instead of God in his word father you know our heart you know what I don't claim to be nothing but just to believe what you want to be want me to be it's what I want to be and they're trying to tell the truth so that we can have an opportunity to be able to walk before you Lord and say we believe this we stood with it when the world all went after all the other things we still were standing with you just have your way with all of us forgive our sins Lord if bless let's take care of everybody on the way home and remember the sick among us because Lord you promised it you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you and we expect it to take place because we're not demanding you to do anything we're just asking you to fulfill your word all of these that are sick and things make everything work out Lord we've got enough sense to know we can't believe for the whole world it wouldn't do any good but we can believe or the people around us and the groups and the things that we are we can believe that and we can thank you for it we're not going to talk about empty in hospitals but there's nothing wrong with walking down the aisle of a hospital and praying for half the people that was back had to be your word let's take care of the people on the way home we love you and we thank you in Jesus is your name [Music]
