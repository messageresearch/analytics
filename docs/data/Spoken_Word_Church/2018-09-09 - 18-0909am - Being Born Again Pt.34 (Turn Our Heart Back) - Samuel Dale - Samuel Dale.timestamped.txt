[18:48] so have your way now and just guide each
[18:52] one and Lord let our understanding be
[18:56] opened because that's the desire of our
[18:58] heart we love you and we thank you in
[19:01] Jesus name Amen if you'd like turning
[19:03] your scriptures turn to first Peter 1
[19:07] that we've been reading and this is kind
[19:10] of an injected message alright so we're
[19:13] going to change the scripture that we
[19:16] will be reading 1st Peter 1:22 and 23
[19:19] then we're going to first kings and kind
[19:22] of jump over because it a little thought
[19:24] I've got in mind I want you to get and I
[19:27] believe that it'll be very interesting
[19:28] to see how well the Scriptures light
[19:32] together and maybe you do that see I
[19:36] don't bring these things out a lot of
[19:39] times because it just maybe it's for me
[19:42] but I'll
[19:43] see the word lay together I like to see
[19:44] it here here and here and then I don't
[19:47] have to worry about it all right because
[19:49] I know it's true this compares to this
[19:52] this here and now all of them comes out
[19:54] to be and to bring forth the same point
[19:57] all right so let's go to first Peter
[20:02] 1:22 and 23 then we'll go to first Kings
[20:06] 18 all right seeing you have purified
[20:10] your souls and obeying the truth through
[20:12] the spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[20:14] Brethren see that you love one another
[20:16] with a pure heart fervently being warned
[20:19] again not of corruptible seed now how
[20:22] are you born again not of corruptible
[20:24] seed but of incorruptible by what by the
[20:30] Word of God which liveth and abideth for
[20:33] ever so how are you born again by the
[20:36] Word of God that is incorruptible and
[20:40] that's why it's so important to hear the
[20:42] word and truly then faith comes by
[20:46] hearing and hearing by the word so it's
[20:49] very vital to hear that word preached
[20:51] correct clear come on maybe that's why I
[20:55] wrote a renter would make that statement
[20:57] you know he said you know there's not so
[21:00] many new burst
[21:01] he said because I'm putting a couple of
[21:04] quotes together but false prophets will
[21:07] bring false verse he said true prophets
[21:10] will bring the birth of the word so then
[21:13] we follow the word and try to understand
[21:16] that alright let's go down to 1st Kings
[21:19] 18 and you'll see immediately when we
[21:22] get started of what we're dealing with
[21:25] we won't read all of this but this was
[21:28] the time when bail and they come and
[21:31] Elisha it had been called to a showdown
[21:34] and as it come to the showdown then
[21:38] here's what was happening verse 36 and
[21:41] it shall come and it excuse me and it
[21:44] came to pass at the time of the offering
[21:46] of the evening sacrifice I remember they
[21:49] had done went through the things
[21:51] happening the prophets of Vail couldn't
[21:54] bail couldn't get
[21:56] nothing to happen and all like that then
[21:58] Elijah restores the altar the things
[22:00] happens and then a wonderful situation
[22:03] comes to pies and it shall come to pass
[22:05] and it came to pass at the time of the
[22:08] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[22:11] Elijah the Prophet came near and said
[22:13] Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let
[22:18] it be known this day that thou art God
[22:19] in Israel and that I am thy servant and
[22:25] that I have done all these things at thy
[22:28] word now he'd seen a vision he's
[22:31] fulfilling the word making it take place
[22:34] know what hear me o Lord hear me that
[22:37] this people may know that thou art the
[22:39] Lord God and that thou has turned their
[22:43] heart back again and then the fire of
[22:47] the Lord fell and consumed two burnt
[22:50] sacrifice in the woods and the things
[22:51] and all like that happened in the doing
[22:54] you may be seated the Lord had his
[22:56] blessing to the reading of the word now
[22:58] I said I want to kind of put a little
[23:01] message in that will help us to
[23:07] understand and things in us as I said I
[23:11] like to see Scripture compared with
[23:14] Scripture you know to find something in
[23:17] one place is good wonderful great praise
[23:20] God but to find it in many places it
[23:25] gives us more more of a purity for
[23:31] knowing what is taking place all right
[23:33] now this Elijah we know in the Bible
[23:37] that the spirit not to man the spirit of
[23:43] Elijah is promised in the Bible to come
[23:47] forth five times all right it was Elijah
[23:53] okay
[23:54] then Elijah all right then John the
[24:00] Baptist reviews the scriptures and I and
[24:04] then the fourth coming of Elijah to be
[24:08] the to the Gentile dispensation
[24:09] and the fifth time is one of the two
[24:13] witnesses going to Israel is the spirit
[24:16] and power of Elijah now for that we want
[24:22] the understanding of seeing how perfect
[24:25] then the word is God loved that spirit
[24:29] may not necessarily the man see cause
[24:32] it's a different man each time it's not
[24:33] the same man in reincarnation or
[24:36] something you know we don't believe in
[24:38] that but it's the person who who fits
[24:43] the the bill of the time and what's
[24:47] taking place you know in the doing that
[24:51] we would divide it then as to the coming
[24:55] of Elijah okay now we know that Elijah
[25:00] had four miracles Elijah had eight
[25:04] miracles okay because the lied Elijah
[25:07] had a double portion okay because those
[25:12] were coming into that line all right
[25:14] then it's promised in Isaiah 40 of the
[25:19] coming you know the voice of one crying
[25:20] in the wilderness go that's what John
[25:22] declared himself to be when he came
[25:25] forth and as he came forth in to be the
[25:29] spirit of Elijah coming in that day all
[25:33] right then we know that it was promised
[25:37] throughout the word for him coming that
[25:40] away okay alright like I said now you go
[25:43] to Luke 1:17 and you'll find that it's
[25:46] declaring melikhaya four has to be a
[25:51] part of the Word of God and that's what
[25:53] we'll tie to in a minute because I want
[25:55] you to look at something it's very
[25:57] amazing how everything if you look at it
[26:01] it will compare exactly okay all right
[26:06] we won't be dealing with the first
[26:08] coming of Elijah as much just mention it
[26:10] Makoto's got to be brought to lay down
[26:12] the story and not the second time but
[26:16] the third and the four time of the
[26:18] coming of Elijah it's so amazing
[26:23] how much similarity or ever how you use
[26:26] those big old words I'm not too good on
[26:28] education but the the kind of comparing
[26:32] one with the other and how they compare
[26:34] to each other and to see how that it
[26:38] fits
[26:39] now you're going to how to listen when
[26:42] we get to the end because we're going to
[26:45] hit a little spot that maybe you hadn't
[26:50] thought about comparing but I like to
[26:53] compare things to where that I can see
[26:55] it if I can see it in one place and
[26:57] comparing it in another you know I've
[27:00] got a double confirmation right see then
[27:03] my hopes is built more on that to line
[27:06] it up so what we're going to be doing is
[27:08] comparing the spirit and power of Allah
[27:13] Allah or Elisha
[27:15] either one you want to use the wording
[27:16] code it's interchangeable in the
[27:18] scriptures in the days of John the
[27:21] Baptist and how that he was to come and
[27:25] what he was to do alright then move from
[27:29] that over into our day and see you know
[27:37] how it compares with that day this is
[27:42] exactly in comparison to it and it'll
[27:44] come out - I'm hoping you'll follow it
[27:48] to the line that that I'm trying to
[27:50] bring it because like I said it's just
[27:52] an injected message into the point I've
[27:56] been on the statue of perfect man man
[27:58] now for quite a while well we're going
[28:00] to kind of inject this message in
[28:02] because I believe it will help us to
[28:05] understand where we're at and what's
[28:07] taking place and has taken place in our
[28:11] a day
[28:12] all right now so they said now we're not
[28:15] concerned much with Elijah but yet it
[28:19] does say you know in Malachi 4 how you
[28:23] come and turn the hearts of the children
[28:24] to the father's you know the the
[28:27] father's to the children the children to
[28:29] the father's and things like that that
[28:31] would be in laying in the order and then
[28:34] we read in the Kings
[28:37] that when Elijah comes to this point and
[28:39] he's challenged or brought on this point
[28:42] you know to to perform and God performs
[28:46] and consumes the whole water everything
[28:51] you know we know the story and Elijah
[28:54] then he knows and he sees and he said
[28:57] and it says of that and we rather said
[29:00] let it be known that their heart is
[29:02] turned back alright back there now God
[29:06] is looking forward to show us way over
[29:10] here in the four thousand close the
[29:14] years later something comparison that
[29:17] this that it's going to take place that
[29:20] he's going to let them see that their
[29:22] heart has turned back all right now back
[29:26] guard they had gotten away if you read
[29:28] the story and get the comparison they
[29:30] had gotten away from God and went after
[29:32] two different things and that's why bale
[29:34] gets involved and all of the things
[29:36] that's happening and when it does it
[29:39] comes down and he's telling them to let
[29:42] it know that their heart has turned back
[29:43] to the word the word of that day you
[29:47] know to the god of that day all right
[29:49] now that comparison comes down but
[29:52] what's the comparison as we go a little
[29:54] bit further into the scriptures to line
[29:58] things up all right we know then that
[30:03] John was promised to come in the
[30:07] scripture because if isaiah 40 you know
[30:10] the voice of one crying in the
[30:12] wilderness you know all of those things
[30:14] was promised in the word that John would
[30:18] come all right and turn the hearts I
[30:20] mean and coming and introduced the
[30:23] Messiah that would be his job would be
[30:27] to introduce the Messiah that's what I
[30:28] want you to watch in a minute because
[30:31] there's a lot of difference between
[30:32] introducing the Messiah and the Messiah
[30:36] itself and what transpires so listen to
[30:41] the point now and and I believe it'll
[30:44] help you to understand the very hour
[30:46] that we're living and the things that
[30:48] has transpired so
[30:50] see that John he's born you know and
[30:53] there's you remember his dad mom Knoll
[30:55] age and and he was told to name him John
[30:58] and all and then when it when it comes
[31:01] to Pais that John and the Lord Jesus or
[31:04] what about second third cousins in the
[31:07] line of natural type of lineages coming
[31:11] down of course you can't run lineage to
[31:13] Jesus you run it it comes to Mary you
[31:16] can't come to Jesus with Joseph because
[31:19] Joseph didn't have anything to it but
[31:20] it's just a comparison or a thought all
[31:24] right so then John when he comes on the
[31:27] scene what was John's job trying to cut
[31:31] it a little short I've got a lot written
[31:35] down and gave them a lot of scriptures
[31:36] but we're trying not to do that because
[31:38] they were they're kind of shy on the
[31:41] pole back there are they with the others
[31:43] being gone in time so we will kind of
[31:46] keep it as close as we can all right
[31:48] but John understands his message what is
[31:54] his message and he shall go before him
[32:00] and the Spirit in the power of Allah or
[32:02] Elijah to do what what was the basics of
[32:07] John the Baptist now what was the basics
[32:10] of his time and what he was doing and
[32:14] then you'll see exactly that that lays
[32:17] down to the age that we're living worth
[32:20] it there you see why we like so much
[32:21] emphasis upon God sending a prophet in
[32:24] this day and the things because it
[32:27] compares exactly if you'll follow it
[32:30] between John the Baptist's and the
[32:33] spirit in the paradise and brother
[32:36] Branham coming with a spirit in the
[32:38] power of a life to come to do those
[32:40] things all right but let's watch it
[32:42] unfold called there's a few little
[32:43] things in between that if you don't see
[32:47] correctly you're not going to get it all
[32:50] right
[32:50] the cause like I said melikhaya mankind
[32:57] read Malachi that read it and read it
[32:59] where did they ever pick out that they
[33:01] was going to be a coming now we
[33:04] knew the Scriptures I say this a lot of
[33:08] times because you you you don't think
[33:09] that we understood a lot but I've told
[33:14] you before and whether you believe it or
[33:16] not the first time I read the Bible to
[33:21] read it through
[33:21] I came to Malachi 4 3 & 4 and in that I
[33:27] told my wife I said according to the my
[33:30] my understanding you've got Malachi 3 in
[33:33] Malachi 4 I said according to my
[33:35] understanding there's going to be two
[33:37] prophets come before the end of the
[33:39] world I could see that by reading the
[33:43] word and believing it you know we read
[33:47] the scriptures we believe that we taught
[33:49] in the scriptures and the different
[33:51] thing but the best mankind can do will
[33:54] say okay
[33:55] now this is the West done that they take
[33:59] Elijah and they'd have Elijah to
[34:01] introduce Jesus which is right all right
[34:06] and have it to come to that point of the
[34:09] introducing of Jesus and they knew that
[34:12] melikhaya had a split part about it
[34:14] because it says turn the hearts of the
[34:16] father's to the children and then said
[34:19] then the children to the father's so
[34:22] that's two things
[34:23] all right see now we could follow that
[34:26] and study in the scripture so instead of
[34:29] get when you know we couldn't figure out
[34:30] about how it was to be five comings of
[34:32] Elijah we didn't have all of that
[34:34] figured out we couldn't understand all
[34:36] of those things we could just understand
[34:38] a comparison between this and this to
[34:41] see and to see that the voice of one
[34:44] crying in the wilderness would be John
[34:48] the Baptist to introduce the Messiah
[34:52] alright because that was his job you
[34:54] remember Stan after behold the lamb of
[34:56] god it takes away the sin in the world
[34:58] he came to introduce the Messiah and you
[35:01] know that was his full message come on
[35:09] John never preached no a whole lot of
[35:11] messages all John Don was introduced to
[35:17] the Messiah maybe we're missing the
[35:24] spirit and the power of Elijah test a
[35:27] little bit to understand him because
[35:29] we're afraid to use it
[35:32] we're afraid to step up and say this is
[35:35] that to get to point John's message was
[35:44] to introduce the Messiah right so he
[35:51] says behold the lamb of God the taken
[35:53] whether Senate work they asked him said
[35:55] who are you are you this are you that
[35:58] are you Elijah he said no now watch him
[36:01] cuz if he just said he was Elijah then
[36:03] where would the other four fall so we
[36:06] couldn't do that he had to say no he
[36:09] said I'm not the Elijah alright they
[36:14] said well who are you then he said I'm
[36:16] the voice of one crying in the
[36:18] wilderness which that was Isaiah 40
[36:22] right so he declared himself to be in
[36:27] the word right he declared himself to be
[36:34] and what he was come to do was to
[36:36] introduce the Messiah okay now once he
[36:41] introduced the Messiah he was off the
[36:44] scene right now where is your turning
[36:52] the hearts of the children the father's
[36:56] to the children because the lodge is
[37:02] supposed to do that John the Baptist
[37:04] Elijah
[37:05] spirit and power of Elijah according to
[37:07] Malachi 4 we'll read that in a minute
[37:09] right we read it enough to in order to
[37:11] be enough if I want to pull up number
[37:14] one that's number one on the list
[37:16] do we really read the scriptures and
[37:18] follow it or do we just read what we
[37:21] want our
[37:22] we heard somebody else say run so what
[37:27] does it say behold I send you Elijah the
[37:31] Prophet before the coming of the Great
[37:33] and dreadful day of the Lord okay that
[37:36] means it's going to be a long time
[37:39] before the coming of the Lord and what
[37:41] and he shall turn the heart of the
[37:44] father's to the children and all you
[37:51] hear about that is that he turned the
[37:55] Old Testament to the New Testament
[37:58] alright that's good well what do you
[38:01] mean
[38:09] and mustard John how to do with turning
[38:12] oh we can find as he introduced the
[38:21] Messiah don't misunderstand me now and
[38:26] get it in the right order I'm trying to
[38:28] make a point that to me would be very
[38:31] valuable if you'd listen to it it's like
[38:34] I've told you the other day I mentioned
[38:35] that the sister said you said you held
[38:38] that said how could you hold it we'll
[38:42] see I hold a lot of things because maybe
[38:47] they're not important to you I don't
[38:50] know but I choose to bring them at
[38:55] specific times not to try to be anything
[39:00] of myself but to know and understand
[39:04] that we were supposed to study the word
[39:07] I mean I'm not joking me telling you or
[39:12] trying to make anything out of my
[39:14] ministry or live or whatever then ain't
[39:16] got nothing to do with it I wish you'd
[39:18] place all that aside and just believe
[39:20] and listen to see what God has to bring
[39:23] to us because I'm gonna ask you a few
[39:26] questions and let's see what your answer
[39:28] is
[39:31] see when I said it I saw that that's
[39:33] what I asked I told my wife that would
[39:36] have been 19 and 58 right about there
[39:41] cuz we got married in 58 and I joined
[39:45] the Baptist Church somewhere in the 58
[39:47] cuz it was after we were married
[39:50] alright so we got married in August it
[39:54] may have been 59 alright okay the point
[39:58] is I told her that because I could read
[40:00] God's Word and see that if Malachi 3 we
[40:06] could follow a little bit of it but to
[40:09] see Malachi 4 the only thing we could do
[40:13] with Malachi 4 was to pick out that John
[40:16] the Baptist see we taught this in the
[40:18] Baptist Church where words everybody add
[40:20] you don't hear anybody talking about
[40:22] what they
[40:23] before oh we're so wrong I was wrong a
[40:27] lot of times there's a lot of things we
[40:28] had robbed because we knew Melek aisle
[40:34] three would to be fall on John the
[40:39] Baptist and we could move it over into
[40:42] Malachi 4 and pick up the first part of
[40:46] Melek I floor and make it fall over to
[40:51] the coming of John the Baptist
[40:57] all right then when it did we could
[41:01] follow the scripture we could follow the
[41:08] scripture if you ever talked to a
[41:11] Baptist or anything like that to try to
[41:13] define some of those things they would
[41:15] immediately take you they would
[41:17] immediately define to you that John the
[41:20] Baptist his important part was to
[41:23] introduce the Messiah he didn't come
[41:28] preaching great long lengthy messages
[41:30] and having things he never had one sign
[41:35] not one miracle is recorded under John
[41:40] the Baptist but we could immediately go
[41:46] down so Paul you know what they don't
[41:48] have it but we could immediately go to
[41:51] this scripture and define John the
[41:56] Baptist as having a job
[42:02] Luke 1:15 talking of John oh no I
[42:08] thought they pulled it up so they're
[42:10] good on it they don't have to do that
[42:12] but in yeah speaking of John the Baptist
[42:17] says for he shall be great in the sight
[42:21] of the Lord and shall drink neither wine
[42:25] nor strong drink and he shall be filled
[42:29] with the Holy Ghost even from his
[42:32] mother's womb all right we want to go
[42:35] with that
[42:36] right and look what it says and many of
[42:41] the children of Israel shall he turn to
[42:46] the Lord their God then we read the
[42:56] scriptures many other children of Israel
[42:59] he still turned to the Lord their God
[43:02] then once and he shall go before him
[43:06] Christ right in the spirit and power of
[43:11] Elijah this is John the Baptist now to
[43:16] turn the hearts of the father's to the
[43:19] children that's exactly the first half
[43:23] of Malachi 4 go to turn the hearts of
[43:28] the fathers to the children the Old
[43:30] Testament site to the New Testament
[43:32] don't ask you one question
[43:35] how many people did John the Baptist
[43:39] turned to the New Testament message he
[43:51] didn't turn all Israel call all Israel
[43:53] rejected all Israel rejected as a whole
[44:00] rejected John the Baptist crucified him
[44:04] right listen
[44:12] are you listening this is simply cut
[44:15] them computer brains off put them on
[44:17] hold and say ah what is this guy talking
[44:20] about now you stand up and you tell me
[44:23] how many converts John the Baptist hat
[44:31] you'll find this too few
[44:33] we couldn't name him off we could get to
[44:36] it there's just a few though because
[44:38] John had his converts and they went to
[44:40] John you remember to iron the scripture
[44:42] and they said John you know this we
[44:45] found this man over here and John says
[44:47] there he is you go follow him maybe two
[44:51] or three of them how many did John turn
[44:54] to the Lord Jesus maybe one or two other
[45:00] disciples was in the group but he never
[45:06] turned Israel Israel never got turned to
[45:15] the New Testament message there's a long
[45:22] gap between John and the New Testament
[45:26] message at least three and a half years
[45:32] you know pretty maybe okay if you don't
[45:37] get technicals see that's why I love the
[45:42] word I love it because you can't argue
[45:47] the word you can argue with me in my
[45:50] thoughts all you want to but when that
[45:52] word is there you can argue I'll just
[45:54] ask you a simple question because that's
[45:56] what it says and many of the children of
[45:58] Israel shall he turn to the Lord their
[46:03] God
[46:05] now how many did he turn
[46:15] should have relative because it names
[46:16] him in there of John's disciples he had
[46:19] disciples they were following him and
[46:21] two or three of them it lists them in
[46:24] the scriptures as being turned over as
[46:27] John says follow him right turning them
[46:33] over to that okay and he shall go before
[46:38] him in the spirit and power of Elijah
[46:40] Elijah to turn the hearts of the
[46:43] father's to the children I now ask the
[46:49] good Baptist this one and he's daughter
[46:51] immediately gonna tell you the next
[46:53] stage and the disobedient to the wisdom
[47:01] of the just to make ready that people
[47:05] ready people prepared for the Lord you
[47:11] come to introduce the Messiah now what
[47:15] does Malachi 4 say turn the hearts of
[47:17] the father's to the children
[47:20] Luke 1:16 says that's what John was to
[47:24] do you ask the good Baptist say well
[47:32] what about the life part of that to turn
[47:36] the hearts of the children to the
[47:38] father's they say John turned the
[47:42] fathers of the Old Testament the
[47:45] father's to the New Testament message
[47:49] and then they'll put it down till you
[47:52] tell you that John the Baptist turned
[47:55] them back now how did he what did he do
[47:56] because of this description and the
[47:59] disobedience he he turned them this way
[48:03] and they say he turned them that way you
[48:09] know what that would do that a turn that
[48:12] would be John turning into the New
[48:14] Testament message and immediately turned
[48:16] them back to the Old Testament talk to
[48:20] people this message have very few people
[48:22] even understand that I'm sorry it's just
[48:26] truthful
[48:28] I'm warning you to see the scriptures
[48:31] and how they unfold and make such a
[48:33] marvelous beautiful picture if we can
[48:36] see it unfold and you can see that all
[48:40] the way down through there I had
[48:42] understanding of things to see to try to
[48:46] get few to see because how many converts
[48:52] did John have just a few and all he
[48:59] could do was turn them to Jesus
[49:09] now watch then what did Jesus did once
[49:18] John turns to behold the lamb of God it
[49:20] takes away the sin of the world now
[49:24] what's the listen listen to the rest of
[49:26] the message now John goes off the same
[49:33] Jesus comes on the scene Jesus preaches
[49:37] for three and a half years and has 12
[49:40] converts and one of them is Judas right
[49:49] come on he had a whole lot more but they
[49:52] left him where were they out
[49:55] come on the best you can do is even
[49:59] after the death burial and resurrection
[50:01] of the Lord Jesus the Bible said he was
[50:04] seen of 500 brethren reward to 380 go
[50:09] because took 10 days later the Upper
[50:13] Room experience or some worth a few days
[50:14] later of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[50:16] can come on 120 500 and CD master is
[50:21] raised and didn't believe it he didn't
[50:32] turn their hearts back but listen to
[50:39] what I'm saying what was John turning
[50:41] what was John's message to introduce the
[50:46] Messiah it was not a preacher doctrine
[50:54] he preached nothing he just pointed him
[51:00] out and that was a fulfillment of
[51:05] Malachi 4 as the first part to turn the
[51:09] hearts of the father's to the children
[51:21] for three and a half years the Lord
[51:25] Jesus preached the gospel of the kingdom
[51:31] wound up with a - with a dozen converts
[51:36] to walk with him at that time and one of
[51:38] them was Judas and that's pretty bad and
[51:40] showing you the devil can go along with
[51:42] a lot of things I mean it converts to
[51:49] Jesus get 120 out of all of it is all
[51:55] you can come up with but you know what
[52:03] during that hunter during that three and
[52:05] a half years it only got at the end of
[52:12] the ministry of the Lord Jesus in the
[52:16] Book of Luke when the two was on their
[52:20] way to Emmaus and he talked with him and
[52:25] was made known unto them by the breaking
[52:27] of bread they turn around that's after
[52:31] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus right
[52:33] they're going they turn around and they
[52:36] run back to Jerusalem to find the others
[52:40] the others are what eleven of them ten
[52:43] nine of them then and they get back
[52:50] there and they say in Luke now that he
[52:57] was made known in the breaking of the
[52:58] bread and said think these two times in
[53:02] the Luke are together and says he opened
[53:06] our understanding of the scriptures
[53:11] right they come back to Jerusalem get
[53:15] together with the others may have gained
[53:18] two or three people by the end I'm not
[53:19] arguing with you I'm just trying to
[53:22] preach to get you to see to see the
[53:24] small amount then maybe you will realize
[53:27] one day that fear not little flock
[53:35] but when they come back and jesus walks
[53:39] among them after the two from Emmaus
[53:43] gets back together with the other and
[53:46] they're in a little group and Jesus
[53:49] walked among them and they see him and
[53:52] understand and the Bible says he opened
[53:57] their understanding of the scriptures
[54:04] I'm trying to prove a little point to
[54:06] you if you'll think about it you'll
[54:08] listen to it and consider it for later
[54:10] then you'll see why that when the
[54:12] disciples were born again they didn't
[54:16] just start down here they were already
[54:17] up here brotherly kindness because he
[54:20] opened their understanding of the
[54:23] Scriptures he declared what is that
[54:26] other one or the Prophet don't blaspheme
[54:31] his name born by the breath of God and
[54:35] how that Jesus breathed on them there in
[54:38] the scriptures and said receive you the
[54:40] Holy Ghost they didn't get it then did
[54:42] they didn't get it right then right
[54:45] that's where we can take it and make it
[54:47] say what we want to you can make it so
[54:49] without is he opens our understanding of
[54:53] the scriptures and here it says he
[54:55] breathed on them and said receive you
[54:57] the Holy Ghost the Prophet said they
[55:00] didn't get it
[55:03] he said it was a promise I'm because
[55:07] Jesus Christ had not died yet he gathers
[55:11] with them listen then now you come to
[55:16] the book of Acts he gathers whether Mary
[55:19] you know just prior he opens their
[55:20] understanding of the scriptures he does
[55:23] all of the things to him anything has to
[55:24] go away and they're still standing there
[55:27] saying are you gonna return the kingdom
[55:28] to Israel at this time he says not for
[55:31] you to know that just that's gone go
[55:33] back to Jerusalem and wait I'll come
[55:35] back and everything you'll understand
[55:38] everything
[55:44] now my point okay
[55:52] point point means stop think for this a
[55:56] little bit so home computers and listen
[55:59] for a min don't try to figure out what
[56:01] I'm saying just listen
[56:08] the third coming of Elijah for John the
[56:11] Baptist he introduced the Messiah and
[56:19] went off the scene he's not seen no more
[56:23] the rest of the story the disciples are
[56:29] turned to the Lord Jesus some that were
[56:33] John's disciples were turned to the Lord
[56:37] Jesus then the Lord Jesus started the
[56:43] message of the kingdom of the new birth
[56:47] the things that would take place what
[56:50] would happen but just remember my point
[56:54] Jesus had one had 12 John may have had
[56:59] three or four Jesus had twelve that's
[57:02] all you're dealing with it's not
[57:07] covering when it says turn the hearts of
[57:09] the fathers to the children
[57:12] it's not the Old Testament being turned
[57:14] to the New Testament message it's a
[57:18] handful of people that are being turned
[57:23] and it took Jesus three and a half years
[57:27] of preaching to them the kingdom until
[57:31] they finally begin to understand and say
[57:33] now we understand that nobody has to
[57:35] teach you we're finally getting to
[57:40] understand what you're talking about
[57:41] he said okay you're understanding what
[57:43] I'm talking about now let me tell you I
[57:45] got to die I've got to die now and come
[57:51] back in you because you can't do it what
[57:53] you got
[57:58] they could even approach him after the
[58:01] resurrection to say we went through the
[58:03] fact of our understanding being opened
[58:05] we went through the fact that you prayed
[58:07] on us and told us he said but you're
[58:08] still not right go to Jerusalem and wait
[58:17] what are you getting at I'm getting at
[58:21] one thing when was the church turn on
[58:29] the point from the fathers to the
[58:33] children when did that take place the
[58:49] disciples went through all of the things
[58:51] that they were doing but they're still
[58:53] not turned back they're following the
[58:59] best they can do they're walking in the
[59:01] best they can do they're saying we
[59:02] believe it he opened their understanding
[59:04] to the scripture he breathed on
[59:06] everything but they still couldn't talk
[59:09] about any faith that they had because
[59:13] they had none they had at that point a
[59:18] mental concept or faith for the time
[59:23] even the best it could be done of their
[59:25] understanding being opened by the Lord
[59:27] Jesus they were still faced for the time
[59:29] because the Holy Ghost had not been
[59:30] given now we come to acts 2 the best
[59:40] could happen then out of it
[59:45] best that could be proud of the kingdom
[59:47] from the time the Lord Jesus started to
[59:50] the finish was play of one of them being
[59:53] the devil he dies what happens there's
[1:00:03] 120 in the upper room so they came to
[1:00:06] the ground right they gained a little
[1:00:10] ground the disciples begin to gain a
[1:00:12] little ground
[1:00:13] I wish you'd listen to that for a minute
[1:00:16] and think about it Jesus got John gotta
[1:00:22] we'll say five distance a number Jesus
[1:00:26] got 12 and there's 120 sitting in the
[1:00:32] upper room it's beginning to increase
[1:00:37] all right the Holy Ghost falls on the
[1:00:42] 120 they received the new birth they had
[1:00:50] been taught and tutored so they didn't
[1:00:52] have to start if babies they'd been
[1:00:54] taught and tutored the Holy Ghost could
[1:00:56] fall on them where it says Holy Spirit
[1:00:58] right here
[1:00:59] see we're gonna get to where the Prophet
[1:01:01] made a statement
[1:01:02] maybe this evening you come all this way
[1:01:05] they ain't got holy God we're gonna try
[1:01:11] to put together some thoughts and ideas
[1:01:13] but this is the injected messages I want
[1:01:15] you to look out if you ask most people
[1:01:19] what happened well John come to
[1:01:21] introduce through Jesus
[1:01:30] it was the heart of the children you
[1:01:33] know the fathers turned to the children
[1:01:38] John introduced the Messiah but who
[1:01:46] opened the door to the church
[1:01:59] the Lord Jesus told him to go to
[1:02:02] Jerusalem and wait they waited till the
[1:02:04] Holy Ghost fell on them 120 of them
[1:02:22] 120 they went outside because they
[1:02:25] received the Holy Ghost got a new birth
[1:02:28] they were put in the body of Christ and
[1:02:31] Peter was far enough to be the spokesman
[1:02:39] because I never read your Bible you want
[1:02:47] to read it sometime go read about the
[1:02:50] Holy Ghost falling on the dead Pentecost
[1:02:52] in 120 you know and get that but we just
[1:02:54] blanked that out and jump over and here
[1:02:57] we go who did the 3000 outside later
[1:03:07] receive the word from not the Lord Jesus
[1:03:18] see when the Holy Ghost fell on Peter he
[1:03:21] could tell them what the new birth was
[1:03:26] he could tell them then what Jesus had
[1:03:29] spoke and said to Nicodemus you must be
[1:03:35] born again Peter could start following
[1:03:39] the scriptures and exhorting upon the
[1:03:44] Scriptures come on you didn't never read
[1:03:47] between there's a little faster
[1:03:49] difference between acts one and the Holy
[1:03:53] Ghost falling one through four and two
[1:03:58] 36 37 38 before the Holy Ghost follows
[1:04:02] on the 3,000
[1:04:14] wait a minute cuz we can own tax to it
[1:04:16] you know but you remember acts 1 that's
[1:04:20] where the Holy Ghost fell that's
[1:04:22] according to the Bible now and once they
[1:04:27] go outside Peter preaches a message that
[1:04:33] takes I forgot how many verses probably
[1:04:36] about 30 verses between the point of the
[1:04:40] Holy Ghost when they ask him what must
[1:04:43] we do to be saved he preaches them a
[1:04:48] sermon I thought John the Baptist was
[1:04:56] the one to introduce the Messiah there
[1:05:02] must be more to be done - about
[1:05:04] introducing the Messiah then then we
[1:05:08] consider what if you just take what he
[1:05:12] done have introduced immediate said
[1:05:13] behold the lamb of God that takes away
[1:05:15] the sin of the world
[1:05:19] he's got three or four converts it goes
[1:05:21] along with him how did that 3,000 hear
[1:05:28] the word the disciples were taught three
[1:05:33] and a half years come on I
[1:05:35] mathematically count with you - there's
[1:05:37] 12 of them and one of them was the devil
[1:05:40] so we take that out in these eleven so
[1:05:43] that 11 they had to be others that were
[1:05:46] close in relation because once they get
[1:05:50] to the upper room you've got 120 right
[1:05:53] and we hit you mathematics now it went
[1:05:57] from 11 to 120 Peter is the spokesman
[1:06:05] for the 120 come on read Acts
[1:06:15] Peter starts proclaiming who this was he
[1:06:23] starts describing what had taken place
[1:06:28] he doesn't use technically words of John
[1:06:32] you know his name or whatever maybe in
[1:06:36] that way but he describes what has taken
[1:06:38] place the God had promised in his word
[1:06:43] the voice of one crying in the
[1:06:48] wilderness he promised that in the word
[1:06:53] he promised in Malachi 4 that John the
[1:06:59] Baptist would come and turn the hearts
[1:07:00] of the father's to the New Testament
[1:07:04] message Church and now it walks the Lord
[1:07:10] Jesus the Lord Jesus spend all of that
[1:07:19] time and finally opens their
[1:07:21] understanding of the Scriptures then the
[1:07:24] Holy Ghost follows they don't come
[1:07:31] stumbling out of the upper room and down
[1:07:33] to earth or other people are at and said
[1:07:34] we don't know what's going on we're
[1:07:37] didn't well they would have said there's
[1:07:38] drunk they come out of our praise in God
[1:07:45] glory hallelujah something's taking
[1:07:47] place
[1:07:48] and they looked at Peter and Peter stand
[1:07:53] up he's the spokesman what one said the
[1:07:56] other stood up with him well I will give
[1:07:58] it that away
[1:08:00] that'll be ten of them standing up they
[1:08:02] done pulled Matthias in with the time he
[1:08:04] comes down from here go over here making
[1:08:07] it back to the eleven that was with him
[1:08:09] and Peter being making it 12 and here he
[1:08:13] comes out and declares read your Bible
[1:08:17] read the entire how many of you he's
[1:08:19] ever read and really comprehended acts 1
[1:08:25] read
[1:08:27] one these are coming to the Holy Ghost
[1:08:33] is way over in acts 2 acts 1 Peter
[1:08:36] describing what has taken place
[1:08:40] he said God promised that to take place
[1:08:43] God has said this would be here and John
[1:08:46] came to start it the force of one crying
[1:08:49] in the wilderness and he's the spirit in
[1:08:51] the power of alas to the fulfilling of
[1:08:55] Malachi for the first part that route
[1:09:04] the Messiah into understanding then you
[1:09:12] kind of long ways before they're putting
[1:09:15] us on come to pison today said god i
[1:09:18] pour out my spirit actually what happens
[1:09:20] between acts 1 you wind up being enjoy
[1:09:27] acts 1 and 2 throws you back to jaw what
[1:09:30] the promise and all of the coming of the
[1:09:34] Messiah the end time I'm trying to give
[1:09:39] you to look at something seriously for a
[1:09:41] moment instead of just taking up hazard
[1:09:43] lis what somebody says somebody else a
[1:09:45] or John the batteries he turned to
[1:09:47] children back to the faith and the
[1:09:49] fathers well weren't he get to fight for
[1:09:51] the father
[1:09:51] where's John's message the soul you're
[1:09:59] sarcastic no you show me John's message
[1:10:05] John's message was to introduce the
[1:10:07] Messiah the Lord Jesus the Messiah
[1:10:15] stepped on the scene and brought forth
[1:10:19] the Word of God then here comes twelve
[1:10:27] one of them drops off they get another
[1:10:30] one and first thing you know they're
[1:10:33] asking them it was not John the Baptist
[1:10:38] preaching to the 3,000 it
[1:10:40] not the Lord Jesus preaching to the
[1:10:43] 3,000 it was Peter come on it was Peter
[1:10:52] the man that preached this message it
[1:11:00] was Peter that began to preach that is
[1:11:02] your faith of the fathers John's not the
[1:11:05] face of the fathers he didn't bring a
[1:11:07] message the Lord Jesus was not the face
[1:11:12] of the father's it was the father's
[1:11:14] himself he was Garland south he wasn't
[1:11:22] coming to introduce he was coming to
[1:11:25] preach he preached the kingdom how many
[1:11:31] times you want to go through that the
[1:11:34] kingdom of heaven is at hand the kingdom
[1:11:36] is this the kingdom is that read Matthew
[1:11:39] Mark Luke and John and see how many
[1:11:40] times the Lord Jesus spoke of the
[1:11:42] kingdom because that was his message
[1:11:51] what are you getting at
[1:11:52] just keep listening so it winds up that
[1:12:01] 3,000 people are standing outside and
[1:12:04] Peter preaches the message of the true
[1:12:11] revelation of one true and living God
[1:12:15] read your Bible how he goes through it
[1:12:18] he was done this way it was a promise to
[1:12:19] come this way it was promised to be that
[1:12:21] way he's promised to be though these
[1:12:23] things that was to be in John and in
[1:12:26] acts 1 right after the Holy Ghost fail
[1:12:32] then you get to ax - you're still
[1:12:37] describing things and when you come to
[1:12:40] acts 2 that's why I've tried my best to
[1:12:45] tell you that you got to have sensible
[1:12:48] understanding of the Bible to understand
[1:12:50] it you've got to divide the day of
[1:12:53] Pentecost
[1:12:54] to have any sense of understanding of
[1:12:56] the Bible you got to divide the day of
[1:12:58] Pentecost
[1:12:59] you got to divide to say 120 in the
[1:13:02] upper room that received the Holy Ghost
[1:13:06] and they spake in town tonight cetera
[1:13:09] then they come downstairs and Peter
[1:13:14] preaches the faith of the fathers this
[1:13:20] is that the jaw spoke of Peter begins to
[1:13:27] declare the Holy Ghost and what it was
[1:13:30] and as he does they said many brethren
[1:13:33] what can we do to be saved what could
[1:13:36] happen to give us what you got
[1:13:41] he said repent everyone haven't be
[1:13:43] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:13:45] the remission of sins and you shall
[1:13:46] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[1:13:47] the promises under you under your
[1:13:49] children and for many that are far off
[1:13:50] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:13:52] call
[1:13:54] who was it preaching the faith of the
[1:13:57] fathers the father's themself Peter who
[1:14:00] was the father's not the Old Testament
[1:14:03] rabbis and in high priests and and big
[1:14:06] dudes that was not that they were not
[1:14:12] turned back to the world why it says
[1:14:17] over then Cain says many they don't say
[1:14:21] them all this is not turning the whole
[1:14:24] thing of Israel back to God that will
[1:14:27] happen after we leave out of here in
[1:14:29] rapture the God will go to Israel and
[1:14:32] they'll receive it as a national partner
[1:14:35] which we get out of here in a rapture
[1:14:39] then he's got nothing to do with us that
[1:14:41] ain't gonna cause us to do it we got to
[1:14:44] see where we're standing
[1:14:45] do you understand what is the faith of
[1:14:49] the fathers well surely in john's macy's
[1:14:52] coat in hell boy
[1:14:54] faith of the fathers is not if you want
[1:14:57] to call it that Jesus preached that
[1:14:59] kingdom right that's all right
[1:15:01] but who preached the faith of the father
[1:15:05] only
[1:15:07] after the Holy Ghost fell on 120 can you
[1:15:12] even consider
[1:15:15] millicom fury in John the Baptist and
[1:15:21] his message falling in Malachi 4 now his
[1:15:28] message is proclaimed by what Peter
[1:15:31] standing up and preaches a sermon about
[1:15:36] the Lord Jesus read acts 1 and 2 Peter
[1:15:41] preaches a message about this man
[1:15:45] because by now he's already not just a
[1:15:48] baby that don't know nothing about
[1:15:49] what's going on he hadn't just heard of
[1:15:52] half a dozen sermon order he's up here
[1:15:54] where it says Holy Spirit he's already
[1:15:57] received the Holy Ghost at a great
[1:15:59] height and understanded and he can
[1:16:03] declare and then it can be called the
[1:16:06] faith of the Father then the church can
[1:16:10] be declared to the point of showing that
[1:16:12] it can be turned if it's just the Old
[1:16:16] Testament people turn to a New Testament
[1:16:18] message you have no point because
[1:16:20] Israel's not turned only a handful only
[1:16:29] a handful which is the disciples are you
[1:16:33] listening who got turned back who is the
[1:16:39] one that the message come to who heard
[1:16:41] the three-and-a-half year sermon who
[1:16:43] heard the messages the disciples not
[1:16:49] Israel as a whole cuz they don't get it
[1:16:52] until we get out of here where's the
[1:17:00] faith in the father what is the faith of
[1:17:03] the father's we talk about turn back to
[1:17:05] the word and we talk about turn back to
[1:17:07] faith of what is the faith of the father
[1:17:15] god only used those that were originals
[1:17:19] to bring the word he never uses novices
[1:17:23] to bring the word that's where wrote
[1:17:26] around says you're wrong
[1:17:27] taking them off of a barse to play in a
[1:17:31] guitar in a juke joint and put them on
[1:17:33] the pulpit the next day preaching the
[1:17:35] gospel he said that's wrong gotta tell
[1:17:42] you they can't preach not me I'm not
[1:17:45] gonna be dumb enough to talk to you
[1:17:47] about it I'm just gonna be dumb enough
[1:17:48] to tell you don't work what's a man
[1:17:55] sitting on a barstool playing joint
[1:17:56] muted youth rock music and then covered
[1:17:59] up the next day and preaching the gospel
[1:18:00] don't tell me that's in the Bible
[1:18:02] they went 3 and 1/2 years before they
[1:18:06] were allowed to preach other than the
[1:18:09] kingdom is at hand they could preach
[1:18:11] that message Jesus told him go preach
[1:18:14] the kingdom is at hand but they knew
[1:18:17] nothing about the kingdom right the
[1:18:23] disciples knew nothing about the kid I
[1:18:25] ain't said nothing they didn't
[1:18:27] understand what Jesus was talking about
[1:18:28] about the kingdom because they finished
[1:18:31] it up saying are you going to restore to
[1:18:33] Israel the kingdom he said you don't
[1:18:38] understand in other words he's standing
[1:18:40] there crying in it hard thinking three
[1:18:42] and I have yours I hollered at these
[1:18:44] people about their and I don't know yet
[1:18:48] what I'm talking about
[1:18:50] he says don't hurry just go the upper
[1:18:53] row
[1:18:54] don't get up a ribbon wait I know you
[1:18:58] don't understand what's going on we said
[1:19:00] I'll come back and said when I come back
[1:19:03] I'll live in you then you'll be able to
[1:19:05] understand the kingdom and that's what
[1:19:08] they were faith of the father's is not
[1:19:11] the faith of John faith of the father's
[1:19:15] is not even to say faith of Jesus faith
[1:19:18] of the father's is the Apostles
[1:19:20] doctrines because that's what we're
[1:19:22] built on is that what the Bible says now
[1:19:24] come on listen to me is what I say it
[1:19:25] and this take what I say don't take it
[1:19:27] wrong the Bible said we're building the
[1:19:29] foundation of who John the Baptist and
[1:19:31] the Lord Jesus no it doesn't say that
[1:19:33] why that's involved all right but why it
[1:19:39] don't say that
[1:19:40] he said we're building on the foundation
[1:19:42] apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being
[1:19:44] the chief Cornerstone
[1:19:48] we're built on what the Apostles talked
[1:19:51] now according to my understanding now if
[1:19:54] you were listening let's review you go
[1:19:58] from John to introduce Messiah
[1:20:02] you go from dire two three and a half
[1:20:04] years you get the Holy Ghost to fall
[1:20:08] then you got 120 they're going out with
[1:20:11] a message now that Peter is the
[1:20:14] spokesman now he's telling you what's
[1:20:18] going on that's a long ways in it well
[1:20:22] we understand what is the faith of the
[1:20:29] father's I thought it was the revelation
[1:20:36] of the father I thought if we're
[1:20:38] building on the foundation apostles and
[1:20:40] prophets and everything we're supposed
[1:20:42] to have it supposed to be built on the
[1:20:43] foundation of those apostles and
[1:20:45] prophets and apostles and prophets only
[1:20:49] started their message on the day of
[1:20:50] Pentecost oh come on not in the upper
[1:20:53] room they could say this is that they
[1:20:56] could declare that God has died but when
[1:20:58] they go outside they begin to do it read
[1:21:00] your Bible that's what I'm trying to get
[1:21:02] you to do read Acts 1 and to read from
[1:21:06] the point of where the Holy Ghost falls
[1:21:07] on 120 to where he falls on the 3000 and
[1:21:14] Peters preaching them a drastic message
[1:21:16] about the coming of the Messiah the Lord
[1:21:19] Jesus Christ and then it wouldn't hold a
[1:21:27] ghost fall in at that stage on the three
[1:21:29] that I mean on 120 they already had it
[1:21:33] it was the falling of the Holy Ghost on
[1:21:36] the 3,000 that had only heard one
[1:21:38] message that's why Paul and Peter there
[1:21:43] puts us work as newborn babes desire the
[1:21:46] sincere milk of the word that we may
[1:21:48] grow thereby what did the Prophet SAV
[1:21:50] blend statue of a perfect man you're
[1:21:52] born again at faith but then you grow
[1:21:56] into these virtues and he said if you
[1:21:58] don't possess these virtues you're not
[1:22:00] sealed into the kingdom we'll get to the
[1:22:02] our this evening
[1:22:03] oh I was sealed in when I got the Holy
[1:22:05] Ghost praise God but do you understand
[1:22:08] what took place no no I'm just I'm
[1:22:14] trying my best understand what she's on
[1:22:15] right now
[1:22:16] well alright just remember if you're
[1:22:22] talking about the faith of the fathers
[1:22:24] let's talk about the faith of the father
[1:22:27] let's don't talk about the faith the
[1:22:29] John the Baptist let's don't talk about
[1:22:33] the message of John the Baptist it was
[1:22:35] to introduce the Messiah now can I cut
[1:22:37] it quick when you listen for a minute
[1:22:41] what happened in this life days supposed
[1:22:50] to be the fourth part of the coming of
[1:22:54] Elijah was that Elijah back there had
[1:22:59] Elijah that John the Baptist with the
[1:23:01] spirit in the power of allies and
[1:23:02] brother Branham comes as the end time to
[1:23:05] be the spirit in the fire of allies to
[1:23:06] be in the end time to turn the hearts of
[1:23:08] the white John turned them from the
[1:23:11] fathers to the children we had to have
[1:23:16] one to come and turn us from the
[1:23:18] children back to the fathers wented back
[1:23:22] to the faith of the fathers bring us
[1:23:27] back to the original doctrine of the
[1:23:29] Apostles they never had two or three
[1:23:33] gods they had one they never had it all
[1:23:36] messed up they had the truth Paul and
[1:23:40] them taught predestination and clarity
[1:23:42] wonderful Peter saying you must be born
[1:23:46] the completer come into being born again
[1:23:48] I've tried to get that to you to see it
[1:23:50] Paul preaching a pod option
[1:23:54] identically saying the same thing of a
[1:23:56] option a child born into the kingdom
[1:23:58] then adopted into the family and then
[1:24:01] goes forth with a signet of the Father
[1:24:03] that's the same thing as the stature of
[1:24:05] a perfect man born and again by the new
[1:24:09] birth and then baptized into the body by
[1:24:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the
[1:24:13] gift we'll get to that deceit and I made
[1:24:15] that statement life Sunday but I don't
[1:24:17] have time to clear a fight now I'll do
[1:24:20] it this evening the Lord willing
[1:24:21] why would brother brendham say I can
[1:24:23] conclusively prove that you're born
[1:24:25] again and then baptized into the body
[1:24:27] when we thought that was wrong
[1:24:30] he's right we just don't understand
[1:24:34] what's going on that's why I was
[1:24:36] bringing this message part I've run this
[1:24:38] message over run it back finally I said
[1:24:41] okay just bring it I was gonna bring the
[1:24:47] evening message and all can't do that
[1:24:49] here's what it is we say we understand
[1:24:54] faith of the father but what is the
[1:24:56] faith of the father's it's the same Holy
[1:25:01] Ghost coming and dwelling in you that
[1:25:03] was in them father's you know how hard
[1:25:08] it has been to try to preach that the
[1:25:11] Holy Ghost you have inside of you is the
[1:25:13] same Holy Ghost that came on the day of
[1:25:15] Pentecost
[1:25:16] oh now in a way not in a way if it
[1:25:23] didn't come to way it come under there
[1:25:24] Pentecost you don't have it solves a
[1:25:26] problem that's when the brother asked me
[1:25:31] years ago he said what do you think
[1:25:32] about the people about this baptism and
[1:25:34] the Holy go know I said cause a lot of
[1:25:38] people don't have it that was just
[1:25:42] honest as I could be because a lot of
[1:25:45] people would not listen to the word but
[1:25:47] will we listen to it now
[1:25:53] john the baptist's never preached a
[1:25:55] message Jesus preached a message and
[1:25:58] could not make one convert as far as his
[1:26:03] fully given him the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:05] Ghost the best he could do was send them
[1:26:10] to the Upper Room right but now you show
[1:26:15] me where the disciples I have to receive
[1:26:17] in the Holy Ghost ever told anybody to
[1:26:20] go to the upper room they said this is
[1:26:30] that they were spoken up about y'all
[1:26:36] what y'all say the whole book of Joel
[1:26:41] I'm just taking parts of it right do you
[1:26:46] see what I'm talking about what if it is
[1:26:48] folks that this spirit and power of
[1:26:51] Elijah
[1:26:54] under John the Baptist would cover him
[1:26:58] in his ministry and even the Lord Jesus
[1:27:01] and a three and a half year period and
[1:27:05] then the disciples preached the kingdom
[1:27:14] Jesus preached the kingdom was at hand
[1:27:18] the disciples never preached the kingdom
[1:27:20] was at hand they preached the kingdom
[1:27:24] now and give you that from the Prophet
[1:27:26] you want the disciples preached the
[1:27:28] kingdom why because they was in it you
[1:27:31] got to be in the kingdom be able to
[1:27:33] preach the kingdom that's why I called
[1:27:35] it over and over to you
[1:27:37] the disciples Peter and him had to be
[1:27:38] right here a Holy Spirit are they
[1:27:40] couldn't no way for us to get there Here
[1:27:46] Come a prophet in the last days to
[1:27:48] fulfill the last part he preaches for
[1:27:53] forty something years thirty something
[1:27:55] and what and he preaches
[1:28:00] the original faith of the fathers may
[1:28:09] I'll get you to compare it the Lord
[1:28:11] Jesus priests father John and preach the
[1:28:15] kingdom are you listening
[1:28:18] I'm trying to compare something so if
[1:28:19] you listen to be real good if you don't
[1:28:20] it's gonna go through the aood Jesus
[1:28:24] preached became him but he couldn't get
[1:28:28] nobody into it because the Holy Ghost
[1:28:29] hadn't come yet so we had to wait until
[1:28:35] the Holy Ghost came to be able to
[1:28:36] quicken the disciples is one that really
[1:28:39] preached the kingdom we're not told in
[1:28:44] the Bible to turn us back to John the
[1:28:46] Baptist we're not to be turned back to
[1:28:51] Elias with a double portion we're not to
[1:28:54] be turned back to Elijah that begins it
[1:28:58] we're to be told of turned back to the
[1:29:01] original faith what is the original
[1:29:06] faith the Lord Jesus Christ wrote the
[1:29:10] original message what happened in this
[1:29:13] life days now hold on for a second and
[1:29:15] grasp because you're going to anyway God
[1:29:20] promised this time of a forthcoming of
[1:29:22] Elijah that he's to turn the hearts of
[1:29:26] the fathers had to come and he was to
[1:29:31] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:29:33] children in this days to turn the hearts
[1:29:34] of the children back to the original
[1:29:37] Pentecostal father's brother Branham
[1:29:43] preached 30-something years now am i
[1:29:46] quoting 30-something years before he
[1:29:50] could preach the stature of a perfect
[1:29:51] man come on you read the book and find
[1:29:54] it he said I've been on this for 33
[1:29:58] years I think it was he'd been preaching
[1:30:01] on it but he couldn't get nobody to see
[1:30:03] what he was talking about he was talking
[1:30:06] about the original faith of the fathers
[1:30:08] of the Upper Room with a hundred and
[1:30:11] twenty not there three thousand people
[1:30:13] side because they only heard one message
[1:30:15] and they had to hear that from the
[1:30:17] Apostles brother branham was a prophet
[1:30:22] that God brought his message straight to
[1:30:24] him he didn't have to listen to somebody
[1:30:27] else God brought it to him not it he
[1:30:31] didn't listen to nobody else I didn't
[1:30:32] say that he listened to other people and
[1:30:35] he took other people in their notes from
[1:30:36] their time but he went to the backside
[1:30:40] of the desert and I don't mean the last
[1:30:41] days just for the seals and he stayed in
[1:30:44] the backside of the desert getting the
[1:30:45] Word of God right sitting by itself up
[1:30:49] in a cave in the mountains getting the
[1:30:52] Word of God but he preached the faith of
[1:30:55] the father's a statue of a perfect man
[1:31:02] compare that to the Lord Jesus preaching
[1:31:06] for three and a half years and you got
[1:31:08] something you got him bringing a message
[1:31:12] that identically compares to the Lord
[1:31:15] Jesus Christ
[1:31:16] I said message I didn't say person and
[1:31:21] personalities and ideas or concepts
[1:31:24] I said message Jesus preached the
[1:31:27] kingdom brother Branham preached the
[1:31:29] kingdom not that it's at hand but it is
[1:31:34] here he said I'm not saying he's coming
[1:31:37] I'm saying he's here all right man just
[1:31:41] been to him well still true man just
[1:31:46] bend the only one but it's still true so
[1:31:56] if that come
[1:31:57] let's compare one more you ready let's
[1:32:04] compare one more thought John couldn't
[1:32:09] bring the message Jesus the best he
[1:32:11] could do was preach the gospel of the
[1:32:14] kingdom about the kingdom he couldn't
[1:32:17] bring it into manifestation because he's
[1:32:19] gonna have to die to do that all this is
[1:32:22] these things is under John the Baptist
[1:32:24] Jesus is still under John the Baptist
[1:32:27] because he introduced him the kingdom he
[1:32:30] introduced not just a man he said behold
[1:32:34] the lamb of God not a man behold God
[1:32:38] Himself is standing among us and someone
[1:32:45] said what do we do he said go with him
[1:32:47] that was the best could be done whether
[1:32:50] the disciples go with him Richi Bible
[1:32:53] you see that's what they've done they
[1:32:56] followed him then he went to their
[1:33:00] disciples and he began as to opening
[1:33:04] their understanding of the scriptures
[1:33:05] and as he did the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:33:07] them in the upper room 120 of them they
[1:33:11] were filled with the Holy Ghost up to
[1:33:17] where the Prophet said holy spirit we'll
[1:33:20] get to that this evening we got a little
[1:33:21] more a little more the wind to where you
[1:33:25] can understand what is the baptism with
[1:33:29] the holy God
[1:33:35] what you see in the end time you had
[1:33:39] brother branham to come to bring the
[1:33:40] message okay are you going to compare
[1:33:43] with me will you compare one more thing
[1:33:48] the Lord Jesus listen the Lord Jesus
[1:33:54] went away and came back to live in the
[1:33:58] apostles to bring the message
[1:34:03] I thought we believed the new birth was
[1:34:07] to bring Christ to each individual I
[1:34:10] thought we had no right to being up in
[1:34:12] the pulpit preaching without the baptism
[1:34:15] when the Holy Ghost etcetera etcetera
[1:34:21] didn't it odd that brother Branham in
[1:34:24] the statue of a perfect man says fill me
[1:34:27] up Lord with these things faith virtue
[1:34:29] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[1:34:30] brother that I may teach others apostles
[1:34:34] prophets teachers evangelists to the
[1:34:38] bringing of these things into perfection
[1:34:42] and the coming of the Lord
[1:34:51] do we think Oh John was just that little
[1:34:56] part back there he just turned him when
[1:34:59] John turned that he said behold the lamb
[1:35:01] of God right when brother Branham comes
[1:35:06] over here and gets it what does he say
[1:35:08] he said behold the lamb of God the same
[1:35:12] one standing here today did he say it on
[1:35:15] the seal book and by quoting this
[1:35:18] correctly he said here stands a lamb
[1:35:20] with a book in his hand first seal and
[1:35:23] set out D'Argo's a white horse rider he
[1:35:25] said dar by that is the Antichrist he
[1:35:34] was standing right where John stood to
[1:35:36] introduce the Messiah okay we got that
[1:35:39] we got two message he's to introduce the
[1:35:41] Messiah what about the rest of the
[1:35:42] message now who's to carry it on from
[1:35:45] his part
[1:35:49] come on you've got a fivefold ministry
[1:35:54] if you followed what I said if you'll
[1:35:57] lay it down it'll type one right after
[1:35:59] the other one this happened this
[1:36:00] happened this happened this happened
[1:36:02] this happened this happened comparing it
[1:36:05] to the day that we're living to see what
[1:36:09] to expect what do you expect brother
[1:36:14] Dale I expect the fivefold ministry to
[1:36:19] get into the message and receive it
[1:36:20] correctly and bring it to the people and
[1:36:23] the people become the message that see
[1:36:27] we want to become the message that Jesus
[1:36:28] brought the disciples took that and
[1:36:32] brought their own message of an inward
[1:36:34] work of grace inside of their life that
[1:36:37] was the kingdom it compares perfectly to
[1:36:44] the end time and to see that God is
[1:36:49] ready to move on I believe that
[1:36:52] come on musician God is ready to move
[1:36:55] out everything is comparing if you show
[1:36:59] me anything else to compare with of what
[1:37:02] happens in Elijah and the thing I would
[1:37:05] love to talk with you but you see what
[1:37:10] I'm talking about it's going to all work
[1:37:12] up to the Word of God being made known
[1:37:17] the things that are secrets that the
[1:37:22] Prophet would state and make it's like I
[1:37:26] made it last Sunday brother Branham said
[1:37:28] I can conclusively prove that you are
[1:37:32] born again and then baptize the end of
[1:37:35] the body we look at that and say how in
[1:37:42] the world could he say it like that
[1:37:43] because that sounds like two things it
[1:37:46] is not two things if you'll get back to
[1:37:51] what happened to the disciples you'll
[1:37:53] find out it's not two things
[1:37:59] disciples received the message and it
[1:38:01] placed them in the right place we still
[1:38:06] got the brotherly kindness we ain't got
[1:38:08] there yet we still got a little message
[1:38:12] called true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:38:19] and we got to the headstone here okay
[1:38:29] oh we got come on let's damn think on
[1:38:32] these things compare it follow it look
[1:38:39] back there and see what happened John
[1:38:41] the Lord Jesus then the disciples and
[1:38:44] look over here here comes the prophet of
[1:38:46] God bringing the Word of God he's not
[1:38:48] God we're not putting that he's not God
[1:38:50] but he's the closest would be and he
[1:38:52] comes here and stands with the word in
[1:38:53] the last day and then as he begins to
[1:38:56] introduce the message it goes further
[1:38:58] than himself it goes into the Lord Jesus
[1:39:01] Christ to return in that message that
[1:39:04] he's bringing with both dyers you
[1:39:06] opening of the seals etc etc I've always
[1:39:11] talked you the headstone to the church
[1:39:12] is the opening of those seven sealed
[1:39:14] I've talked that from day one I still
[1:39:18] teach you that awake oh that's true but
[1:39:23] we can even follow the faith of the
[1:39:25] fathers go ahead well we got 51 I'm one
[1:39:29] of them
[1:39:30] anybody have a need
[1:39:32] there are people almost everywhere harsh
[1:39:37] are all aflame with a flower that fell
[1:39:40] at pinnacles that spins and may complete
[1:39:44] it is burning in within my heart Oh
[1:39:48] glory to his name I'm so glad that I can
[1:39:52] say one of the
