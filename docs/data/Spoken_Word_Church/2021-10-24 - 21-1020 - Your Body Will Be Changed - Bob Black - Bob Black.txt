lord tonight good to be back in fellowship in the middle of the week a lot of things going on lord willing will get a little rejuvenation tonight let's go uh i'm going to read tonight from mark chapter 16 and romans chapter 8 and verse 11 and before we go into the word let's just go to the author lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather together tonight around your word lord and lord everyone here lord has need of something lord we're all needing something and one thing we're all marching toward is is that body change and we need that lord lord i pray god and shall give us something to increase our faith tonight lord that we can look into your word and recognize the the power that you've given into the church and the secrets that have been revealed to us in this last day that you've given a great and mighty weapon in our hands with this word help us lord jesus that you'll strengthen us and give us encouragement lord and understanding we pray lord we open just our hearts this afternoon lord jesus as we gather here together around your word lord and invite you in to move among us lord jesus and be with us tonight lord jesus we ask in your name amen so in mark chapter 16 verses 1 and 2 it says and when the sabbath was passed mayor magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun and romans 8 11 says but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by spirit that dwelleth in you my i feel this i feel his spirit right now now you know we we come to church and we've uh many of us have been uh christians for many years and and we come to church and it's almost like uh you know you battle through things and you you go through things to to overcome things in your life and and you know first of all to be a christian and to get the new birth and you and you as you keep going on you sometimes maybe we lose sight of what the ultimate goal is and i still believe that god is going to change our bodies and and i believe that that we have we have been given in this hour the recipe of how our bodies are going to be changed maybe you look back and remember early on when you became a christian and you you were kind of probing at things and wondering how things worked and wondering why well how how do you even know whether you were born again or not whether what what what the what what the difference between all these the true and the false and all these kind of things are and then you begin to wonder well how are our bodies going to be changed is it is do we just keep marching along and all of a sudden something happens or is something that we have to have give be given some some special ability or something but i believe that the recipe for how our bodies are going to be changed is laying in the message it's laying in the bible and we've got it so i want to talk about that tonight and and kind of build up your faith to know that that your body is going to be changed if you can follow this recipe if you can get into the word and and and follow the prescription that has been outlined for us in the message now the scripture that i just read in mark chapter 16 very early in the morning the first day of the week they came under the sepulcher at the rising of the sun and then these two ladies they came to these two sisters they came to the open tomb and they looked inside and they they saw the proof that that jesus was gone you know they'd been following him for many years and and maybe they began to wonder as they saw him die on the cross wonder what is all this about and you know see see the the effects of peter uh betraying jesus and saying well i don't know him and all all that night as the events unfolded and that maybe looking around and seeing men that you had confidence in kind of fall away and uh you know think about all the ones that follow jesus ministry and then along along the way they begin to go off and and you don't see them anymore but yet here as they came to the tomb was the proof the proof that everything that they had been taught everything that they had believed in everything it was the proof of the thing and see everything everything's got to be proven out maybe that's something sometimes we kind of don't like it so much maybe maybe young people tonight you maybe you at a place in your life where you don't want to be proven out but everything's got to be proven out it's got to be proven out what you're really made of whether you're going to be a real man or not whether you're going to be a real sister or not whether you're going to be a real believer or not it's got to be proven out and you see you see even jesus had to be proven out and the proof was when he rose up from the grave it proved that everything that he everything that he said was proven brother abraham said there's many little fine little babies born and there's many man who has suffered and died for a real cause but never there never was one there never was a man even though there had been a lot of people good people in earth there was never a man that could raise himself up again until this day never a man that could raise himself so he proved what he said he said man can say things but yet it isn't exactly can be believed upon thoroughly until it's been proved to be the truth what proves what proves the message to be the truth what proves it is the quickening power of the holy ghost to come upon the word that you have believed and make it come to life you see there's got to be a time there's got to be something to prove that what you've heard and what you believed something within you to make it live something direct make it rise up from that dead denominational grave that you come out of something to make you walk and talk just like jesus and you see when it come forth from the grave that's what he came forth to prove that that same life that caused him to raise from the grave that same life has power to make you to quicken your mortal body and make you walk and talk just like he did brotherhood said he said what good would any of it do you whether you had lent or not lent if there is no life in you you see that's what it is it's the life the life is what's important it's only a memorial he said satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life you won't cup up anyhow let me pause on that for a little bit because you know when you read statements like that it doesn't satan don't care how right you are in your and then your mind begins to go places your mind begins to go places like you begin to think maybe maybe well okay it doesn't matter what i believe but i want to declare to you tonight that it does matter what you believe it matters what you stand for that's why that's why god sent us a prophet in this last day to straighten up what we believe but you got to believe it it doesn't matter it doesn't matter how much you just look at the car and polish it up and say look look at all the good stuff we got sitting over there on our shelf but you got to believe it when you believe it something will begin to happen something will spark and it will come to fruition he said no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again you see what he's saying no matter no matter how good you think no matter how good he touch you know how many how religious how everything's all polished up and it looks real good but until you have that life on the inside it doesn't matter one thing now brother burnham said he said there was a time there was a time when the world not maybe just think that as as we go through this study think about the the thought that brother brown is trying to communicate to us as he said there was a time when the world was laying in utter darkness and there was a time when you were laying in utter darkness you were going through life not knowing what what you were here for what your purpose was in life you were sinner and lost and everything and then what happened to you is the same thing that happened to the earth the same thing that happened to the earth happened to you there was a time when the world was laying in darkness it was without form and was void and it was all covered with water and was laying there in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of god moved upon that water and said let there be light in other words god spoke he spoke the word you see that's the same thing that happened to you when you were living in darkness one day you heard the word spoken it was spoke over you let there be light maybe not those exact words but you heard a preacher preaching that you need to be born again you heard a preacher preaching that you need to go to the water and be baptized and yet something down you begin to you begin to say i believe that that preacher's right i believe he knows what he's talking about they led you to the message and they began to preach and you're listening to the message tapes and you begin to listen and study and some of them begin to grow on the inside something is happening to you why because it's the word of god received into your heart the word will have an effect just like the word had an effect as it was spoken over a a world without form and void just brother brahman said the first light was ever given in the earth was god's spoken word the first light that ever struck the earth was god's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light and the spirit of god moved upon that water and said let there be light he said god had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there was seeds that he had planted and it had to have that sunlight to make it live if you think about that as god was moving over the earth without form and void he knew that there was a seed that was going to come up he knew why because it was in his mind before the foundation of the world and maybe one day you heard that word spoken over you and it was spoken and it came to life because god knew before the foundation of the world that there was a match for you in heaven you were going to come up you came into the world with that cosmic light but when you heard the word spoken over you eternal life came down and melded itself with your soul and you came alive and said and how did you come alive by the word it was spoken over you it's the word that changes you you see it's the word that's gonna make your body change it's the word is transforming you it's transforming your mind it's transforming your character it's changing you bit by bit preset by precept line upon line here a little there with little the word is what is doing it listen if his word will make the first seed come forth then it can make a predestinated son or daughter of god spring forth today it's doing the same thing that it did way back then when the world was in a formless and without without any kind of shape and all those things brother said in genesis the first time the sun rose in genesis he was bringing it was bringing a message you think about the sun rising up to bring a message the sun was coming up to bring a message that there will be life upon the earth mortal life mortal life but on easter morning on resurrection morning the s.o.n had risen to bring eternal life to all god's promised seed that by foreknowledge he had seen laying upon the earth now back in genesis when that sun wrote when the sun rose and to deliver a message and christ rose on easter morning to deliver a message what kind of a message should we have tonight today the same kind of a message that there's seeds laying out their seeds that are going to come to force come forth seeds that god has stalled before the foundation of the world that are going to come to life come to life and spring up come to life and grow to maturity come to life and by that word come to a place where they'll be changed where their atoms the atoms of your flesh will be changed i'm reminded of that parable that jesus taught he taught many parables about a sower going forth and so and seed and in one parable he talks about how the seed is the word but in another in matthew 13 he said he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares of the children of the wicked one in other words in that parable he god is actually sowing individuals how is he sowing by planting the word and you by by sowing the word in your heart but he's sowing individuals the individuals that they thought of before that foundation of the world could you just imagine that imagine that you you have a purpose and a plan for being here it's not just an accident that you're sitting here tonight but god knew before the foundation of the world that you would need something tonight maybe you would receive something tonight if you can believe it if you can believe it if you could just not just look at the tires be polished up not just look at the car laying out there the word that you have access to but believe it and you'll see god move on the scene he said it takes the s-o-n like word the word to bring them to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world listen i i maybe speak tonight on some some some some quotes and things that might have stumbled people for a long time but i i believe we've come to a place now where we can look into these things with confidence knowing what we believe knowing that we have been hearing by the word to a place where we can receive with confidence what brother madam said and listen and thinking a thinking man's field tree he said notice that word cannot deny itself there then it is satisfied or is the desire it's a desire of what what made you desire it in the first place because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed which was eternal life always laying in there always was in there what is that seed the brotherhood said in the voice of the sign he said there was a seed laying there a predestinated seed that was he said it was god's thought before the foundation of the world in other words before the foundation of the world god knew you were coming he had it prepared for you he had your mama and daddy prepared for you he had them prepared to tell you about the gospel he had the church that you go to prepared he had everything laid out for you because he knew you were coming do you realize that's the message that's the message that was proclaimed when jesus rose from the grave and that wave she fully waved over the people that there's more coming this isn't the end of the story there's more coming he knew you were coming bill graham said in works his faith expressed he said now here predestinated plan is plain view just as others see the word of god is a seed and must have the ground prepared beforehand he said if you sowed seed just throwed it out there on the ground it would do no good the birds would pick it up you throw it among thistles and thorns that'll choke it out pretty soon jesus's parable says so so the ground has to be made ready first so god and sovereign grace prepares the heart first he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age he foreknew you by his knowledge and ordained you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you that's the reason he's you staggered out of these things and staggered into what you have now it was god leading you to the place where he had ordained for you to be even when you were like the world without shapeless without form with no purpose in your life not knowing what you're supposed to be yet god knew you were coming first for the you think think about i want to really lay that down before you first heard your very first sermon before anybody told you about the gospel god knew you were coming he knew you were coming forth before you ever heard your first sermon preached he knew you were coming one day you would hear that word preached and you would receive it in your heart and that seed that predestinated seed laying there before the foundation of the world would come to life god stopped before the foundation of the world so brother brown said if god raised up jesus from the dead did he raise him up for a memorial is this resurrection morning only a one day in the year or a certain day that we celebrate this or are we benefactors of his resurrection and he asked this question what does it mean to me what does it mean to you is it a memorial where we look we look over at a grave and we say well like you know that's what a memorial is all these memorials to the veterans the vietnam veterans and all the different war war ii veterans you go and you look at a grave and you think well you remember and you think thing you think nice thoughts that's what that's what the gospel is to a lot of people but the gospel is to proclaim that jesus is not dead but he's alive listen to that same life that rose him from the grave and changed his mortal body is here tonight to quicken every fiber of your being here tonight to make you change to change you from the things of the world to take away all that depression and sin and sickness and heartache and give you a joy that passes all understanding knowing that that eternal life is on the inside of you he said the secret was made known the seal was opened to prove what kind of seal what kind of secret to prove that you're going to come up to that's the message that was preached on easter morning as he rose from the dead that you're coming up too you're coming up with him as he rose that life if you're in him if you're in him tonight that same life that was in him rose you up from the from your dead ideas and thinks brother said the seal on the sunrise was broken and the secret of life after death was revealed he said before that time we didn't know the world groped and darkness groped around banned suspicion theories was a man among man's heart tradition made up man worshipped idols they worshipped the son they worshiped all kinds of gods and all kinds of people that made claims they all went into the grave and they stayed in the grave but the real seal had been broken and one who once lived as we live died as we will die was risen from the dead what a morning he said the secret was made known that he was both resurrection and the life because he was the proof you know even in the natural you find business people want to go find a business person that that has become successful in their life and they look at that person and they go sit under their feet and they learn from them so that they can learn how to make money or how to do just in life you look at somebody that's been successful in their life that is able to raise children and able to set up a good home or whatever and you many times you want to sit under their feet and listen to the words that they have but now listen we've got what kind of example do we have we've got an example of somebody that rose from the grave that their mortal body was changed and that's why we sit at the feet of jesus and listen to his words because he proved that that the things that he talked about were true that quickening power was in him and it proved it that's why we we give everything that we have over to him we give our whole life our whole being over to him to study out these things just to yield ourselves in prayer to give ourselves holy to this one who's been proven proven to raise from the death the only one like brother baby said there's been a lot of good people that that did a lot of good things but nobody ever rose from the grave like this man and he said when he come forth on that morning because i live you'll live also he said that was the breaking of the seal because he was brought up so will everyone that's in christ be brought up with him that's the breaking of the seal because he lives i can live also because he came forth i can i can be changed also because of what he did all that power that was given to him has been given over to the church he's able to live in the church he's able to quicken he's able to quicken and change you and change your mortal bodies the seed has come to life you're rising up jesus said all those seed that was resting and brotherhood said all those seed that was resting in god's great promise was a benefactor of that resurrection to life because he raised from the dead we also have raised from the dead for we were in him now brother brown said he said now when he rose from the grave he conquered satan's trinity and what was satan's trinity that this what that was the trinity of the trinity of the devil death hail and the grave he said that was the trinity of satan being caused by one thing that was death death you go with the grave and being a sinner you go to hell and the very all the very one thing the trinity of satan which was death that had held man in captivity and all these years held man in captivity all these years and how did he break how did he break the everything that that trend the trinity of satan was doing how did he do it by bottling everything that all the deity up in one man and accomplishing the work the way brother brahm said this i don't want to stumble a little bit but the words that brother brown uses he said the true trinity of god the true trinity of god god how what what do you mean true trinity of god god being one manifested in christ who was life and had broke the seals and conquered the enemy and rose up the one true and living god god in one made man god in one made man put into flesh and dwelt among us and conquered every enemy and had proved that the trinity of satan was conquered and that the trinity of god was made known because only god alone had power to bring life back again he was that emmanuel god had been manifested in the flesh you see what a great revelation this message has brought us that god has not split up in three different people but he's in three offices manif and he was manifested in that one man manifesting the true trinity of god god and one god and one man now you see why brother brahma said would say when you've got the holy ghost you've got the father son and holy ghost in you because it's one one manifested in you and what's he doing now he's manifesting that same god the true trinity of god and the flesh of his bride today come back to manifest himself in fullness proving that he had raised from the dead brother said fear not for i am he that was dead and is alive again forevermore and i have the keys to death and hell i've already conquered it don't fear any more for every foreordained predestinated seed of god that shall come the lot shall come to life when that light spreads across the earth the glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth a crop that god ordained it to do he was quickened you see he was quickened so that you could be quickened the same life that quickened me brother brahma said the power that brought me from the grave i will send it upon you to quicken you that where i am there ye will be also he come to redeem or to bring to life those predestinated seed that god seen before the foundation of the world and put their names in the book but we need the spirit to make it live and brother brahman said we as his servants are commissioned by him to go into all the world and to bring this good news to every person that he is a living that he's a living and he said and how can we do it by word only oh goodness we're getting into some stuff that stumbles people how can we do it by word only you see we get we get taught a lot of things a lot of a lot of word is laid out and yeah i want to maybe tackle this afternoon the idea that we don't need the word well the idea that we don't need the moving of the spirit in our lives and how do you get it because brother brown lays out the plan in this message if you've got the word you've got the mechanics how do you get the dynamics and he lays it out in here he said he said i'm afraid that too many of us are not getting people to christ what is getting people to christ getting people to christ is getting people to the word see sowing that seed and then getting them to believe the things that they've heard getting them to see christ actually moving in their life not just going to church and sitting there and looking at looking at things moving looking at criticizing he said we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to christ you see the word is not something just to argue over but it's not something to argue over but to believe the word is not something to make a camp about and set up a set up a tent and camp out on your theology or your church or your membership or your theory or or your religion or all those kind of things but it's actually something to actually believe he said if the life of a man that's dead be projected in you you will live the same life he lives in other words let's not be satisfied with just knowing a lot of things but let's let's crave and let's hunger and move toward actually seeing god demonstrated in our own life actually seeing him visible in our life not just memorizing a lot of things not just knowing a lot of things in our head but actually see and be made manifest in our life what good would it do what good would it do if you packed in all kinds of information but you're still in the prison of pornography what good would it do if you've got all kinds of knowledge packed into your mind but you're still under bondage of temper tantrums and not being able to have a relationship with your wife and just bound by things of this world but god sent that quickening power into the church to change your life to quicken your mortal body he said if your spirit that's in you is wrecking dead and you are anointed with the life that was in christ is upon you that same life that insane powers them same beneficiaries that he had here on earth from god and it's not the word is not said so we can be critical of others and critical of other people many times the word will make you critical that just just hearing the the the bare mechanics because you'll look at somebody come up for healing and you'll be like well they didn't get healed i wonder why they didn't get healed maybe there's something wrong in their life or you look at you look at somebody begin to praise and you'll wonder there must be they i'm sure they don't really get it the way that they should get it and you begin to look because you've got all that knowledge heaped up on the inside and you begin to look with a critical mind towards somebody that's praising god and somebody maybe that doesn't preach the way that you think they should preach and you begin to look look but instead of looking with a critical mind in the critical eye i want to look for and expect the dynamic power of a living god believing that only only believe all things are possible to them that believe now the problem is the problem is and i i want to lay this down tonight the problem is that when the word is preached we have such a hard time actually dying out to our own ideas and we'll sit there and we'll argue it out within our own within our mind and we'll argue out and i don't know if that ministry is right and i don't know if that i don't know if what my mama and daddy are telling me is right i don't know if what people are saying is right and you are argue and argue and argue you know you can tell a lot about somebody by whether they argue with the word when the word is laid out in front of them and they argue back when a standard is put before the children and they argue back we there's a standard of holding us while we dress the way we do and why we come to church every time the doors are open and when you argue back and say why do we have to do that why do we have to come to church it shows that there's something lacking why do i need to be in the house of god every time why why why but one day when that quickening power comes upon the word that you've failed to believe up till now something will change it'll change your character it'll change you from an arguer to a believer you see what our problem is we don't die out to our own ideas if you can begin to listen i'm telling you i'm i'm telling you something real i know what i'm talking about if you tell if you can turn your soul toward the word and say maybe i was wrong maybe the things that i held down in my heart were not right maybe my mama and daddy do know what they're talking about maybe the ministers at this church do know what they're talking about and you begin to die out to your own ideas die out to your own way of thinking accept the mechanics that have been laid out before you the quickening power of dynamics will come stop arguing with the word just accept it and believe it that's i believe one of the most profound scriptures in the bible is where jesus said if you can come to me as a little child come to me as a little child just saying i believe it not arguing it out not saying well i don't understand why he would preach those things is he trying to attack somebody is he trying to come after somebody in the church but don't argue with it just believe it just accept what god has already said and believe it if we could see how simple the message really is how simple the gospel really is is when the truth is laid out before you all you got to do is believe it all you got to do is accept it and die out to your old ideas just believe what's been spoken bill brother said how did he know how did we know he was the christ because he proved what he talked about he proved it he proved it by his life he proved it by his ministry and he proved it by raising from the grave and you've got to be proven too he said how will i know the message of the hour god proves what he promised and he talks about it he said that is the identification that we are beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proves what he has talked about he proves it by making it come up off the page and live before you living where you could actually see a change in your life that once you were shapeless without form without purpose in your life and god plucked you out of the world and put a purpose in you and changed you see you're not bound by pornography you're not bound by depression you're not brown other things of the world anymore but you've been changed he said his spirit brings his same life again on the earth that same spirit by the same works by the same power by the same signs being you it'll also raise you up what he promised to do in christ he proved on the resurrection what he promised to do in the days of moses he proved it what he promised in the days of enoch he proved it in all the days of the apostles he proved it and he has still proven today how's he doing by that same resurrection power what are you talking about brother bob i'm talking about when you look at a christian life and you you can tell you look at somebody when somebody smacks them across the face or says something disagreeable that that christian life in them holds it's a manifesting of the quickening power in their life a real true saint of god that's been molded by the word have to believe that word and the quickening power has come upon that person living inside of them proving that the things that have been spoken of are true that's the kind of proof i believe in that's the kind of proof i stand for the proof of the resurrection he's still proven today and brother ram said the sun has got to be revealed again and the bride in the last day the quickening power has got to come quicken them out of these dead denominations and decrees to a living word of the living god how's it going to come how can the quickening power come it's going to come by the word by the word that we've heard by the word that's laying on our bookshelves that by the word that we've polished up all these years and now it's time to believe it now in leviticus chapter 23 verses 10 to 11 you you don't have to pull that up or anything i'm just going to preach tonight the bible says the word of god to moses will speak unto the children of israel and say unto them will you be coming to the land which i give you and shall reap the harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest under the priest and he shall wave the sheep before the lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it so if the priest was the the sheaf wave was weighed the priest would go out into the field and he'd see all that all that week coming up and a lot of wheat had not come to maturity yet so he grabbed up the first little bundle of wheat that had come to maturity and he hold it up over his head and the bible says that he'd hold it up over his head on sunday on the day that christ rose from the grave on the day that that sheath wave was waved it actually the the way that the the the day that the sheep wave was proved that it was proven he and the priest would wave it up over the people and why did he do that he waved it to show standing there in that field of all the other wheat that was coming up to prove that there's more to come that there's more coming and he waved it he was he was the first from the dead and the first to maturity hey brother i said notice it was the first corn of god's wheat that had been raised from the dead god's first corn of wheat by god's quickening power but it showed that there was more to come if you can accept that same life that was in him will raise you up waving of the sheep what was the sheaf the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was the wheat the first one that proved it was a wheat in other words you've got to be proven you've got to be proven how are you proven you got to stand like jesus did right before pilate and pilate looked him all over and he said i find i don't find the devil himself looked him all over and said i don't find no fault in you you got to go through trials and suffering and things in life to be proved out proved whether that faith that same life is dwelling inside of you and then what was he doing what what is that sheaf wave it was waving christ the word over the people that chief wave was raised as he rose it was waved on the day of pentecost brotherhood said as that rushing mighty wind waved over the people on the day of pentecost to prove that that life was coming back and it's got to be waved again in the last day to prove proof that the word is true that his power is real that there's more to come what is that chief wife it's the the word of god in this last day waved over the people and i believe that we've heard the word waved over us we've heard the gospel of daniel 70 weeks and the message of the son of man and the message of all these dispensations and the word the seals have been opened and we've heard a word waved over us and it's been waved of us to prove that there's more coming up more coming up to maturity he said the first time they will come forth for the bride age for resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there we we've seen the message waved over the people as cops were brought up before brother branham and his ministry and it showed forth that the life was in the people again it's showing forth today in this very hour that all around the world people are being healed and saved because the same quickening power under the headship of this message that we've heard has the same effect that it did when jesus rose from the grave that's why brother brown said who is the who is the son of man and the day that the son of man will be revealed or waved again over the people in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us he said if all the teaching that we have and confirmation of the word of god by word of god by signs by wonders we see today that in the book of luke here that we as we just quoted from and malachi 4 and the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that that word again is waved over the people the word again is waved over the people as the word is preached you see this message is the very proof of the resurrection this message is the proof that what he said it has an effect on your life the very effect that it has on your life is proof that christ is alive a resurrection out of dark denominationalism he said he was waved to them the word which he was was waived back to them on the day of pentecost the word made manifest wave to prove to prove the power of the risen christ is here and then he said well you say the power is in the gasoline brother but i don't care how much power is in the gasoline unless there's a spark there to manifest that power unless there's a power there to confirm that that's gasoline it just might as well be water you you see what he's saying we've got all the we've got the car built we got the all the the the son of man the doctrines we got daniel 70 weeks laying out there but something's got to bring it to life and actually make it live within us we've got we've got all the head knowledge maybe of the seven seals we've got the seven seals laying there before us and we can begin to kind of probe and understand with our ideas but something's got to make it rise to life so that it's not in symbol form anymore but it's actually a living reality the thing that has been prophesied of the thing that's been spoken of living out right before our very eyes you see that's what the son of man is the son of man is actually the word in flesh again quickened actually walking before you where you can see that same life in the flesh of the bride again the same life that was in christ that made him rise from the grave he said no matter how much theologians claim how well you got your church set how much education you got how much like the bible until that wave sheaf until the holy spirit comes upon that person to quicken that word the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move now how do we get the spirit to move though if we can crack into that secret into the key of how to get the spirit to move and you see it's so simple so simple that's why you know brother brown kept going back as he would illustrate talking about talking about abel crawling up on that altar to be identified with his sacrifice crawling up on that altar what was he doing up on that altar he was dying out dying out to his old way of thinking dying out to himself ready to recognize that what christ what what the sacrifice had done was was enough ready to believe and if you'll if you'll do the same thing tonight if you'll just believe the word that has been spoken that's what we do that's what we comb through the message looking for little nuggets we're combing through looking for that little thing that will spark our faith looking for that little sentence that brother brown said looking further something that will spark us and give us faith to ignite it this uh if we'll die and humility and contrition and come as a little child that's why young people pushing back against your parents and believing that everyone but you is wrong and rejoicing in the weeping of others and doing all those kind of things if you'll humble yourself and come and contrition believing believing maybe that you didn't have it figured out to begin with if you want to go up you got to go down if you want to go up sometimes you got to admit that you're wrong if you want to go up sometimes you've got to admit maybe that you didn't have church figured out that you didn't have the new birth figured out that there's something maybe that's lacking in your life why don't you recognize why don't you recognize tonight that maybe your parents do love you why don't you recognize recognize that maybe the preacher's right and maybe that god does want to save you recognize it that's how the dynamics come the dynamics come because the mechanics have been laid out the mechanics is god loves you but you've got to accept it you've got to believe it and if you believe it then you'll see something new you'll see god come on the scene and prove his word to you if you can recognize tonight that there is a way back brother said we put too much stress on the mechanics and i'll put i'll say this i believe the mechanics is our own ideas sometimes it's our own church ideas it's laboring over what what the greek and the hebrew is and our opinions and traditions and and even wanting to be the authority wanting to be the one that's right if we'll lay that down and say maybe maybe god maybe i'm not the one that's right maybe your word is the one that's right maybe you're the one that knows what you're talking about maybe that ministry that that it seems like a lot of people poke at and don't like too much maybe he's got something that i need we put too much stress on the mechanics the mechanics is the word though the mechanics and brother brown explains it a little bit we'll we'll get to that brother he really nails it down we put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamic if you begin to stress the dynamic in your life you'll come with humility saying oh god give me something coming in humility seeking after something coming probing through the word flipping the pages of your bible that's something that i need he said it needs the dynamic power of god the resurrection power of jesus christ upon the church to manifest and pray to bring that to pass that this is gasoline it might be in a gasoline can it could still be water seed but the only proof is the only proof of it is is the life the life on us in other words it's got to be proven that what you've held down in your heart is actually the is actually what you say it is it's got to be you say you got the new birth it's got to be proven you say you say you're living a christian life it's got to be proven and i'll say this when your kids are looking at you and you see you screaming to your spouse they're in the kitchen or whatever they know that something's wrong it's got to be proved out everybody knows whether it's proved out the devil knows whether it's right or not your kids know whether it's right or not your spouse knows whether it's right or not it's time to get serious and crave the dynamics to look for so look for the power of god in our life it might be all good that you know all the things about the message but i want to see christ live and we've got to prove we've got the wave shift to prove that there's more coming up that there's something available to you if you get serious about it in the message once more he said there's where satan got in to make it all mechanics and no dynamics back all dynamics and no mechanics see we got to put it together we've got the power of the holy spirit but we got to come back with a word you see you see what he's putting the emphasis on we got to come back with the word to feed this machine we can't feed it on creed it won't burn it it chokes up the flues and it will not burn it it was made for the word of god how do how do i let's lay this down how do i get a body change by the word of god how do i get the new birth by the word of god how am i changed by the word of god now to go from point a to point b there's a lot of things happening in there there's a lot of trials and struggles and tribulations and worrying about your kids and oh god what's going on right now in my life and problems at work and problems with your spouse and all that but it's the word of god the word of god is what's changing you there's a lot of things in there between point a and point b but it's the word of god he might take you down through the valley of the shadow of death like job but the word of god is going to change you nonetheless it's the word of god that's doing it and when you believe the word of god that has has been spoken to you the dynamics will come it's believing the word that brings the dynamics you see you see how satan does he'll get in amongst people and he'll begin to make you think that it's not the word that brings the dynamics that the dynamics comes some other way but it's the word of god that brings the dynamic power of god the problem the problem with why there's no dynamics many times is because when the word is being preached people get so cozy in their own their own ideas and they begin to fall asleep and they can begin to say well i don't want to hear what that preacher has to say or i don't i've already heard it before and they begin to get all cozy with their mechanics they get cozy and they begin to shower up maybe he said that's the easter message the dynamics and the mechanics together the the mechanics without the dynamics no good neither is the dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump and up and down all you want to and deny this word it won't do you any good you're just cranking around the pistons that's why i i was talking to somebody the other day you cannot say that because somebody jumped up and down that they got something real it's a real holy ghost but you cannot say i know that stumbles people i know that might be stumbling to you here tonight but i'm going to preach it anyway because it's the truth you cannot look at somebody and say because they saw the pillar of fire or they had a good dream or they had supernatural things in their lives that they had a real experience i'm talking about down on the inside of your soul that that word that where's the word at if all you're looking for is some kind of a some kind of a supernatural sign without the word it's got to be the word first the word first and everything and brother emma said i i'm skipping ahead in my notes but he said the evidence to the whole thing if you've really been quickened down in your on your inside of your soul it will quicken you to the word it will quicken you to the word and you will hunger and thirst after the word because that's the thing that you're living by it's the word is the evidence the word because the word quickened is alive and the word the word the whole thing is about the word you're changed by the word you're matured by the word so maybe ask this question tonight do you realize do you realize what you got in your hands do you realize what this is this is the secret to your body change this is a secret to overcoming the world it's the secret to overcoming every lie of the devil it's the secret to conquering everything that the devil throws at you it's laying in your hand maybe laying on yourself it's laying here if we'll just accept it but i said i'm so glad that there is a 10 000 octane power the word of god and a holy ghost to light it up and to resurrect the power of god into a man's life or a woman's life or enter a church now i believe that i believe that there is a quickening power that can take the word believed and make it come alive in your life that will as you actually resurrect it in your life that same resurrection power will make it live that's what the gospel message is that christ is not dead but he's alive and you think about what we've been given this day the word has been poured out well we have we can see the whole thing the whole thing from cover to cover which is why brother graham said there's been churches churches brides brides churches brides brides but there's got to come one there has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it makes that church leave moving the power of his resurrection how how we're going to get there we've got the mechanics we've got all the capstone teaching we've got all this message that brother branham brought to us the seals have been opened up and it's been preached but if we'll believe it if we'll take it into our heart and believe that the things that have been spoken are not just some theology not just something to look at and marvel at and say wow look how much i know and look how much i know more than the other person and build ourselves up in our own mind but if we'll humble ourselves and just take god's word as it's been presented a bride with the full word that believes the word that god vindicates with his quickening spirit manifesting his fullness in flesh that's the son of man that's the son of man god back in flesh walking and talking and doing he said that's what he proved he wasn't only the word but he was god himself the dynamics in the word that made the body of jesus christ cold stiff and dead in the grave shaking the life and rise again and roll away the stone i am he that was dead so dead to the son said he was dead the moon said he was dead the star said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he's not only he was not only the mechanics god's word he was the dynamics to prove it why does the whole world have to recognize it because the whole world's got to recognize when they see christ moving at his bride to see signs and wonders done to see healings wrought to see god living again and preached in the power and demonstration of his spirit not just some theological theology of of what martin luther and john wesley preached with a little angry thing things that needed to be tidied up but the word and this power the word back in its fullness again the bible says these signs shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics this is what brother graham said the dynamics will take its place let me let me skip through my notes here a little bit to see so we can stay stay with the clock i hate i don't like the clock listen he said your temp your body is the temple of the dynamics why now he's going back to the seed for because from the beginning from the beginning you're part of the mechanics what what kind of mechanics you're part of the word you're part of in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and you were part of that word way back in the beginning and part of that genesis 1 26 27 a man you're a part of that and now the word has been made manifest in flesh in your flesh by the word because the word believed will make the engine run the word believed is what makes the engine run and brother brown used that illustration you know you you come about on somebody on the side of the road and they're they they they their engines splutter and everything and and they're trying to maybe they're trying to start up their engine and if they put water in their engine all it does is just make it splutter he said the dynamics if it comes on water it'll just splutter somebody saying days of miracles is passed pump pump pump oh i believe the bible pump pump pump but when he hits that 1000 octane where away she goes you see how my the dynamics will strike that you see what he's saying when you if you'll believe the word something will begin to happen and he said the dynamics with the mechanics that is if he is a true eagle now he will understand he'll begin to god will begin to reveal he'll begin to reveal his word to you he said watch it was the spiritual revealed word that did it that's the reason he told them to go baptize now y'all listen if you if you've been asleep for a second just wake up just for a moment because this is how the dynamics will come and brother brown he got to talking to this this man and he got to expect he was wondering how why do some people why do you baptize in the name of the lord jesus and he said he got to explaining to him about he said now if i told you brother to go over here and sign up for our dinner in the name of the governor of the state of arizona would you go sign it like that do you think they would receive it at the desk and now listen what up the point is he had the mechanics it was laying there between the pages of his bible and he saw what it said it said go and be baptized in the name of the father son and holy ghost in matthew 28 19. and in acts 2 38 it said then peter said unto them repent and be baptized to every one of you in the name of jesus for the remission of your sins and he had the mechanics there it was laying there and he he actually agreed that it was there he said now if i told you that would you go sign it like that do you think they would receive it at the desk why he said i guess not he said why did jesus say that and he explained he went on his explanation he said when he said father son and holy ghost he knowed how they was going to baptize he they know they knowed who he was my sheep hear my voice now he had the mechanics there laying there he had it all laid out and the brother said that he was talking to he said he said oh i see brother brown said he said oh i see in other words he's he's got the mechanics there and he's now he's agreeing with it he's agree but that ain't it yet not yet and brother brown said in that you go read it in and and it is the rising of the sun he said but now the next thing will you believe will you believe now you see how simple it is for the dynamics to come the word has been laid out but will you believe and he said see he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life he that heareth my word he that hears it and then believes it and continues on believing believes then you got eternal life not not maybe that moment when you say oh i see but you keep believing until god recognizes that you believe and that quickening power will come upon that word the mechanics that you've held the mechanics that you got lay in there and it will quicken it and bring it to life the next thing will you believe when you've received this holy spirit now that they did at pentecost they were the mechanics now the dynamics had to come and he said they had believed they had believed and when they believed that that made a way for the dynamic power of god to come into their life it opened up the gate for the for the holy ghost to come and quicken the word when god recognizes your faith you see the dynamics come that's why the bible said when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place they all got in there and they began to meditate in one accord believing believing that something was going to happen believing if you can believe when you get the dynamics brother said you've been quickened from mortal to immortality it makes the whole body come subject to the word it'll make you act different look different live different it'll just make you different why because god recognized your faith that you believe the mechanics you believe the word that was laid out for you and it brought the dynamics what's the dynamics christ living in you i i almost feel like you see how simple it is how some complex sometimes we make it we make it we if i don't see the pillar of fire i don't know if we got the dynamics but if i can see christ living in his bride if i can see christ walking on two feet on your two feet i know to see god change somebody from the things of this world into somebody that he can use somebody that he can preach through to sing through be a deacon through minister through help through a little a little widow woman to help somebody with the words that come out of her mouth and the life that she lives like that woman that brother ram talked about cleaning her floor saying must jesus bear the cross bear the cross alone and her drunk husband come in and that quickening power that he observed there on the floor is what changed him he began to recognize that there was a life being lived in front of him what kind of life the same the same spirit that raised up jesus was in that little woman and the same spirit that raised up him is in you tonight if you've got the baptism of the holy ghost and what'll it do it'll take you right straight to the word because that's where you get all your nourishment from that's where you get all your strength from it's from the word he said how can you claim to have that spirit and throw yourself away from the word you're quickened by something else for it will quicken your mortal bodies to the word it'll make you love the word now these are my words it'll make you love the word it'll make you care about what you believe it'll make you care about it it'll make you want to live it why because you've been changed and brother brahma said just like a little seed coming up from the ground it's pushing up and and a seed drinks water and you've got to drink the word because you can only drink from one thing you pour oil down on that little seed one time it'll kill it you pour stagnated water or water that ain't no good it's contaminated it'll stunt the growth but you pull real good soft rain water it'll make it live which is why the bible says in isaiah incline your ear and come unto me here and your soul shall live in philippians holding forth the word of life the word is actually where you get your life from the word is what's going to change your body listen i know i'm fighting against something tonight because that's so hard for some people to argue against that it's so hard for you to come to grips that it's the word that will change you the word believed if you believe it it will change you you look around at your house maybe and you say well i don't see the effect it seems like i believe maybe you got the mechanics all piled up and you just need you just read you really need to take the book down and meditate on the word of god and get to believing because if you believe it the right way if you take the medicine the right way like brother said in the greatest battle ever fall it will have an effect if you take the medicine the way the doctor prescribed it and follow the follow the prescription it will do what it says john 5 25 says verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the god and they that hear shall live because his words are life his word is actually what will give you life my brother brown said see the dynamics come into the mechanics on the day of pentecost and he said some of you people that are afraid that some woman would laugh at you for having long hair or quit wearing makeup some of you man that's afraid your organization will throw you out when you baptize your congregation that scriptural baptism you need to close yourself in the upper room until the dynamics come what happens in that when you close yourself off you get to meditating on the word you get to believing something begins to take place your soul begins to elevate into another dimension into that dimension where all the world begins to fall away and you're you're able to believe when you close yourself in the upper room like they did on the day of pentecost and i i believe maybe that's some maybe tonight that's what we need some of is to close ourselves off away from the things of this world and get along with god so that we can see the dynamic power of god moving in our life listen some of you some of you may be that are afraid of what others think about you here tonight if you get along with god so that his dynamic power get along and begin to meditate on his word that god can change that when you're when you're afraid of taking correction when your mama and daddy tell you you need to be dressing this way you need to be clothing yourself instead of going out in the world naked showing yourself off to other men if you begin to realize that that's for your good not for your hate not for your hurt but your mama and your daddy want you one day to find a good man that will love you and raise you up in the admin to teach you the word and raise up children in the admonition of the lord the reason your mama and daddy are concerned about you is not for your hate listen someone maybe sometimes the older ones maybe they'll sweep secret sin up under the rug but if you get alone with god and let god take care of that he'll change you he'll change you so you're not ashamed to be identified with the gospel so you're not ashamed to walk behind your mama through the store or something because she's got long hair and a dress you're not ashamed to be identified with the gospel that's what the quickening power will do to you it'll make you it'll make you proud to say this is that this is that that was spoken of by the prophet joel it'll make you proud to be identified with the things that were spoken of it'll be proud to say i'm one of them i'm one of the one of that crazy group that just shouts and praises god and knows what they believe i'm one of them brother braham said when he was talking about it he said i'll show you what it is it's the scripture he said i've always said if this ain't that let me keep this till that come listen the quickening power will make you proud to say that you're a christian christian proud to be identified with that life that's come upon the word that you've believed he said what did it happen what happened on the day of pentecost he said it changed them it quickened them it made them different they were a changed people from the you see what effect it has on you it changes you it quickened them from an old life they absolutely faced martium and all those other things nailed the crosses no more cowards about them death had no victory over them at all the dynamics was in the mechanics yes sir it quickened their mortal body it's so quick in them and such what equipping their mortal body what's he talking about in this sermon he's building up your faith when you come to a place and i believe we've come to a place where we can believe that the seals have been open you come to a place where it's time for a body change you read these messages again and you'll find out he's talking about the thing that we need in this hour for our flesh to be changed that's why he's talking about it quick in their mortal body it changes your flesh and it will change your flesh your mortal body it's so quick in them they quicken their language what's he talking about he's talking about their flesh their tongue it quickened their tongue so that they were speaking different their thoughts were quickened it looked quick in your brain their spirits were quickened their life were quickened they were quickened all together they tried to talk and couldn't talk it anymore human language it'll make you do things you didn't do before because you're feasting at a fountain that the world know knows nothing about now listen he says the quickening power wasn't only in their soul it was all over them what's the stature of perfect man for to take what's in your soul and push it out push it out until all your flues are open up in your spirit push it out until you're believing the word of god push it out until it finally takes over your body pushing it out until it's all over you until like brother adam said in the statue of a perfect man you've been swallowed up swallowed up in christ that's what we're yearning for he said not only that the dynamics i can't talk not only the dynamics come in to quicken but it quickened the mechanics they were so quick until their tongues began to speak in another language they were so quick and it quickened your mortal body they were healed by laying on a hand now you think that you can quicken your mortal body so much that you can pass eternal life from one to another pat i'm talking about this the spirit the quickening spirit to heal somebody that someone can be healed because you touched them with your hand with your flesh they quickened their mortal body in their flesh resurrection from the dead brother said in the spirit quicken their fellowship together with god so they were also so quick and into the presence of god until when a person died and their soul had gone off it called him back to life again amen you see where brother graham is going in this message he's going up he's he's culminating i'm doing maybe a cliff notes tonight for you so when you go back and study this message maybe you'll read it different he's culminating with resurrection of the dead and changing your mortal body what happened on the day of pentecost is they saw the dead raised and their bodies were quickened and what is what the culmination of this message is you'll see the dead rise from the ground and your bodies will be changed first the dead in christ must rise and then we will be caught together with him to meet him in the air they laid hands on the sick they recovered they prayed and the spirit they saw vision call the dead back to life that's right quicken their mortal body the quickening power bringing the word the mind that was in christ was in you then when christ when god raised jesus from the dead he raised up you also and when a man has said that he believes the word and then when the holy spirit comes it is the abstract to the title and that gives you permission when you have that abstract that every bit of that belongs to you every bit of it and everything is on it belongs to you now enoch in the bible had a testimony and brother branham said his testimony was that i haven't failed i haven't one time failed his word you see what's going to change you it's his word enoch was walking in the word and then it was a type of you not the other way around enoch's typing you and you're going to take a body change the same way that enoch took a body changed and brother abraham said enoch got so full of quickening power when the dynamics hit him on the mechanics he didn't even have to die he just took him home he just started walking he just went i'm an old man anyhow i just got so much quickening power i'll just walk right out of the earth and brother brown said that's that same quickening power that we have right now see it will quicken your mortal body isn't that right it's the quickening power in it with that perfect testimony that everything god told me to do i did it everything that i seen he said for me do i done it everything now you you with your your walk you're going down to the water to be baptized the preacher of the pulpit said you need to be born again and and you went through the motions you've been born again the preacher of the pulpit preached the status of a perfect man to you and you've climbed and you've struggled and you've you've gone through all your life like like an ox laboring burdening going to climbing and climbing until you come and you can have that same testimony that anik did everything god told me to do i did it that's what will bring you confidence in the confidence when you're facing the hour of death and you say you say like job i know in my flesh that i will see i will see god because everything god told me to do i did it everything that i've seen he said for me to do i've done it and he said he becomes so full of mechanics until when the quickening power struck him the mechanics he just lifted him right up he walked on out of the earth into heaven you see how you do it you believe god's word and god's word is what will carry you elijah got so full of the quickening power until he seen a chariot hooked over there some horses of fire and chariots of fire hooked to some tree over there he just walked across the river and went home without even dying now hold that in your mind for a second elijah didn't die now moses moses is full of that quickening power was the brother of them said he was a prophet who the word came to and i'm i'm closing here in a minute i'm i'm winding up he was part of the word he was the word of that day is that right and after he was dead 800 years there he stood again peter james and john went up to the top of mount transfiguration and they saw elijah who never died but went up in a fiery chariot and moses who died but there he was why because that same quickening power brought him back that same quickening power had him standing up there between on another either side of jesus there on mount transfiguration what kind of quickening power the same quickening power that when elisha was dead in the ground his bones had so much quickening power when when they touched another dead man it brought into life that's the kind of quickening power we're talking here tonight there was that scene on the mount transfiguration when jesus was standing there in the middle and a voice spoke from heaven this is my beloved son hear ye him hear him and on either side of him was in type a type of the ones that had that quickening power that had died and the ones that had not died but had that quickening power and were called away that quickening power is going to bring the dead saints from the ground that quickening power is going to change somebody's body so you'll never have to taste death that quickly power that quickening power is sufficient to raise the dead saints from the ground and how are they going to raise from the ground because the word will be manifested in the life of the son of man revealed again in his bride and they will have to come from the ground because that is the resurrection sign the son of man is the resurrection that's the resurrection power is god's life man manifesting flesh again by that quickening power quickening the word that you've heard the word that you've you've heard all these years that you've held in your heart that you received the quickening power in your life to make it live that's what'll do it now the musicians go ahead and come brother said look at transfiguration we was everyone represented there there was the living saints that had raptured there was elijah standing there there stood moses the dead saints whether one died and the other didn't die they're all there he said we're just like them amen at mount transfiguration see let's stand to our feet and just worship the lord i believe we've got the secret to a body change the secret was revealed it was opened up as when christ rose from the grave and now the seals have opened up everything that we have lead to take a body change to raise the dead saints from the ground to see them come forth again can you imagine all of our dead loved ones that have gone on to maybe one day be needing bread in the kitchen or whatever and see see brother marlo come walking up the driveway see all the ones that have gone home we could go down the list of all of our loved ones and see him come maybe won't come walking down the aisles of the church one morning it's that quickening power that'll do it i believe that same quickening power is here tonight if you have need of something to set your heart set your mind on christ don't just leave the mechanics sitting up there on the shelf don't it's time to polish it off and get our heart my mind set on believing it and you'll see god do something just believe him let's sing something god said this sir they called in jesus whatever you have need of tonight he came to love you can receive it in your seat or if you need somebody to join faith with you we'll be glad to play with you he lived [Applause] [Music] yes sir that's the proof
