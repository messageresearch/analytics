[10:57] your name
[10:59] i know the other day when i didn't hear
[11:02] all the story but uh
[11:04] uh lisa and her brother was in a
[11:07] truck pulling some putting some stuff
[11:10] the other day and
[11:11] the trailer came unhooked you know
[11:14] and if they hadn't been where they were
[11:16] and all of this that and the other no
[11:17] telling how long it went that away
[11:19] you know it could have been very
[11:21] dangerous could have went out in front
[11:22] of somebody or whatever it could have
[11:23] been
[11:24] but we thank god for being there to do
[11:26] it now because
[11:27] he's he's ever present with us all right
[11:30] revelations
[11:31] 1
[11:35] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[11:37] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[11:40] things which must shortly come to pass
[11:42] and he sent and signified it by his
[11:44] angel to and to his servant john
[11:46] who by record of the word of god and the
[11:48] testimony of jesus christ and of all
[11:50] things that he
[11:51] saw thus it is he that readeth and they
[11:54] that hear the words of this prophecy
[11:56] and keep those things which are written
[11:59] they're in
[12:00] for the time is at hand now let's go
[12:03] over
[12:03] we were in chapter 4 this morning which
[12:06] in no way in the world did we
[12:08] cover anything but we were just covering
[12:10] the voice of the archangel
[12:13] you know and the the resurrection and
[12:16] things and then this afternoon we want
[12:17] to get on to
[12:18] chapter five
[12:22] and see some of the things that john saw
[12:25] all right and i saw in the right hand of
[12:28] him that said on the throne a book
[12:30] written within on the backside
[12:31] seal with seven seals and i saw a strong
[12:36] angel proclaiming with a loud voice who
[12:38] is worthy to open the book and to loose
[12:40] the seals thereof
[12:42] and no man in heaven nor in earth
[12:43] neither under the earth was able to open
[12:45] the book neither to look their own now
[12:47] brother branham in the seal book
[12:49] especially
[12:50] covers it all of the prophets the
[12:52] different sages the different people
[12:54] down through time
[12:55] were all there but nobody was worthy he
[12:58] said that the uh michael
[13:00] that he was worthy but said he wasn't a
[13:03] man
[13:04] that was christ and so in that form you
[13:06] know he said gabriel was but he wasn't
[13:09] he wasn't a man so it had to be
[13:11] something connected to man
[13:13] see because it said in verse one and no
[13:15] man in heaven nor in earth neither under
[13:17] the earth was able to open the book
[13:19] needed to look their own
[13:20] and i wept much because no man was found
[13:22] worthy to open and to read the book
[13:24] neither to look their own
[13:26] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[13:28] not behold the line
[13:30] of the tribe of judah the root of david
[13:32] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[13:34] loose the seven seals thereof
[13:36] and i be held in low in the midst of the
[13:39] throne
[13:40] and then the four beasts and then the
[13:41] midst of the elder stood a lamb as it
[13:43] had been slain
[13:45] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[13:47] are the seven spirits of god sent forth
[13:49] into all the earth
[13:51] and he came and took the book out of the
[13:53] right hand of him
[13:54] that set upon the throne you may be
[13:57] seated the lord had his
[13:58] blessing to the reading of the word
[14:03] now we we tried to cover this morning
[14:07] that i said we just
[14:08] just barely hit a little bit of the
[14:10] fourth chapter and
[14:11] you know because i'm trying to move on
[14:15] and you know and just kind of give us a
[14:18] layout
[14:20] and of what we're looking at and what's
[14:23] taking place
[14:24] you know and is to take place
[14:28] and to see all of that you know in the
[14:30] scriptures
[14:31] but i was thinking this morning as i was
[14:34] reading it
[14:35] see i try to bring something i bring a
[14:37] lot of notes
[14:38] and in these notes if you would just
[14:41] take the note and read it and then read
[14:43] the next quote the next quote the next
[14:45] quote the next quote
[14:47] i try to line them up that brother
[14:48] branham makes every point that i'm
[14:50] saying everything that i'm point i'm
[14:52] trying to make
[14:54] he makes that statement and that's where
[14:57] i get it from
[14:58] you know but hopefully you will see
[15:01] how it all lines up together and just
[15:03] let it be
[15:04] we could just take it and bring it off
[15:06] of the message you know and then turn on
[15:08] the tape recorder and let him play
[15:10] let him speak each one of them because
[15:12] that's what's happening
[15:13] amen now did you understand what i'm
[15:15] talking about this morning now that the
[15:17] uh the voice of the archangel how
[15:21] that voice of the arctic angel is christ
[15:24] and michael the scripture calling him
[15:26] the archangel
[15:27] we know is christ now not jesus
[15:31] because that's the you're putting in the
[15:33] wrong place
[15:34] but the christ thing all right
[15:38] and the christ is the son of the living
[15:40] god
[15:42] okay jesus was the man on earth
[15:46] that that christ dwelt in and being that
[15:49] then he was
[15:50] in the office of the prophet as we were
[15:53] talking about
[15:54] so he was called the son of man
[15:58] all right now brother branham is not
[16:00] we'll get to it in a minute he's not the
[16:01] son of man
[16:03] he is a son of man brother branham you
[16:06] know he couldn't be our lord and savior
[16:09] he couldn't be that one now you know a
[16:12] lot of people believe that that he was
[16:13] just that's fine i
[16:14] you know yourself and i i hope that
[16:17] there's nobody in the world
[16:18] would ever think that brother brother
[16:20] dale didn't give all the honor and glory
[16:22] to
[16:23] to the prophet of god that it was bring
[16:25] the message caught or read it to you
[16:27] from him i don't claim it to be i could
[16:29] just go through and just
[16:31] preach a sermon like a lot of people do
[16:33] and i'm not against that i'm just my
[16:35] ministry but
[16:36] you know a lot of people just preach a
[16:37] message across you don't know whether or
[16:39] not they're right or what's going on
[16:41] because you have no way of
[16:43] checking it other than trying to
[16:45] remember on your own
[16:47] whether that be that away or not but you
[16:50] know
[16:50] i i pray that you would just you know
[16:53] take it home and study it
[16:55] all right see we talked about the son of
[16:58] man
[17:00] then being the ministry of the lord
[17:02] jesus christ and that in that ministry
[17:05] that he had the voice of the
[17:07] resurrection
[17:09] the and he had the the sign of jonah
[17:13] you know and that's the voice of the
[17:14] resurrection not that's necessarily
[17:16] jesus would be there
[17:18] three days and three nights he was but
[17:20] not like we want to counter times
[17:22] and get all confused and and then we
[17:24] spend all our time staying on that
[17:26] subject and
[17:27] instead of seeing what the real truth of
[17:29] it was he had the resurrection sign
[17:32] he could heal the sick he could raise
[17:34] the dead like brother dick was talking
[17:35] about
[17:36] after service then the disciples even
[17:38] their ministry
[17:39] they could heal the sick and things but
[17:41] there was things they couldn't do
[17:44] because they did not have that ministry
[17:46] to do that they were not the son of man
[17:48] and you see in the last days that you
[17:50] and i us ministers we have our ministry
[17:53] and
[17:54] the things and the gifts of god but
[17:56] we're not responsible for what the
[17:58] prophet was
[17:59] to bring the message unto us you know
[18:02] the word
[18:03] see we have ours we have our gifts we
[18:05] have you know
[18:06] i believe in healing and signs and
[18:08] wonders and all of that i believe that's
[18:10] in the bride of christ around the world
[18:12] i believe in that but there's not one of
[18:15] us persons see they can stand up and do
[18:17] like brother branham did
[18:18] see i'll guarantee you healing for your
[18:20] 24 worst cases
[18:22] because we wouldn't have the backup
[18:24] authority
[18:25] from almighty god but i believe around
[18:27] the world
[18:29] in the bride of jesus christ that the
[18:31] ministry of jesus christ is here
[18:33] amen i believe the son of man ministry
[18:36] the resurrection ministry is here
[18:38] and that was what i was trying to bring
[18:40] out that the son of man being the voice
[18:44] then that raised lazarus and would be
[18:47] the voice that would raise the dead and
[18:48] then the end time then
[18:50] amen all right so what are we trying to
[18:52] do
[18:53] get the word here it was brought by the
[18:56] prophet
[18:57] all right but he was not the son of man
[19:00] but he's part of the son of man because
[19:02] the bride of jesus christ
[19:04] will be the fullness of the godhead
[19:06] bodily your prophet said
[19:08] and also it will be the son of man
[19:11] all right because that's where the
[19:13] resurrection's coming from
[19:15] and you say well why is the resurrection
[19:16] taking place because we're not in our
[19:18] right place
[19:19] that's right it's sensible right
[19:22] that's where we need to each one find
[19:24] our place right but we need to get into
[19:26] adoption and and try to find our place
[19:28] and not somebody else's place
[19:31] you know get to the position we're
[19:33] supposed to be in
[19:34] and then god can take care of it and
[19:36] then all the way around the world it's
[19:38] going to be a resurrection
[19:39] it's not just going to be in lulu
[19:41] georgia and everybody's got to come to
[19:42] lula
[19:43] you know we've never talked nothing like
[19:45] that it's going to be around the world
[19:47] in the bride of jesus christ and see
[19:50] that that voice will be
[19:51] in her because she will be the under her
[19:54] messenger
[19:54] she will be the final voice to the final
[19:56] age in other words the voice of the
[19:59] resurrection is going to come from the
[20:00] bride
[20:02] now it's not going to be that we're
[20:03] going to all get together and go out and
[20:04] holler
[20:05] dead come up no
[20:08] no it's just going to be when we become
[20:12] the word the dead will
[20:13] come among us because we will then have
[20:16] the voice of the resurrection
[20:18] calling her out of the grave all right
[20:21] now
[20:22] you say well why haven't we why well
[20:24] brother branham's in the grave
[20:27] we got to call him out whatever you
[20:30] believe will happen when he gets here
[20:32] whatever you believe you still got to go
[20:34] with one thing right
[20:36] he's waiting on us you say well no
[20:39] no he just waiting on time well time has
[20:42] to do with us
[20:43] just put it that way on it but see
[20:45] that's that's where we're at
[20:47] all right because that son of man
[20:51] is the voice of the resurrection
[20:55] he proved it by raising the dead to
[20:57] doing the things now all right
[20:59] now so let's move on into it see she
[21:02] must become
[21:04] the son of man which is the word made
[21:06] flesh
[21:07] in this day right all right now brother
[21:10] adam is part of that
[21:11] right right do we know the word was in
[21:13] him because he brought the word
[21:15] that's sensible you know he brought the
[21:17] word unto us
[21:18] all right he done his part now he's
[21:21] resting waiting on you and i
[21:23] to become the word that he brought right
[21:26] that's that's
[21:26] that's no problem all right we'll see
[21:30] brother brown then and we want to get on
[21:31] this just keep putting this message with
[21:33] the morning's message
[21:36] brother branham was not the son of man
[21:40] see because he wasn't the lord jesus
[21:42] christ we don't believe in that now
[21:45] but we believe that he was the prophet
[21:48] that god used to bring us the message
[21:51] right
[21:51] amen we believed that but let's just get
[21:54] into it and just read a little bit now
[21:56] as i said then just read one two three
[21:58] four five and then and if you'll just
[22:00] read them in order sometimes you'll
[22:02] you'll see that uh you know it's just
[22:04] following right through what the prophet
[22:05] had to say
[22:06] all right so on the message anointed
[22:09] once the end times 65
[22:11] 25 the morning service paragraph 258
[22:16] he says in the very day that the son of
[22:18] man is revealed revelations 10 1 through
[22:20] 7.
[22:20] let's see he puts it over to the earth
[22:24] we'll get over there one day and bring
[22:26] it out maybe on it but
[22:27] see read it when you get home the
[22:30] seventh angel's message
[22:32] that's it opening of the seals
[22:35] now what's the seventh angel's message
[22:37] opening of the seals
[22:39] it was not in the years of preparation
[22:41] and all that it was opening of the seals
[22:44] all right now watch what is it
[22:48] not the angel is the son of man
[22:52] but the messenger is revealing the son
[22:55] of man
[22:56] can you get it separated now he says
[23:00] that's where it seems to be so hard for
[23:02] you you see
[23:03] not the son of man himself
[23:06] but the seventh angel the seventh
[23:10] messenger
[23:11] is revealing to the public the son of
[23:13] man
[23:15] now watch because it's left to shuck
[23:20] now remember that in a minute because
[23:21] mary is the shook
[23:23] mary's pentecostal shuck
[23:27] that's not against her
[23:30] and we'll get to all of that in a minute
[23:32] because it's left to shuck
[23:34] he can't organize it
[23:37] it's the grain itself again right
[23:41] all right now and in the day that that
[23:44] day jackson james will
[23:46] withstand anointed ones make believers
[23:48] and unbelievers church former and the
[23:49] pentecostals
[23:50] stand up against the true grain but let
[23:52] them alone their folly be made manifest
[23:54] as theirs was
[23:56] you understand all right now what is it
[24:01] he's revealing the son of man
[24:05] he is not the son of man
[24:08] he's the seventh angel of course in the
[24:10] message now they got it all so
[24:12] revelated see the the son of the the
[24:15] seventh church age messenger was was
[24:17] back here and then
[24:19] he come on over here and he become god
[24:21] over here well that's like river jordan
[24:23] when they
[24:24] got jesus becoming god so that's all
[24:26] right that's their business all i'm
[24:28] doing is just trying to
[24:30] get what little group listening to me
[24:31] and get us prepared
[24:33] because i'm not preparing trying to
[24:34] prepare everybody around the world it's
[24:36] what's here
[24:37] all right now
[24:40] then look at the next one now
[24:43] let's get into this just a minute
[24:46] because he says there
[24:47] in the quote we just read
[24:50] he said it's the grain itself again
[24:54] all right now let's read that while
[24:56] we're right on that
[24:58] that's in uh john
[25:03] john 12.
[25:06] let's read what he's talking about the
[25:08] grain yeah
[25:12] huh
[25:14] verse 23 24
[25:18] and jesus answered them saying the hour
[25:20] is come
[25:21] that the son of man should be glorified
[25:23] now it goes on down through a whole lot
[25:25] over here
[25:26] but i'm just wanting to pick out the
[25:27] part we're talking about
[25:29] now watch jesus 21st 24th verse verily
[25:32] verily i say unto you
[25:34] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[25:37] ground
[25:37] and die it abideth alone
[25:40] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[25:43] fruit
[25:44] all right now that was the only way as i
[25:47] said this morning that you could
[25:49] get into the kingdom of god or the
[25:51] throne of god or the domain of god
[25:54] was what jesus christ would have to die
[25:59] to release the life all right then it
[26:01] would come back
[26:02] on the day of pentecost to begin the the
[26:06] bride of jesus christ which would be the
[26:08] the grain of
[26:09] wheat that would be
[26:13] coming forth all right but we also know
[26:16] that in that
[26:18] that it did not fulfill it completely
[26:21] because that grain of wheat would have
[26:23] to go into the ground
[26:25] so that's what you see you see about
[26:26] four church ages
[26:28] and the full word of god mature word was
[26:30] going into the ground
[26:32] there and as it did then
[26:35] you see luther coming out with the two
[26:38] little shoots the sprouts and then you
[26:39] see wesley coming on up for the shuck
[26:42] and then you i mean the uh the tonsils
[26:44] and then you see the pentecostals coming
[26:46] up to be the show
[26:48] now it's not that those are not worth
[26:50] anything
[26:52] because this the natural story would
[26:54] tell you that
[26:55] when you look out there and you see an
[26:58] ear of corn start growing
[27:00] you know just you just see it just a
[27:02] little bit growing
[27:03] okay i got corn now let's go ahead and
[27:06] cut it down
[27:10] well brother dale no you'd kill it
[27:13] but i've heard people kill the gospel by
[27:17] saying
[27:17] luther wesley them didn't have anything
[27:21] there's only alpha and only omega see
[27:25] brother brown said it's all that's in
[27:27] between
[27:29] but you don't hear that when you're just
[27:30] saying nothing in between
[27:32] there's a quote of that see but the
[27:34] quotes will kill you remember
[27:36] all right but see now you see what the
[27:38] corn of wheat
[27:39] the grain of wheat the not
[27:43] corn it's the corn of wheat see it's not
[27:45] talking about raising corn
[27:47] even though corn is used it's talking
[27:50] about the corn of wheat in other words
[27:52] the
[27:53] the wheat itself growing all right so
[27:54] let's watch it now
[27:57] okay let's read the next quote 269 the
[28:02] anointed ones the end times 65 7 25 in
[28:04] the morning
[28:05] now i want you to know this is true you
[28:08] that listen to this tape you might have
[28:10] thought today
[28:11] that i was trying to say that about
[28:14] myself
[28:16] now he he's getting it playing then
[28:20] being that i was packing the message
[28:23] watching i have no more to do with it
[28:27] than nothing no more than just a voice
[28:30] in my voice even against my better
[28:32] judgment i wanted to be a trapper
[28:36] but it's the will of my father that i
[28:38] declare to do
[28:40] and determined to do i wasn't the one
[28:44] that appeared on the river jordan i was
[28:46] only standing there when he appeared
[28:49] i'm not the one that performed these
[28:51] things and foretells these things that
[28:53] happens as perfect as they are
[28:55] i'm only one that's near when he does it
[28:59] i was only a voice that he used to say
[29:01] it
[29:02] it wasn't what i knew it's what i just
[29:05] surrendered myself to
[29:07] myself to that he spoke through
[29:10] it isn't me it wasn't the seventh
[29:13] angel oh no it was a manifestation of
[29:17] the son of man
[29:19] it wasn't the angel his message it was
[29:22] the mystery that god unfolded
[29:25] it's not a man it's god the angel was
[29:29] not the son of man
[29:30] he was a messenger from the son of man
[29:33] the son of man is christ
[29:35] he's the one that you're feeding on
[29:36] you're not feeding on a man
[29:39] a man his words will fail but you're
[29:41] feeding on the unfailing body word
[29:44] of the son of man all right that should
[29:46] be enough to make everybody understand
[29:49] what we're talking about and put brother
[29:51] around him into his position
[29:53] and everything and to see that he's not
[29:57] the son of man but somebody's got to be
[29:59] the son of man in the end time
[30:01] well you're making yourself greater and
[30:03] brother branham no
[30:04] i'm just trying to come to the place to
[30:06] be what he just said
[30:08] he said i determined to do it because
[30:10] god wanted me to do it
[30:12] i'm kind of like gersom solomon i
[30:14] believe a rabbi richmond said one time i
[30:16] remember
[30:17] he said i can't have it god chose us
[30:29] but i didn't have anything to be chosen
[30:31] to come in this message but i'm glad he
[30:32] did
[30:34] you know i'm tickled to death about that
[30:36] part
[30:37] all right now he calls the son of man
[30:40] christ
[30:41] all right the one that you're feeding on
[30:43] which would be the work the reveal
[30:45] what is christ christ is just called the
[30:49] anointing
[30:50] by most people but christ to mean to me
[30:54] means the word and spirit together is
[30:55] one
[30:57] see the anointed word
[31:01] which is the revealed word the alive
[31:03] word
[31:04] all right now that's what i mean when
[31:05] i'm saying to christ
[31:07] you know coming all the way down not
[31:09] just to stop on anointed ones
[31:11] so look what he says on number two if
[31:13] you know it's page 15 it's right in the
[31:14] sun
[31:15] 65 418 the morning service now who is
[31:18] this son of man
[31:22] who is this son of man in the beginning
[31:24] was a word
[31:25] and the word was with god and the word
[31:27] was god and the word was made flesh and
[31:29] dwelt among us
[31:33] that's fine man can that be enough to
[31:36] know who the son of man is
[31:38] the word make flesh all right it goes
[31:40] down to the last parts of the different
[31:42] scriptures that are acquainted
[31:43] luke 17 30 malachi 4 that the word again
[31:47] is waved over the people
[31:48] that the dead traditions of man is dead
[31:51] and the son of god is alive again with
[31:53] the baptism of the holy spirit right
[31:54] among us
[31:55] and has given us life the son of god the
[31:58] baptism of the holy ghost is alive among
[32:00] us now let's just get the word
[32:05] and let it become disarmed simple
[32:07] language isn't it
[32:09] okay so what are we following
[32:18] look what he said on number three of
[32:19] your notes on the rapture
[32:22] 1965-1204 here at 117.
[32:26] that's all to be manifested in the grain
[32:28] of wheat at the end
[32:31] all right another come back
[32:34] if you take luke the 17th chapter and
[32:38] the 30th verse he said
[32:39] as it was in the days of sodom so shall
[32:42] it be in the coming son of man
[32:44] when the son of man begins to reveal
[32:46] himself what is reveal
[32:47] and this is what he said what is
[32:48] revealed make his revelation
[32:51] of what he is in this day
[32:57] make his revelation of what he is in
[33:00] this day
[33:01] revealed out to the people
[33:05] now this is not the days of luther this
[33:06] is not the days of western it's not the
[33:08] days of pentecost
[33:12] this is a very special day but makes his
[33:16] revelation make his revelation of what
[33:18] he is
[33:19] in this day revealed to the people
[33:22] the word that's made known for the day
[33:25] revealed to the people by the
[33:28] manifestation of the holy spirit
[33:30] making that jesus live among us
[33:34] all right making it live among us
[33:38] now watch the verb this point very
[33:40] carefully
[33:42] and you'll understand what i was talking
[33:45] about
[33:46] now watch the point we're going to get
[33:47] to and you'll understand
[33:49] what i was talking about how the bride
[33:52] must be
[33:52] the son of man now watch the
[33:55] illustration
[33:56] because that's what we're going to do
[33:59] we're going to follow the prophet
[34:01] through the message
[34:02] to see and we'll see that we are what
[34:07] the son of man what the grain of wheat
[34:12] that is promised to come for
[34:15] forth is the son of man the word
[34:21] there's john 12 23-24
[34:25] because that was said it was fine to
[34:28] cover that
[34:29] as being the new birth coming through
[34:31] the ages
[34:34] but there's got to be a full grain of
[34:37] wheat
[34:39] come forth a mature grain you don't
[34:42] gather
[34:42] wheat or things as it's green or or
[34:45] whatever it is
[34:46] or corn or whatever you've got to let it
[34:49] go through the stages
[34:50] that it goes through and then it will be
[34:53] back to original grain
[34:56] see once that era corn or once that
[34:58] grain
[34:59] is formed and it's dried
[35:03] then it's capable of reproducing itself
[35:07] so you have you put one grain in the
[35:09] ground that comes up with a stalk
[35:11] you know and then the chutes and then
[35:13] the the the shucks
[35:15] and things and then you know the hush
[35:17] the shucks and all the come forth
[35:19] the husk on it and what it do then it
[35:21] walks out and then
[35:23] it's a grain of corn back again but you
[35:26] know what that grain corn has the
[35:27] ability to do
[35:29] reproduce itself to bring forth a head
[35:33] of wheat
[35:34] you know many many grains of wheat are a
[35:37] corn
[35:38] thing when they are corn and you look on
[35:41] there and each one of those kernels let
[35:42] it dry
[35:43] take each one of those kernels put it in
[35:44] the ground each one of those kernels
[35:46] will reproduce you don't
[35:47] just go out there and say well i'm going
[35:48] to plant me a garden in spring
[35:50] and you go out there and you plant one
[35:52] grain of corn here one here and one here
[35:53] and one here in the union
[35:55] and you know it comes up is one grain of
[35:56] corn comes up that wouldn't be
[35:58] too productive you know you'd be wasting
[36:02] time
[36:04] but see when it comes forth in a
[36:05] multiplied form
[36:07] is what you want all right so now what
[36:10] is it
[36:11] so the grain of wheat that is promised
[36:13] to come forth in the last days
[36:15] is the son of man
[36:18] and the grain of wheat is going to come
[36:20] forth end of bride
[36:24] that's why brother branham was not that
[36:25] grain of wheat by himself
[36:28] no more than john as we were covering
[36:30] this morning
[36:31] john could only type the rapture
[36:38] he was not the rapture and the only one
[36:40] going right
[36:41] he would only type in the ones that
[36:45] would go
[36:45] all right now he's got to come back to
[36:49] the same grain of wheat
[36:51] all right so let's look at number four
[36:55] anointing one's at the end time
[36:57] paragraph 165
[36:59] just look you read all of it uh well
[37:01] let's go why does it
[37:03] why haven't there been an organization
[37:04] start up in these last 20 years
[37:07] of this great revival it's anointed
[37:10] prophets anointed teachers so forth
[37:12] but by but why ain't there
[37:16] there's nothing beyond the grain see
[37:18] it's back without an organization
[37:21] oh my a blind man could see that it
[37:23] can't cannot organize
[37:25] it's so firmly against us it's a grain
[37:27] of wheat itself
[37:29] the son of man will be made manifest the
[37:31] grain of wheat will come back to itself
[37:34] again the son of man in the last days
[37:37] well that's brother branham then that
[37:38] brother amen come on
[37:42] but he wasn't the son of man
[37:46] it's going to take the bride because
[37:48] it's not just one grain of wheat that
[37:49] jesus went into the ground and one grain
[37:51] of wheat's coming out in the end time
[37:54] he's got to come forth in a bride form
[37:57] all right the grain of wheat see
[38:00] all right now let me say something to
[38:03] you that you may not
[38:04] have considered
[38:08] so you cannot now quoting rhetoric
[38:12] you cannot denominate this message
[38:18] all right now you can organize it right
[38:22] now he said you could organize it into
[38:23] legacy
[38:26] in other words you can be just like the
[38:27] organizations
[38:29] all right but you can't denominate it
[38:31] now show me the denomination's been
[38:33] formed
[38:34] now i ain't saying the organization i
[38:36] ain't saying the clicks the
[38:38] the flings off the doctrinal ideas of
[38:41] the two soul the seven thunder virtues
[38:43] of
[38:43] perusias the river a doctrine i'm not
[38:46] saying that
[38:48] not talking about none whatsoever of
[38:50] that form
[38:51] i'm talking about the little bride
[38:54] around the world
[38:56] that is becoming the word of god as they
[38:58] hear the word
[39:01] all right now show me a show me a
[39:03] denomination that's formed out of it
[39:07] he brought around said 20 years there
[39:08] that was that was in his life
[39:11] see a minister always likes it about
[39:13] three years and then just in a few years
[39:15] and organized it and denominated
[39:17] now i agree that they're organizational
[39:19] what is an organization
[39:21] and i'm not against printing the books
[39:23] or anything like that thank god for all
[39:25] to do it
[39:26] but what is it doing let's get the the
[39:28] organization spirit said
[39:30] let's get together what luther had and
[39:32] we'll put it in books and then we can
[39:33] just
[39:34] we can have exactly what luther said
[39:36] well there's a lot of churches around
[39:37] the land today that are sitting there in
[39:39] the churches
[39:40] saying we don't want to listen to no
[39:41] preacher we want to get it straight from
[39:44] the prophet
[39:45] all right besides all the doctrines and
[39:47] things like that but that's none of my
[39:49] business
[39:49] that's nothing to me that's just saying
[39:51] it to show you that it's taking place
[39:54] to explain one thing what that
[39:57] the bride of jesus christ is having a
[40:00] revival
[40:01] because brother ryan said in this
[40:03] revival
[40:05] now he said the revival's over didn't he
[40:09] about 56 all right but here he says
[40:12] revival
[40:16] he said 20 years in this revival
[40:20] see the bride is having a revival
[40:25] ever since i come in this message i've
[40:26] been having a revival you know what a
[40:28] revival is
[40:29] that's not sinners getting saved a
[40:31] revival is to revive what's already
[40:33] saved
[40:37] we say we get a revival we get a bunch
[40:39] of lost people and all that
[40:40] you get a revival to get the the people
[40:42] in the church
[40:43] together and then sinners are going to
[40:45] hear about it they're going to come to
[40:46] see the fire
[40:49] see this message has been going quite a
[40:51] while 40 something years that i've been
[40:53] in it and i've been having a revival
[40:55] ever since
[40:58] brother dale i see you sometimes you're
[41:00] all right that ain't got nothing to do
[41:01] with it
[41:03] you've seen brother branham coming down
[41:05] through there but you know what he's
[41:06] having a revival
[41:09] but he said the revival to the world is
[41:11] over
[41:12] i ain't talking about a revival to the
[41:14] world i'm talking about a bride
[41:17] the bride's revival is what i talk about
[41:19] not the world
[41:20] no we're through with all of that see
[41:24] all right let's see what you're talking
[41:25] about
[41:32] all right now it will come back to
[41:34] itself again
[41:38] in other words this thing is going to
[41:39] have to come back
[41:41] until that little bride that will be
[41:43] taken up
[41:46] you know i use that now the little bride
[41:48] around the world i say it's a small
[41:49] group yes
[41:52] i'm talking about the bride now ain't
[41:53] talking about how he's following this
[41:54] message nothing like that i ain't cure
[41:56] ain't none what i'm talking about
[41:57] talking about the bribe bride's only the
[41:59] born again believers
[42:01] the rapture is only for the bride the
[42:04] royal seat of abraham i'm talking about
[42:06] that not everybody in the message that
[42:07] claims the message
[42:08] because that ain't none of my business
[42:10] now none of your business or none of us
[42:12] business who claims what
[42:15] probably said he didn't want me to be
[42:16] saved in the last moment to rapture the
[42:18] church so
[42:19] we're still believing in salvation and
[42:21] still believing in god working
[42:23] all right but in doing that now
[42:29] it's got to come back to the grain
[42:35] that went into the ground which was the
[42:38] lord jesus christ
[42:40] now get the point i know
[42:45] see the faith of the fathers was what
[42:46] was planted on the day of pentecost
[42:49] amen the faith of the founders is what
[42:52] was planted on the death pentecost
[42:55] not the full grain of the son of man
[42:59] because they didn't know what the seals
[43:00] were and things like that right
[43:02] that wasn't put into the ground it was
[43:04] put into the ground of the lord jesus
[43:06] yes for what he could bring forth but he
[43:09] only
[43:09] only could bring forth on the day of
[43:11] pentecost the faith of the fathers
[43:13] that's right all right now so in doing
[43:16] that
[43:17] see that is what's got to come forth
[43:20] first
[43:21] before you can talk about a grain
[43:24] of wheat you've got to be able to get
[43:27] back to what
[43:28] the pentecostals i'm talking about in
[43:31] the bible
[43:33] not a sister street right back to the
[43:36] book of acts
[43:38] and i contend for that i always get in
[43:41] trouble because i express it because i
[43:43] don't want to leave you dangling
[43:45] you bring them that was back there on
[43:47] the deaf pentecost up here today
[43:49] and they would probably tell you hey
[43:51] folks leave us alone and let us go back
[43:54] where we came from
[43:55] because we ain't never faced such a
[43:57] garbage can as this
[43:58] we only had two denominations pharisees
[44:01] and sadducees and
[44:02] herodians or whatever you want to call
[44:03] them i said my lord everything where we
[44:06] turn around there's one
[44:08] right i don't say that to try to prop
[44:11] up nothing i say it cause it's the truth
[44:15] you say i'm just doing that because make
[44:17] a justification well
[44:18] where are you at that's right that's the
[44:21] best way to say it and forgive me
[44:24] where are you at and where have you been
[44:28] you've been here with us all of this
[44:29] time
[44:31] and you know this church knows and those
[44:33] listening know that there's one thing
[44:35] brother dale's always done he's never
[44:36] been down and out about the word
[44:38] i've always been on fire about the word
[44:40] being revealed
[44:42] because that's my revival because i'm
[44:45] not looking for a revival to save the
[44:47] world
[44:48] that's right i'm looking to be revived
[44:50] myself
[44:52] to walk on the end of the word so i then
[44:54] you see what i'm talking about
[44:55] the faith of the fathers was that corn
[44:58] of wheat that went into the ground yes
[45:00] but when it comes back in the end time
[45:03] when that is standing here
[45:05] on the earth everybody in the world can
[45:06] have the faith of the fathers
[45:08] that's right and that still wouldn't be
[45:12] the corner wheat that fell in the ground
[45:15] because that would not be the full
[45:16] ministry of the lord jesus christ
[45:18] do you understand yes all right see it
[45:22] wouldn't be complete
[45:23] why because that wasn't him
[45:27] he then he's got to come forth
[45:30] the original grain of the lord jesus
[45:32] christ that went into the ground has got
[45:34] to come back
[45:36] these are a man has got to come back
[45:38] upon the earth again
[45:39] in that grain form all right i wrote it
[45:42] like this
[45:43] who was the original grain the lord
[45:46] jesus christ
[45:49] he was the original grain of wheat
[45:51] because he was the original word
[45:54] which was what the son of man
[45:59] the word might flesh all right look at
[46:01] number five
[46:03] you see how i get on this and i can stop
[46:05] and preach forever on just one thing
[46:08] brother i i remember when was in the
[46:10] baptists and things i know you're gonna
[46:13] thank dawn brother dale you never would
[46:14] that way but we used to we had sunday
[46:17] school class we'll
[46:18] see we would always uh take up the
[46:20] offering and
[46:21] he hauled around to try to kill a little
[46:23] time because we had an hour that we had
[46:24] to say something in
[46:27] how many of you ever come through there
[46:28] come on and so we'd goof off a little
[46:31] bit to kind of take up some time
[46:33] and then we finally get around to taking
[46:35] up the offer and we wanted the guy to be
[46:37] real slow taking up the offering because
[46:39] we you know we didn't have nothing to
[46:40] say
[46:41] yeah brother around come along he said i
[46:44] just don't have enough time to preach
[46:47] he said i could take any of these topics
[46:49] and preach for years
[46:51] on this one i'd hear him say that i said
[46:55] my
[46:56] lord i can probably take 30 minutes now
[47:00] to
[47:01] give out of what i've got you know but
[47:03] you know now
[47:04] i found out i can't give out i give out
[47:07] it just opens up the more
[47:09] keeps going but come on and watch what
[47:11] he says
[47:15] because i believe the bride of jesus
[47:16] christ now whether you believe it or
[47:18] anybody else here and believes that
[47:19] whatever i believe the bride of jesus
[47:21] christ will be the son of man
[47:25] the grain of wheat that went into the
[47:27] ground i believed it in 1969 when i
[47:29] preached it
[47:30] in about 7 69 74
[47:34] a big brother came out started preaching
[47:36] about son of man and everybody went
[47:37] hallelujah
[47:38] well i did too because i was glad they
[47:40] finally caught on
[47:41] i don't claim seniority i just tell it
[47:43] like it is
[47:46] because that's where i started that
[47:47] because i believed it then how much more
[47:49] do you think i believe it now
[47:54] spiritual food and deer season 1965 7 18
[47:57] in the evening paragraph 162.
[48:03] and he comes down to mystery of this
[48:04] those seals each one of those churches
[48:06] made an
[48:06] organization and and got into it
[48:10] and that's one of the secret things
[48:11] that's been wrong before god
[48:14] you see it dr lee see look it is
[48:18] that's the thing right there that's one
[48:20] of the secrets
[48:22] they organized in sea and was completely
[48:24] out of the will of god
[48:27] and that will be exposed in the last
[48:29] days
[48:31] and lead to people now be exposed that
[48:35] that's
[48:35] wrong and lead the people not to a creed
[48:39] or a denomination but back to the true
[48:42] word
[48:42] the true word will come to a certain
[48:45] group of people
[48:47] the son of man will reveal himself in
[48:49] the midst of them
[48:51] the same yesterday today and forever
[48:53] that's right
[48:54] now you say well that's just brother
[48:55] branham
[48:57] that wasn't what he said going down
[49:00] christ
[49:00] revealed his own word 65 8 22 the
[49:02] morning service
[49:04] then he was made actually human flesh
[49:06] and dwelt among us in the person of
[49:08] jesus christ himself
[49:09] born of the virgin mary he come in that
[49:11] form so he could die
[49:12] and went back into heaven now in this
[49:15] last days he has promised to manifest
[49:17] himself
[49:18] in the fullness again of his flesh in
[49:21] spirit
[49:22] and that's a good way of saying it but
[49:24] don't sound right does it
[49:26] again in his flesh in spirit see for
[49:29] it was in the days of sodom so
[49:32] for as it was in the days of sodom so
[49:34] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[49:35] man
[49:36] now look at sodom how it's said and
[49:38] taken place jesus christ being
[49:40] manifested in bodily form
[49:42] of his church today
[49:46] okay see doing the same thing
[49:49] same work same things that he did all
[49:51] the time
[49:52] never changes the eternal one seen
[49:54] there's where that old thing comes in
[49:56] there
[49:56] i don't see nothing going on
[49:59] well get out of your backyard and look
[50:01] around the world
[50:05] just because it's not in your yard
[50:12] like i said we don't think about a
[50:14] trailer coming off of a trailer hitch
[50:16] and just hung on the chains and dragging
[50:17] it down the road and running off
[50:19] we don't think that's very much
[50:24] but you let it happen to you sometimes
[50:25] you'll change your mind
[50:30] maybe god needs to let some of those
[50:32] things happen to us where it'll change
[50:33] our minds
[50:36] what he has manifested himself in the
[50:38] human bodies
[50:41] our human bodies that he has called and
[50:43] done exactly the same thing he done in
[50:45] sundry time
[50:46] and in the times of his flesh upon the
[50:48] earth now let me stop right there
[50:51] brother branham had the sign of the son
[50:52] of man nobody else didn't have it
[50:55] but what did the rest of the people have
[50:56] just like their disciples had they had
[50:58] healings and signs and wonders
[51:01] now he wasn't it by himself was he
[51:05] the room never claimed to be the only
[51:07] guy on the pebble on the beach
[51:10] he said god is among us doing
[51:14] like he done in the book of acts
[51:17] and well yeah we see that brother
[51:19] branham now we you know
[51:20] that's we see that brother branham look
[51:23] what he goes on down to the next one
[51:25] mighty god unveiled 1964
[51:27] uh 629 prior to page 21.
[51:31] he's talking about jesus as it was in
[51:34] the days of sodom so shall it be at the
[51:35] coming of the son of man
[51:37] deity veiled again in human flesh
[51:41] oh yeah i can see it right around i see
[51:43] it brother adam
[51:44] i don't see it nobody else well what are
[51:47] you supposed to be
[51:49] you got the baptism of the holy ghost do
[51:51] you have the new birth
[51:52] hello i'm talking to the people that's
[51:55] got that idea
[51:56] you have the new birth come on
[51:59] within that new birth is deity amen
[52:02] it's what i told a man standing up at
[52:04] the tabernacle i mean i was at the
[52:06] schoolhouse where they were having a
[52:07] meeting there
[52:08] jeffersonville and he was talking about
[52:10] something and i said listen brother
[52:11] if you'll believe because i knew what he
[52:14] believed i said but if you believe i
[52:15] pointed over this brother
[52:16] i said if you'll believe that that
[52:18] brother right there with the new birth
[52:20] in his soul that that is deity speaking
[52:24] when he speaks then without the gifts
[52:26] and the signs and the wonders that went
[52:28] with the prophet now
[52:29] just that individual person being there
[52:32] i'll go with you on deity
[52:34] he said oh no brother
[52:39] i knew who his deity was and who his god
[52:41] was
[52:42] all right i didn't care to discuss
[52:44] anything else with it
[52:48] all right deity
[52:52] now remember didn't jesus say when the
[52:54] son of god is being revealed
[52:56] listen in luke the 17th and i believe in
[52:59] the 20th 21st or
[53:01] somewhere along there he said when the
[53:02] son of man is being revealed
[53:04] the son of man back in in the church
[53:07] again
[53:08] revealed in human beings
[53:12] amen human beings
[53:16] not son of god but the son of man again
[53:18] back in the church again
[53:20] in the last days we find that he
[53:22] promised that and got
[53:24] there in god's promises
[53:31] yeah we're back with a quote we was
[53:33] given this morning kind of on and
[53:35] talking on it
[53:36] what was it unveiling of god 1964 614
[53:39] the morning service
[53:40] paragraph 68 and then after the holy
[53:44] spirit
[53:45] and he came versus the prophet and they
[53:47] crucified him his own crucified him he
[53:48] came as the son of man
[53:51] then after the holy spirit came he was
[53:53] then in the son of god
[53:55] not as a spirit he was the holy spirit
[53:57] son of god he lived through the church
[53:59] ages as son of god
[54:01] now in the millennium he'll be son of
[54:03] david sitting upon the throne of his
[54:04] father david he is the son of david now
[54:08] he's already to son of david there's
[54:10] nobody that knows it that's right
[54:12] you don't gain no attributes he's
[54:14] already got him
[54:16] he's waiting on somebody to display it
[54:17] right and remember
[54:19] between the son of god
[54:23] now he's explaining what i did this
[54:25] morning that it goes son of man
[54:27] son of god son of man son of david
[54:31] that's why he's got to return in the end
[54:32] time is that and now between the son of
[54:35] god in the lady of sin church age they
[54:37] put him out
[54:38] and in luke he said that he would be
[54:40] revealed against son of man the prophet
[54:42] fulfilling the rest of it and the
[54:44] scriptures tie perfectly together son of
[54:46] man
[54:47] son of god son of david what was it it's
[54:49] the same god all the time just changing
[54:51] his form
[54:52] in morphe he just changed it it's a
[54:54] great drama to him
[54:56] he's acting it out
[55:02] he's acting it out in other words coming
[55:04] back to be in what
[55:06] the original grain that went into the
[55:10] ground
[55:14] the original word that went into the
[55:17] ground
[55:18] all right so now watch what it comes to
[55:23] number nine and you know see not out
[55:24] with a shock 65 to
[55:26] 18 paragraph 97
[55:32] he talked about one's a bride the other
[55:34] one's a church he said there's no
[55:35] comparison at all
[55:37] i like that from one woman and free
[55:39] woman is what he's explaining
[55:40] he's explaining the denominations
[55:42] persecute the genuine grain
[55:45] all right coming down to it but still
[55:48] they are not the seed that's promised to
[55:50] come
[55:52] listen neither was sarah
[55:56] neither was hagar
[55:59] neither sarah or or neither mary was
[56:02] deceived
[56:07] what's in there mary was not deceived
[56:10] can you quote that and people take that
[56:11] quote and they said see that marry mary
[56:13] wouldn't deceive
[56:14] she represents seducing street pentecost
[56:16] and so that means they have nothing
[56:18] my brother didn't say that
[56:21] right azusa street pentecost was the
[56:24] word
[56:26] the seed but not the seed back like it
[56:28] was supposed to be
[56:30] not the grain of wheat like it was
[56:31] supposed to be write that down
[56:34] listen mary was not the seed she was the
[56:37] carrier of the seed
[56:38] the city's talking about the grain of
[56:40] wheat right right
[56:42] but she had nurtured look what she done
[56:45] brought forth out of her wound
[56:48] just like the shuck brought forth from
[56:50] its wound to real seed
[56:52] but the shuck is not the seed now back
[56:54] in sarah what was it to be
[56:56] uh abraham and sarah which would be the
[56:58] the child coming from there would be the
[57:00] great one
[57:04] all right you followed me but the shuck
[57:07] is not the seed
[57:08] this looks like the shuck brought forth
[57:10] its wound from this wound the real seed
[57:13] see it brought forth there zeus street
[57:14] pentecost brought the birth of the word
[57:20] but that wasn't the final seed
[57:24] read masterpiece when you get a change
[57:26] or just listen to it
[57:29] and notice the times brought around what
[57:30] he's talking about that mary
[57:32] is not the seed and look what he's
[57:35] talking about
[57:36] she's not the original grain mary gave
[57:39] birth
[57:40] to a baby that was the original brain
[57:44] right but we're not to give birth to a
[57:47] baby
[57:49] we're to give birth to a full grown word
[57:52] right all right so follow it
[57:55] but the shuck is not the seed it's only
[57:59] it's closer to the seed it hugged up
[58:02] around the sea
[58:02] thank god for that shot to take care of
[58:06] us
[58:09] i can always say you know it's natural
[58:11] well thank god for the national rifle
[58:13] association
[58:14] i don't even belong to it but thank god
[58:16] for them because they trying to keep our
[58:17] freedom for a while
[58:19] right that's just in a natural
[58:23] i mean i don't belong to it they kept on
[58:25] sending me guns and i didn't know them
[58:27] and i told them i said i'm paid up for a
[58:31] long time and you're sending me done
[58:32] here to get me to pay you
[58:34] your records show that i'm paid up take
[58:36] my name off
[58:38] that was the reason way back up in the
[58:41] stalk
[58:43] the life is scattered all through the
[58:45] stalk
[58:47] now you with me the life is scattered
[58:50] when the two little shoots comes up
[58:51] that's green that's life
[58:53] when the stalk comes up that's green
[58:55] that's life when the tassel comes on the
[58:57] corn
[58:57] and when you've got all of the things
[58:59] the shuck and all it's green
[59:02] it's got life in it
[59:05] don't cut it down because you can't do
[59:07] it but after a while
[59:09] inside of that shuck the problem you
[59:11] heard him looking there with a
[59:12] microscope and you see a little bitty
[59:14] bud
[59:15] he said there's original seed
[59:20] because that's what you're annoying to
[59:21] be life is scattered all through the
[59:23] shook
[59:24] stalks and when it comes to the pollen
[59:27] it's gathered down closer
[59:28] and when it comes to the shuck it's
[59:30] right down there like the seed and forms
[59:32] it almost like the seed
[59:34] jesus told us what would be in the last
[59:36] days be so close we would see the very
[59:38] elective possible
[59:39] but when the seed comes forth from there
[59:42] and the shook
[59:43] the life leaves the shook and the shuck
[59:45] is a carrier
[59:46] and that's exactly what our denomination
[59:48] has been a carrier
[59:50] luther wesley pentecost and now it's
[59:52] time for the seed to come forth
[59:57] now it's time see he's not out with a
[59:59] shuck that was 97 this is
[1:00:02] uh paragraph 143. pentecost was as merry
[1:00:06] pentecostal feast look what mary did
[1:00:09] what did mary do wrong
[1:00:11] at a pentecostal feast one time she was
[1:00:14] faced with a bunch of dignities
[1:00:16] dignitaries excuse me priest when her
[1:00:20] son
[1:00:21] she couldn't find him anywhere and she
[1:00:22] went back three days journey she left
[1:00:24] him
[1:00:24] like a modern church today about three
[1:00:27] times five or
[1:00:28] 25 has a church left about 50 years ago
[1:00:31] we're 75
[1:00:33] left him at the pentecostal feast ain't
[1:00:36] that pentecosting that to people with
[1:00:38] this message
[1:00:38] we've got the word we've got the word
[1:00:40] we've got the word
[1:00:44] we are the seed and then living like the
[1:00:46] devil
[1:00:47] well that don't match up
[1:00:52] if i don't live what i preach would you
[1:00:53] please come and tell me
[1:00:58] you said well brother let's see that
[1:01:00] that's human now let's don't get onto
[1:01:02] this those parts because you got them
[1:01:04] let's talk about where that i'm out
[1:01:05] drinking gambling i'm doing
[1:01:07] all kind of things garbage cans i mean
[1:01:11] let's don't just get on a little pity
[1:01:12] patty thing or we can pity pat ourselves
[1:01:14] to death
[1:01:16] well you look at me and say well i've
[1:01:17] seen you do this and look basically i've
[1:01:19] seen you do that what good is that
[1:01:24] but we don't get out in the world of sin
[1:01:27] but look what happened left him at the
[1:01:29] pentecostal feast murray went back
[1:01:31] up with joseph three days looking for it
[1:01:35] she's been looking for him could she'd
[1:01:37] been looking for him couldn't find it
[1:01:39] she found him what did she find she
[1:01:42] found him in the temple discussing the
[1:01:43] word of god to the priest
[1:01:45] and right in the front of those priests
[1:01:46] those dignified
[1:01:49] mary let the curtain drop she did every
[1:01:53] exactly the things she should not have
[1:01:55] done
[1:01:57] call her god the mother of god
[1:02:00] you know who that's how many a mother or
[1:02:02] have more wisdom than her son
[1:02:05] and she said your father and i have
[1:02:07] sought you with tears for days and
[1:02:08] nights
[1:02:09] your father and i claiming that the
[1:02:11] birth wasn't supernatural
[1:02:13] that joseph was the father of jesus she
[1:02:15] denied the supernatural birth
[1:02:17] pentecost took speaking in tongues they
[1:02:19] denied the birth of the word
[1:02:20] that's exactly what it did they'll take
[1:02:23] so much of it
[1:02:24] but they won't take the rest of it it
[1:02:25] died the birth of the word just like
[1:02:27] mary
[1:02:29] so that's why he's saying that mary is
[1:02:31] not the same
[1:02:32] she gave birth but jesus was the seed
[1:02:36] what mary gave birth to an azusa street
[1:02:40] gave birth to
[1:02:43] the end time message of the baptism of
[1:02:45] the holy ghost
[1:02:47] and brother branham says that's when the
[1:02:49] prophet came
[1:02:52] oh no no no i didn't come to well you
[1:02:55] don't know your message go to 464 the
[1:02:57] seal book
[1:03:00] i'm pretty sure that's right there's no
[1:03:03] messenger to the age because the holy
[1:03:04] ghost came himself
[1:03:07] in the fullness then after them the
[1:03:10] prophet comes
[1:03:12] and the holy ghost had to come onto zeus
[1:03:14] street to make ready for brother brandon
[1:03:15] to come
[1:03:17] all right
[1:03:20] but now watch just keep on going where
[1:03:23] are we down to
[1:03:26] 11. all right see not out with a shuck
[1:03:29] 65
[1:03:29] 429 b the paragraph 77 now mary was not
[1:03:33] the seed she was only to shut through
[1:03:34] the seed
[1:03:35] the two others was carriers of life only
[1:03:38] the natural seed mary was not deceit
[1:03:40] herself but
[1:03:40] like faith in god's word brought a more
[1:03:44] real image of the word because he was
[1:03:46] the word
[1:03:48] but like the shock of a wheat the corn
[1:03:50] of wheat the shuck holds
[1:03:52] the wheat inside of it and protects it
[1:03:54] until it's able to
[1:03:56] able or mature to go on on its own
[1:03:59] see then it was the seed itself that
[1:04:02] left her
[1:04:03] just like the seed was in her womb she
[1:04:05] wasn't the seed
[1:04:06] she didn't produce the seed god is the
[1:04:10] seed
[1:04:12] now you see what she's saying that's not
[1:04:13] saying a zeus street was false
[1:04:17] they gave birth to the word easy age
[1:04:20] gave birth to the word martin luther
[1:04:22] gave birth to the word
[1:04:26] let's see that's where people won't
[1:04:27] follow it all the way through right they
[1:04:29] cut the
[1:04:29] scorn down if you looked in wesley it
[1:04:33] wasn't worth anything cut it down
[1:04:35] oh but you can't do that brother dale
[1:04:37] well i'm glad you thought of that
[1:04:40] if you thought of that a long time ago
[1:04:41] you wouldn't have the doctrines you've
[1:04:42] got
[1:04:45] right you don't understand brother you
[1:04:47] don't understand brother dale why i say
[1:04:48] a lot of those things maybe it's
[1:04:49] somebody out there because see a long
[1:04:51] time ago these doctrines would float in
[1:04:53] the land that's a doctrine it was back
[1:04:55] in 1968
[1:05:00] and great people of great men in this
[1:05:02] message says that
[1:05:03] azusa street was false and lutheran
[1:05:05] western then was false
[1:05:08] i wish to demand to his face it didn't
[1:05:10] do any good he come right here to this
[1:05:11] church that night and said the same
[1:05:12] thing again
[1:05:15] didn't change him one whatsoever you
[1:05:17] know why because he couldn't be
[1:05:18] corrected
[1:05:19] that's why it didn't change him but
[1:05:22] listen
[1:05:25] look at the unveiling of god 64 614
[1:05:27] paragraph 318
[1:05:29] now to the perfect after the shuck has
[1:05:31] been formed
[1:05:32] after the tassels been formed after the
[1:05:35] grain has come
[1:05:36] unto the cob then it has to come to
[1:05:39] perfection
[1:05:40] back to a regular grain again and
[1:05:43] remember the grain must be germatized
[1:05:45] see
[1:05:46] if it don't it won't live see
[1:05:49] none of that was outside of them
[1:05:51] messages will ever come to life
[1:05:54] it has to be germanized too remember the
[1:05:56] same life that was in the stalk is in
[1:05:58] the grain
[1:05:59] see it's just maturing itself back see
[1:06:02] he revealed himself what
[1:06:04] son of man the grain that went into the
[1:06:06] ground
[1:06:07] get the message the greek said to him we
[1:06:10] would see jesus
[1:06:11] he said except the corner wheat falls
[1:06:13] into the ground
[1:06:16] he turned him right to his death burial
[1:06:18] and resurrection was the only way they'd
[1:06:20] ever be ever seen
[1:06:24] harvest time 64 12 12 paragraph 353
[1:06:29] now doesn't malachi 4 teach us that
[1:06:31] before the great and terrible day of the
[1:06:32] lord shall come that this will take
[1:06:34] place
[1:06:35] how many knows that and he will restore
[1:06:37] the heart of the children to the fathers
[1:06:38] is that right the faith of the original
[1:06:40] pentecostal fathers
[1:06:42] and in that day luke 17 20 i believe it
[1:06:45] is
[1:06:46] jesus said when the son of man is being
[1:06:48] revealed
[1:06:49] not man the son of man not an
[1:06:52] organization
[1:06:53] the son of man the living the word
[1:06:56] living itself
[1:06:56] among the people how much stronger could
[1:07:00] you state those things
[1:07:01] i said these in 69 it didn't do any good
[1:07:09] will it today
[1:07:13] the word itself may flesh in you you are
[1:07:16] a reflection
[1:07:17] this hour the message reflection of it
[1:07:21] see you live again live the life that
[1:07:24] was in jesus christ you're in the
[1:07:25] presence of the son then to
[1:07:28] what happens to it what happens to that
[1:07:31] church
[1:07:32] finally listen that shock pulls away
[1:07:34] from that wheat
[1:07:35] when it begins to be manifested what
[1:07:38] happened the life that was in the shook
[1:07:40] went on out in the wheat
[1:07:42] the life won't change the carriers
[1:07:44] change they denominate see the blade the
[1:07:46] tassel of the show
[1:07:48] but the wheat can't change it's got to
[1:07:51] be a ministry that's
[1:07:52] exactly on the word like he was on the
[1:07:55] word like the first church was on the
[1:07:57] word spirit-filled
[1:07:58] word fed
[1:08:02] not denominational word fed
[1:08:06] let me get my notes i'm wondering where
[1:08:07] in the world i'm at now
[1:08:12] let me make a statement or two back up
[1:08:13] through here see someone must make
[1:08:15] manifest the word or seed for this day
[1:08:18] that's right now someone must do that
[1:08:20] someone must make manifest
[1:08:22] so that's our job the prophet done his
[1:08:26] job he brought the message thank god
[1:08:28] what greater honor could be than to
[1:08:31] stand there one day and us introduce
[1:08:33] him introduce us to jesus christ what
[1:08:36] greater thoughts could they be
[1:08:38] to give a man that much honor
[1:08:41] so close to god until he said one day he
[1:08:43] said if you call me jesus you're closer
[1:08:45] if you call me an antichrist
[1:08:47] now that's what he said
[1:08:51] and that's how close it was god used a
[1:08:54] man to bring you and i a message
[1:08:59] but yet do we believe it
[1:09:02] right do we believe it
[1:09:08] look at number 14 you know spoken word
[1:09:10] original seed
[1:09:12] now for the birth of the word is christ
[1:09:17] not a not a denom not a polluted
[1:09:20] with denominations the early church no
[1:09:23] denominations
[1:09:25] right holy church okay just the word and
[1:09:28] spirit irrigated
[1:09:29] right brother the god laid the word down
[1:09:32] like that and the holy spirit
[1:09:34] irrigated and there she went she went
[1:09:36] forth
[1:09:37] she brought forth children certainly but
[1:09:40] this church can't do it
[1:09:42] they talk about the organization they
[1:09:43] can't do it she's too denominated
[1:09:46] see she can't do it she's got the world
[1:09:48] mixed up with her
[1:09:49] look what they did and what did they do
[1:09:52] look at the last one
[1:09:55] that's not the last of the quotes but
[1:09:56] look at the the next one
[1:10:00] bert payne's 1965 124 page 1 page 27
[1:10:04] notice quickly now she is in that stage
[1:10:06] beyond the shadow of doubt
[1:10:08] we're in the ladies in church age now
[1:10:10] her messenger is promised in malachi the
[1:10:12] fourth chapter
[1:10:13] he's promised to do it and the message
[1:10:14] is to bring back the word
[1:10:16] bring the people back to the word birth
[1:10:19] to be
[1:10:20] she's to be delivered of a new birth
[1:10:22] from according to malachi 4.
[1:10:28] to be delivered of a new bird from
[1:10:29] according to malachi 4.
[1:10:34] now do you understand what i'm saying
[1:10:37] before we
[1:10:38] get on the rest of it
[1:10:42] see jesus christ
[1:10:46] the son of man was the original grain of
[1:10:49] wheat
[1:10:52] he came and talked to their disciples
[1:10:54] and told them
[1:10:56] and when the people came to say sirs we
[1:10:58] would see jesus brother
[1:10:59] and said they wanted to see god they
[1:11:01] wouldn't just come in to see jesus you
[1:11:02] know we want to see jesus
[1:11:04] they had heard that he was god and they
[1:11:06] wanted to see god
[1:11:08] all right he turned to him and he said
[1:11:10] unless the corn of wheat falls
[1:11:12] into the ground said it'll bite alone
[1:11:15] we said now if it does in other words
[1:11:17] you're going to kill me
[1:11:19] you're going to take my life you're
[1:11:21] going to be part of this program
[1:11:23] but it's going to be on the wrong side
[1:11:25] you're going to take my life and in
[1:11:26] doing that you're going to do the
[1:11:27] greatest honor could ever be because
[1:11:29] you're going to allow me to go into the
[1:11:30] ground
[1:11:32] and then i can come forth i might not be
[1:11:35] able to come forth as we say about it
[1:11:37] there were
[1:11:38] where peter said to to jesus said to
[1:11:40] peter who do men say i the son of man am
[1:11:42] he said dark to christ the son of the
[1:11:44] living god
[1:11:45] in other words a statement from me i say
[1:11:47] okay he didn't understand what jesus was
[1:11:48] talking about
[1:11:49] but jesus said upon this rock of who he
[1:11:52] was the christ the son of the living god
[1:11:54] i'll be on my church and the gates of
[1:11:57] hell will be against it but cannot
[1:11:59] prevail
[1:12:00] but one day i'll come back to it myself
[1:12:05] you see brother branham was not that one
[1:12:06] to come back i preached that to you
[1:12:08] where he was waiting
[1:12:10] there in the seals and then that great
[1:12:12] one
[1:12:13] came to open the seals
[1:12:18] because even the angel that brother
[1:12:19] random had there with him
[1:12:21] couldn't open the seals it didn't
[1:12:24] he was the one that called it the
[1:12:26] healing angel he's the one who called it
[1:12:28] a minor angel
[1:12:30] he was waiting on somebody that somebody
[1:12:33] was the lord jesus christ that came to
[1:12:35] brother branham
[1:12:37] to tell him those seals because it was
[1:12:38] nobody else knew about it
[1:12:40] because he was the son of man all right
[1:12:43] but now we've got to turn back to get
[1:12:45] back to where the faith of the fathers
[1:12:46] is
[1:12:48] before we can talk about son of man
[1:12:52] we must come forth as the son of god the
[1:12:54] faith of the fathers
[1:12:55] right uh the reasonable faith then we
[1:12:58] can talk about the son of man
[1:13:01] all right see but then the prophet
[1:13:04] people say well why is this oh well see
[1:13:06] the prophet had to bring the message and
[1:13:07] then go off the scene
[1:13:09] right because then
[1:13:12] he says it will be these seven thunders
[1:13:14] which were the seven
[1:13:16] what is it messenger of malachi 4 do two
[1:13:18] things 424 is that what it is church age
[1:13:20] book
[1:13:20] this message of malachi 4 would do two
[1:13:22] things one turn the hearts of the
[1:13:23] children back to faith the fathers to
[1:13:25] reveal the seven thunders which is
[1:13:27] revelation contained in the seven sealed
[1:13:28] it'll be these divinely revealed mystery
[1:13:30] truths that literally turn the hearts of
[1:13:31] the children back
[1:13:32] huh and see then he had to bring the
[1:13:35] message
[1:13:38] but then we've got the message to study
[1:13:40] until we become the message
[1:13:44] now learning the intellectually is not
[1:13:46] what we're talking about
[1:13:48] although that's a wonderful thing right
[1:13:54] don't you wish that you could remember
[1:13:56] everything the bible said
[1:13:58] right don't you wish you could remember
[1:14:01] everything the prophet said
[1:14:03] well you know you know the reason a lot
[1:14:05] of people don't remember they don't read
[1:14:06] it
[1:14:07] that may be dirty but
[1:14:12] but listen folks many many years ago
[1:14:17] 25 30 i tried to preach this about
[1:14:20] mary not being deceived that there was
[1:14:23] something to come
[1:14:26] and people back there oh yeah looking
[1:14:29] for something to come
[1:14:30] probably somebody you're trying to make
[1:14:32] himself something no i was telling what
[1:14:34] the prophet said
[1:14:35] well you know now the people are
[1:14:36] gradually catching on to that
[1:14:39] and i'm glad of it
[1:14:42] me i'm tickled to death
[1:14:46] that the people around the world are
[1:14:47] catching on to the message and finally
[1:14:49] getting into reading the message
[1:14:55] wouldn't like we was when we started i'd
[1:14:56] say something to the people and they'd
[1:14:57] say where broke around say that
[1:15:01] number one i said something they said
[1:15:03] well where'd he say it i said
[1:15:04] he said message so-and-so he said i just
[1:15:07] got through this in that tape and i
[1:15:08] didn't hear it
[1:15:10] i just went to the car and got the book
[1:15:11] turned to the page and said here and
[1:15:12] read it
[1:15:15] i don't know whether he slept through
[1:15:16] what is there or like some of you you
[1:15:18] know and missed it and then blame me for
[1:15:20] other things and say i said so and so
[1:15:25] but listen church this is no play purdy
[1:15:30] you've got to have the seed planted in
[1:15:32] the field before you can get the grain
[1:15:34] of corn
[1:15:35] and to do that there's a lot of stirring
[1:15:37] up in the ground there's a lot of
[1:15:38] plowing the
[1:15:39] the things you know it takes a while to
[1:15:41] prepare the soil
[1:15:43] well at least we ought to be into the
[1:15:44] time now that we can see the shock
[1:15:46] coming up and pulling loose
[1:15:48] right brother said when when the bride
[1:15:52] begins to say i and my father are one
[1:15:54] and those other things he said the shook
[1:15:56] will pull away
[1:16:00] all right but that don't mean it's fully
[1:16:01] mature does it right
[1:16:03] the seed's got to lay in the presence of
[1:16:05] the sun to ripen
[1:16:08] now here's the point do you understand
[1:16:12] that the bride must be or at least
[1:16:13] understand what i say
[1:16:16] that the bride must be the grain of corn
[1:16:18] that went into the ground reproduced
[1:16:20] again
[1:16:20] exactly like it was and this grain will
[1:16:23] be so mature
[1:16:24] like him until now it's not going to
[1:16:26] happen
[1:16:28] but you could take it and put it in the
[1:16:29] ground and it bring forth
[1:16:32] it's not going to happen because it's
[1:16:33] not going to take place this time
[1:16:35] this time it's going up in a rapture
[1:16:38] when it's fully matured it'll take a
[1:16:40] rapture
[1:16:40] the grain of wheat mary was not that she
[1:16:43] only carried the baby
[1:16:45] the baby was the grain of wheat we are
[1:16:48] not to give birth to a baby we're to
[1:16:50] give birth to a full grown
[1:16:51] man the son of man the word of god
[1:16:57] now
[1:17:01] you think the bride don't have nothing
[1:17:02] to do with it
[1:17:08] you know i said all of that he said
[1:17:11] brother dale
[1:17:13] you read revelations 5 1
[1:17:17] 2 7 you ain't said a word about it
[1:17:23] you just you just read that well
[1:17:27] i wrote it down like this i'm glad you
[1:17:28] thought that
[1:17:32] let's read
[1:17:35] let's read something your prophecy
[1:17:43] we've talked about the grain of wheat
[1:17:44] we've talked about the other things
[1:17:47] where does that lamb come from that
[1:17:49] takes the book
[1:17:52] on the lamb lord jesus christ amen
[1:17:55] but where does he come from
[1:18:00] i'm trying to preach over again what i
[1:18:02] just preached that the grain of wheat
[1:18:03] must come back again
[1:18:04] in multiple forms all right so now watch
[1:18:07] it
[1:18:08] where does that lamb come from
[1:18:12] the breach 1963 317 evening paragraph
[1:18:15] 16.
[1:18:18] all right john hadn't noticed the lamb
[1:18:20] before
[1:18:22] you know here i was reading revelations
[1:18:24] 1.
[1:18:25] he talks about this the different things
[1:18:28] in revelation 5 excuse me
[1:18:30] and he talks about different things you
[1:18:31] want to read it
[1:18:35] he talks about the book written within
[1:18:37] he talked about one sitting on the
[1:18:38] throne he talks about all kind of things
[1:18:39] but he hasn't seen the lamb
[1:18:42] until you get over the verse uh really
[1:18:45] to him to see the lamb was verse six
[1:18:49] the messenger picks up in in the other
[1:18:51] verses but watching what he's saying
[1:18:53] john hadn't noticed this lamb before you
[1:18:55] know here
[1:18:56] he he hadn't been mentioned before
[1:19:00] nowhere had it been mentioned john
[1:19:02] didn't see it all over the heavens as
[1:19:04] he's looking
[1:19:06] but here it come forward notice where it
[1:19:09] came forth
[1:19:10] where did it come from where did the
[1:19:14] lamb come from
[1:19:15] it came from the father strong where he
[1:19:18] had been seated
[1:19:19] since he had been slain and raised up
[1:19:23] now remember to start of the message you
[1:19:25] remember this morning what's the
[1:19:26] father's throne
[1:19:28] son of god baptism of the holy ghost
[1:19:32] son of god father strong the lamb comes
[1:19:35] from
[1:19:36] the father's from work from the church
[1:19:37] ages
[1:19:39] he'd been slain and raised up raised up
[1:19:42] sit on the right hand of god ever
[1:19:44] living to make intercessions amen raised
[1:19:46] there today as an intercessor with his
[1:19:47] own blood to make intercession
[1:19:48] upon the ignorance of the people now oh
[1:19:51] that's the one i'm dependent on
[1:19:53] he was covered with bleach and the
[1:19:54] bleach of the forgiveness of sin
[1:19:57] keep on reading 16 a mighty god unveiled
[1:20:01] 64 629
[1:20:04] page 9. we find that after his death
[1:20:08] burial and resurrection he came on the
[1:20:09] day of pentecost the son of god
[1:20:11] god the spirit and the form holy spirit
[1:20:13] what was he doing he was changing
[1:20:15] himself
[1:20:15] making himself known to his people in a
[1:20:17] different form like the holy spirit
[1:20:19] which is god
[1:20:20] he came to deal through the seven church
[1:20:23] ages as son of god the holy spirit
[1:20:25] but in the millennium he comes as son of
[1:20:27] david to sit on the throne of david
[1:20:30] he was to take the throne of david he's
[1:20:32] on the father's strong
[1:20:34] now and then he said he that overcometh
[1:20:37] shall sit with me
[1:20:38] on my throne as i've overcome and sit
[1:20:40] with my father on here
[1:20:41] so in the millennium he be son of david
[1:20:43] what is it the same god all the time
[1:20:45] just changing his mask
[1:20:48] where did he come from what did that
[1:20:51] lamb look like
[1:20:53] according to what we read in the bible
[1:20:55] it had seven horns and seven eyes funny
[1:20:57] looking lamb
[1:21:02] funny looking lamb a lamb you ever seen
[1:21:05] a lamb with seven horns and seven eyes
[1:21:07] now i've seen them with a couple of eyes
[1:21:08] and a couple of horns but
[1:21:11] never seen that funny-looking lamb
[1:21:16] and remember now i don't remember where
[1:21:18] i've got it here or not but just
[1:21:19] remember
[1:21:20] send the seal book brother and said just
[1:21:21] don't he wouldn't know lambs because he
[1:21:23] took the book
[1:21:27] he's not a lay on there
[1:21:30] it's the only one that could open the
[1:21:32] book
[1:21:33] who is the only one that can open the
[1:21:35] book the son of man
[1:21:38] all right so now let's read revelation
[1:21:41] chapter 5 part
[1:21:42] 2 1961 618 paragraph 204
[1:21:46] seven seals seven spirits seven angels
[1:21:48] seven horns and seven churches
[1:21:50] see seven seven sevens there's five
[1:21:54] sevens which seven is perfection five is
[1:21:56] grace
[1:21:58] god's grace to his seven church ages
[1:22:02] his seven messenger men men his spirit
[1:22:06] his seven spirits from god now we know
[1:22:08] they're not seven spirits of god what is
[1:22:09] it it's down through seven church ages
[1:22:11] right
[1:22:12] and the seven planned seals of
[1:22:14] redemption we're in right now
[1:22:16] the seven horns means seven ages
[1:22:19] because a horn means a kingdom you
[1:22:22] remember
[1:22:22] the crown that come upon the beast
[1:22:26] horn in daniel and so forth it means a
[1:22:27] kingdom are
[1:22:29] are seven ages and remember jesus said
[1:22:32] some fell asleep in the first watch one
[1:22:33] watch another watching the next watch
[1:22:35] the next what's next next and poem down
[1:22:37] to the seventh watch
[1:22:39] and in the seventh watch the bridegroom
[1:22:41] come then all of them awaken
[1:22:43] remember that so it's seven ages as this
[1:22:46] that was the seven
[1:22:47] horns and the seven churches
[1:22:50] are seven dispensations or the body of
[1:22:52] believers
[1:22:54] is just as perfect as it can be jeremiah
[1:22:58] my the book ages how it was redeemed no
[1:23:02] okay go to the bricks
[1:23:03] seven horns with the seven churches see
[1:23:06] the seven church ages because that was
[1:23:08] the lamb's protection
[1:23:10] what he protected his rights with on
[1:23:12] earth as a
[1:23:13] god sent group of people that's
[1:23:14] protected
[1:23:16] see the horn of the lamb seven eyes are
[1:23:18] the seven messengers of seven church
[1:23:20] ages seven eyes seven seers
[1:23:22] going down breach 1963 317
[1:23:26] e page 102 that was 101.
[1:23:29] i read just above there and now he's
[1:23:32] coming down and he's talking about
[1:23:33] zerubbabel
[1:23:34] with those seven those are the eyes of
[1:23:36] the lord who run two and four through
[1:23:38] the whole earth
[1:23:39] the seven eyes e eyes mean seeing sin
[1:23:42] means prophets seers
[1:23:43] this lamb had seven horns and on each
[1:23:46] horn had an eye
[1:23:47] seven eyes what is it christ
[1:23:50] and his bride seven church ages
[1:23:54] out of there with seven prophets that
[1:23:56] went forth seven seers eyes
[1:23:59] so the last one must be a seer all right
[1:24:02] now where did the lamb come from
[1:24:09] the lamb come from the church ages
[1:24:13] well brother i tell you what now
[1:24:19] i just don't see how that could be well
[1:24:22] you're gonna argue with the prophet
[1:24:27] that's your business
[1:24:31] i call us a bunch of
[1:24:34] ignoramuses
[1:24:39] it don't take the devil to destroy this
[1:24:41] message
[1:24:43] all it takes is a bunch of preachers
[1:24:48] devil don't even have to do nothing he
[1:24:49] just says back in life
[1:24:56] cause he don't even have to move his
[1:24:57] hand
[1:25:01] i said one time listen to a guy for a
[1:25:03] long time
[1:25:04] that his claim and he was there with
[1:25:06] brother branham and brother brown called
[1:25:07] his name and everything hunted with him
[1:25:09] and saw all kind of things
[1:25:11] and he spent quite a time trying to
[1:25:12] prove that a mule could have a
[1:25:15] an offspring
[1:25:18] he had a book that showed it you know
[1:25:21] this mule had an offspring
[1:25:25] but you know what i was sitting there
[1:25:26] thinking i thought is he trying to build
[1:25:29] a message up or tear it down now which
[1:25:30] one is it i mean that's all i could
[1:25:32] think
[1:25:33] right why why didn't he say well now
[1:25:36] listen this your mu wasn't just a mule
[1:25:38] it was it looked like a mule but it had
[1:25:40] all the parts of a female in the right
[1:25:42] order
[1:25:45] and there was more mules you know most
[1:25:47] people don't know that
[1:25:49] jenny's my muse they call them
[1:25:54] but you see was he trying to turn the
[1:25:55] message down or was he trying to build
[1:25:58] it up
[1:25:59] well i showed the prophet was wrong
[1:26:02] project said a mule couldn't have one i
[1:26:04] showed right there i did was that what
[1:26:05] he was he trying to do
[1:26:07] he never went on and said those things
[1:26:09] it was showing that that wasn't a mule
[1:26:14] that that was a freak of nature that
[1:26:16] happened
[1:26:20] see
[1:26:25] the preachers of this message are the
[1:26:26] ones that destroys the bible it's not
[1:26:28] the laity
[1:26:29] amen i never had trouble with laity
[1:26:34] i have trouble with preachers
[1:26:38] well i'll tell you what i just can't see
[1:26:40] how that lamb
[1:26:42] was coming from the church ages but
[1:26:45] where'd it come from
[1:26:49] because see you're looking like that
[1:26:50] you're trying to find a lamb that
[1:26:53] walking out from somewhere and it's got
[1:26:55] to do this and
[1:26:58] you're not looking at the bible
[1:27:03] the bible was written 2 000 years ago
[1:27:07] you know give or take all right
[1:27:12] and it talked about a lamb that would
[1:27:14] come forth
[1:27:17] your prophet is explaining what those
[1:27:19] things are
[1:27:22] not telling you how did a lamb come from
[1:27:25] the church ages up through the eight and
[1:27:27] out and then at lamb walked out and went
[1:27:28] up took the book
[1:27:30] he's explaining what happens in the ages
[1:27:33] and what takes place
[1:27:38] whatever you think about azusa street or
[1:27:40] whatever you think about luther wesley
[1:27:42] them
[1:27:43] they gave birth to the word of their age
[1:27:45] and that was all they was responsible
[1:27:47] for
[1:27:54] as i said a moment ago read it 464 seal
[1:27:56] book
[1:27:57] you'll find brother brown talks about a
[1:27:59] prophet coming
[1:28:00] on azusa street
[1:28:03] it wasn't the one-eyed black man but he
[1:28:06] was the messenger to the age
[1:28:09] the prophet was the lord jesus christ
[1:28:12] who came back
[1:28:14] then the name began to be restored and
[1:28:16] then the things begin to open
[1:28:19] and your prophet is explaining now where
[1:28:21] this lamb comes from
[1:28:24] it's when the bride gives birth to that
[1:28:26] grain
[1:28:27] yeah but we're here and
[1:28:30] they just got me all confused no i got
[1:28:34] you where you was and no you're confused
[1:28:38] you were already confused or don't
[1:28:41] know exactly what i'm saying is the
[1:28:42] truth
[1:28:46] it's not just a lamb coming forth it's
[1:28:49] not a seven horns and seven eyes it's
[1:28:51] where that's coming from
[1:28:56] we must give birth to the word amen amen
[1:29:02] well brother brown's already took the
[1:29:04] book now where did he take the book
[1:29:07] see now what you're doing
[1:29:10] no he's already explained the book
[1:29:14] that's the way i see it he didn't have
[1:29:17] to take the book
[1:29:18] and do anything right
[1:29:22] he said well it did over here yeah and
[1:29:23] then one that i know that was took was
[1:29:25] sure what's bitter in the belly if you
[1:29:27] want to make out of him
[1:29:29] that's all i know about it but you see
[1:29:32] that corn of wheat that went into the
[1:29:34] ground would come back again in the end
[1:29:35] time
[1:29:36] it doesn't matter whether it's on the
[1:29:37] earth or not
[1:29:40] and then undo it
[1:29:44] it was god's way of bringing it right
[1:29:47] and he would bring her down through the
[1:29:49] ages and we give birth to the word
[1:29:52] azusa street pentecost gave birth
[1:29:55] to this end time word as a child
[1:30:00] your prophet picked it up and began
[1:30:02] right there
[1:30:04] and went right on to bring the word
[1:30:08] but he couldn't do nothing but a
[1:30:09] restoration of the faith of the fathers
[1:30:12] up until 63
[1:30:13] and then the seals would come and break
[1:30:18] he said oh if that lamb could precede
[1:30:20] all the way from glory
[1:30:22] and come tonight revelations 5 he said
[1:30:26] is the most sublime or something
[1:30:29] most sublime scripture in the whole
[1:30:31] bible
[1:30:33] i don't know i might continue in
[1:30:34] revelation 5 just a minute but
[1:30:36] you know another message but
[1:30:41] because it shows us
[1:30:44] like i've told you if you want to see
[1:30:45] yourself read the book of revelations
[1:30:48] the book we were told not to read
[1:30:53] but the symbolics
[1:30:57] there had to be seven church ages
[1:31:00] and those church ages would produce the
[1:31:02] lamb
[1:31:06] and that lamb then could take the book
[1:31:08] but it's not
[1:31:09] taking a book see that's what we're
[1:31:11] looking at we're looking at some kind of
[1:31:13] a thing that's got somebody come up and
[1:31:15] take a book or glam take a book or just
[1:31:17] take a book or that
[1:31:18] look at the revelation of god's word
[1:31:21] amen look what he's revealing not what
[1:31:24] something
[1:31:25] i don't understand that symbol because
[1:31:27] it's 7179 that's church
[1:31:32] you mean them denominations had
[1:31:34] something to do with the none of them
[1:31:35] denominations
[1:31:37] in the bride
[1:31:40] you want me to quote brother random one
[1:31:42] that really knocked me for a loop
[1:31:44] many many years until the lord spoke to
[1:31:47] me about it
[1:31:50] i knew the order of events and how
[1:31:52] everything laid
[1:31:53] and how the bad this was way back what
[1:31:55] 200 years ago almost or something
[1:31:58] and coming down from john smith and all
[1:32:01] of that and
[1:32:02] alexander campbell it keeps coming on
[1:32:03] down it's got to come through the
[1:32:04] methodist because the baptist was
[1:32:06] between the
[1:32:07] the um lutherans and the the uh
[1:32:11] is way on back i've listened to a tape
[1:32:15] one day and i really had to run it back
[1:32:16] and listen
[1:32:17] look around said the baptist is just to
[1:32:19] become a denomination
[1:32:25] i'll be glad to find that for you he
[1:32:28] said they just become a denomination
[1:32:32] but we thought when wesley come forth
[1:32:33] they denominated and died
[1:32:38] and the biggest portion did
[1:32:41] but you see what caused denominations to
[1:32:43] be denominations is when they rejected
[1:32:45] this message
[1:32:48] when they turned down this message
[1:32:50] whether it be in the 40s or the 50s or
[1:32:52] whether it be
[1:32:53] when they turned this message down
[1:32:55] that's where they denominated and died
[1:32:57] right there
[1:32:59] right see he was allowed to go among
[1:33:01] them for a long time
[1:33:04] and preach among the people but then one
[1:33:07] day they put him out didn't
[1:33:12] you see what i'm talking about we're
[1:33:13] looking at a lamb taking a book we're
[1:33:15] looking at something like a throne
[1:33:17] brother bradley said you know what he
[1:33:18] said about it
[1:33:21] he said he climbed up on the throne and
[1:33:22] sat down right
[1:33:26] that's in the seal book he took the book
[1:33:29] out of the hand of the one sitting on
[1:33:30] the throne climbed up on the throne and
[1:33:32] sat down
[1:33:32] well that makes two people sitting on
[1:33:34] the throne
[1:33:39] that's not right what did he do
[1:33:44] the church ages gave birth to the word
[1:33:46] and the word goes right up and climbed
[1:33:48] up
[1:33:48] and set down on the throne
[1:33:52] and the father is strong because that's
[1:33:54] not his strong revelation 5 is not as
[1:33:56] strong
[1:33:59] you got to get over chapter 19 to find
[1:34:01] his throne
[1:34:04] that he climbed up on the throne and
[1:34:05] said i am
[1:34:07] i believe that soul's in prison
[1:34:10] he climbed up on the throne and said i
[1:34:12] am
[1:34:13] in other words he became the one on the
[1:34:15] throne we were the ones that dethroned
[1:34:18] him he was never off the throne we
[1:34:20] dethroned him by our doctrines when we
[1:34:22] made it to trinitarianisms and things
[1:34:25] and we dethroned him you ever heard the
[1:34:27] message raising jesus from history
[1:34:31] you were to get that sermon and listen
[1:34:32] to it
[1:34:34] raising jesus from history what's he
[1:34:37] saying
[1:34:40] see back down through there we took him
[1:34:42] off the throne and made him a trinity
[1:34:44] that's what they've done at nicaea 325
[1:34:46] a.d they took him off the throne as
[1:34:48] almighty god and made him a denomination
[1:34:50] i mean made him a trinity
[1:34:55] it's our revelation brother gary's got
[1:34:57] to be restored not just some kind of a
[1:34:59] throne somewhere
[1:35:01] that's right not a lamb going forth and
[1:35:04] taking a book
[1:35:05] it's a revelation of what god has done
[1:35:07] among us
[1:35:09] to show who we are
[1:35:12] show what he thinks of his bride
[1:35:16] she's him made manifest
[1:35:20] brother callie preached many many years
[1:35:22] ago he that hath made us and not we
[1:35:23] ourselves
[1:35:24] we are the people in the sheep of his
[1:35:26] pastor he thinks i can't remember that
[1:35:27] good
[1:35:29] that's probably been 30 years ago
[1:35:35] it is he that has made us
[1:35:39] back on these things when you bring that
[1:35:42] that grain of wheat right back
[1:35:46] you're standing there in revelations 5
[1:35:51] with a lamb with a book in his hand
[1:35:58] seeing jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:36:00] today and forever listen
[1:36:02] come on brother
[1:36:06] sorry to take a little bit longer this
[1:36:07] afternoon but just wanted to get the
[1:36:09] point across
[1:36:14] i hope you followed my line proving that
[1:36:17] he was a
[1:36:18] that the the grain of wheat is the bride
[1:36:20] and then proving the bride is the
[1:36:22] man with seven horns and seven eyes
[1:36:25] that's where he comes from
[1:36:28] he comes from the bride to do those
[1:36:31] things
[1:36:34] well i thought that was off up in heaven
[1:36:35] up there somewhere but yeah
[1:36:37] one of these days we'll find out that
[1:36:40] what i've told you years ago i quit
[1:36:41] trying to go to heaven
[1:36:43] that's been about 30 years ago and the
[1:36:44] lord spoke to me about it i said well i
[1:36:46] don't want to go to heaven
[1:36:48] i imagine that really put it in a lot of
[1:36:50] people's cranium couch
[1:36:52] to hear me say it but i've meant it and
[1:36:54] i still mean it because i believe god's
[1:36:56] got to come here before we can go there
[1:37:02] let's see we don't want to believe what
[1:37:03] the prophet had to say
[1:37:05] what do we got i tried 61 in the red
[1:37:08] book
[1:37:09] 61 anybody have an 8 cause i believe
[1:37:12] that same god is still here
[1:37:14] i believe he heals if he can deliver a
[1:37:18] message and keep it straight
[1:37:20] he can heal the body
[1:37:29] and righteousness i dare not trust
[1:37:45] that lamb is here
[1:37:59] she gave my birth to a baby mary done
[1:38:02] that
[1:38:03] we must give birth to a man
[1:38:09] allowed to take them
[1:38:14] in other
[1:38:28] what the prophet
[1:38:42] i'm concerned with what god gave that
[1:38:45] prophet
[1:38:46] the word that he could give it to me
[1:38:57] what do you think
[1:39:24] is
[1:39:38] is
[1:39:52] on that lamb it's got to be that grain
[1:39:55] of wheat
[1:39:56] that son of man
[1:40:03] is that lamb birth from the ages
[1:40:09] the bride has had something to do
