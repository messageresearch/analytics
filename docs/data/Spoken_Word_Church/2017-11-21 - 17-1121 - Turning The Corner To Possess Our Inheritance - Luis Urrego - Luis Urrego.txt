========================================

amen and I'm here for the word Amen I don't know about you but I'm here for the word tonight a man praise God so we had to come to church much quicker this week but that's all right amen you know what we should be excited when those doors are open amen there's nothing better than to to receive Amen what God has in store for us through the ministry in this hour amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so listen let's just turn this to Philippians chapter 3 Philippians chapter 3 and we'll start with this scripture now I have a lot of content that I want to talk about this evening and God just help I don't know if I'll be able to get through it but you just pray for me amen because it just it doesn't matter how many times you get up here in the pulpit you still get nervous I told brother Bob earlier today I said well Bob I got I'm getting those pulpit heebie-jeebies you know and I mean you just get them you know but I mean you know I guess it's because God wants you to just submit to him hey man let him do the talking praise God amen let's just bow our heads real quick our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the opportunity father to be able to speak your word Lord and we appreciate Heavenly Father what you're doing in this our Lord Jesus through a many member body called the bride father God thank you Lord that you're still alive and well Lord and father God we just ask now Lord that you would just intervene father God for every need that was mentioned here this evening may you Heavenly Father heal the sick ones father God touched those that need a physical touch from You Lord God sister Anna this evening Lord and also little Abbey grace may you touch them Lord right now where they're at Lord heal them father God raised him up Lord and Emily father any other request that was mentioned here bless those that may be still on their way father and you were just leading goddess this evening Lord and help us to have open ears receptive ears to receive father God something that would help us in our spiritual walk Lord anoint my lips Lord God and help me to just only save father what is edifying for your people Lord and what glorifies your name Lord we love you we commit ourselves into service into your hands now have your way father God we ask and we invite your presence in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise God amen Philippians chapter 3 it says but what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ started at verse 7 verse a yay-yeah doubtless I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ this is pretty strong words there that he uses amen and be found in him not having my mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith amen that's it's the righteousness we want amen that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either we're already perfect but look at this but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which I also am apprehended of Christ Jesus amen brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind amen and reaching forth unto those things which are before amen there's great promises in store for the believer in this hour amen taking what God has already given us amen through a profit in this day through his word in the ages and and bringing it together with what God is daunted to do in this hour a man praise God not forgetting one thing not taking one thing over the other no taking both things amen and see what God wants to do in this hour amen the message for your day press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as many as be perfect be thus minded and they've been in if in anything ye ye be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you nevertheless we're two we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing a man praise God you you Lord I had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this evening amen praise God appreciate the Lord and I appreciate the opportunity to be able to minister to his bride amen how many believe you're the Bride of Christ hey mate well if you don't confess is like brother Dale said this this past Sunday if you don't confess you're healing if God can only heal you as much as you believe that he's a healer same thing got to save you as much as you think he's a savior to you a man God doesn't pull us to do anything yes well I like what brother Branham said he's a gentleman amen it doesn't push you to do anything amen but the more you grab of him the more you're gonna obtain of him a man the more you have to you grab a man the more you get ahold of and if you come here with just a little cup that's how he's gonna feel but if you come here with a big old fifty gallon barrel he'll feel that the point is that he'll fill it it's just whatever vessel you come with amen praise the Lord amen so just real quick I would just want to ask you all before I before I get into the message that you all pray for us Lord willing next month we're going to be traveling to Honduras and Nicaragua so we've I've been invited the last two years by a brother there the brother that we help support here a couple of months ago to minister down in Hondo and I think I got the opportunity to go this this coming month so you pray for us my wife and I will be going and our girls will be staying with my sisters in South Carolina so it'd be it would be uh it'd be I think it'd be a blessing and I think it's a bit be a time so I want to be able to check on that on that work that the brother is doing and maybe bring back a report some pictures and also just get an opportunity to minister and some some churches down in those areas amen I love the people down there I'm telling you they're there they're about my age range and their some of them are pastors a lot of Ministers and they're just so on fire for God you know it's just when you get around them you know it's just it makes you feel this little to think we're so spoiled here in America and they're up there at twenty thirty years old twenty-five twenty thirty thirty-five years old up there preaching to Indian tribes up in the mountains ten hours away from civilization and they're dedicated they're dedicated amen it makes me feel like what am i doing for the Lord amen so I want to be able to support that amen so so you just pray for us a man we'll be leaving out on the 13th Lord will end of December and just be there for about eight days and right after that we'll be heading to Canada spend Christmas time there and then we want to be back for for watch night service Lord willin amen but we haven't we haven't been able to come to watch night service like in the last two years so this year we want to try to make it amen praise the Lord so tonight I want to speak about this low topic here and I want to title it turning the corner to possess our inheritance hey man I'm gonna believe God is moving in this hour how many believe that you need to move wherever God is moving amen and you know when you're driving and you're out on the road it's so easy to drive when everything is when you're in a straight straight road you know and there's no turns there's no corners there's no nothing but as soon as you get to an intersection if you're if you're not experienced that driving that's when it gets a little tough because these if there's a four-way stop you have to look both ways you have to and then you have to see where you're going to turn and in order for you to be able to make that turn you have to make sure everything is okay behind you around you to make sure that you can get to the destination where you need to get amen you need to know how to turn the corner God's always turning corners amen even in this day even after God gave us the message of the hour God is still turning corners after that and some people don't want to turn corners to this day they just want to stick with what God did in the 60s and the 50s and don't want to turn their corner but I'm gonna tell you you're gonna be left behind you better turn the corner or else you're gonna be left behind because God is moving he's not going to wait for you the children of Israel when they were when they were walking with with Israel with Moses under the under Moses they had to not put their stake on a on their tent and thinking uh you know we're just gonna leave it there forever no it was just a temporary thing because the pillar of fire was moving the cloud was moving everybody Moses was moving and you're just gonna be left behind amen so God is moving in this hour and and Saints you know I I'm just you know that I think Satan might been Satan but you know I've been really fighting about this preaching this message but it's just some things that God has has been working with me lately and you know we don't fight against flesh and blood in this hour I just want you to I want I want to make that clear we don't fight against flesh and blood in this hour but we fight against spirits and powers that are in the air that are anointing individuals amen to try to stop us amen from reaching our inheritance in this hour and it may be so ever religious and they may be coming under the name of this message but you better be careful you better be careful from this hour so I might say some strong things and I like brother Dale says you know he says he's blunt but I believe it's better to be blunt than to pity powder around around the edges you know better just to say how things are and then and and and if you if you don't if you don't like it then you pray for me amen praise God amen but I may say some things and I may I say them with utmost respect to the prophet of this hour to the ministry the fivefold ministering this hour brother Dale that's not what I'm trying to do I'm not coming against physical individuals they man I'm kind of making against spirits amen they're taking a hold ever so slightly in this hour amen and we better be careful Saints we better watch out by the word and what the prophet has told us what we need to be looking out in this hour because let me tell you Judas came out from the myth from the ministry that was it that day Judas walked with Jesus cast the devil's out healed the sick and done all these things under that power that Christ had given them back in Matthew chapter 10 but look what happened it came out from amongst them to do what he did and you know the rest of the story amen so if there's gonna be any deception in this hour it's not gonna come from the from the Pentecostals it's not gonna come from the Presbyterian from the Baptist you and I know where we are standing at least we should I can't get deceived by a Baptist doctrine I hope you can't the otherwise you need to come here and repent get get the new birth because you need the new birth if you can get deceived by a Presbyterian out here you know you need to know where you're standing you need to know that you have the Holy Ghost in this hour you need to know that you're born again any men but if there's gonna be any deception in this hour is gonna come from amongst the same message in the name of this message praise God amen so you know God is always moving and of course the children of Israel they there's transitions that were taking place from one place to another and and we know that the law was only a shadow a man of things to come praise God Hebrews 10:4 1:4 and I gave the brothers back there these scriptures so if they can pull them up because I want you to see them was just when we were reading them a man I believe it has more effect when you're listening and when you're reading at the same time Amen praise God but look what the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 10 it says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect I want you to the scriptures and the quotes that were reading I want you to look at him in light of what's going on in this hour ready men because God is just as concerned in this of what's going on in this day as he was concerned in the 50s and the 60s but let me tell you God is moving God is turning corners and stews and some people are just like the children of Israel we're too comfortable where we are we can't move on we can't go obtain that inheritance that's just too difficult I'm just gonna sit at home and listen to the tapes and that's it no you're not gonna be able to get anywhere that way you're not gonna be able to get anywhere that way not in this hour not in this out because let me tell you saying it won't be fair to us to our our children that God is that that that that is being taught in this day because look we have children that we want to raise them up in the admonition of the Lord and I want to know what God is doing in this hour day amen it's great to tell them what God did back in the 40s 50s and 60s 70s 80s and 90s but I want to be able to tell them and to be able for them to experience what God is doing in this hard day amen and we're going to read that later on in Joshua chapter 4 where they have to put a monument or they have to put a sign with the twelve stones after they cross the river Jordan amen to let no to show the future generations of what God had done in our day amen amen I don't want to get too far too ahead amen but God is concerned about not just this generation not just the generation that was before he's concerned about your generation and what he's doing now he's thinking about the future generations as well because let me tell you says this is about the third or fourth generation since this is the town since the brother Branham was here they're worried about around the third generation and some a lot of us came into the message at that time I came straight from the denomination into the message but my wife was born in the message a lot of the young people here today children today are born in this message and that's all they know some of them all they know is just a secondhand experience that's how they know we just come to the message church they never experienced a Baptist Church they've never experienced a Pentecostal church they don't know what all that is about I've been through that but the dale's been through the Baptist see you know some of us have believed your sister Gail you Presbyterians you know some of us have come through those things and we we're thankful what God has brought us through but let me tell you young people let me tell you those who were born in this message and this is how you know you need to get an experience for yourself pretty man you need to know God for yourself and what God is doing well in this hour amen and God what God wants you to fulfill but in order for you to do to to obtain that you need to be born again and you need to know that you're born again amen praise the Lord amen brother Branham says here in the message the church choose in law for grace he says you cannot break the types and shadows of God that's what Israel done in the natural that's what they've done in the spiritual and we realize that those things happen to Israel remember looking at things from from where we are in this day now they've happened to the church today just as they did then and we're about the end of the road now brethren do you believe that I know this thing's winding down Saints it's time that something happened I want to cross Jordan brother Branham says don't you Amen over into the Promised Land where we can see amen we've seen good things God has been good to us we're not complaining I'm out of here with you I'm out here on these things with you but brethren let's put ourselves together and go over we must go over we must go over we must turn that corner a man that God is turning praise God a man if you're looking to the word you'll see when the word is turning the corner amen you'll see what God is moving if you're looking but if you're looking to a man or if you're looking to just something that's outside of the word you're not going to see that word moving and that's what I'm afraid a lot of people as how they're doing in this ours just look into a man a man that is already dead and gone and his ministry has passed amen we've got to be looking to the word that's moving in this hour we don't we're not looking to the man we're looking to the to the message that the man brought that's what we're looking to that's what we need to look at but in this our Saints there's a lot of people that that have lifted up brother Branham to a pedestal in such a way that it's they're almost worshiping him now and be littering the fivefold ministry and not thinking anything about what God is doing through a fivefold ministry in this hour believe it and then on the other hand there's those they are up lifting the fivefold ministry in such a way where they're worshiping that man that pasture and belittling what God did through brother Branham and this our day but you let me tell you Joshua took both of those things and put a balance to it amen and you'll see that here in just a moment there's a balance to all things things God is the God of balance amen God is the God of balance and he always works in balance praise God amen that's the reason Saints why you need to know just as much as there's branagh mites they're also like I've heard here before there's loo lights there's also there could be Dale lights you know what Saints you need to know God for yourself amen you need to know God for yourself you need to have an experience with God I'm very comfortable because brother Dale's preaching the word and breath away these preaching the word and I know they're right are you man but you don't go home and study what they've said what if one day Amen god forbid god forbid that brother Dale says something that's out contrary outside of the word and you just say hey man because I know he can't never preach wrong gay men I know he can never go wrong because you don't go and study it for yourself then you're a daylight right amen praise God you need to know God for yourself brother Dale that's out of respect God with that's what we need to pray for our brothers are the faithful ministry that they continue to preach the Word of God amen cuz Satan is very sly in this our Saints he's very sly in this our now the shadow the shadow has to match the thing cast in the shadow closely right I wish there was something here you know if I was casting a shadow here wow this is not good but here's a shadow there all right you see the shadow here and you see that's not a good example but when you see the shadow when you see the shadow it's it's kind of showing what the image is but that's not the reality amen the reality is me standing right here amen that's the reality because now you know when I get closer the shadow and the and the reality meet then you could see everything much more clearer amen and so that's what the Old Testament and the law was was a shadow of what the new was coming amen when Jesus Christ stepped on the scene now you could see what those prophets were talking about amen in full in full color amen right they're standing with you you could even touch his his his his hand his his beard everything a man it was vivid it was very detailed amen praise God so Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new amen amen and and so being that that that the law Amen is a shadow of things to come or their Old Testament thing is things to come I you know I look at the law as you know the message for our day amen you can take that however you want to amen but I know where I'm standing they men praise God brother Dale has taught here and saying the ministry has taught here he meant a lot of people are just stuck on what brother Branham preached during this time amen but they cannot get to this right here they can't cross over amen amen to get to it and they're just stuck on the do's and don'ts the long hair the long dresses that the clothes line religion but they cannot move on with what God is doing and this hour day amen so that to me is kind of like the law a man that's just a shadow amen I'm waiting for the reality for that of what brother Branham preached to come into manifestation in my life amen for that shadow a man to come in to fulfill this in my fulfillment in my body amen in your body I don't know do you want that or not I I certainly do amen praise God Butler Branham says here in the message turning northward amen now the law served its purpose amen it was alright in its day the law did alright in its day it served its purpose so has the denominations done all right amen it's all right in the in its purpose but remember the law never took them to the promised land Joshua took them over grace not long and neither will do the nomination any denomination ever take the Church of God over neither will any current denomination take any any of you over either I'm talking about denomination is amongst this message amen there will never take you over no tape ministry will take you over nothing like that will take you over amen you gotta be moving with what God is doing in this out right man because Saints a lot of people are incredible things that I'm hearing talking about putting brother Brennan back in the pulpit and things like that to me that sounds like spiritualism that's what the Catholic Church practices you will never have Bertha Brennan back in the pulpit physically amen I listen to brother Branham every day you can go to our house and why will I listen to brother Branham every day I always had brother Branham playing all the time but don't ever expect and come to me saying that we went over and we listened to brother Branham and I know brother Branham died back in 1965 amen praise God I want to know what God said amen to a fivefold ministry in this hour no I'm not I'm not I I wanna I want to hear him and what God is doing through the Holy Spirit amen through the people they meant not just through the fivefold ministry but even through you God speaks through you to sister Gail God could speak to you God could speak to you sister Charlotte brother Dan and you all are we're all ministers and priests in this hour Amen praise God not just not just through the five oh man we are ministering in some way or another amen maybe that might hurt some of you but I'm I'm sorry if it did and neither will the denomination Nina denomination never take the Church of God over it'll be the grace of God that shed abroad in our hearts by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll take us to the promised land into the fullness of God's blessings certainly it is they make a fatal mistake when they do those things it served its purpose was very well but the time come when it wasn't no good no more God let it die out so he could take Grace and take them across now you think about what brother Branham is saying this is your prophet saying this God let his own word die out God let it die out so he could take Grace and take them across and positionally place them into their places and the promise thing so will the grace of God put every member every member prophets teachers so forth not a denomination can't do that and not any current denomination and art they can do that either amen so there was transitions in the Old Testament amen we see him also from one judge to another when they had the time of the judges amen God was using live ministry even in the time of judges it was a live judge there they were not playing what the previous judge was saying God was working through a live judge Jay men it was even though a woman judge now I don't want to go through you know get get get into that we know what the word says about that but God used a woman in that day amen so there was God is always working through live ministry amen praise God from one prophet to another but all under the same law of Moses and of course we know that there are transitions that are taking place under this message of the hour as well amen now we know we know that brother Branham he's a type of Moses that brought the word to us amen but it's very interesting that they pull up Malachi for chapter 4 look what look what verse 4 says remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him and horror for all Israel with the statutes and judgments and then verse 5 says behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord it almost seems like that that verse four doesn't fit in there but God has a purpose of letting us know a man that that prophet that Elijah amen that brother Branham types that was in our day he was also type in Moses as well amen so we're not forgetting what Moses said amen we're not forgetting I must say but we also want to hear what Elijah had to say as well amen praise God hey man so a man Moses ministry bringing the word to the people was a type of Elijah for our last days amen and just as Moses he brought the people out of Egypt and restored God's covenant to the people which was first given to Abraham and we've been we started a whole series downstairs for sunday-school about the circumcision of the heart amen brother Branham he also called us out of denominations and in the world and restored the Word of God back to us amen and just as Moses he had a cloudy day men brother Branham had a cloud as well amen Moses had signs in his life Amen that God gave him brother Branham had signs in his life that God gave them so you see the similarities are there amen brother Branham type Moses very very very perfectly but of course you know human nature does not like change we don't like change oh we just have so comfortable where I'm at Oh Moses I don't want to move on I like Kadish Barnea do we need to continue the 10 spies go over and see that the land was was was was good and it was flowing with milk and honey and that come they come back with a bunch of grapes and they're coming back and they're eating and and and juice is running out in their mouth and that lad is good and but the people were like are you sure are you sure yes good this was nice and juicy but I don't think we can take it though but you know there's only two there were willing to go who were confessing amen what they believed in what God had told them amen was Joshua and Caleb you say we're more than able to take that land they meant we're more than able to conquer it so the people and because the the ten spies they went in they back some good news but then they gave the people unbelief the people were like ok well I guess we can't take it I guess we can't take it just like in our day amen a bunch of unbelief amen taking place in this hour oh we can't move we we can't we can't accept what God is doing in this hard day amen we need to put birth ban back in the pulpit and we can't listen to the fivefold ministry we don't we don't that we don't oh well I guess we'll just die here you know go ahead and turn on my tape and drink my lemonade while I'm saying it you know in the comfort of my own home Amen when you need to be out you need to be a church a man listening to the word amen praise God amen so people under Moses Amen did not want to make that transition of change amen look what brother Branham says here in the message this great warrior Joshua here come Joshua back and Caleb and said the land is real here's the evidence praise be to God here's the evidence that God's promise is true we have the evidence here to prove it they said well the other said you can't do it you can't do it you get too much fanaticism mixed into it we just can't over you know and that was their opinion that's how it was what we have today is people's opinion why don't you go to church and then they just give you an opinion why don't you uh what do you think that you why don't you listen to the fivefold ministry and they just give you some opinion is there opinion not only they don't give you anything scriptural because they don't know the word they don't they just give you an opinion I don't want opinions I want the word amen and I'm I'm getting the word through the powerful ministry I'm not getting it through you amens so I'm gonna go back through the fivefold ministry amen praise God they said well the other said you can't do it you can't do you get too much fanaticism mixed into it we just can't go over if you do we're just going to break up all of our congregations we're going to do this my if that ain't the same old wine today that's right Oh it'll never work I tell you can't make it work oh we can't make it work but he who said it would work is able to make it work because it would it was going to be God through them amen if he can ever get people enough under his control get so submitted to him that he can do it I'll say that God will do it we we got the evidence today that Jesus Christ the Son of God raised from the dead and is the same yesterday today and forever and we're headed towards the Millennium hallelujah how I praise Him we're going to we're going in one of these days the captain of the host of the Lord is coming the Lord Jesus Christ will take us over amen praise God now it's the Lord Jesus Christ in you right now praise God through the Holy Spirit amen we know the Lord Jesus hey man he won't step foot here physically amen until later you know so there we see that these God is in transition mode all the time and we know also here there's where we've just been speaking about that there was also a transition from Moses to Joshua now Joshua he was the voice for our day I mean for that for that for that day amen for that day and no longer was it Moses Amen now look what brother Branham says here and the voice of the sign 1964 he says and what does and what does that do then I believe brother Bob sent this to me and it was really really good one amen so I give him give him the credit for finding this name what does that do then there has to be human flesh on earth to speak his voice amen there has to be human flesh to speak his voice I am the vine you are the branches that's Jesus speaking amen there is no way of getting around it friends it's just Scripture it's the truth and then he says you ministers believe that back there and of course the minister say Amen yeah man the true call Minister believes that a man praise God so Joshua he was the voice for that day the voice before that was Moses but Moses was already dead that voice couldn't continue anymore it was it that the law that he brought which wasn't even really Moses's word it was God's Word that Moses penned down a man on the tablets the ten the Ten Commandments and other other other laws that was all God's Word that they were carrying amen but now there was another voice that has stepped on the scene amen that was not forgetting what the law of Moses said but was not also forgetting or failing to hear what God else wanted to say as well in that day because let me tell you there were some things in the law of Moses or in the transition for them to cross in over the promise to the promised land they were not written anywhere in the law that God told them right there on the spot for them to do and the Joshua was not willing to hear the voice of God and the people were not willing to obey the fivefold ministry of that day they were not going to be able to cross over amen so Joshua he had to take what Moses said and what God was currently telling him to do and put a balance on both messages in order to help the people reach their inheritance this is all about balance tanks it's not one thing over the other I'll take the tapes over the fivefold minister or the fivefold ministry over the tape no I'll take both of them amen and I move on with God amen praise God I take both of them amen praise the Lord so the children of Israel had to possess the land and if not then everything that Moses had said was was was for naught Moses had already given them the land Moses had already told them you are going to possess the land everything all the miracles the crossing of the Red Sea everything that they went through amen back in the in the Exodus was for naught then when it came time when Joshua to lead if they were not going to take the land all that was was was for now so everything the message of of our day everything that God did amen was the cloud the pillar fire being photographed the miracle state that took place in the life of brother Branham and all these things they're all for now if if that message is not for us to apply so that we can take over possess our land they meant those things are for naught if we are not to possess our land in this hour day but brother Branham had said that we are to possess that land they men so somebody's got to go and do it amen otherwise all those things that we talked about so beautiful the history of what of what God did back then was for naught then it's so good to to like I spoke with a sunday-school class a couple of months ago spiritual nostalgia we just love to reminisce on what God did back in the 60s and 50s or what God did through brother Brandon but I don't know what God's doing around my life I don't mind I don't know what my children are seeing that God is doing in my life but but look what brother Branham did here and this and this you know you the way he carried his Bible and the way he wore this certain belt buckle and all these things and we're just so so officiated with the physical fleshly things of the message and we don't know what the message says I want to know what the message says Amen I want to possess my land I don't know about you I want to possess my land in this out that's my land amen praise God and like I said earlier Satan is attacking the bride and those in both both ways up over lifting brother branham downgrading the fivefold ministry or vice versa downgrading brother Branham and up lifting too much the fivefold ministry in so much now you see in the in sitting that's what Satan loves to do he loves to create imbalances but God is a God of balance in South Africa right now there's a church currently over there where they think the pastor their big old church there they think the pastor and I'm not gonna name names but they think the pastor is Elohim and they usually I have videos where they're singing to him Elohim and and all these things you know and and he loves the praise and he loves the worship on my and I'm sure brother Dale has seen things like that throughout his throughout his the years that he's been in the message so you see that's just that's why I say Satanists lie I'm again Saints yeah I cannot be fooled by the Pentecostal out here or the Baptist of the Presbyterian but you can certainly be fooled by a message believer so-called if you don't know where you're standing under the name of this message that you and I love that's what Satan is doing in the sound praise God amen read let's read Joshua chapter 1 amen now we still have time there's God we're not gonna read the whole chapter we just want to go verse by verse and I want you to see here what God is what God is saying verse 1 it says now after the death of Moses after the death of Moses now death is death right he's gone he's not he's not living anymore right after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses sister saying amen so now God is speaking to Moses Minister amen praise the Lord but is that what the Bible says that's the voice now and it's not like like God Moses died and and God said Oh am i what am I gonna do I guess someone after you Joshua now you know no God was we knew the exact time that Joshua was gonna step up amen amen praise God but during the whole time Joshua was being prepared praise God amen now brother Branham he he said himself Moses represented the law but Joshua represented Grace and if you want to bring that up a paradox 1965 good time for the brothers to bring up this there you go it says now we find Joshua representing the grace representing grace or some propitiation that it could not exist in the same time that law was in existence right God doesn't give a message to two men on the same time Amen - amen praise God neither does any message that fords the people on ever coincide with a past message it will not do it that's where you have trouble today Jesus said does any person take a new piece of garment and put it into an old or put the new wine into old bottles they perish it bursts them open so the things that are being done in this hour in the name of this message amen they they're they're gonna perish they're not part of the original Word of God amen they're gonna burst and we're you know you just whatever it doesn't come from God whatever is not it originally from from him amen it will come to now just like all these doctrines that have been preached in the 60 70s and the 80s and all these things amen you're seeing that they're just kind of falling over away now where all these manna they're gone they're dead and gone most of them and so as these doctrines but Satan again is so sly amen he's raising those other things up in this hour they don't seem so so so bad like like like though things were back then amen but but if you're not careful a man you'd be derailed from what God is really doing in this hour neither there's any message that for does he are putting you on okay and Joshua could not at all be coming to his ministry until after Moses was gone so you see the very first verse here Moses my servant is dead now arise and take this people to the promised land Moses representing the law had served its time it's the law had served its time they started out really with grace to begin with before they had law they had grace while they were in Egypt without law no one down there was just the priest and so forth but they didn't let's just skip down to the last part here it says first it says so there was Joshua representing grace was right along with law but could not be enforced as long as law was in its proper place amen so the Holy Ghost amen in this hour through the fivefold ministry man could not do Amen what until after the message was brought forth in the way that it came amen brother Branham has already stepped off the scene amen God turned the corner amen but with the same message amen taking everything Amen that that message gave us amen now adding one thing to it I'm not taking one thing out of it amen but we want to see what God because remember brother Branham said what is the denomination is when you put a period on what go and you say I believe this and that's it and that's what a lot of people have done in this day I believe with the message that God sent period that the brother Branham preached period but they don't want to know anything else that Godhead is doing in this hour and God's doing lots of things in this hour and you should be spiritual enough to know oh because people use the message as a security blanket over them oh no I don't want to do anything else because I know this is right you know I don't want to get involved in anything else because I know the Prophet was right amen well then you're saying they meant that you don't know where you're standing in the word you don't you're not confident of the Holy Ghost that dwells in you amen to discern what's right and what's wrong out there amen but I believe the Holy Ghost God is more powerful than that hey man God has given us power amen to discern amen the right amen I can't be again I can't be deceived I've gone to a Catholic Church even in this message twice three times actually I think do you think I'd go in there and I'm gonna I'm afraid I'm gonna get deceived no I know where I'm standing praise God you should know where you're standing if you have the Holy Spirit dwelling in your life I know what the Prophet said and I know the best amen praise God but they use the message of kind of like a security blanket that they don't want to step out into anything else amen praise God BIRT verse two there in Joshua one Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel God had already given them the land all they had to do was go and possess it amen every place that the sole of your foot shall trade I'm trying to try to move move move quickly because I've got more content you only get to every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the wilderness and this Lebanon the skip down to verse 5 there shall not any man be able to stand before the old days of life as I was with Moses so I will be with deep I will not fail thee God was not gonna be with somebody that was dead God was telling Josh so I'm gonna be with you because you're alive and well and you're my voice for that for my day amen praise God be strong and of good courage verse 6 for unto these people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them amen and Joshua we know he's a type of the Holy Ghost brother branham said then i'll show you later on where he said it - he's a to divide the inheritance to the people which is a type of the Holy Ghost dividing himself amongst God's people they meant giving us our inheritance amen only be tough strong and very courageous that thou madest observed to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee now brother God was telling here to Joshua to do what the law of Moses amen he wasn't bringing Moses Amen himself - he was bringing the law that Moses Amen - remember the law amen we remember the message Amen we bring that with us and take whatever else God wants to have for us to have Amen praise God turn not from it to the right hand or to the left out that thou may is prosper whithersoever that was going they met and brother BAM says hearing the message abduction they men he says Moses being a top of Christ led the children up to the promised land then Moses did not take the children in the promised land Joshua took the people in and divided up the land Jesus paid the price led them up to the Holy Spirit God sent the Holy Spirit down and he positionally put the church in order each man filling him with his presence of his being amen praise God amen verse 8 of Joshua 1 this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayst observe to do according to all that is written therein we want to we want to do everything that brother Branham preached right for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success God amen we would just you know God's saying that that that's my word amen and my word takes preeminence over anything else even over the life of Moses my word takes preeminence over the things that Moses had done Amen this thing wasn't about Moses was about me the whole time praise God is what God is saying amen let's get down to verse 11 pass through the hosts and command the people saying prepare you victuals for within three days II shall pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it what if the people said I don't want to go in three days I think that's too short of a time are you just gonna stay back we're moving the Holy Ghost is moving amen praise God now let's let's go to Joshua chapter three amen and Joshua arose early in the morning and they removed from shittim and came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel lodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host they meant after three days being the number of perfection amen and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests and the Levites bearing it then shall ye ye shall remove from your place and go after it now we know that the Ark of the Covenant represents the word amen represent because that's where the word was stored amen in the Ark of the Covenant and the priests that were holding the cup the ark amen which the ministers of that day buried the word they were handling the word amen the priests were live men they were in dead man otherwise they'd be zombies carrying the Ark of the Covenant they were alive man upholding the law of Moses which was the Word of God in that Ark amen so the people's main focus God that God is telling Joshua to to tell the people to do was to look to that word but the word needed to be lifted before the people right it wasn't gonna lift on its own hey man it needed to be lifted by the priests amen and they they had been the people were able to look at the word the law of Moses the message of the hour that God Amen had given the Moses amen the people were able to look at that praise God amen because it was lifted by the Ministry of that day think about that sense if the Ministry of our day does not lift the word up before you're not gonna be able to see praise God it takes ministers amen to lift the the the Word of God the message of the hour for this day amen you know in the Philippines and in other countries that I've visited you know there's a lot of people you can give him the message books you can give them the the tapes and all that but if they don't have anybody to explain it to them they're not gonna understand the message there no they don't understand they need ministry a live man a man live person they can sit down and tell them this is what brother Branham said was saying here this is this as long as it's according to the word amen and we know what brother Branham taught was thus saith the Word of God and Men and the Word of God is God himself amen amen so verse four yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cubits by measure in other words there is a scarran be a space between the people and in the end the Ark of the Covenant come not near unto it that you may know the way by which you must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore Saints we have not passed this way that we're at before we don't know what the future holds we know what the word says about the future we know what brother Brown said about the future amen but we that's what we need to look to the word amen in this hour praise God so we have we we have to give the ministry space to do what they are called to do hey man praise God that space was there given Amen so that the people could see okay that's where the Word of God is going I'm gonna go it but if I if I get too close you know that then the ministry would probably stumble you know the minute the the priest would probably stumble something might take place God was telling this them this so that you can see clearly where that where that word is going amen therefore you need to leave that space amen praise God and look what Hebrews 13 we always quote Hebrews 13:8 right Christ Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever but people don't ever read what Hebrews 13:7 and verse nine say and look what it says remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the Word of God whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation now that word rule does not mean like they beat you upside the head and like like like a Hitler style type of ministry no no it's just those who have how can I say it those who have control or listening to the God to God in that day there's a certain word I'm looking for and I can't think of it amen a leadership yes the leadership that's a good wasn't the exact word but that that's exactly a man who have spoken unto you the Word of God whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines yeah and they certainly are out there today for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace remember Joshua type grace amen right not with meats not with the physical things of the message amen which have not profited them that have been occupied therein a man I was telling I was telling brother Dale this this past Sunday when I first come into the message in the church that I did ask that I kind of went to a few years how they preached was close line messages close line message constantly and I didn't I don't I didn't remember seeing one sister who was not dressed right you know they were all dressed seemed like they were dressed right you know look but they seem like that's all the pastor preached was clotheslined religion you know and and and and and and now the the pastor's wife is out wearing pants now and all kinds of stuff you know because why they're so stuck to the physical things and Paul here saying which for it is good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats physical things you know which have not profited them that have been occupied therein we want to hear the word Amen well those things are good we need to hear when oh if there's a sister or a brother who we're not dressing properly and sometimes the Holy Spirit needs to needs to say something about that amen through the ministry amen but if but there's other things in the word I want to hear amen and that's not all that the message is about cutting hair and all these things a man there's a lot more than that that I want to hear amen because I want to possess my land amen praise God brother Brown says here and the message called the guide God told him that he would send them a God he would lead them in the way as long as they followed that pillar of fire they was all right he led them up to the promised land gate and then that was as far as he was to go then Joshua that great warrior remember the day that he told him sanctify yourself the third day God's going to open up Jordan down here and we're going to cross now watch what he said I like this in the scripture he said stay close behind the ark for you have not passed this way before what was the Ark the word don't travel your denominational routes now stay right behind the word because you haven't been passed this way before and brother if there was ever a time that the Christian Church ought to examine itself is right now we're right now where this great meeting is going on in Rome right now differences are being made to come for a duration of churches where all these denominations and Confederated together to form the image of the Beast amen you know brother brown said this message can't be denominated amen but there's people that have certainly done that but the word can't be denominator they matter but there's their denominations a surfer certainly in this message they're headed straight to that system a manner they're not careful and here we are right everything right at the door and people still following after a Creed you better stay behind the word their word will lead you across because the word is Christ and Christ is God and God is the Holy Ghost stay behind the word oh yes sir stay with that guide stay right behind it don't get in front of it you stay behind it I believe I'm just gonna get in front of it you know I'm gonna do my own thing well you'reyou're you're not in God's program then amen let it lead you you don't lead it amen you let it go Joshua said now you've never passed this way before you know nothing about the road Amen verse five in Joshua chapter 3 here and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you a man so we need to clean up have our lives cleaned up and made to see God working in our day amen and in our life and Joshua spake unto the priest saying take up the Ark of the Covenant Passover before the people and they took up the Ark of the Covenant and went before the people they men which we know Joshua is a type of the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ amen it was not the one holding up the word Joshua was not the one holding up the word right Joshua was not the way it was the priests that were holding the word amen I remember Joshua is the type of the Holy Spirit why was he not their whole you know why was he as the leader the voice of that day he was not the one holding the word before the people it was the priest holding the word before the people amen again think about that for our day amen and the Lord said unto Joshua this day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses saw I will be with thee so as God magnified Moses amen so was God going to magnify Joshua before the people Joshua did not magnify himself amen brother Branham did not come here and to magnify himself God magnified brother Branham amen to the people they met a true God called Ministry of our ministry men doesn't magnify himself amen he may magnifies the God in him amen praise God praise the Lord amen uh-uh all right let's just skip down you can condition for the sake of time praise God I knew this was gonna happen now [Laughter] amen but how many have to work tomorrow brother Terrence your line just give me a few more minutes we might might go over but just give me a few minutes now Saints this is life Saints amen to me this is life and this is the battles that we have for our day you see the battles that they were fought through the Exodus through the times when Moses was alive doubles the battles for that timer which led to the battles that Joshua is is battling with the people for that time we have current battles right now that we must face and we can't just we can't just pity patter around there's oh just let them do whatever they want to do and just you know I'm I'm sorry I'm gonna speak against it that's what God tells me to do that's what I'm gonna do again not not not to the people but amen but against that spirit that's trying to come and and deceive you in this hour if you're not careful now in Joshua chapter four I want you to just look at this out you can read the whole chapter yourself but one thing that I want to take know amen Joshua chapter 4 they this was the during the time when they were crossing and after they had crossed the priests still in the water or not in the water because the Bible says that they crossed through dry ground they didn't cross through muddy ground it was dry right it was dry when they started completely dry and they cross right through that now thing now when they got to the other side before that God had told Joshua to pick out of the 12 tribes 12 men Amen and and it's interesting that you see that in chapter 3 and you don't know the purpose why that is now again that was not in the law of Moses for them to do that but God wanted that to be done in that time you see you don't saying that wasn't in the law of Moses 12 man to be picked out for but it was after they had crossed over to the other side that the purpose for those 12 men was to be it came came to life and it was for them to grab each one 12 stone each one a stone to take it from the bank or from that from the area and take it and to put it right there on the bank and to pile it on top of one another and God tells them the reason why I want you to do this is in order set so that the future generations that are coming after you you could tell your children that God had done the exact same thing that God did through Moses God did the same thing in our day amen because we stayed with the message for our our amen and you can see that if children if you stay with the message for your day God will be able to do the same things in your life amen praise God right so that's just that's the reason why God was was given that giving them that that that sign to put those 12 stones on top of one another to let them know to let the children know hey son let me tell you let me tell you what God did when they come in asks daddy why are those stones there son let me tell you what God did in my day you know let me tell you what God did in my day hey man and that's what a lot of people don't have that testimony for their children in this house or they could tell you what God did for brother Branham but it's okay to talk about what God did for Moses but the children the children want to know what God is doing in your life amen what did God do in your life because that will affect them and tell them oh my if I stay with this word if I do what mommy and daddy did then God will be able to work in my life in that way praise God so that's what I got out I got out of that amen praise God amen just kind of throw that in a many and if the children heed to that and are taught well and live it in the word for their day then God will perform the same miracles and signs in their lives and in their children's lives and so on and so on amen praise God that was something for us parents amen praise God now Joshua chapter five we're winding down here this is the meat and potatoes now praise God the others was kind of appetizers now let's get to Joshua chapter five now now we know that the land of Canaan a man represents the Christian life in the Holy Ghost does not represent the the millennium and it does not represent heaven you know like some denominations may say or some people may say it's life and the Holy Ghost why because they still had troubles and problems stripes sicknesses and things that were taking place in that time after they had even crossed over amen now Joshua chapter five verse one and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorite which were on the side of Jordan westward this is after the children of Israel had crossed over and all the kings of the Canaanites which were by the sea heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of Jordan again he dried up those waters and they were overflowing during that time what a miracle working God ain't name those banks a man there were overflowing waters and be from before the children of it until we were passed over that their heart melted the people around them were scared neither was their spirit in them anymore because of the children of Israel they knew that God was with them amen I wondered the world's can say the same thing about you and me hmm at that time verse two at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time oh we crossed over the Jordan where we made it glory be to God but God then comes down with a message to Joshua which was not in the it wasn't a message that wasn't in the law it was a message specifically for Joshua to tell the children of Israel right there in in and say no praise God I brought you through pray you die praise the Lord you're you're here but there's something else you must do amen there's something else you must do amen circumcise again the children of Israel the second time now as I was mentioning on Sunday School God gave Abraham the sign of circumcision in order to show to show that he was going to keep that covenant with Abraham that message that's that law or that that covenant moved on to Moses and God gave it to Moses as well in the the man for that hour and he was to keep that give it to the children of Israel he was to keep that as well and now here the next man in line the next messenger for this age he's asked to do the same thing again and we're gonna continue reading as to why amen the second time Amen Saints because let me tell you let me just read here what brother Brown says here in the message the results of decision notice now how they went on god looked down both smoldering sacrifices and God blessed Israel because he was with Israel here they come up now to the border line Moses had died and Joshua was the new leader and he was going to take the children across to the other side they sent some more spies out had to go spy the land out again forty years had passed that see you have to go you have to go do your first works over again amen don't you praise God amen and brotherwe brought this out to me and Sunday and I thought was really good the the brothers can can bring up that the stature of a perfect man kind of a bigger the bigger because I mean and while they're bringing that let me just continue reading this this thing that is cool I think if Pentecost started off back there with that kind of a freeing going of free hearted and the free in the spirit and everything I think you better go and do your first works over again don't you think so get back to the old hewing line the old landmark again come back again to believing in God come back to letting the Holy Ghost have its way in your heart to worshipping God in the spirit in doing like they used to a man praise God now to me and and in brother Joe he's mentioned this before you can kind of look at this almost kind of like a like a like a road you know you see what I'm saying if you lay it flat you know it kind of looks like a road you know but and just in type you know the children of Israel at Jordan Amen praise God now you receive the Holy Ghost amen and when you're born again at faith right praise God amen and it's the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit in you that produces these virtues they meant you keep producing yourself contrary to or a lot of people think you can't produce knowledge virtue of temperance basis all these things on your own that's not in you to do that you man you need the Holy Spirit to produce those things in your life amen praise God that's what you need the Holy Spirit down here amen praise God but then it comes so to me a man the Holy Spirit God gave them the law back in the Moses time amen circumcision they were circumcised they meant and later on in the same chapter they forgot about that they forgot about therefore that's why they were not practicing it anymore so they may have had the word of Moses a man they may have had circumcision at that time but that was not good for this hour that was not good for this hour because even at the cross a man because circumcision is a type of the Holy Spirit amen circumcise in your life amen even at the cross amen even at this at the headstone you're still gonna have fights you're still gonna have battles you're still gonna have problems in your life and the Holy Spirit you need to have the Holy Spirit amen and your life now the headstone amen he's that's Christ they may we know this message is the headstone they meant praise God but you believe this message I believe this message praise God but I'm still struggling I'm still battling Amen I'm still having trial of trials Amen I'm still having problems Amen but you need to continue moving on with Christ amen you need to continue moving on with Christ praise God in order to obtain your full redemption of your body amen praise God I hope that was kind of I hope you understand what I'm trying to say hey man hmm so circumcision represents cutting off the flesh by the Holy Ghost and remember Joshua represents grace Joshua is also a type of the Holy Ghost now brother Bram said that the great Joshua the Holy Ghost that received a promise from God that come down to lead us amen so he gives him he says he says here that he's the Holy Ghost amen praise God now remember and of course remember that Joshua is also a type of Jesus Christ amen Joshua and brother Graham says Joshua was a type of Jesus because Joshua means Jehovah Savior amen he was a type of Jesus praise God so we know that the Amen we know that this message is the capstone amen praise God but this message a man will with with this word a man will produce the body change amen if you stay with this word Amen praise God and and I believe I believe what the scripture says that you must how the scripture said being born again ready man praise God it's not just you're born again one time and you receive Christ one time and that's it Amen you must constantly die out to yourself amen praise God even at the cross amen praise God even that you but that's why God told him amen circumcise yourself again amen young people they men listen to me for just a moment just because you were born in this message just because God your mom and dad believed brother Branham said brother Branham is a prophet and and you've come to church all the days of your life every Sunday you have not missed every one's that you have not missed amen you must needs to be circumcised they get spiritually amen you have because all you've done is just gone through the motions and the children of Israel that had just crossed all he did they were just they were following the word but they were not circumcised they were not circumcised that's what the Bible says and they they were even and in the end the message so called on the other side already had crossed over into Jordan and they were not circumcised so there's a difference between being in the message and the message being in unity meant that's a difference praise God amen you need to have the Holy Spirit that was experienced with the Holy Spirit young people children listen to me you need to have an experience with Christ but for yourself you can't say oh brother Dale I'm going in cuz brother Dale you know preaches the word know they'll needs to have his own experience as well oh I'm going there because my mom and dad they go to church every single Sunday nope you're not going in because of that right you need to know what Christ amen you need to have the new birth for your own self young people children amen praise the Lord and this message is the headstone we know that and it's crying grace grace grace amen praise God when they got to that you know that is all grace Joshua representing grace amen hmm now again if none of this is sounding correct Dale I want to be corrected amen praise God but this is you know cuz I wanna I wanna I want to be right man praise God I'm not a type of minister that out you know you take it or take it or leave it you know I want to be corrected if I'm wrong you see what I'm saying I believe any God called ministry will have that desire a man praise God but even in the headstone a man you still had to fight a man to death right even in this message you still have to fight the devil praise God in this hour you still have to fight the devil amen this message is our land in the Holy Ghost but we still have physical fleshly problems they meant because why even when they crossed over Jericho was still needing to be conquered this Jericho needs still to be conquered right amen this Jericho still needs to fall this land still this this this this fleshly body needs to fall off amen in order for us to move on amen and obtain our full inheritance amen they crossed over whoa we crossed over we're here but God says circumcise the children of Israel again praise God praise the Lord think about that Saints Amen because the body change I mean remember circumcision represents the Holy Ghost circumcised Saints we all have things in our life that we're still have to battle with a man that don't say that you're holy in it you have angel wings you know because I know none of you I don't see an angel wings around you and I don't see halos all over your heads each and every one of us has struggles that we're still battling with they meant and we're in the message of the hour right so that means God's still doing the work and you and me God's still expecting amen God still wants to circumcise you for the second time in there praise God amen hallelu I believe that and so that body change will not be produced without the Holy Spirit amen you must have it for your own self and that's why we must see what the Holy Spirit is currently doing for our day amen follow what God is doing it in our day night now verse four and let's just read this this quickly verse four it says and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of the Egypt and with all due respect to great men a man they that came out out from under brother branham a man they passed and have gone on to obtain their reward Amen brother branham has passed and gone on matter of fact he did not even obtain a body change he's actually waiting for you and me that might sound strange to some people but that's the truth he's waiting for you and me to come to this full inheritance he came to adoption I believe that with all my heart he that he's dead and gone his message still lives on with all due respect to the Prophet but he's waiting for you and me to come to this position praise God he's waiting for you and I because that's what the scripture says has to happen first and it's not gonna be a private resurrection for brother Branham to come give us something that he hasn't already priest mm-hmm a lot of those people that are waiting for brother Branham to come again when brother if brother Branham comes again and starts preaching again like they think that's gonna happen I believe brother Branham was Bisbal gonna be resurrect and he could preach for 40 days or whatever that's fine I'll accept that that's no problem but I believe those people who believe that he'll come and put up a tent and all those things you know the way it's all involved that they think it's gonna happen brother Brennan will be the last person they'd want to see then good brother Branham will blast it brother BAM will blast them for not obeying and hearing the word that he had already given them I'd be the last person they'd want to see praise God verse 5 says now all the people that came out were circumsized out of Egypt but all the people that were born in the wilderness were born in the message you know so call by the way as they came forth out of Egypt then they had not circumcised and there was a commandment given to Abraham passed down to Moses that needed to be fulfilled it was God's Word where the children of Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness to all the people that were men of war which came out of Egypt were consumed because they observe obey not the voice of the Lord in our day the people have gone and gone by the grave a man they then obtain a man this the the full Redemption the body changed that we're we're so desiring and we're in the cusps of receiving amen they didn't come to that they're waiting for you and I to come to that amen praise God and then they can raise a name unto whom the Lord swear that he would not show them the land which the Lord swear unto their fathers that he would give us a land that flows with milk and honey and their children whom he raised up in their stead them Joshua circumcised for the four they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised him by the way amen so the people imagine God telling Joshua to four to do this for the second time and in the children of Israel they were what 20 25 years old maybe they were older they had to submit to that word and submit to Joshua the Holy Ghost in the hour amen to sit to say yes we submit to that circumcise us again the Holy Spirit circumcise again amen praise God that's the reason why Saints I want to I want to listen to what God is doing in our day and I want to obey what God is doing I want I want not forgetting what God has done but I want to hear also what God is doing and follow Amen because then I might miss that second circumcision and you might miss it and we don't want that because that was part of this process of this transition God was turning the corner that's what needed to happen amen mmm and it came to pass when they had done circumcised and all the people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole and the Lord said unto Joshua this day have out rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off of you wherefore the name of the place is called Gil gone to this day in Egypt where represents the world when you received the Holy Ghost no matter if you walked in this message all of your life but when you're really born again amen the world should start falling off of you amen it may not happen right there all at once but it'll start happening if there's been a new birth new a real new birth that has taken place in your life praise God you know when you're really born again you will not be bored at church you will love coming to church you know you will not young people you will not be bored and looking at your your watch and looking back and going to the bathroom every single 10 minutes you want to hear hear what God has to say if the new birth has really taken place in your life but if not you know then it's just another church service and that just doesn't go for the young people it goes for us adults as well we're just as antsy as they are praise God and I include myself in that too and the children of Israel and Campton Gilgal and kept the Passover after the circumcision they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even even at the plains of Jericho so when the Holy Ghost had circumsized has circumsized you it needs to feed off the lamb right that's what the Passover represented they fed off the lamb back in the in Exodus amen and they weren't feeding off an old Exodus Land no that's hey Dave it was something fresh man but they were feeding off a fresh Holy Ghost Land for that day amen and they day they eat up the old corner of the land on the morrow after the Passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the same same day hey man you're gonna start eating meat now amen you're not you're not crying Abba Father anymore you're gonna start eating meat praise God you're gonna start eating the the strong things of God amen in 1st Corinthians 3 Paul says here in verse 2 it says have I have fed you with milk and not with me talking to the Corinthians for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able for a year for ye are yet carnal and you still see that same carnality here even amongst our ranks for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions and you or not and are you not carnal and walkers man for while one saith I am appalled and another I am of apollos are you not carnal you know oh you know I stay with just the tapes only and you know know being carnal man Hebrews the five eleven says for everyone that youssef milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are full age so those who have been circumcised for the second time even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil amen and then the last part here in verse 13 of Joshua I appreciate the brothers back there they're just trying to keep up with me amen it says and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand amen that can't be none other than Christ himself amen because watch and Joshua went unto him and said unto Him art thou for us or for our adversaries amen and look everything that God had commanded Joshua for the people to do was done they were walking properly then God stepped on the scene same thing that happened when Moses when Abraham looked up one day and he had done what God had told him to do amen he saw the three men coming down amen God Himself visiting him amen and God stepped on the scene and blessed him amen and he in verse 14 and he said nay but as a captain of the host of Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and that person that he was worshiping didn't say don't worship me he was receiving that worship so it was God himself what saith my lord unto his servant verse 15 and the captive the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place where I'm destined this is holy in Joshua did so just like Moses at the burning bush they meant same thing was happening here amen amen and and and this event would not have taken place if both Joshua and the people were not subject and in full obedience to the word for that hour for that hour I just do the word of Moses but to the word for that and finish in here this quote brother Graham says but the believers adoption but the believers the Caleb and Joshua outfit that was going on to the promised they moved on over into the land and took the land and settled down in the land as a possession and we never stopped at justification sanctification let's go on to the baptism of the Holy Spirit let's not stop at believing on the Lord Jesus being baptized let's not stop because he cleaned us up from a life of sin but now we pressed on into a position to a promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and because Saints people feel like there's something that they have to do in this hour is still a Catholic mentality and the people amen like there's something that they have to do there's nothing that you can do amen just do the word amen obey the word and then they and you'll produce the word amen that's all you have to do amen oh you know I must need to travel to Indiana you know to to to listen to the word no you need to listen to the word amen the word if the word is being preached at a local church Amen listen to the word there may need to be brother brems not standing behind that pulpit there I'm gonna tell you that right now brother Brandon says here I'll finish with this one I promise in the message paradox now they were baptized repented and were baptized and come out to walk in a new life in a new land in a newness journey amongst new people in the hand of God upon them but it finally came to a place in this walk that they had that they was not satisfied with their walk of grace they had come they had to come to something that they could do themselves that's how the people of it the people of Israel got to they felt like you know this isn't enough I need to do something else you know and that's just Catholicism now that's where people think today of divine healing or so many other work of grace of God that that there is something that you have to do you you there is nothing you have to do but believe just believe God and they if they would have continued on the promise wasn't given them under the law the promise was given before the law without any conditions to it I have given you this land go on over into it but before they got to that promise they decided there was something they must do themselves and that we still find that among human beings we're prone to be that way there is something that we've got to do we feel that with that we've got to have something into it also God doesn't want you to mix yourself for your ideas with this word amen it wants you to leave your ideas and your interpretations out of it you do have something into it that's your surrender of your own will your own idea to the will and idea of Almighty God and it's finished that's all there is just take his promise don't think of nothing else walk by it and God does the rest of it amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so how many want to turn the corner as God's turn in the corners amen I want to follow amen I want to follow in this hour amen I don't want to get ahead of the word amen I want to follow what the word is doing amen I want to look up to it amen but respecting the ministry and what God is doing through men in our day as well amen because those are just as much God called man as brother Branham was a God called man we know that he had a position Amen that we can't we can't have that position but that position is not working here amongst us anymore he's gone he's left us a word we want to we want to see what that word says and obtained amen brother Branham caught he caught a glimpse of it but he didn't he saw what he what he wanted the people to reach but he didn't reach it himself that's our job man that's our job and he's waiting amen for you and me amen to get to that position not just him all the saints they have gone on before amen my mother-in-law's waiting for me amen brother brother of brother Marlo brother Richard is waiting for us amen brother Gary's waiting for us amen we're waiting he's what they're waiting for us to obtain that inheritance in our life amen so they can they man come up amen and we all go in a rapture together after that man is that the word amen praise God how many love the Lord this habit this year I stand to our feet amen let's have the musicians come up thank God thank you lord he's God if you need prayer if you need anything

way to ringing you by the minister's to touch you you can receive from God rod let's exercise our faith amen but it's okay if you want to come here and be more than glad to pray for you amen but you
