in January so remember that and get everything ready for those times all right if I miss anything you just helped me to remember my wife is real sick last night she couldn't sleep she's got a lot of problems with sinuses I guess I don't know they don't know but it's a you know congestion and things and she's having trouble with her stomach so remember that and just keep her in your prayers but she's not able to be here this morning okay any other announcements let's just turn to Matthew 24 is where we've been reading for a while okay father we thank you for this day and your grace and to us thank you for all things and we just pray that you would bless us and guide us now as we try to speak about you come on the scene and touch us all Lord touch these old throats and things these coffins and different things happening our wife sikdaar with her stomach and her head and problems and all just be with her and touch her and everything be all right remember all of the sick among us because you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we depend upon that have your way now as we read your word and talk about you we ask you to come on the scene and direct us in Jesus name Amen okay Matthew 24 begin reading at verse 15 we therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet stand in the Holy Place whoso reads let him understand now we're using this to show you what this is this is and then where we're at right so this is the mosque of Omar that was put into the place there of the temple you know alright and when you see that remember and let them understand okay we have to have that then that them which be in Judaea flee into the this is what Jesus told the disciples or the followers to get out because Titus was coming in to destroy Jerusalem and not a true Christian arenium was caught left in the city you know when Titus came in in AD 70 because they all took his word to him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of this house neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days either one have to flee into the Judean Hills which would have been snow by on during that period of time but pray that your flight be not in the winter nor neither on the Sabbath day because he'd be hard to travel it was hard for you to get up and down but then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world on to this time no not ever nor ever shall be except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened remember how we explained that we'll get back to it in a minute now that God's gonna was going to let it run out but now he decided he'd take off a few days and do it no that's that's not the situation that we're getting to all right then if any man shall say unto you lo here is Christ or dire believe it not for the earth shall arise false Christ's and false prophets now you know how you can translate the word and into the word even so then read it this away brother shall arise false Christ's even false prophets see so you're putting it to where you can give it a little better understanding and she'll show shake great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect now we've got to quote in here in a minute where the Prophet said frankly I'd get them tied up they had to cut it short alright behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert now we're coming down to look where we're at go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not for as the Lightning cometh out of the east and China's even into the west so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be for were so ever the carcass is dar will the eagle's be gathered together amen you may be seated to the Lord at his blessing to the word evening of the word now coming down and bringing it like I said reading the Bible to see the day that we're living and so playing that we can see right dar that Jesus was bringing it all the way down and telling them to get out of Jerusalem because Titus was coming when he told him about the mosque of Omar that that would be put in the place of the temple all right coming on down and then brought it down to our day to work who were that they would be false Christ and he didn't say Christ singular he uses Christ singular in the for one verse in the next is Christ which is plural Christ means The Anointed One right all right see then the Anointed One the that anointing on the people on the profits on their teachings on their doings would be the thing to word that when we're in the end time look at where it's at what's taking place all right bring it right on down to were that we are today of how the so-called believers of the message have done everything they can do to try to destroy the message in its effect in things by bringing forth and proclaiming they have the revelation the why would you move out and do it equate things that people are doing if you ain't gonna claim you got the revelation or what's going home I mean right I mean you have no reason to move if you don't think you got something to move with I don't think you do you're in charge so look at the hour that we're living is right down to the lice to that point of the Christ or false Christ now listen the anointing is Christ there is only one Christ now get this before we move into any part to think about it there's not there's just one Holy Ghost there's one Christ but he can anoint many and they become Christ's anointed ones all right that Christ then doesn't mean that you're right because you can be anointed every day your life as we read the prophets said on your spirit and still be lost all right now that's what we want to go back and pick up some things in a minute and try to bring it out and especially to the ones that haven't heard the services we don't want to leave you behind we've been talking about how that they would be in the last days false Christ's now the Christ is not false if it is Christ there's not a false anointed one you know what I mean there's a people that are false themselves that are anointed all right now Balaam Balaam was anointed baylin's prophesies is in the Bible all right they put it in there okay all right and that's he is the anointing in other words the same Holy Spirit that was on Moses or Elijah or any of the prophets that same Holy Spirit was on Balaam not no different Christ now forget that in your mind now and don't think there's a Christ for this group of people and a Christ for this group of people there's only one Christ only one anointed one that is anointed of God you say well these others are anointed of the devil well you believe what you want to about it but he ain't got too much to anoint with he can do a lot of trouble but I'd rather stay with the truth of following it the way it is that we're in the day when there's many many different ones coming forth in the land to describe and and say that they are the Christ they used to be a group down in Florida they're back a few years ago that that they went for about six months in a row constant revival and they were Baptist constants six months revival you know who they thought they were the spirit of Elijah you remember that that's been about 14 years ago something like that it's been what back a good bit they thought they were the spirit of Elijah well see they found somebody found out in the word read it and they got into it and claim it through their own all right but see false Christ the Christ is not false All Right see what Balaam done now remember the way that we've tried to bring it out Balaam Balak tried to get Balaam to curse Israel right all right Balaam said I will go with you but I'll only say what God tells me why because that prophet he was a prophet in Israel counted with the prophets he prophesied like I said it's written in the Bible what he had to say all right then that anointing that his on him there's no difference in that anointing than what was on Moses old Moses was the Christ and who's he over or he's Antichrist well Moses spoke and it was putting the Bible right Balaam spoke is put in the Bible and as far as what they were doing what they were saying was in the Word of God Balaam was speaking it would put into the Bible and just like brother Brown said about koffice the prease remember cough was prophesied it was necessary that one died for the sins of the people see him being High Priest the anointing came on him and he prophesied that and it was a fulfillment of the scriptures but yet he was false yet he turned around and and had Jesus crucified but the anointing that was on him was genuine so don't get confused about that and say well I don't understand this and on this get simply what's taking place there's only one true anointing one Christ all right now then in that there's one Holy Ghost one Spirit of God that can come and dwell on people and anoint them all right see then we get to that and we we consider the hour and the day that we're living to see where we're at about these and like I said you see many now going across the claiming to be The Anointed One oh I've got the message I'm so it shows this brother Branham was wrong here we've got this we've got that we've got he was over here I don't care what yourself I've told you that over no I may be dumb and stupid as can be I don't argue with you about that but this message has brought me to Jesus Christ so then I know the message is not wrong now the messenger the messenger had mistakes he made mistakes he said things that were wrong he taught things that were wrong right but that don't make the message wrong well if he's wrong here he's wrong and I'll that's where people do it a brother that came by here one time a young man starting in the ministry and he came and I let him come and preach forests and and boy he was really on fire for the word you knowing everything but then he read one day brother Ron said if you catch me wrong on one thing said I'm wrong on every well now ain't a man in this world can say that with a sensible answer the Lord Jesus Christ is the only one that would be to the basis that he would never say anything that was wrong the Prophet wasn't saying that he was not wrong in sections as that he was saying the message was right take the message he said see because that's what it's supposed to be all right see then that's what we're supposed to be in this hour - just to see what's taking place in the day that we're living all right now what about it's just genuine now let's get just let's read a few things and you know you say well I don't like to hear the Prophet read well then let's get up and go home okay turn it off that's no problem I'm me yeah but you see I was doing this way back and all these doctrines I've tried to get people to see that and they don't do it these doctrines that are floating around now saying brother Brennan was wrong we were facing this back in 1970 we had ministers meetings over these things in nineteen and seventy and I told them then just what I'm telling you I don't care what you say about brother Branham that's between you and God you better remember one time if he was a prophet that's their choice not me now if he was a prophet remember if you kill a man's influence you killed the man yeah but we're not against brother Branham we're gonna we're gonna keep brother Branham around and quote if you say one thing that he's wrong home you better be willing to put it in the word and see because if not you're gonna face God that's simple as I couldn't think where were you at that's where I stood for 40 50 years now and I don't have to change it because see I haven't found anything that was wrong they had done in church age book years ago remember they had 17 things that was wrong I put it out here put it on the Internet put it online oh they sent out these letters ago I said send it to me come to me and let's talk about it that's not challenge you on that basis the church age book is right you come and show me where it's wrong don't come was I'm a little silly something like we were talking about it life's not how are you gonna do if you're in the word and you say well well we're in the word with you've got four Gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John Waite was talking like this like not Luke and who is it mark they were not original right John and Matthew was original now if I got them right didn't make sure if you don't put the name in the right place oh don't be stupid about it all right see two of those were not even original disciples they never walked with the Lord Jesus but yet Luke says I love him for that he says read it right in the beginning in Luke he said having perfect understanding huh well yet like wait were saying see Luke said one blind man and Jonathan said to well what is that I mean you're gonna declare that that's the Bible that's wrong I'm gonna declare the Word of God written by mankind that one saw two men and wrote of it and one this wrote of one man that simple I tell you that nothing the Baptist Church we didn't have no arguments over that yeah what's that's what I'm getting at see we want to make it because somebody comes along and especially had some kind of a little following and have some kind of anointing you know going and boy that is flock to it this run I threw it they run a while then that floats off and then they come back and then they wait a while they take off like for something else well we don't do that here we try to do one thing just keep on staying with the word I found out it works yeah I found out it works it's just and and it puts you toward that brother all thinking remember he said the other day that men Wade was just kind of little arrogant there what that were do you agree with I'm arrogant I'm proud I'm proud of the Word of God I'm proud of what God has revealed to me aren't you what are you arrogant no I'm not err I got well what's the difference in Harrogate and being stupid there's very little difference in the word all right see but I when I say things like that people don't like me but that's this way I've always been I've always believed if there is a God if he if he can't keep his words straight then he's not God and God said he sent us a prophet you can't go in there and try to define this and define that you leave it alone and wait on God to make it revealed or benefit don't worry about it we'll be a long coat advised in its time okay now get on to that point think about it so what we've been talking about now the anointing there's just one Christ now the devil was anointed he was the anointed cherub but remember he was the anointed cherub so somebody else had to anoint him oh that's sensible if he was anointed Europe he wouldn't God all right see then he got his anointing from God Satan had his permission or have his permission to use certain things against you and I the God allows to take place and what I love is that where we come back in Deuteronomy where he said you know I sent this among you to try you so if a prophet comes and gives you a sign but sister evil to go for after another God or another doctrine or another idea you're not to do that you just stay with the word and let that word be fully made manifest but see one genuine Christ not many know there's many Christ in the basis that are many are anointed but there's only one Christ one faith one Lord one baptism right there's not many gods but if you're gonna have many Christ you gotta have many gods but if you have one Christ even have one God but he can anoint everybody in the world that's no problem because see where that are going didn't go that's what we want to deal with today where that anointing goes and what it does all right now it's a very valuable point than we will recover as we go down that in the Old Testament before Calvary all right you had many that were anointed but there's not one born-again believer in the Old Testament now you show me where it's at I know I know where's now they're saying that that the Twelve Apostles well they've really got that in them from the Church of Christ and because the church Christ says only twelve had it now they're saying the twelve the Twelve Apostles said they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost before Jesus Christ died now tell me how tell me how according to Hebrews now I got these LAN here if you want them according to Hebrews they can't have the testator the Testament without the death of the testator all right see so there was no way if you could be born again before Calvary why did Jesus Christ died he died in vain I knew that in the Baptist Church come on where we act oh you don't like those things yeah you were smart aleck there was one thing about it I never consider myself to be smart but I guess I'll take the point of being an etic I need never fear doubt what that is yet somebody tell me what an elegy is now probably say ask me all right cuz you see I believed it back then we tall things we taught the scriptures I'll get to in a few minutes where that Jesus the Holy Ghost had not been given because Jesus had not been crucified or glorified that was the Bible we read that in the Baptist Church and believes you couldn't be born again until the day of Pentecost why would Jesus Christ have to come you making him die in vain if he could give eternal life yeah but they had eternal of it they were potentially potentially potentially because it had to go through processes to come on down all right so now think about it let's think about that Old Testament person let's think about how that he was in his situation that existed in and then you'll see that it's easy to understand all right we believe Moses right we believe brother Branham said Moses telling God a better way of doing something that was the Christ that was in Moses amen but who was invited when Balaam told Bailey I cannot say nothing that God don't tell me to say it and he didn't what he wound up doing was getting Israeli people over there with him more about women he got it all messed up then he got God to curse Israel cause he couldn't do it himself but when he found out he seen it from the scene wonder he knew that all they had to do was just get them people in the wrong place and God would come on the scene cuz he couldn't do it what about a false prophet standing there now and said I can't do it but you know what he wasn't a false prophet until he come in the face of the prophet he was a prophet of God with his bot with his spirit whatever numbers what did I give you numbers 14 or 24 whatever if I gave it the other day where he has prophecies in the Word of God all right see when we want to look at him as lost and gone in forever when God looked down they wouldn't but one thing to separate Moses and Balaam it was not the anointing they both had it what wasn't it separated the word Moses had the word Balaam had part of it right because his parties in the word but he couldn't stand before that one that was the real word right come on even Janice and jamberries could throw their snakes down and they would turn I'm into sticks down and they turn into snakes like I said I want to go Caiaphas the high priests because of being there that anointing of that high priest would come on him and he would prophesy the Yeti turned around had Jesus killed but the anointing was right there was nothing wrong with the anointing that was on Balaam it was his teaching come on you're supposed to read it you know the anointed ones in time you're supposed to read there I've got plenty of that layin here but you're supposed to read it you're supposed to know these things if you'll read it you'll hear the Prophet saying well why don't you do that and then you don't have to argue what I don't know we're brothers nails right or not we'll read the book right read the book then come and tell me I'm wrong but remember bring the book right make sure you bring the book so we're gonna talk about opinions you know we're gonna talk about the word all right now they said to brother Branham a genuine one Christ go to number three we'll pick this up what were they Christ sees are isds anointed christ and false prophets anointed ones but false prophets and listen to it jesus said that the rain falls on the just and the unjust so now that right there is enough to decide that the same Holy Ghost that was on Balaam was the same Holy Ghost that was on Moses because the rain falls on the just and the unjust do you understand that so that solves any problem you know well I don't know where Moses got Moses got this but Balaam got that come on get off of it you're trying to make up some kind of a story take the Word of God and see what it says now someone might say to me do you believe that that anointing on those people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine Holy Spirit of God upon a person and yet they are false it solves a problem now come we're gonna read them down here and he said that's done saith the Lord of course now here we are let's be good of course if you don't believe brother branham in the prophet and the message and all I got then him send us that the Lord don't mean a thing right but it does to me because to see I happened to read and I remember reading one day that brother Branham was talking about Balaam and he said to be a prophet in Israel meant a lot Balaam was honored as a prophet and he never turned false until he faced the word he still had the anointing he could still bring flies fleas and frogs if he needed to right because he was anointed right he could call she bears down like Elijah did brother around said that was not the Holy Ghost but he said it was the nature of the Prophet but it worked they told brother branham's to tell us where that all wells at and said we'll put it all into work of the Lord he said I knew they wouldn't do it he said I wouldn't tell him he said somebody else come along and sucked down hit a gusher the thing about it was he just knew but here's my point okay like something like that if brother Branham could tell you we're all well was he at least had some contacted I don't have what about you may I say it back and look at you he had some contact you don't have does that offend you okay no problem forget it but is it true beylin could stand and do those times Janice and Jam breeze done everything Moses don't accept one thing the one thing that was worth holding and it goes to the word what was the one thing holding from with Jennison Jam breeze you'll see it tide of the word they couldn't take back what they brought go read your Bible Genesis and jammers couldn't take back what they brought but they could bring it you saw either cheap magician you do it you got the platform I ain't gonna call snakes come on but I ain't stupid either I know you ain't go do it so I got to worry about come on if we get up into the realm of the supernatural why don't we thank supernatural you mean to tell me that there's a god that can no ever fly ever NAT every time it passes hi everything that it does before the world ever begun and we peanut-brained bunch of idiots say well God was wrong died her cuz that's what you're saying when you say the Prophet what's wrong come on that's what you're saying if you send the prophets from because the brother branham said a prophet stands before no one he goes directly to God he has no limitations of human elements that's why Balaam could not say anything that God didn't tell him even Balaam if we don't think like that come on listen close now see what it is and they show show signs and wonders and so much that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible and they are anointed with the a genuine holy spirit I know this sounds very foolish but you're going to take but we're going to take time and explain it by the word that that's absolutely thus saith the Lord yeah you're not dealing with something that it's just somebody's idea or thought you're dealing with us saith the Lord now this is what I like cuz I've tried to get this point across and I'll keep bringing it up I probably bring it up again okay go ahead to number see number four excuse me still only noted ones the teachings of Balaam not two prophecies available that was all right that was God oh I mean he believes that and he believes that was God don't raise your hand congregation says Amen prophecy of Balaam was exactly right because he couldn't speak nothing else the anointing of God wouldn't speak nothing else and God vindicated it by proving it by the truth proving it was the truth but it was the teachings of Balaam and compare that with Matthew 24:24 anointed ones but their teaching is false the Trinity's and all these things like that wrong Antichrist now I like this one I hope you don't your feelings don't get hurt and don't turn that them phones off in other words I do with you we don't hit the button in the earthís I got two hearing aids and all like I do what's going into this cut the whole thing off don't do do that I hope your feelings don't get hurt and don't turn that them phones off and don't get up and go out just sit still and listen if the Holy Spirit won't reveal it to us and prove it to us you say but that just whatever you believe in other words you're saying it's just whatever just sit still and listen ask God to open your heart that's God open your heart then you'll find out whether you're a Brower you know sticky briar every how you pronounce that I'll get my words I'm southern all right thistle or wherever you're standing now think about it ask God to open your heart so that you can find out whether you're born again or not I know anointed ones yeah but I believe I love the work come on it's in the anointed ones I've got it in here if I don't read it you go ahead and read it when you get on brother branham's said you say does them anointed ones believe in the baptism when the Holy Ghost he said yes sir they believe in signs and wonders they believe in all kind of things okay so you know we might find out whether we're born-again or not by considering what the prophet has taught us about anointed ones now when did he teach anointed ones I know there's little lay ins back through the message I've read it all not everything but I've studied it pretty well but when did the message come out unwanted ones after the opening of the seals okay let's see if that's right go ahead to number five still from a noted ones seeing all this accumulation of evidence that the hour that we now live in I think it's a good thing to rehearse these things and draw them out since the seals has been opened and find out the truth of these things as God has been so loyal to us with His grace to show us these things what is it after the opening of the seals he said well he knew about this he knew it that's what I said there's a little things put in there come on we're not arguing we're talking about truth after the opening of the seals these things came forth but Ron said marriage and divorce was revealing a seagull right he said the rapture was revealing two seals he said predestination was reading the illness it he said everything was revealed two seals right so then what did we have need of not to bring us the message of anointed but to bring us the message of the opening of the world that we would find out where we are well you offend me because you're you're saying I'm not born again ain't never told nobody that they wasn't born again I'll say this and be honest with it I won't call his name but there was a brother went to church here years ago and he left here and he went somewhere else and he said the reason he left was because brother Dale said he didn't have the new birth now he lied I didn't say that so I went straight to his face and told him I said you know what I say I said you don't act like you're acting with the new birth I didn't say he wasn't born again I put it plain language you don't act like you're acting and say you have the new birth right tell me the whole truth look in the last days there she'll write false anointed ones now that seems almost impossible they the terms of anointed but notice the very words anointed huh after the opening of the seals we didn't have understanding back before them but now we have the understanding from the opening of the seals but if the seal that broke to you and that's what people who say the seals that broke to me well okay then to seal that broke to you you can't understand an order one you don't understand marriage and divorce you don't understand predestination you don't understand any of those things if the seals are not broke to you because the Prophet brought us to see that was what his message was to do was to bring the end to our plan of redemption called seven seals now listen I want to get this point in come on see then in the Old Testament of course I know people say that's what I said it's already out in the message now that they're saying that what or one man done uncalled his entire view only two but if it's all right he said them Twelve Apostles had the Holy Ghost before Jesus was crucified now challenge that on the basis of God's Word let alone what the prophet has said and we'll just take the Bible we won't even study won't even say what the prophet had to say though we know what he said if he taught one Christ you know what he said all right so now listen to what he says what if say it that same anointing okay alright now let's get something to put in here or we'll just have a little bit we'll jump about a little bit now they have these okay brothers if you can bring up 7b its what shall I do with Jesus called Christ says but in Matthew the twenty-fourth chapter beginning with the 21st to the 26th verse he predicted that the spirit in this system would be so much like the real thing it would deceive the very elect if it was possible the elected whose names are put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and frankly it got them so tied up until he said if he didn't cut the work short for their sake there would be no flesh saved upon the earth now I didn't say that the Prophet is one it said it he said I can't be deceived I Malak I agree with you I agree with no problem the elect candidates a factory with you 1,000% but you can be so caught up with the devil in his doings until you were just listening before we came in today of the Prophet and he was explaining that the wife of Adam went into sin then he explained the wife of Jehovah went into sin then he explained the wife at Nicaea went into sin oh I've seen preachers jump up and down the screaming halt and try to run on everything in the world but it's still done it brother run said that bride never went down there than hacia oh it wasn't the real bride that brother Branham said the real bride all right if you argue with him I ain't arguing with you I'm stating what he said what did it need to argue about the other side the true bride went to Nicaea to try to convert them and come back with ideas that took 300 years the devout because there was some guy was down there you know the thing and they had Jesus as a demon God that's a Nazi in Council 325 AD but listen jerks I'm trying to get you to think sensibly are you born again or not well I've done this I've done that the Old Testament science let's just stand the Old Testament look at the things in the Old Testament three Hebrew children throwed the fiery furnace Daniel told the lines then David killin fire line John you gotta admit they were anointed right but yet they were not born again well I think they would well all right tell me where you get yourself from cuz it was a statement I asked you a minute ago it solves the whole problem without saying anything yeah if you were born again before Calvary then Jesus Christ in out to die that's why people don't understand the new birth then they get all upset when you start talking to them about it because they think is you're trying to destroy their new birth come on can we read I gave them this they might not be able to pull it up modern events made clear by prophecy brothers a couple of late on the desk I want to go I'm gonna give you one that'll choke you the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in not at all not on that don't have anything to do with your soul that's the baptism see here's the inside soul and here that has to come from God remember in that spirit you can be baptized the genuine spirit of God and still be lost have I become your enemy because I found the truth and read it to you to try to save your soul but you've got all your dependence upon something you've done or didn't do or this is that good instead of the one thing you can put it on they have a one thing you can put your new birth on that's whether or not that word has been revealed to you anything else that devil can copycat every one of them I believe the word so far I don't know okay let's go another funny leadership come on remember in that spirit you'll be by leadership see many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven can I be just straight honest forgive me Lord for using words that are wrong these stupid idiots that claim brother Branham was wrong here in wrong gar why don't they go in something like that and talk about it then go go in there cuz they don't know what he's saying they've blinded out to what he's saying if I was gonna prove retros wrong I'd take him right there but I got that sense of no he wasn't wrong doesn't know he wasn't wrong when he said you can be born again and then be baptized into the body hey man just get it in the right place come on what do you say you say I got the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost ever hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so that's exactly right now do you believe that do you believe it after he said it well I felt ready to know see if you're doubting it can you put your whole life on that statement wait a minute brother Dale cause he asked me put my whole life on it because I put my whole life back that one time that brother Branham was my horse rider he talked why horse rider for 20 30 years wrong a man he did and clerk Larkin even taught it before brother Branham come along at the white horse rider was the antique rock but that didn't make no change in the corners Larkin wouldn't profit he's my lucky guess he had two choices we took one another come on what are you saying brother Dale I'm saying one time do we believe the Bible and do we believe it's right and there's not to be questioned yeah what'd you say but he did and we all agree been around him for what 30 40 years I know up to the church age book coat it up into there when he gets into the one of the life's names coming on though we'll get to some other things in a minute why don't people get into that to show brother Branham was wrong ain't got enough sense pardon my playing Georgia language that's exactly what I mean and what I say because it's very simple you remember the dream about the pyramid Mountain right you remember the bar that was whipped to top off and looked down in there and saw things and brother branham what did he say he said light had never shined on this lot had never shined on the white horse rider as being the Antichrist so it could be your guess or thoughts until it was brought out but once it was brought out in the sealed that he ended it forever is this very simple him well I don't agree well come on you explain that you explain how that brother branham could be the Prophet and I want you to explain this before you get up here so you'll know better to get up here so you start this away to say what you're gonna say just remember one time I'll show you were in the same message that brother Branham said the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost he will say if I am right let God come on the scene and vindicate and he came on the scene and vindicated it now did God vindicate life no lot had never shined there was no responsibility that white horse rider was a sealed saint there was no no way anybody could bring that out until the seals broke through the Prophet oh you think about that first day when he seen that he said I was fixing to preach on the things that I had preached before and he said I would have been wrong he said in the Holy Spirit coming straighten me out what about it you see we follow a message that the message is infallible the person wasn't infallible he was a human element right with the message we follow but it had to be put into a place to be infallible I like the way brother all tick was bringing out sometimes you remember if until you're responsible to put in my words okay until that will come forth and those seals opened up nobody was responsible brother Brennan said you say what I say because I am responsible right now what did why did he say that I mean was we going to deliver to go out and lie about something or preach something wrong or do something no he just knew some things was not exactly settled because he knew Malachi four had not come because remember spoken word original seed 1962 which was prior to this opening of the seals he said Malachi 4 is not fulfilled yet that's on spoken words original seed the until the prophet brought lightly I stayed another one he's deep joking I was listening to tape one day and I thought oh honey back and listen but I run said the Baptist just to become a denomination that's long in about 60 I felt oh god what's wrong here the Baptist was a denomination of 200 years for the inn or something they had never rejected his message when they rejected his message they become a denomination every one of them denominations stood before that prophet I don't care what their dates was they stood before him because when he brought that word pure and unadulterated that's what he said he said we've done this and they've done that he said it's been brought peering under adultery he brought it right this message is 1000% correct show me one flaw in it other than some mistake you make her adulterer or something you say just missing a while I got it in here to brain I won't get to it today I'll get it's evening brother branham from the time he started up until 16 almost opening of the seals he told body so spirit named him gave there what happened after the opening of the seals he's talked body spirit and soul you say but he never correct that he didn't have to because he was right he said happy to be right over here right over that that's what I older let's leave it with you in order to go home and say forget it you're so smart about it now tell me what you see he never changed the census of any of those three places in his early ministry he always gave you body five senses always gave the second room no matter what he called it five senses memory reason conservation he always gave the sinner realm one sense either faith or doubt that's that identically what he'd done after the opening of the seals they didn't matter he just changed the wording caused our Hebrews 4:12 and he knows what he bruised 4:12 says that the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the dividing between the soul and the spirit and joining tomorrow the church that's where we've we've waited for it wait why the message has been brought to us why can't we just hold on long without to get it like I was saying a minute ago to the point to where it would be a short word these original translation when it comes to math you go ahead and number or 7b okay we don't got that Franklin over 7c where he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth a short work that means he was intending I mean human thinking he wasn't intending to let it go out of another thousand years but he decided to cut it off is that what it's saying that's that's the point that he he was going out but he decided enough that's not the scripture is the scripture because of short work with the Lord make upon the earth go to the next one seven be the definition of the word work he shall do a short word look at it word say in account speech a word uttered by living embodiment of conception that things that long if you want to keep reading it just check it out it doesn't mean a short work like he was gonna let it run out so long but he cuts it short an infinite God knows every second and everything what's going to take place in right to the T but it's a short word word he's going to pour the word in fiest in the life days I've said that since I come in the message I could see it on that because that was the meaning it's the opening of the word cuz the words the only way you'll know right around him I got him in here how you gonna know whether you're whether these are known in wonder whether you know he said it's only by the word of the day of the hour could you tell me anything that you say you know you're safe of showings oh I see how did I cry - smoking - everything Satan could impersonate it takes one thing you can't do can be so close but listen you can't be the Holy Ghost they can't do that and he can't bring it word by word so you see what they're doing in the last days they're picking apart the message and the little things of what the Prophet is saying trying to tear apart and get you to wear that you don't have confidence in the message now don't tell me I'm too old sorry don't tell me it don't bother you what is being done in this life days if it don't bother you you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost may I quote the Bible and the Prophet sighing and crying for the abominations done in the city is that the evidence of the Holy Ghost that's what your prophet said you mean it doesn't bother you things that are taking place they don't bother you we were up to get way to tell you we were up to Dylan though I've Hunton supposed to hunt another day we found out about the what happened with the brother and how that hadn't happened in what it took place where the phony was to minister that weekend for us I said go ahead go ahead I've got good I see you hon that's that's all right well well hard cuz we were gonna leave early the next morning to come back but we wouldn't have left you know hardly which we did leave early nothing we got here right at the end but I said go ahead he knew I was just pacing the floor work take it about those poor old people three or four hundred people in that church those brothers that had been within 30 40 years 50 someone probably and yet he comes out and denounced the message that broke my heart it broke my heart for brother Forney listen wait let's go home in the morning we were probably known this you know sleeping lighter coming home because we wouldn't go be him we was gonna stop by a church there in in Kentucky being the morning service so we don't never we don't go when we leave we go to church on Sunday I said just let's go home cuz out it just burden the heart I love that brother over there known him for 30 years or more little brother for near forty years probably it just broke my heart it don't break your heart about somebody falling you need the baptism when the Holy Ghost you need to get straight with God cause the sang and crying for the abomination done in the city and I ain't gonna say nothing these brothers we were talking the other day I told him I said I have nothing to say about anybody I'm not going to throw off on them and say they're lost I have nothing to say about these brothers that have went off the message except that pray that God will keep you and me from go because without him keeping us we will fall oh no I'm in the message okay's the message in you do you understand he's gonna do a short word he's gonna pour the word into the life stage and you look at it that's what's taking place but what did all this others doing okay just forgive me you say you said a moment ago let's just take the Bible all right in the Old Testament they could not have the new birth so let's read the Bible if they can pull these up go ahead and start and get hitting number eight Matthew 18:3 and said firstly I say unto you except you be converted and become as little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven now we're there converted come on Luke 22 32 what I have prayed for thee who is this Peter that I faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren what does converting mean they were not converted back there Nicodemus it comes to him and says you must be born again if he had to be born again there was something wrong with the way he's born to start with right and he couldn't have eternal life Nicodemus was the greatest teacher of all Israel jesus said in John 14:26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you the comforter what is the concert sir oh okay John 15:26 but when the comforter is come whom I will send on who you from the father even the Spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father and he shall testify of me the comforter who's the comforter but when the comforter John 15:26 well when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the father even the Spirit of Truth okay there's got to read Anila John 16:7 it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I was in him unto you what do you say it Jesus Christ had to come and be crucified and on the cross and go away before the Holy Ghost could come that's plain since come on I know you don't like it we taught this in a Baptist Church my Bible didn't change like most of people's did it was the same Bible I read John 16 and 7 number one we've done guy it's me view that I go no fun go not away the comforter won't come John 16:13 howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all things you speak Hebrews 9 16 for there where a testament is there must also necessity be the death of the testator where a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth is that plain of that oh but they want to get onto something like this then said Jesus unto them peace be unto you as my father sent me so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost well they say well brother Dale right the ire says it he breathed on them and and they reach now I didn't say they received come on whoever sins you remit they were emitted when he breathed on them and said to them receive you the whole to go brother branham what does that mean of course if he's not a prophet we don't need it sister of Tutsi versus sister Tutsi get up and tell us what this means she ain't gonna get up and say it cuz she ain't no woman preacher right she got no sense not to be one you understand what I'm getting at I'm trying to get her truth to where we can look at it brother branham okay 1964 were questions and answers dear brother branham what is the difference when Jesus breathed on the disciples and said receive you the Holy Ghost and when they when they had to go to the upper room to tarry it was a promise he gave them breathed upon them his promise said receive ye the Holy Ghost it was a promise they went to the upper room to wait for the promise to be fulfilled the same thing is when we lay hands upon you and you be healed then you go about your business waiting for the promise to be fulfilled see we've got the answer to people that come up with it and say well it says right here that he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost now what are you going to say okay go ahead John 7:37 in the last days that great day of the feast Jesus stood and saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this spake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified give you a Bible answer then now somebody comes along said this just pulling out and get to him in the Bible the Bible plainly tells you what it's saying right they could not get the Holy Ghost until Jesus Christ was crucified but yet we're so we're in the message we believe read a random talk this and so we're saying that they you know you get born again before well you just swap places with the Church of Christ because the Church of Christ said 12 couldn't get to Holy Ghost now you're saying they could so you just swap doctrines right you don't want me to say who that's wrong now look anointed ones anointed ones those Old Testament people could be anointed but they could only be anointed on their spirit because their soul was blackish sucked now you tell me how I could be made any other way their soul was black his suit they don't matter how good they was who they were born in what family or what this water that was don't have nothing to do with it their soul was black his such brother branham said David all he needed said he had the word you remember he said it I believe was David the songs would not word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee he said all he needed was the baptism with Holy Ghost then I've always said this away you just think about David kill a bear a giant a line in a giant without the Holy Ghost what would happen had he got it he just put them all together since bring your brothers right cause you claimed he had about four or five more brothers you know come on you understand he may I quote some things David would not have committed adultery had he had the new birth in her soul a lot of things can be said but I hope you get it those people in the Old Testament did not have no new birth they did not have eternal life but yet look at all the things that took place in their lives one man jumped down into a pit one day just killed the line just yes there's no problem to why because they knew they were anointed you remember my story about it David D David killed a lion in the bar huh but yet he winds up and he gets anointed Oh Samuel like I said he just said put them all together cause David knew you don't think about the anointing like this this is what I thought anointing I'll get to it one of these days of preaching anointing is not this better you know there's not sound and Wonder anointing is supreme power in control that's what your profit statement and there David was and all these things and David doing all the things he was doing but yet he had that anointing David knew samuel was a prophet there's how much he trusted do you trust this prophet as being the prophet of melech I for Luke 17 30 revelations himself do you put your whole life on it the David walked out there and faced everything that was in his way on one thing Samuel anointed me to be king of Israel he knew he could not die be killed run over done whatever until he said on that throne now I think David was smart after he climbs up and sits down on the throne he said oh Lord I don't well Noah knowing he write I'm serious I think when he got to facing it he said I don't know how they're learning now god I couldn't be killed until this took place now I can be killed cold I don't have any word for it Sam y'all were are you had tell me the future and he come back and Toby see do we put our confidence in brother branham being the Prophet we put our confidence in the basis of the prophet of this day told us these things the I don't understand everything he said I ain't never claimed to but I've always said this you give God time he'll give you the answer hours worth of troubles that we try to figure it out when I preach Daniel 70 weeks 1974 you ought to see my book my book I had a question mark everything brought around and said I didn't know what he said that had a question mark question mark question mark question mark question mark I'd read the book I could put it up because hey you remember what the Prophet said Daniel Sedin doing if you don't understand Daniel 7 weeks you don't understand the seals the files the plagues Allah now I didn't say that he's when it said it you see I put that book up then I come back and I read it again mmm take off about half that question you know cause something is coming through something filtering through and then that a while I just race that question huh I would not preach Daniel 70 weeks with one question mark marking down my book and look at it with one question marking that book I wouldn't preach it got on your wooden right but now I stand on that and have for 40 years coming let's see the Prophet told it and we believe it go right back where we started how are we gonna know whether we're born again or not you can't do it by his done yet what I'm saying right you can't understand the early ministry of the of the Prophet and the later ministry has been the same ministry and come out together with the right answer got to have them you know maybe I said that wrong you've got to have the early ministry in the later ministry you know what I'm saying you know what they're teaching into message you can't touch brother Brown him back in the old days but after the seals broke we'll take what he said well boy you in bad shape but I will tell you that there's a truth to it they wouldn't read of random talk body soul spirit it set the stage where you to sold people could quote brother around him and they said this away the soul is just the nature of the spirit they messed up there's not a quote where he said that yeah bring me one where he says then it's just the nature of the Holy Spirit no he always said it was the nature you say what's that carnal that's the stupidity death no it's not too stupid to mean it means one time if you say it's just the baptism it can be anything if you say it is the baptism now you got the Bible let me stay with this word come on musician let me get planted into this word you say well you're not a you're not afraid to produce what you believe no way I'm glad to produce what I believe to preach what I believe to declare what I believe because what I stood on has made the point that worth it a lot of these questions and answers if you're wait on God God will give you the answer but if you try to figure it out yourself he don't have to give us no answer leave it alone I've never tried to make nobody believe what I believe my family my wife my kids grandkids or anybody I don't try to make nobody believe what I believe I try to preach what I believe but I challenge you to bring one time and show me where I've missed the prophets message oh you're getting exalted now what is that word brother though they were saying little arc that little little little arrogant okay little little Erica put a little stupidity on top of it you coming down for the will where I'm at okay I'm just that honest to say one thing I don't care what they say about the Prophet because I'd like to see him come and stand before somebody that was genuine and them say the Prophet was wrong and you say okay you produce it you produce it because if he's wrong you're greater than he is if you can straighten out God we need to follow you that's where people are not getting this spirit in the last day the Antichrist spirit that's not getting it come on give me a second they're not getting it why because God has sent this among us to try us to see if we'll stay with the word or not he's left it to us he said one day he said God wants to prove that this bride is not to fall like a fail this for some little something oh you want some questions coming let's talk about questions don't play with your little bitty ideas get in the truth Who am I find out we're just anointed one okay we're gonna get to that you seen it so I'm gonna go ahead and say it this way what there's no difference in the anointing that was on Moses then there was the anointing that was on Balaam I don't know where do you agree with that that's your business if you agree then you set yourself up on a stage because here comes the next one where does the anointing fall okay we got the Prophet they fall down your spirit okay we'll get to that just even if falls on your spirit okay amen they falls on your spirit then we got that settled okay what about true born-again believer where does it do I've preached it and continued it ever since I started in this message a born-again believer is anointed in his spirit a false prophet is anointed in his spirit it's the same thing there's only one difference the true genuine according to the Bible when there's Jesus sowed the seed the Bible said they took the word and hailed it when the Holy Ghost fell all it had to come down was on your spirit and annoyance the word that's in your soul and makes your soul alive there's you new birth there's you anointed ones and there's your new birth is that soul in you does it agree with the word Mustang [Music] [Music] they don't want me laughs is wondering [Music] over together Sam [Music] [Applause] [Music] my [Music] in our brain that devices bringing me Emani [Applause] [Music] and [Music]
