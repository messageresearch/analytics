Jeffrey is going to make some tags you know kind of like they've done over in Alabama you know when everybody picked an uh a name you know and they was to pray for them for like a year pray for that person where you'll be more personal contact and he's going to make up some names and things and we'll be allowing you to draw a name and I told him and showed him that I've always in the book of Acts

remember uh Theo and our brother Richard's brother Lord as he's going through the operation today and that everything would be okay we love you and we thank you but God each one as we read your words you come and bless us together in that Grace in Jesus name amen Matthew 16. good to have her not a visitor she's been here many times before she's an alabamian but some way she got over here on 20 I guess and was able to come and visit with us but good to see you Matthew 16. and when Jesus came into the coast of caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man I am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist whom Elijah and others Jeremiah are one of the prophets now he made it personal see then he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am so evidently pointed to Peter you know or something in doing it and Simon Peter answered and said dark to Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thy shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven all right now let's go over to Psalms we'll go to chapter 8. verse 4. notice the reading now what is man the dark mindful of him and the son of man that thou visits him now we know that happened right all right for thou has made him a little lower than the angel who the son of man okay and has crowned him with Glory and Honor now watch Thou made us hymn to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou Hast put all things under his feet all sheep and oxen yea and the Beast of the field and the fowl of the hour and the fish of the sea and whatsoever passes through the paths of the sea all right so we could easily read then uh Genesis 1 26 and 27 couldn't we because that would relate to the man that he made and the son of man then come into that so you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we have some quotes for today yeah they're different these are a separate ones sold out to me we uh kind of want you to uh you know to read these things and store these away because it saves you a lot of trouble uh we went through the series on the um the corn of wheat dying falling into the ground you know and gave you those quotes and we went through then the the prophet saying that the bride would be the fullness or the godhead bodily so we gave you those and then if somebody comes along and says well we hear y'all believe so and so so we're here and it's red now we're talking about and we've been talking about uh last Sunday in the services we talked about the son of man and in that then we gave you a lot of quotes well if you take these and keep them you know then like I say you don't have to I put things in my Bible carrying case that if something comes up and somebody said something well I just roll in there and said well here read it you know and because my memories not that excellent so you know I can can do it that away a whole lot quicker what do they say the shortest pin is greater than the longest memory or something like that you know and uh so then we uh we appreciate the ability to be able to to do that no we spoke this past Sunday and dealt with the son of man all right and I pray that that would that helped you to understand and we will re-quote some things through the service today and if I can get through this afternoon uh then the Lord willingness coming Wednesday we will have questions and answers comments Etc uh I may try to if I get through today I may try Wednesday to just give you an overview of the whole thing all at one you know and gets our minds into the channel and then we can have the uh the questions and answers and comments because I appreciate your comments and and doing and you know uh because I don't give everything because there's no way to do it we we you know we never get through but I this morning sometimes I've got to thinking about and what I was thinking about was Paul in his statement when he said to let her killeth what the spirit giveth life all right and you know that really we create life or death by our words we create life or death by our very words that we use now the word create there is not meaning that we're so powerful of what we do we just it's what we are and what's taking place see death is actually perverting the word all right so then the word we use that's why we should be so careful in the the word in everything of trying to bring it because the word that we uh you know cherishing things we can take that and we can create with it are we you know either good or evil in our own selves and and that way you know I won't explain all of the other of what it was because it was related to a dream that I was having about something and I saw that we can take the word and we can destroy with it or we can take the word and we can exalt with it so that's one thing for sure that I want to do is try to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ because that's that's our purpose all right but think about it now we've been studying in the Book of Revelations Revelations 1. and uh getting that out of the the way of understanding and talking about that where it says on Revelations 1 12 and 13 you know did he uh he turned to see The Voice and when he turned to see The Voice then he saw one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the son of man it didn't say it was the son of man it was it was like unto the son of man all right and then that meaning that it's the son of man in another form when you're using the word lightness I went through all of that you know then it's it's the son of man in another form all right and that being the form it's in what it's in Bride form the prophet called it all right trying to find the day that we're living now this seems to in other words when I bring that out and try to express a little about undoing I'm maybe it's just me but I feel a pullback uh you know from you of what I'm trying to do and and I don't understand why you would do that because um every age the prophet said and I've got these laying here if you want them every age there's been a word for that age but there's been a prophet to bring the word of that age all right but there's been a people to make alive the word of that age brother random calls Martin Luther a prophet because he was a church-aged messenger all right now he wasn't a prophet like brother Brown no he wasn't a prophet like Paul Etc maybe but yet he was called a prophet you know I got in trouble trying to explain that one time but I can't help it run around and said it and I believe it that he was more than just a a FireFold Ministry man Martin Luther he was a church messenger he was an angel of that age all right but it wasn't and I said Luther that you know challenging the Catholic Church on a doctrinal issue that wasn't the problem of the day you know in what was going on it's when the people begin to believe what Martin Luther was teaching contrary to the Catholic church and what they had all been taught all right then they began to make manifest what Martin Luther was saying all right the church got upset why because they begin to lose people all right but that was the word of that age Moses was the word of his age right there's always been somebody a prophet brought and we believe that God sent us a prophet here in the last days we thank God for it and but now the point is if there was a prophet sent then there is a message to be made Alive by someone and it's not just that God sent a prophet God sent a prophet and and that's all we believe God sent a prophet all right amen we believe that right but it's when the people begin to say his brother around and said what when you begin to say I and my father won he said the shot's going to pull away when you begin to say we believe that God sent us a prophet in the last days and thank God but we believe that somebody's got to make manifest that word that he brought because that's what he was pointing to spoken words original seat said he'd be pointing to a word born bride all right see then that way then we believe and thank God for the the word that's been brought to us amen because we be junk without it that's just that's my common way of saying it we wouldn't be anything and we believe that God sent that prophet and he sent it to he'd send a prophet to every age now Moses was the prophet right but what was the point of being why did he send a prophet to lead the people out of Egypt right and take them to the promised land all right so Moses had his place his position but once the people got there to show the point of what I'm getting at Moses couldn't take him into the land right you had to raise up with Joshua from among them that had been in the service with Moses the whole time read your Bible Moses was right I mean Joshua was in the temple when they dedicated he was in there doing all of this that and the other all the things he was right there with Moses the whole time all right and when it did somebody had to take him over all right we know that Joshua represents who the Holy Spirit right all right see no man could take you in because you know right all that man can do is point you toward s right he can't take you into the land so there had to be a Joshua come up to represent the holy spirit that would take the people in all right so has it been in every age we just lose use Luther because everybody wants to well Luther ain't worth nothing you know there was nothing down through there well like I said you explain what the Bible says that God stood in the midst and you count your church ages and see where Luther name was at so if you want to make you know carnality out of it then he'd be greater back there than he is now see but see that's just a point of interest to you but yet to see that the word of each age has got to be made Alive by somebody Schumer brother random stirred up the world religious system yes he did but now suppose I'm just giving you an example because this is what came to me and I I just pulled the notes off while ago and looked at it six times brother random says that there's a word for each age just that wording just word for each age all right a portion of the word and a prophet to to bring the word that the people can become the word all right now it's not in your notes because I didn't give it to you okay but see where you and I are at then well we're just sitting down waiting you know just kind of waiting on something to happen well what's going to happen that's right but the prophet said win the Bride come on realizes who she is and what she's here for Satan's gonna get all upset well 40 something years now folks it's about time we're starting to realizing us don't explain you could take the whole message and put it on the internet around the world which is and on every radio station around the world and run it 24 hours a day did you start picking it apart because that's what they're doing right but when the people starts believing it you remember when they went to went overseas to the guy to find out where the Revival was you know and the police officer was standing there you know we want to know where the Welch Revival everybody was and he says you're looking at it all right when we begin to realize Who We Are we don't have to run out we're not going to empty hospitals we're not going to do all kind of thing because that's not in the line for today all right but we're going to have to be what he taught not just talk about it that's right but to be it we don't have any problems associating with the message do we all right I mean do you back up when somebody said what do you believe well you know I'm kind of a I kind of work anyway no uh and I don't land by action holler and scream you know he said what do you believe I believe that God sent a prophet for this day what yes you believe Luther come don't you you believe Wesley come don't you you'll be the Baptist come by John Smith or whatever well then I just believe that God sent a prophet amen all right but see somebody now has got to make the word alive not just talk about it not even just say well we're in the message but to just become the message and as I said we're not going to empty hospitals no but it don't mean we can't go in there and empty some rooms right it don't mean we can't pray for the sick because we believe it we believe in what's being happening all right but you get what I'm driving at and I've always taught you how long has it been I've taught this to you that in the Book of Revelations the book that they told us to stay out of because we could not understand it is the very book that we find ourselves in the most right because you never find Jesus in The Book of Revelation by himself he's always with somebody in somebody delivering and doing all right see that that's all I've tried to teach that's all I've done for 40 something years and just try to if you and I to realize the day and the hour that we're living and to recognize your day in this message amen we've got the quotes we've got the prophet's message all right but what about recognizing Who We Are I won't say it so you may not like it but even the ones that believe brother Brown was deity sometimes a whole lot stronger than you and I are about the word come on right even them that believe the falsies that they claim about his message they're out doing things you know I mean there's going overseas they're sending out all kinds of things and then turn around and tell you they didn't believe all he talked but at least they're doing something instead of just well I believe the message now all right but listen folks we talked about last Sunday as the son of man we'll get back to this in a little bit we'll run around and says I am not the son of man he said Jesus is the son of man the Son of God the son of David and even in my teaching if you'll watch it what I'm trying to hold it I never declared that you and I as the bride of Christ would be the son of David because that's the wrong dispensation wrong time that's the Millennium in the things but just trying to recognize the day that we're living and realize that we have to become the word and to become the word then Luther was the word made flesh for the day he was in the people that really believe that not the fanaticism but the real true Lutheran they were the word made flesh of that day well that's all I'm talking about you're an opinion if you want to know what I'm teaching that's what I'm telling I'm just trying to get you and I to realize who we are and what's going on because nobody has ever been worth anything in the Bible until they realize what was going on right right the best Moses could do would 16 years or 20 years or whatever he was with his mama and her saying you're not that is that Egyptian Pharaoh's son you're a Jew you know and you're chosen for a special job which you know that didn't do him no good got him a dead Egyptian right but five minutes in front of the burning bush the prophet said meant more than all the years of his teaching I become personal unto him he wasn't afraid I mean come on you know yourself you're going to the movies to make the movie to make it look good but you know yourself that I told him not to come back to Egypt you know that because they really didn't figure he'd live you know when they sent him in the desert which you know they told him not to come back well you know for 40 years he didn't go back all a mom was teaching couldn't put him back the five minutes of that burning bush he goes home tell his wife get ready we're going we're going to Egypt we're going to take over I imagine she probably the poorer I remember she probably fussed with him a whole lot you know on the way but you know what it happened he went down took over but now get down to the point was it Moses they was scared of sure the stick the different things but they they manufactured them things you remember they could do everything Moses done except take away but when the people begin to Rally around a message that Moses was bringing the Egyptians got concerned that's all I want you and I to see we find our place in the word all right The Book of Revelations is where you're going to find yourself because somebody else has already made all these others manifest but they never made the things that's in the Book of Revelations manifest sure they're a part of it I've talked to you that away we don't teach the son of manage just to be the end time people it's a bride down to all the ages because it's one like another son of man is shown standing in the midst of the seven golden candles Revelation 1 13. amen amen all right they were the word for their hour but what are we to be the word of the hour there's a talk she's been trying to just review just a point in the Book of Revelations you don't see him as a physical being right he's always in a symbolics right You Don't See John didn't turn to see the son of man standing there the Lord Jesus Christ but he turned to see The Voice now he was expecting to see Jesus when he turned I imagine it was a little shock to him he wrote the symbol he knew what it was he knew that voice so then when that voice spoke from that seven golden candlesticks he knew you know what was going on that was not a physical Corporal standing it was a symbolic form but as we'll try to get to today now we talk about the son of man last Sunday but they will talk about the son of man in Bride form in the form of the word the message that you and I have received as I've said to you for 40 something years Paul and them didn't I keep saying that for you to think about it Paul and them didn't speak of Son of Man no but as quick as running around and started in the 40s he he was talking about the son of man all right being revealed of course everybody you know there he is we've seen it then but we don't see nothing now you know we're just waiting around until Obama takes over Earl Hootie comes after or what's what's the Palin and what's the girl woman's name Hillary maybe when Hillary and Palin takes over and we get a new profile stage boy we're going to heaven then like I told him in a fellowship meeting if we don't hurry up and do something we're going to be having Fellowship meetings or services in the nursing home right because it's going to be more of us dire than they are here but that'd be great wouldn't it be great to be sitting in a nursing home what are we going to do tomorrow we're going to talk about the message what are we going to do the next day we're going to talk about the message and you know what we'll all have such a problem of memory do we won't remember we talked about it today before right I mean I'm honest come on do you think about it see I don't have nothing but this message I mean that's all I've got you know but think about it now that was in while we're not a denomination where brother Brown said he turned to see The Voice he said it was a bride standing right there a bride right all right but then he went into the seventh the uh seven Church ages It Was Written you know 54 now 412 I think it is where he saw not a man but he saw a woman or about to perhaps feminish bride form a bride's standing there are standing in the Mist see who is this the prophesive his bride huh he lived through the church ages as Son of God but then he's to be revealed in the last days of the son of man the word made flesh we went through those things right now but look let's make sure because I don't want you to misunderstand me but I don't want to harp to death about something but you know I'll sit down with people and they'll start talking they'll say I didn't see that till you went over it well maybe that's a problem with my memory I don't remember what I preached so I preach it over again so that's all right we get in a nursing home we went on no problem you know all right but they won't have to give us a bunch of pills because we'll be peeled upon the word but now come on folks 1969 in Athens Georgia I tried my best to explain that the bride by the quotes of the Prophet would be the son of man in the last days all right you know how hard it was then to say it because that voice well he's missed a brother Branham was the son of man I gave the quote just like I give them to you the other day questions and answers from 64. he said I am not the son of man I am not the son of man but a son of man he said there's quite a difference now remember what it was shown in the we gave the quotes the other day where in Revelation 1 13 and we're going on down brother Branham says this is not a prophet this is God all right see a prophet can can represent us John represented us on Patmos as being raised up yes but there has to be a people follow that one day all right what you see it comes down then to the point of where he's saying I'm not the son of man we went on into and we've been through it on anointed ones at the end times they want to throw these up pick up number two where you can read some of them if you don't you got the notes laying there and they got them on the Internet in the very day there's a son of man is revealed Revelations 10 1-7 read it when you get home the seventh Angels message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now he says that's where it seems to be so hard for you you see not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it's left to shook Now where's that at all of the message about the grain the corn of Wheat and the son of man is to return in the last days all right and it's the grain itself again but here we go that's what I said that that blank stain hits me when I get there and maybe it's blank me instead of blank you but I just don't see nothing going on and we believe we was that we would we would be seeing however kind of signed and wonder I believe we are around the world and then you want to argue with a little little about it because we can produce the tapes even from years ago where the Dead's been raised the six been healed storms just went out of existence rain has come when it hadn't rained how many more things can we go to but I don't see nothing going on well it's not going to change anybody but you see Church he goes on to say on the mark of the beast in 61. see that goes up 65 back 61. the angel of the Lord set with his back turned now now I hope you I hope you all get this I am not the angel of the Lord I'm William Branham right now what's he talking about he wasn't denying denying that he was the seventh Church age messenger was he wasn't denying that he was the angel of the Lord to say he's talking about that angel I'm not that I I'm William Branham I'm not that angel what'd he say he said I just wanted to use this right that angel is the Lord Jesus Christ and the Lord Jesus Christ is the son of man when are we going to get it down to where we can lay it in order and say this is what we believe you know what we can't make it manifest do what you want to you can't manifest nothing I can't either if God used you to call life back it wasn't you it was God same ways right over here in the church right beside of us today if something happens over there it's God right see that's the way it's supposed to be all right but now listen look what he says when we get over to the in order to end time paragraph 26.9 number four on the notes and we'll we'll start from this point and then we'll we'll try to move on this is paragraph 269. he's talking about trying to come down about myself you know see he said you know people think he's talking about himself when he said and I was listening to him last night and he said there's a man back here behind me he said his name is so-and-so wonderful it happened right we believe it but that wasn't him that wasn't brought around him well he's describing the son of man was and he said he wasn't the son of man the son of man's the Lord Jesus Christ well now there you are trying to make the bride no if he becomes one with the bride he's making himself right come on that's all I'm talking about being that I was packing the message I have no more to do with it then nothing no more than just a voice and my voice even against my better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father that I declared to that I declare to do and determine to do I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect they are I'm only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it wasn't what I knew it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man see if you make him become a man you're going into deity and that's what people don't realize he said well wait a minute we got you because you believe the bride is the son of man that's right and I believe she's deity don't you come on I may just read these after we get through with a I thought we believed that we were little Messiahs I thought we were the little eaglets I thought we were the deity made manifest that's where I thought the prophets taught us but that don't make us nothing that makes him something it wasn't the seventh angel no it was a manifestation son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded so that's a mystery they were sealed up in the Bible it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man so he's talking about the word right come on look at the next one it's rising in the sun preaching 65 4 18. now who is this son of man he's asked the question and look what he goes to in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us why because he was the son of man the son of God and he'll beat the son of David what is the Lord Jesus Christ it's not brother Branham it's the word it's the message that's why most people don't even read enough to go to like future home and and uh at least on the Rapture too he was talking about you know his message didn't begin until 63. the rest of it was a restoration back up to where we had lost away then he began to bring his message but look look at him as we get to prove in his word 64. paragraph 221 and then we'll go to 222 and we'll get through it he's coming down and he's bringing it to the lady'll see an age and promise it's promised in Luke 17 30 that this same son of man he promised it would be revealed in the days like it was in Sodom upon the Earth all right now what happened in Sodom two men went to Sodom right but that was the son of man because they were in that form bringing it a Sodom all right now in bringing it then now it's like that those two men was not Jesus Christ's human flesh but yet he was inside of a created flesh right well all right thank God look I said do you get it did it have to come to pass it's impossible now remember you come in three names the son of man a prophet Son of God the spirit the son of David for the Millennium but in between this conjunction ain't what he's getting over to the last age right now according to his own words in the day when the son of man shall be revealed revealing himself that's what not Son of God Son of Man will reveal himself in a different way now what does that make Malachi 4. all right come on we got that right the messenger bringing the message the prophet bringing the word amen we got in the right order but there's a little more to read all right see the son of man will reveal himself not in a whole big denomination of things as we've had Through the Ages but he would manifest himself as son of man again to make manifest Malachi 4. and in that day I'll send to you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the heart so the children back to the face of the apostolic fathers away from all these denominations and come back to the original word again to draw out what that last day bride the tree that he promised in the evening time it shall be light not through the Misty days when they've been in the evening rolling up to paragraph 222. which is the next that was 221 go to 222 and look and the son of man is revealing himself in the same power that he was not down to the church ages through justification sanctification and these things here but the son of man see none of those ages had a prophet standing to declare the resurrection sign because that is the son of man the son of man is a resurrection sign and that's why it had to wait till the end time all right who is this son of man the word the word is quicker than powerful than a two-edged sword and discern the thoughts that's in the heart what did he have to do he has to prove that word what would he do notice of it when we see it happening look at it in the same form that he was here in the beginning the pillar of fire my proving that he's Hebrews 13 8. proving it see we look back and we see brother around and when we know that had to be God used now even like all of these people that are are trying to prove him so wrong right they still say he had the gift they still say God used the man right right you don't hear in all of these things that he was wrong that that he was off the they say he's off the word but they never said he didn't have the ministry of Jesus Christ right right come on Church look he comes on down what do you say that was Christ when Paul was speaking here today and you believe that in the New Testament then the son of man the same Christ in the last days all right it was on through John 14 12. not in Luther's age not in Wesley not Pentecostal age not Baptist not Presbyterian age we went right down through it and proved it by the history in the Bible but what in the age of the son of man being revealed to breathe these things to fulfill the word when all must be fulfilled you see it it's true his age this time look where you and I are standing look at him as it goes on and proving his word paragraph 235. excuse me wait a minute you know how many of these down wrong I got a 6A and a 6B but we'll have to make sure we get this paragraph correctly all right you believe that he promised these things to happen in the last days that the same son of man will be made manifest now remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there Now read it that could discern the thoughts of Sarah's mind behind him he said that was not Jesus well that's not the flesh man who was it it was the Christ come on it was not Jesus talking to Abraham there that could discern the thoughts and Sarah's mind behind her that was not Jesus he had not yet been born look at it but it was a man in human flesh right that Abraham called Elohim the great Almighty Jesus said it wasn't a day to Sodom now what's close in the days of Sorrow so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church the not no more the bride is called in that day there son of man will be revealed what to join the church and the head who was the job that done that run around them right come on he was the man that brought the message to join the head and the body together how much more could we give him and a great honor you're not the marriage of the Bride bride room will come right down through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh do you not the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it takes the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergy I don't know not a clergyman clergy man or I don't know do you see what I mean the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper I believe that the prophet brought the message to you now that was the man standing there was a human flesh well God was inside of there like I said called a man out behind him that wasn't brother Brown he'd stand there he said you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on him huh go ahead it's the wrong way look what you're making he goes on to tell she's already United but then go ahead when the word here unites with the person and they too become one and then what does it it do then it manifests the son of man again are you reading when the word hear unites with a person 's part come on and they too become one then what does it do it manifests the son of man not the church theologians the son of man the word into church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same amen it's not going to be me and you it's what he himself makes manifest there is nobody can heal the sick no human being there is nobody can raise the dead there's nobody can do all these things we're giving all the honor and glory to Jesus Christ wrote a random dead right and you know why that God would come on the scene is because he gave him all the honor and Glory do you think God would have come on the scene had he walked out there never got something behind so just remember when you're thinking if he'd walked out there and said look what I can do yeah now do you think God would work if he did it would have been like Elisha with a she-birth right around said it was not God it was a gift of the prophet in other words you remember they said to brother Branham show us where that oil is and we will give the money he said he knew they wouldn't do it he said I knew in other words or maybe not those exact wordings but he knew where it was at he said they dug all around over the place and didn't do it he said then somebody else come in set up on one well and hit a gusher see he knew where to tell him we'll see God told him not to tell him that's what's wrong with Balaam right what a problem with Balaam he was a prophet but his problem was he wouldn't listen to God right what are you understanding let's read a little bit more then we'll quit and we'll pick us up this evening but go to the restoration of the Bride tree number seven uh 62 422 paragraph five forty one then he's talking about making himself known and all like that and then he says you promised to do it in the evening time you've promised to do it in the last days you said and so shall it be in the coming of the son of man was in the days of lot so shall it be God living in human flesh moving Among Us in the form of his church okay in the Holy Spirit performing the same sign now there you go see but we don't see the signs as I said while ago if he's over in that Baptist Church right here beside of us and something happens that's God yeah we want to see this and we want to see that now let me ask you a simple question that bears on my heart all the time I've taught you all the time I believe the ministry of Jesus Christ is around the world I got a whole bunch of notes after this I don't know maybe I'll preached on the same Ministry one of these days but listen folks they surround the world amen but you'd say well well brother Dale why am I sick why don't you just speak it and I'll get well I like what they said Jack Cole said now I'm just quoting I don't know it but he said the man said if you got what you think you got get me up off this chair he said if you think you got what you've got you get up that's it right you get up right but see I believe the ministry of Jesus Christ is around the world but the point is how can he be a Healer if ain't somebody's sick that's it I thought we believe adoption the word it would be that we would need rain and somebody would call for it and we've seen that happen but you know what you don't pray for rain in a monsoon season so he's got to allow these things to happen come on you've got to allow it to happen he's going to allow us to be sick where he can heal us what come on folks you know I mean this out there and it's raining and it's two foot deep and you say we need to get together today and Pray For Rain where we manifest Son of God no we needed for the rain to quit and let it be manifest all I'm trying to do is get you and I to see where God is around the world working in his bride and you put together all the things that he's doing and you got the ministry of Jesus Christ the same as he was Dire none of us are trying to be what brother random was there was only one Elijah right but there's a bride to believe it in the form of his church he just said look at Christ and Mr God revealed paragraph Force 57. as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and as today's a lot when a mother and Billy Gray or more Roberts went down and Sodom and preached into them sodomized and blinded her eyes see with the gospel you know it's so odd that we can't accept what the man would say oh we do I believe everything you see I want you to read that and tell me you believe it that God was in Oral Roberts and Billy Graham oh well you put it in a different way no I didn't oral Robertson Billy Graham was just part of my messengers do we believe that well you know what God was using them no if they had anything they'd be in this message I mean it is it in you it's all I asked okay look one Angel stayed back a messenger with Abraham and the elected group and what kind of a sign did he do see and what did Abraham call him Elohim God manifests in flesh Jesus showing that he himself God in him will be manifested in his bride in the last days oh my my just no end to it it's a revelation of God it's Eternal just keep moving on and on and on that God would be manifest in his bride in the last days let me read one more and then we'll quit take it up this evening sir as we would see Jesus number nine on you paragraph 161. Jesus was God in flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight it's still God manifest himself in the last days the son of man revealing himself in his church now I didn't say these things the human flesh making himself known you get it God down here in his church making himself again the word the son of man being revealed in the last days as it was in the days of Sodom you see everybody's hung on brother random son of man right we know his position his place and what he was we honor that we're quoting what he says there the unit's not saying all of it well come on bring you quotes show me something contrary to what I've taught for 40 something years but you know people think you're exalted you're you're some kind of doing something when I say that in 1969 I preached that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man in the last days who you think you are I'm me who are you where was you at in 1969 playing around Walmart they had them back then I guess might not have had them it was five and ten cents store Woolworth okay Marsh was there I'm not being sarcastic I'm telling the truth you talk to people I don't know whether he said that or not why don't you know you know all about Obama you know all about oh Francis right you can tell every time he done anything and all he done well I don't read them things I don't have time the fool with junk I told him in a fellowship meeting in Alabama I'm pretty sure it was over there years ago when they were talking about it for the for Obama was elected I said I was talking about everybody was talking about this and everybody talking every preacher got up said something about it I got up and I figured they probably knew I was going to say something smart you know I got a fire set y'all won't know who's gonna be president I said you want me to tell you tell you who's going to be president nobody wouldn't say yeah I said would you like for me to tell you who's going to be president somebody said yeah I said the Bible said I put in Kings and I take out Kings I said ever who God wants to be president of the United States whether it be a woman or whether it be an Obama or who it be it'll be what God has placed in there for the reason to bring you and I to the place that we need to be if McCain had got it we'd have probably been in worser shape go to an older man he wouldn't have put up with a lot of the young junks I told you my thoughts are they put in Obama because he was a young man the old people's got the money sitting on it the young people don't give a hoot as long as they got something to eat and drugs so Obama got in the middle that ain't gonna give drugs to young people yeah huh right is about every state now voting where they're not taking allow medical drugs and hi folks I'm not an idiot neither am I sarcastic there are some sicknesses that these medicated marijuana might be real good come on you went through all of those Redlands or what is that thing where you put your kids on it you tell me that's not dope come on Church wake up I'm just trying to get us to see the hour that we're living what does it matter who's going to be president what does it matter a profile of the United States it'll be when God ordains it to be but if you and I are not ready we're gonna fall for it right what's going to happen they come up one day and cut out your Social Security oh they can't do that you know everybody's talking about Obama says when you're about 70 something you know if you got something just give him drugs let him die I don't try to treat him you know whatever you know we're seeing what the prophet stood back there 50 years ago and talked about a day when it would become that you'd belong as I was bringing out the other day statue of perfect man where he says keep your home belong to the Catholic Church well brother Dale explain that keep your home belong to the Catholic Church I just explained it what if you keep your homes you belong to the Catholic church because that's what he said but come on folks I've told you a lot of things he said he said if you know what you had in your pockets you'd take out burn it but he didn't take his and burn it right why cause you're a human being so he wasn't telling us to do them things he's just telling us what we had the money in your pocket is connected to the Catholic church because they got the gold to back it up what if they demand right now what is China come on musicians what is China right now demanded all of their payment that we've borrowed from a third world country to be able to exist on Social Security I mean I'm looking at my own kids I'm looking at my own what would happen if they said no more Social Security no more General Motors paychecks is my kids going to jump in and take care of benman Nanny it's gonna cost you if you do right you realize what a stroke of the pen could cause Mass confusion you realize you have no food in storage the food is from the farmer to the market it is not stored up my Lord back in the 60s we gave Russia all of our wheat I remember that when I was in school see there's a stroke of the pen they can do anything they want to you say oh they can't do that to me I'm bride what if that's what God is going to allow to happen to bring you and I to our knees the dean I talked a while ago about brother Ryan talking about desperation you know there's a lot in desperation you go study well you take some people they just take desperation one time they will never quote the other but around the city you're going to be desperate to perish he turned around says you can't get desperate that's right he said God got to make you desperate right and he'll explain a person healed in the church or to throw the whole church into desperation why don't you say all he says on a topic instead of just one thought can you take anything you want to make him say anything you want him to say but take it all you see a church we have had a wonderful marvelous message that's why I believe there is nothing wrong with the message the messenger he was a human being that had problems in his life the messenger the carrier the man William Branham could had wrongs but his message is the saith Lord I'm not talking about the stupidity of people oh he repeated himself God don't repeat itself he don't verily verily I say unto thee verily verily is two times early right come on get it right but you see Church we're going to have to be we're going to have to have ourselves mentally prepared for what is to take place in the last days what is it the Mormons or Jehovah Witness one has a year Supply Foods toward it Mormons that's not too bad of an idea you know I think you ought to have something stored up in your house so what are you going to do if the power goes off what are you going to do if the if it comes with snow what are you gonna eat you can't eat the grass because it was snow but I don't think you have to do like we done we had enough in our house at one time to fed this whole church for over a year well you know it got getting pretty old you know what we've done with it somebody give I think Terence a pig I don't remember where he bought it or something wound up he got a pig you know what we've done we took that food and we fed that pig and that was a fattest pig he was so fat he couldn't stand up and eat he'd sat down in Eagle he couldn't even stick his own head down like a normal Pig you know what we hate that booger you know what he could but you know what we got cam stuff in our basement we can pinto beans come on sisters makes it a whole lot easier on you because how many of you have pinto beans you got to cook them four hours right or Black Eyed Peas you got to cook them four hours if you're a count them in a pressure cooker you pop them up warm them and they're ready to eat yeah white said it's gonna happen why not be prepared against that day that's right but just remember you got to remember a lot because you start cooking and somebody next door is going to come find out what you've eaten so it might be that we will have to speak on the table while we eat and ask the Lord say Lord make sure it ain't no smell to these pinto beans I know I'm silly but is it right I mean is it right you know and Lord just don't let nobody else see how fat we are the prophet says we're not but he said we'd go through a persecution not a tribulation no way what do we got brother let's stand number 98 98 it's probably watching for the coming all the Glad Millennial day when our blessed Lords it's just waiting right away oh my heart is filled with rapture eternally okay after Jesus shall come back Jesus coming back will be the answer you were a sore and cry for the knowledge of the Lord shall fill
