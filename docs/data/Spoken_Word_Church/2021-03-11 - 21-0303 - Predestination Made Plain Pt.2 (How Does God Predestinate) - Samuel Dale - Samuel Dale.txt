========================================

us who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him now i like that and they even you know circle to let you know what it's talking about in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now tempted to bring some things are out um sunday of talking about predestination all right i think we need to emphasize strong statements to let you know where we stand and in doing that then you say well well i just don't agree with that well that's all right that's your business then when you ask me what do i stand on where do i stand that's where i stand i stand on what i can believe about the word of god and what god has delivered to us through all of these years that he has guided us and taken care of us and brought us through all of the the problems and heartaches and troubles that's been in the world and all kinds of things and brought us to a place that we can you know relax and say okay we've come this far so they ain't no need of throwing up our hands let's just keep going let's just keep on walking and doing the best we can do and following in the love of god all right and i was talking about it because the little thought was is uh you know predestination you remember we've done a little series there on the god head made simple trying to break that down to where we could understand and then that way you can say well okay uh we used everything that we could use i did or tried to that thinking that even somebody else would come up with an idea of this and that or the other i tried to cut that off into as much as i could of understanding of the truth of god's word and that's what i want to do in this part now we had a service about we'll take this in part two i don't know what we'll do from on out that's no problem we'll we'll try to survive somewhere and have something to speak to preach on but what was our thought now predestination made plain i didn't give you any more notes any more thoughts other than just leaving it to where we could just take this and look over it and follow it and go through into what we want to cover for the night all right predestination made plain or simple you know if we take everything in the simplified way what a wonderful thing it would be that was one thing i was trying to explain and have tried to explain about this book this bible you know this is a bible written about people people all the way through people you know it is not necessarily written about this that it's written about people you know because it covers people from the beginning all other things and then it winds up in the end that we get down to the end of the story only thing i like about this book i've read it for years and years and and i went to the end of it and go back to the beginning and go to the end of it and you know what i've never found the end of it have you ever found the end of the bible i never have you know like a story being in life it would say the end are they riding off you know into the sunset on the horseback and saying the end well there's no way to put an end to the bible i've told you what i believe and the reason i believe it i believe we're just getting enough of the word of god while we are here in this world to be able to understand the things that are coming and the prophet said god would give us his message of cheer down through the endless ages what about that it's just being we're just now beginning because see i i i've thought about just doing it and you know you could start and we've been doing it but we just didn't call it that away and and these brothers are doing it these ministers are doing it is you know you can just read what happened in genesis well you know what that was the people made that manifest you know it said and this and this and he created this and he'd done this and you know somebody or something made that manifest all right see then we're still in the writing of the book it's not finished we're in the writing of the book it's talking about us now this is not talking about the the disciples it's not talking about abraham they ain't talking about david it ain't talking about it's talking about me and you we are the ones that the end of the world has come upon all right if we don't if we don't live out long enough to see the end of it somebody will but you know that has to be somebody alive according to the word all right find yourself in the word but i tried to tell you you know you got the natural part written there all right you got all god said and all happened and with adam and all that happened with with cain and abel and and the things and coming on down and coming to abraham and all of the things and you see every bit of that you realize those people made that manifest all right now if i can get to the story part of it i it's my mind is just i'm wondering how it's going to happen and what it's going to come forth in the message because i believe i see something but i want to be able to make it to where you can see it but it wouldn't have nothing to be able just me to see it and then you know throwing it out and all i want you to see it and i want you to question it we should have questions and answers i love questions and answers i wish we could get back and maybe we can make some plans to have one like a saturday night questions and answers like we've always had before i enjoy that that is that is a wonderful time we can set a father apart we can move around we can do things and not be so congested in doing it you know we can we can handle of the things but i i enjoy questions and brother branham said questions makes a strong church yeah he says a lot of things it's hard to be understood the bible says a lot of things it's hard to be understood right how could questions make a strong church when the bible tells you to not fool with questions the gender strife right all right you say well i'm saying well all right say what the prophet said he said the bible is the word of god all right all we got to do is just read it but see we try to read it our our way you know and see then the word of god is so perfect that we don't need to add anything to it or take away from it or try to figure it out is just read it and it says and god created that took place you've heard your prophet say those lines when it said and god created the heavens and the earth he said amen god created man that was just god created man that took place one day well so is it now among us i told you i believe we're living the bible right now if not what do you think we're doing i'd like to get your definition of what you think this world is like and what it's going to be or what it's going to turn that's why i'm not concerned with it i've told you over and over this virus and stuff like that that's tribulation that working patience that is not the tribulation because if it is you and i are lost now that's as plain as i can make it and back it up with the bible because we're not supposed to be here in the tribulation well that makes it simple then man look how simple the bible is the bride's not going to go through the tribulation all right that's right you know what that means i can look around and say well okay we're still here if i am part of that and a part of the bride then there can't be no tribulation taking place oh there can be all kinds of things happening no but they can't be because i'm here you don't think of yourself like that think of living the word we've talked about the word and how the word is to be made alive well think about it you're part of the word then god is not complete without you because you're his children okay let's get on to the point so predestination made plain to us is one thing we can read notes we can go through where the prophet told us that predestination you know looks forward to destiny before knowledge goes back we can go through all of the quotes and the bringing down of these things and that's wonderful and i tried to do that a little bit darwini last sunday you know of the services of doing it but what are we doing what are we looking for something else because if it's made plain then it's plain what the prophet said he had to say the bible is full of it those who he foreknew he did predestinate right elect according to foreknowledge which comes first then for knowledge or predestination then your prophet comes along verifying it quote after quote after quote throughout the message especially when you get into the uh later years after the opening of the seals i don't mean it brings out a different thing it just brings out deeper meaning deeper understanding if you're going to talk about now the people that's message like to get into these type of things they like to think about oh i always was eternal always was eternal brother dale i can just feel it feel it well let me say it to you this way if you can bring that's why these people don't come because they know better into about tackling what's being said you come and you bring all the quotes about the fact of you being eternal and you know what i'll finish by saying the prophet said predestination looks back to full knowledge for knowledge look to destiny so if you always was eternal then that's in god's foreknowledge because we don't believe it that way sure i believe that that the fact that god when he foresaw it sure we are here and when we reach the position of understanding when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost into your soul your soul is made eternal right all right then made eternal by the life of god coming into you then you can say my soul always was eternal because it is in the basis of god giving it to me but it don't mean that it was there until a time come that's what i want you to see about predestination it's very simple you just look at it you just read it and you say there it is but see you come with the points of trying to bring some great doctrinal thing all i'm going to do is just keep saying it god looks back to foreknowledge and predestinated all things before knowledge but you see what people don't want to do they don't want to tie together all of the whole story and to think it this way that everybody in the world that ever has been in the world ever will be in the world all is predestinated by god's foreknowledge that's simple then you ain't trying to figure out a bride for this part here you ain't trying to figure out this to fit over here and it's to go there right it's all about foreknowledge god foreknew and if he didn't foreknow it if he's not capable of foreknowing it what kind of a god do we have see i always say it i'm sorry that god knows my heart on the point but i always say what do we think we've got a peanut brain for a god i like that illustration the prophet gay said a gnat and every time he'd bat its eye and how much taller it would make i like that you know what that means that means god for new all things that means he's infinite amen he don't how to think it over and when he says this will happen why can't we believe that'll happen you see but but the point of what i'm getting see it's like the woman in the white house see before the foundation of the world you think god didn't know that but there wasn't a time that could take place until now but now that's taken place all right like terrence said if we had a bunch of dummies and a thought it out back when the prophet said that the catholic church had one of 68 billion or something of what they had and if we just thought of that about 1970 somewhere right in there and and you know gold if we'd have just thought of that and went and bought a whole bunch of it look how rich we'd be you don't think that way look how rich we'd be ain't trying to be rich but i'm trying to talk about the truth so anything that you see taking place that the bible speaks of now are you following me listen i'm trying to get a point and then we'll move over a little everything that you can think about it whether it be world war one world war ii and world war iii that had to take place because the bible had said it yes that was not an addition to the word of god that was the three woes the things of the bible all of that was in there in the scriptures and yet we were trying our best to figure out what this means like i've told you and i'm not throwing off on him my brother-in-law he believed that that uh whether you know that uh you mark of the beast and the thing like that he believed that a big old king kong animal gonna walk or a man or something walk across the earth i looked and i said is that going to be deceiving i mean when you got a big old king kong animal walking what has that got to do with with religion me and even it did if it did happen that way it would be the fact of god's foreknowledge coming into being that he had predetermined it because of the full knowledge he had that's simple it's simple to think about predestination if you think of it that god foreknew all things see your question whether or not god is real all right but you see how does god predestinate by his foreknowledge anything that's going to take place into the world it's already written in the book of life because that's what i love about it all whose names were not written you know a lot of people's names was not written in here but it was written about them right it was written about them then you could say their names was in there what does that mean their names were not in there they're not part of the word that's just what i want to get to if i can in the measure but don't i'll get it later what's the difference in in salvation for the old testament and salvation for the new i will make the statement and stand by the statement whatever saved abraham will save you if you get it right a lot goes between there because the abraham was back there under the blood of bulls and ghosts we're under the blood of jesus christ okay but still there's one thing about it god foreknew it god foreknew it i asked you a simple question i liked it that way i released another day and i thought why don't i keep saying that i'm going to ask you a simple question i just want to ask you a simple question does god predetermine by his foreknowledge or does he predetermined by his desires he can't predestinate by his desires and the fact that he desired it all be saved right you desire anybody to be lost we choose those things but you think he didn't know your choice well yes see we want to take something on the side and pull it over and work it around so much like that god didn't choose me i i mean god i didn't choose god god chose me all right you're right but if you use it wrong you're wrong you just use that little statement wrong way you're wrong because remember one thing god can't override your free moral agency he will not save you he will not make you be saved he couldn't set back before the world and predetermine you to be saved but at the same time predetermined you to be lost now what kind of a god is that i'm trying to get us to the point of one thing how simple it is if we just think about it correctly god forenew foresaw for ordained predetermined whatever the thoughts or ideas that you want to put in it all things you think he didn't know everything you think he knew some things but he didn't know the other well what i like about it is that he foreknew everything but then he turned around one day and said blessed is a man to whom god will not impute sin and the same man he said that about which was david the same man he said he's a man after my own heart he's a murderer an adulteress what you see it's not made to be figured out that a way you don't question why he did it i can ask you a question what made god come to you and save you when the world is full of a whole lot better people than you and me you agree with that that do a whole lot more for god than me and you they may do what's this all about who triggered what who brought what into being if you'll simply go back to the basis and god foreign then you've got a starting point you've got something to anchor it in you don't have to question you look back and said he's seen this he saw that woman walk in the white house that was his word to me that's as much of the word of god as it is of anything else you could talk about russia china whatever all those things are in the word of god there's a natural book that is called the bible i don't know what that'd be the correct way of saying it in a natural book again but it's anywhere else a book that contains all things because remember one thing according to book of daniel you've got to deal with books and books it's more than just one book amen there's one book of life there's one book of the center you've got books why because it takes all of that to cover the world see that way he has a place of knowing what to do is i've always tried to get you to look at something in the correct way i believe in predestination like this there was exa in the denominational world we used to teach it because i remember that they used to teach that the ark was so big that everybody in the world could got on it if they'd wanted to and i remember then said no no no he made it for exactly how many they were right that's right he never left an extra space just in case one of the guys crawls on we haul him around for three or four months on the outside and we let him come inside and we give him a space nah that's just all silly that's what i'm trying to be it's silly with you he knew exactly how many that ark would hold they didn't have a crash on the the food because it wasn't enough everything was there he made it all but you know what now listen that's in this book as a natural story because that was a man not under the blood of bull i mean under the blood of jesus christ that's right amen that was a man that dwelt back there when it was not under the salvation that we talk about but think about it what caused see if you'll take it and just get the predestination get it straight other foreign then you can answer the question what caused or determined what god would do when this world started it can't be what he wanted to do we know that we can we can read those things in the prophet because he didn't do it all right but it can be from the basis that he knew all things then if he knew all things then why are we worried about it well brother dale i'm just worried whether i'm saved or not well why the bible tells you how to be saved right tells you exactly the way to be and what to do and everything and god has written his word to tell us those things you think he won't keep his word if it's not by foreknowledge what would it be by and if it is by foreknowledge then why can't we believe it why can't you take your healing on the basis of four knowledge because according to foreknowledge the bible says they see he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation world which could heal could deliver could save et cetera et cetera that's just for knowledge well all you got to do is find out what day you're living in right around said god predestinated a seed forever age a word for every age but we want to go with what we're thinking about oh i'm always was eternal if you always was eternal then jesus christ died in vain because he was predetermined predestinated for knowledge to die for the sins of the world according to the scriptures chosen us in him before the foundation of the world well you know it's over with why can't we believe it that way see we're wanting it to happen when i'm trying to tell you the bible is so full of what has already happened why should i worry about what's going on now i should rejoice and say thank you lord what caused god to predetermine are you listening what caused him to predetermine if you're going any other way than the fact of his foreknowledge then you're making him setting the destiny of all things and if he doesn't do everybody the same way then we're all in bad trouble but you see the sinner can't say you made me wrong he says i sit down i've done everything said i even sent my word and brought it to you now we're not talking about down through the ages and the time we're talking about right now like we were saying one day said ain't no need to worry about abraham that's done what you never you have never thought about i was trying to express it there sunday and just easing along with it because you never thought about why would abraham be called a friend of god and why would he be called the father of the faith he is our father in the basis of the gospel and what was that that's why i love the scriptures it gives you the answer abraham believed god remember in the scripture and it was imputed or imparted or per for preset you ain't never thought about it it just hit me when i started on this trying to get things and i know i can't get it the way i want it but you know that abraham was given an unconditional covenant now does that mean that abraham can do anything he wants to do and get by with it and still be saved what about it what is an unconditional covenant what about it being a covenant that was god predetermined this to be that away but why and how could he do it with abraham especially because we're staying with the old testament for you to understand it that way how can it be of those that are not in the new birth and the age and the thing that we are and to think about abraham and him be a friend of god i don't believe in the fact that god picks one and cast off the other one no but i do believe that according to foreknowledge and the natural writing of this bible that did take place exactly because he loved jacob and hated esau how could it be anything that god could hate when he is not the author of hate what are you doing what are you thinking but abraham didn't have anything to do with it well what stirred god one day and he went down to a man genesis 12 and he said abram come and follow me now if i went to your house in the morning knocked on the door and you came to the door whether it be sister or brother you know especially to the brothers because they're a little more hard-headed in a lot of things how would it be that i'd knock on the door and i'd say go with me well where are we going you know yourself and i'd be right along with you i wouldn't jump up okay let's go and you don't listen something happened when god contacted abraham that put him in a position that never put the rest of the people in the world he walked down through on the shores the lord jesus of the shores of galilee one day and he said peter come on paul come on they did with paul later come on because i'm doing exactly what brother branham did i was listening to him last night we waited on the tape and i sat there and i agreed i thought he said uh mark you come on do this right and i thought uh something ain't right now around here i see mark was not original to chapel paul was not an original disciple i was just talking of terminologies and using it like he used it but that didn't mean he was all so far wrong he made a human error in speech because he was a human being but isn't it something that he turned to those disciples he said come on man you get that old matthew with that tax collector boy that would be hard with it but all these ladders money anyway and yet they just lay down everything and they go walking with him well how many people along the shores of galilee that day did he stop and talk to and say come and follow me now you're saying you're making it i'm making it the truth of what i'm talking about because you got just i got this much right to say it this way as you got a right to take yours you say you're using it the wrong way why because for some reason he stopped and spoke to peter for some reason he spoke to james john for some reason what was that reason what reason was it with abraham abraham come and follow me he gives up everything he's got now the bible don't tell it that way but we're we're living in a different world we're i ain't throwing off on you women because it's the same with men today it's just a messed up world all the way around but how many of your wives would have when abraham walked in and said come on let's go back up where we're going well i don't know well i ain't going he said oh yeah you know the only reason they'd go well not because they loved abraham because it be the fact that they didn't have no husband if they didn't go with abraham so they quickly got up and went and kept their mouth shut is that an illustration without an understanding or a problem but savior just got up and went out he goes away over there and he gives her away a couple of times how many wives would like it that way but you know god wasn't looking at him giving away his wives i mean his wife he wasn't looking at all of those things god wasn't looking at that with abraham but what was he looking at we'll solve the whole case of predestination by getting an understanding of what i just said what was it there in that man called abraham that god would love when you get that and figure it out we're going to go to david and say a man after god's own heart see what are you thinking i'm thinking of one way there was something if you want to think about you come into this world with anything you know everybody in the message oh i come in the world there's seed in me there's a seed of what the prophet said it was a seed of representation from predestination now that's what he said it was and the representation from predestination will go all the way back to the foreknowledge and you're still in the book but what about those disciples they just turn look and walk off i gave the story of me that i had the opportunity i could have done a lot of things but one day when god crossed my path i had to walk i had to leave and go because i knew something was talking to me i couldn't explain it and still can't today because ain't no need of you trying to explain it's just the fact of believing it something was different about you now quote brother branham he said something about you was different all along well now what was he saying could that be what saved you could it be what abraham done back there was a very fact of salvation for the day now we're not talking about the old and new testament we're talking about salvation for the time or whatever it takes to be because abraham could not accept jesus christ as his savior because jesus christ hadn't died all right but something clicked inside of that man called abraham he said i'll go with you that's not over in the story where he meets him a lot of times and blesses him and changes his name that's when he first started that was when he was abram nothing whatsoever but yet when he walks out with god god looks back and says that's what i knew he'd take that's what i knew it'd take and he's following me what about you and me what about the first day you met god with some old preacher preaching or some other talking or grandmother talking whatever just can you think back of when that was what if that's where you started but ron said you start your eternal life right here at the altar now let me state it in this way of saying it you start your eternal life here in this world you didn't come into the world with eternal life because if you did there's no salvation involved there's nothing whatsoever you say well brother dale you're trying to say something that sounds like you're saying that we have something to do with our salvation we must accept it if we don't accept it it will do us no good amen did he make according to the bible and according to brother the prophet did god make a man and put him on the earth as a free moral agent is that true he made you a free mortal agent he can't override that but see we say but we hear the prophet the prophet said we had nothing to do with it that god saved me and i didn't have anything to do with it i know god i know i didn't have anything to do with the fact of eternal life or anything like that but we have to have a point of receiving it if you don't have the point of receiving it when are you going to get it that's right you're going to go back that way to try to find it or go that way to try to find it before knowledge means knowledge to know everything prior to when we got here you think peter and them thought about that when they walked off with the lord jesus and said well it's just predestinated i think whatever happened to abraham then made abraham just lay down everything he had and go follow a man and you know what he had no more contact with him for maybe years i don't know how long it is from 12 to 15 to 18 or whatever it doesn't make no difference if it was a week or a month or whatever he never had no contact with that man for a long time what are you trying to talk about brother dale i'm trying to talk about one thing for certain if you have eternal life today god saw you back there but he saw you the day you received it here may i quote the prophet jesus christ stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world now paraphrase it because i don't remember exactly but i know it's close but around said see there before the foundation of the world he said but that had to happen now 2000 years ago to be in reality he said in other words the fact of it happening was 2 000 years ago it wasn't 4 thousand years ago it wasn't eight thousand go back before the foundation of the world or whatever you want to do with it no what it was it was right there it was right there in the book see our salvation is written in the book so you come over into the new testament with it you should be able to see more and to realize that you have to go through see abraham didn't go through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost to try to come to the do it no he went through life as a natural man that every once in a while he'd make contact with that eternal god that melchizedek that person would come and appear to him and and and talk with him and tell him how his name is changed and all kinds of things but it never brought him to a new birth see you have to go through justification the call of god unto your life the bible speaks of the of the the what is the goodness of god calls us to repentance we must go through a sanctification a cleansing and setting aside and then we must go through the baptism of the holy ghost but what if we won't go what if we think we already have it because of this that or the other when i heard brother schweinsteiger preaching i always was eternal what i need to get eternal life when i always had eternal life now that's exactly what they're saying he said but you just don't understand eternal life i'll agree with you now because there's one thing for certain i believe the man christ jesus had within him while he was here in this world eternal life but there was only one way that could be transmitted to any man and that was through his death burial resurrection ascension and coming back on the dead pentecost then you're able to have eternal life outside of that all of our doctrines and ideas and things about what we always was that has nothing to do with it what are we now you realize we're living our predestination time we're we're in the destiny yesterday was a day today is another day we may rejoice in what we're doing one day but remember the next day we've got another day think about it was god planning on doing this or did he set back before the world and see it all by his foreknowledge if you say he was planning it but brother dale you just don't understand how we are the seed of god and he planned this and he planned that he couldn't plan it no different for anybody else and us he has to give everybody the same opportunity he had to offer it to everybody in the world or he's a respecter of person and he's a predeterminer without having a foreknowledge what about him having the foreknowledge to be able to stand here in this world and say father take me back and open up a little bit of the word and let me know how it was when me and you was together before the world paraphrasing it without you understand gives me the honor and the glory that we had before the world you know that before the world he stood as a lamb now come on folks i ain't so weak in my doctrine to understand that i don't understand one thing for certain because i've always explained it what happened with adam and eve in the garden one split second in the presence of almighty god with sin in your heart and you're dead i don't care who you are what kept adam and eve from being destroyed when sin had entered the picture in the garden was the fact that almighty god had already predetermined by his foreknowledge to be back there and he would die on the cross to take care of adam and eve what covered adam and eve was the predestination of almighty god the foreknowledge that he knew what he would do he could predetermine it yes but not preach not prearrange it he could predetermine by his foreknowledge like i've always said that's what wade was in on it one day when he was talking here i remember and he said hey daddy they really had me going because i'm a funny way of believing things i guess and i've just always been that way and i was trying to explain something one day about predestination and i said there was a girl over there that you know i could have dated and married her but if i'd have married her i'd have been a methodist preacher and he just kind of laughed about it but it took quite a while for him to understand what he's talking about i talked about this old baptist preacher that it took i think was seven eight or nine preachers to preach his funeral so you know he was a good man and i thought when i was seeing him you know and i thought well god why didn't you choose him why didn't you reveal this message to him knowing he's such a wonderful guy but see somewhere all he had to do was turn down just a little bit and that put him in the wrong side but that would have been god's foreknowledge the man by foreknowledge stood in a position before the foundation of the world but one day he came to that place you know that one of these days somebody's going to say the rapture is in motion and we're here and you know what it's going to put it that way why do you worry about anything when you why are you concerned about anything i'm concerned with one thing something happened in the man named abraham that made god stop he turned around is it abraham come on follow me he said i don't know what's going on i don't understand nothing about it but i got enough sense to know i got to follow him and see there was his predestination there was his destiny that was set before the world abraham's destiny was set before the world and there he had to meet god your destiny was set before the world ever begun whether we're predestinated to heaven or hell we are predestinated one way or the other see we make our own choice then choose you this day the bible says choose it in other words step out on i it you about it there i left that baptist church and i walked out i went to an old barbecue pit in the backyard and just sat down there squalled my heart out i said god i done messed it all up now i can't go back there so i just have to go on with you help me to understand i believe everything and everybody is predetermined but it's by for knowledge it's not picking and choosing it's by foreknowledge what causes god to put in your heart the ability to follow after him if he don't put it there you won't follow him oh i believe this message i believe everything the prophet said i believe well what about it then if there's a seed forever age there's a predestinated person to make that seed live because it's not a natural seed in the body it's a word he predestinated somebody to that place predestination looks back to foreknowledge foreknowledge then looks to destiny see i've heard people in the mess and you have to say oh i believe i was in the mind of god well so was judas is scary but you're not getting my point i'm talking about me what are you trying to do make yourself something i look at myself as being the biggest garbage can it could ever be old brother collie years ago i remember he was ministering a little bit and i got up here and told that i was the chiefest of all sinners he got up behind me on the next time he spoke and he rebuked me to high heaven he said he ain't never lived like i have and the rest of us lived i said brother callie that ain't gotta undo it cause that wasn't what i was talking about the chiefest of sinners is the one that's the closest closest to the truth judas is carrick must have been a pretty good guy because he was chosen by everybody to be the treasurer and all of the things there was no arguments no problems what are you saying i'm saying one thing what do you think about what triggered god to stop in your path and invite you to come with him when your neighbor looks like a way on a better guy and looks like and he talks about how that god has dealt with him and all kind of things i ain't going to argue with him you say no no no woman preacher come up and say god called me to preach for what if brother running and say he said i'm not going to tell her that god didn't call her he said but i will tell her it's not according to the word right but what's so odd is that that woman preacher can preach the gospel and the gift that is within her heart as a being what it is god can use that to call his children to salvation am i right that's right well i still see i can you're not looking at it right you're not looking at the anointing that's striking her instead of her personal it wasn't an anointing to abraham it was a reality hey wait a minute nobody has ever talked this away you ain't never said that about this prophet's message i've sat down and just sat there in my in this listening to him talking say never a man spake like that man because he could just bring it out so simple he'd say he predestinates by his foreknowledge somebody's foreknowledge i'm standing here tonight you're sitting where you are but god's foreknowledge but i just don't i'm just trying to get you to think about brother branham said i gave them to you last week he said god knew what abraham would do he said god knew that he would teach his children absolutely what was abraham a special guy no but there was just something about him that he loved god hebrews 11 and think of all of the great warriors of faith and how that each one of them had a connection to god in a special way what was that connection were they special people no no no don't do don't get on that line there was nothing special about them the special about abraham was he could believe god now come on he's he's called the father of faith and what is hebrews 11 by faith abraham by faith this one by faith that one what about moses what about the guy who'd come up and i don't get in your ten commandments and correct brother branham he'll tell you brother i'm gonna tell you that moses's mother taught him while he's sitting on her knee according to the ten commandments moses didn't know at least about 45 50 years old and then he happened to read the hieroglyphics on the wall now according to the prophet moses knew all of his life he was the leader but he said i can't do it but moses you're predestinated to be the great deliverer he said that may be true but he ain't told me yet he ain't made that real yet one day on the back side of a desert facing a pillar of fire brother brown said he learned more about god what was it five minutes than he had of all of his life or something i mean so many years or so and what did he learn there's been something about me this he'd be thinking and something about me has been always kind of funny he said i thought it's just mama talking you know well she was telling him you are not the son of pharaoh's daughter that's what brother brown said she was telling me and he went out and he killed an egyptian trying to help his people trying to be the deliverer but that was not the one that god was looking for too much man left too much a problem how about me and you but when he met god on the backside of the desert that man went out and that god came in he said i can't do this i can't talk he said okay you're not be like that and act that when god spoke when he said i'll just i'll just give you error and he'll do you talking so everything moses would try to come up with god to just have it ready just in the natural you know just go ahead here goes moses now how you going to do it you're going to pack up and go over to a country like russia or something like that and you're going to walk in there you and another guy you know and you're going to walk in there and you say i uh i've come to take over right and you look over and there's one two the one i like is when he says they're in the scripture you know which one was and said there's more for us than it was of them elisha well he he could only count to two but when the eyes was opened to the man when he reached his predestinated determined spot he looked around and saw angels all around that man he says ain't no worried about it we'll just take over our whole world because he knew what was there with him see church you and i have got that realized i'll bring this back a little bit more in the message of predestination you know you can just take time and read if you don't believe it by what you're prophet that you've heard him say it if i've got to read it and they say this is on to you then there's one thing for certain that is not what contacted god what contacted god if you'll listen one minute now i'm trying to explain it what contacted god whether it be moses abraham david are the disciples or the prophet of god for our day did he run like everything try to get away from his calling then something happened one day and he just said i ain't running no more i'm sorry you realize that's exactly what calls you for salvation the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance repentance is justification then you come to that and you come to the point of being sorry for your sins and you come to all of those things and and you're dealing with it in life then you come to sanctification then you come to the baptism of the holy ghost and all of those things fits in and all it is is just part of the plan of god part of his predestinated plan you understand what i'm trying to say if you have if if you've met god in the person of the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth as the bible preaches as the prophet preaches as the apostles all the people preaches it if you've met him like that then he'll come to you because he's got something to work on but if you don't know him like that then you don't know him as your savior that's why we've tried to explain it you can come through justification and come to sanctification and you know what you get new desires and new thoughts and everything at sanctification and you start loving god and his ways and wondering what's taking place in the world and the doings just don't get caught at that spot that's right go on just find you a place somewhere come on musician find you a place somewhere to get down and just say lord ever what you was there back there that caused you to stop with abraham the reason i said it and the reason i took is to do that part so you can you can say that it was through justification sanctions and baptism of the holy ghost in the new birth it caused it to pull over to god and you would follow that way abraham and him didn't have that that's why i've always preached it and always believed it abraham was a man and when god got through with him he had the father of faith he could use him sure he still had a lot of problems like i said give his wife away a couple of times all kind of thing happened in his life but yet still god never did back off because he told that king he said you better get down there and give that man back his wife and that king said look i didn't have nothing to do with all of this because they messed me up he said i don't care because that's my prophet and what you think about him ain't none of your business well he ought to be apologizing to me he said that might be right but he ain't your child he's mine and i contacted him one day and he's fathered me all these years can you say that you've followed god you're the funniest preacher ever heard because you talk about choosing and not choosing and what can it be did it go out of the book that god calling you to his salvation was the only thing that saved you because that was the blood of jesus christ you keep it simple the children god has spoken to you in your life and said come follow me just come follow me i'll take care of everything but lord i got so many problems i got this and just come follow me i'll take care of it if you don't ever think of one thing if you don't agree with me that's fine but i'll tell you this away and still remember it and that man abraham was standing down there there was a world full of people and god could have had anybody if your idea of predestination is according to truth god could have had anybody that he wanted because he created him he could have moved her path he could have moved the point but yet it wasn't there was one man one man that love god do you realize what i'm getting at do you love god are you afraid of him don't be afraid of him in all of the things of life don't be afraid of god sure we don't want to be in the presence of almighty god right because we're human beings but just remember he did call you you didn't call him but when it was finished you had to accept his call or it wouldn't be right predestination for knowledge made a reality in present tense time is where we're determined to be right here tonight this message was meant for tonight he said brother dale aren't you concerned about this listen i'm not concerned with one thing i want to serve my master i'd like for it to be said that i was his friend and the man that did not have the baptism of the holy ghost was that man and his name was abraham called the father of faith or the father of the faithful so you're saved by grace through faith that not of works lest any man should boast i've always thought about i'd like to be the man that abraham was you say you know you're getting all your thoughts it ain't mine i ain't giving my wife away two times and doing all these other things don't get it you get in a garbage can don't jump in don't expect me to get in there with you i ain't talking like that i'm talking about the truth there was some reason that god come down to that man and he stopped and then only had a servant the father of faith till they wrote nearly a whole book all of the uh hebrews 10 i mean excuse me hebrews 11 almost every time it's by faith abraham by faith abraham by this abraham by that abraham it's just constantly over and over about abraham those were the warriors of faith that had something that you and i need let's stand with us what do we got brother 25 i surrender all all to jesus i surrender all to him i freely give i will ever love and trust him in his presence daily [Music] [Music] something about the people that believe god and love him [Music] don't you think that'd be what you'd love your children you want them to love you don't you [Music] it may take a while to come to the basis for us to understand what we're talking about on predestination well you see next we've got to cover what you're predestinated unto adoption you've got a place reserved for you and god can't complete this thing without you [Music] so we've got to base it on before the world begun he would already see in his great mind everything that would ever be in the world and he could see you and see your desire see you longing for him holy spirit what do you think about him anybody has a need just come let's [Music] believe [Music] savior [Music] anderson's children and we believe it father in the name of jesus christ we send these prayer claws believe in you that by your stripes they'll say david are healed and all is well in jesus name amen i surrendered [Music] she's gonna pray on your window [Music] let's go ahead and hold it just a minute and let's get let brother boyd tell you what we're praying for because we talked about it a while ago and you know julian janet's uh cousin wendell tony is in the icu he's been out for about four weeks unconscious his vitals have been up and down and there have been a little improvement here and there but it has not awakened yet and janet's at the icu right now is the first opportunity she's had to go in there and we have some prayer claws she's going to be praying while we pray and i was asking that the elders come with us and stand and when the others come along ministers elders come ahead and just pray right now that the lord will do work i was telling i remember the testimony where brother dale just shouted out the name of randall on that person but i know by faith that by calling this up and lifting us up in prayer the same effect can happen right and i believe that right and i just want us all to pray together while janice is here right now laying hands on him let's believe it we're sending these prayer clothes okay father in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we're praying the moment that our sister is praying about these things and praying that you'd reach down and touch this person and lord that you'd take it away it's been quite a while there lord that everything's been going wrong but we believe you and we thank you that by your stripes they're already healed and we'd ask you to just make it manifest now we believe it and before the world ever begun you paid the price we love you and we thank you for being our savior we send these prayer claws in the name of jesus christ lord we love you amen amen amen can i say one more thing and also about the testimony i gave here a while back jan had another cousin that was out he was on hospice 17 days and hadn't eaten and we'd taken prayer cloths from this church and laid on him and he was out and we jeffrey and the kids and i all prayed and janet a week later we were in saturday morning in our house this gentleman her cousin comes running in the house bouncing praising the lord he said he heard everything that we had said he'd been out seven days on hospice that's no eating or food or nothing he said he didn't want to die and he'd come with two and it's just another testimony amen empower prayer amen amen amen we believe it sister freda called about her son all of you heard about it and he was doing they was doing a test or something with a treatment they were doing and they said that he was did not breathe or was dead really for 15 minutes and then he come to well i believe it i believe that i believe it as well as can be you know you say yeah but it's not well but a random said that little baby that he prayed for was die died that morning at 10 o'clock and like 11 or 12 o'clock that night or something he prayed we've seen these things happen brother doherty talked to him about it he fell out of a boat and the man had to go get the boat get it back up get it turned back over come back out and try to find where brother doherty was at in the water and he was standing there he had the rod and reel in his hand because they were fishing he had to come back and find that place and find him until he found that rod and got it picked him up yeah his boots were filled up with water is what took him down and they couldn't couldn't get back up you know he had these heavy workman's boots on and they took him to the hospital and we left we got the word from the house we left and they said how in the world y'all get down here this fast i don't really know i ain't worried about it might have broke a few laws but you know we got there as quick as we could but there he was up in the bed talking no telling how long he'd been under that water i believe it i believe it we've seen those things we've seen the sick healed the dead raised the thing i was thinking about randall the other day so he passed away just a few weeks ago or a month ago and i was thinking i thought well lord i guess it was just the point that i wasn't supposed to be over there because i thought a lot about going seeing him you know and we'd always got along but he'd tell you then he tell people we where we was at and hunting together he said wade and this man here so they prayed for me and said i was dead and i believe it but god brought him back to life i believe that too he'll do the same for all of us if we just believe it right that's right father we thank you for tonight and we pray that what we said is we've tried to make it a point lord to get us all to understand one thing that by your foreknowledge you've seen everything we'd be and where we are here tonight and everything's based on that lord it's not something for us to do and made us goody or anything else but it's what you said you said if we believe you you'd make it possible we believe you and we thank you thank you for the healing thank you for the healings of this one here tonight lord and we pray that we'll get to report and we ask you to be with freda and her son our lord that everything will be all right and we pray that you'd bless the the rest brother kern and sister luis and all the lord that you just bring them all back and make everybody be back in love with you and fellowship one with another around the word of the lord we love you and we thank you be with everybody on the way home give a safe journey we love you in jesus name amen you're just being oh to jesus
