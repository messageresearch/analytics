brother Ray's house and we go back a long way and uh me and brother Ray we matter of fact he's the one that introduce me to my wife and their family about 25 years ago and we kind of got married from

Lord has been good to us and uh you know you appreciate uh things that happened years ago and and you uh the Lord keeps us here on Earth and gives us another time another chance to get together and I

know whether any of them at all Maybe the Boy Might Be but I know the brother and his wife had been here before so always when you come here one time your visitor two times you just part of us so we say welcome back you know good to see you in a brother Brother Willie Ross's daughter that goes away back we used to come up here he would and they'd bring about 40 of them and we turned around this way and a little seat area here and Pulpit over here and they'd sing Jordan River I still love that song that's a that's a good doing but good to see him uh they get to announcements out of the way especially prior to night for brother George Quinn from Ireland he's gone to Turkey and he said that's kind of in a that area between two countries there and he said for us to please pray that the Lord would would take care of him while he's there so remember that request especially tonight oh another Aaron's little boy he's been sick vomiting and all the different doings and just keep him in mind that Lord would touch him and bring him on out of this situation called his they'll dehydrate and he they had to take him to the doctor and you know got close to having to put him in the hospital so just keep him in your prayers and a lot of others that were sick and everything remember them um brother Douglas has been sick so remember him I also remember now tomorrow on Josiah is going to be flying out to Colorado by himself so we want to pray a special prayer that everything will be all right he's going to go out there and go elk hunting so I think if he's able to fly by himself he's able to go to elk hunting too you know everything would be all right so remember that any other announcements I'm trying to remember everything we didn't take communion this last Sunday because we've got five preachers in all five was gone we've got three deacons all three was gone so we're going to try to have somebody here this weekend and and have the the communion and foot washing all right so you know doing that amen uh anything else I believe that's all that Terence has announced the um time there of the festival and just come and be with us and have a good time in the Lord for that Saturday and you know we always try to get together and we do this you know everybody comes I mean we all enjoy sitting around talking but we do a lot for the kids at that time so parents now please listen uh it's for the kids so don't wait till four o'clock and drive in with your kids when we done started it too you know you're disrespectful for your children because that's what we're trying to do is they give them some time to have fun but yet you got your you got to put yourself up and be in front of the mirrors or do something or go to Walmart or do something and hang out somewhere else you could get your kids here to where they could have a good time together all right don't just do that okay uh I think that's all we've got you know the ones that are coming the ministers will be ministering for us brother Jewel Forney will be preaching that weekend so remember him brother prakash will be preaching on Wednesday after that 29th brother uh Ernie villanuevo will be here the first Sunday in November and then brother William borlavon will be here with us for the watch not service so I think that's all of the the different ones but if you like turning your scriptures tonight turn to First Corinthians 15. and Hebrews 2. First Corinthians in Hebrews 2 would just might be much in prayer for a little Josiah there as he you know goes out and Lord take care of him all right Lord Jesus we thank you for your grace and your guidance into each one of our hearts and our lives we thank you for an opportunity to be able to gather tonight to Lord fellowship with our brothers and sisters of like faith that we can talk about you and know for a surety that you said if any two together in my name you'll be in the midst so Lord surely there's at least two here tonight that could agree somewhere and we would know you'd be here but Lord we pray that you guide us as we try to minister your word and open our eyes that we may see and let our hearts be set on you forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us Lord in Jesus name amen all right we'll go to First Corinthians 15. 24 now maybe we'll go back in another message and pick up some of the other scriptures but I've just got a thought out of this tonight that I want to get to you so let's read verse 24 through 26. then come at the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom of God even the father when he shall not put down all Rule and all authority and Power for he must Reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death all right now so then now let's go over to Hebrews 2 and we'll begin we'll read verse 5-9 but unto the Angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come wherever we speak but one in a certain place testifies saying what is man the dark mindful of him or the son of man that thou visits is him that made us him a little lower than the Angels thy Crown as him with glory and honor and just just sit over set him over the works of thy hands thou Hast put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he hath put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him now watch that he left nothing that's not put under him all right but now we see not yet all things put under him now that's a that's a hard statement for a preacher to say all is under him would look like ain't all under him you know so then we have to realize and find out what's going on all right but now we see not yet all things put under him what but we see Jesus it was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word just keep brother Quinn in your prayers this week you know in the time he said he'd be over there to the 14th I believe but just remember that now I said we we read here that in Corinthians that the The Last Enemy uh some were called and said shale it was not done away back then as we would think but yet all things were destroyed by him or conquered by him now so that's where we need to to think about this is the Bible that contrary to say that the Last Enemy is not destroyed and then turned around and say and you'd say well then Jesus Christ only destroyed certain things all right see because you'd say we don't see all things put under him but that's what I'm trying my best to get you and I to think about what are we been talking about a positive attitude that as I the statement I make almost every service that anyone in the Bible or anyone in our day or whatever are down through the dispensation of the Gospel that ever amounted to anything in God was people that had a positive attitude all right now that's not mind over matter you know it's not just that form of positive attitude it's a positive attitude when God speaks to you and tells you what's going to take place and then you stand there and you see it taking place all right and see in doing that then we can still we can follow it to a point that uh I believe that there's a group of people in the end time I believe every age I'll get to it a little bit Sunday to speak about it some maybe the Lord willing on the overcomer but I believe every age has had the reported part of the word you know in the time whether it would be Old Testament New Testament or whatever the people has had a portion of the word for each age in time and they've lived that that's why I'm talking about a positive attitude they they had something that was more than just a letter of the word as I illustrate about Luke Martin Luther no telling how many times he read that the just shall live by faith he may have made great speeches about it maybe you know sermons about it and all but see one day something happened when the man something happened he got a positive attitude then he turned the world upside down right the disciples in the upper room they had the word but they didn't have a positive attitude that's why Peter could say over there later you know he said I was on the mountain with the Lord Jesus but he said I have a more sure word or we have a more sure word of Prophecy all right something made alive and that's what I've tried since I come into the message and and everything talking today about it that I've tried to have a positive attitude to look at things as our day I love to read about other people you know I mean I've read of Smith Wigglesworth and what 16 times or something like that that the dead was raised in the man's Ministry I forgot exactly the amount but you know I love to read about that I love to read about the things that the great ones like brother random would speak of Saint Martin and he said that there was nobody as great as Saint Martin he said except the Lord Jesus Christ you know all right and she said you know see they had a positive attitude but they were positive because it had been revealed to them the day they were living all right now when it's revealed to you and I not letters on a page I was asked about like when I preached in 1969 about the son of man and uh I believed it then and I was asked the question well uh you know when did it become alive to you well really I'm honest to say it I'm truthful when I first heard this message I saw things come alive to me that I'd always wondered about you know that don't make me no different you should have to you should be able to say that that this message brought to light things that you had wondered about all of your life and and studied on and and thought about and prayed about all right and see by that then I've always had been a positive attitude about the point but I want you to see the day and the hour that we're living all right that's why we spent so much time on this series to to bring everything to a basis that no matter how far you go backward they're dependent upon you and I no matter how far you go forward and any others are the Fifield Jews the 144 000 foolish virgins you know they're all still dependent on you and I and that was the statement I was making Sunday about that see nobody anywhere ever has went through what the Lord Jesus did but we must do it he went through death burial Resurrection change of the body and sailed all through the hour in a Rapture all right but we even the foolish virgins can't do it the 144 000 that will receive the Holy Ghost Hereafter we leave but it still will not make them Sons and Daughters of God it'll make them servants to the bride we know that all right you see nobody can do that with you and I all right then you see the whole scope everything before us as their day is come and gone and there was somebody to live in that day all right but see to you and I we must come to the place to where we see who we are and what we're doing here and the prophet said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for he said nothing will be able to stand in their way well see you can read that to people I'm not throwing off on people I just honest it coming down through time I remember you know wrote around him he'd get up and he'd say I take every spirit in this building under my control well you know I believe it but uh a brother got up one time and he said I take every spirit in this building under my control I didn't believe him I'm just talking I didn't believe him you know why God I've seen things about even though things about him that wasn't under control well I'm just honest but see he was making a statement right I can go in the Bible and read you the Bible and say that is thus saith the Lord by his stripes you are healed I don't have to have a prophet to say it I don't have to have God to come down and say it I can read it for myself but until that's quickened to you amen come on that's right until it's quickened to me it's only a quote a mighty Goodwin that's good but only a quote that's right but when it comes off the pages is that the way the prophet said it said this Bible could be questioned as long as it's laying on the pages of the book he said but when it comes off of those pages it could never be questioned anymore why because it's alive this word has got to be made Alive by somebody well somebody's going to stand here in the last days and look death in the eye and life at it the prophet would say brush it off your sleeves you know and just not even be worried about it well now we're going to have to go through some of these things so we're not going to spend that much time in it tonight but my point is if we don't know what death is how are we going to know when it's destroyed well that's easy brother Dale and be destroyed when we walk out of here well then nobody will have to tell me right just to Gail if you walk out of here tonight nobody don't have to tell you you ain't gonna die you know what I mean you go excited up through the hour as a young person nobody don't have to preach your sermon that's right that's right all right but see the prophet said that we must confess that we're healed before we can before he can heal us because he's making intercession from our confession all right so then if I don't say I'm Healed then he can't heal me whose fault is it then well now I I just really don't I believe I'm Healed I believe I'm Healed but I I just don't believe it heals my sickness well there's death we'll get to those things but what I want us to deal with tonight is the one thing because as I read we know the Bible says The Last Enemy to be destroyed is death all right you know plain language now that don't need a light bulb to turn on that means death is not destroyed in some way something's wrong all right now we're sensible enough reasonable enough to think about that we're getting older and that we're dying that shouldn't need a great big light bulb turned on and a great Revelation well I just got a revelation I'm dying I don't want that revelation do you understand me if I got a revelation I'm dying you know what I'm going to die no I'm not going to be changed I'm going to die all right but think about it now see you would say but I thought Jesus Christ destroyed death at Calvary and that's 100 correct but we know for a certainty that we're still dying that's a certainty well what it is we need to get this all to where where we can just get it out of our mind you know we'll go to the what is it Christian sciences and different things like that you know you know get a great positive attitude that we're not sick I was just reading today where the prophet of God said when you're sick you're sick which you know what most people don't say you're sick cause you bring it up he said you're already sick well yeah we get it all into a great thing that we think is a great Supernatural thought that we're just going to think we're not sick but that ain't gonna help no just go ahead and thank you you're not gonna get no older is that going to solve the problem how do you well I was 74 but I'm not no older how many well it's been five years but I'm still 74. now that ain't even common sense right let alone Revelation but we thank those those things are in that order all right but now let's take some things that said and I like to do this I like to take something that's said over here something that said over here and and by on you know by allowing the Holy Spirit to bring it together and you'll see a beautiful picture and that way you don't have to understand everything that away and everything that away but you just understand what you understand all right because that's the way the Lord deals with us all right go ahead and pull up number I was telling them Sunday we I was going to tell them it wasn't their fault Sunday about all of the problems with it with the quotes I gave them the mornings quotes and thought I gave them the afternoon quotes at one time and come find out I didn't do it so they were back there trying to find out what I was talking about and they finally got back together but I told them at night I said we're going to start right here all right go ahead and pull up number one which is taken from Hebrews chapter 2. in Jeffersonville Indiana 1957 8 25 in the evening now look at what your Prophet says and listen we're on the eighth verse then shall he put then has he put all things into subjection under his feet pharah he put all things in subjection under his feet he left nothing that is not under his feet but now we see not all things put under him that's death we don't see death yet because we're still dying we see death not verse but we see Jesus all right now we don't see death destroyed not saying it wasn't destroyed but we don't see it as the point of being destroyed because we're talking about the physical part all right now by the new birth the soul has already been made eternal all right and can never die all right we know that's true right that's the purpose of the new birth or the impartation of the Life of Christ you know to put us to a place that we can stand here and be able to say what he says and understand it because he and and we read in Hebrews to an eight and we read it there you know coming down to it he has put all things in subjection on his feet for in that he put that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him all right he left nothing that is not put under him all right but then the same man finishes the sentence but now we see not yet all things put under him event all right now is Paul that confused or is he correct so he goes on and he says but we see Jesus what is he saying we see he who conquered death all right we see that spiritual death has been destroyed all right we know physical death was destroyed in Jesus Christ he proved he had power over death because even before his death burial and Resurrection the dead was raised all right but the same man that was raised Lazarus went back and died again point then of Salvation was to just bring him back alive not to make him Eternal and even in Soul because Jesus Christ hadn't died yet all right but he could return him back to the position that he once lived in and bring him alive but the man died again see all right see showing that death was not done away with but we see Jesus we see the one who conquered death amen amen now as far as God is concerned it's over with right all right now I hope you're following me and followed the point then and then on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came it made the soul of that 120 near per room and in the 3000 later it made it eternal so death was annihilated for the soul if we accept it right if we receive it it would have done away for everybody death for the soul was not done away forever the opportunity for everybody to be saved was made but it wasn't applied to everybody it was only applied to a group of people right but see then that way we have eternal life death has been destroyed by the new birth all right and I'll read to you at a while where the Prophet says why should we be afraid of it why should we be afraid of it well I'm getting older well so what that means I'm one more day closer to being there huh but you see what we do a lot of times we get enough salvation maybe you call it until we don't want to go to hell you know so we'll kind of hold on to that you know that we don't want to go to hell but we don't move over in enough of it to be able to see and set us free and thereby can't bring us to a positive attitude if we don't do that all right but Jesus Christ destroyed death now listen to my point and you if you don't you totally misunderstand me he destroyed death his death destroyed death it annihilated death right but yet it wasn't applied to mankind in every form it was only applied to the soul of man because that would be the way it would have to come down huh and see then in the end time it would come to a marvelous situation you remember how we kept on the other week talking about how that he went to the father's strong spirit and brother Ron said that he was not on here strong Revelations 5 4 there he's not on his throne his throne is the millennium son of David but he's on the father's Throne which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the prophet said through seven Church ages all right your new birth gave eternal life to the soul of mankind but it didn't give eternal life to the body see it didn't come to the body all right so then we can make a total conclusion of the entire matter and say what Jesus Christ destroyed death but to some part of that has not been applied to you and I yet because we're still dying but yet the new birth right so you see why Paul emphatically States but we see Jesus we see the opportunity now come in this message and I started studying the prophet and listening to him you know how it is and even now today so I'm in the message still doing you know or we're going to get a new body you know that's old denominational Doctrine we're going to get a new body well why would we get a new body right I mean what's the purpose of it right and where are you going to get it from all right see then we think well you know no no no no no brother Dale we gonna get a new body grandma taught me that grandpa taught me that so-and-sort yeah and you know what they put in US unbelief in God's word because God's word never talked about getting a new body never know her you see the one thing brother random would say would be enough just one point he said if if you drop a book you pick up something else that's not bringing that back he said then if if you lay that down see and it don't come back up you got something different and with Jesus being raised with nail prints in his hands three amen is enough to realize we don't get a new body amen we get this body made new right all right that's the thing that's not been applied it's not been applied to this man out here come on and how wonderful to understand this end time message and see that down Through the Ages mankind has wondered about things talked about things but then we had a prophet to come and tell us and we are to return to the original word see then we can talk about going off in Rapture because really there's no need I've told you years ago there's no need to talk about a Rapture you talk about a resurrection first because according to my Bible the dead in Christ's going to rise first then we which are alive and remain be changed and go away so where it shouldn't even be concerned with Rapture at the moment we should be concerned with Resurrection all right then Resurrection would have to put a connecting link to those that are to be raised that are in the grave all right and see that connecting link is a revealed word so I believe what Martin Luther talked I believe that Joshua live by faith I believe what Wesley taught is sanctification I believe the Pentecostals the restoration of the gifts I believe in that right because that's part of the word all right and see then we should go on through it but now coming down to this then let's think about it for a minute he was made a little lower than the angels to be able to taste death you say well my God can't die I know all that quote's all right go ahead but also know that he acted departed death when he climbed upon the cross and died that's the unveiling of God little run said he acted departed death one because that life was released out of that body and the body died all right all right see then we thank God for the truth to be able to set it in order but what is going to bring to pass the changes of these bodies right all right now the resurrection ain't going to change you because if you're alive it's not Resurrection that's right that's right all right it might be Resurrection from our old denominational beliefs yeah but not a physical Resurrection but I think we need to comprehend and understand that why he would go on to say we don't see all these things but we see Jesus see then my hopes my all is based on whether he raised whether he raised because without his resurrection there's no good of any of us talking about a resurrection rats or anything now in doing that then let's think about tonight the point hold it it's physical death mortality life which moral means death doomed all right and this is this is called mortal it's death doomed all right going to a place to be Immortal or eternal all right now in doing that then if we don't see first Jesus and what he went through and what he done then how can we see what we're to do all right see he went through death burial Resurrection he conquered death right right all right but he only applied it to the Soul on the death Pentecost see the end time message is the part to apply it to the body that's why the mystery was never known by mankind down through the ages of what was going on but then here comes a little old man walking out there and probably maybe the first or second sermon he preaches and you know 47 I think was the first to have on the record part of it and shortly thereafter wrote around starts talking about son of man you know well nobody didn't even know what Son of God was they had it all messed up as trinitarianism but he starts talking about son of man well because it's going to have to come to that position of understanding that because son of man is word made flesh so when a man is not Son of God dispensation Son of God dispensation is a baptism of the Holy Ghost in our hearts and lives by the new birth son of man comes down to dealing with the word made flesh now why would it have to deal with the word made flesh because the flesh is the problem the flesh is the part that's not that the Redemption has not been applied unto him why are you dying that's right If That Ain't Enough oh I know you're really not dying well go comb your hair over on the other side and part it some way and met a boy at school he he you know this is back now I'm talking about 1955. and this boy lost a lot of hair well he he went down you know and they hadn't got into a lot of this um sprig plant never what you call it they do now but you know back then so he goes to this people and oh they they show him what to do and he come back to school and he looked like he had to hit her you know I mean not totally but look better than it did all it was is give him a bunch of moose or what you call it and stuff you know and thickened it up in that form and then just pushed it around where it wouldn't show the bald spots I laughed and told him I said it didn't do you no good he went back all we want to did all this at now it ain't gonna do us no good until the reality comes all right so now let's think about him did Jesus Christ pay the price in full right all right if he paid the price in full then we're not asking him to climb up on the cross and die again why because we finished it when he said on Calvary it is finished that was it right all right now but yet we've got to look into the word to see that for certainty and follow that line that it's these bodies that is the end time it's these bodies the Redemption of the body right right has got to come if not you're just like we wasn't organized religion well what did it matter can't go to a smoker a drangler because it don't matter I'm going to get me a new body well all right but if we can see what Jesus done and see the part that was applied and see that they were some part of that that was not applied but will be applied in the end time you will value this message more than you ever thought of in your life if you ever really see this message you remember what we'd bring out the other day we're there in in Timothy that life and immortality is brought to light through the gospel all right you can see there is a hope me was that what job said is there a hope for man I see the tree he comes back I see this come back but he said man lays down he gives up the ghosts he's gone but one day he seen he'd raise him then he had a better understanding didn't he listen to what your Prophet has to cover and then think about it go ahead with number three brother this is from the message the Great and Mighty conqueror preaching 57. 4 21. what was it okay hurry up come on up yes that's the last part come back up what was it corruption right here we got it come back up I just didn't underline some of this roll it all back up a little the other way okay now we got it what was it corruption knew its micro the soul knew its master and that Great and Mighty conqueror proved there that he was he has the power of death death and hell and the grave now he proved that all right sure it Thrills our heart you talk about hey dish pans and blowing horns the world ought to be in a jubilee this morning like it never has been the screams and the shouts of his people because this is the Memorial Day that when he conquered The Last Enemy and set we kept his free now he conquered The Last Enemy but Paul in Corinthians says The Last Enemy is not destroyed right right so now it's got to be something different from what we're thinking because so then you're it's the way you apply it he conquered death he's not going to die again he conquered it all right if we can see that we'll see one of these days out of to do away with death all right he conquered it remember he conquered The Last Enemy but yet when he speaks back through his Prophet messenger Paul he said the lies the enemy is not destroyed Paul when that probably come to him for him to speak he probably his head's probably spun around and around him he says now Lord something's wrong here it may have been a while between the Hebrews and the Corinthians in the writings of the letters but eventually it got there he said we don't see everything in a way but we see Jesus you come to that point of understanding so that's what me and you need to do but look what he says now from the restoration of the Bride tree number four preaching 62. 422 paragraph 48. he had triumphed over sickness diseases and all kinds of devils and Powers then death laid before him the Great and Last Enemy and on Easter morning he proved he was God he rose from even the light Rose from Evil And The Last Enemy could not hold him the grave gave him up hell had to give him him forth heaven received him he conquered it he conquered death amen all right but then we would go back and read things like this go ahead to number five it's just so bad that's taken from God talked to Moses it's so bad when poor little children have in suffering have to suffer like that won't it be a wonderful day when that last enemy is put under his feet now he just said it was totally annihilated now he's saying so you know what he sounds like Paul don't he right don't he sound like Paul is Paul speaking that the last enemy's not destroyed and then he turns around and said but we see everything put under him but then it strikes him and he said but now wait a minute there's something I'll put under him yet but said we see Jesus see we see Jesus that life's enemy when that last enemy is put under his feet which what he goes on now to the faith of Abraham number six some glorious day that Last Enemy I have which is death will be trapped right under the feet as with the Conqueror we shall March through the city what is The Last Enemy to be destroyed death words are dying at in flesh could a born-again person doesn't die even an unborn again person doesn't die like annihilating right even they must go to a place and wait but look what he goes on to say look at number seven the mighty conqueror he said father these are those that believed on you I've conquered both death hell in the grave now that's his raising up when he was going up you know Everlasting Gates and all the time and he said father these are those that believed on you I've conquered both death hell in the grave and I can hear the father say Ed sit on my throne here son until I made The Last Enemy thy footstool and Jesus signed upon the throne and to right hand of God and said he's there tonight now what's he talking about then the life enemy to be to be made his footstool look at the next one let's read it as the eagle stirth his death number eight all right all right now we can pray for people God can call now the Bible said that he's the same yesterday today and forever is that right and if he's the same he has to be the same as principle the same in power the only thing is his body is sitting at the right hand of God we all believe that he's sitting at the right hand of God on God strong that's not his strong he's coming back to Reign on his strong it's the Throne of David because we know that's where the promise was made he said take it strong he's sitting on God's Throne waiting till the last enemy is made his footstool he will return someday bring the precious Souls with him to take on immortality to live in a glorified body live through the Millennium leave forever all right right if it's if it's not that death is still raining why does it have to be a resurrection that should solve a lot of problems if we're going to get a new one there's no relationship to this well why is there Resurrection I mean you mean all down through the ages one day there's going to be the resurrection then they're going to throw that away and get them a new one that only makes sense I hope you listen to that you know sometimes the Lord does speak through dumb donkeys you know but see The Last Enemy is natural physical death that's what we're doing death is taking you and I let's read this last one then we'll get off this possessing the gates of his Innings number nine a Royal King when he come born of a virgin he conquered every enemy even to death so death itself cannot scare the Seed of Abraham we have the promise that will inherit the earth and shall return again in a more glorious way in the glorified body after The Last Enemy is placed under foot of the only and last child of God that shall come into the kingdom now if you want to know when the resurrection is coming he just told you he just told you in the resurrection gonna come after the last minute is placed under foot not for everybody the only and lifestyle of God you remember the prophet and all other seals and the thing when the lamb leaves The Mercy Seat he comes down here redemption's over hey that's why everybody thought it was over with when he preached the seals he didn't say that here is the answer to it when the last child he said comes in and reads you see a book and see if that's not what he's saying when the last one comes in he said he'll raise and come all right but I want you to think about it you said but what about this last enemy that we call death because I said now I'm get to point to you before we go on with what I want to say I can cut your head off but I can't kill you right because even a sinner lives on somewhere and a Christian lives on somewhere so death that we better be concerned about is this part of dying right because if you're con if you are a born-again Christian why would you be concerned with death because it's already annihilated to you because he annihilated it and he come and lived in you to prove it's over here right so the flesh is what we're dealing with well I said then if if you can't see it then maybe it's been 40 something years of me studying that's made it that way but to see this message comes to deal with this man they had to baptism with the Holy Ghost each age had the new birth and they even the disciples had from here down call the face of the fathers well yet they were still dying and I told you Paul then would say a nice enemy to be destroyed is death but then when he gets over in Thessalonians he said the Lord still descend from heaven with a shout voice of an archangel and trumpet stay you see church it's this day this bride in the end time is going to take that death away from Satan now he's already made the way he's already proved it can be done right what do we be worried about I've got a few quotes I want to read you here in just a minute you know death is my helper wait a minute death is my helper all right let's get on over the message a little all right but what about this great Apostle Paul that come down to the last part of his road and was laying there in a jail cell in Iraq's an outstanding statement he's fixing to get his head cut off that's when he said death where's your sting grave where's your victory because you know what he saw Jesus now come on see we don't read like we used to read in the in the denomination that I used to read where Paul was talking about you know the different things and it looked like you know that it would be that he was expecting the Lord to come right then you know in other words I've said this today and tomorrow he's going to be here that's what we talked but brother random said that God was trying to get out of the Mind through the Apostle Paul that the Rapture and the things was coming right then because he said there must be a falling away first we thought right opposite right but he said he's trying to get it out of the mind to the people that he was coming right then Paul could look down 2000 years and see the falling away the biggest falling away is the people of this message but now think about it let's read what he'd actually said the waiver of random see we read it you know Dan where are you staying great let's read it the way he said it all right go ahead brothers and let's pick up number 11. we've dropped off a few of these quotes but we'll even Saul when he had when he had to get rid of his armor now remember this is Paul calling it Saul you know all right he took off the Ecclesia classical armor he did like David did but when Saul come to the end of the road he said I fought a good fight that was The Last Enemy to conquer he said yeah but wait a minute Paul wasn't you're not listening see Paul saw death destroyed I'm talking about here he wasn't just talking about himself he saw it done here that's what your prophet's saying come on read it he said I fought a good fight that was The Last Enemy to conquer come on I fought a good fight I finished my course I kept the faith henceforth there's laid up for me a crown that the Lord the righteous judge will give me at that day said not only me but all them who love his appearing oh death said here's what Dad said but I'll get you in a few minutes and the grave said I'll mold you out under you know without rotten you he said oh death where's your sting grave where's your victory I know I'm laying here in this Roman dungeon Bound in Chains my wrists and hands and I I got 39 stripes across my back I'm here with tears scalding my eyes until I can't see no more see my naps with my natural eye but I can see a crown of righteousness laid up our chunder my ankles are worn out I fell off so much from the old molded bread they throw it in here and the Rats has thrown over me and the spiders and things don't sound like a conqueror well I'm weak but he could stand in the face of death and say where is your Steam grave where is your victory with chains shaking on his hands Hallelujah that's what we need Grave where's your Victory the grave said I'll rotten you Paul he said but thanks be to God I've already got the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ he may be right then realize what he had spoke of in Thessalonians when he said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven saw death destroyed but yet he was still dying somebody is going to see death destroyed and you know what it's going to come to pass because you see it wasn't applied back there to do away with the natural dying it was applied to the soul of mankind to give him a new birth to give him eternal life in his soul and that he lived through that through seven Church ages for 2000 years and God would send down a prophet that could take all of those scriptures and bring them together it's like what a red diary how perfect could a man write than what was written to her man of the horrible situation but the demand says death where's he staying grave where's your victory you know what they come along was that the one or was it Peter which one was it where the boy was concerned he said you know you're dying he said what they called his name wouldn't it Peter he said here I am or maybe Paul won you see when we're afraid of death that's our problem that's our problem when we're afraid of death let's read what your Prophet said and let's see if it's the attitude now let's see if your Prophet comes to the point of speaking in different wordings but yet the same point that he said Paul stood there and said in the most horrible situation but yet look what he could say death where's you sting grave where's your Victory I'm not afraid of you you see when we're afraid of death it's done got us who wouldn't Arnold Von Winkler that took all those fears and grabbed them and run them into his belly and said this day I die for Switzerland you got past being afraid of dying come on look at the next one the way of a true prophet we have a true prophet of God 62. that's number 12. there ain't no bother no more death is nothing we got it it's ours oh no no it's the devils argue with the prophet no problem it can't control me I control it right the doctors will tell you to eat pork 24 hours a day and you're going to eventually die with high blood pressure so you can control that you know how don't eat the pork right see we spend a lot of times on natural things but I want you to get the point it can't control me I control it how through him who made me an overcomer because I've already overcome death how did I do it by Believing on him you said well that's only speaking about death for the soul well I would wait a little bit death is in sin unbelief I'm not an unbeliever I'm a Believer I've raised from that thing resurrected it's the earnest of all my complete physical spiritual Resurrection meaning everything right everything yes sir you get it congregation says amen so we do have death under our control through Jesus Christ who has overcome death hail Grace sickness and sorrow everything else triumphed overall he said we don't have to buckle down to death all right death is going to take us it took the prophet right it's going to take us until something happens and that something happens to somebody who God can speak to and they believe it and they get away from their unbelief look what he says on how can I overcome number 13. but remember greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world you must realize that the Holy Spirit that's in that's in you has already overcome this thing and he's in you and you can overcome by him that's exactly sensible exactly the way the scripture is written overcoming he said I got a very look at the next one a couple more beer through without money or without price all right once I was a sinner Bound in sin with heartaches dreading death but today death is my victory now the Lord don't he Hallelujah it would only bring me in the presence of him I love that I can look upon his face he changed the thing by an operation he taken my heart and made it anew I know something happened to me death is my victory I like what old brother Carol said he said he said it sure because it sounded like him nobody said brother Carol you about 80 or something like that and he said yep and said I'm either going by the grave I'm going up one pretty quick all right but you see if we're afraid of dying now we're not dumb stupid idiots maybe a little on the idiot side but not dumb we're not going to go out here and lay down in the middle of the road and say God's not going to let me die don't tempt him right be sensible all right look at the next one the flashing red lights of his coming paragraph 168. then I'll come on down until I can't get out of much here if you read he's got you know like I'm gonna be a grand ball Grant Grandpa I'm going to be there I'm getting old then one morning the fog will come into the room emotion across the border to death to come get me he can only take me by the hand and lead me across to my master every little man talk like that he is not my slave driver I am not his slave he is my slave Christ conquered death for me and only one thing he can do is pull me into the presence of my maker when this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved you ever heard a man talk like that sounds like Paul don't it I come down and I get so old I can't do nothing I'm just sitting down in the chair you know I said a fog comes in the room and said emotion death come on you know that God cannot Satan cannot get you until God is through with you would you agree with that so why are we afraid of it I mean what are you afraid of now we're not stupid we're not taking a gun blow our head I'll get on over here quicker no no but do you think when brother Brown put that gun to his head if that gun had went off you know what he went right in the presence of God mid right oh of course we're still in the day where we believe that if you take your own life you lost veteran says no what would have happened had the bullets went off oh we know it couldn't happen amen I know it couldn't happen neither could death get into the man that would sit all set there until I get so old he said I'll have to call it and tell it to come on what are you afraid of if you're afraid of dying now come on we're sensible there was something about death that we don't understand it makes the human mortal react and everything else but yet why would we be afraid of it I'm afraid of dying cause you're not right right now you see the point I've been driving that that Paul could say the life enemy to be destroyed is death and we don't see death yet put under him because he's sitting on the throne at the time and he's got a raise to come this way for it to be totally annihilated then it'll only be annihilated for the bride that's right death is not I'm not his slave but brother Dale you're not afraid of dying I wish I was certain about a lot of things that I am about to have you know that I'm not worried you know who I live for you I live from my family I live for you is that Paul's understanding better for me to go on I want to go on but said no got to stay here got a job to do but if you're afraid of dying you've got problems you need in the Altar and get your salvation straight that's why I've tried my best to tell you about your children don't teach your children about a dirty mean God that hates them but don't tell them about a God that loves them so much he let them get by with anything either tell them the truth about it one more conflict between God and Satan preach 62. 5 31. but just think brother there isn't nothing he's talked about facing the setting of The Sun you know but your thing brother there isn't nothing but what we have we got love we got joy we got peace we got life we got we possess death that's right the Bible says we do we possess death it belongs to us we don't belong to it it belongs to us say what you going to do with death you know what are you going to do with that just like Paul said when he come knocking at the door said have you come to escort me across the river oh no no death is out there oh don't come in here where I'm at Paul said you've come to escort me across the river say it God hooked death to a buggy and the only thing it can do is pull you in the presence of God that's all can't die they just hitched up dead to a buggy and the only thing it do is pull you right up in the presence of God it's just a mascot to come to pull you across the river that's all it is and there's nothing going to bother us anymore Paul said when death come rolling down through this the time for him he said oh death where is your sting said well I'm going to take you out to the Grave he said then grave where is your Victory I possess you too then he turned around said thanks be to God who gives us a victory through our Lord Jesus Christ see the life's enemy is not destroyed yet but it was destroyed by Jesus Christ it wasn't applied back there and hasn't been applied to the ages all right there were people in brother branham's Ministry that were raised from the dead right now are you listening you know what everyone died or have died I guess because maybe he might have been in a child or something that we don't know the exact age of that when it was in Switzerland but they died proving that God had conquered death he brought him back to life but showing that death was still taking its toll they went by the grave well we're afraid come on out the fake plane we ain't gonna do a dumb thing and walk out there and sit down on the track and wait on the train to come by right we're not going to be like that but why should we worry the doctor comes in and says you're dying I will remind you that when a little girl just recently was put in the hospital in Atlanta she was in the Intensive Care Unit wasn't expecting her to live the mother and father left the child and come to the Bible study when a lot of you won't come that plain enough but yet you're in the message and yet you're ready for the change are we doing something in Bible study that's contrary to the word of God well I just don't have the time you got time for everything else don't tell me you're gonna miss that doctor's appointment Monday morning or Monday evening that he tells you to be there don't tell me you're going to miss that work that you're supposed to be there at eight o'clock Monday morning sorry but is it truth sister Trudy for 20 something years drove five hours four year four hours ago four hours to come here from from above Charlotte four hours to get to church more dedicated than 98 of what's in here take it till the day I was tired tired of playing it's time to be plain she'll be a witness against you that can't make it brother Dale you don't understand 20 years ago you wouldn't have said you don't understand because you would have been here yeah but I'm sick we pray for the sick and I got back trouble today she could have stayed at home and he under playing Church you say well you're just getting upset and getting picky do what you want to I don't care what I'm talking about death being destroyed that's not going to be destroyed by you laying at home in the bed and goofing off you can take that or leave it that's why the biggest portion of the people of this message I said this 30 something years ago are going to die and go by the grave and I did not mean it then and do not mean it now as a dechristianizing form I mean it as God's honest truth because most of the people are not going to be sincere enough to want to serve God is to open your big mouth before God not me you just opened it before God because you're telling him what you're going to do sorry I love you and love is correct even tells the truth and from the love of a heart of a man that spent 40 something years here trying to get you to see one thing this bride has got to destroy death there's not enough time to raise up another generation to do it in he said well you're telling God he can't do it no I'm telling that God ain't going to do it see death is taking you and I because death is unbelief we'll get down to that there's only one thing of death that's unbelief yeah but I believe everything forsake not the assembling of yourselves together as a manner of may I paraphrase that as a matter of unbelievers you say that's not what that said well I could probably remember when you told me that's what that said I know it I got too good of a memory I'm sorry Alzheimer's ain't hit me yet Old-Timers has but Alzheimer's name I can still remember the day when a lot of you were on fire but your fire is dwindling down your Fire's dwindling it's time to rekindle it sorry you go home call each other and talk all night long about how bad there for the daily is help yourself but when it's all finished and you start to hang up I hope one of you remembers to say did he tell the truth if you don't call me and I'll tell you I'll get to telephone companies call you and remind you that it's the truth you see the death that you and I facing the worst one of all is the unbelief Eve didn't believe God would keep his word what about now come on brothers think about it what about it we've got a need some prayer claws so we'll go ahead and everybody can stand and then we'll remind me to do it we could Brothers come up we'll pray over this and we need some more prayer claws put in the in the fight think on these things we might not see everything but we see Jesus the mighty conqueror but you know what he's got to come here and you and I to be able to take us there now how many times have you heard that statement how many times father I just thank you for tonight and I pray that what I've said is went into the hearts of each and every individual here including myself to realize that we see Jesus we see death destroyed by you Lord we see we see it still taking us because of our unbelief because of not believing that you've conquered everything oh yeah we believe it by words we believe it by forms of beliefs but we do we believe it by reality I believe all of our hearts would be changed in a different way thank you if we come to a reality and father maybe it's going to take that because you said through your Prophet that the bride does better under persecution well if that's what it takes Lord because see we're not afraid of dying I'm more afraid of living than I am dying Lord because in the living we get up and do a lot of mistakes and problems but if we just die out to ourselves you can take over we love you and we thank you just bless each one now you said in your word that you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from our destructions so we thank you for it thank you for healing us thank you for delivering us thank you for delivering everybody in the building from any sicknesses whatsoever is there we believe you and we thank you because we know that much of death is destroyed and it's so powerful until it'll conquer these human beings that we are we love you in Jesus name what do we got brother 174 in a red boat anybody have a knee the Alders now let us have a little talk with Jesus God we believe you and we thank you for it in Jesus name sometimes my path see we've seen a dead race we've seen Satan lose to reach down and touch and take away this pain we condemned that pain in the name of Jesus Christ on the basis of your words waiting on somebody to see that Jesus delivered and surviving by now when you feel a little prayer will turn no a little fire is thank you think about it just a little talk with Jesus Troublesome times are here filling men's hearts with fear Freedom we all hold dear now's that stage humble your heart to God Saves them a chasting rod seek the way pilgrims Christians away we won't even Jesus coming soon we thank you very fast my leg's been hurting me we go to doctors and we take things and do he's a real good friend of ours we talk about the Lord we've had some great conversations I've explained to him a little about brother Branham what we believe he talks to my wife all the time he's the one you know that put the prayer cloth up over his door because their business was kind of going down well that's kind of an odd way to pray but we prayed here and we took a prayer claw to put it over his door and you know their business went skyrocketed High well how God works things out that's none of our business maybe he sent them from other doctors around you know it's up to him but I went in the other day and we got to talking just a little bit he said I'm going to teach a class on family you know life and things and said you know what I'm going to take it from there in the scripture and said you know they're in Malachi 4. said where it says it and we're going to turn the hearts or the fathers to the children he said he'd turn the hearts to the children to the fathers and uh he said I want to talk to the children and I won't talk to the fathers and I want them to see that we can help each other you know well I didn't scream out loud you're wrong simply called he knew the scripture because he's quoting it to me he said there John did he come in the spirit of Elijah and said he uh in Luke 1 said he said he turned the hearts to the fathers to the children was either her and opened it up you know message have you ever considered what that's meaning I said John turn the hearts of the Old Testament Saints to the New Testament message of Jesus Christ he pointed to Calvary pointed to Christ he turned the people you know the hearts but I said then the Lord Jesus I said when he come they're in Luke because he done quoted that where Jesus you know read only part of the scripture and I said because the other part was pertaining to his second coming so he wasn't fulfilling that part and he said yeah I said well then what's going to happen to turn them children if he turned the hearts of the fathers to Salvation I said could John turn him because it said there in John Luke you know said and it goes right on he turned the hearts of the children and in terms of the Disobedience to this and they've been taught that he turned them this way and then he turned them right back you know and I said no I said if he turned them to the New Testament message and then he turned them back like it's taught by mankind I said let me turn them back under the law that's right I said well then uh something's got to happen to turn those hearts of the children back to the original faith of the Apostles he said that gives me something to think about he said I never thought about that you know what I didn't go on that length with him I walked out of the office shook his hand went on home well I don't mean it's wrong because it ain't right but you know what if my back hadn't been hurting and my leg I wouldn't have been there and I would have never got to talk to him about that I walked out of the parking lot I said Thank You Jesus thank you for my leg hurting me because I was able to witness to someone about your truth what do you think I worry about it hurting me but you know what I believe it's going to be gone so I don't worry about it see that's why we get afraid the doctor says I've got so and so well you got it as long as you believe you got it but when you turn around and say well doc you're right I got every symptom I got everything but my stripes I'm Healed I believe God does things in mysterious ways his wonders to perform you might be sick sometimes to try to for somebody else well well brother Dale did you say you wasn't going to pray for me no no no no no I said Lord now that's been done I said Lord you took care of it I got a witness now help us lag let's see death is not my conqueror he's my victory that I'll be in the presence of God in a Split Second yeah but I'm afraid of dying the owners open you need to be praying if you're afraid of dying because all you're wanting to do is escape hell did you really know and understand where the brothers comes we're going to pray over these prayer cloth come on brother brother collie brother the volunteerence Aaron I don't know because see we believe in this we believe in sending out practical laws we can stand here and give witness to whatever to the things that's happened over the times of us with little old prayer clause I liked it one time and I still got one in my billfold that we took the top off of this Pulpit this this material and we cut it up and give it away well I like that because there's been a lot of things to people out there has never been up here you're to walk up here and look sometime there's a row of kids and people and parents and adults and and everything all around here and when we're preaching you think I ain't looking at them sometimes and we even start going down the side over here we'll probably take this up again one day and give it away too but we pray so let's just pray put it right here and all of the brothers we'll all gather together if you want to put it on your fingers and do then we will all pray over this and then we'll cut it up this is the from handkerchief that was left over from the youth banquet in Alabama in 2006 and so we you know we use them for that to make prayer claws out of it you know and I believe it don't you we were like Brother Richard Wilson was telling that time that they gave that lady in prison a prayer cloth and she sleep every night this other lady and I couldn't sleep she talked her into letting her borrow it for one night she borrowed it and the lady that borrowed the prayer clock went to sleep and the lady that didn't have the prayer cloth stayed awake all night so we can give a lot of testimonies about these prayer claws so let's just pray over them all right father in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we know the truth of what it is it was to be aprons taken Norton but yet we're not just taking an apron and piece of material off of our clothes or something that would be good Lord but yet we've warned this there are two Services now here laying on the platform and warning that we believe you Lord we believe that you'll anoint this with your anointing presence and that father you will be the one that will make it manifest we believe you and we thank you Father for all of the things that you've done with these prayer clause and we believe it we love you and we thank you we commit it to you now Lord in Jesus name amen and amen and amen amen we believe it because it's a finished product and we even let and I'm going to probably let them do it again we we even let the kids cut up the prayer clause you know let them have a part to do with it maybe next time we're going to make them a little bigger because they cut me up a bunch one time that's too small but they didn't know that but it will instruct them to do all right father we thank you for tonight and we pray that you would just go home with everybody take care of everybody on the highway give a safe journey we pray you'd bless our brother and sister here as you come to be with us tonight and just let them understand Lord your love and your grace and that we're trying our best to just be one thing and that's what you want us to be and we thank you for all things forgive our sins lead us guide us and take care of the people on the way home in Jesus name amen you're dismissed troubles will soon be your happy people when we meet on care rising up in the sky telling this world goodbye Adventures foreign
