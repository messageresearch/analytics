========================================

foreign he's worthy of me foreign holy holy amen is no chance Hallelujah did you see everybody in the house of the Lord factoring your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Ephesians 1 and 1st Peter 1 1 Ephesians 1 First Peter 1 we want to thank everybody again for all that you've done for the uh doing with the the fellowship meeting the fixing of the food and everything it was really great and had a good time and we just really really thank you for all you've done and all of the the work and the things like that because that was the I guess the largest fellowship meeting that we probably had that one in Gainesville might have been bigger years ago but I don't really know but it was upwards of at least 160 people so that was really really good I really appreciate all of you doing the work because you were it was marvelous you took care of everything and and got it all done and we appreciate it amen Ephesians 1 and First Peter 1 I hope you enjoyed really horny for the weekend have a good time in fellowship and all the way there amen father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us we thank you for the day the hour that we're living the time that we have upon Earth and we pray that you would just know it open truly our eyes of understanding that we may see you as you are revealed to us through Thy word Lord forgive our sins because we want to be clean and and to be there the word it Lord you can come to us when you desire to and we know that lord it's not on our goodness it brings you but it's because you promised it and that Lord is our the greatest thing we could think of that our Lord and savior would promise to come and dwell not only just with us but in us and manifest yourself we thank you we commit it all to you now in Jesus name amen visions one verse 3. blessed be the garden father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings we're at now in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved amen now let's go to first Peter 1 verse 22 and 23. seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfying that means why hot in other words the best you can do clean it up and everything unfined love of the Brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not a corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever it may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word yeah we have been on this on adoption you know this is message number seven but it's adoption in three stages we're trying to to get a better understanding and and you know that's the the hour I believe that we're here that this is the time I don't believe it's the prophet gave it in the the message manifested sons of God he said where my brother and where my sister's outside of this time was it ever promised right for the manifestation of the sons and daughters you know of the Living God to be made manifest all right see and we know that Romans tells us that the whole world is groaning waiting for you and I amen all right so you say well let's just get on with it well we can't do it until God comes down to Quicken the time it can't be done but we're trying to to get an understanding to where you know that we're just not like the world and uh and I don't mean the natural world I'm talking about the religious world of the misunderstanding and doing like that but we try to get into the word and believe the word and just move on in the word because that's all all I know to do see this is the hour this is the time right not if they wasn't manifested Sons and Daughters of God listen get the point and read it and listen to the prophet they were manifested Sons and Daughters for their age if I don't understand what I'm saying for their age all right see the book of Acts they were Sons and Daughters of God they they had the faith of the father but they did not have the headstone to come and and bring the message to them you know and that but still they were for their day and their hour they were God's manifestation upon the Earth amen see we're just trying to get into it to bring it for this age amen all right and recognize the international main thing I've been trying to get see is to recognize in your day in this message now we recognize the prophet we recognize the message of the hour we recognize those things but do we recognize our day amen and I've been over that and over that that the prophet said you know that there was a word for every age all right it's the word that comes predestinated eternally it's not the person right it's the word right now what we've got to do in this day though for it to wind up is what wind up for that person and that word to unite together right all right now that's what I believe will bring about a Rapture a change of things is when you know you and I become the word that you know and you can say well we we know this doctrine of one God we know the doctrine knowing a Doctrine and knowing the god of that message amen is two different things amen all right so you can you can know the quotes you can know you know all the things but if it's not revealed right right and if there's one thing one thing now listen this is what I've been trying to get you to see if there's just one word to be revealed the Rapture can't come right now because that's what's holding off the Rapture is not just time and elements in people and whatever it's the revealing of God's word all right all right so then we shouldn't be concerned about you know the point of we've been here all of this time we should be concerned with the fact that whether or not has God been able to reveal his word have we turned down the Revelation right you know because it didn't come our way our thoughts I was just reading uh back there a while ago on some things brother random was saying that everybody's got it figured out their way that's it right there amen all right and I would say and wouldn't back off of it probably here in the building you would find it's basically everybody's got a little different thought about what things are right or to expect or what to be amen you know may we we may have the overall view as one thing too but yet we we would have our different ways of looking at things there's no problem as long as we don't turn down the revealed word right right turning down the letter of the word is one thing but turning down the word when it's revealed right now that's another thing right see when it's made revealed unto his arm but see we've been talking about manifestation as I said most people think manifestation is signs and wonders you know Miracles taking place and and all that and that's wonderful that is manifestation that that's something the word there means that but the prophet of God what did he say he said what is manifestation a manifested sons of God preached 1965-18 he said what is manifestation he said make it known right amen amen make it known that's right she didn't I've tried my best to get you to see one thing that signs follow them that believe amen we don't follow signs if we did we'd better get out of here and go somewhere else because there's probably a lot more on some of these other churches going on than what would happen here tonight maybe right see because that's just the way that it's being done and to me now I I don't have any problems with that it wouldn't change me none whatsoever if if ever Church in the world was having signs and wonders and we didn't have any at all that's not going to change me about what I believe right amen I want you to know that up front what I believe I stand on because what else can you stand on signs and wonders but Iran's done told you he said even the gifts and the things that was in his life was not to be done that away that's right we were supposed to believe the word without having to have signs and wonders but God is so gracious rich in Mercy that he would give the signs and wonders to try to attract our attention to what right to the word right I'm like I've told you over and over then people to say well you trust brother random while he's he's the discernments and the things like that he's prayed receipt but sit down watch him when he starts preaching you know well now isn't that something right yeah sure right I mean to me that's so carnal until I I can't conceive the idea of that but if we see signs and wonders are we supposed to go after the signs and wonder are we supposed to go after the word and expect signs and wonders to follow the word which way is it that's right amen see that's all I've ever been right see people say well brother Dale you don't believe in signs and wonders you're you're messed up in your mentality it's the best way for me to say because I believe in signs and wonders more than you I can tell talk to you about it if you want to talk about it hey because I believe it but I believe the word first that's the way it comes to me it's got to come work first and then signs will follow all right and see then that then is what if we make him known by the preaching of the Gospel by talking to people fellowshipping you know out in the world talking to people and you witnessing the people you know and things like that see you're making your father known right amen maybe you never thought of it like that until you know you started thinking about manifestation but that's what it is you're making him known right well he's going to make you known that's right he's going to make you known but my prayer is always this Lord open your word right I've tried my best for all these 40 years coming up you know pretty quick to make him known even here in this building you know to make him known all right I believe that he's made us known amen you said well I'd like to when I would too but I'm satisfied with what he's doing amen I'll get down to that in a minute you know I'm doing to see what's the great deception in the last days all right but just follow with me now we'll find it see we covered Jesus said now what is manifestation make it known right we make him known he might trust no all right all right now it's not that he's making us known and then we make him no no that's reverse we must make him known and then he can make us know amen we've got to be secondary in in the point to work that we are departure that way see signs follow them that believe that night we don't have to have signs and wonders to believe God's word do you all right I mean do you do you've got a house signs and wonders before you can believe what God Said now you show me in the Bible any sign that ever happened before the word was spoken amen me I mean you know show me in the Bible he said well Abraham right but I'm glad you said that because God spoke to him out of his word his signs and wonders took place right right see it's always been the word first and then signs following the word right check it by dude I I can't check the signs and Things by other signs that's right well we got more signs than you got that's about like it was when Josh and them was playing he was playing in the band up there in their their football team wasn't too good but he said there's one thing about it our band will beat your band any day let's just don't get into the wrong thing with it signs follow them that believe all right but yet to be able to see we must recognize our day and its message see we we take the point we recognize the prophet as I said a moment ago we recognize the message but do we recognize that if we if we recognize the message and the the prophet then we've got to see ourselves because he didn't can't speak of himself right he come to speak of a word born bride amen man he didn't say he was the foolish so that God had bodilies I gave you that doesn't it but he said the bride with me right all right see and even saying that to God he is not complete without me and you amen that's right we see we we declare the message and we declare to the messenger thank God we believe it but what about the message this brought see Martin Luther he couldn't he couldn't if he'd have been the only one that would protesting the Catholic Church while they'd have blowed him off and said forget it right right it wouldn't have been concerned but when the message he began to bring begin to develop in the hearts and the people right right that's right and they started protesting it wasn't just him protesting it right it's when the message come forward right man the people begin to protest the Catholic church then they got concerned they started losing converts in a hurry right he would have never run around what did he say he said when that bride begins to say I and my father are one that's right and these other things he said he said the shark will pull away that's right all right well why don't we get over recognizing who we are amen my brother tell you what do you mean I'm in the bride I'm in the bride that's not recognizing it you know that's not the the point I'm talking about recognizing I'm talking about recognizing yourself in the word right find the message for this day now what did we preach that months and months ago that the Book of Revelation shows the bride that's right never shows Jesus Christ by himself always with his pride or someone like the Jews or whatever he's not shown by himself right but now listen but there's a word for each age and that word must be made manifest why because it's a predestinated seed amen the word is predestinated eternally well whether you and I like it or not we ain't gonna change what this is right all right see the way we've done and the reason we're here 40 something years after the prophets went off the scene it's why because that we haven't recognized ourselves right and seen what's going on right man no no listen we'll get down to it in just in a second let's go ahead and just cover it brother Branham said you believe him God in Simplicity 1963 317. God will hide himself in something so simple that'll cause the wise to miss it a million miles and then turn right back around in that some simple thing in the Simplicity of his way of working and reveal himself right out again right knowledge he said I thought it maybe take a text on this you know before we get to the teaching of the great teaching of the Seven Seals many miss him by the way he reveals himself now here's the Great mix up it's always been here's the greatest mix-up of all things you say denominationalism you say this is them that is and we're afraid of this we're afraid of that now here's what I'm afraid of all right by the way he reveals himself now man has their own ideas of what God ought to be and what God is going to do and as I have made the old statement many times that man Still Remains man that's right man is always giving God praise for what he did do and always looking forward to what he will do and ignoring what he's doing right man now there's the greatest denominational mix-up that's ever been right to the people today you know with my time if we're back there they don't even know that's exactly scripture because when it was facing you know they said if we'd have been back there that's man and that's his ways to do it all right listen he goes on to say that's the way they miss it they look back and see what a great thing he'd done but that's failed to see what a simple thing he used to do it with and then they look forward and see a great thing coming that's going to happen and nine times out of ten now listen to it that's pretty good average right nine times out of ten right right it's already happening right around them and it's so simple that they don't see it right that's right now I want to make sure to identify Christ of all ages 64 401 he said man is always praising God for what he done always looking forward for what he will do and ignoring what he's doing right amen amen now there's the thing Fredo organize religion no right denominationalism no right we ought to be already above all of that all right amen yes sir if you're concerned about whether or not you can be deceived by doctrines that are flying around the land and I'm telling you up front you're all ready to see it that's right of course that's the deception why can't you trust the holy spirit amen the only problem is if you have it right amen right because it's never allowed me to go into those things right and yet I studied the doctrines that they would bring right because I wanted to see what they were talking about exactly right amen I studied them but once I be once I seen what it was then forget it I mean it didn't take me six months I didn't do it that way I was just seeing what they were saying didn't drop it and forget it because once I seen it was not in the word yeah right and everyone that I ever watched like that it was always pointing man watch this and you'll see it it's always pointing forward huh because the ones that started the doctrines didn't look backward now here's the biggest portion of the group of the message people are Looking Backward to what brother random done what he done and what took place all right now but these doctrines they don't look back to brother Branham right right because they don't base it on what he said oh yeah they take quote quote quote quote but don't take it all so they're looking forward in other words you know what they're looking for the two Soul people you know they they had it down and they caught it you got to come to them you got to come to them they tell you what it is they'll tell you where the changes are at the seventh under virtue people they'll tell you whether you got it or not you got to come to them well that's that future right see so the great thing is to either look you're either Looking Backward are you looking forward and failing to see what's going on yo but I don't see much going on well then open your eyes what would you see if you were heading down the the the ramp going to work so I understand oh Gloria hallelujah we're going to die today Lord I don't think so I'm sorry now when it got down where the line was at it might have struck because in the lines a lot of times wouldn't even hurt them and they had to probe the line to get them to come after them right but just get my point it wasn't Glory we're gonna die no notice but see people were not recognizing what's taking place well if y'all had what y'all believe we'd have more signs and wonders how can God tutor his children right that's the whole point we need rain now Pray For Rain that's right man all right but if it's a monsoon season we don't need rain we need for it to stop so get your story correct oh see looking back look what God done through the prophet I'm looking forward look what one of these days now one of these days is going to be a great thing well now let me just put it this way and I'll be as blunt as I can so you listening looking back will not bring you to adoption looking forward will not bring you to adoption right amen that's right you'll only come there by recognizing your day in this message recognizing where we're at right now amen you will never do it by looking forward there is things to come amen We Believe amen there have been things took place amen we believe in that received the greatest day that's ever been in the world now I thought your Prophet taught this time I thought the Bible said that the whole world is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God that's it amen I thought the prophet taught that in how many messages how many are there to hear ye him right let alone all the others were in it yeah that he was talking about that the whole world is waiting for the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of the Living God the world's not waiting on it to come to an end all right the world's not waiting on great earthquakes and stuff like that the world's waiting to see manifested Sons and Daughters of God they saw it for a little time there in the prophet because there he would stand and speak and he speak to squirrels and you know into existence he would speak to the world and he would speak to the Hornets and things like that they saw their master the trees the people the animals they saw their Master for a moment but he said what you've seen in part yep that's right you'll see in his fullness but if we don't know what to look for all right that's my whole point now here this is all that's on my mind for for tonight all right that all I've ever watched of people in the Rapture form of speaking it or whether they was talking about adoption or whatever it's it's they're waiting for something to happen one of these days we're going to speak the word one of these days we're gonna do this it's always in the future well you know that's that's easy to do isn't it you know I could always say you know you talk to people about they talk to you I'll talk to somebody and they'll start telling you oh we're here in the end time we're in the end of the world oh it's bad isn't it you start giving really scriptures real quick and then they'll say oh but now wait just a minute now where nobody knows the days or the hour see they start back pedaling when they were the ones bringing it to you right right but you see Church people are looking at adoption as a man of transfiguration experience all right I know I preached it to you your new birth is not your adoption your adoption will be amount of transfiguration experience right all right now we believe that because that's where the Prophet called it but he also taught it in three stages and so did Paul and Romans all right he taught it like Paul is as an identification there on the River Jordan then a matter of transfiguration coming to recognition and then go on to the change all right now let me put it this way and you think about it the biggest portion of Greta Reynolds message would not be dealing with what has been like the biggest portion of his message is not dealing with what will be now you understand what I said he brought those things all right but the biggest portion to me of the message is trying to point to where you and I are at to get us to see who we are amen amen that to me is the most important thing because it could ever be thought of yeah see and the biggest denominational mix-up is to look back and say look what they had and look forward one of these days we're gonna get it and failing to see what's going on right you know your Prophet said it like this one day he said the same Holy Ghost that justified the Lutheran sanctify the men just baptized the Pentecostal Now set in order to come into the Lord you know what the same Holy Ghost it was back there that caused those people to walk into a lion's den he said it's the same Holy Ghost you live daily in the basis the word that you can overcome by that Holy Spirit that's right we want to make something big out of this and something big over here instead of seeing what's going on right but but Brother David yeah I'm looking forward to many things there's many things your Prophet spoke of that I look forward to even to drastic horrible things that he said California going under Etc earthquakes in diverse places but see we're seeing it work now oh man he said after a series of earthquakes California would go under me why but see our point is always California Glory we're here 77. Glory we're here we're here we're still here but instead of dying in 77 or as a man told me he planted trees where you get that Spirit off of him I didn't know that planting trees would get a spirit off of you I thought repenting did right right I know what the man said he said I I had the idea we were going out here now I'm playing trees where they'd grow up and watch them grow but we don't need that but now listen what is going on now is the most important thing that has ever been amen what has been going on since the prophet left the scene is the most important thing in the Bible because it's what the Bible is looking for it's the finality right it's the climax it's the last act to the play it's whatever you want to bring up to talk about it's the end of all things all right but she always looking back are looking forward and not seeing what's going on now to me if instead is the worst denominational mix-up that's ever been but you see Church I want to think about your adoption and I told you now listen I'll say it again where are you going to understand me I know what the prophet said your new birth is not your adoption your adoption is a man of transfiguration experience which is really that even is not the adoption that is the change of the body would bring you to the completion right right all right but there must be a matter of transfiguration experience in the bride all right see your new birth is the spirit of adoption right Romans 8 14. that's right the spirit of adoption see then we've been in the process of adoption amen that's right I'll try my best to get you to see that because if the Holy Ghost is our tutor and that's what the prophet said it was and according to the Bible it is Anna then if that be true then something that's been going on Amen right for 40 something years right right something had been going on in those that would walk in the light because you've never heard me get negative about the hour that we're living in that's right that's right amen of course your brother told me one time he said oh you're just a good old Madness see because a good old Baptist he just kind of looks at everything plain blunt and he just says well don't tell you huh whatever it is it is here and I still believe what I did and uh mice to the 60s about adoption I told him then they said one day we're going to speak the word I said you've got to have it before you can speak it well of course we've got it we got the books and the tape oh my well we had the Bible yes I didn't do something with that right man yeah you see right see don't miss what's been going on don't fail to see that see people you know what I gave you the quotes about around saying Pentecostal people that's it when they got the new bird that was all of it they got it that's good Baptist just moved up a step they say I just spoke tongue that's bad just said we got everything when we believed well we spent a lot of time saying that ain't right and we spend a lot of time staying with them Pentecostal tonight but what about the Pentecostals of this message and that don't mean you got to be a Pentecostal denomination and come out of it to be one or whatever it ain't even talking about I'm talking about what your Prophet was talking about when he gave I gave you the quote I'm talking about people that think look what was back there yep look what was back there and we got it because we believe it foreign you ever seen it no well you don't know where it's leaning right or left right you understand what I try to make a point with that me brother dick's been on the Brooklyn Bridge he could tell me all about the Brooklyn Bridge but I don't know a thing about the Brooklyn Bridge I don't know whether it's going north south east or west or how it turned to you God I've never been there seen it but because they're saying what somebody else says now does that ring a bell that no man can call Jesus a Christ by what somebody else says is that scripture that's right must have your own experience all right but you see we say we've got the new birth brother Dale we got everything no we didn't I told you I talked to two men one of them said he hadn't got everything when he believed in other words he said when I was born again I was adopted I was everything the other one on the other side of the table said well I'm sorry to tell you I don't agree with you he said because you ain't got nothing yet I saw my brothers they forgive me for being this and I'm just somewhere right in between you two and I was I was kind of setting they were in my life yeah I said I just don't work out in between here because you know I believe that I have the new birth right right exactly like it they didn't like it but then you brought around and made the quote I said brother and said he met people with the Holy Ghost 50 years they got it before he come on see he said exactly like the book of Acts both of them said they didn't believe that but they said they couldn't understand it but they didn't want to sit and listen to me explain there was a difference in the upper room experience in the 3000 later it only heard one actually right but you know what they all got the new birth amen that's right but you see all right that's one side of it I only got the new brother we got everything the other side of it one of these days it's coming it's coming one of his face all right now that's the denominational mix-up right and the most dangerous one it could be time now let's get into what we're talking about we talk about adoption as a person that was born in the family and according to Galatians about four then he's no different than a servant because he's a child right right and we talk of that as Galatians brought it that he's under 2 until the time appointed all right now what I think most people are saying if I'm saying what you're saying then I'm sorry I'm just trying my best to say it okay the word it'll catch you and me but see spirited our tutor we had to quote quote quote but how many have you ever thought about until I started bringing it out I'm just saying I don't understand what you want to do but but how many of you thought about that the Holy Spirit and the father is a self-sane spirit amen and then the tutor can't be a different Holy Ghost right from the father that's dwelling within you amen had you put it together that way she said that's what we're far that's our job okay the Lord speaks and we just go on and do and try our best to help right all right then it's the Holy Spirit and the father is the self-sane spirit if not then Jesus had two daddies right I'm quoting brother random man huh but you see that it would have to be the Holy Spirit would have to be the spirit of the father coming in and dwelling the natural story is not like that the natural story The Father hires somebody else to do the tutoring right that's just the story and I'm sure that every one of which one was it um Joseph's standing on Jacob every one of them kids was probably adopted it's when a child gets you at a certain age then they have this thing that happens and they bring them out and they they're coming into manhood right and it's not a play thing Wade brought it out here one time I really enjoyed it because I really didn't know all about those things myself and he was bringing out how that that child has to know all of them do certain things of the Bible that he had to know to be able to talk and tell about it or he wasn't brought to the position right all right it wasn't just a little kid and he grows up and he gets up pretty good size and he's able to shoot a ball you know oh that's my boy but you know what now if we change the story and get it correct the natural story they hired somebody else to tutor the spiritual story is the father coming and living in you in the form of the baptism of the Holy Spirit to make sure that we come out to the correct that's right amen ciao amen right right see the natural story The Natural story you can only use a natural story as a time right right as I said probably uh Jacob adopted every one of them but Joseph was the one of his heart that got the coat of many colors right but every one of them probably went through their their day in their time of being brought into the family right because that was the natural story all right but you see it's not somebody it's not God hiring somebody else to raise his children in the spiritual Kingdom God comes down himself to dwell in us right Amos to bring us his nature and his feelings that's right that's it right there right amen listen what I'm saying your adoption is going on that's why I'm trying to bring it in three stages you see recognition when you're born into the family by the new birth then growth development down through the statue of a perfect man into things and then one day the change of the body but it's really not even to that because to show you that it stops into the manifestation the Bible doesn't say that the Bible says to understand the Redemption of the Bible that's not the change in the body is not the not the adoption they still understand the diet the to how it's going to take place right and then it's got to take place if we understand how the people amen that's right but you see the the tutor in the natural he's going out making sure he's supplying everything the child needs and he's going back every once in a while he says father he's he's doing good he's acting like you you know he's doing pretty good but see in this situation the holy spirit is reporting to the father all that Unitarianism well then if you realize the Holy Spirit the father is the Same Spirit you're not that's right you're back to the truth my point is God is not waiting for you and I to come down there to amount of transfiguration to be able to show us that's a part that is in the story he's doing that now because we're making him known right that's what I've been doing for 40 years and making my father known what happens he didn't have to do anything because he knows what I'm saying true I'm never asked him to give a sign I've asked him about something to show me but not a sign of whether the word was right or not I'm asking natural or something spiritual in the extent but I've never asked him to give me a sign to tell me the word was right what do I need that for I got his word I want him to reveal it to me right yeah I've got the letter of the word this prophet's message is the letter of the word amen that's why I've been so long in all these years of taking the things like Daniel 70 weeks and the seals and and all those things and spending lengthy times on them right to try to make my father known thank you well he's giving us enough signs and wonders but you see I'm Not Looking Back and I'm not looking forward to press again I I hate to be like a guy you know that fictitional story but he got a newspaper a day ahead of time oh he could bet on anything he could buy anything and he could make money just rolling like everything but one day he read the obituary and found out he died to die before the day before that's not a joke it's just to tell you right I'm Not Looking Back I'm not looking forward I don't play the lotteries my thing that's right my brother said you know play the lottery make sure you pay your tithe don't bring time I won't take times out of a or or out of a lottery sometime that's right don't bring it to me I don't want him why because it's not good money and I've been blown about the things that are and I've expressed it to you about it somebody gives you something that's not it but when you take a gamble is when you're putting down something on your own that's right amen it ain't a gamble when somebody walks up to you and hands you something that gives you trash my gambling this when you put down the money and trying to bet on it or or making you know that's gambling we don't agree with it that's right but now listen the father has been tutoring his children from birth whereas in the natural Story the tutor was tutoring the children but you know the father wasn't sitting back I mean do you what do you think the story is just let me let me Express the natural story of what most people seem like in their mind about the they can explain the tutor they can explain the razor and everything it's just like that that the father he he gets the baby you know and and the baby now we're just going a little bit you know maybe make it three four years old before you ever start much you know but all at once the father he just hands the baby over to the tutor and then he leaves the country is that what you think a doctor is that what you think that that the Cooter and the things was doing don't you realize that that child and that's why the scripture says yeah it is no different than a servant and the servants eat at the master's table you mean the tutor feeds the baby the tutor raised it he gives it see right you say wait what do you make that Carnival for because of the carnality of her mind you mean the child is not allowed to go to the table don't eat with a family and they're supplying everything he has need of who the father you don't throw the baby out he's there with the child hip and raise it even in the natural right right well what about in the spiritual when the spirit of the very tutor himself the very God himself can come back and dwell in you and I to be able to start us up the statue of a perfect man and then that doesn't make no difference because when we're born again it don't matter what age you are you know you could be born again at 10 or you could be born again at in a hundred what would be the difference it's still a baby in Christ Desiring to sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby as Peter said what being born again let's see Paul get Peter gave two of them I wrote it down somewhere in the notes I'll find it in a minute but it's being born again growing in Grace and knowledge all right the father is not gone somewhere else so that's what everybody's saying the father goes off the scene the tutor raises the child that's all I've ever heard let's see to me in this spiritual application the father is coming on the scene in the child that's what he did in Jesus wouldn't it right amen he came on receiving so much in Jesus until Jesus was almighty God Amen right amen right right well I can't we believe what he's done for us right right he give us a new bird amen amen then he starts feeding us sure maybe sometimes milk yeah sure that's right but yet growing in that the word that the father is supplying everything that we have to go but you know he gives it to us when he wants to because he's a good father right brother Gary he's a good father he didn't catch that because he's still asleep punching Hey Brother Gary I'm using you as an example okay see it's not that the father's gone that's right the father is not feeding him amen all the way through your spiritual journey amen from the new birth until the day the Redemption of the body will come it's the father inside of you and I preparing us what do you do with your children that's it it's gonna be about 12 years old you throwing the keys and don't try to go pay the car and drive it no no what do you do three or four or five years old what hey that's the break that's the guess this is the starting room here's the gears you surely don't do like uh Papa used to do Matthew either because he got an old lawnmower and Matthew you know he could do anything in the world I've seen him he'd Drive forwards right down through the middle of the floor I ain't kidding you right down through the carpet he would nail boards to the middle of the floor and I'll dish that turned around let's go get him the nails you know it is here but take it out on the lawnmower and he cranked that lawnmower up and ate a little Old Wagon thing on the back of it and we'll pop out shut back on that wagon he just turned Matthew loose he run over the flowers he run over the neighbors he run over to catch the dogs he run over everything in the world but still he don't wait you start telling your children right you're telling them table manners right of course that's generally gone now but table manners manners you know to to do you know to be polite I like the six kids like Zachary you know what yeah sure no yes sir no sir well actually kids do like that you know that women get offended at me when I'll say yes ma'am I'm not your mama no but I'm recognizing you as a lady right baby yes ma'am what the nature of the father is being instilled right all the way through your Christian Journey the statue of a perfect man is showing that you don't just start off down here and say well I jumped up here you know because then that's what people say now people say this is a doctrine that I'm right here where it said brotherly kindness lady will see an age because that's the age I was born there what does it matter about that right you've got to get the new birth you got to start we're all through our Christian Journey has been a growth development right yeah I've caught you over and over it's doing revealing of the word and you're sitting listening sometimes right and you're hearing somebody I may be preaching on the seals and I'm really just going through the shield right down Atlanta and you're sitting there and God revealed something to you about one God right imagine divorce something click all right right yes sir not even what I'm talking about right you know what I've done my job I probably said all I'm supposed to do is break this fail Satan has it over your eyes where God can speak straight to you yeah that's right amen amen do you understand what I'm talking about we're looking out there to a Transfiguration right now oh any days you take us out there and oh he'll speak the word but you don't take a child out and give them the keys to the car right but when they get 10 11 12 years old you start letting them do little things right I learned to travel in the backyard in a big old backyard I just take my brother's car and just pull up back another back on the back first time I decided to drive up there and it's that little building with a little house right straight across where you come out of the driveway from the house that used to be a store I drove up there and there's a great big old Road during a great big parking there and a great big road that goes over to the house and I pull in there and I get what I'm going and I'm back out and I look see if there's anything coming I back out I wound up the ditch over on the other side in the garden call my place to turn around in my back clean out of the road over on the other side into the ditch I didn't know how to drive oh boy I got my license I mean we'll forget that every time I go through there I think about Admiral 50 Mercury and I went around this courage going from my house toward Danny over there and I went around this curve and I remember boy I you know I was sitting at the truck he's holding up things the time I'd see it now and I just by the grace of God I finally made it around because I didn't want to go I knew better to turn real quick and I didn't turn enough and I'm going around the curve and I'm off the road by the time I finish the curve up you know right Mary you think you know all about it no to you and Hobie yeah when you get to be about 60 you'll learn how to drive then you're too old to know anything about it but you understand now the point I'm trying to make everybody get the point I'm trying to make a point right and my point is one thing why don't look back we don't look forward I thought we believe that I am men ever present for eternity amen I thought that's what the definition the prophet gave of I am see there's no yesterday with tomorrow and with God and there's no tomorrow everything's present tense he's not over there he's right here living with us and I spend the father down to our life from a debate today we were a birth as a baby in the spiritual Kingdom we started our adoption the tutor came on the scene and he started raising us he's been doing that for some of us for 40 years just a little slow if it don't matter power in the tortoise prove that right amen now that's highest you are so continually just grinding used to call her and he said that's the way he preached he said it's like a cat in the ground I just don't when it's tall you said that's impossible you never didn't know what he was saying that's not impossible because once that tongue touches that grinding stone a couple of grains of that rhinestones coming off oh yeah the tongue is being cut and sure you ain't gonna lick it again for a while but it's just like the prophet always said about it if you pray about something he said maybe a few grains will move today yep but he said there's something taking place why can't we see in our Christian Journey there's something been taking place oh we're waiting on something out there or no I'm happy where I'm at I'm satisfied see we start out on our simple Journey with a cougar training this simple thing and then he just keeps training us that's right see Peter calls it being born again and then he calls it growing in grace and the knowledge of Our Lord the whole Bible oh he's not pointing back and it's not pointing future heard some things in the Bible that would face and there are some things that'll be future yes sir because it's the word of God but the main thing God wants us to see is where we're at right now you're not going to get any fake on what's coming right you get more faith off of what has already been than you do off of what's coming right but you see I want to live right where I'm at present tense gospel see watch Ben I wrote it like this he wants Ben for some of us 40 years in our tutoring in her child training because God wants to raise his children to be his children that's right and he may have to tell us and Hope brother said I know from God when I asked him he said it's just as much as it would be he told me yes right that's right now how many of us do we asked for something to be removed from us and it's not immediately gone was it going from Paul about his eyesight that's right but you see what he was talking about this side but why not use all of it it wasn't going about his eyesight but he said to the Lord your grace is sufficient this year is on me for a reason we should see we can take every sickness and try to make it something that's on there for a reason you know let's don't do everything okay see Jesus didn't even preach the gospel until he was 30 29 and a half years old is that true but it's somewhere around 13 14 years old he was straightening out the Pharisees he didn't wait till he got dire to just start talking about the word you understand he was in a growth development being a child learning he obedience through the things that he suffered and being made perfect he become what see we must in our training sometimes it's just a little at the time wouldn't it be wonderful to live in a place to where every time you open the Bible God had just quickened it to you or you take a put a tape on or you you read a message or something and you just you just turn it on and got it just quickened it right there wouldn't that be a wonderful place no I'd raise a bunch of see if it's bombs you say no no well okay but you see sometimes we read the same thing over and over and over and all at once one day he speaks to us well you know that that's your father he knows you got need of something so he quickened that it may be as I said one God when the preacher is preaching on the seals or something you understand what my point is it comes true with what now how does our growth development come through the opening of the word amen right through the opening of the word well you know who the problem is there's a bunch of preachers that ain't been getting into the word and preaching the word that's the reason you're looking back the reason you're looking forward because they can't see what's going on right the prophet made a statement one day he said you can't understand the seals until you understand Daniel 70 weeks did he say that amen well you know who wants to know about Daniel 70 weeks that's right see everybody knows you're all about to see you don't know about Daniel said you leave but I didn't make the statement the prophet did yep he said you can't understand well he was wrong here and he was wrong there and he wouldn't you know and if you can correct him then you must be God what do you understand my poem something is going on the greatest thing that could ever be in the world is the trial the child training of a child up to bring it to an adulthood and the father's right there with you just like I said the natural father he's sitting right at that table and the tutor he may not even see him but he's looking and he says I see some good things about tutor's going to do a good job okay but you know what your Prophet said too he said that tutor would have to come up and said the Holy Spirit would have to say sometimes that your children are not acting right the defussing and arguing and complaining and griping he said they're not acting right father said okay now here's one that's hard sometimes for us to understand but around him and referring to it one day he said the tutor said father that I've made your children sick you want to quote for these right sure you said they just raised their hands and said Thank You Lord and it says by Stripes I'm Healed whatever's going on my father's got a reason for this let me find a reason and get out of it amen see we can quote a lot of things like the prophet of saying says father your daughters cutting a her and wearing clothes and painting her face is not correct that's where we want to do then we want to justify something we want to turn around and say Well they're not born again they're not children of God your Prophet said Do Well you better change your attitude he said they're yours they're my children man it got drunk right sure what's his name Smith or something Ramsey in the Hebrew series got him some beer and went out and sat down got drunk a preacher God took him off to see he said he couldn't let his child marry his name we don't look at them things we've got a set of standards in our own minds that we call the word of God and we look at others as those standards if they don't meet them they're out but we failed to quote what brought around would say your sons and daughters are doing wrong but we want to save the devil's children the ones doing wrong think on these things take on these things my whole point we've been in the most wonderful thing that could ever be is to those that know what's been going on that's right for 40 years I preached it to you I preached child training tutorship for 40 years trying to get you and me to see something's going on don't look back don't look forward the things that are past you can do nothing about it the future will come because God promised it right she said he won't send a headstone on your marriage right he said he'll send it because he promised it but you know what he wants us to do it's just it's like that two to train us maybe tutors such a father tutor assistant inside teacher we don't have an outside teacher it's an inside teacher right we don't have an outside tutor we do that in a natural world but we have an inside tutor which is the Holy Spirit let him raise us okay number two nine number 290 I surrender all amen in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ only because you're worship okay we're going through everything brilliant turtle s I'm trying my best to get to see one thing we've been going through a journey in fact there's a Christian Journey right you may think nothing's going on but what would it be when we get over there and those that are back behind us and the ones waiting on us are saying yep if you hadn't went through that trials and troubles and tests in fact you'd have never come to the right place that's right that's enough look what you went through but my point is one thing we don't think we're going through a thing the prophet said the spirit they used back there to give their lives is the spirit you use to this daily overcome and I've told you over and over you bring them brothers down here they couldn't stand it all right he said oh yes it can well they're not here they're waiting on you and I if they're waiting on you or not they never admit it to say we couldn't have took the pressure that's right you did right just living day by day yep as a Christian uh you make it to where we just you know we just you know tough day by day my father is revealing his word right and it may be a long time sometime between what he reveals tonight and he meets me the next time that's no problem how's your school just keep walking down that line I don't know what I'm gonna preach after I finish this series but you know what I'm sure there'll be something sure right because I'm not worried about it I think I learned to trust my father amen it's what I've always tried to explain and you can't explain a gift but I've always tried to explain to you you know it if I could have the confidence in everything that I have in the basis that God will meet me and give me a message to preach to the people if I could have that confidence in everything else we wouldn't be here today because I can just say well Lord come and give me a message and he's never failed me yet but then I asked him for healing don't get it I ask you for you for healing we don't get it these child training us you say oh no that's an excuse I don't make excuses I tell the truth you tell the truth you'll have to make excuses child training all the way from the time of use the new birth all the way up through is child support training think on these things really and just just remember this place I think Wayne is going up to brother Richard's this weekend so remember him in their travel father we thank you we love you thank you for your word Lord thank you for salvation thank you for peace and joy Joy thank you for the fact that we can depend upon you Lord and I believe something that's been going on all through our Christian Journey we don't have to look back but we look back and see where you led us we don't have to look to the Future because we know you will lead us but we look at the present tense right now and see you dwelling Among Us pleased to dwell there just have your way with us reveal that unto us Lord in our hearts that we may see in bless each one and guide us Lord and let your love be with us forgive our sins because we don't want any problem we want to be a child that's raised and tutored directly and just let your light shine in each one of our hearts be with the people on the highway take care of everybody give a safe journey those Lord that there were those storms and things we just ask you to remove all that from us and we believe you and just lay everything into your hands to take care of your little bride around the world we love you and we thank you in Jesus name I want a meeting with all of the musicians and all other song leaders okay so if they will stay up here after we get through take the name of Jesus with you he will join a company preciously last week precious name oh brother foreign thank you
