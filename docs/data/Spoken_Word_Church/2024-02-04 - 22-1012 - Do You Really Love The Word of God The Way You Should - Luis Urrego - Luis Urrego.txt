that do you guys think that it might might be working because I have it on airplane mode I just cuz it worked last [Laughter] time all right well let's just go let's just go to the word and turn with me to Revelations chapter 2 Revelations chapter 2 and let's start at verse one Revelations 2:1 says unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things sayth he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I know thou Works in thy labor and thy patience and how thou can not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars has born and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love now you remember this is the words this is Jesus speaking it wasn't Paul and it wasn't one of the Apostles and it wasn't uh uh anybody Barnabas or anybody this was Jesus speaking to the church amen amen nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick out of his his place except thou repent praise the Lord Jesus you may be seated this evening amen man I want to just I want you all to just ask yourself a question as as I put it and you might have seen right here in the title but just wanted to just maybe do a like a little Sunday school lesson this evening but just think about and you know many times when when we preach as ministers we we pre preach things and and sometimes we preach things from our from our heart mainly things that we are experiencing amen um because what what what what what happens is that as maybe as you're studying the word of God and you're looking and then you're you're you want to look into yourself and really express yourself and what's happening in your life you see because um sometimes you know we we if we preach because uh we're preaching on someone at the church or we're preaching you know that's probably not the wrong that's probably the wrong way to go by but if you look at if I look at myself first and realize where I'm wrong where I should correct myself or where or where am I falling amen then you can maybe help the people more in that way you see so I you know it's a question that that we should all including me you know we need to ask ourselves is are do we really love the word of God the way we should and I just want to title that tonight and I want to make I want you to make it personal and ask that that question yourself do you really love the word of God the way you should amen because if you love the way the word of God the way you should it would reflect in many different areas in your life because it all stems from the word the way we live the way we we we we behave the way we act ourselves it all stems from that that and so many times you know when we don't do or we do um it it it it it reflects back on the way we look at the word of God how important is the word of God to you or how not important is the word of God to you you you see what I'm saying so in in looking at this here Paul uh not Paul but but Jesus was uh here at the first church age in Ephesus just in the first church age they had all they at at a point in time they had already left their first love they had already they were probably got got in on fire for God they they they they they they saw the word for their day and they were on fire but it was in a span of about 10 to 30 years according to history that after Paul had visited them that they started slowly waning they started slowly uh uh uh drifting and losing their first love that's right and some of us amen after a week that you've had a good service or you've had a Revival or you had something a week or just a few days later you're waning and it shouldn't be like that Saints amen it shouldn't be like that because Jesus was telling them Hey listen go back to your first love and if you want to find me where you left me that you you'll just find me right there wherever you left me that's where I'll be waiting for you amen and you re we realize that it's not Jesus leaving us it's it it's us leaving him because Jesus says here amen you left your first love now that denotes amen that that love that he's talking about here denotes H H it's it's it's the word Agape amen and so if it's the word Agape it means that it's a person that they left which was Jesus that they left and what is Jesus the word right so they didn't leave Paul they didn't leave they didn't leave the disciples they didn't leave anybody else what they left was the word and it wasn't all uh you know just at one moment they it was a slow transition well maybe I just won't go to church today come on oh maybe oh it's Wednesday I just won't go oh it's raining outside I won't go or maybe I just won't pray tonight you know I'm just so tired you know or maybe I'll just do just two three minutes you see it was just a slow transition until finally Jesus had to tell them listen you've you've you've gone you've gone too far youve you've left your first love amen praise God so we see that in verse four and in verse 5 Jesus tells them the following he tells them to remember this is their solution to remember the place that they were at before they fell cuz look what he says he says remember therefore from when thou art fallen and repent and do the first Works amen so first thing that they had to do was repent forever getting in that condition right amen and finally well first it says Jesus tells us to remember the place that they were at before they fell then repent for ever getting in that condition and finally go back and start over right aren't you glad that God allows us to start over that the grace of God you know nowadays young people and and and and and and kids you know when when they play video games and they're so accustomed to hey we could start all over as many times as you want to and just respawn and and then do all that kind of stuff you know and just start restart all over and there's just no end end L limits you know but that's how God is for us but at some point in time you're going to make his patience won't won't always you know at some point in time you're going to just completely you there's no way of coming back that happened to a woman during brother bram's time there was just no way for her to come back she completely blasing and she said she said that I could just see my my mom's Soul frying as in a frying pan and hell and she would didn't even bother her right I hope that we never get to a condition like that but you see God is a god of many chances but he's not a god of Eternal chances amen the world would would would would teach you that that's it's okay you can start over anytime and then you have unlimited lives but it ain't like that with God it ain't like that with God so there's many lives but not unlimited lives all right so if you read it here in verse 5 this is what it says in basic in basic English it says so keep in mind where you were at first and be changed in heart and do the first works or I will come to you and will take away your light from its place if your hearts are not changed amen so it was very important amen that God was giv them a chance to repent to do their works first F first works over you remember when you first come to the Lord and and and and the joy that you felt and and and the satisfaction that you got from the word of God and and and the and the I remember when I was 12 years old and I first accepted salvation in my life and I came to the Lord you couldn't put me you you could you you couldn't see me putting the word down hardly I was always listening to to to ministers preachers listening to to to I didn't know the message back then but I was listening to tapes CU that was back in 1992 but it was other preachers you know at the Baptist Church where I was listening and I was 12 years old you know sitting there taking notes on on what they were preaching and teaching it was very important to me my prayer life was just it wasn't it was I it was just I was on fire for God Amen how many remember that amen but how many know how many remember that knows that it should be the same way that's right even now you see but sometimes amen something happens along the way that you think you know too much or you think uh well it's all right I don't need to do all that anymore yeah I could take a little break you know I could take you know what when we do that that's when we start fading from our first love we start fading from our first love so you know where where maybe you might be failing amen as the question is asked as as as do you really love the word of God the way you should amen do you love the word of God more now than you did this time last year amen or this time two years ago three years ago because if you do it's going to make you change if you do you're going to come to church if you do you're going to be here and you're going to be not just not just for the sake of the preacher he's going to see you or not see you being at church but it's because you want to be in fellowship with your believers who are part of that word that you say you love yeah right you see amen so I'm not I'm not I'm not scolding anybody I'm just saying that's what the word says amen praise God amen amen now the Ephesian church was characterized by by the by their fervent love that that they had for one another that's the reason why Jesus dealt with them in Revelation with with with with regards to leaving your first love because in Ephesians 1:5 if you read there this is what Paul tells him he said wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints they were a people who loved one another amen and when you look at the love there that they had for one another it was the love Agape which was the same love that Jesus tell them in Revelations that they left it was the agape love that they loved one another so if you love the word of God correctly amen you're going to love one another right it just it just makes sense you're going to love God's people and you're going to love to be in the house of God Amen the love that they had for the for the Brethren stand from the love they had for Christ who is the word amen and so you see that in Ephesians 6:24 Grace this is when Paul was uh was finishing the letter to the Ephesian Ephesians and this is the last verse there he says Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity amen so it must have been that there was people there that were sincere people in Ephesians in Ephesus they LED Christ amen because you can't love the people if you don't love God Amen you something that you don't like to be around with or or or or you're not going to love you're not going to want to to to be around them amen so they must have really loved Christ in sincerity but here's the thing you could be so sincere and so and your motives right but if you just fell in one little thing or or or or or you say that one thing is not as important as the way you thought it was at one point amen that's when you start deviating because it's EAS when you do it the first time oh well it was easy then you do it the second time it becomes a little easier the third time it's easier and easier and so on until you finally you're at a point where wait a second last year I was here and then now I'm all the way over here and that's you know it it just that's what happens that's what happens and that's what happened to the Church of Ephesus yeah and so as I said as I mentioned earlier you know it took them about a span of about 10 to 30 years for them to get to that point after Paul had visited them their love and Zeal for the word started fading and remember who is the word is Jesus amen and I have here in the notes that the way you love and treat your wife is the way you love and treat God right so as I'm looking at this here I'm thinking I'm writing these these notes down I'm thinking how am I treating my wife because the way I treat my wife is the way I'm treating God that's right right and now the way you treat and love God and His word is the way that you will treat and love God's people amen if you don't think it's important to come and hear the word of God then that's how you treat God's people yeah it's not important I can just treat them any old way I could just tell them and talk to them in any old way joke about them and make fun of them any old way on because to you it's not important the word of God isn't that important you love and you do the duties of coming to church and you do what you're supposed to do but it's not ins sincerity because you're not sincere about God's word you can talk to some people and you start talking to them about the word they don't reply to you back about the word because they don't know how to they don't know about the word that's a clear evidence right there they're not in the word you start talking to them about Doctrine they don't know how to respond back to you clear evidence that they don't they don't look they don't study the word for themselves they don't read the word so where are we at do you really love the word of God the way you should oh brother Lis this ain't the seals you ain't breaking down that seed you ain't breaking down I'm breaking down things we need cuz if you don't know how to love your brother and you don't know how to how to come to church and and and and and do these basic things you ain't going to love the word of God enough to care about the seals and care about the church ages and care about Daniel 70 weeks I that's that's just the that's just the truth right amen Ephesians this is what brother brand says here I'll just let brother brandham tell you CU that's just brother Luis over that they're talking no brother Brown says it himself he says a few moments in the church age book he says a few moments ago I mentioned that John understood what it was to love God that great Apostle of Love would certainly see it when the church began to lose that first love of God in 1 John 5:3 he says for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments that's the love of God where are his Commandments in his word right so do you really love the word or you only love it on Wednesdays and Sundays come on do you have personal time with Jesus in in your closet in your study time do do you have a place in your home where where you study the word or just just let the preacher do all the studying and I'll just get Wednesday and Sunday for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments one little deviation from that word was a step away from Christ what happened to the Ephesians Church they lost their first love so that's the must have mean that they deviated somewhere or another right people say they love God they go to church they even shout and rejoice and sing and have a great emotional time just as we had here a few weeks ago but when it's all over watch and see if they are in that word walking in it living in it there are those people that that that that were here a few weeks ago rejoicing in the in the in the word where are they at tonight on excuses excuses living if they go through all the other and then don't walk in that word they can say they love God but their lives tell another story I wonder if John didn't see a lot of that before he died people saying they loved God but not obeying his word amen you you take that for what is worse I know I'm not just saying it about coming to the church but where are we failing God the most is it in prayer you know is it in backbiting your brother and sister is it talking about the preacher because he don't tickle our ears the way we like it right is it what what is it in your life that is hindering this church Church from moving forward with God right cuz I believe the church is marching and I know it's an individual walk but amen it's Al it's also amen we can't move forward if we're not if we don't love the word of God the way we should we're definitely not going to love one another the way we should amen praise God so here's the question H how do you love the word of God do you love the word of God in agape love or do you love the word of God in ailio love how do you love God Amen we all know the these definitions but in agape love Agape Love Is that love of God is the way he loves us his children amen and it's the love that he gives us amen when we receive the Holy Ghost love that is affection or benevolence uh a love feast th's definition tells us affection good will love Ben brotherly love love love Feast I was looking at what these love feasts are man a love Feast you know back in the 70s they had love feasts in the 60s they had love feasts but in a different way that's definitely wasn't Christian but they thought it was just the the the the just the best of the best drugs and all kinds of stuff but love feast in the when the Bible talks about love Feast it says a love feast or or Agape Feast they would call it as well was a fellowship meal eaten by Christians in the early church there is a Biblical evidence for the practice of these communal meals during which Christians gathered not just for the sake of sustenance and socializing but for the sake of Fellowship amen so that's the reason why it is called love Feast there's other scriptures where uh in the New Testament where that two words love Feast is is mention so it's Christians Gathering Together amen it's not well I'll just go into a church and just get the word of God and then I'll and then I'm out amen you need one another we need each other amen dur during a Time amen when things are going to get rougher and and squee squeeze uh Upon Us amen we're not going to we're going to need one another more than ever so let's PR start practicing now amen amen let's start practicing it now Christians Gathering not just for the sake of sustenance and socializing but for the sake of Fellowship do you love God that way or or do you love him in filo love see filio love is just only to approve of to like to sanction to treat affectionally or kindly to welcome bef friend to show signs of love only to show signs of Love yeah pretend maybe like you love somebody right or pretend like maybe you want to shake someone's hand but in reality that's not in your heart something is wrong then amen something is wrong you don't have God inside of you because you don't love your brother the way you should or your sister amen now brother Bram says in the message the everpresent water from the Rock and I'm I'm not going to hold you all too long tonight T night he says here now in the modern day it would be oh every Wednesday night prayer meeting every Sunday morning back to the back to the church what do we hear the same thing the preachers stand up and preach songs go on back see then you're just going as a line of duty you're not a worshipper I didn't say he said it a a worshipper goes there to worship to Express hisself before his God to praise God for his goodness to every word he hangs on to it amen that's a true worshipper you know in the age that we're living in Saints we we we we have used uh streaming services and watching church on te online as an excuse to not go to church anymore I'm just going to say the people that listen to tape stay home and listen to tapes that's an excuse for them to just not even go to church that's right that's right when brother brandham flatly condemns that yes sir but you see here's the problem with streaming services the problem with that is is that or or rewatching services that that you have you know that have already passed you if the preacher if next Sunday someone's listening to what I'm preaching right now and they don't like what I'm saying they could just go ahead in four 10 seconds four or rewind 10 15 20 seconds uh I don't want to hear that part okay I'll going to get this they you can pick and choose what you want to hear but in live preaching you got to hear what I'm telling you right you the only way you're not going to hear it is if you just walk out these doors which some people have done and they don't ever come back but so that is the problem with with people streaming services or rewatching replays it's all right if you watch a replay of a service but you've been at church you see there's people that do that as substitutions to going to church and it's wrong that's right exactly because you can pick and choose whatever you want to hear I don't like what he's saying now so let me just fast forward scrub about 30 seconds all right he's talking something I like now oh he's getting them seals now you know what the seals amen will cause you to do this will cause you to come to church that's right the seals is not just head knowledge amen the seals will cause you to actually live the seals which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen praise the Lord Jesus Just Like A Love Affair if you was going with a girl because you knew it was a Duty or you going with a a boy when you were young in other words a a young young man who is dating or talking to a girl or a girl talking to a boy if it's just a duty for them look what brother Brown says here mama wants me to go with this guy but I just can't stand him you don't get nothing of him coming to see you when he comes and visits you you're not going to get anything because you feel forced to talk to this guy like it was a rearranged marriage you know like they do some some places in India and maybe in the Middle East see or if or or if it's the girl or I'm sorry or if or if it's the same way about the girl to the boy or a boy to the girl you go with her she bores you she bores you now think about this in the context of church this is what brother brand is trying trying to talk about mama wants you to go with her because she is the type of girl that mama likes yeah that's how some some some kids amen they come to church this is how they feel yes and you see it all in their face you see it you see it and you know that there's no relationship there they feel forced they feel as if I got to come because otherwise I'm going to be grounded for a week or something and in reality that's no relationship there with God right there is no relationship there you go with her she bores you mama wants you to go with her because she's the type of girl that mama likes see it bores you no love affair but you don't care you don't want to clean up you don't want to go see her and it's why it's a horrible thing and when he is coming to see you my you just wish he would hurry on and go home so do you feel that way when you come to church now look what brother Brown continues to say here that's the same way it is when when you why does he preach so long some people ask on hey preacher just preach me too long why does he preach so long what what about all this stuff and everything see you're not in love I didn't say it brother Bram saying it you are not in love but when you really hang on to every word as the spirit gave you warning this morning see hanging on to every word yes that might that might be what he has been talking to you about holding on it's ET eternal life every word of God it's a joy to go to church it's a joy brother brand says to those who are still hanging on their first love their first experience that's right well I'm waiting for Brother so and so to come through the church and preach us happy amen you got to be happy all the way brother so and so ain't going to be here every Sunday what about Jesus Christ being here he makes me happy Wherever I Go amen the joy of the Lord is my strength not just when brother some and so comes through amen but when God is here amen that's what makes me happy when his people are here and we're worshiping in one Accord hallelujah amen that might be what he has been talking to you about holding on it's eternal life every word of God it's a joy to go to church under any circumstance that's right whether it's hot cold and different whether the people are fussing growling whatever they are doing it's still a joy to hear the word of the Lord then you're in love then with Christ that that's that's that's and then let's take it back remember to the Ephesian Church he's losing their first love then you're in love then with Christ see you love to go to church amen well honey here it's Sunday morning again I guess we have to wash up the youngans and get down there may it's boresome see you're not in love brother brandom said it is that how you feel about coming to church on Sunday is how you feel about coming to church on Wednesday it's a drag oh we just got to do it you know but if you are really in love you just can't wait till SU morning comes you've just got to get down there with them and we get and to leave the people of God they don't bore you why they are brothers and sisters amen amen praise God hey y it's it's it's part of a Christian's not just a duty amen but it's a love affair it's what he wants to do it's what she wants to do amen so in the way that we treat the word of God again the question is do you really love the word of God the way you should because if you do it will reflect on these other areas in your life yes all right now how important it was for the Lord that even when kings would sit before there was ever Kings set up in Israel this is what this is what God would make them do before they actually sat there on the throne all right can remember so I put in there we are Kings and Priests right God has made us Kings and Priests in Deuteronomy chapter 17 verse 18 it says and it shall be talking about the king and it shall be when he sth upon the throne of his kingdom that he shall write him himself a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priest the the Levites you know there is there is scientifically proven that when you take something and you write it or you copy it down or you're writing it yourself it sticks to you more it sticks to you more amen when you actually literally write it down now they've kind of perverted it nowadays because this is how they want us to write it down nowadays and this doesn't stick as good it gets lost eventually and and and it's not the same as is you actually writing stuff down right am that's why I I I if I'm taking notes I usually try to have a little notepad or or or or an actual pen or pencil to take notes with because it helps you remember things down well God knew that and so he knew that that that the king amen that he needed to write himself a copy of this law in the book and watch what verse 19 says and it shall be with him and he shall read therein just on Wednesdays and and Sundays just when he's feeling good just when his wife made him his Queen made him his coffee exactly the way he likes it and he shall read therein all the days of his life amen the king are you a king and priest that he may learn Watch What Happens that he may learn to fear the lord his God to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do them and watch what it continues to say that his heart be not lifted up above his Brethren Amen in other words that he doesn't think himself better than his Brethren this is what happens when you read the word of God and you're you're you're you're in the word of God you will not think yourself better than someone else amen amen you will try to maintain a a level with the your brother and your sister amen above his and that he turn not aside from the Commandment to the right hand or to the left to the end that he may Pro watch that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and his children in the midst of Israel amen amen so God didn't tell the king amen the first the that the when he became a king as soon as he sat down on the throne amen he was going to put up his feet amen and get on his iPad and watch Netflix or do whatever that's easy street now let I got all my servants no he was he had to put he put him to work and the first thing he needed to do was get in that word and write that word down amen that was what that was what God required praise the Lord Jesus so it's a duty for you and I Saints it's it and again it's not just a duty it should be a desire for us to be in the word of God Saints all the books in in this in this world can burn everything in this life can go away amen but if the word of God Amen has fully grabbed your life the way you should amen and if you're if it's if it's that entrance into you the whole world around you can fall amen but that word will always keep you Joy with joy amen everything around you can fall problems will occur and all kinds of things but that word of God will always be in your Forefront praise God I want us to look at the at at at David and at King David King David see King David took took uh uh uh uh um that to to uh it was it was very important for him what we just read there in Deuteronomy because look what he says in Psalms 1 he says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he was a king and he knew what the law said that's the reason why he said what he penned what he just penned day and night amen that's what the that's what Kings and Priests do Psalms chapter 19 verse 711 this is a good 7-Eleven right here 7-Eleven you at the corner you get a junk food and makes you fat this 7-Eleven amen it's spiritually the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple speaking about the word of God the statutes of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart you want happiness you want Joys you you feel depressed amen the statutes of the Lord are right that that's the right medicine right there amen the Commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes the fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether every time I read this verses it takes me back to to I want to sing them because there was a song that I learned back in the early 90s it was an AC capella group that that that sang this this the these these verses and every time I I read them I I just want to see the fear of the Lord is clean all right I'll stop you don't want to hear that all right verse 10 more watch this now more to be desired are they than gold what's more to be desired than gold the word of God right yay then much fine gold what's what's better what you know in this life you know they gold is precious right it's beautiful it's shiny it's huh it's Asphalt in heaven it sure is but you see the word of God is better than than fine gold David says here amen sweeter also than honey and the honey and the honeycomb you know as I was looking into this and I was reading looking uh not sure how how how how true it is but I was reading or listening to something and they said that the way children used to go back to school and the way they would write they would they would pen they would have these tablets that they would make notes on and the tablets were made out of wax and uh they would have like a some sort of writing utensil but in other in other for them to be able to to I I I guess for for them to be able to write in a smoother way they would kind of layer it the wax a little bit with honey and so as as as they were writing inside the tablet they would write and then it would kind of have distilled in with a little bit of Honey the pen and so as they were right they would kind of just lick lick and write and and kind of get a little bit of that honey as they were writing amen God says that the word of God is sweeter than that honey what was written amen the written word is sweeter than all the honey what's sweeter than honey I don't know honey is very sweet you can only just have a little bit and afterwards he man it just don't taste too good if you get too much amen but that's how the word of God is it's sweeter also than honey and the honey comb the fresh honey that's dripping off of the honeycomb the word of God is sweeter than that praise the Lord amen moreover by them by what by that word is thy servant warned and in keeping of them there is great reward amen praise the Lord Jesus so it's not just hearing it amen but in keeping them there's a great word praise the Lord T Spurgeon said the following he said if God shall give you a promise you will taste it like a wafer of honey and feed on it and if he shall give you a precept you will not stop to look at it and say Lord I don't like this as well as the promise but you will receive that and feed upon that also amen and when the Lord shall be pleased afterwards to give you some Revelation with regard to your inward experience or to your fellowship with his dear son you welcome it with joy because you love any truth and every truth as long as you know it to be the truth of God's Own word amen amen it doesn't matter who's preaching it doesn't matter who who's behind the pulpit amen you love the truth because the truth is is being preached amen it is a blessed sign of Grace in the heart when God's words are sweet to us as a whole it is a blessed sign of Grace in the heart when God's words are sweet to us as a whole when we love the truth of God not cast it not cast into a system or a shape but as we find in God's word amen praise God now in Psalms 119 David continues the following and and he says this wherewith all shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed theto according to Thy word amen you want to clean your way young man young lady amen get in the word you you want help in your life get in the word amen that's right you want eternal life get in the word you want healing amen you want positive thoughts get in the word amen it all comes and stems from the word with my whole heart David says have I sought thee oh let me not Wonder from thy Commandments amen you see how it that's what the Ephesian Church did at the beginning they wandered from the Commandments of God but here David is saying Lord don't let me Wander from thy Commandments Thy word have I hid in mine heart that I might not sin against thee amen so when you hear the word of God it's not just about just listening to it at the moment and forget what you heard amen but keep it and retain as much of it as you can amen and go on move forward so that why so that you won't so that you won't sin against God blessed art thou Lord teach me thy statutes with my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth amen so it should be in your lips as well I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as much as in all riches amen praise God am you know I wonder how we would act amen if somebody over here and came through here and said we're paying your house we we're and you're going to have an extra $100,000 in your bank and I mean you knew for a fact that's what was going to happen your house is going to be paid for and you're going to have a nice shiny car parked outside side when you when you leave this building some of you ain't going to be the way you I see some of you all right now when you know it's for you when you know it's for you and and and and that's what God that's what it was promised to you amen got your name on it amen everything but B but David says here that I rejoiced in the way of of thy testimonies as much as in all riches in other words David had riches David had wives and he had he had things in his life that he could Rejoice about but he said the law of the Lord the word of God was much better than all thaten amen I will meditate in thy precepts verse 15 and what and have respect unto thy ways respect what an important thing in this hour amen do we respect the word of God the way we should I will Delight myself in thy statutes I will not forget Thy word amen

just [Laughter] pepperoni that was good all right let's finish up here are five tips to falling in love with God's word starting today starting today five five ways you can start falling in love amen this is this is where you take action now all right if you feel like you've lost your first love if you feel like it's a dread to come to church if you feel like the Brethren around you just just get on your nerves and the sisters around you just get on your nerves then this is a way to start it's all it all starts with the word of God get in the word and you won't feel like that about your brother get in the word and you won't feel like that about your sister and you won't feel like that about your preacher amen all right first one read your Bible every day now brother Brown said that but look what second 2 Timothy 2:15 says study to show thyself approved unto God Amen don't do it for others do it unto God Amen a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth that's is what I was trying to say earlier you talk to some people and you know they haven't been in the word of God you can just is tell by the way they talk to you or the lack of talking to you about the word of God they'll talk to you about anything else but they won't talk to you about the word because they don't want to know they they haven't been in the word but out of the abundance of the heart speaketh the mouth Jesus said right amen all right tip number two meditate on what you have read don't just read the word don't just just read the word and say I've done my duty I've read 10 verses for today no now start looking and meditating about what you just read about maybe get into it maybe start looking at the definition of a certain word that you just read that that just kind of caught your attention maybe and you and you will find out that you start doing that and it will start it's just like a I mean you start going down and next thing you know it's been 30 minutes wow I've been reading the word of God for 30 minutes brother John when initially you said was I'm only going to do 5 10 minutes I've been on here 30 minutes studying the word of God that's how it is that's how it starts look what Joshua 1 18 says this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein Wednesday and Sunday that thou May no doesn't say that right that therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein how many times have we read something similar tonight like that right the King was supposed to do that remember the king in Deuteronomy David mentioned it in Psalms to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success amen tip number three ask the Holy Spirit to teach teach you what he wants you to learn or in other words give you Revelation I have the habit of when I read the word of God I always pray I say Lord reveal to me what I'm about to read help me to just grab something from there that I can just go instantly apply into my life so just pick up the word and and and just just randomly and just start reading amen that's good that's a a good start you picked up the word and started reading but pray about what you're about to read and I believe God Honors that many times that that that I've done that uh God always never fails to show me something never never amen so ask God for Revelation amen the holy spirit will teach you because what did he say he said he will lead us and guide us unto all truth right all right John 14:26 says but the comfort which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you that's what that was Jesus speaking there's another thing that you can do you can pray the scriptures that's right amen amen I'm not into into the habit of doing that but I I'd like to I'd like to start doing that because there's an anointing that comes with that praying the scriptures over over your family praying the scriptures over over yourself over situations amen and if you don't know amen go back in the Psalms and there's plenty of content there for you to pray about that you can some way or another apply that content that that word to your your situation Psalms 11913 says with my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth so pray the the the the judgments of God or or the word of God Amen and claim it with thy mouth amen there is one place in Psalms 119 amen where where he says that I will raise my hands unto thy Commandments I will raise my hands unto Thy word hence the reason why we raise and say Amen to the word of God as it's going forth amen and we just don't sit there but David said to do that amen amen all right and then tip number five thank the Lord for his words amen be always thankful 2 Peter 1:4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in in the word through lust amen thank God for his word amen be thankful always and how do we thank God for his word amen we just we express it with our lips but we also express it with our actions we obey the word of God Amen praise the Lord Jesus and so you could take those five tips with you and hopefully you can start applying them tonight when you get home amen put them to action it was only just five I didn't give you a whole book just five amen now I I want to finish with with with the example of Mary and and and Martha and just how how beautiful it was when Jesus came in in in in Lazarus home and Mary was there uh Martha was there and Jesus started speaking the word talking about the word and Mary wasn't concerned about anything else but to be at the feet of that word she didn't care about that the dishes needed to be done she didn't care that it was cold whether it was cold hot outside or whatever amen what she cared about was to be at the feet of that word because she knew that that moment could it was going to go away at some point she was going to take full advantage of that word yes now the Jesus Christ being the word himself amen he is the word praise God he is the the physical word was right there but she was interested in see in hearing what he had to say while Martha was over there slaving away and doing everything she needed to do maybe she was preparing for the church dinner or whatever you know that we could get so busy with church things and we forget that Jesus is speaking you can be so busy with church and you and you missing out church that's right that's what Martha was doing she knew Jesus was there she knew that that that that that she was at her home she she wanted to serve him too but she was wanting to serve him in a physical way while Mar while Mary was trying to serve Jesus in a spiritual way but saying I need something for my soul and I can only receive it from him so she was was attentive and Martha got onto her Martha actually got onto Jesus Martha rebuked Jesus for what Mary was doing and said why don't you tell her to come on here and help me bake these cookies and whatever and Mary said Martha Martha you're too worried about Subway you're too worried about Taco Bell you're too worri about all that stuff you know why don't you just come down here and worship me amen and you're worshiping Me by listening to what I have to tell you remember who is the true worshipper the true worshipper is the one who continues daily in the word amen that is the true worshipper so I wanted to leave you with that thought look at Mary and Mary did that without the Holy Ghost what what about you and I with the Holy Ghost what kind of attitude should we have towards the word it should actually be more sweeter and and and and and it should have more effect on us amen than than ever before it doesn't matter what happens in our life the word always goes firsten amen amen no my mom does no the word goes first no my dad does no the word goes first that's right my my pastor does the word always goes first amen and when you do that God will take care of your pastor God will take care of your mom God would take care of your dad God would take care of everybody every family member when you put God first in your life amen so may God bless you all let's stand to our feet have the musicians come do you really love the word of God the way you should are you really in love with him the way you need to be we are in a late hour I preached this sermon to myself before I preached it to you Saints God help us God help us just because you know sometime well that the preacher you know he he he's he he's he's always in the word and he's always amen we sometimes we feel like we're not enough in the word Amen brother brandham he felt like like he was 50 something years old and he felt like he hadn't done anything for God how much more how much more us look at he had traveled all over the world preaching the gospel thousands maybe millions of people saved under his ministry up to that point and he felt like he didn't do anything amen so we need to be more sincere with this that we have in this hour praise God what do we have brother boy the world will try to satisfy that long you need a prayer more than welcome to pray with you may search the world but you be just as for you'll never find true satisfaction until you have found the Lord for only Jesus can satisfy your [Music] soul holy Jesus can your soul only he can change your heart and make you whole he'll give you peace you never knew sweet love and joy in heaven to to know but you know I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus

up and and then you just really can't make it to the house of God you know I'm not talking about those things but you know I'm just really deliberately just speaking about the people who just deliberately miss church because they just don't really don't want to be here and then you make some excuses to not be a church where the word of God is being preached amen that's a problem and that's not a problem with the with with the word it's not a problem with with with the people not a problem with the preacher it's a it's a a spiritual heart problem maybe some point we we'll talk about matters of the heart it's a heart it's a heart problem that needs to be dealt with because a son and daughter of God wants to be where the people of God are amen wants to be where the word of God is oh but I could press play my home but where's the fellowship in that cuz isn't the God's people that have the same holy ghost that you have amen aren't they part of God as well praise the Lord just as an encouragement and as a challenge to each one of us to be more sincere about about this walk in our lives amen let's just bow our heads our heavenly father we thank you once again for the
