comes to me we're glad to have his wife and the kids with him they spent the night with us last night and that was a good one for sister Jones because she'd been there many times before because she was there when she was little and coming up you know but we appreciate them doing appreciate her staying and everything we just pray to the Lord a blessing amen so let's just say Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I won't receive I want to see here Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you yes I want to see you I lifted up shining in the light of your glory or without your power and lovely holy shining in the light of your glory oh God yes Lord yes you're holy holy holy and I can hear yes it should be all of our desires right right amen and one day we will he gave us a promise he gave us a word first Samuel this morning chapter 16. we'll speak on David this morning but I titled it recognized we got to recognize Who We Are amen first off we got to recognize that we need him but I thought the oldest message come to me and and it just kind of you really encouraged me so I look forward to maybe encourage y'all this morning uh I know along the way the battles are tough we need encouraging and we need to realize Who We Are right and we need to realize that he's on our side and and as we as we look at David here you can say David knew who he was yeah David recognized in the scripture who he was and uh so we'll take him this morning but uh first Samuel chapter 16 start reading in verse 5. and he said Peace boy I come to you to sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice and he Sanctified yes and his sons and he called them to the sacrifice and it came to pass when they had come that he looked upon Elam and he said surely the Lord's anointed is before him verse 7 says but the Lord said unto Samuel look not at his countenance nor his height or a statue because I refused him right right for the Lord seeth not as man saith and for man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart and I thought of that scripture itself I thought a little God look at us we can always point to that brother being a better minister or that person can sing better than I can or that person lives better God's not looking at that it's looking at your heart he's looking at your character and he goes on down and says then Jesse and called Adrian I mean go on down and goes through each one of the sons verse 11 said in Samuel said unto Jesse or hear all thy children and he said they remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the Sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse sin and fetch him so we're not set down until he come hither and he sinned and he brought him in now he was ready and without a beautiful countenance and goodly look upon them and the Lord said I Rise and anoint him for this is he then Samuel took the Horn of all and anointed him in the midst of the brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward right if you read the texts said the Holy Spirit come upon David and I thought of the scripture there and he says from that day forward it didn't leave him when he failed it didn't leave him when he went through hard times it didn't leave him when he went through the valley it didn't leave him when he went through battles it was with him from then on right and if we believe that same God lives today he's with us right when we're in our Hard Times exactly we're in our battles right when we're faced up against the wall that we don't see tomorrow he's there with us he's laying there amongst us you know the the story of the footsteps Prince of the sands of time he says why did you leave me in the hardest times and he said son I didn't I carried you I carried you to say what a prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus Lord Jesus come over lord move me out of the way Lord Jesus say something Lord to be an encouragement Lord bless us in some way touch your word to the to our hearts Lord then we may go from here Lord and rejoice in your name we pray amen amen seated and I thought of this text and I thought of David here and I thought of the scripture we read there and and I'm sure of Samuel and and Jesse both looked at the sons and thought this is he this is he look at him he stands six foot five in the Statue he's got Square shoulders he's a man's man but God didn't look upon that and I look at all of us and I look and I think you know we can look even in the denomination around we can look at your your H.H Richards and we can look at you Billy grahams and all the mighty things they can do but God didn't choose them right he chose you and he chose you and I heard a brother say this one time in Genesis he says God said let there be light and there was light and they never went back and had to adjust it to make it perfect right when he spoke it it was so right right and so when God spoke you he don't have to work on you right he spoke you as a child of daughter of God you just have to recognize who you are amen because he's done spoken his word and said who you are but we got to recognize who we are and I think of David here and if we don't down the scripture you know we know the story of how the anointing come upon David and then Saul himself picked David to play to him to sense that evil spirit and I thought you know here's Saul the Bible says the spirit of God left Saul and an evil spirit come upon us all and I thought of that and I thought yeah and here he is what did he do he turned and he looked for that anointing back because he knew that anointing comforted him and even though he didn't have it he knew that anointing and I think of you and I you get a born-again experience everybody likes to be around you they may not agree with you but they like to be around you because you bring an anointing with you you recognize that you can change that atmosphere so I thought of David here and David goes on down and we we know the story of David and Goliath but I look at David and I think here's David and he goes through the batter of the bear on the Battle of The Lion and the battle of the all of this and he comes down he says who is this right it's just another Temptation right it's just another fight and I look at us now what's our fights watch out battles right right it's it's not in the it's it's not a lion no more we don't live in the jungle we don't have Lions roaming too and fro we don't have a Goliath to come against us but look at the trials that face us every day what's the things that touches us what's the what's the Temptations take take your sling right and kill that rise up against that and I thought of that and I thought here it is brother we're going to preached a message perfect strength and perfect weakness and he says now what was it now he was David was the most unlearned one of the much he had no schooling of fighting he had nothing no no nothing about it so he had no schooling for none of this battle that was set before him but he recognized that there was a God and he took the weakest thing they had Spears armors bows and everything else and David took a little slingshot right with a rock in it but see he knowed he could try he know who he could trust him or what he could trust in he confessed his weakness but his faith in God and I think of David his brother was explaining him here the most ill litter one when it come to fighting it'd been like it'd been like in my day if I would have tried to get in the ring with a Mike Tyson it wouldn't have worked this guy knew what he was doing and I don't know the first thing about holding my fist up yeah but here David David didn't look at that David didn't look at the circumstances sitting before him David didn't look at the Goliath and how big he was David recognized who he was David recognized that he had been anointed by the by the prophet he had been anointed by the prophet with the Holy Spirit and descended upon him come upon him and he knew that he was going to be a king and he knew that if he was going to be a king that Goliath couldn't touch him because he had to live through that stance and he looked at that and he thought what is this man he's coming against my God right my God's delivered me from the bear my God still living me from the line he'll deliver me from this man and then if we read down in the Scripture it takes him and Saul takes him in and tries to armor him with breasts tries to put away put a put a shield on and put a helmet on and give him a give him a sword and he says I don't want this I don't know this and I think of you and I what do we do so many times God gives us his word and then we try to put science involved with it then we try to put our abilities involved with it well you know I think God would want me to do this because I'm better at this than no maybe God wants to train you over here maybe maybe you don't realize that that you know David wasn't a fighter but yet in the Bible is one of the greatest stories told was his fight and I looked at that and I thought look at my life how do I treat God do I really recognize who I am each one of us do we really recognize Who We Are and he says all he wanted he said is I got my trust in God and here I go he didn't worry about the outcome he didn't worry about the circumstances he didn't worry about what was around him David says I got my trusting God and here I go and you know what that's where we was you know we spoke last night but that's the way we was we come to the altar when we first come from The Altar and we got baptized we're on fire from God it don't matter you stop at everybody you see and tell them about God you don't think about why you shouldn't you don't think about why I couldn't you don't think why it's not possible you step right but now as time goes on we start backing off that we need to fully recognize who he was he goes That's it the giant went down that's right that's what we need today brother we need today men like David not University experiences and I thought of that and I thought you know brother Brennan wasn't preaching against education but he's preaching what it would do to you right he's preaching what it would do to you so you got to recognize there is a God Amen right if you can't recognize there is a God you can't go no further you recognize there is a God and you know you look at nature itself if that don't tell you there's a God you know if they don't tell you that this is one of the songs I enjoy so much as the song says who told the sea that it could only come this far right right who told the winds to only blow this direction who told the rain to only Reign for so long and move on hold all this God's in control and you got to recognize where you were in your walk with God exactly so many times we put ourselves higher than we really are so many times we put ourselves lower than we really are you're a child of God you have every asset behind you that God is that God has himself you have to recognize you need help before you can receive it right so many times we come to church and we sit in church and and we're like the we like the brothers here of David we look the part we seem the part we sing well we praise well but then on the inside of the inside God's not moving and I look at these things and I question myself and I question God and I said God why this and I hear God tell me he says the Revival is in my elect it's not in the world and we need a stirring up in ourself we need a rededication in our self we need to come back and focus on where God's brought us from and where he's trying to take us and I even here first of all you know David didn't want the advanced weapery Advanced weaponry you know and I think in today's day you know that'd be a you know that'd be whatever the new and latest bomb is David didn't want that he just wanted God right such a humble heart he just wanted God he didn't want the fame to come with it he tried to give it to somebody else he said want somebody else fighting won't somebody want one of your brothers come on why y'all gonna beat him but God called him to that and he had to recognize that recognize there was a God he was a Son of God and did not slow him down just because everyone else doubted he knew God had moved before would move again you know everybody around him at the time I see I see him in the scripture here and I know we can read through the scripture and I see David here and and David comes in and they're all calling him a fool what are you talking like this for you can't you can't do nothing but you're just you're just a little runny old boy I don't know what you're up against we'll train military men we're trained in the ways of warfare we know look at that what we're facing look at that what we're facing you can't do anything with that he turns around he says but my God has and my God will continue so many times we need to look back at what God's did for us so many times we need to look back that I was a drunk I was a sinner I was I was a smokaholic I was a prostitute I was a what did God bring me from to get me to hear and now that he's got me here he can continue moving me on to that Perfect Bride hey look at that and he says why do we doubt God now I look in my life I was talking about Samuel last night I have two brothers that I Love Flesh brothers that I love with everything in me raised in the same house raised unto the same Pastor on message pews the same way I was raised all their life now both of them's mixed up in the marriage kids by other people don't even live together doing that why not me why not me look what God saved me from right look what God saved me from look what God saved you from his grace his Mercy is the only reason I stand there his grace and his mercies the only reason why I can stand and say that I'm a Child of God his grace his Mercy allows me to forget my past and realize that he forgave and forgotten and there if he can do that how much more can he do with me how much more can he do with me if I truly humble myself and getting me out of the way what can he do with me what can he do with you you don't have to be as preacher you don't have to be a speaker you don't have to be a singer you don't have to be a musician what can God do with you if you'll let him do that what can God do with you and I look in judges 33 and 31 and it speaks on shamgar and after him was Shem gar the son of April which slew the Philistine 600 men with an ox code and then also delivered Israel right shamgar wasn't a preacher shamgar wasn't a singer shamgar was just trying to try to make a living for his family right shamgar was slaving in the fields working hard as he could trying to feed his family what was he upset about he was upset about the Philistines coming and taking his food he was upset about the Philistines taking him and took what he worked for it but he finally stood up when did he stood up he stood up when he recognized who he was he stood up when he recognized that he was a seed of God he recognized that you know what them Philistines can't overcome me they can't overcome what's in me well if I say greater is he that send me the heathe in the world he can't come over me I want to stand up for what I believe in and so many of us in this day and time it's so easy the world's falling apart around us the pressure is coming down on the bride so hard it's so easy to go well I I go to church there but that's it yeah don't stand for what you believe in think God's going to bless you when you're a coward you think God's going to bless you when you turn your back on him God's only going to bless you when you stand for him how long how many years did how many years did brother say one time that he took this from the Philistines they kept coming in year after year and taking what was his they kept coming and God standing by that shamgar if you'll stand up I'll be there Jim Garf you'll stand up how many of us is the same way is he telling us the same thing brother and sister if you'll stand up in that situation I'll be there brother and sister they're one that's putting you through that trial at work I'll be there for you but stand for my name stand for my name stand like sham guard did stand up and say that enough is enough this is my god this is my family this is my family's food and I'm standing for it but it's so easy to take the easy Road if you ever get a true revelation of Who You Are you're not going to be kicked around you're not going to be pushed around you're not going to take it from your from your employer you're not going to take it from your boss you're not going to take it from your family other brother home I made a statement it's Wednesday night and he says we do so much out of our way for everybody else and not for God and I thought of that and I thought you know how powerful that is because what do we do for for for our kids school they don't even believe the same God we believe in how much do we go out of the way and cost us money and time to help them not that it's wrong to have them how much money and time do we spend watching them watching our kids play sports how much time do we watch our kids play in the band do this do that do this we run to and fro how much time do we give God how much time did we give God and I thought of that in my own life and I try to take it to me first and my family and I think what what's wrong what's wrong with me because I can so easily get caught up and forget who gave it all to me because without him I'd be where my brothers are I'd be in a mixed up mess laying in sin somewhere without God right but his grace his Mercy kept me from that and if God's did that for you how much more is he wanting to do for you I look at the prophet's life and the prophet said the world went come in the tree and he said don't smoke before I could defile your body in any way well he had to be there to help him through every bit of it but he had I mean he had an end time of what he wanted him to do and the reason why he had to keep him from that because he had a gift to be a prophet and he had a message to bring and he wanted a clean vessel to bring it in how much more of any of us he said what brother what brother brother I've already did this but God brought you from it God brought you out of it and when he brought you out of it he forgave you and when he forgave you he put you up on a rock and he said here you are now you're now my son and now I love you I've always loved you but now you recognize where that love is in 62 convinced and concerned and that's one one of my one of my messages I really love he said if you can be convinced that God takes a hold of you shakes your heart makes you a new creature in Christ Jesus let sickness and death or anything else come along you're convinced he can take good care of you right sure amen I like that shamgar the little fella we talked about the other night he was concerned about his family yes he knowed they was hungry and the Philistines come in a thousand men I believe 600 men something I believe 600 of them come up with armed men and he was convinced concerned about his family because they had starved to death that winter but he stayed there thinking and studying what could he do he stayed there until he was convinced that God keeps his promise and I thought of another place where brother Brandon went on and he talked about how we got to have this and this and this and line and he says they used to pray for ten days and then they was convinced that it was God and I thought of us how long have we we've lost our prayer life we've lost it and why we lost it we've lost it because we've lost we're not really convinced that it works right because you know if I was convinced that I could run to that back door and run back and I'd lose 10 pounds I'd do it three or four times it would help but what do we do we know we say Prayer Changes Things but then do we pray enough right right and I thought of that's what he said there and he says he stayed there until he was convinced he didn't say how long he stayed there it may have been two or three years before he was convinced we need to stay there we need to when we come to the altar to forgive we need to stay there until we're convinced God's changed us if you're not if you're not just exactly right with God and you're sitting here thinking well you're not talking about me because I need save well you know it works the same way with salvation if you need saved you need to find that Altar and you need to stay there until you're convinced and then once you're convinced then God will show you who you are then you can recognize what he's trying to do for you and then you can accept what he's given you but until you do that he can't move on yet he needs you to stand on that how many you know how many examples does each of us have we talked about a living God last night each one of us we could circle from Pew to Pew each one of us has got at least one testimony well God's moved in their life or their close family's life don't let it come commonplace David here David I always referred back to it he said the only the Goliath standing the other line was there and he left I can do this too yeah look back at our lives and think recognize Lord recognize that God you've moved from me before you'll move for me again goes on down and says Shem go he could have said I'm a Seed of Abraham and Shem girl could think of the natural seed but then he goes on down and he says how much more of us being the Royal Seed of Abraham Memorial Seed of Abraham who we are he he never ain't some God never wanted to learn he didn't go to school to learn how to fight he he didn't he didn't put his money into technology he didn't put his he just got down and he began to pray he says God what can I do God what can I do and when God decided to use him he jumps out that window with an ox goat and he says come on Philistines God doesn't showed me right and he wasn't scared a bit he didn't back up he didn't stand in the corner he just come at him and once he'd come at him he slew off 600 of them and I say we need to do the same thing grab that Ox goat step out on faith step out on faith and forget about what your families told you forget about what the world's telling you forget about how bad the economy is forget about how much pressure is on the message Believers forget about all the chaos around it grab your faith stand up and take it right because it's yours God gave it to you and I he gave us happiness he gave us joy he gave us blessings abundantly if we'll stand up and we'll take it he never wanted to learn how to do it he says now wait a minute I'm Gonna Roll your seed I'm a Seed of Abraham I'm circumcised so you know all these Philistines are good Warriors they've been practicing a long time I'll go down to the Seminary and get my PhD or lld I learned how to duel I learned how to how the church rules if he had done that that's all he would have known anything about and I look at the world today and that's what we have we send a we take any of our denominations and they send a person off to school for 10 years to be to be a professor to be a to be a minister and they come back and all they know is what they taught them and they don't know God how much more do we need men that know God maybe they don't talk good brother Branham says how can he use me I can't even talk good I'm from Kentucky Moses said the same thing he said God you can't use me I said he's like I I started well you know what that's good excuse I'll give somebody talk for you God don't want to hear our excuses right God called you now to do something he wants us to do it and you know we can't get out here we talk about all the time we look around and I think here we are we talk about the raptures coming the Rapture is coming I can't wait to go home some of the songs sung this morning I love them we'll see him on that day we'll see him we need to make a move we need to recognize God's waiting on you and I God's waiting on you and I to move to him because he's sitting there with his arms outstretched saying children come come come unto me come unto me I want you to come I've waited all these thousands of years so that my word can be manifested but I need you to recognize who you are I need you to recognize that this word was for you what did Jesus at 12 year old and he stands up there and he says this day this scripture is fulfilled he recognized who he was he recognized that he was that scripture that was for him and that was his day and that's who he was that's what you got to do you've got to come to this Bible and find you in this scripture find you in this word and when you recognize that this is you then walk out on it then you can take that Oxford sham guard shamgar recognize you know what I am this he can't take that for me and that's when he come out amongst them and when he come out amongst them he didn't come out there backwards he'd come out there with everything he had and how much more does we need to do that we need to recognize that we are in this scripture that we're not just an afterthought of God that we're not just something that you know that happened after they closed no the book's still open and the book's laying here opening we're coming to the end of time and here we are we're being will being manifested in these scriptures we need to recognize that we're in them scriptures and the bride's going to recognize she's in there and when she recognizes she knows she's not going to worry about her schooling she's not going to worry about how smart she is she's not going to worry that maybe she don't have every revelation God didn't put a thing in there and said that you had to know every Revelation to get to heaven he said believeth on me and he shall be saved believeth on me and he shall be saved brother Brennan said when we get over there we'll be eternity still learning things right so we're not going to know it all here we're going to know a lot what God shows us right but first you got to realize it's him the giving us knowledge you got to recognize where you are in that he says you can't match the enemy I can't match it but remember I'm living under a promise Hallelujah that's already in his powers and been more than matched and conquered and cast down I'm more than a conqueror right now not myself but I'm in him who conquered him for me he said Frank give it a minute then get your hearts go run the devil out run the devil of dead away don't let the devil of Doubt steal your healing don't let the devil of Doubt steal your pride steal your salvation steal everything that God's gave you just because somebody says oh he don't move that way no more you know the days of Miracles are passed really since when because my God didn't tell me that and I've seen it too much in my life I've seen it too much in my family's life I've seen it too much in my church I've seen it too much in the message around the world don't tell me that the days of Miracles have passed I've done experienced it you can't convince me of that all it is is a thought it's a seed of the devil to try to increase doubt in you it's a seed of the devil to try to convince you that God ain't going to move like that no more but he still moves the same if it's not so then Hebrews is wrong when it says the same yesterday today and forever and if that's wrong then throw the whole book out because it ain't worth nothing but it's right and it's true and it's absolutely the word of God and being the word of God he says I can't do it but he that's in me can David never did walk into one of his armies and says oh David here I'm going to show y'all how it's done sham guard didn't jump out the window said here I am shamgar he says my God is in me and here I come here David said he didn't say whenever whenever he made the comment we'd go back and read the scripture he didn't make the statement I'll deliver Goliath he says my God will deliver him into my hands my God you know what man you can't heal each other we can't save each other can come up here as much as you want and all the ministers could stand in here and anoint you and cover you head to toe and we can't do nothing for you but if you can just believe if you can just believe an ounce of faith you can just believe then he can come down and take it all away from him and there's nothing too great for God I look at the little things I think you know I think this little thing comes to my hand when I was at work it's on a Wednesday night my baby daughter and and the McDonald's got the big heavy metal doors and she went out the door and on the hinge side she laid her fingering on that door closed and my wife said when she got there it was as thin as that piece of paper it was and she was crying she's four years old but all she wanted was whether home would pray yeah brother Homer went over there and prayed and Carol said they kind of forgot about it she quit crying what have you so when they got home said she asked her she said tap the house your finger and tether couldn't even remember which hand it was on I couldn't remember which hand it was on don't tell me the days of Miracles were passed you say oh that's just a little finger we've seen cancer fall off people it's not just stories people it's not just stories Church God's still moving today God's still moving but you know what the people that receives that healing they had to recognize there was a god and once they recognize there was a guard they had to recognize that they needed him and then once they recognized that they had to recognize that he could do it not them right so many times we look at our own lives and we think well I can do this I'm a mechanic by trade I look at a car and I think well I could fix that and then three hours later I'm stomping my head going no I can't fix that because it's just the way it is but so many times you know they used to tell me they just tell me they said well how do you do it and I said well somebody calls me and says they broke down on the interstate I began to pray and I get in the car I'm driving to him and I see God it could be one of a million things God just laid my hand just take take this that you gave me and and help me to try to help this brother and it's never failed that I've always been able to do something to get them down the road and I thank God that may be little but he is so concerned about your little things he's so concerned about the little aspects of your life the ones that you look at and think oh you know he ain't got time for that he's got that and all he cares and if you'll recognize he cares he can move for you he cares for the little hair he cares for the little thing that you may think is nothing and he's just he just wants he just wants you to care enough to ask him and I thought of that you know what he said he says he didn't want to learn how to do it well David didn't want a great weapon because we look at it you know and you you know they look at me in the example I gave of going to work on somebody's car and they say well he's a mechanic that's what no that's not why they're trying to take God out of it and that's what David and Shem go in our examples here that's what they didn't want to happen they didn't want to stand up there with the Learned men in the Warfare and everything else and they didn't want him to say yeah but you know Saul trained him for 10 years you know and he trained him in Every Act of war and he trained him how to fight the Goliath and David just used his training no no they didn't want that they wanted to be obvious there was God on the sand and then you and I in our daily lives we need to give him the praise back for that he says he he Delights himself in our praises and worships to him he does it for us not asking anything back he heals your body he saves your soul he gives you a job he gives you the finances to take care of all your needs he gives you Transportation he gives you a pastor he gives you a church he gives you and he don't ask for nothing back but he Delights himself in your praises and when you praise him that just makes him want to give you more just makes you want to give him more it just makes me want to give you more because you know what how much more you know we talked about the brother brother Dale mentioned yesterday and you know he said he said not my sons no I'm their dad anything I have stairs not only they don't necessarily have to ask for it they just tell me they need it that's how God is everything lays in his hands and all you got to do is ask God you see my need God you see where I'm at this morning God you see that maybe I've stumbled a little girl you see the trial the battle I'm going through God moved from me move from me move from me and I think then I think oh we are we really convinced right that we need him as much as we do or am I really convinced that I need him Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday in Romans 12 I believe it is Paul says I beseek you to give your everyday life and one version says you're Every Day Life you'll go to work life are you do you really do you really recognize that you need him all the time that we recognize that you're part of the Bride you're part of that bride that he spoke before the foundation of the world and he says I'll have a bride that stands perfect on this day and cross the mystery of God revealed brother Brown says his body would do the works that he promised like in mark 16. his body was not held in the grave but was recognized in him in the resurrection he said do you get it then the body of his believing children would not be held in the grave when he comes but we'll be recognized with him because he died for that purpose to resurrect his bride the body recognized because it was his holy body because it's his word amen and if you are a spoken word and I believe we're spoken words he spoke us before the foundation of the world then that makes you Unholy spoken word and that Holy spoken word unto him is his very life everything that he was he poured into Christ everything that Christ was he poured into the church and there's the bride standing here today with everything in her power recognized recognize our call in our placement yeah recognize our calling places three kinds of Believers by the way up says Joseph another believer he couldn't help being what he was he was a prophet God made him a prophet he didn't want to be different from his brothers but he was different God made him what he was nobody else could take his place nobody can take your place no matter how little you say he says I'm just a housewife nobody can take your place God in this great economy has set so forth that the body of Christ in order till there's no one that can take your place and I look around and you know I talk to especially talking to the youth and and how the youth thinking on they always think well you know I wish I could be a Eddie biscal I I wish I could be a Donny vegan I wish I could be a you name it God didn't call you to be them God called them to be them right God called you maybe to never speak a word in public God called you to maybe just live that life but nobody can take that brother Brennan said Moses couldn't tuck Jesus's spot the same way Jesus could have took Moses spot as much as Jesus was he couldn't have played Moses he had to find his place and you know I think so many times you know you look at you look at David and the example that he was in every aspect David got out of his call and it fell apart there's so many of us we do the same thing we get out of our call and we mess it up because we don't we we've got to recognize that it's not us doing it but it's him doing it through us and if he's called you to speak to 5 000 he'll make it happen you ain't got to try to make it happen you ain't got to sit down and write invitations to get them to come you ain't got to call them and beg them to come to church they'll be there because God's called you to fulfill that right if God's called you to sit on a few and pray for somebody you once you recognize you're calling your placement and I think of that I think oh God help us help us realize who we are help us realize what we're here for and what he wants us to do how many times has it been each one of us can tell testimonies God wake you up in the night to pray for someone they needed it they needed it and I think you know as uncomfortable as it may be sometimes for God to wake me up at 2 30 in the morning but I think you know what if I need prayer I'd like to know somebody will wake up and pray for me I pray for them and I thought of that and when was in Jamaica we hadn't I had an experience down there and I was two three four o'clock in the morning and when I get home my grandma told me I stayed up all night praying for you I thought that's how we make it through recognize God needs you God needs you right it says we can not believe we do not believe that we have the power Lord we just claim we claim to have authority he has all the power and once we recognize that but we recognize we have the authority to it we don't we don't do it we don't step out and do it ourselves we don't step out and say well I'll heal you and I'll do no we'll let him do it but the authority lies within us the bride of Christ not not the ministry not not the the bride of Christ has that Authority the same holy ghost that was in brother Brennan was in you Glory the same holy ghost that Jesus said he'll sin back is in you and I the same power and anointing is in you and I if we can just believe if we can just believe I said oh some way if I can get that message to him brother Brown and he says if you could only see Lord just realize wake them up Lord one more time tonight let them see you're the same God you're confirming your word you keep it just as you promised in the last days you said these things was happened and I thought I said you know he saw things he probably never saw or never said but look around us it doesn't take a genius to realize we're way up into revelation we'll come into a closing of time it's time a bride starts putting herself together and if you read Revelations 19 7 it says she puts herself together it says the script said let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is coming his wife has made her self ready God didn't come down and bull whip you into the corner and make you get dressed God didn't come down and say no I'm going to make you line up now God said here's my word you recognize who you are and you line up with it and he can't move until you recognize that you're that bride and you recognize who you are and I thought of that and I thought you know that she's like a marriage today if we want to have a marriage Saturday nobody has to warp that bride in the place to get her dress on because if she's obeyed God and she's kept herself clean and he's kept herself clean and they and they've lined theirselves up that they're going to a perfect marriage to a perfect ceremony to live eternity together and they're so in in love with each other that they just can't wait to spend eternity with each other nobody got to stand back then and make her get ready and she's probably pushing people out of the way yeah yeah right you're like look at my time y'all y'all had y'all's time it's my time to get up out of that altar and that man you know they may be a little nervous about him he's nerves anytime you get in front of people but you know what he ain't gonna stay in the back room or the front room in this case he he ain't gonna stay back there and say well Pastor I don't know if I'm ready to go or not you know I just he can't wait to get out there and most of them if it's anything like me and my wife we're looking at brother Carol we're like you heard this thing up you know we don't want to sit up here and talk all day you know we want to get married right right we want to start our life together we want to be with each other and I thought of the bride of Christ in that way we should be right if we recognize we're his bride we shouldn't we we don't want to wait any longer we don't want to struggle in this fight anymore we want to fight this world and all of its Temptations anymore well it'll be run into that altar we'll be running to that altar saying God take me God Take Me As I Am forgive me Lord Jesus take everything from me because I want to spend the rest of my life with you I want to spend the rest of my life with your Holy Spirit and my soul I want to spend everything every aspect of my life I want you to come into me and I want you to confirm this marriage and then I want you as we said yesterday be that Living God in Me I want you to live through me I don't want people to say where there's that there's that Jonathan Jones when you yeah we knew him no I wanted to look at and say man something happened that boy amen you know we had a we had at the church here a couple weeks ago with but Kyle was witnessing to a little uh fellow that was at the McDonald's we was eating and I asked him to come to church he come to church but Kyle okay I'll stop by and pick him up and I believe he's homeless and so he come to church and he come to church he seen one of the other brothers in church he goes oh God I know him I don't know and then after church he said something to him he says man I know where that guy come from he said that's something real here and I thought yeah that's that's what I want and God wants that too God wants us to recognize that we can't do it without him we can't do it without him it don't matter how long we've been in this thing if you've been in this thing 30 40 50 years if you leave God out of it you'll fail if you take God out of your life you'll be right back out there with them because this fleshly body is going to desire the things of the world and if there ain't a holy ghost here to keep it under subjection it's going to fail and if you don't keep him every day of your life you want to fail why do you think we see it in the message we think we grow up in the message and we think you know we hear the prophet talk about whether the Baptist whether the Pentecost whether method is and that's why we quote it because we quote the prophet but what about the message the message has got as many problems as the Baptist has got it right we the claim we follow this blessage has got as much issues as the Baptist has got we got as much marriage problems as the Baptist has got we got as much sin problem as the Baptist has got we got as much idolism as the Baptist he's got it we need God and we need God first in our lives we need God first in our hearts we need God first in our churches we need God first in our families and we need to look to him for everything that we ask and do because if not we become just another another ideal right another theology another great another great man that you know you know like that portray him you can go back and pick up old books and they're portrayed brother Branham as a as a general of faith and and and a great man of God and and a forerunner the faith healing and well that's all we become yeah but we're much more than that we're a chosen bride out of this chosen generation that's going to take that message and she's going to live it but first we got to recognize that's who we are right and I think of I think I think of one of the favorite one of my favorite quotes and he's in the church age book and he says and the and the reading says he knows talking about the devil he knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is she's done what she stands for then she can do Greater Works then she becomes an invincible Army I'm longing for that I'm longing for that I'm longing for the time that we can stand as a United bride and say there's my savior in the sky and he's coming to get me because you know I see in Revelations as as time closes out and we're closing out the book I see in Revelations where it says the bride says them that believe says even so come quickly that's when she's recognized who she is and she's had enough of living in this past house she's had enough of living in this world and she said Okay God we see we're her we're ready come now come now come now take us and I thank God help us to recognize that help us to recognize that right and I thought of that and is it there's a thought just kind of played in my mind last night I thought God what's it going to take for us to really recognize because I look around and I look all around us and I thank God I had a brother asked me one time because I I I read that quote which says she'll become the when she realizes who she is and he and his is an elderly and I'm not talking bad about the brother at all love him to death but he said well after this many years you don't think we realize we're the bride and I said no I don't know I said no I don't I said I think we have an intellectual conception that we're the bride but it ain't dropped here yet it ain't dropped here yet like brother Brenham said about that scripture on greater is he that's in me he said if we could get that Revelation nothing could stand before us if we could get that Revelation nothing could stand in our way we could walk out like Shem go and take all of the doubt down we could take all the sickness down he says in one place he says he said where Jesus was doubt had to flee where the bride is doubt has to flee he said when Jesus walked into the town people laying on the side fell in his shadows and raised up the bride should manifest the same thing because it's the same word of God in Jesus that's in the bride of Christ and if we can recognize who we are and we can recognize that them things that start happening we'll start coming around and we'll change atmospheres at work we'll change atmospheres and family get-togethers we'll change atmospheres because of who we are and because of what we are and who we stand for not not because of what this flesh is right because of the god that lives in us and when that God walks on the scene Devils have to flee demons have to flee sickness has to flee first we got to recognize we need him and you say well here I am I've been coming to this church for 20 years I've been coming here all my life but when's the last time you really got away with God what'd they say you know uh you know different ones they they go through there and they talked about uh back when I was a kid growing up they talked about John Elway quarterback of the Denver Broncos and all the great things he did Joe Montana and they said well now they're just living on their past I think as Christians we do the same thing we move for God so much and then we get happy and then we sit down and we say yep yep God's did this gods did this through me God's did this but what's he doing today what's he doing today because my kids they're never really fully grasped what the prophet did in the 60s because that's a century before them right right they're never fully grasped what my grandparents saw right they'll never fully grasp what my parents saw they need to see in me a living God they need to recognize that they have to have that same God I told my oldest daughter here and not not to talk not to put on the spot embarrass her nobody looked at her but I told her the other day I says you're 13. us as most people in the message anyway getting married 18 19 year old yeah I said that gives you five six more years under my roof and I says as long as you're here I'll I'll ensure that you're at church that you love God that you pray that you see us reading the Bible that you I said but Elizabeth what are you going to do when you leave here I can't make you live this life and we need to recognize we can't make our kids live the same life we do I look in the message and I look around our ranks and I think what have we done it's like we just expect them to grow up and believe this message and go on and I look around and I see a youth generation leaving I see them leaving we went to LA camp this year and had one of the best camps they said they've had in L.A their brother Tim told me all right but all of my group said that's the least we've seen there in years and I think what's happening we're not taking them back to the word and making them realize they need the same God I got I can't live for them I can't live for your kids you can't live for your kids they need God and they need a real God they don't need something they can say well you know you know I could sit here and say well I seen God do this in my papa and I seen God do this and no they don't do good enough we need recognize that our children needs to see a living God in their life what it what else can convince them if you want to stand musicians want to come what else can convince them that they need to serve this same God Amen than a life lived before but I had some wonderful parents my parents was wonderful raise me in this message taught me many things that I needed to know in life but how much more do I need to pray in front of my kids yeah how much more do I need to read the Bible in front of my kids how much more do I need to talk about God in front of my kids each and every one of us there's so much more we can do for our children instead of just hey we'll take him to church and we'll just we'll just put them into God now God put them into your hands as parents and he says God he said he said children here's you some children raise them under my likeness not under your likeness but raise them under my lightness and I think we fail that as parents right here pointing at myself we feel that amen we don't give our children enough God we can tell him that brother Branham said this and brother Brenham said that but what did you say because I can come to church and I can come up here and preach and I can look good well I don't know if that's possible but I can try to look good and then I can go home and the first time she does something wrong I can get angry yeah and she thinks hmm is that really him yeah or I can sit down with her and talk with her let's pray about this and I may still have to punish her I'm not saying no Punisher but we can pray about it together and then we can say you know what what you did was wrong that's punishment that comes with that but I still love you right right and God still loves you children no matter what you've did no matter what you stumbled on God still loves you and he may whoop you and he may punish him he's done me several times but at the end he's got his hand outstretched he said stand back up I'll put you back in the line of duty and I put you back to work something on your heart brother 683. that's 683 inspirable without him here I could do nothing foreign afternoon please please I would be nice with us thank God all God wants is us to get out of the ways Let Him Live let him live in our hearts in our lives away how about it Jesus I would be nice said all God wanted was one person in his hands one person he said that when the Bible do you want a Revival then let's start in you but our problem is we want to Revival in somebody else we want somebody else to do something instead of letting it start in me he needs the sound guard he needs a David in the last days well there's a lot of giants around children he needs you to I will Adventure anybody else want to come foreign time now see all God needs is somebody in his hands he just needs somebody to yield herself to to him the rest in him and he can take care of everything else don't win we try to fight our own struggles and battles instead of I'm just leaving it up to the Lord the Lord whatever like a share whatever it takes you come on the scene do it take away well you know I've never seen him fight all of you never seen him fail when I do it that way now if I try to fight my own battles and try to do her I mess up just wait on him and when he tells you to move you move because you know God a lot of times like the brother was quoting it was last night the prophet said he has to push me to get me to do see sometimes he wants you to just step out you step out on it what's the problem why can't we well I'm afraid of myself but don't worry about it you're already a failure born one but God takes failures and makes Heroes out of them all he needs is just us to believe without you my baby Jesus us but we can't make it without his name let's give our brother appreciate it amen appreciate him coming and being with us is the family coming and being with us we just count his family our family code has always been close and everything didn't know his family maybe as much but we knew her family she just part of us you know she's really I think she might even be a little kind of the day or somewhere

together and have a good time right father we thank you for the message today for my brother's heart and Lord we realize the realization that we don't have to worry about it all we got to do is just step out on what you tell us and just move when you say move and that way then we don't worry about the enemy of what he is and what's going on because it'll always be someone there to take care of it and father we ask you to just bless and guide our brother and his family as they travel back on today Lord and being home Lord and give a safe trip we pray that you'd bless him as he travels around

for that glorious day when Jesus shall come back I'm home saved the Broken Heart our pathway seems so long but he is never by my side he whispers loving orders to me and tells me to be strong that he will always lean and die Lord Jesus to come back
