is to see him amen we are living in a day and time where people are constantly talking about God and Desiring to see God and a prophet of God identified four ways to see him he said we'll see him in his word see him in his son see him in nature but the best one about it was we'd see him in his people amen and I believe this morning that we are his people amen that are called by his name and chosen uh chosen generation amen we greet you all today in the name of the Lord Lord how many's glad to be a Christian amen thankful to be saved and to know this morning that we're not uh on our way to hell but we're on our way to glory amen and we want to greet you all today in the name of the Lord we sure count it an honor and a privilege to be here with you once again and good to see everyone out in the house of God today and if you have your Bibles while you're standing we'll go into the scripture we want to turn to the book of St John uh the 16th chapter the book of St John the 16th chapter and I want to say thank you to brother Dale and brother Wade for the invitation to come and to be here once again with you all and I just pray the Lord would give brother Wade a save trip back home and amen I pray the Lord bless him on his trip and want to bring greetings from our church there at home our pastor brother Shawn Martin and the Saints there at Faith Tabernacle uh send their greetings to you and uh Mariah and the baby were supposed to be with us but I didn't realize that they had a sister's Thanksgiving lunch in yesterday so she was unable to make it but we also bring greetings from the family as well well and this morning we just want to look here in the word uh in the book of St John the 16th chapter I know that everyone here knows this verse by heart in the 13th verse of St John 16 just one verse the Bible says how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth now brother BR preaches a guide and he stops when he reads that and says all truth he says what is truth the word so he will guide you into all truth into all the word for he will not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak I love this and he will show you things to come brother BR said in other words he'll be the one that will reveal the thing that you see amen we ask Lord this morning to bless the reading of his word as we just bow our hearts together and humble our Spirits in his presence how we could just say Lord speak to me today amen Heavenly Father Lord As We Gather here on this Resurrection Sunday father we are well aware this morning that we are not here in this building by ourselves but oh God we recognize that your presence is here and Lord we stand here as a human being father with just human efforts Lord but father if we can get ourselves out of the way both speaker and hearer then Lord you can come into our midst and father as your Prophet told us you'll do things that we know nothing about oh God may you heal our sick this morning may you save the Lost father may you inspire Lord those that are down may you Lord encourage those that are discouraged oh God May strength and Revelation father May anointing fall upon the hearts of your children Lord and father I pray for those that have Lord come this morning with a question or a desire upon their heart Lord I pray you would help me to get myself out of the way that the people would not see me Lord but they would see you father and they would hear you oh God lord I pray that you would bless our brother Dale father bless this assembly Lord and father may you continue to bless them and give them Lord many souls for their labor oh God and Lord we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer says amen and amen may God richly bless you this morning you may have your seats here I I want to uh just to speak to you here for a few moments today uh from that passage of scripture in St John uh the 16th chapter the 13th verse uh where Jesus says when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth and I happen to believe amen that the spirit of Truth has come and is here among the church and I was listening to a tape the other day of the bomb in Gilead and the prophet of God said something that really just struck me he said when New Birth comes in it cannot come until there's a death first he said people don't want to die he said they don't want the simple leadings of the Holy Spirit he said they want to take their own thinking of it but you cannot than your thoughts you've got to thank his thoughts see then let this mind that was in Christ be in you amen he thanks God's thoughts brings God's blessings he said God's power to you and it'll make a mess out of you as far as the world is is concerned but it'll bring new life it'll bring resurrecting life it'll bring new thoughts it'll bring a new person it'll bring a new Faith he says it will bring you from death unto life so Amen in other words when the new birth comes in it's not going to be you bringing new thoughts or you bringing new ideas or you bringing yourself from Li from Death unto life amen but it will do it so it is not an idea it is not a tradition it is not a Creed amen but it is a person and that person is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ now when you start looking at this I want to speak to you this morning on that thought of simple leadings of the Holy Spirit the simple leadings of the Holy Spirit the prophet of God actually would pray this he said may it spread out through all the great Wills of God's economy that every church will have a Revival and the power of Christ shall surge through every church and every member until there's a Revival all up and down these valleys may it come again like it did years ago Lord bring forth the former and the latter rain together and may your people that's called by your name may they be revived again he said bring us back uh to the old time Pentecostal meeting Lord he said where the Holy Spirit can have the right away he said may we lay aside all of our learnings and just be simple people led amen by the holy spirit so that was the desire amen of the Propet of God is that we would lay aside amen everything that was contrary to the word of God in order to be a simple people amen that would be led by the Holy Spirit now you know as well as I that the prophet of God tells us that man amen was made to rely completely upon God he said see that's the reason we're liken unto Lambs or sheep a sheep cannot lead himself amen he has to have a leader and the Holy Spirit is supposed to lead us right amen so man is made that way and God made all of his works so simple that the simple could understand it now think about this amen that God made all of his works so simple that the simple could understand it and God makes himself simple with the simple in order to be understood by the simple that's a mouthful right there amen that God made all of his works so simple that the simple can understand it and God makes himself simple with the simple in order to be stood by the simple now it's been said that fools will walk with hobil shoes amen Where Angels Fear to Tred that's really true he said we walk over the simple things right he said we walk over God we walk over an orchid looking for a daisy he said and if we'll just simplify ourselves and get down how many could say Lord I don't want to be a complicated person I want to be a believer amen I don't want to be an educated person I just want to be a believer I love the way the prophet says it one time he says I don't want to be a smart man I just want to know him and I believe that's the real desire of every Born Again believer is not to be educated or to be intellectual or to be some great something but to be somebody amen that can recognize Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection and has become conformable unto his death through the fellowship of his suffering now amen I know that the Bible speaks of a falling away right it speaks of a turning back it speaks of a parting amen from revealed truth and I'll say it like this amen I believe that that will be a people amen who simply aren't able or they will lose their ability Amen to follow the simple leadership of the Holy Spirit now Jesus said it this way he said If any man will come after me then let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me said we must follow him amen is the only way to have eternal life amen so the leadership of God is this what it is follow the Vindicated word of the hour by the Holy Ghost amen the leadership of God is follow the Vindicated word of the hour by the Holy Ghost now we know this morning that the Son of God Amen was none other than the Lord Jesus Christ right and he was led by the spirit of God think of that the Son of God led by the spirit of God Amen the Bible says in Luke the 4th chapter that Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness amen so Jesus was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness amen Romans 8:14 says as many as are led by the spirit of God Amen they are the sons of God see amen so Jesus the son of God was led by the spirit of God and according to Paul in Romans 8 that the sons of God will be led by the spirit of God listen Len amen Jesus was not under one leadership and the sons of God under another but it was the same leadership amen all the way from Genesis to Revelation amen from 47 to 65 it was the same leadership and it was not the leadership of a man it was not the leadership of a bishop it was the leadership amen of the Holy Ghost that's why the prophet said amen the same holy ghost that led Simeon to believe amen is the same holy spirit amen that leads you to believe in Divine Healing he said there's no two Holy Spirits there's just one there's no two Holy Spirits there is just one do you realize the prophet of God would actually speak of a power amen that lays in the heart of the believer and he would say it's a power amen that you can actually speak a world into existence and go live a private life on it right amen he said see that's what power is in the church now amen but it is controlled by a law and the law is not a keeping of a bunch of Commandments amen it's a law of Faith Jesus said amen that all things are possible to them that believe how many believers do we have all things are possible to them that believe I love this brother Bob and if you can believe it then whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours if you can believe it then whatever God will leave your soul to believe that is yours every place the SCE of your foot can set upon by faith amen God gives it to you it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith it opens it to you if you are a son of God you are a daughter of God that never leaves you amen it's with you all the time he said you get away from it but it's still there then when you're on the mountain the law of faith is still there when you're in the valley the law of of faith is still there when you're shouting the law of faith is there when you're discouraged the law of faith is there amen when you're well the law of faith is there when you're sick amen the law of faith is there listen church amen we are not about bu a carnal commandment seeking people we are the Bride of Jesus Christ that has been anointed by the word of faith in this hour listen I don't know about you but I think it's time amen that we start taking some possession I think it's time we stop sitting back letting the devil tell us what we can have and what we can't what we can believe and what we can't we are not under the governship and tutorship of hell we are under the Tor ship of the Holy Ghost and we have been led to believe in Divine Healing we have been led to believe in miracles we have been led to believe that the Holy Ghost still takes possession of hearts and lives in this generation listen we're not we're what we're believing my I feel like preaching what we're believing we're not believing it because somebody talked us into it we're not believe in it because it's a religion we're believing it because our soul has been led to believe it amen listen we believe this message because the same holy ghost that led Elijah to preach it is the same holy ghost that has filled vessels in this age to believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours my then you're not flesh Christians you're Soul Christians are you hearing me you're not Spirit Christians alone on your soul Christians that's why you're here this morning I'm on we might as well preach amen last time I checked We're Not Angels last time I checked we'll never be Angels cuz we never was born to be Angels we're human beings right amen there's no angel wings here we're all humans listen if it was up to your flesh this morning you wouldn't be here if it was up to your spirit amen you wouldn't be here I remember I remember when I first started preaching I learned something real quick amen and you wake up on Sunday morning and it's sun shining outside and you go to church and everybody's on fire everybody's worshiping everybody's praising God I mean come on brother Bob the sun shining we got a reason to shout amen but wake up on Sunday morning let it be raining and cloudy and you go to church and people come dragging in and well I barely made it and there ain't much shouting he I tell you what that is that's people who are led by their spirit amen but if we're soul Christians amen we thank God that our soul has been led to believe amen that cloudy skies are no sign of God's disapproval amen and sunny skies are no sign of his approval amen but his approval is in his word and his word is in his bride and his love is bestowed upon you not because of the conditions of your life but because of the seed that was in your heart by the for ordination of almighty god listen we're not a bunch of Flesh Christians that serve God when everything's going good we serve him in the good times we serve him in the bad times amen that's why you're here this morning is because the deity on the inside of you is greater than the humanity against you come on Church the deity on the inside of you is greater than the humanity against you listen your flesh would told you this morning when that alarm went off you might as well sleep a little bit longer amen your spirit said well you've had a tired week and you've had a rough week amen you might as well just rest today but there was a soul in there there was a soul in there that said I got to get to the house of God I got to hear the word I got to fellowship with the Believers I've got to receive something from God what is that that is something in your soul that is leading you to believe I'll tell you what it is it is the leadership of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost will lead you to keep going when everything else tells you to quit the Holy Ghost will lead you to believe everything's going to be okay when everything else testifies it's falling apart because because it's the leadership of the Holy Ghost now when you look at this word simple I love the definition of this it means easily understood or done pretty simple right amen presenting no difficulty it is used to emphasize amen the fundamental and straightforward nature of something it is plain it is basic or uncomplicated in form in nature or design it is without much decoration or ornamentation now how many will agree that we are living in a world where everything is complicated we're living in a world where everything is complicated do you realize education is complicated government is complicated politics are complicated amen amen political systems are complicated I'm on the economy is complicated amen it used to be on on November or whatever that Tuesday in November you went to the polls you elected amen that evening you knew who won now it takes two months to find out who who cheated right amen it's a it's a time of complication it's a complicated time right amen and I'll say it to you like this what has not already been complicated just give it some time and it will be if they hadn't complicated it just give it a few more days and they will like used to be you had a refrigerator right you got water out of it you got ice out of it it had two doors but now you got to almost have a college degree to even get a glass of water out of it it because everything is complicated do you realize that same Spirit has come over into religion and the prophet of God will show you that organized religion took a simple word and made it complicated he said in the church age book he said the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people amen but God sent Luther with the word and the Lutheran spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost amen for organization tends amen towards dogmas and Creeds and not simple word the simple word was lost see they could no longer speak for God but then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day then the people who took his Revelation from God become living Epistles read and known of all men for their for their generation and when the Methodist failed then God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people somebody say another people there is another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age there is again another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age then do you see what it was it was a simple people in the beginning but when organization come in amen they confuse the word and complicate the word and they moved away from the word and the people become denominational but God promised to raise up another people I say it you like this another people is a simple people another people is a simple people look what Acts 15:14 says it says Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles Amen to take out of them a people for his name in other words God promised to call simple people God promised to identify the simple people I love what the prophet of God says he says I believe that you are risen from the dead how many believes that he's risen from the dead he said I believe he's risen from the dead 2,000 years ago and you are alive tonight and you are calling a simple people just as you always did out here amen one here one there no groups no Organization no great manners of what man had done but you said you would take a people out of of the Gentile there would be two in the field you would take one leave one there would be two in a bed you would take one leave one he said the people here and there for your name's sake the bride so in other words the bride is going to be made up of a simple people is this okay he says Heavenly Father through our hearts we will see the spirit moving among the simple people just plain simple people I'm afraid father that many of us Tre teachers he said has tried to make it too complicated for the people in our great day of learning that we are in now everything everyone smart educated spend all their time studying books so forth getting Scholarships in school learning science and literature and Mathematics he said and left out the Holy Spirit they they've got all this education and they've left out the Holy Spirit that's why they have no new births that's why they have no new Faith that's why they've not passed from Death un life that's why there's no promise of a resurrection am because he did not say that them things would come by education he did not say them things would come by religion but he did say that through the new birth it would bring new life it would bring New Faith it would bring New Hope listen friends I think it's time that we welcome back the holy ghost in the church I think it's time we welcome him back in the Pulpit come on now I think it's time we welcome him back in our altars I think it's time we welcom him back in our young people amen we can have all the education we can have all the learning but if the Holy Ghost is not in the church there will be no transformation if the Holy Ghost is not in the church there will be no change but if the Holy Ghost comes He will draw out a simple people that will love him and who will believe him listen I tell you what a simple people is there are people that believes God can do anything regardless of the conditions they believe God can do anything amen I love what the Bible says how that they reason among them El and they said we've taken no bread in the Book of Matthew and he said like this oh ye little faith why reason ye among yourselves because you have brought no bread do you not understand neither remember the Five Loaves or the 5,000 how many baskets you took up neither the seven loaves or the 4,000 how many baskets you took up how is it that you do not what understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread but that you should be aware of the Le of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees he said then they understood they how that he B them not be aware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees what did the Pharisees and Sadducees do they laid aside the simple leadings of the almighty God and instituted things in its place that brought confusion upon the hearts of the people the prophet of God was asked a question what did Jesus mean in Matthew 16 what do the 12 12 baskets and the Seven baskets represent he said in other words like this if you've seen God provide and do a miracle then can he do a miracle again if you've seen him do one Miracle then can he do a miracle again in other words if he saves you from a life of sin can he not heal your body don't you remember when you was a sinner how he lifted up your soul and Faith to believe can he likewise do something great for you again see remember when they crossed the Red Sea God opened the way like and made the Red Sea open like that and walk through he come right on the side and as soon as he got without water they started murmuring as soon as they got without bread they started crying we don't have no bread he said didn't you consider the miracle back there at the Red Sea when they all got in a spot by the Red Sea oh they said we ought to have died here comes the Egyptians right on us now here it is what are we going to do said who smoked the Earth with plagues down there who kept the sun shining in Ghost and see we must remember these things remember that God is God we must remember these things remember that God is God listen to this and any of it he's still God and he certainly can do anything we must remember that God is God and he can do anything they say it to you like this a simple people simply believes a simple people simply believes there was a story one time told of a man he walked in a store and they said sir what are you he said well I'm a Believer they said well why are you a Believer he said because I believe they said well why do you believe he said because I'm a Believer they said well no you don't understand what makes you a Believer he said because I believe he said well what makes you believe he said because I'm a Believer see there's no way to get away from who you really are if you're a doubter of God's word you'll always doubt his word but if you are a believer of God's word then there's something higher than your flesh there's something higher than your spirit there's something called the holy spirit that is leading your soul to believe now what did Jesus say he said if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth see I'll tell you what the prophet said he said Noah was a simple believer I love that Noah was a simple believer he was preaching a go goel that was out of line to the way of believing he said it was simply crazy that they could scientifically prove that there was no rain there but this simple sheep herder believed God said it would rain and it would rain he said just compare that with today when somebody gets healed well they say it's only emotion or I can scientifically prove to you that the cancer or the substance or the thing is still there but to the simple believer it's gone to the simple believer it's gone see because he's not looking at the substance he's looking at the promise said like this he said I lay my hands upon this sister may she have the attitude of the SAR Phoenician woman may she be healed in Jesus Christ's name he said let the heart be well let the heart be well in the name of Jesus Christ I speak those words it has to be well it can't be anything else Jesus said I can if you believe now if he can make a squirrel appear like that he did a Ram one time then he can make that heart appear normal and well has to be in the name of Jesus Christ let the heart be well he says Now isn't that simple it is simple God is so simple now listen you'd just be simple enough not to even think about it anymore if God pronounces healing upon a situation the prophet of God is inviting you to be simple enough to believe it's over amen it'll be all right I love how he talks about in the message make the valley full of ditches remember he talks about that that Indian man and they said he brought him his father to brother R's meetings to be prayed for and he packed him across the river on a stretcher imagine that amen this boy packs his father on a stretcher across the river to be prayed for in a meeting and brother said I said are you afraid you'll take pneumonia he said no Jesus Christ take care of me bring my father said oh that's it I said you believe I asked Jesus to heal your father heal him yep that's why I brought him I love that kind of confession I said pass him on by and as he went by I laid my hands over on the old man I said dear God an old ancient father here laying here old crippled up shaking with py I said have mercy upon him and heal him I pray in Jesus name I said now take him on as you believe so will it be amen amen as you believe so will it be I brought another one on the next one coming just so tired I can hardly stand there I heard somebody screaming going on looked and the old man on the board on his shoulders going on waving at everybody like that just that simple but you try to figur it out how it happens that's the reason you miss it that's the reason you miss it they just simply believe I love how the prophet shows us that when blind marus got healed he did not try to figure out who was passing by he believed on him who was passing by when Jesus stopped he did not move upon the beggar's voice he did not move upon the beggar's emotion he moved upon the beggar's Faith right it was by blind bardus is faith that actually stopped Jesus dead in his tracks I'll say to you like this a simple confession of faith can go a long way a simple confession of faith can do a lot of damage to the devil Devil's Kingdom now you see you see in the Bible how that Jesus spoke in a way that the common people could understand and could receive him gladly in The Book of Mark the 12th chapter it said David therefore himself calleth him Lord and whence he is then his son and the Common People heard him gladly said Jesus talked with such a simple language with a simple people and was written likewise he said they're trying but those great big swelling out stand then hold on to Dear hold on for dear life as I call it words they miss it it was wrote so simple correct so simple as it was to bring the gospel to the poor and needy he said The more simpler you can get the higher God will raise you the more simpler you can get the higher God will raise you you realize we got men that that go to schools for 10 and 15 years to become preachers and doctors of divinity and around this message God has taken country boys and and backward people and has raised them up to preach the message of the a you know why amen because they didn't have nothing to begin with they weren't worried about Prestige they weren't worried about social standing but they had a burden to preach the word and God honored the simple Faith come on church I tell you this if you want to rise amen lay aside the way you think things are and submit yourself to the way the prophet said things are and God will take you from nowhere and put you somewhere come on Church we're not following a God that needs the support of denomination he just needs a simple heart who will believe him regardless of the condition simple people never question the word of God are you hearing me simple people never question the word of God educated complicated people well they read what brother said and they swell you know we need to break this down and put this in and take that out somebody ask me one time they said brother Andrew where does your Liberty come from from where does your Liberty come from when you're preaching I said My Liberty comes from the ignorance of my Humanity to be able to say Amen to what a prophet taught whether I can explain it or not he said it I'm going to preach it come on church I think if we're going to believe this message we ought to quit dissecting it and trying to break it down under some educational approach and say it the way a prophet said it if a prophet said it take the gloves off and say what he said and back the devil off of the church and let the liberty of the Holy Ghost fall in the midst of his people and bless them and heal them and raise them listen I'll just tell you what I believe I believe this message is the truth I believe what a prophet taught is the truth I believe you do too so stand behind it you realize sometimes you got to stand with this message when you can't explain it absolutely sometimes you got to stand with this message when you can't explain it but if you'll stand with it the oh God if you'll stand with this message amen it'll pay off in the end right what are you saying I'm saying if you'll stand with it when you can't explain it right if you'll stand with it when it goes against your Pentecostal teaching well praise God anyhow it's the message so we stand with it regard less of our education we are a simple people who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age I love what Proverbs 14:15 says it says the simple believeth every word but The Prudent man lookth well to his go remember said those simple people they never question they don't question they see something done and that settles them every one of them he said you should never question the word of God that's what got the whole human race in trouble is when Eve questioned whether God would keep all of his word or not and I say tonight Brethren it's come time that we must believe every word that God wrote It's come time that we must believe every word that God wrote see every bit the truth you realize in order to believe now can I have some Liberty here in order to believe sometimes you've got to lay a some things in order to believe something sometimes you've got to lay aside some things you know I just I I I know brother Bob can handle it so I'm going to pick on him but if somebody if somebody told me they said you know they said brother Bob he's a he's a he's a crooked guy you better stay away from that guy don't fellowship with him don't talk to him he's a crooked old guy just stay away from him well you see they've told me that and so now I've come to believe that amen but if I really get to know brother Bob then I know that's not not what he is so in order to believe he's a good man a clean living man a loving man that believes his word and loves the Lord I've got to lay aside what somebody else told me about the man in order to believe the truth about it come on church and people have said stuff about this message for years they said well you can't quo this and well brother BR didn't mean that and that's why you got young people sitting in churches today that don't know if they've got the holy ghost or not they're in a faith crisis amen but I say this if if you can lay aside everything that's been taught contrary to what a prophet taught and let a message take preeminence in the church it'll Elevate the young people it'll Elevate the elders it'll raise your faith to a place to believe I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God I am redeemed I am saved I am Sanctified I am filled with the Holy Ghost are you hearing me you got to lay aside some things in order to believe something now the pr of God said go back to the beginning therefore if we're going to talk on the church age we've got to go back to the beginning if we're going to talk on the church age we got to go back to the beginning he said listen laying aside every statement laying aside every statement that man has said down through the age forgive me are you hearing me if you're going to lay aside something you got to lay aside all of it yes you say well brother Andrew can we hold on to a little 11 a little 11 leav of a whole lump that's right that's why the prophet of God said you can't mix Pentecostalism with this message this message will not mix it's an unadulterated pure genuine spoken word Original Seed message the prod of God shows you in the church age book amen that God God's people are simple people who are caring for truth rather than wealth they're caring for truth rather than wealth do you realize what a simple person is it's a humble person amen amen and a humble person according to the Bible is the one that inherits the promises in Genesis 18:17 the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham the thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him Jesus said in Matthew 5:5 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the Earth how many says Lord I want to be a Meek person blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth I I had a teacher in school bless her heart sister Turner she'd said like this she'd say Amen the Bible said be meek but it show didn't say nothing about being weak I said you know what I kind of like that because if you're not careful the devil will make you so meek and so humble he'll make a ragd doll out of you now you might as well face it it's got to a time now where if a man gets behind a pull pit and takes a sword to a spirit he's got the wrong Spirit he don't have the right Spirit he don't love a I tell you what that is that's a denominational spirit that come out of the pits of hell that doesn't want the spirit of Truth to lead the church he wants a personality to lead the church he wants a direction to lead the church but I have not been called Amen to uphold traditions and to uphold personalities but when he the spirit of Truth called me he said preach the word and anything against that word ought to have a sword taken come on church are you hearing me we're in a battle friends we're in a battle for truth we're supposed to be meek but we're not supposed to be weak we're not supposed to back up the spirit and I'll tell you what happened you back up to one spirit and you'll have 10 before you know it well we're we're heing it's Sunday morning and I feel good amen you let one devil in before long you'll let 200,000 in you let one evil spirit in before long it'll take over the whole entire church are you hearing me that's why America's in the condition she's in today it's CA a bunch of spineless cowards invaded officers without a backbone to stand against anything well you know it's the truth I guess it's the avanza coming out this morning you know what the truth 5050 years ago gay marriage was not condoned from the White House you know why because there was some people there that had backbones that still believed a man ought to marry a a woman and a woman ought to marry a man they didn't believe a man and a man ought to marry and try to raise a child but today that's that that's that's uh uh uh it's congratulated and it's sponsored from the White House well it's the truth anyhow because it's an age of Toleration it's an age where nobody's wrong everybody's right nobody body's idea ought to be checked well I happen to believe anything contrary to this message being promoted from the message pull pit ought to be checked by the spirit of Truth well brother so and so I don't care who it is if it's against the truth and the simple leadings of the Holy Spirit the spirit of truth will check it it's an age of Tolerance it's an age where everything's okay amen and so you let down one standard and before long you let down another and another and come on now you know it's the truth it's it's all over America it's all over the government come on but there would be a bride in the end time who would not be letting down the standard she would actually be the standard are you hearing me what does the Bible say when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord will raise a standard against him and the spirit of the Lord is in the Bride come on and the standard of the Lord is his word and the word is the plum line it's the plummet of the church a man's idea is not the plum line of the church but the word is the plum line the word is the standard that I say it's come time that the word would have preeminence in every Ministry in every family and every marriage let the word of God have the preeminence for that word will make you a Meek believer and the meek shall inherit the Earth You Know The Prodigy said like this he said right now he said they're they're arguing over who's going to get this and they're going to get Russia who's going to get this who's going to get that he said funny thing is he said we all get it amen are you hearing me how many in here's got a mortgage anybody four of you good Lord what's in the economy in Georgia how many pays rent mortgage okay do you realize what you're doing do you realize you're paying a mortgage or rent on land you already own the Bible says the meek shall inherit the Earth come on the Bible says that the wicked amen will become ashes and the righteous will walk out only ashes of the wicked were they going to walk out on the ashes of the Wicked on not on Pluto not on Jupiter but up on the earth come on out of all the planets out of all the solar system tell me which one is named in the book of redemption Pluto's not there and Jupiter's not there and Mars is not there but the word Earth is there because Psalms 24 says amen that the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof then come on Church you're living on an earth in earth oh God hallelujah you're living on the earth in Earth that's under a claim of redemption your soul has already been redeemed but there's a flesh body that's going to be redeemed one day and your body is going to match your soul and the Earth you're standing upon it's going to be washed away it's going to be cleansed by fire and that New Jerusalem which is the bride is going to descend upon this Earth as a spotless bride of Jesus Christ come on church amen this is not a bunch of complicated doctrines and Creeds it's a person it's the simple leadings of the Holy Spirit by the spirit of truth I pray this is okay the Blessed ones are the meek ones and the meek ones shall inherit the earth I love this Jesus said blessed are the are the meek I love the way brother interprets this the simple ones he said the ones that don't try to make some great big something shall inherit the earth Jesus said said so now they polluted it and God will destroy them but Fami will inherit the earth right after it's been purified so God will actually hide the secrets from the wise ones because they're the ones that have polluted the Earth destroyed the Earth but he will reveal it to the simple ones yes the meek in spirit and they will inherit the Earth are you hearing me like can I preach it's like people tell you you know I was just out in Canada the other day it's a funny thing right now I was out in Saskatchewan last weekend and you go in a store now you can't get a plastic straw right you can't get a plastic straw you know why because all of a sudden now after hundreds of years of using it plastic is horrible for the environment so some wise person sit down and said said we don't need to use plastic no more we need to use paper so here's what we're going to do we're going to invent paper straws because they got an education I mean they know more than just some simple old farmer over here on the back side of Saskatchewan I mean they they've got all this education so now they got paper straws well let me tell you this go in a restaurant the other day and a kid's using a paper straw and the thing melts and the kid chokes on it so it's a complicated age where the where the eyes are saying the simple are destroying the Earth but in reality the simples are the ones that's going to inherit the earth I I pray I wish I was a preacher this morning are you hearing me the wise are destroying it amen saying the simple are the ones destroyed but the simple are the one who have come under the voice of redemption to the seventh angel and they are the ones that will inherit the earth the Propet God said God will not hide these secrets from the simple ones all this mystery is revealed only as he promised to his bride hell is against the truth of the revelation of this mystery amen but the bride is standing on it and who is the bride she is the simple ones she is the another people she is The Blood Bought redeemed Sons and Daughters of God and she will be standing on the Revelation that all hell is against that's her stand he said why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal the hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of the world you let some Pastor you let somebody get it out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're hungering and you're thirsting it's God trying to reveal it to you see the Revelation the last day is here yes it is then pray tell me without this message we're else does the bride have to stand brother Bob without this word where else does the bride have to stand without this message where else can Faith rest upon without this message where else can we put our feet and say all hell may sell against me but I will not back off of this without this message I'll tell you what this message is it's a sure Rock it's a sure Foundation it's not a sliping stone it's a stepping stone it's a it's not a rock of offense to the bride it's the Cornerstone it's the place she stands when all hell is against her it's the place she stands when devils are trying to encroach up on her right she stands there as a bride who's under the revelation of the word and the age that she's living in listen Church the prophet of God likened you unto a little girl out in Oklahoma who the armor son came out there looking for a bride you remember that he said he went out there looking for a bride he said now watch he wrote out there I love this story brother Michael Le said they heard that there was a rich man coming to town looking for a wife right he said so they got out there and he said they got all ready can I preach to you in other words they complicated things they got all ready they went and bought the best dresses and the newest makeup and the newest Fashions and got the newest haird amen but there was one little old simple girl there was one little old simple girl over there who didn't have the fancy dress she didn't have the fancy makeup and the the the the man's son come riding into town and when he rode in there all them women went out there I believe they probably use it this way he said they went out there trying to Vamp him they were trying to get his attention he said and they was out there flaing around he said but that didn't get his attention because he wasn't looking for that he was looking for character he was looking for character right he said now watch he said when that when that armor son rode into town he said they were all out there carrying on he said but there was one little old girl and what was she doing she was carrying out dishwater Amen to the to the to the trash pile or to the trash whatever and was pouring dirty dishw water out I often preaching like this she was pouring out denominational dishwater she was out there pouring out denominational dishwater she had had enough of it she was sick of it she had been serving them cousins she had been serving that she'd been serving that tradition for years and when he saw that he said there's a woman that I want to marry and want to raise a family with right now listen to this the Bible said let us be glad and rejoice amen give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready said there she was getting herself all ready now notice this he told her he said now listen I'll return for you I want to marry you I'll return for you and he said when I return for you he said I'll take you home with me he said see you know what as he got closer the more critical her cousins got they said now listen I love the way he says this they said you poor little simpleminded thing right do you mean to tell you that that armor son would marry somebody he would marry somebody like us somebody who would fit in his Society somebody who had education who had some glamor about them see what's the what's the church thinks today but how far off they are how way off they are listen he was not looking for glamour that's right right he was not looking for society he was looking for character he was looking for virtue right amen are you hearing me he was looking for somebody who would be his wife he was looking for somebody brother Bob that would reflect what he was he was looking for somebody and brother B said she was simpleminded he said and when the little cousins got to making fun of her I love this Heen he said now watch he said he left and for two years he was away and for two years he she was criticized she was made fun of she was ridiculed she was ostracized amen but you know when the real criticism come you know when the real criticism come is when she put the wedding garment on God when she put the wedding garment on is when the real criticism come because now it is moved from just a confession into an action she has now amen joined her confession into a manifestation glory to God and she's put on the wedding garment and the little cousin her ha haa and they're laughing and making fun of her but she took her stand upon the word that he would return again and pick her up come on church that devil right now is laughing at you he's doing everything he can to stop you he's doing everything he can to destroy your faith but I tell you why he's doing that it's because you stepped into the wedding garment you are dressed in the wedding garment you are dressed in the Robes of his righteousness his word is upon you you are a word bride so your wedding garment is the word the devil's not criticizing you cuz you got more money in the bank now come on chur the devil's not fighting you cuz you got more members than you had 10 years ago he's fighting the people who's put the wedding garment on that's right because now when you put it on Comes The Challenge not to spoil your skirts of Purity well that's a truth anyhow are you hearing me she was was simple-minded but she believed what he said I love this brother Bob he said like this he said for all those years the only thing she could tell him was he promised amen that's all right sister Dale you imagine she got up on Monday morning and was doing the chores and they was laughing at her and she said he promised Wednesday night is time to go to church and as's making fun of her she's on her way out to the door to church said he promised come home Wednesday night they's all making fun of her she walked through the door he promised for two years she beat down criticism mockery by this confession but he promised oh God I tell you what some of y'all need to do right now you need to take that same confession and beat that devil of anxiety down you need to beat that devil of fear down you need to beat that devil of of of nervousness down come on Church you got a promise come on he was a fallible man with a finite mind with limited resources he promised he would return but what if the wheel fell off of the wagon on his way to pick her up what if he fell over with a heart attack on his way to pick her up come on listen you are not here telling the devil he promised to find out man but the infallible god with the infallible word through the inexhaustible Fountain of his Spirit has promised you that some morning between 6:00 and 9 I'm going to Rapture you out of this Leon come on church and we're just simple enough to believe it he said how many would like to see God he said see then the Simplicity of it just confuses the great powerful intellectual mind that tries to make him some great something that he's not he's here with us he's God he's part of you yes he's a fiber of you right Mercy he's here he's a part of you who are you talking about he who promised where the Flesh of his flesh amen and the bone of his bone we're a part of him cause we're his children amen amen oh God can I have a few minutes here we're his children then can I ask you something his children will reflect his nature that's right that's it his children will reflect his character sir his children will act the way he acts sir now listen it won't be a manufactured manifestation it will be from a DNA that's right come on it's like it's like your son my little boy it's funny he'll he looks like me how come my DNA is in him are you hearing me my DNA is in him he can't act like something else come on church that's why you're here as a Believer this morning because somebody didn't talk you into it there was a DNA in you to believe yes sir the Lord right there was a strain so what happens then in Jesus he was not a puffed up oh Lord arrogant he was a humble yes simple man of God Son of God with the very DNA of God in him now I love this part brother says it like this he said see humble thyself you imagine that tape powerful tape go listen to it he said I was thinking here of an illustration to back up what he said we take this watch we find out what time it is unless every instrument in that watch is coordinating one with the other will never know the correct time amen unless every instrument in that watch is coordinating with one another we'll never know the correct time that's right that takes all of us oh help us put on your seat belts all together if we want to see the third pool really do something for God it's coordination with every every one of us together to Humble ourselves before God confess our wrong pray and believe God for these things so what he's saying then is God can only operate as we let him operate he said you know people want power and really they don't know what power is they don't really know what goes with it the way up is always down if you want Power see how humble you can get he said you show me a church that's humble real humble not arrogancy a church just a sweet Humble Church I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it that's right humbling ourselves before God letting God work through us the man that humbles himself in is the man that God exalts he said we want to keep everything running smoothly and sweetly and an order for the Lord he said see gifts are so great what we call power but Paul said though I have faith I can move a mountain have not charity I am nothing think of it though I understand all the mysteries of God see and still I could do it and Have and Have Not charity I have nothing see I ain't got nowhere yet the main thing is love God right yes humble yourself with it now surely after all these years now can I read this to you he said surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing IND different people I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in at amen are you ready for this yeah can I I I want to labor here for a second and if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit ever come around you if you really want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit come around you don't let No Malice come in no matter what anybody does if they're wrong oh my don't you never build up a complex against that person see you be sweet and kind amen glory to God I guess the rubber is hitting the road now ain't it don't you never build up a complex against that person you be sweet and kind yes sir well bless God brother I want to give him peace in my mind you be sweet and kind Hallelujah that's right am right well Glory you remember God loved you when you were in sin and if the spirit of God is in you you love the other person when he's wrong you just pray for them love one another everything love God love one another and be humble with God and around one another and God will bless us are you ready for this it's hard telling what he will do right amen yes when you humble yourself when you love God when you love one another oh yeah you mean these are ingredients to the third pool you mean this is actually connected to the third pool humility the right Spirit yes right that's right see as we grow closer to God we we do it by humbling oursel Jesus said whosoever shall exalt himself shall be a based and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted I love what Peter says he said humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time humble that word means to bring into a humble condition to have a modest opinion of oneself brother now I've met some people and their opinion of themsel is far from Modest amen their clothes might be but their opinion sure ain't are you hearing me well you see the way the Lord revealed it to me and the way God showed me and come on now but the Bible says if you want to see more of the third pool humble yourself for he that will humble himself God will exalt can I ask you this you tell me another man on the face of the earth that could have seen the things that William Bram saw was a part of the miraculous Supernatural man manifestation that he was a part of come on now I'm talking about amen around the world seven times yes amen right around the world seven times in jungles in South Africa in a hotel room and they call him and say now come on Church come on preachers preach with me now amen amen amen in a hotel room and the the host Pastor calls and says open your window and look outside and he opens the window and there goes seven jump truck full of wheelchairs and stretchers and Cs and crutches and all kinds of things I know some preachers had walked out there and said well bless God look what the meeting man I tell you what woo glory for the next 10 years of meetings all you had ever heard is I preached in South Africa and there was seven come on it's I'm preaching you know it's the truth amen but a prophet said if you want to see more of that the more humble you get get you know why that it grew greater is because when he saw that it didn't exalt him it humbled him that's why he could go from there Down to Georgia Carter's house and she would get up off the bed that's why hadie R could be on the other side of the wall her boys and her hear about a prophet speaking squirrels into existence come on Church you know it's the truth amen I know men that's had one miracle and for 50 years they promoted one Miracle well it's the truth sir and that's all it's about is them but according to the Bible a simple people will be a humble people who will not exalt themselves or their knowledge will exalt Christ and one Miracle LED to a greater Miracle LED to and brother brother Michael at the end of William bram's Ministry he could come down to the end and say these words well it wasn't me I was just standing there when he come by see no I'm not the son of man I'm a son of man revealing the son of man but it's not my voice it's just what I lended my voice to are you hearing me he was in position under the word what are you saying preacher I'm saying this friends Jesus Christ has returned to human flesh in the bride to manifest the same nature the same characteristics the same Temperance the same patience come on church it's more than just a bunch of puffed up head knowledge of intellectualism reading charts and quotes it's a life lived every day it's a it's a salty life it's a life that is reflecting it's reflecting the very nature of God and that is drawing people closer to God the Bible said he being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient even unto death even the death of the Cross are you ready for this he became lower than his creation direct quote he became lower than his creation who's just creation he became lower I pray this is okay then his creation that he he might redeem man listen who was homeless and helpless and give them a home in heaven he left the glories of Heaven he left the highest name that could ever be called and when he was on Earth man gave him the lowest name that they could give him said he was an illegitimate baby start with born in a manger wrapped in rags of the back of the Yol of an ox no place to go had no home to go in and was called be elub the chief of the Devils he was mistreated I know we may not be shouting but it's the truth anyhow he was spit on he was made fun of he was rejected he went to the lowest pits stooped to the viest of prostitutes that's what man done to him right that's right man brother Bob gave the highest God the lowest name but can I turn that and closing but God raised him up so high that he has to look down to even see Heaven oh God man gave him the lowest seat give him the worst place the lowest name but God raised him up and give him the highest seat and the highest name that's the difference what man done with the Son of God and what God done with the Son of God he stooped listen he I want to preach a message on this sometime he stooped that we might be lifted we were homeless church we were helpless and he stooped that we might be lifted he become us that we through his grace might become him he come to the homeless and became homeless himself that we might have a home he came to the sick and was made sick himself that we might be healed he came to the Sinner and was made sin himself that we might be saved he had a home and he gave up his home that we would have a home are you hearing me this morning how many can say Lord I want to be a simple believer a simple believer to Simply accept what God has done for me in this generation what are you saying preacher I'm saying thank God for sending a humble Prophet who took the simple word that has been complicated for years and would uncomplicated to the people and would actually reveal the entire key to the word and say here it is Simplicity is the key key to the word Simplicity is the key to the word you realize this morning friends he laid aside all his Splendor laid it all aside to come down to a homeless helpless people I say this morning friends may we never get so arrogant may we never get so revelated and so educated and so intellectual that we can't humble ourselves and walk under the spirit of truth how many can say Lord lead me and I'll follow guide me and I'll go show me and I'll believe it I'm following you Lord let our musicians come this morning follow me and I'll go Lead Me Lord guide me you know it's amazing the prophet of God takes that John 16 it's a beautiful tape if you get to listen to it he calls it a guide and in John 16 he'll actually say it like this he said see he said what happened was he said you can't go nowhere even in Canada to hunt he said unless you take a guide with you right he said you got to have a guide he said now see what a guide is is a guide is responsible for you he said that God has got to see that you don't come up missing he's got to see that you don't come up lost he said that guide has got to see that you get back where you come from safely now you know something's actually funny to me I was talking to a God one time at a hunting show y'all forgive me I enjoy hunting but I was talking to him I said I said sir I said uh you do guid and professional he said yeah I said just tell me a little bit about it he said well he said the number one issue with guiding I said let me guess and I had all these things in my mind you know this is the number one issue he said the number one issue with guiding is is people that you're guiding shows up and thinks they guiding you I said really he said yeah he said the the number one issue we have is we got guides that we've trained and we've paid and they know and he said guys show up and they're trying to guide the guides he said we got a little say and here's what we say did you pay us or did we pay you he said when you remind them how much money they spent he said then they you know they kind of quiting down and start falling you but he got to tell me had a guide one time he said this guy got out there and he said like this he said I told him I said now here's the weapon to bring here's the gun to bring he said here's what to do he said okay yeah okay and he showed up with everything opposite of what the guy told him to bring so he gets out there in the woods and the GU well he said now I'll tell you this I mean a very a very smart guy he's telling us he said he said like he said I know I pray this is okay amen I'm going somewhere he said I know when you're out there he said especially up here in the snow he said you can look for tracks and he said when you see certain tracks he said you can actually identify just about the weight of the deer and all and this guy's knowledgeable and he said so what you do is you start following these tracks you know and he said well this guy I'm guiding him and he said I found some tracks and I said now here's what we're going to do and he said now you just follow me and he said he just kept on going and kept on going he said for long he turned around the guy wasn't back there and he said I'm looking around I'm thinking it's it's pure white out here he's got orange on and I can't see him nowhere he said where's he at he said that night he showed up at the cabin and when he got the cabin he said man where you being he said well I got to look at a around out there and he said man I saw some tracks here I saw some tracks there and I got to follow them tracks and I tell you what I got over here and he said but you know what he said I got over there and it was nothing but a bunch of squirrels he said you mean you followed them tracks all that far he said yeah he said I'm going home he said why are you going home he said this place ain't got no deer this place ain't got no deer whatsoever he said it ain't got nothing it's a waste of time about that time another guy brought a guy in off the same hun who was carrying a trophy and that guy looked at him and said see if you'll just stay behind your guide that's the result amen if you'll just stay behind the one that's been trained that's the result come on Church what are you saying I'm saying we never took a Rapture before we never took a resurrection before but there's a prophet Among Us who is laid in the presence of the son and his word he may be gone but the word is still here and it was not a man it was the word and the spirit of Truth is the word and the word is the spirit of truth and the word is the guide if you lay aside the way you think you can get home if you lay aside the way you think you can work it out and just humble yourself and no matter how contrary it is to the way that your grandpa grandma taught you about deer hunting right stay behind the guide right he's been trained and you'll become a trophy of his grace amen won you to stand to your feet with us this morning it's real simple it's real simple follow the God Amen the god he's responsible for you that's right he'll take care of you amen he'll see that you don't come up missing remember brother B said I got out there and he said I got on that death walk and he said I got to go in in circles he said here I was I'd been a God and he said I thought I could figure out on my own and you know this morning I know I'm going a little bit long but you give me Grace but you know this morning I find out what we got brother Michael we got a bunch of people sitting in churches doing the death walk they're going in circles amen going in circles around and around and around and around and around and around and brother said he said I hung that deer up and he said I thought oh God I got to get out here and he said I got to go and he said before I come back around he said well there was the deer and I was back here and he said you know what happens he said they wear themselves out that might be why people can't stay stay awake in church no more they're wore out they're trying to figure it out they're trying to break this down and put this together and make sense out of this and figure out why B said that way and why we can't call I mean it's just just wore out but I love the way he says this he said but the very minute I raised my hands I surrendered to the guide and he said when I did he said my hand touched the wire that's right amen he said my hand touched the wire he said and I got a hold of it brother Bobby said I got a hold of it and he said I wasn't turning it loose for nobody he said because I knew that that line would lead me back to everything that was dear to my heart on the earth he said no matter who told me to take my hands off of it he said I wasn't turning loose of it and I wonder this morning is there anybody here that says Lord I'm tired I'm wore out but today I want to surrender amen I want to get a hold of that line and I want to follow that line I don't want to take my hands off of it I want it to lead me back to everything that's
