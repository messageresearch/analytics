[15:01] this one's anointed it releases doesn't
[15:03] been using it if you just go right ahead
[15:12] Louisiana camp when well we drove to
[15:16] Louisiana and at first we didn't go to
[15:19] the morning services because our hotel
[15:21] was literally an hour away so we just
[15:25] went to the evening services so the
[15:27] evening services were amazing I really
[15:29] like them I just they're amazing
[15:32] so Saturday nights have always been my
[15:36] favorite because they have the prayer
[15:39] line and I love the prayer line so as
[15:42] soon as you go in and start crying um
[15:46] all right uh I kind of just felt like it
[15:51] was amazing so because I liked it so
[15:54] much I went in twice and I don't think
[15:56] you're supposed to do that
[16:00] [Applause]
[16:02] but I went in anyways so the second time
[16:06] I went in it was a the same thing but a
[16:12] lot better so going into the prayer line
[16:15] I felt like st. Anne was telling me put
[16:17] your hands down
[16:18] don't lift them up but I just kept
[16:21] pushing lifting them up amen yes amen
[16:25] it's alright
[16:30] sorry okay so coming out of the first
[16:57] time then I felt like I should just go
[17:00] back in because God was like telling me
[17:02] that I needed this and I didn't want it
[17:05] to end because it was just so amazing so
[17:14] the first year that I went to camp I
[17:17] just couldn't stop crying and this year
[17:19] I couldn't stop crying for a longer time
[17:22] amen
[17:25] so I just believe that I kinda got
[17:29] something out of that and yeah
[17:37] yeah I just got like God just told me
[17:42] yes that I needed it and the devil
[17:46] couldn't do anything about it yeah
[17:47] that's right
[17:48] amen Navin thank you
[17:55] that's all she was shy who thought that
[18:00] girl was shot Olivia then asked her then
[18:09] my two brother bless you today I want to
[18:21] thank poppy and the church for letting
[18:23] me come to this camp third time this
[18:25] past three years and the first year I
[18:27] went I got baptized and I really got
[18:29] molested by that and it stuck with me
[18:32] all these years and this year was really
[18:35] different and it really changed me
[18:37] the first service that we had I held
[18:41] back and I did not go up for prayer and
[18:43] I really regret that but the second year
[18:46] I mean the second time the second
[18:48] service I went up for piyo and I'm so
[18:52] glad I did that
[18:53] the devil kept on telling me not to but
[18:55] I still did and I really got blessed by
[18:58] that and Saturday night is always the
[19:00] best because they have the power line
[19:02] work and so I was going through the pay
[19:04] line and I felt something lift me up it
[19:06] was amazing and I started screaming and
[19:10] jumping and then I fainted and I saw a
[19:13] light and I don't know how to describe
[19:16] it but it was truly amazing and I woke
[19:19] up and they were dragging me off the
[19:22] stage and I started skiing again and it
[19:27] was truly amazing and I really got
[19:29] blessed this year
[19:32] thank you Aven Esther why they're
[19:39] growing up one thing man they are
[19:41] growing up
[19:54] um first off I would like to thank
[19:57] brother and sister Dell for paying for
[19:59] this camp so that we could go first I
[20:04] was really when I first went to this
[20:07] camp I was expecting something I was
[20:09] like okay this year I know I'm going to
[20:12] get saved I don't I didn't know which
[20:13] one day it was but I just knew
[20:16] so the first few services before
[20:24] Saturday night I yeah I was like jumpy
[20:29] fired up I was praising God and stuff
[20:32] but there was just something holding me
[20:34] back like something was there and the
[20:37] devil was like saying you're not gonna
[20:39] get saved
[20:40] yeah he was just putting me down he was
[20:43] um yeah he was just telling me a bunch
[20:46] of stuff trying to get into my head and
[20:50] for a little bit I listened to him they
[20:52] know then the preacher made a really
[20:54] good point he said if you really didn't
[20:57] have Jesus and why would they bother
[20:59] bother like trying to tell you that she
[21:01] didn't have that so Saturday night
[21:06] was the prayer line so I was like okay I
[21:09] felt like tonight was the night so I
[21:12] went through the fare line and I was
[21:15] just like the devil tried to come to me
[21:17] again I was like you know what I don't
[21:18] care and go away there you go so hey so
[21:21] I just like going like God and I believe
[21:24] I really got saved this year
[21:31] go stop
[21:37] Thanks older fumbling going yeah I'd
[21:42] like to thank brother down the church
[21:43] for letting us go this year and I
[21:46] believe youth camps give kids in general
[21:50] all kids of all ages the opportunity to
[21:52] be in a godly atmosphere surrounded by
[21:54] other message believers and Christians
[21:55] and it's really an opportunity to let
[21:58] God work in your life
[21:59] yeah and but the Danny steamin brother
[22:01] Andrew did an amazing job and showing
[22:03] God in every verse every sermon was a
[22:05] gift and it was different each time and
[22:08] one thing brother Tim says at the camp
[22:11] that stood out to me was to always come
[22:13] expecting and every service come
[22:15] expecting that's right
[22:17] whether you're young whether old or
[22:18] whether at your home your church you're
[22:20] a youth camp always come expecting
[22:22] because if you come expecting God will
[22:24] show up and if you need them to heal you
[22:27] he'll be your healer and if you need him
[22:28] to save you he'll be your Savior no
[22:30] matter the circumstances hey
[22:32] that stood out to me and how can I and
[22:34] how I can apply that to my life
[22:35] and I believe in all our lives thank you
[22:39] [Applause]
[22:46] nice shirt you got on everybody okay so
[22:53] um first off I would also like to thank
[22:56] brother and sister Dale for allowing us
[22:58] to have this experience at this you camp
[23:00] and I want to start off my testimony by
[23:05] saying that before camp I was dealing
[23:09] with a lot I was struggling with a lot
[23:11] having to do with them the message and
[23:15] deciding on whether it was true or not
[23:18] and mainly because because of that that
[23:23] struggle that I was dealing with I had
[23:26] some friends that I used to be in the
[23:29] message and they went out in the world
[23:31] and they were trying to convince me that
[23:33] this message wasn't true and that
[23:37] brother Brendan was a false prophet and
[23:38] they were using a lot of that
[23:40] information from
[23:41] the internet and using that you know to
[23:45] kind of battle against me and what I
[23:50] believed and it was really it was a big
[23:53] struggle for me and I was really trying
[23:55] to decide what to believe and I really
[23:58] wasn't sure so on the way to camp I was
[24:03] just kind of really battling that in my
[24:05] mind and when I got to camp out I was
[24:09] really praying like God please reveal
[24:10] this to me because I just want another
[24:12] the truth I just need to know the truth
[24:14] and um so the first few services were
[24:20] really good they answered a lot of my
[24:21] questions actually named but by the end
[24:25] of the camp all my questions I'd been
[24:29] answered
[24:29] every last one and when I went through
[24:36] the prayer line when I got to the the
[24:42] start of the prayer line I felt like the
[24:45] devil was really battling me and I know
[24:48] he was battling everyone it was it was
[24:50] real struggle for everyone but um when I
[24:54] got there I wanted to turn around and I
[24:55] was like I don't know if I can I don't
[24:57] know if I can do this
[24:58] you know but I just pushed through and I
[25:00] went through the prayer line and lifted
[25:02] my hands up and I I felt a presence
[25:06] there I know the angel of the Lord was
[25:07] there and a lot of my friends and other
[25:10] young people were there they said the
[25:12] same thing that they know that angel of
[25:15] the Lord was right there guiding
[25:16] everyone through the prayer line and I
[25:20] really felt that presence and after I
[25:23] went through the prayer line I walked to
[25:25] the back of the church and I was just
[25:28] kind of meditating on God and I looked
[25:30] up and I actually saw the pillar of fire
[25:33] at the end of the prayer line I saw it
[25:35] up above the prayer line it was like an
[25:37] orb I looked at it and it flew behind me
[25:40] and disappeared and I'm really thankful
[25:43] that God let me experience that and
[25:46] something that I'll never forget and it
[25:48] was like a clarification to me that
[25:50] there's no way anyone can tell me that
[25:53] this message isn't true
[25:54] this is this is the truth and this is
[25:57] what it's going to take us in the
[25:58] rapture and I'm really thankful for it
[26:00] and I want to thank the church and
[26:03] everybody for letting us experience this
[26:07] camp and thank you that's all Fame
[26:22] gettin while attender because the devil
[26:26] done started before you get there
[26:28] yeah you notice they always said that
[26:31] right before the wedding the prayer line
[26:33] the devil said something he's usually
[26:34] the first one standing in the prayer
[26:35] line but we know one that's more
[26:39] powerful graters he is in us and he's in
[26:43] the world thank God for all those
[26:44] brothers like brother Danny and all them
[26:46] their brother Andrew Glover the give of
[26:48] their time and give her their heart for
[26:51] the for the use of this of this message
[26:54] so thank God kids you got us to support
[26:58] poor Lucy whatever you need we're here
[27:01] to support you we we didn't just go from
[27:04] zero age to 58 we went through the same
[27:07] things you went through demons might
[27:09] have different names but it was the same
[27:11] demon the same devil so you have our
[27:15] full support of everything that that we
[27:18] need to do so let's let's turn now into
[27:21] revelation 6 and get started for just a
[27:27] little bit kind of review where we were
[27:29] at this morning and then continue on
[27:30] what we were talking about so revelation
[27:32] 6 we're gonna read 1 through 4 so let's
[27:35] bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank
[27:37] you today Lord you've give us another
[27:39] chance to come and be in your house to
[27:42] worship you in spirit and truth and to
[27:43] hear that you're not dead you're alive
[27:46] you're alive in the youth you're alive
[27:49] in the child you're alive in the older
[27:51] generation all of us Lord you take care
[27:53] of every one of us
[27:55] Lord you are an ever-present help in the
[27:58] time of trouble you said you'd be there
[28:01] when no one else would be father you've
[28:04] given our youth of this church you good
[28:08] workgroup to to be someone they can come
[28:10] to and and speak to so lord I pray that
[28:13] that you would minister to these young
[28:15] children also in the time that we're
[28:17] here and that we would not do anything
[28:20] to hinder their walk with God that we'll
[28:24] all be as brother Dale says when you
[28:27] dedicate the baby in this church you did
[28:29] it this whole church dedicates that baby
[28:30] we all are commissioned to live before
[28:33] it so that it can be raised in the
[28:35] admonition of God forgive us of our sins
[28:38] Lord that we do make against you Lord
[28:40] all the things that are going through
[28:41] our mind of the world and the things of
[28:44] the world and Lord we pray that you just
[28:47] now settle us for just a little while
[28:48] longer Lord this day and you be the
[28:52] speaker Lord you'd be the one that does
[28:54] the revealing you'd be the one that does
[28:56] the manifestation be the revealer of the
[28:59] word Lord people with each one that's
[29:01] here Lord be with ones that are sick all
[29:03] the prayer requests that we've heard and
[29:06] the ones that are in all of our hearts
[29:07] Lord we pray that you would minister to
[29:09] each one probably give us this day our
[29:11] daily bread give them ministry Lord the
[29:13] the missionaries give them fruit for
[29:16] their labor Lord as they labor in the
[29:17] fields Lord to bless them and take care
[29:19] of them we ask these things in the name
[29:22] of Jesus Christ amen
[29:24] revelation 6:1 and I saw when the lamb
[29:27] opened one of the seals and heard it was
[29:29] the noise of thunder one of the four
[29:30] beasts saying come and see
[29:32] I saw him behold a white horse and he
[29:34] that sat on him had a bow and a crown
[29:35] was given unto him he went forth
[29:37] conquering and to conquer we've covered
[29:39] that already now we're on the second
[29:42] seal and when he had opened the second
[29:43] seal I heard the second beast which was
[29:45] what the Ox say come and see and there
[29:49] went out another horse that was read now
[29:51] this is another horse but the same rider
[29:53] and power was given to him that sat
[29:55] thereon to take peace from the earth and
[29:56] that they should kill one another and
[29:58] there was given unto him a great sword
[30:01] and you may be seated in the Lord at his
[30:02] blessing to the reading of the word
[30:04] Lewis when Lewis was talking Wednesday
[30:06] night you know he was talking about a
[30:08] war he was talking about a battle a
[30:13] spiritual battle amen because the
[30:17] kingdom of God is taken by force Satan
[30:20] is going to use all his junk again
[30:21] just why not use a little bit back God
[30:24] give us a two-edged sword and it's the
[30:28] Word of God it's not something that
[30:29] Satan concocted or somebody concocted
[30:31] and it's going to go away no this word
[30:33] that we got is always eternal never will
[30:37] change the poor oh the poor old Mormon
[30:41] Bibles changed five or six hundred times
[30:43] this has been written how in the world
[30:44] are you going to put set your life on
[30:47] something that's change that mean time
[30:49] but it has not changed this Bible Lord
[30:51] has been written since the foundation of
[30:53] the world it was in the mind of God and
[30:58] it was made manifest in words that we
[31:03] can read so if you know what God said
[31:05] just open Bible read what he said that's
[31:08] what he said
[31:09] is it he didn't say nothing else this is
[31:11] exactly what he said
[31:12] so in this seal that we're talking about
[31:15] today for just for a background we now
[31:18] we were talking this morning if you'll
[31:20] bring up the part about Redemption we're
[31:21] going to fly through these first ones
[31:23] and then we'll get into the what we want
[31:24] to talk about but we now change to
[31:26] another to another horse rider wake up
[31:31] back then another horse rider
[31:38] thank you all right they're just having
[31:42] a shuffle around a little bit like that
[31:43] that's okay but we're still coming plan
[31:45] of redemption we're still talking about
[31:47] the plan of redemption for the breaking
[31:52] of the seals is not necessarily for the
[31:54] soul we'll keep reading this because I
[31:55] want you to understand that that the
[31:57] soul is redeemed by the new birth the
[31:59] shed blood of Jesus Christ at Calvary
[32:01] but this will bring full fellowship back
[32:03] in the manifestation you and I what we
[32:06] have you have to have it in your heart
[32:09] to be closer to God it has to be a
[32:12] desire in your heart to know more about
[32:13] the Creator it has to be a desire in
[32:16] your heart to know about the guy that
[32:17] took you from a miry pit like we were
[32:20] talking about the the the glass picked
[32:22] you up now listen if God picks you up
[32:28] remember God doesn't do Gaza to do like
[32:31] us you know we may walk by and go I
[32:33] think I'll pick that up
[32:35] I don't want to use that only you
[32:36] something else God's not that way once
[32:38] he reaches and picks you up or picked
[32:41] that glass up he was going to do
[32:43] something with it
[32:44] him anyone just going to put it on a
[32:46] shelf so same way with you if he's
[32:48] picked you up today he's gonna use you
[32:51] for something hey man I think sometimes
[32:55] we do think well I think you know God
[32:57] God picked me up but I don't know what
[33:00] he's gonna do with it he knows exactly
[33:01] what he's gonna do with you
[33:03] what we have to do though is yield
[33:05] ourselves to that yield ourselves to
[33:08] what God's wanting for us in this end
[33:10] time because he you have to be specific
[33:15] for your day Leuchars new birth it's not
[33:19] the same it's the same new birth but
[33:21] it's not that is if we the just shall
[33:24] live by faith now if we just believe
[33:25] that we could all go down to bustering
[33:28] days and have a beer and eat some hot
[33:30] wings and watch television no really I
[33:32] mean that's but now that's not our day
[33:34] right amen why we have moved up God has
[33:38] moved us to a higher plane to where now
[33:41] we know that has to be done away with
[33:44] no more that no more drinking smoking
[33:47] gambling cutters why I said every one of
[33:50] us in this room today if you're born
[33:53] again under the message of this hour
[33:55] you're a so special group of people and
[33:59] it's what God said no I'm trying I'm not
[34:01] trying to build you up yeah I'm trying
[34:03] to help your faith but I shouldn't have
[34:05] to be you know God doesn't need
[34:09] cheerleaders he's God he can handle it
[34:13] himself
[34:14] hey man because remember he's got to be
[34:18] specific to you they meant you you and
[34:22] God together as persons there in the
[34:25] walk that you have amen
[34:30] but it will bring full fellowship
[34:33] it will bring when since I've been
[34:35] looking at these things a little bit
[34:36] more you know what it does it makes you
[34:39] it's kind of like when we first started
[34:41] him in school and we were we were
[34:43] working on our like Deanna's not here
[34:45] today but she was here this morning
[34:47] 2 plus 2 is 4 2 plus 2 is 4
[34:52] 2 plus 2 is 4 2 plus 2 is 4 then you
[34:55] move then you know yeah that would be
[34:57] kind of it would be real mundane to be
[35:00] in the 8th grade and the teacher go out
[35:03] now today we're gonna learn 2 plus 2 is
[35:05] 4 and you're gonna go man
[35:08] I learned that back but if you had to
[35:11] bet for what you had back there right
[35:12] but see you want more you want the
[35:14] calculus 2 trigonometry I wanted and I
[35:16] wanted to get into some things that it
[35:19] challenged you a little bit and I think
[35:21] that's what God wants to do God wants to
[35:23] take us in the word and challenge us
[35:25] he's already said it he's not going to
[35:30] change
[35:31] we're the ones just gotta change he's
[35:34] not going to change listen there will be
[35:37] a bride that takes a rapture there will
[35:41] be a bride that takes a body change I'm
[35:43] just gonna believe that I am one of them
[35:47] amen
[35:50] because there's no word in the word
[35:52] he'll ever tell you you clean nowhere
[35:57] nowhere in the Bible he's gonna say now
[36:00] you're just not gonna make it now
[36:03] there's a group that won't make it
[36:05] because they decided they wasn't gonna
[36:07] make it
[36:07] amen but there is a group there they
[36:11] decided they was going to make it and
[36:13] they made it because you and I are
[36:15] standing here today with the fullness of
[36:18] the word the fullness of redemption my
[36:22] Martin Luther would have loved to be
[36:24] sitting here today not just to hear me
[36:26] but to but to hear the message of the
[36:29] hour and tape man you know what if I was
[36:33] Martin Luther I'd if I was listening to
[36:35] brother Ram I say I'm glad that prophet
[36:37] mentioned my name I'm glad he mentioned
[36:41] my name a lot cuz I was part of the plan
[36:46] I was part of the plan of God all these
[36:50] men are parts sure their heads of the
[36:52] church are there seven stars but they
[36:56] they would have been nothing without the
[36:57] people they would have been nothing
[37:00] without the congregation most of the
[37:03] people in these ages Columba died
[37:10] Columba died before they started
[37:12] somewhere in there one of them did but
[37:15] what happened somebody picked up his
[37:17] message they picked up Paul's message
[37:20] and because Paul died right here in the
[37:22] first part of the church age 80 50
[37:25] something and he died in whatever was a
[37:27] little bit after that but what happened
[37:29] was somebody hey they didn't even have
[37:30] recorders they had to go by what John
[37:36] was preaching because John was the last
[37:39] one to die he was you know went up into
[37:41] the 1890s then he was the last one they
[37:44] said John what did Paul say John said I
[37:47] tell you what Paul said I tell you what
[37:50] I saw over there in Revelation and you
[37:53] know what those people believed there
[37:55] why cuz they had the whole ego the Holy
[37:57] Ghost will always lead you to the word
[38:00] not sure there's gonna be times he's
[38:02] gonna go more in the world did that come
[38:04] from but you just wait a while that
[38:08] Potter he starts and we got a pottery
[38:11] place right across the road that's one
[38:12] of my first jobs
[38:13] he's starting and he was a master Potter
[38:15] but you know why sometimes he starts
[38:17] that pot and it start wobbling you know
[38:20] what do you do he didn't throw it away
[38:22] he just pushed him back down put a
[38:26] little more water of the word put a
[38:29] little more water on it flipped it over
[38:32] and you know what
[38:35] pretty little strawberry jar about that
[38:37] high put the lip on it and that's the
[38:40] way God did with you but I remember he
[38:43] didn't make a mistake in making you our
[38:47] problem is we get a little wobbly we get
[38:51] a little too much of this and a little
[38:52] too much of that but once everything is
[38:54] perfect it's been putting that kill and
[38:56] you can't change it either once it's
[38:59] made
[39:00] made you can't change it same way with
[39:02] you and I once you're born again you're
[39:04] born again once you've come up this
[39:06] statue of a perfect man listen what
[39:08] would be a father that would give you
[39:10] these things and then take them away
[39:11] from you no no no he wants to enhance
[39:15] what you have he wants to take what he's
[39:18] already taught and say that's my child
[39:22] he's listening he's learning so the
[39:26] breaking of the seals is not necessarily
[39:28] for the soul but what I've just been
[39:29] talking about full fellowship back to
[39:33] where Adam had no problem walking in
[39:35] front of God we should come boldly to
[39:38] the throne now remember what we were
[39:41] talking about with the example of the
[39:44] Holy of Holies you know you got your
[39:48] Holy of Holies and you got you out of
[39:49] court well let's go in here out of court
[39:53] and then you got an inner Court where
[39:54] the candlesticks were then you got the
[39:55] Holy of Holies one man goes in there
[39:58] talks to God there weren't a whole bunch
[39:59] of people in there right now there was a
[40:02] lot of people out here and some of the
[40:06] priests could go in here remember even
[40:07] David went in here Nate some of the
[40:08] shewbread
[40:09] but he didn't eat tasty bread in that
[40:11] holy holy he'd have been a dead fella
[40:13] because why because God said only the
[40:17] high free so the high priest would go in
[40:19] well now what would the high priests do
[40:21] when they're by South but when he got
[40:23] finished he come out when you get born
[40:28] again you don't just get I wished I wish
[40:31] you could get tucked away with garden
[40:33] and nothing else bother you I wish we
[40:36] could go into what they call a Holy of
[40:38] Holies brother brining and everything it
[40:43] will just wait yeah well don't worry in
[40:47] the Millennium even here when we get a
[40:50] body change but in the Millennium it's
[40:51] all gonna be just like the Holy of
[40:53] Holies all the time but right now we had
[40:55] to walk he had to walk back out and go
[40:59] again he had to walk listen the high
[41:02] priests had to go through here to get to
[41:03] the holy Holies the next year he had to
[41:06] go through the same thing hey man
[41:09] same thing with you and I you got to go
[41:11] through I die daily
[41:13] being born again being justified freely
[41:17] going through here now we're in this
[41:19] second court or sanctification and
[41:23] that's what we're talking about today
[41:25] excuse my voice but let's go to the next
[41:28] skip that down to number two just a kind
[41:31] of background this morning we were
[41:34] reading this and I want to read it again
[41:35] now remember this is for sister Jeanne
[41:38] said she wasn't here this morning yeah
[41:42] I'm picking on you now told you I would
[41:45] but remember but remember this is the
[41:48] seal this is the seal that had all this
[41:51] sealed up once our brother Brian said
[41:53] now when we go through breaking these
[41:54] seals you're gonna see it goes phlegm
[41:56] back in the scripture we're going to
[41:57] read something a little while all the
[41:58] way back for each one of those seals the
[42:00] whole thing together the whole mystery
[42:03] lives right here in these seals see
[42:05] every mystery of the Bible lays in these
[42:07] seals and the seals cannot be broken
[42:09] until that time I'm proving here in a
[42:11] minute notice now the book remember is
[42:13] sealed here's one that one fellow here's
[42:18] one another one's wrapped a seal you
[42:21] know this was like a book we already
[42:22] explained this but just a little bit
[42:23] more okay somebody chimed in on the
[42:25] internet this is the way a book looked
[42:27] back then the book didn't look like this
[42:29] this was a scroll it was an unrolling of
[42:32] a piece of paper it's a book of
[42:36] redemption and the whole thing together
[42:37] makes the book and it's sealed with
[42:39] seven seals so it's got a seal on it
[42:41] being it's on the back side it's called
[42:43] just wound up so since wound up the seal
[42:46] mystery is on the inside and it only
[42:53] says the wild horse rider black horse
[42:55] rider what you talking about this what
[42:57] had it sealed this but once that seals
[43:02] broke you can read what God's got inside
[43:05] of it this is the important part
[43:08] amen the Diploma is really not the house
[43:12] to finish school it shows you finish
[43:14] school but they're not gonna give you a
[43:16] diploma if you never step your foot in
[43:19] in a college before so what's important
[43:23] that grade 1 to 12 all the time you put
[43:26] and all the effort and all the tests you
[43:28] took hello all attached you took then
[43:31] you get a diploma which says you
[43:34] finished the course and please it don't
[43:38] let it be a death certificate hey man
[43:42] don't let it be a death certificate only
[43:48] the one that says you went from death
[43:49] unto life
[43:49] a man from Genesis to Revelation a
[43:53] complete plan of redemption is revealed
[43:55] in these seven seals so that's what
[43:57] we're talking about we're talking with a
[43:58] revelation of complete redemption in
[44:01] these seals god help us to get it all
[44:04] right let's go remember the seals I told
[44:06] you this morning the seals done this it
[44:08] shows the redemption of the Jews to
[44:11] Gentiles the world and the defeat of
[44:13] Satan
[44:14] so I like this it's the defeat of Satan
[44:19] this he's done and he's finished and
[44:21] then y'all ought to be happy about that
[44:23] this guy he torments me I don't know
[44:26] about y'all must go home different
[44:27] nothing
[44:28] hey torments me always run kids I'm
[44:33] telling you that's his job and he's good
[44:37] at his job but we got a god this better
[44:40] at his job
[44:42] we got a god that's now in human flesh
[44:46] rat around you able to help you show you
[44:51] the way
[44:55] the truth in the life
[44:57] you show that's Jesus I know that the
[45:03] words yeah he's still hanging on the
[45:07] cross he still got that Roman seal I was
[45:10] so much this morning I like that cuz
[45:15] when that Roman went right here before
[45:17] this first Church has happened Rome put
[45:19] a seal brother Larry on a tomb a Roman
[45:24] seal they sealed it with wax in the
[45:27] Roman seal and when God broke the seal
[45:32] Rome still said now they just come in
[45:35] and stole his body
[45:36] so the first lay that Roman Rome
[45:39] right there to me is the first life they
[45:44] never meant anything
[45:45] they lied about that and got a whole
[45:47] group of people to lie with them
[45:50] Oh Satan is a liar but when Peter stood
[45:54] on the day of Pentecost oh praise the
[45:56] Lord when Peter stone their pen coughs
[45:58] he said I don't have to see that to me
[46:01] yeah I know it's empty cause it didn't
[46:05] me
[46:07] he poured itself inside of us starting
[46:13] on the day of Pentecost till the day you
[46:15] got born again he broke that self Satan
[46:18] had on you and then he put his eternal
[46:22] seal what kind of Roman seal could keep
[46:25] God in a tomb I don't think Jesus had to
[46:29] do this let me get that stone off
[46:32] hopefully no you know what the Angels
[46:35] angel just said move let my let my guard
[46:38] out move and that thing just wept no
[46:44] effort nobody grunted on the day of the
[46:47] resurrection it was just and Jesus
[46:52] probably looks at the angel said thank
[46:53] you I may need you later and then walk
[46:56] thrown out hey man
[46:58] so that was God in human flesh he had a
[47:01] glorified body amen you think I'm crazy
[47:06] remember what happened at the when Jesus
[47:09] went into the wilderness you remember
[47:12] what the Bible said when he came out of
[47:13] the wilderness he said angels angels
[47:16] comforted him ministered to him
[47:20] amen so let's don't go so far while just
[47:22] when I said that your eyes get crossed
[47:25] don't you think God had a Jesus that
[47:28] angels all around him you know what and
[47:30] they knew who he was this dumb humans
[47:36] didn't like Tony's the devil and angels
[47:40] are over in another dimension going that
[47:42] what where's Bob Bob's in the back what
[47:45] this guy's nothing but God himself the
[47:51] Bible even tells you that the devil
[47:53] believes and
[47:53] Oh God and trembles but he started
[47:56] riding in this age going come on change
[47:58] that I'm gonna make him bleed free when
[48:02] I can only see one myself what it's
[48:05] Sivir
[48:07] all right review we reviewed the wild
[48:09] horse the Roman seal all right let's
[48:11] keep going cuz I'm only going down
[48:12] through here we talked about Daniel
[48:15] you can't possibly hit all the things
[48:17] because it could take just one of those
[48:18] seals and stay just bring it right
[48:19] through the scripture right now see it
[48:21] takes months and months it's just had us
[48:23] to we had we had ten services on first
[48:25] seal now we won't have them in any on
[48:27] second because I told you had to have a
[48:28] foundation but and that first Hill is
[48:31] very important what it does it turns
[48:32] your mind and tastes like I said before
[48:34] it takes that womb of your mind and it
[48:36] it totally changes the way you're
[48:39] thinking because the wait listen people
[48:41] the way everybody thinks listen and part
[48:43] of it most of the people in the message
[48:44] that that seal was the revelation of the
[48:47] wild horse rider and that's it that's it
[48:52] we should have a rapture and nothing
[48:54] said keep late hey man there's something
[48:58] that we've got to have that's never been
[49:02] known before you show all that makes you
[49:05] special yeah I didn't say that he did
[49:08] the property God stood on the sixth seal
[49:10] he said you're not getting it he said
[49:14] it's not even for you
[49:19] and I don't think any of us were there
[49:23] but he said somebody's gonna get it
[49:28] because he's talking about that little
[49:30] crystal that little diamond that when he
[49:31] changed the when he changed the radio
[49:34] station it would hit that crystal and
[49:37] once it hit that crystal sea it'd be a
[49:39] sound that we would hear that nobody
[49:41] else would hear it's a sound that nobody
[49:43] else would hear listen this is foreign
[49:46] even the most people in the message this
[49:48] is so foreign how do you mean the white
[49:51] horse riders the Antichrist in US and
[49:53] that's all that and that's not all there
[49:55] is to it it's not that just opened it up
[49:58] so you can see the rest of it that just
[50:00] opened up the revelation of one God cuz
[50:02] that's what they had the first church
[50:04] age
[50:10] see it took months and months and months
[50:12] you still wouldn't have it cuz the seal
[50:13] itself times the entire scripture from
[50:15] Genesis to Revelation one sale all right
[50:18] let's go to the next one real quick the
[50:22] sixth seal now the earthquake let's
[50:24] compare scriptures now I won't have you
[50:25] got pence on paper with you I want to do
[50:27] something for you for writing down okay
[50:28] anyway I want you to read with me as you
[50:30] do compare scripture of this great event
[50:32] I want you to understand something what
[50:35] happened the winds did not and what
[50:37] happened on Thursday morning I believe
[50:39] was of God what brother Lewis preached
[50:43] on Wednesday night Thursday morning a
[50:46] 5.3 earthquake hit California off the
[50:48] coast not inside off the coast and she's
[50:51] supposed to slide off into the ocean the
[50:57] great earthquake will happen I promise
[50:59] you when we come to a place cuz we're
[51:05] not gonna be here very long after that
[51:09] amen
[51:10] one way the other anyway you want to
[51:12] look at it you know there's doctrines if
[51:14] it's gonna be the resurrect it doesn't
[51:16] matter it doesn't matter you think we're

[51:21] no listen we can come right if we if
[51:27] we're elect to get have a body change
[51:29] and come to a place an atomic bomb under
[51:33] my chair and don't stop it Oh Tomic
[51:39] bombs everybody goes haywire you say
[51:41] atomic out in the world what's the first
[51:43] thing they do oh Lord I hope they don't
[51:44] drop a bomb on you know what I'm
[51:47] satisfied that the Prophet told us there
[51:50] won't one bomb hit this earth till we're
[51:53] gone so I ain't gonna worry about it
[51:55] dirty bomb whatever bomb any atomic bomb
[51:58] I'm telling you brother branham give us
[51:59] many many keys that should be settled we
[52:02] should not be nervous about this thing
[52:04] don't worry about China North Korea what
[52:06] America's gonna do don't worry about
[52:07] that
[52:08] worry about what's happening in your
[52:11] country
[52:13] because this is what country you can
[52:16] change you can't change that country out
[52:17] there I want you to read with me as you
[52:21] do compare Scripture this great event
[52:23] that we will see that this great secret
[52:25] of mystery that was under the sixth seal
[52:27] of the book of redemption now remember
[52:29] these are hidden mysteries in the sixth
[52:31] seal all together is one great big book
[52:33] you say he keeps saying sixth seal it's
[52:35] got to be seven hold on a minute just
[52:37] say Scrolls rolled together and
[52:39] otherwise the whole book of redemption
[52:40] that's how the Old Earth whole earth was
[52:42] redeemed because remember the seventh
[52:44] seal has no it has no scene there
[52:49] silence in heaven for this place might
[52:50] have an hour there's nothing written and
[52:54] why did Jesus come up in Matthew 24 and
[52:57] just preach sick sail you know what he
[53:00] was doing he was preaching and then at
[53:03] the end he went to Israel but at the end
[53:05] he stopped just for a minute but they
[53:09] wasn't nobody there to get it there
[53:12] wasn't nobody there to get it but he
[53:15] said I've expect to you are the thunder
[53:21] that you're missing I am he that will
[53:25] redeem your body now you say where's
[53:29] that in the Bible I think I read it in
[53:31] that little love letter part that God
[53:32] told us to read because Jesus told to me
[53:35] see watch this watch this was this was
[53:37] this nice top he preached 73 16 because
[53:41] sick sales finishes Redemption just like
[53:43] we said this morning
[53:44] the six fold purpose puts Israel in the
[53:47] Millennium the six seals puts us in the
[53:49] Millennium that's just as easy as you
[53:51] can make it right there amen Daniel 9:24
[53:55] say if seventy weeks are determined upon
[53:57] thy people and the holy city so there's
[53:59] two things we're looking at here to
[54:01] finish the transgression make an end of
[54:02] sins make a reconciliation for iniquity
[54:04] bringing everlasting righteousness seal
[54:06] up the vision and prophecy don't know
[54:07] what the most holy that's six things
[54:09] alright then what happens when brother
[54:13] brown said the north the most holy is
[54:15] when we come back in the Millenium cuz
[54:17] we're the most holy a man only prophet
[54:20] could tell us that a man so who's who is
[54:24] with us
[54:26] I'm sorry who do we come with who do we
[54:29] come with right at the end of the six
[54:32] seals Christ comes on the scene at the
[54:37] end of the six fold purpose Christ comes
[54:40] on the scene takes us all in the
[54:42] Millennium then all right say man now
[54:46] what is this break it again pull it up
[54:50] the next one excuse me
[54:53] six fold purpose to finish the
[54:56] transgression to finish what to finish
[54:58] Israel's transgression what is the
[55:00] transgression
[55:01] it's to go against something that we're
[55:03] back on the first seal so this is all
[55:05] this country stuff a transgress against
[55:09] me is to do it wrong to me
[55:11] remember they transgressed against God
[55:13] they told economy's bill Zebub all right
[55:17] transgress against uses their own to you
[55:19] so Israel did it wrong to God and in
[55:22] this 70th week what's going to happen
[55:25] God is going to finish the transgression
[55:27] of Israel God is going to finish our
[55:31] transgression Hey look when God finishes
[55:35] something it's done amen
[55:38] that's why I was telling you when god
[55:40] finishes something he doesn't say oh
[55:42] well let me back up I gotta know he knew
[55:44] God never backs up God never makes a he
[55:47] never has a moment never sinned hoops
[55:49] Amen told Esther was in the eternal
[55:52] thought and it's expressed so he cannot
[55:55] make a mistake finish the transgression
[55:58] will be turning away the ungodliness
[56:00] from Jacob and then all Israel will be
[56:02] born again
[56:03] all of them will receive the Holy Ghost
[56:05] that's through the two prophets right
[56:07] now the next one is to make an end of
[56:10] sins and we'll get to that next Sunday
[56:12] so now let's go to the seal that's where
[56:14] we were at this morning right here when
[56:16] he had opened the second seal I heard
[56:18] the second beast say come and see
[56:20] and they went out another horse it was
[56:22] red now we got to deal with red we've
[56:24] dealt with white we've dealt with a
[56:26] white righteous church that was on the
[56:28] earth and we dealt with a white imposter
[56:31] amen
[56:32] contrast and power was given to him that
[56:36] sat there own to take peace from the
[56:38] earth and they should kill one
[56:40] another pretty bloody scene and there
[56:42] was given unto him a great sword all
[56:45] right
[56:45] he'd have their story it was a bluff
[56:47] back here and then we read through the
[56:49] church and we read through the Book of
[56:51] Revelations we're not gonna read it
[56:52] again but now we come to this excuse me
[56:56] this fourth church age now this fourth
[56:59] Church age started in 606 and lasted to
[57:05] 1520 during that time the Crusades were
[57:08] from 1095 to 1291 the Pope called for
[57:13] the liberation of Christians during that
[57:15] time now what we were talking about
[57:17] remember we read and I got this we're
[57:20] brother Branham I'll read it right here
[57:23] it's not up here something I'm gonna
[57:24] read it I'll read it next Sunday do you
[57:26] know what five Tyrel means dominating
[57:29] female that's why that that scripture
[57:33] says you have to Jezebel's doctrine and
[57:36] you've made it the truth and they put a
[57:40] pope the head over it and we'll read it
[57:45] this next Sunday but he says look it was
[57:49] also in this church age that the false
[57:51] church defied the first commandment and
[57:55] broke the second commandment remember
[57:59] the commandments of the seals we put
[58:01] them right here what was the second
[58:03] commandment you'll have no other I don't
[58:06] pull up an idol and all that stuff right
[58:08] that's what brother Brown said I'll read
[58:10] it right here next Sunday well I got
[58:11] ahead of myself I thought that was
[58:12] really good for us to keep like I said
[58:15] this thing just keeps on folding and
[58:17] folding and unfolding but we got to get
[58:20] the gist of this whole thing so go to
[58:23] the next one Matthew 24 Jesus said and
[58:29] you shall hear of wars and rumors of
[58:30] wars see remember what Lois was
[58:33] preaching of I was rejoicing Wednesday
[58:35] night here he comes up and God said
[58:38] Jesus said you gotta take this kingdom
[58:40] by force a war you shall hear of wars
[58:46] and rumors of wars see that you be not
[58:48] in trouble for all these things must
[58:51] come to pass but the end is not yet
[58:54] so now we've come up to a red horse
[58:56] power was given to take piece and kill
[58:59] and he was given the great sword and we
[59:02] know that that parallels the fourth
[59:03] Church age just like we read this
[59:04] morning revelations 2 and 20 talking
[59:08] about
[59:09] he went from a deed to a doctrine and
[59:13] now in this church age just like we
[59:16] showed you that there was a seven
[59:18] churches in the Old Testament the Dark
[59:21] Age the middle church age in the Old
[59:23] Testament was when what Jezebel and Ahab
[59:26] married church and state married
[59:28] together right amen
[59:30] so that's why he said he says you in
[59:32] other words you're letting this doctrine
[59:34] of this dominating female take over this
[59:39] woman Jezebel your your what does it say
[59:41] let's read it it says what are you doing
[59:44] in other words it said you're letting
[59:47] her in your church a woman's not
[59:50] supposed to hurt some authority over a
[59:52] man a man that all right I mean staying
[59:57] you but yeah that's what it says they're
[1:00:02] lettin Jezebel or Sabbath or T over what
[1:00:05] Christ they changing doctrines verse 18
[1:00:10] to 18 and to the angel of the church in
[1:00:12] Thyatira these things say it's the Son
[1:00:15] of God so it's coming straight from
[1:00:17] Almighty who liked his eyes under light
[1:00:20] a flame of fire and his feet like fine
[1:00:21] brass I know thy works and charity and
[1:00:24] service and faith and patience and works
[1:00:25] last to be more than the first
[1:00:27] notwithstanding I have a few things
[1:00:29] against thee because thou sufferest
[1:00:31] there it is
[1:00:32] thou sufferest that woman Jezebel you're
[1:00:37] letting her in the church you're letting
[1:00:39] the false woman take over listen though
[1:00:42] we are the bride of Jesus Christ but we
[1:00:44] are the greatest thing since God walked
[1:00:47] on the face of the earth we're not
[1:00:49] number one God is the head Jesus Christ
[1:00:54] is our husband now what he says about me
[1:00:58] he's gotta back up amen
[1:01:01] what he said if he says that I am the
[1:01:04] same as him but I won't let him say that
[1:01:07] me I'll get in trouble cuz that's what
[1:01:11] the problem is satan is over here going
[1:01:13] i think i won't be like that
[1:01:15] i think i'll try to i think i'll try to
[1:01:18] entice them in with all with a beautiful
[1:01:21] woman remember john admired that
[1:01:24] thinning a man
[1:01:26] john admired it it was beautiful but
[1:01:30] that angel said hey John that's not
[1:01:33] where you want to go right but they
[1:01:36] suffered that woman Jezebel in other
[1:01:38] words a letter in the church which calls
[1:01:40] herself a prophetess to teach and seduce
[1:01:42] my servants to commit fornication of the
[1:01:46] ething sacrifice an idol I give her
[1:01:48] space to repent and she repented not
[1:01:51] behold I will cast her into a bed and
[1:01:53] then that commit adultery with her her
[1:01:57] daughter's denominational ideas they
[1:02:04] meant remember that that's what the
[1:02:06] Prophet told us that the had
[1:02:09] daughters in the daughters was the
[1:02:10] denominational churches because they are
[1:02:14] going to go through the Great
[1:02:15] Tribulation and I'm not saying they're
[1:02:18] not going to get to go to heaven but
[1:02:20] they go have to stand and give an
[1:02:24] account for their works so he's going to
[1:02:29] throw in the great - why would you say
[1:02:31] well they don't throw the great
[1:02:32] tribulation see that they're out of here
[1:02:33] now they could be given eternal life
[1:02:38] except they repent of their deeds I just
[1:02:40] don't want to stand before any judgment
[1:02:42] with my works I don't care how pure I am
[1:02:45] I don't care how righteous God said I
[1:02:47] was but when God tells me I'm righteous
[1:02:49] that moves me over into another place if
[1:02:53] I move myself over here guess what I'm
[1:02:54] gonna carry with me my works but when I
[1:02:58] move over when God says you come over
[1:03:00] here because your works are gone you're
[1:03:03] gonna be judged by my words I'm gonna
[1:03:05] say okay Lord that's just like the wife
[1:03:07] being submissive to the husband okay
[1:03:09] whatever you say Lord and I will kill
[1:03:13] her children with death what not natural
[1:03:15] death spiritual death and all the
[1:03:17] churches shall know that I am he which
[1:03:19] searches the reins in the heart and I
[1:03:21] give unto every one of you according to
[1:03:23] your works there it is again but until
[1:03:25] you I say into the rest of thought IRA
[1:03:28] now remember it's dominating female as
[1:03:30] many as have not this doctrine in which
[1:03:32] have not known the depths of Satan as
[1:03:34] they speak I will put upon you none of
[1:03:36] the burden just to be a Christian during
[1:03:40] that time you were completely utterly
[1:03:42] destroyed dead naturally dying
[1:03:45] amen but that which you have already
[1:03:48] hold fast till I come here overcometh
[1:03:52] and keepeth my worst of the end him will
[1:03:54] I give power over the nations and he
[1:03:57] shall rule them with a rod of iron as
[1:03:58] the vessels of Potter shall be broken to
[1:04:00] shivers even as I received in my father
[1:04:03] and I will give him the morning star
[1:04:06] amen
[1:04:07] so they're not going to be lost they're
[1:04:09] a great powerful church sitting in a
[1:04:12] dimension waiting on me and you amen
[1:04:17] wait no man you ever they're all waiting
[1:04:19] no men you to do what not to say
[1:04:24] well gods give us a lot more than you
[1:04:26] guys so y'all can stay in there for a
[1:04:27] while no we're our pulls should be
[1:04:29] getting them out of there
[1:04:31] the pull should be I don't want any more
[1:04:33] death to happen I don't want to go to a
[1:04:35] funeral no more amen so let's look at
[1:04:39] sanctification under this seal real
[1:04:43] quick just for a second
[1:04:44] because remember the first one would be
[1:04:47] justification the second because what
[1:04:52] I'll let listen I'll let the Prophet I
[1:04:56] came to spill sanctification
[1:04:58] I'll let the Prophet tell you no don't
[1:05:01] let him tell you this so let's go to
[1:05:02] numbers 19 verse 1 mm-hmm
[1:05:05] pick this up because I thought this was
[1:05:07] great because look Satan was there when
[1:05:11] that was written when the Bible was
[1:05:13] written Satan was standing right there
[1:05:14] okay he said they're gonna have to have
[1:05:18] a red heifer why is it red well if
[1:05:22] they're gonna have a red heifer I'm just
[1:05:24] gonna get me a rental
[1:05:27] hey sometimes it scares me that I think
[1:05:29] the same way the devil does but me
[1:05:39] wasn't wise read why is he going a white
[1:05:41] one and then a red one and then a why
[1:05:43] didn't you stay on one he's deceiving
[1:05:46] yes God moves so does Satan so God said
[1:05:51] I'm gonna give him a red heifer then
[1:05:55] I'll show you in a minute we're brother
[1:05:56] Branham talks about Redemption so Satan
[1:06:00] is going to give them a red horse think
[1:06:01] it there okay I mean what would you
[1:06:03] think
[1:06:04] listen let's put our self right here
[1:06:06] coming out of all this and then what
[1:06:08] happens with Constantine and all that
[1:06:10] church estate comes together and then
[1:06:12] they got this one guy that I'll read you
[1:06:15] next Sunday I think I still got it we're
[1:06:17] even in the history that when they made
[1:06:20] the Pope and fallible well man when you
[1:06:23] make the Pope infallible but now there's
[1:06:26] a nominal I want to say this derogatory
[1:06:29] but a peasant that's poor in the street
[1:06:33] and when they put church and state
[1:06:36] together they start elevating huh they
[1:06:40] start elevating the economy making
[1:06:43] things look better giving them programs
[1:06:46] letting them eat better I I saw a movie
[1:06:50] one time where they were and it was a
[1:06:52] documentary about Al Capone you know Al
[1:06:54] Capone was a murderer a thief a liar or
[1:06:57] a monk I mean listen but during the
[1:07:00] Depression the way he made his money is
[1:07:03] he got all of the bums in New York
[1:07:07] brought him into a place and fed him
[1:07:09] everyone fed him every day he got that
[1:07:12] group of people to like him so much
[1:07:14] until they started talking and they said
[1:07:17] oh I'll Capone's the greatest thing
[1:07:19] everyone's he feeds us he's put clothes
[1:07:21] on us and then it kind of goes out
[1:07:22] that's Matt was what made him
[1:07:24] untouchable that's what made him
[1:07:26] untouchable for all them years they got
[1:07:28] him on all kind of charges but he
[1:07:29] brought the poor people in that's what
[1:07:31] the Pope did the Pope Constantino that
[1:07:33] they brought them poor people in and
[1:07:35] they give them something to eat they put
[1:07:37] him in a church program
[1:07:41] sneaky I'm not against Church programs
[1:07:44] I'm just telling you how Satan works
[1:07:47] he's shrewd like Louie said go back to
[1:07:52] that the kingdom of God is taken by
[1:07:53] force not by flattery I thought flattery
[1:07:57] was the devil
[1:07:58] you never here nowhere in the Bible
[1:08:00] where God said I'm gonna work a little
[1:08:01] flattery here no he said Satan works
[1:08:04] flattery amen this is the ordinance of
[1:08:08] the law which the LORD hath commanded
[1:08:09] saying speaking to the children of
[1:08:11] Israel that they bring the red heifer
[1:08:14] without spot wherein there's no blemish
[1:08:19] and probably brother Brian can tell you
[1:08:21] more about that but he's only can be so
[1:08:23] many haters right so many hairs that can
[1:08:26] be a different color and from what I
[1:08:29] hear is going on now they're trying to
[1:08:31] genetically modify that red heifer here
[1:08:33] in the United States to make it where
[1:08:36] there's no no hairs their white swearing
[1:08:40] there's no blemish go see that's what
[1:08:41] Israel Israel it doesn't listen Israel
[1:08:43] that doesn't think Jesus is here come
[1:08:47] and go back again they're trying to
[1:08:50] bring the Messiah they're trying they're
[1:08:53] not they're not like brother Ram said
[1:08:55] they're serious but they could be
[1:08:57] seriously wrong amen
[1:09:00] but they're trying they got to get that
[1:09:02] red heifer because why
[1:09:03] watch what happens a red heifer without
[1:09:05] spot wearing there's no blemish and upon
[1:09:08] which never came a yoke I'll tell you
[1:09:10] what the Prophet said about all this in
[1:09:11] a minute and he's so given her give her
[1:09:14] until he Eleazar the priest that he may
[1:09:18] bring her forth without the camp and one
[1:09:21] shall slay her before his face and the
[1:09:23] eyes are the priest shall take her blood
[1:09:25] red with his finger and sprinkle of her
[1:09:29] blood directly before the tabernacle of
[1:09:32] the congregation seven times and one
[1:09:35] shall burn the heifer in her sight and
[1:09:37] her skin or flesh her blood with her
[1:09:39] don't shell he burned and the priests
[1:09:41] know the priest shall take cedar wood
[1:09:44] hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the
[1:09:47] midst of the burning of the effort then
[1:09:49] the priest shall wash his clothes and he
[1:09:52] shall bathe his flesh in water
[1:09:54] and afterwards he shall come into the
[1:09:56] camp and the priest shall be unclean
[1:09:59] until the evening time because in the
[1:10:06] evening time he's considered CLE that's
[1:10:10] what I'm reading and he that burn is
[1:10:12] Herschel watch this closing water bathe
[1:10:15] his flesh and water and shall be unclean
[1:10:17] until and a man that is clean shall
[1:10:23] gather up the ashes of the heifer and
[1:10:25] lay them without the camp in a clean
[1:10:27] place and it shall be kept for the
[1:10:30] congregation of the children of Israel
[1:10:32] for a water of separation it is a
[1:10:35] purification for sin they can't go in
[1:10:41] because that purification began first
[1:10:44] they had to have that water of
[1:10:46] separation as a perfect purification for
[1:10:50] sin and what is sanctification cleaned
[1:11:00] clean and set aside outside the camp for
[1:11:05] service that all right say ma'am
[1:11:07] okay everybody got that judgment by
[1:11:12] Redemption 1954 this is what the prophet
[1:11:15] of God said about it now the nineteenth
[1:11:18] chapter I believe book of Exodus the
[1:11:19] Lord God makes the Lord God spoken to
[1:11:21] Moses and Aaron saying this is an
[1:11:23] ordinance of law which the LORD hath
[1:11:24] commanded thee speaking of the children
[1:11:26] of Israel that they bring me a red
[1:11:27] heifer without spot wherein no blemish
[1:11:29] and upon which never came a yoke you
[1:11:31] shall give her till he aids are the
[1:11:33] priests and he may bring her forth
[1:11:35] without the camp and once she lay her
[1:11:37] before his face and Eleazar the police
[1:11:39] priests shall take her blood with his
[1:11:42] finger and sprinkle of the blood
[1:11:43] directly before the tabernacle of the
[1:11:45] congregation seven times now watch
[1:11:48] because remember we're talking about a
[1:11:50] red horse so Satan had to have something
[1:11:52] to copy and then remember the law of
[1:11:55] contrast if Satan had something that was
[1:11:57] white I mean if God had something that
[1:11:59] was white a white righteous church was
[1:12:01] on the earth when the white horse rider
[1:12:03] rode out then it had to be a red there
[1:12:06] had to be something signify
[1:12:08] that read for him to use that
[1:12:10] red-colored of rides because remember
[1:12:12] he's not an originator he's a copycat
[1:12:16] all right he's a copycat what about that
[1:12:20] you know even us as human beings have
[1:12:22] original thoughts we have original
[1:12:25] thought Satan never had an original
[1:12:27] thought
[1:12:30] he's a copycat he waits for God to do
[1:12:34] something there's a name for that oh if
[1:12:40] you know this redheffer know this is
[1:12:41] what the Prophet says about it being the
[1:12:43] female type in the church because
[1:12:47] remember all your other offerings had to
[1:12:50] be around had to be a male of the first
[1:12:54] year had to be this had to be a male
[1:12:56] there's only one other offering tell me
[1:12:59] what it is there's only one other
[1:13:01] offering that you can offer a she-goat
[1:13:07] there is an ignorance offering that
[1:13:11] Abraham he told Abraham there is a
[1:13:14] she-goat to offer for an offering of
[1:13:17] ignorance and I say I love that because
[1:13:18] you know what
[1:13:19] I'll kill him she goes all the time okay
[1:13:25] why God that wasn't funny but it was I
[1:13:27] mean I do it was for an ignorance
[1:13:30] offering if somebody done something out
[1:13:32] of the ignorance they offered her she go
[1:13:33] but now here you've got a female a red
[1:13:36] heifer a heifer - what a cow right
[1:13:41] notice being the female topping the
[1:13:43] church red the color couldn't be spotted
[1:13:47] now it had to be solid so this red horse
[1:13:50] couldn't be spotted that Satan's riding
[1:13:52] on it had to be red all right
[1:13:55] now had to be a solid color and red
[1:13:57] always gives us signifies what if we
[1:14:02] ever heard that word before redemption
[1:14:05] you say red always signifies danger it
[1:14:09] does to us in the red light but it's
[1:14:12] always Redemption - don't run it so red
[1:14:17] has always been the signal through the
[1:14:18] Bible the harlot Rahab let the spider
[1:14:22] to a start scarlet cloth or scarlet
[1:14:24] court which was a sign of God left her
[1:14:27] house standing now notice here this red
[1:14:31] heifer was to be brought Hilde in the
[1:14:32] presence of Eleazar he was to take her
[1:14:35] hoofs and all burner before she while
[1:14:37] she was dying he took him dipped his
[1:14:39] finger in her blood and sprinkled it to
[1:14:41] the tabernacle and dipped his fingers in
[1:14:43] the blood and sprinkled it toward the
[1:14:44] tabernacle and did this seven times
[1:14:46] signifying the seven dispensation or
[1:14:49] seven Church ages amen
[1:14:52] towards redemption to all 7 Church ages
[1:14:55] are the seven churches that the church
[1:14:58] would be sprinkled by the blood that the
[1:15:02] judgment was placed upon the heifer
[1:15:04] seven times the blood was sprinkled the
[1:15:08] blood sacrifice making an atonement
[1:15:11] standing instead of judgment seven times
[1:15:15] then the heifer was put in the fire was
[1:15:17] burned up ashes than anything that
[1:15:20] Israel it made a what they call the
[1:15:22] waters of separation now watch this
[1:15:25] right here now you talk about fit right
[1:15:27] into what we're talking about and there
[1:15:29] was burned scarlet scarlet hyssop and
[1:15:31] was put together and burnt which meant
[1:15:32] the dispensation of what grace
[1:15:35] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:15:38] the Holy Ghost through cedar hyssop and
[1:15:40] scarlet and was all burnt together hey
[1:15:43] man that's a good quote I like that one
[1:15:44] look at number four fellowship 1955
[1:15:50] positionally place yourself now for
[1:15:52] tonight get under the blood all these
[1:15:55] things that's in your heart get them out
[1:15:56] go before God under the blood confession
[1:15:59] your wrongs and call and make it right
[1:16:00] help me Moses got an answer to prayer
[1:16:03] right away because he went to God what
[1:16:05] God's Way under the blood for he could
[1:16:08] have fellowship he went in under the
[1:16:10] blood now notice the lamb was slain back
[1:16:12] in the Old Testament they had a red
[1:16:14] heifer told Moses when they started this
[1:16:16] journey saying they'll make a provision
[1:16:19] listen God knew that that sacrifice
[1:16:23] those sacrifices could not make those
[1:16:26] people clean we read it last night
[1:16:29] there's no way if it'll made them clean
[1:16:32] I read you the quote last night if
[1:16:33] Caiaphas
[1:16:36] killing a lamb and sprinkling the blood
[1:16:38] you know the once a year atonement if
[1:16:40] that was all I needed
[1:16:42] then eternity with it said you the
[1:16:45] eternal life would be right there and it
[1:16:48] wouldn't have no use to going anywhere
[1:16:49] else but the Bible says every year he
[1:16:51] had to go in to do the same thing every
[1:16:53] year but Christ never had to get on a
[1:16:56] cross again that's done and finished now
[1:17:00] make a provision for the cleansiness
[1:17:04] look that word up cleansiness
[1:17:07] of the people as they journey on how you
[1:17:10] and I what daily sanctification you and
[1:17:15] I daily sanctification
[1:17:19] you shall brother I was clean and set
[1:17:21] aside for service yeah but you had to
[1:17:23] move from that first one if you stayed
[1:17:25] under that clean and set aside for
[1:17:27] service Satan could fill that thing back
[1:17:29] up I'd proved it to you this morning
[1:17:32] when the unclean spirit goes out of a
[1:17:34] man amen
[1:17:38] 10:4 is important but now let's go to
[1:17:42] the one we're talking about under the
[1:17:43] seals now same thing though you're
[1:17:45] already sealed in but God still calls
[1:17:48] for a daily sanctification through what
[1:17:52] that statue of a perfect man because you
[1:17:56] don't get all them virtues when you
[1:17:57] first get the new birth you get faith
[1:17:59] you have a potential to get them all
[1:18:02] amen but we need virtue we need
[1:18:06] knowledge or we were you know what Peter
[1:18:08] would have said Peter said hey you got
[1:18:10] it all when you believed he didn't say
[1:18:13] that he said those that haven't received
[1:18:15] the divine nature of God they bow in
[1:18:19] person divine hey man hey but one person
[1:18:23] divine that's Almighty God he said
[1:18:25] receiving the divine nature of God go on
[1:18:27] and add these things up listen how in
[1:18:31] the world you gonna get God's character
[1:18:32] and you don't have gardenia paint my
[1:18:36] brother Graham said some people have
[1:18:38] these things and they're just natural
[1:18:39] people I know somebody just like brother
[1:18:42] Richard Wilson was telling us he said
[1:18:43] that was a man in his work that if you
[1:18:45] walk to him Clement said look I'm gonna
[1:18:46] take your paycheck away from you for the
[1:18:48] next four weeks he said okay that's
[1:18:51] you wouldn't do that to me I'd show you
[1:18:54] my temperance but this guy was a safe
[1:19:00] person he was just a nominal gun what
[1:19:02] name a nominal Christian he was just a
[1:19:04] God he was just so making mouth so see
[1:19:06] the meek shall inherit the earth but
[1:19:08] listen the meat with the new birth shall
[1:19:10] inherit the earth
[1:19:11] hey man not just the meek you can be
[1:19:13] meek and humble and be the devil I'm
[1:19:17] gonna charge you fella now make a
[1:19:19] provision for the cleanliness of people
[1:19:21] as they journey on for if they do do
[1:19:23] wrong they're out of fellowship read it
[1:19:27] and before they can fellowship I want
[1:19:30] you to make a waters of separation for
[1:19:33] them and when Moses was commanded to
[1:19:36] take a then Moses command to take a red
[1:19:39] heifer a young heifer now I want you to
[1:19:41] notice the word red means something to
[1:19:44] you and I read means danger but read in
[1:19:47] the Bible means redemption redemption
[1:19:51] through the blood all the way from
[1:19:54] Genesis to revelations there's a red
[1:19:56] streak of blood all the way through red
[1:20:00] all the way notice they had to come
[1:20:03] under the shed blood amen that all right
[1:20:07] so now we're talking about
[1:20:09] sanctification we'll get into that more
[1:20:11] next Sunday but let's go to the next one
[1:20:13] here now let's read Matthew 12:43 now
[1:20:20] when the unclean spirit is gone out of a
[1:20:23] man I want somebody in the name of the
[1:20:26] Lord to tell me where that unclean
[1:20:28] spirit was before it left you it was you
[1:20:35] it was your own nature when the unclean
[1:20:39] spirit is gone out of a man he walketh
[1:20:44] through Dry places why because he's a
[1:20:46] demon oh yeah he was a demon and still
[1:20:52] he is he walketh through Dry places
[1:20:55] seeking rest finders none how you
[1:20:56] noticed a demon what's this then he said
[1:20:59] I will return into my
[1:21:01] from whence I came out Satan thinks he's
[1:21:05] got something oh and when he has come he
[1:21:08] findeth empty swept and garnished
[1:21:12] cleaned sanctification means what
[1:21:15] cleaned and set aside for service not in
[1:21:18] service because I've told you a thousand
[1:21:22] times sanctification is the best place
[1:21:25] to be and it's the absolute worst to
[1:21:29] stay that way
[1:21:30] you stay in that God Satan is going to
[1:21:33] make you think you're born again that's
[1:21:35] where a lot of people in this message is
[1:21:37] I'm sorry by the way they act and the
[1:21:38] way they do I'm sorry they might be
[1:21:41] foolish virgins but you know what that's
[1:21:43] between them and God then go with he and
[1:21:48] take you with him seven other spirits
[1:21:49] more wicked than himself so where was
[1:21:53] that that spirit brings some more wicked
[1:21:57] than himself where was he right there
[1:22:00] this is a guy we talk about right here
[1:22:02] okay and they enter in and dwell there
[1:22:07] and the last state of that man is worse
[1:22:13] than the first even so shall it be also
[1:22:18] unto this wicked generation so that's
[1:22:23] what do they do it they're getting a
[1:22:24] good sanctified condition like brother
[1:22:26] Dale's preaching if you can't let me
[1:22:29] just be real real straight with you if
[1:22:33] your pastors not born again you can't
[1:22:36] get born again you can only go as high
[1:22:41] as your pastor I'm just telling you what
[1:22:43] the prophecy it may is that right what
[1:22:46] he said that's why man can preach thirty
[1:22:51] years and preach this message and
[1:22:52] standing that pulpit or knowing it by
[1:22:54] God come on brothers anointed by God and
[1:22:59] then all of a sudden go prophets wrong
[1:23:02] you can't do that and be born again you
[1:23:07] can't deny the Word of God and be born
[1:23:09] again you can have some confusion
[1:23:11] absolutely but you can't just didn't
[1:23:14] ah and walk away from Ivan that's what I
[1:23:17] want to ask Geoff Jenkins one day I'm
[1:23:19] sorry he's named Valentin everybody
[1:23:20] knows I want to ask you f Jenkins I see
[1:23:22] you buried hundreds of people under this
[1:23:25] message you baptized
[1:23:30] hundreds of people under this message
[1:23:33] now you're saying it's all false what
[1:23:40] about the people they died under your
[1:23:45] ministry thinking thinking you had it
[1:23:50] and you didn't we hadn't dealt with ink
[1:23:57] well we are now you know the unclean
[1:23:59] spirits are a lot stronger they're not
[1:24:04] just putting out false doctrine out
[1:24:05] there just going completely against the
[1:24:07] message they're just blasting it out but
[1:24:09] what about the people what about the
[1:24:11] people in the congregation that built
[1:24:13] their whole life on this message you
[1:24:15] can't tell me that man was born again
[1:24:17] now he might have been sanctified that
[1:24:19] unclean spirit went out but he came back
[1:24:24] listen if you were a drunk and that
[1:24:28] unclean spirit went out he's not gonna
[1:24:29] bring seven more drunk spirits
[1:24:31] he's gonna say I didn't get him the
[1:24:33] first time but I'll get him the second
[1:24:35] time I'm gonna bring some of my
[1:24:36] religious buddies with me and I'm gonna
[1:24:39] make him worse seven times worse than
[1:24:43] the first
[1:24:45] brother Brown calls them a 2-fold more
[1:24:47] child of hell and then so you think it's
[1:24:51] really sweet that we get up here and we
[1:24:52] talking we all right yeah you wouldn't
[1:24:55] love to be no preacher I promise you
[1:24:56] that what brother Lewis had to bring I
[1:25:00] mean look listen to what listen what
[1:25:02] Jesus said jesus said if you don't force
[1:25:03] a father mother sister brother God I'm
[1:25:08] going to a funeral today to bury my kin
[1:25:11] you should let the dead bury the dead
[1:25:16] what the brother nail told you that
[1:25:18] somebody died your family and you're
[1:25:20] going to bake what's the dead better
[1:25:22] dead you need to be in church Kingdom
[1:25:26] Garth taken by force Wow sweet old Jesus
[1:25:35] platen ropes driving people out of a
[1:25:39] temple and he planted them so it took
[1:25:43] him a while he didn't just pick
[1:25:46] something up and fit a rage no he
[1:25:49] planted him a rope he said when I get
[1:25:52] this thing down to the end I'm going to
[1:25:53] work it man
[1:25:56] so sometimes we think well you know the
[1:25:58] the Spirit of God is meek it is and it
[1:26:01] makes you a Meeker person but still
[1:26:02] there's a time when it has to raise up
[1:26:05] and it has to fight because Satan is a
[1:26:08] fight or two but remember if you take
[1:26:14] that situation right there and leave it
[1:26:15] the way it is you're in bad shape but
[1:26:19] every one of us has to go through that
[1:26:22] every person that's born again has got
[1:26:25] to go through that right there why is it
[1:26:29] in the Bible I'll read you 100 quotes
[1:26:32] for brother Graham talks about that
[1:26:33] coming out the unclean spirit going out
[1:26:34] 20 calls him sometimes a two full more
[1:26:36] child to hell he knew what would happen
[1:26:38] listen him being a prophet he saw these
[1:26:41] things leave people
[1:26:43] he literally saw him sister I see you've
[1:26:48] got an evil spirit let us pray sister
[1:26:50] the evil spirits gone from you why he
[1:26:52] saw that thing leave but you know what
[1:26:57] he says though remember remember when
[1:26:58] the the maniac remember the maniac
[1:27:02] remember he fell there brother Brown's
[1:27:04] feet but brother brother said that
[1:27:06] spirit came back homey because he loved
[1:27:09] that spirit see now that guy was at a
[1:27:12] place where I believe that that if he
[1:27:14] would have accepted Christ he'd have
[1:27:15] been okay don't you think the unclean
[1:27:18] spirit went out it left him but what'd
[1:27:21] he do he's not gonna like that thing
[1:27:24] that's why we understand chief occasion
[1:27:28] there's a lot of things that we'll talk
[1:27:30] about some Sunday there's a lot of
[1:27:32] things that goes on but one thing's for
[1:27:33] sure it puts you in line of service for
[1:27:39] God that doesn't put you in service but
[1:27:41] it puts you in line for service
[1:27:42] all right let's read this last one and
[1:27:44] then we'll stop right here the contest I
[1:27:48] like this one right here I'd like to
[1:27:51] stand here now lay on to go back through
[1:27:53] the Bible and show you a man back there
[1:27:55] he came face to face with how the
[1:27:56] contest against the enemy they fortified
[1:27:59] themselves by the Word of God no one had
[1:28:02] an experience of it and knew that God
[1:28:03] told him it was gonna rain and the
[1:28:06] contest was on between science than the
[1:28:08] Word of God science says it can't God
[1:28:10] said it will amen
[1:28:12] that same thing exists today it will
[1:28:15] happen it does happen there is devils
[1:28:19] but Jesus cast them out and he gave his
[1:28:22] church authority to do so cast out
[1:28:25] devils in my name he cast Seven Devils
[1:28:27] out of a pretty woman one day and he
[1:28:30] said when the unclean spirit has gone
[1:28:31] out of the man he walks in dry places
[1:28:33] returning back then bringing seven other
[1:28:36] devils with him now brother Browns
[1:28:38] paraphrasing he's not reading exactly
[1:28:39] but once what he says now that goes to
[1:28:41] show that a man was cleaned of Devils
[1:28:44] there was something in him gone out a
[1:28:50] devil had gone out now when the devil
[1:28:53] moved out that God that gives God an
[1:28:57] opportunity oh my an opportunity to move
[1:29:03] in so when he goes out let the Holy
[1:29:08] Spirit come in don't just leave it there
[1:29:12] if you do just repent of your sins and
[1:29:16] go on then you're gonna be worse off
[1:29:18] than ever but get that place where Satan
[1:29:22] once lived good grief
[1:29:25] yes prophet Satan did live in me get it
[1:29:29] filled with the Holy Spirit of God then
[1:29:31] you'll have the strength of God's Word
[1:29:34] in you manifested and cast out devils
[1:29:37] the contest is on so even light shining
[1:29:40] God's Holy Spirit
[1:29:42] is present amen
[1:29:45] let's read Ephesians 5 and then won't
[1:29:47] stay and we'll close right here and then
[1:29:48] I'll pick this up next Sunday Ephesians
[1:29:53] 5:26 oh wait let me read that one wait
[1:29:59] nope I got to continue reading sorry
[1:30:01] sorry guys thank you this is the age of
[1:30:05] life based on my gosh Thank You brothers
[1:30:08] cuz I'd stopped right there I'm sorry
[1:30:11] first this is the age of life personal
[1:30:15] life of Christ were the chemical of his
[1:30:17] body what was him first under
[1:30:19] justification the water baptism second
[1:30:22] under the new birth of Wesley
[1:30:24] sanctification which cleanses and
[1:30:25] thirdly under the baptismal Holy Spirit
[1:30:28] putting that sanctified vessel in the
[1:30:30] service see the word sanctify means it's
[1:30:33] the compound Greek word which means
[1:30:34] cleaned and set aside for service set
[1:30:37] aside for service now the Holy Spirit
[1:30:39] puts it in service and will notice when
[1:30:42] the unclean spirit has gone from a man
[1:30:44] he walks in dry places that's exactly
[1:30:47] what the church has done Baptists
[1:30:49] Methodists those who believe in
[1:30:51] sanctification then jesus said the
[1:30:53] unclean spirit went out returns back to
[1:30:55] this church body Saint they've got a
[1:30:59] problem coming to church gets here for
[1:31:02] you two most time he's here when you're
[1:31:04] not all the time is here when you're not
[1:31:06] unless you took him with him then Jesus
[1:31:09] says the unclean spirits that went out
[1:31:11] returns back to this church body finds
[1:31:14] the house garnished swept clean living
[1:31:17] pure clean all right but then if that
[1:31:22] house isn't filled and occupied then he
[1:31:25] comes in with seven other evil demons
[1:31:27] worse than he is and the last stage of
[1:31:29] this place is 7 times worse than it was
[1:31:32] at the first place they had been better
[1:31:35] to stay Lutheran than it would be to
[1:31:38] receive the light and fail to follow it
[1:31:42] so will the Pentecostals say you know
[1:31:45] what I mean the house is garnished now
[1:31:49] let's read Ephesians 5 then let's see
[1:31:50] right here we're gonna stop features 5
[1:31:53] verse 26 this is God speaking that he
[1:31:55] might
[1:31:56] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[1:31:58] of water by the word that he might
[1:32:02] present it to himself he's not even
[1:32:06] going to trust anybody else to present
[1:32:07] us he's going to present himself he's
[1:32:10] the presenter he's going to present it
[1:32:12] to himself a glorious church not having
[1:32:15] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[1:32:18] that it should be holy and without
[1:32:21] blemish that red heifer without blemish
[1:32:27] in that Old Testament was a type of you
[1:32:30] and I in the end time coming under the
[1:32:33] waters of separation washing of the
[1:32:35] water by the word now they only had so
[1:32:37] much word to go on but we're talking
[1:32:39] about this this second part of
[1:32:42] sanctification this super sanctification
[1:32:45] because you shut already unless an
[1:32:48] unclean spirit should already be gone if
[1:32:49] you're born again it will be gone if
[1:32:51] you're born again amen then you've got
[1:32:55] to go back here now you got to go back
[1:32:57] to here why because there's doors in
[1:33:00] doors there's little demons big demons
[1:33:05] gone Satan but there's little demons
[1:33:08] that what memory reason there's five
[1:33:10] doors we have said this before memory
[1:33:15] reason memory where's it that where do
[1:33:18] you reason conscious affection
[1:33:22] imagination that's all right here where
[1:33:24] I'm pointing it's not down here it's
[1:33:26] right here that's the sanctification I'm
[1:33:30] talking about the unclean spirits still
[1:33:32] hear the little demons the little demons
[1:33:36] big demons not in me no more I ain't
[1:33:39] worried by big demon little demons is
[1:33:42] what I'm worried about this set on my
[1:33:43] shoulder and say you need to do
[1:33:46] so-and-so to your brother because I
[1:33:48] think he's talking about you I think
[1:33:51] he's doing there I think he's doing that
[1:33:58] Satan when you mouth is moving your life
[1:34:04] even when Satan is telling the truth
[1:34:06] he's lying even when the devil is
[1:34:11] telling the truth good you know what
[1:34:12] he'll tell you so you need to go to
[1:34:13] church
[1:34:13] we ain't lying but I want you to go to
[1:34:16] church and I want you to talk about six
[1:34:18] songs oh brother songs uh-huh hello that
[1:34:21] root of bitterness the property God
[1:34:23] talks about in the words of the church
[1:34:24] that root of bitterness it's not a
[1:34:26] born-again it's not the Holy Ghost
[1:34:30] no that root of bitterness is what you
[1:34:35] talking about this one's on one thing
[1:34:37] remember what brotherly kindness is what
[1:34:39] I when I did the statue a perfect man
[1:34:41] remember I told you brother kindness is
[1:34:43] not down here you got to go through all
[1:34:46] them to get to brotherly kindness right
[1:34:48] before the headstone come that must be
[1:34:52] pretty rough goes down here it's real
[1:34:55] wide a lot of people make it it just
[1:34:57] keeps going narrow and there were never
[1:35:01] because they remember what Billy Paul
[1:35:03] said about brother Branham he said I
[1:35:05] didn't know who daddy's enemies her
[1:35:06] friends were now I'll promise you one
[1:35:08] thing that ain't happened to me yet and
[1:35:16] the congregation says amen
[1:35:19] then ain't happened to me yet so he's
[1:35:23] still working on me the little demon
[1:35:26] this sits right here on the shoulder he
[1:35:27] can't get in me but he can sit right
[1:35:28] here and talk through these what he can
[1:35:30] talk through these inlets too right here
[1:35:33] he can't talk to this but what this has
[1:35:36] got to do is it say Satan I did not hold
[1:35:40] that I did not all that he's still
[1:35:44] working on me to make me 100 to be let's
[1:35:48] stand our feet that's why these seals
[1:35:52] listen if we just took this thing as a
[1:35:54] red horse rider and he was killing
[1:35:57] people in the Dark Ages and he was given
[1:35:59] a sword which is a word he was given a
[1:36:01] word to go by see that's putting it out
[1:36:06] there I just gave it to you in your
[1:36:09] house in your vessel
[1:36:14] you have to twist afternnon in your
[1:36:16] vessel to be sanctified
[1:36:20] well if louisa give his songs right if
[1:36:29] dick had playing the right key I mean
[1:36:40] really I'm just telling you worthless
[1:36:42] human being but you watch as we go up
[1:36:46] through this statue a perfect man though
[1:36:47] it is the waters of separation because
[1:36:49] there's only a certain group of people
[1:36:50] that water separation didn't clean
[1:36:53] everybody some people didn't want it
[1:36:57] listen all of Israel now we know all of
[1:37:01] Israel is going to be saved though that
[1:37:03] has the 144,000 we know that but Israel
[1:37:06] nominal will not be safe unless they get
[1:37:09] the new birth of Israel nominal it's
[1:37:12] just that and then went over there
[1:37:14] several years ago they're just as bad as
[1:37:16] we are
[1:37:16] they have murders they have prostitutes
[1:37:19] they have all these things the Jewish
[1:37:21] Kingdom ours I'm sorry the the children
[1:37:23] of Israel are the 144,000 the children
[1:37:27] of Israel Jacob and they're scattered
[1:37:30] the scattered everywhere right now but
[1:37:33] there's going to be 144,000 come in and
[1:37:35] accept this message the problem is we're
[1:37:43] not the problem the good thing is them
[1:37:45] two prophets we're not gonna have to
[1:37:46] spend 40 years explaining one God they
[1:37:52] know that there's only one God remember
[1:37:55] what to ask brother groundmass gets it
[1:37:57] will wholly be so he'd be beside who
[1:37:58] will that be said it'll be God they know
[1:38:01] that because remember it's only gonna
[1:38:03] take three and a half years for them to
[1:38:05] get justified sanctified filled with the
[1:38:08] Holy Ghost part of the wave statute pray
[1:38:10] for whatever you want to say they've got
[1:38:12] to be mature cuz they're gonna leave
[1:38:13] this place
[1:38:14] amen I know they'll be killed but still
[1:38:16] they still they're not they're going to
[1:38:20] be killed by their own brethren I've
[1:38:21] told you that they're gonna be killed

[1:38:41] seal Jews killed Eichmann and Hitler why
