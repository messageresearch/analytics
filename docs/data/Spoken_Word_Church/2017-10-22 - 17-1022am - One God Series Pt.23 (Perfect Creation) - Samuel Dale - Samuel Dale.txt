«  826       †        And--and as he walked through the garden of Eden, first as a theophany (like the Holy Spirit is in here now walking in here), it led the animal life. It controlled everything, but it couldn't till the soil. See? So God put him in flesh so that he could till the soil, give him his five senses to till the soil and fix up the--the vineyards and--and so forth, and then the man still looked lonesome. Oh, this is a beautiful picture.
    Look, for when he was first made, he was made two people together. He was made both male and female; the man was. The Bible said he was. God made man both male and female, "created He him." Notice. Now, when man was separated from the theophany and put in flesh, he was--he wasn't just altogether there; part of his being was still a theophany, so it didn't look right.
    There went the male and female in the cow; there went the horse; and there went the ox; and there went everything else, pairs. But Adam, he... it was... See, there was something lacking. That very crave showed that there was a mate waiting for him. You get it? And the very thoughts that we have to die here, that we're troubled and perplexed, and we long for a Life that has no death, it shows it's waiting for us. See?

«  829       †        And Adam was lonesome. And God, to show that they could not be separated... (Now, I'm going to get back into this same thing, just a second.) Look, He never went and got dirt and made a Eve, but He made from the original dirt: Adam. He took a rib from his side and made him a helpmate, and that was Eve. She was made for the man and part of the man. She was part of him in the beginning in the creation in the theophany. She was part of him down here in this creation. She could not be divided in another creation; she had to be made in the same creation.
    That's exactly why Christ and God had to be the very same Person; it could not be anything different. If He'd been...

ready everybody get everything and they're supposed to meet when today 1 o'clock to get everything together to see and everything going this like it was going before except a few added things to to be

just ask you to come on the scene and be in each one of our hearts and lives and to forgive our sins and cleanse us help us to walk in you and then to guide us in the understanding of your word because knowing that you and your word or one then as we're receiving the word we're receiving you into our hearts and our lives we love you and we thank you goddess name keep us in Jesus name John 1:1 in the beginning was the word Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was a lot of men and a light shining in darkness and the darkness comprehended at night there's no way darkness can put out light there's no way it can comprehend what even light is okay so now we'll go to Genesis 2 and we'll start reading at verse 18 and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him an help meet for him and notice everybody if you read that 90% of the people are gonna read ma te that is not dire that is not the word ma te that's the word M EE T okay now listen this is what I always read it to when we're done when I do a waiting always read this scripture because I want the bride and the groom to understand what this is this is an out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field they were follow the hour era and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatever Adam called then called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all the cattle and to the fowl of the air every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him when the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of maan now why would she call a woman because she was taken out of the man brother Maloney said if you went back I remember that and back in the original and try to get all the original time together here that you'd see that what that saying is the man now has a wound to reproduce himself so that's that's a good point all right and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh you may be seated Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word I want to try to continue the thought that we were bringing in Wednesday and bring it more into clarity but I want you to follow one point through the message today we've been in this message quite a while and you know mankind has went this way and went thattaway and then all kind of things and he has his own idea about what he thinks he sees but he don't take it and put it together in all the word all right and you hear a lot and the preachers will preach about it and they'll preach about a woman being a byproduct and all of their things they'll be rated relating you watch it it'll be down sizing the woman from the position that the Bible puts are in and trying to bring her to a position of something of lesser value now if I don't get nothing to you today listen why you awake she was taken from Adam whatever Adam was she was okay is that clear now brother branham said we'll read it in a minute that she was in him in theophany huh and he said she was in him in flesh all right then get it correctly because now I don't defend women you know to say well you know he just - he just - no he's got hook in his nose and you know his wife leaves him ground so he preaches try to defend women well now what are you gonna do trying to talk about the Bride of Christ that's all I ask are you gonna make the Bride of Christ or lower value I want to see that I want to see it in the Word of God that you can down the wife the Bride of Christ and maker of some lower value that's just you can call it what you want to I don't care it cause that's the way I've always been you know the people of this may see did I say they think the man is a big porterhouse steak you know the woman's a little old hamburgers you know yeah I'd like to see that in the Word of God and the prophets message but the truth will set us free I'm talking about the Bride of Christ right all right coming out to the Bride of Christ and what she is she's him in another form now you go with your by-product all you want to but go back and look up the word by-product well it just means something no show me where it means something of lesser value it's something off of the other it doesn't say lesser value it's something off of the other uh-huh in illustrating we we're in a day when you call it what they call that word now for medicine generic is that the word generic alright see we think generic people say I don't want generic I won't I want original you don't even know what you're talking about generic is the original just made to where they can get by all the gloves and the pipes and the things that they had the price to control it for 10 or 15 years then you can make a generic off of that and people are saying they're generics don't do me no good you're taking the same identical vitamins here whatever this within it it's the same but it says what we got in their mind you know in our mind we thought generic is so these was made out of this over here needs money they made the same you just this when you get a patent on the medicine after so many years nobody can't copy that but after so many years they can make the same thing in a generic value think of the human being like that and the things of what we're talking about besides I got it written down to just make this statement up front how can God make anything imperfect now that's the text of the hotel how can God make anything imperfect you can show me how you can make it imperfect then we'll just stop the whole thing because he can't condemn us for being sinners see people who say well God made me this way I can't help it then they'll try to figure out something for the woman that comes in a situation that would make her of some thing that was made deliberately to do this that or the other and when you do you might got guilty of making that thing wrong okay that's the whole point now of the message all right so you go to sleep turn off your brains and do whatever but we've been trying for the past couple of services to get one point across Adam was God's original creation right first one okay humanly speaking he had made the other things and all that come down then he made man all right and Adam was made first a spiritual being to be the 1:26 man you know let us make man I mean he was made in that in a spiritual creation right then he was made into a physical creation in Genesis 2:7 all right putting that 1:26 man into the 2:7 you see Adam standing there the way God wanted all of his offspring to come forth are you with me Adam was the example because he was the first the first is always the example and that's why I was emphasizing in the message you know Wednesday that God doesn't begin a creation as a baby you know he begins a creation full-grown Adam was full-grown he was a man all right he wasn't a baby and then the years later he finally grown up and know God's original creation the beginning of any creation will automatically be full-grown right did you follow that one he so then we talked about the church on the debt pending college at the life see they came forward full-grown not babies full-grown 120 right they came forward they've had a couple cities I just said well that Judas was in the upper room I was talking about the upper room of the supper not the upper room of the point where the Holy Ghost fail all right but I'm glad you're at least listening so that does he play close attention I hope so I'm not upset because you said I'm glad you do because you're listening all right and that way you keep from being misunderstood if you tell me you know I said well hey brother Dale you said it otherwise oh I don't mind saying I can I can say I'm sorry and wrong there's no problem all right but see now Adam being God's example son he was what God wanted ever one of his children his offspring to be like okay now but we know that that did not transpire that way you know it did in the fact of Adam being created in that part all right then you'd have the eve coming with the same situation as Adam and being fine and perfect in creation not eternal in body now when you say perfect I don't mean always see does it differ between WordPerfect and eternal God created Adams body perfect but not eternal right all right so keep that in your mind of what we're talking about all right but you remember the thought I was trying to make Wednesday night about Adam being the example son but it was never going to come forth God knew we were going to follow he knew that if he made man on free moral agency that was all he had to do he didn't have to make him some way or design in some way that's what everybody said about the woman she she was made and designed be careful how you get that design you know be careful how you use a lot of the things like a brother got onto me one time he said you're talking about you know ear barbs and stuff like that then I said well you know what then women in the Old Testament warrior box with us it's wrong for us to where I'm gonna happen cuz we know the story but they wore them back then didn't he he said well the reason I am said you're talking about jewelry and stones said the devil that's in stones I said that's true that's right he's beautiful the way he was made and described as that diamonds and you know but you know what so was the breastplate of Aaron and God was designed in stone and diamonds and time so this don't run off and say well we got this you know get the whole story and then we can understand okay now so then what we were talking about why didn't God just create Adam and Eve create the rest of us that would have been his offspring and place to star in the garden and everything and no devil involved you realize that would have been a beautiful story wouldn't it we would worship Him as our Father we would have been happy about to call him daddy you know father we see we know the rest of the story that God had attributes that he was going to see displayed well now but remember attributes cannot be a deliberate making of sin there is no attribute of sin that would not to a Christian now everything else is that you know what god never made anything wrong so everything he ever made is made perfect all right you said he made a perfect Center no no no he didn't make no Center we done the CNN okay now but you see why didn't God just leave it as to put it in a situation like that we said well it was because he had attributes well no that's good but now are you going to take the attributes and make it change God's original plan you realize if that my point is if God was going to have a million offspring you know when sinnard the picture he didn't gain any more offspring but neither did he lose anything right you can't do that now you're playing your games in your head but not think about it wouldn't it have been wonderful to leave it there would have been no sin there would've been no heartaches no trouble you remember what I was trying to bring out Wednesday night I hope you go back and listen to it you see you and I would have been spoiled brats too we would have been little old spoiled brats that it would have been nothing involved in it would have had nothing to do with anything we was just been thrown out Dyer and left at that situation but you see a true Christian I said a true Christian loves God because even though he puts us through trials and troubles and heartaches for our perfection we love him because he done you not tell you what I don't love him called sin you ain't never heard well you you just don't do it sit up to a lady one time you know the Bible said all things work together for good well how could it work together when I got a dead husband there I said you're not getting the Bible the Bible said all things work together so now you're gonna change your thoughts see that's what I was trying to get at Wednesday night of the point you realize by coming the way we came in the fall it brains and I'll keep using that word to make it right because it brings a true Christian a true child and a son and daughter of God down to a greater understanding of God in his ways and his how he does things and what he is and his nature and everything whole lot greater that it would have been if they had never been a fouled and hadn't been none of these conditions so now which one was God's original plan was his original plan did this brought us into being you know no sin no problem honor no that could have been his original plan cuz these attributes that he had had his original plan in his mind to come the way we came right you can't make that he brought us wrong and then we're gonna take that make us right no he knew from the beginning when he created us brother Ron said he knew if he gave us free moral agency we would follow right well I don't mean man a woman either woman now that's all of us but are you are you got with me with this out that's trying to brain then we'll try to get into a point that this is God's original plan in way is being displayed now this is what he wanted he just didn't want sons and daughters he wanted sons and daughters listen because this was growing lighter for messages down the road he wanted his children to have his nature right no she wants your children to have your nature then we get rid of the bad parts right you know okay but there's at least something there that you'd like for your kids to have your nature because that's what it is and God's nature is what he's trying to display that's what I was trying to explain to you a few weeks ago that how can you see the soul of God through the Old Testament you followed a body in a couple of places you can follow the spirit of mourning mankind witnesses mention of his soul you know what I mean by mankind David then we get into it and it's old longing after God what is that the soul is the nature of the spirit so then God wants his nature displayed you remember how we were bringing it out in the Old Testament who was it it took care of them people that wouldn't wouldn't kill him when they done wrong sure a lot of them died but a lot of them was preserved by the nature of God being on display right okay well then why can't we see the whole thing is God's nature the whole creation of mankind all that's involved is bringing out his nature and displaying it you could find what God is like by his creation that's what we're talking about today perfect creation made the way God wanted it okay doing that we've been dealing for quite a while to make sure you stay with the correct point God's original creation was Adam in the way he was brought into being all right so he brought him first into being as the 1:26 man Dhiru that you know the garden and everything he was all but then you come into the 2:7 man well remember the 1:26 man can't be any different if you put him in flesh that's why I kept emphasizing to you there's no way for that 1:26 and 27 man to fall there's no sin in the 1:26 ma'am there's no sin in the one 26 and 27 nothing no no that person can't follow because that's eternal life because that's what's your profit we spent weeks and weeks and weeks describing those things how brother Branham was bringing out the things of eternal life and all the things we went service after service and I still got it here because see what it does the reason I bring a lot of the things they put them on the internet all right they put the quotes on the internet so then somebody ain't just listening to us and and not being able to follow and know where everything's that I give them the quotes on the internet even if even if I don't read them in the service they're placed on the internet where the people can take that and read it huh see so over and over and over we've been describing one we're brother Brown were talking about in blasphemous names 1962 that he's talking about how God breathed into the nostrils of Adam and he became a living soul he said he breed eternal life so God's original plan and started out not as a lost sinner or even a neutral situation that would put it to be you know there's just no value part he started original creation out with eternal life in his soul you said but I don't see how that could be done well then you just go argue with God about it and you talk to your prophet and see it was eternal life not just as we've called some nature doing something it was God giving eternal life to Adam in his soul become a living soul he said all right you say but brother Adam Adam died I said this word I mean to the blaspheme this night he said but before Adam died said he had a lamb now what was important that I'm making listen to this statement you say Adam failed but the lamb was provided for Adam because already in the nostrils had become the breath of the eternal God already in the nostrils had become the breath of eternal life in the Adam alright see then that could not fall as we went through showing it in the sealed book where bread around said that Adam fell from eternal life to death but he never fell to death like we talked about death and nothing he felt as we do talk about death just naturally dying he never lost his eternal life you can't take that back once God gives you something he can't take it back all right so then brought around said especially into Adam he breathe life and Adam became an eternal person with God an amateur God right so when he was put into 2:7 and flesh that flesh man had ruled of the garden we can talk about the spirit man heaven rule but the flash man had rule in the garden right I know it was mentioned another day about some you know he's brought up about that well it was said to Adam you know in there about tilling the soil tilling the ground you know he controlled the earth we'll remember before the foul he wasn't plowing with a mule and working he was just moving trees and doing what he wanted to do because he was that the taker care of the garden but when the fall came then the Bible said by the sweat of your brow he would have to make his living so there's a difference between the point see it was given to Adam because Adam would have been ruler of the earth and he could do as he wanted to and he can call it the Bible calls it that he would no man to till the soil he said well then he must have been a going tell it well everyone had a woman to do with it whatever God wanted to be done with it in the garden Adam could have done it but it's not not horrible it'd be a wonderful thing it'll be a wonderful thing one day when we're in the in the future hole if we don't want that tree that I witness a tree move see we don't think about everything being labor and sweat not when the sin entered it becomes the sweat of your brow before it wasn't but now don't never get into don't ever get into let's see who in it I won't state it so but there's a group that believes that what we're doing here a big church do that here we are and one day God this comes down and takes over well one day we're slaving and struggling and going to General Motors and building cars and fussing and stewing and sweating the next day we're happy because that's the way they describe heaven they've heard it they describe heaven as to be one day you're sad a next day everybody's happy we still building cars I don't know who we're gonna sell them to but that's their doctrine that's that's a great message I mean a great group of people in the religious realm well I don't think it's that away I just think that we we were put here for the purpose all right now then getting to the point that we want to start with today because we want to talk about a perfect creation not eternal creation cuz there's no such thing there's no such thing as an eternal something when you talk about creation creation means it has a beginning you say well you turn alive I fried it spice down to you you know but it has of time that it comes into you - we'll get to that one these days all right now don't talk about the eternal creations just leave that alone just forget it leave it to the point that God is going to achieve on earth what he desired was a whole point of Wednesday night see what he desired and he desired to fulfill all of his attributes right so then it would mean that Satan would enter the picture the tree of knowledge was already in the garden everything was not ready and it was going to be that away all right now in doing that then it would leave that man as I said the 1:26 man we can see that he's the spirit man our spiritual child or a son of God or whatever daughter you know within the two-seven and that's why I love wordings the way it is and the things hue it says because right around them go ahead and let's read this number two because we want to get that point from the message adoption 1960 just wants you to get the point of what brother Branham will put them together Wow sis before we go any further Genesis 1:26 I'll pick it up Wednesday when God made man now watch him before he made man before he made man he called himself el Li la la Elohim the word means in the Hebrew the self-existing this does huh all by himself nothing existed before him he was all the existence there ever was self-existence 1l lol ahem means the all-sufficient all-powerful almighty self existent one all right so the 1:26 and 27 man was a part of that that's just what he's explaining that's a part of God all right now watch but in Genesis 2 he made a man he said giving all them what ye h UJ u vu h and why you and Jehovah what did it mean I am the all existence one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine now he's got him in flash he's into Jehovah means that he gave the man to be an amateur God I like that one Jehovah means now you get it down here what he said Jehovah means is like a father with his family but what's he giving you the definition what is Jehovah it means he gave man to be an amateur God so we're tied up into the name of Jehovah right because he's father God he made a man an amateur God so he isn't self existence anymore he exists with his family that's what I love he's got the Elohim enough so now he is Jehovah Jehovah means the one who exists with his family Jehovah the one who once existed in self existence but now exists with his family and his little ones with him how a more wonderful could a man with no education describe an eternal God and be it so you following me see then the genesis to man a Genesis one man is a part of God Jesus is to man is a creation of God he just simply puts the 1:26 and 27 into the two seven so that's blasphemous name he breathed into his nostrils and he became an eternal person well Adam couldn't die from that eternal life in his soul well Eve was in Adam in theophany and she still stayed in theophany and Adam put on down and coming towards flash them according brother branham you want to read him for the questions and answers on Hebrews Eve was a part of Adam brother Branham says in theophany and cities when she was a part of Adam in flesh and listen in that is a quote where brother branham said that Genesis to man in other words he's ruler of the earth because the 126 is in two to seven right so he's ruler of the earth he said one day his sons and daughters will come to that same thing again now there's you statue of perfect man sons and daughters are going to come to that right back to that situation that Adam and Eve existed while they were in the garden he's old that'll never happen well it may not be but if just a minute but it's gonna be all right cause your prophet said it would okay do we believe him to be a prophet like that if he said it that's what it's gonna be but Eve was in Adam in theophany he said one put in flesh and one in theophany questions and answers on Hebrews so Eve had a part of God - she was 126 man because it says in the 126 man what let us make man in our own image and let them not just the man them man and woman right so Eve had a right listen well as anybody else that's why I've always said new sisters to doubt the point that you God gave you eternal life that that eternal life you have is not as sufficient as the eternal life given to a man hey we know the story the woman stays out of the pulpit she stays out of running that part but she had her own pulpits you can preach to her children right she can testify to one another they'll never belittle what you've got well I know what I'm just nuts well now you're trying you're propping up your excuses it you do and you just coming up to the point of saying well I can't produce it well I'm not supposed to produce it because it's only for the man now there's no quote in the Bible there is no prophets quote for that filly it's short to me I don't mind making statements like that why because it would tie up to all of the word if it loves the eternal life you have is just as good as the eternal out of the man hash okay one would be in What's in flesh the other one was still left in theophany and brother Branham now here's what's going to get to us in I mean right around said Adam was lonely that's where we read that scripture Adam was lonely saying why would Adam lonely hmm mysterious why was that him lonely he could look at the animals and he could see the male and the female right and he thought well why don't I have a another hive you know why it was lonely cuz he had one hey what you looking at the animal right I said something with prop up stories with what he was looking at the animals he had with inside of him what he wanted outside of him where he could contact it right he was lonely you know what brother Brown said about that too he said as Adam was lonely he said God was lonely too why was God lonely now dude he didn't have a lot to do and a whole lot of things could keep him entertained it was the fact that there was something missing that he couldn't fellowship with why because it was in him he was in the end and he was lonely too okay so you can do a lot of preaching with a lot of things but now listen he then she being part of him brother Brennan says in the beginning in the creation in the theophany I'm reading it from paragraph 829 and she was put and she was part of him down here in this creation she could not be divided into another creation she had to be made the same creation yeah so now what does it mean by product well we got that out by product did it as they were nothing I won't get regional see we have all that like one brother one time he said brother offered him some seedless grapes he said don't I ain't gonna eat no seedless grapes ain't gonna eat nothing got no seed in it where did that great come from that was seedless from a seed right you get it the seed looks great somewhere had a seed that developed down then they further away can describe the process or what they do with it and they got to do certain things over here and this has got to be done over here and it's got to do that and it finally comes down to no seed we see it point was they can't reproduce itself it's all right but listen Eve was in Adam and that's what made Adam lonely now no animal I listen what do we do we got the whole story we study the prophets we know what he created everyone male and female right ever animal was created male and female right but when it come to the human race he only created a male well he said well she come out then as if I product but you don't listen to the things that the Prophet says about it you listening to what you want to listen to in your own mind that you've been taught by these great glorious preachers that you love because they make you shout and glory Alleluia and run the aisles and when you go home you don't even know what they told let alone whether it's right or not that's no business of mine that's yours no but yet I had him being lonely was because he was in him where was she coming from now God have identified this theophany part for Eve right because he was still in theophany but in Adam when he was created now are you with me Eve was in Adam when Adam was created if not words come from since what I'm saying you got by product like I told you I don't like these jokes the preachers might you know and they'll say that warmish ain't nothing but a by-product so you take her to Walmart and she'll buy of a product in there I think that's close to blasphemy now that's as straight as I am that's close to blaspheming because you're making the woman to be degraded that's the whole purpose of mankind and the preaching sounds like it we just remember one thing if you don't remember nothing else and you think about how sorry women are you just remember there is a Bride of Christ now you are throwing off on her dip yourself you're degrading her wouldn't that turn out to be blaspheming if you're degrading something God made that's blaspheming so do what you want to I don't get along too good with people anyway and I never tried to but I try to do one thing it's try to tell you the truth there's plain as I can where you can think about it to say buy product is not buy products is one old model T Donny's got one down there old model T they love him time they're on rent on me I do too could we kid with a different you know and all that the sparks in the answer but if we going to California don't put me in a Model T when I got a brand-new Ford sitting there right don't put me in the Model T now we got two brand-new forward well you know what to write what the Model T Model T come over something else the brand-new Ford is a bi-product off the Model T the best way you can do with an old model T it's a horse and buggy I guess I don't know what you do because it's the horsepower it's this power at all I always never haven't wondered that all these rocket this end out in space they'll tell you how many horsepower that that Rockets got well I reckon it's because they started out with figuring how much one horse could pull or something I don't know but are you with me where are you going to find a by-product as being something wrong any byproducts you can think of means it comes off of you only get it in Webster it means it comes off of and there is a dictionary somewhere that you'll find that it says even a by-product now quoted it for years it's of equal value because it is the Model T the brand-new Ford is of greater value right but it's the same value it's the same horses the same metal it's the same things now if they've come from atom not as an original creation that's what a statement want to go in the animal kingdom there's no such thing as a by-product animal kingdom right male female male female male female there's no by-product in the animal kingdom that's because God created the male and he created the female well don't you think it's greater that instead of taking atom standing there and reaching over and getting a handful of clay and made Eve he took part of atom which was a perfect creation right Adams body was created perfect come on you agreed with that while ago but don't always agree with me if you don't do it on his legs somewhere down the Mesa to be reminded of better randomly emphasizes the eve was not taken from another lump she was taken from Adam as a by-product now change the wording to where you'll think about Eve was she not a part of Adam no he removed rib made Eve that made her part of Adam and Adam said she is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh she shall be called a woman you didn't get the word eve until she fell come on read you Bible she didn't get that letter I mean that name Eve until she fell because that name Eve says mother of all living at the time Adam in his creation and even her creation there was no children no offspring she was the mother of what would have come from Adam at that time that would have been the point but it's not that she's just a woman are you following me trying to get to a point to get you away from the thoughts of a byproduct being something of lesser value types and any types what do you got you got to boat up you got a flogged rolled in and took you down two logs and you made it and fixed him a boat that's the top then the top is greater ocean liner run down through the ocean now which one do you think is greater which one would you rather have for selling purposes the old model tees all right you probably get more for the old model T and you get for a brand new forward that but we're not trying to sell anything we're trying to realize what's taking place that God created everything perfect and he could not create anything imperfect yes but brother Dale I still think by-product ain't as good as a regional don't try to talk to me about it then I'll keep my I don't I don't see overlay man okay but I'll keep my mind heater and an air conditioner and all in pain and then icing on it and driving across the country and I we used to be in the mold Model T's which one what is the Model T before one of them but anyhow I remember they had to break selling brakes a head-on was a leather band twisted around the driveshaft that was first original brakes you won't go back okay well we buy product God started out the way he wanted it with his children now listen you realized in what I'm saying a by-product of that that he started out with will finish up in this last days in a bride that will walk up on this earth for a short time as ruler of this earth now if you want to call it by-product you're throwing a lot do head but see the reason is because the man is the man like my mother used to say she said a man said he can get out and commit adultery he can do everything in the book said he puts on his suit and he goes to church and said he'd called a brother did a woman go out and have adultery one man she's a prostitute and a everything else for the rest of her life because everybody remembers it she's never a sister is that the way you think about and hey sister don't get all build up about it cuz I'm bragging on you I'm talking about a Bride of Christ because hey I thought we was all in the Bride of Christ I thought we men was in the Bride of Christ I thought that's what we was was Christ in His Church within that put us all to be the same Hey we know the story like we know the woman don't get in the pulpit to preach right we got the story well I thought you might be slipping a little bit over on it no when I started going hi honey how you do it you can talk about being slipping or this one probably when I've done that on internet I did learn that in the way back here to go and the kids and say that personal desires not so what is that and they finally described it I didn't know okay get off of that okay listen talking about why would it say in Genesis let me get to the point of this why did it say in Genesis that I'll make him a helpmeet I'm telling you walk out of this building go across the street go anywhere you want to and say a helpmeet and they'll corrects you in a hurry and tell you it's a helpmate because that's what grandma called it and grandpa called it and they called it my mom used to call it Chattanooga but I don't know how to say Chattanooga old brother Ratliff used to say Lou you go down to Lulu we don't have to call it Lulu right but why does it say help meat and not make okay brothers get on over them - I don't I've marked it off but it's number five supposed to be in you get to number six we'll roll it back it up Genesis 2:18 and I will make him an help meet for him I'll make him a helpmate what does that word meet the definition because with Strong's Concordance 5828 it means to help to succor you know you know where do you sympathize with somebody you put up with it you sucker you kind of put on you go along with it okay help sucker one who helps alright that's the word meat okay mate is only missing two times in the Bible so we'll go ahead to number seven we'll pick up that from Isaiah 34 and 615 he's talking about her out in the nest and the different things he told me everyone with her mate alright the Hebrew letter comes strong 74 68 the word mate means a female companion it means an a mate it means a neighbor woman and you got it this sounds good female companion that's in Brazil and I asked him what did wedding mean code they got us messed up you've heard the story where I call that sister a a hamburger and I say in meat and the brother was interpreted mate and they was dying laugh and I said Billy you messed up somewhere we stopped the whole thing cuz I knew he wouldn't interpret in what I say it when I said what did you interfere he said I interpreted mate that's what it is I said ain't in the Bible Billy yeah get your Bible we look in front of 300 people let's get your Bible your folks have been reading what I read I said what'd he say he said I've never seen that it says meet and I asked him what was wedding in their terminologies you know what they call it a companion he said well that's good to be good for their language not good for our language right a female companion okay we're in the part of the legends and we're out in the part of the homosexuals and we're in the part of all these things it's all messed up right and what does it mean when it says a mate it can be a neighbor's a neighbor woman now you know what that means don't you it means that you're running around with the neighbor the word mate is not in the Bible there in Genesis it's meet because she's a sucker she's a sympathizer with her with him she's a helper she's actually heal made manifest in another forum will you go that way the wife is the husband in another form I thought we spoke to be one and the twain shall be one you get what I mean you read it mate you can say it's a female companion a prostitute or anything you want to put in there a neighbour woman but the word em eet roll it back to that one now up or down every way y'all go always telling the wrong way okay and what does it mean the word meat is to help to succor understand be sympathetic right help sugar one of the helps well because she's part of you what is the Bride of Christ is it not that she is him in another form called the bride sons and daughters of God our God in another form called a bride that's where you men order wake up you know you can talk about this now the other but just remember when you put that woman in that I'm telling them preachers out there on the Internet is listening we've got to borrow blush go all right you put it by product didn't what have you got you're not making her a part of him and you're talking about the bride of Jesus Christ so when you're talking about a male and a female according to Paul Paul is describing the husband and wife right the day become one Ryan well you know where the trouble of that thing going become one well I can't help it if the women make their self that way now I'm not responsible for that part we're living in a for men and women boat we're living in a garbage can day if you don't admit to that you're in bad shape when I tell him about the good ones according to Solomon the worst thing a man could get is a woman she's a thousand times more easy to be deceived come on with him and he had a thousand with a real true wife it's part of you he's a part of you she's not a byproduct or something out somewhere through Christianity in the natural reading of the Bible the husband and wife was supposed to be one the natural reading through the spiritual reading the husband and wife has born again Christian is supposed to be one that's why I told my wife years ago see I've never worried about her running around on me I'm entrusting everything else that's fine but this is one thing October could you see one thing and then she ain't never got to worry about me running around on her cuz you know what if we're going in the rapture we're going to make that thing right here we ain't gonna make it right and glory some worry we're gonna make it right here so they ain't no such thing is her committing adultery in thinking she's going in the rapture with me ain't no such thing as me committing adultery think I'm going with her that's how plain brother daily is why it needs to be straight here not cause some people like a priest one time like that and had an opportunity to have a whole lot of money stuck in my pocket because he's afraid his wife is gonna divorce him so he want me to hold that money until he got through telling her about it and he got through telling her about it and he come back so I want money back now so what you mean it's my money you gave it to me didn't you you know I'm saying I give it back but you I'm doing that to be serious not lifing cuz you see Church the husband and wife is a wonderful thing now ever husband and wife is not a type of Christ in the church right now am i right it's only a husband and wife that's right in Jesus Christ is the type of Christ in the church right see that's why we want these things straight here we've got a message that tells us how to straighten up things no okay what are you with me do you want a female companion do you want it to just be a mate does God want just a female companion as a mate when he said meet part of each other remember if it's a true bride and Christ that's who it is husband and wife okay now listen God blessed them Adam and a meet not Adam and a mate right are you following me not Adam in a mate Adam and a meet which would be part of him she was part of him in theophany she was part of him in physical creation they get in a little marriage the divorce went terrible building am I getting empty too but that's alright but you know what before they was put into human flesh 1:26 man show you how perfect it ties to Christ in His Church they were told to multiply and replenish the earth why would God do that before the fall did he do that because it he was going to make them fall are you with me he told him when there's an theophany till now remember the Prophet talked of it a pre-service year while back on it own spiritual multiplication you realize that's what I'm doing I'm preaching the gospel and you are taking the word and that spiritual multiplication become children of God that's why you sisters got your own poop come on come on we put it in the right place right the woman's got their place why I go out and teach them kids and grandkids and great grandkids and and all I can teach the women teach the women why because you were told when you were that back there to multiply and replenish and as you preach the gospel to people at spiritual multiplication now listen folks let me put a coin this plug right here that's why you see so many preachers committing adultery because that thing is so close I warn you ministers that thing it's so close it will take you to the bed of adultery and you will think that you are right and you'll try to justify it I told you about the old man at the dream he had a seed to plant he did in a young girl he was 17 she is like 18 somewhere 67 at least until I told him I said brother I said didn't you understand he said but I had a dream I did I said don't you understand a preacher plants a seed by the words he preaches to the congregation he was told to preach the gospel not to get a very pregnant of course he didn't it did bother you know you know you don't got to do you follow me listen let me finish it up in this part we just closed out that part of it and let it go right around him on the message called souls in prison he said he's talking about the man is spirit being and then there was no man to till the soil and God formed man out of the dust of the earth then he taken from his side a byproduct he did not make a byproduct of lesser value he said he took from his side a by-product a reel which is part of her and from that separated the man which had a dual nature which was both feminine and masculine and he took the feminists out cause it was love and he placed it into a person called Eve and Adam called EE because he knew the story it was put on down now listen what's the difference in a man and a woman well that's me original creation she ain't no original creator she's my product she was in Adam and brother branham right there from souls and prisoners said she was a byproduct in Adam a rib so that doesn't mean he made something different or something wrong how could God make a woman wrong and in judge her for being wrong oh you can pick up all the little things running through brother runs medicine you just run your ideas through anymore you can just have a great thing in your mind how the woman sees this and how the woman she's there and how this and that or the other but you're gonna come back to one thing what did God take out of Adam he said real What did he say he took out of Adam the feminist park right he left out on the masculine park right so he took the theme in this part out and he put that theme in his park into that woman that was standing on earth now what is are you talking about brother Dale will diminish I've got him laying on a - I just decided to forget it you ain't gonna listen to it you want anyway a woman has a nature that is the feminist Park why would your prophet take it and then show you over and over you know what York and he said that little girl he said that little girl said she gets big enough to walk and play you look at these back here Lily and Sophie young or anslee back in the corner they have dolls right why well mom and daddy you know sure does that's where you you can form him nature's yeah I know I'm different than the rest of most people I know that I don't believe in homosexuality's and things like that as being some kind of a germ you got I believe it's a hereditary trait passed down by somebody you can take that all you want to would you take that little boy and you make him play with dolls you're changing his nature you take that little girl and make her play with cars and toys out in the yard you're changing that child's nature that's the way things get started you say well now my little girl wants to play what I don't mean go over click that goddamn boy brother Dan steady ain't posted that never put the dog down or there now you gonna be you're making me say something I'm playing but there's a nature to that little girl to be a mother nature the little boy to be a daddy now you tell me the difference in it anything you tell me I'm gonna say that's the nature to be a woman you know coming here or you tell ya once that's the nature to be man so let's just solve that problem huh let's get it straight Satan knew that there was no need of trying to contact Adam because he couldn't get to him not now listen not that Adam was so 45 behind the words you could not get to it cause he finally did forget it I don't argue with ya he finally got to him called Adam done the wrong but see he knew that mother nature in that little girl called Eve come on explain it some other way to me I've been I'm too old I'm too far down the road I'm tired of byproducts and the way preachers do their churches and the things like I told the preacher one time years ago he say priests spiritual husband somebody was gonna remember it tells us dark and they preached spiritual husband so strong until what they had was that the women couldn't go or the church couldn't go listen nobody else preach there's personal husband they were their husband I said that might be alright but I don't want my husband running around on me so you quit going listen you preachers quit going out there preaching in their mother women they didn't like me and they still don't like me and you know what I love them what was it that was put in Eve now come on I know you can go through and you're gonna go home you're gonna pick it up and you're gonna put in a tape your dart is you don't say beauty right you're gonna say beauty's to Satan took the beauty God made her pretty Satan didn't make a beautiful Satan took her beauty that God had already given her you want me to give you a quote we're brother Branham says that even the blushing part of Eve was controlled by the eternal life that was put down I just read down because beauty is is we call it skin deep right you know ugliness goes all the way to the bone right you can be beautiful it's all beauty and this mean is a rattlesnake what's it what did God build and Eve he made a woman he made a woman that would desire come on brothers that would desire to be a mother come on the only desire you better put in Eve is not a lustful this that or the other a desire to be a mother Satan knew that was his only in road to the human race was to touch her in the basis of her being the desire to be a mother now come on we'll get to what happened next all right the Lord willing wins me will cover the fall okay see you're making the woman of some kind of a horrible situation you're making something that God made to do he made her with a desire to be a mother now come on see I'm not through the message because remember in theophany they were told to what they were told to multiply and replenish the earth so Eve already knew the story she just didn't know how to play it out she knew that something was to happen because she was a part of Adam and that they were to multiply that desire and that mother to be a mother and there was nothing more beautiful the old man you get it he'd gone deer hunting he's gone golfing he's gone goofing and whatever you do you know the story you know what the woman who used it as a right side the brain a man uses the left side so she's in the right mind okay Oh got a cloud from the wife okay is that true but I didn't write the rest of the story I hope she clocks behind it I didn't write it that a woman's a thousand times easier to be deceived but now listen let's make that straight while we're at it that's not talking about your mentality of your brain they are women that are superior intelligent photographic memories and intelligence beyond the mankind but all you got to do is brag on her a little bit and she just smells come on I'm old but I'm still human I remember you come in and you brag on that woman a little bit man she'll cook you anything in the world but you come in and you a little bit hey well she said go get your own she's a thousand times more easy to be deceived about being a woman not about the world in the situation there are smart women come on Oh who was the lady it used to because I remember they questioned me about that one too who was the lady that used to be the head of Israel go to me a woman the head of Israel the nation that was not supposed to have a woman anywhere but she was the head of Israel this world would be in bad shape it wouldn't for the smart women that's in it but you know what it takes to being smart don't let me say this we're going on you know being smart if not how much sense you got it's not being smart isn't know how to use read colleague or the way I want that's Lauren thanks everybody Connie that's why I've always said I ain't never worried about money all I got to do is just get this over here this is my buddy we've been together a long time I said brother Kali give me a bell fall he wouldn't question me know why he'd hand it out because he knows I wouldn't throw it away and wouldn't do wrong with it he'd just hand it to me you see Church what I'm trying to describe as a nature a woman has a motherly nature about her Satan went right straight to that point and when he did he got in to get one race through the beast by telling her they don't tell you what's that she can be to see the Adam and Eve I'm quoting word around them they don't tell you he tell you what to plan yeah let's team oh we got Reza to think on these things [Music] and that feels my true [Music] about having a baby [Music] and touch me [Music] the same [Music] we're committed into your hands when you do take care of me everything be alright we don't ask for the winner if for whatever we just asked for everything will be alright we love you we thank anybody else [Music] and you dismiss me and made me [Music] since he came and me home you
