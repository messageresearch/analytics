[1:02] um one out you have one out of your best
[1:04] you get to all right here we go he
[1:14] bridge with in Hebrews let's go to
[1:17] Hebrews chapter 6 verse one we ended up
[1:21] with verse five
[1:22] I mean chapter five leads oh here we are
[1:25] winds chapter 6 and this is the
[1:26] wonderful chapter Paul starts it off now
[1:29] remember as we've been teaching these
[1:34] are letters that Paul is writing to
[1:36] someone all right so he's writing it to
[1:40] the Christians that are there at
[1:43] wherever he's at at the moment writing
[1:46] the letter and it's a complete letter so
[1:49] we go back to five right here and we see
[1:56] this is when we ended up though this is
[1:58] a letter man honey put the man put the
[2:00] chapter
[2:01] this is just a letter scholars put the
[2:04] chapters in when they see that the
[2:06] thought changes but I I wished it would
[2:08] just stay the way it was it's like a
[2:10] letter written straight down all right
[2:12] so this is the leverage straight now
[2:14] because sometimes we probably lose our
[2:16] thought immersed in tact we just start
[2:18] reading in Chapter six we kind of lose
[2:20] what Paul is talking about the go back
[2:22] to the five down at the bottom verse
[2:25] twelve or when for the time ye ought to
[2:27] be teachers you have need that one teach
[2:29] you again which be the first principles
[2:30] of the Oracles of God in other words
[2:32] starting over ABCs going back to
[2:34] kindergarten all right and your
[2:36] Christian experience and I become such
[2:38] as have need of milk and not strong meat
[2:41] looks good but we like strong meat for
[2:44] everyone that uses milk is unskillful in
[2:47] the word of righteousness for his debate
[2:49] right and God doesn't trust his word to
[2:52] babies he trusts them to full-grown
[2:54] people now we all have to start his
[2:56] babies we all begin as babies we all
[2:59] like milk but I love the analogy that I
[3:02] always show people bet you want to go
[3:06] preach somewhere else about the full
[3:08] combat these the lineups man and eagle
[3:10] the lion starts as ferocious as he is
[3:14] and it's much an amazing the lion is the
[3:17] first thing the first manga line does is
[3:20] what drinks milk
[3:22] all right way the hops when the Ox is
[3:25] born the Ox drinks milk and it learns to
[3:27] eat grass and all these other things and
[3:29] then man even man is strong as we are
[3:31] with the teeth we have four canines them
[3:33] to eat meat and all the other thing with
[3:35] we start out with no teeth and drinking
[3:38] milk right don't feed a baby a steak but
[3:41] now when I baby gets about five or six
[3:44] you chunk it up a little bit
[3:45] today but what will happen it will choke
[3:48] that son went that way I see the gospel
[3:51] God has made it so simple that you can
[3:55] look at your everyday life and see your
[3:57] Christian walk all right
[3:58] because you started out as a baby you
[4:00] can't walk somebody has to help you
[4:01] somebody helps you as a young Christian
[4:03] always helped you have the young
[4:04] Christian and you can able all that
[4:07] helps you and the young Christian
[4:09] navigate in your life group and teaching
[4:12] you how to be a better Christian I mean
[4:16] what's your obey I mean if you're born
[4:18] and depending on your your Christian um
[4:20] in Europe your newborn babe in Christ
[4:22] but now we get to the last one which is
[4:25] to Eagle anointing which is line ops man
[4:28] become another Eagle has no milk blames
[4:31] the mother Eagle has zero milk glands
[4:34] there they were not they were not made
[4:37] to be given milk they were made to eat
[4:40] meat but what Mommy Eagle have to do is
[4:42] go kill the thing chew it up regurgitate
[4:45] it and stick it down into the throat of
[4:47] the baby and she knows exactly how much
[4:49] they'll take to not choke them all right
[4:52] that's the same way with the gospel
[4:54] please give us a possible prophets
[4:56] basses teachers and evangelist to come
[4:58] here on the Sun in winds din and every
[5:01] time we match play or whatever you want
[5:02] to say listen to a sermon that is mama
[5:05] eagle chew em to be pieces up and giving
[5:10] them to you as you need them but now
[5:12] then there's got to be a time though
[5:13] that if you're still 30 years old and
[5:17] you're a 30 year old eagle and you're
[5:18] sitting in this going there's a problem
[5:23] that I'm sure I'm sure
[5:26] Darlene would be let's get to have her
[5:28] here today I want to put
[5:29] but we you know sister darlings here and
[5:32] and she's the youngest of the whole
[5:34] bunch so she's very young back with you
[5:36] the oldest child and but you know they
[5:42] may eat today welcome that likes coming
[5:44] before my family's coming to my house
[5:46] and we're gonna eat we're gonna eat
[5:47] turkey and crazy and all these different
[5:49] thing but you know what I'm not gonna
[5:51] get up in the morning and Mama's gonna
[5:52] be still sitting in the house you know
[5:55] at the table going so I need to be me
[5:57] now may have to later only love one of
[6:03] my analogy is is darlings never how old
[6:05] she is young she is she's not going home
[6:08] with sister Hannah every day and Anna
[6:10] wakes up in the morning and she's got
[6:11] her life the little Charlie got her life
[6:14] to live and Darling said at the table in
[6:17] the morning you know you just sometimes
[6:19] you just have to say grow up get your
[6:23] own teeth go get your own go get your
[6:25] own food yeah you get your own teeth
[6:27] because somebody's hurt so you know so
[6:32] that's the way it is in the gospel God
[6:34] doesn't always want you to stay in the
[6:35] eagle's nest he wants you to be Annie
[6:36] gonna be able to fly and do your own
[6:38] thing tell me your own food eat your own
[6:40] meat
[6:41] get your own revelation okay so we can
[6:46] see that to you it's just not it's just
[6:49] not fruitful for you don't have old
[6:52] older children that are still at home
[6:54] but it's just there's just something
[6:55] going on there but strong meat belongeth
[6:57] to them that are a full age are mature
[7:01] even those who by reason of use in other
[7:05] words we had to learn to eat some of us
[7:09] have quit learning how to eat we just
[7:11] eat yeah we don't need for sustenance we
[7:14] go be like but but even by reason of use
[7:17] have their senses exercised in other
[7:20] words what we eat three meals a day or
[7:22] two meals their ever want you to meet
[7:24] eat to sustain you same way in the
[7:26] gospel you know what you need
[7:29] you ought to the Christian know one
[7:31] thing for sure when you're in a dry
[7:33] spell and when you think you know you
[7:36] you're the whole world don't copy just
[7:40] from
[7:40] one thing it's a growing thing it's a
[7:43] growing thing don't don't you know God
[7:45] doesn't want you to cry daddy daddy
[7:47] daddy daddy he wants you to grow up you
[7:49] know figure things out for yourself
[7:50] use the Holy Spirit that's inside of you
[7:52] to live your day in the life and even
[7:54] even also live your life as a Christian
[7:56] to read what's in the Bible do what's in
[7:59] the Bible because that's what totally
[8:01] those did it's the person of Jesus
[8:02] Christ inside of you teaching you what
[8:06] to do but strong meat belong to them
[8:09] there are a full age even those who by
[8:11] reason of use have their senses
[8:13] exercised to discern both good and evil
[8:16] and that is our discernment to discern
[8:18] both good and evil because we are given
[8:20] that sense to know what's good no one's
[8:24] evil especially being a Christian now if
[8:26] you're if you're not a Christian then
[8:28] your world is convoluted your world is
[8:30] is out here where like I said before
[8:32] smoking drinking gambling cussing and
[8:34] all those things and I still go to
[8:36] church I mean actually that may be a
[8:38] baby big girl up you know gonna come to
[8:42] this church and listen to what's going
[8:43] on in this dirt and be a baby very long
[8:45] you're either going to go out are you
[8:47] going to grow up one of the two so
[8:49] that's why I think you know people
[8:51] sometimes have a problem with with a
[8:54] prophet with brother Brandon you know
[8:56] following a profit but we follow Jesus
[8:58] Christ we follow what he says but it's
[9:01] all in the Bible so what we're doing is
[9:03] we're getting an amplified version we're
[9:04] getting them but we're getting the big
[9:06] picture mama eagle because there's a lot
[9:09] of things in the Bible we didn't
[9:10] understand so God had to send a prophet
[9:11] to tell us what God was saying not
[9:15] reinterpret it but tell us these
[9:17] actually what it's been saying because
[9:19] it's hidden from the eyes of the wise
[9:20] included it hidden from the ones that
[9:22] are that are that are not Christian it's
[9:24] not just I hate to say this but dogs are
[9:29] segregation with he's always been
[9:33] segregation was read brother and brother
[9:35] I'll tell you God is the segregation
[9:36] with these segregates he don't you to
[9:38] mingle he did one Israel to mingle with
[9:40] the world the worst thing of Israel
[9:41] one is starting to marry Moe Bock's and
[9:44] ice and hip tops and websites and all
[9:46] the other side and oh my that's now so
[9:51] you understand what I mean so it's all
[9:53] their nights it's what got Israel in
[9:55] trouble but God said stay with your own
[9:56] group alright stay with your own people
[9:58] same way with in the gospel sure we have
[10:02] to be out in the world but we don't have
[10:03] to be able to world we have to be
[10:05] different
[10:05] I don't normal it's not their normal our
[10:07] normal to them at that room then we're
[10:14] not supposed to think the way the world
[10:15] things go tell the mind of Christ that's
[10:17] what we'll get into later on but we have
[10:19] the line of Christ which crosses the one
[10:21] it's going to turn us back to the word
[10:22] but now Paul has to give us faith over
[10:26] here and he said okay down at the bottom
[10:27] but strongly belong to them that are
[10:29] full age even those who by reason of use
[10:31] have their senses exercised to discern
[10:32] both good and evil continue reading this
[10:34] is not a chapter right therefore
[10:38] therefore in other words what I just
[10:40] said all of it is a wonderful orator
[10:45] he's in heat well you know that's where
[10:48] - God's perfect so God was talking to
[10:50] Paul this is the Eternal Word and it
[10:51] will change right so Paul says therefore
[10:54] all that I've said therefore leaving the
[10:57] principles now here's where we get in
[11:00] trouble sometimes
[11:02] but that means elementary discussion of
[11:06] now does not mean that we're supposed to
[11:09] get away from water baptism and all the
[11:12] all the major doctrines in the Bible but
[11:15] we're not supposed to be the 30 year old
[11:18] kids setting setting him up in the
[11:21] parents house waiting on the parents
[11:22] feet all right therefore leaving get out
[11:25] of the house go find your job buy your
[11:29] own food amen
[11:31] therefore therefore leaving the
[11:36] principles of the doctrine of Christ now
[11:38] what do you do Easter babies here okay
[11:40] but don't stay babies yeah everybody's
[11:41] baby when they start we all start same
[11:43] way long
[11:44] right right but now if we grow up and
[11:47] eat strong meat like he said there in
[11:48] verse whatever that was 13 or 14 down to
[11:50] bottom he's staying now therefore
[11:53] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[11:55] of Christ let us go on to perfection or
[12:00] what maturity God won't mature people
[12:10] perfection completion not laying again
[12:15] the foundation of repentance from dead
[12:17] works no what's he saying today if we
[12:20] have been to church today then brother
[12:23] Dale may drop back I may drop back and
[12:25] we may just talk about some things that
[12:28] we usually don't talk about because hey
[12:29] we don't want to show the people we
[12:31] don't want to show them we want we want
[12:33] to say that that we're you know good
[12:35] Christian people then they end up what
[12:37] mama evil it's not gonna choke but we
[12:43] don't talk about water baptism every
[12:45] Church we don't talk about no eternal
[12:48] hell they reserved we don't talk about
[12:50] there not being a Trinity or service but
[12:52] we do interject those things in there
[12:54] for the ones that what listen in every
[12:59] family there's older people middle of
[13:02] aging younger people so when you have a
[13:05] family reunion you don't just get up and
[13:07] you say well I talked to all the adults
[13:08] today well no there's some kids still
[13:11] there there's some things you wouldn't
[13:13] say that you would say if they weren't
[13:14] there or would not say would say if they
[13:16] were there alright so you have to be
[13:19] careful same way with the gospel you're
[13:21] preaching to a group of people upstairs
[13:23] this family members it's all different
[13:26] Asian but what's God want to do though
[13:28] he's wanting to draw us that's why I
[13:30] believe God did sent a prophet he sent a
[13:32] prophet to tell us exactly what the word
[13:35] says and for us to grow up and die and
[13:37] not be babies and not be not being
[13:39] wondering about you know you turn a kid
[13:42] loose in Town Square in New York
[13:44] what a disaster yeah but now you take
[13:48] somebody like John she's 35 years old
[13:50] he's been times where the town
[13:52] I had no reservations with him getting
[13:54] on a plane flying on penguins in Times
[13:55] Square why he's an older with toward all
[13:57] right okay Joanna order go to her
[13:59] Christian will show their self and not
[14:02] cry so much
[14:04] but what why cry Moses speak that's what
[14:08] we're coming we're trying to come into
[14:09] speaking condition I'm not not laying
[14:13] again the foundation of repentance from
[14:15] dead works and of faith toward God
[14:17] now the doctrine of baptism and of
[14:20] laying on of hands more region one today
[14:24] I found about the laying on of hands and
[14:28] it's connected with the number seven
[14:30] we're gonna talk about seven seal today
[14:32] with no problems and over seven but
[14:36] about quote a on the hands and a
[14:38] resurrection of the Dead and of eternal
[14:40] judgment and this we will do will we do
[14:43] it God permit okay we're an impossible
[14:46] it is impossible don't know did you put
[14:53] it see another battery okay we may have
[14:58] to get another that clocks probably go
[15:00] over this jerk here did it right okay
[15:05] before he is impossible for those who
[15:08] were once enlightened and have tasted of
[15:11] the heavenly gift and were made for
[15:13] takers of the Holy Ghost now not
[15:15] possessors
[15:17] get this right you cannot possess the
[15:20] Holy Ghost in your soul being possessed
[15:24] by ghosts I will take it in every time
[15:29] you cannot possess the Holy Ghost in
[15:33] your soul and fall away okay but you can
[15:39] be you can be enlightened you can sit in
[15:41] a messy church look what's happening
[15:43] tonight that scripture just exact
[15:44] what's happening today people taking the
[15:46] messenger for 20 30 years listening to
[15:49] the message and then go right back down
[15:53] in the world you can't do that and have
[15:55] the baptismal all go okay and were made
[15:59] partakers now you can be making the
[16:00] takers you can be you can be impulsive
[16:05] noted ones you can been truly anointed
[16:07] by the Holy Ghost but it's just on your
[16:08] on your spirit round not your soul and
[16:11] I'm tasted the good word of God you go
[16:15] to church you'll get the good word of
[16:17] God and the powers of the world to come
[16:20] if they shall fall away to renew them
[16:24] again unto repentance seeing that
[16:27] crucify to themselves the Son of God
[16:29] afresh and put into an open chain
[16:31] so that's what's happening now because
[16:34] watch what this this this will tell you
[16:36] if they shall fall away to renew them
[16:39] again to repentance now look there's
[16:41] another place where you talk about
[16:42] there's no more sacrifice there's no
[16:44] sacrifice for this there is no there's a
[16:46] sacrifice for ignorance but there is no
[16:49] sacrifice for knowing better and not
[16:52] doing there's no factor class for that
[16:53] you got to go back and you got to repent
[16:55] and you got to be backed out of the name
[16:57] Jesus Christ or and and receive the
[16:59] baptism a wholeness
[17:04] unless you blast me that's the only
[17:06] thing I even might even be an ax
[17:08] murderer or a whoremonger whatever you
[17:10] going to be but if God gets ahold of you
[17:13] and gives you the new birth
[17:14] you're just as clean as a person that
[17:16] there would be anything that's to me
[17:18] that's the saving grace of Jesus Christ
[17:20] but now don't do that and don't find
[17:22] Jesus in jail every once in a while and
[17:24] just you know get go to read in the
[17:26] Bible till you get out of jail you know
[17:28] little man say that's not finding Jesus
[17:30] in jail that's just getting caught all
[17:33] right so you can't crucifying afresh and
[17:38] put him to an open shame because
[17:41] remember true repentance
[17:46] those who these justified he's already
[17:49] got glorified those who he's justified
[17:52] as a journey but now you can be
[17:55] justified and lose it all
[17:57] that's just what the denominational
[18:00] world calls being safe i but we believe
[18:03] in salvation we believe in salvation and
[18:05] the Bible says if you believe on the
[18:07] Lord Jesus Christ now shall be safe but
[18:09] we understand too though that the mean
[18:12] that we get of that is that if you
[18:15] continue on us what I told the guy one
[18:17] time he I told him I got saved he said
[18:19] well that's great I got saved a couple
[18:21] of years ago I said Bob no ball no you
[18:23] bought but Bobby
[18:24] this guy was Bob stump was his name he
[18:27] was the bank president and he said yeah
[18:32] I got saved a couple years ago we have a
[18:34] bug light in his hand cursing like a
[18:38] sailor and I just listen Bubba would you
[18:41] get safe from and he just looked at me
[18:46] with that far off there I said to get
[18:49] saved means you were in the water ground
[18:51] me because we were in a boat fishing
[18:52] actually so I had I had captive audience
[18:54] he couldn't go home they were out of
[18:56] milk way so we were fishing some little
[18:59] retreat we had but when I owned James II
[19:01] we got together with all the banking
[19:03] people come they love you because you
[19:04] borrow their money and you can hide in
[19:05] the bank so it's old stuff without them
[19:09] you know we go fishing when I said tell
[19:11] me I said same means if you following
[19:13] the water and you're grounding somebody
[19:14] picks you up put you back in this boat
[19:17] now the way you're telling it is is yeah
[19:20] you might have got picked up put back
[19:21] the boat we keep his job run back no
[19:23] water either and he just kind of looked
[19:26] drains and started a new conversation
[19:32] and you could have had a work with
[19:36] repentance the Bible says you know ask
[19:39] God and he'll know yeah
[19:41] Trumpy sends off but we don't want to
[19:44] ask you that one I ask him to take that
[19:45] person that may motivated me to do it to
[19:47] begin with if you'll take that person
[19:50] out and fill it with the hope of those
[19:51] you won't go and do the same thing again
[19:53] and they shall fall away to renew them
[19:57] again to repentance seeing they crucify
[19:59] to themselves the Son of God afresh and
[20:02] pleading to note the shame it would be
[20:04] shameful for stump his name with John
[20:08] Stumpf what the father makes me think
[20:10] John's done and he will be shameful for
[20:12] job but John to tell people he got saved
[20:17] and he starts testifying to people and
[20:19] he's standing there with a bug light in
[20:20] his hand you know and talking about all
[20:22] of the things that he does at the bar
[20:25] and you know all that stuff and you're
[20:26] going well that's an open shame what
[20:28] Jesus Christ died for yeah he died to
[20:31] take all that away from us give us some
[20:34] newness of life when we walk in newness
[20:35] of life for the earth was drinketh than
[20:37] the rain that cometh off the pond it and
[20:41] bran for herbs meat for them by human
[20:43] distress he receive a blessing from God
[20:44] all right Nate speaks in the make a
[20:46] point here but that which bad thorns and
[20:49] briers is rejected and 9 - cursing who
[20:51] tended to be burned in other words
[20:53] what's happening people get a blessing
[20:57] from God
[20:58] alright the rain the word the anointing
[21:02] falls on the just and the unjust it
[21:04] falls on the good seat in the back seat
[21:07] remember the Bible in one store that
[21:09] shows a good season and one store that
[21:10] so it's bad thing all right but Jesus
[21:13] says leave them alone the Lord let them
[21:15] grow because you know what if you go out
[21:18] and we plant food plots in them in the
[21:21] fall and we taken week this ground that
[21:24] we do is just like this I mean there
[21:26] nothing growing in it legal out we plant
[21:28] clover only plant arrived we plant wheat
[21:32] and about three weeks later you know you
[21:35] got up but you let that anything there's
[21:42] not a bad seat on the whole place but
[21:45] now about a month from there you see
[21:50] that about 50% of that its thorns
[21:54] thistles Canadian thistle which it's
[21:59] just it came from that it's going back
[22:03] you know what can I get this little
[22:05] Danny
[22:06] Oh it'll LLL beat you mama knows whether
[22:08] they yeah I said it came going back many
[22:11] ways but you can't but I've seen this
[22:13] once you get started you cannot tell so
[22:16] I can't go out there with a hole and
[22:18] start digging up plants that I think
[22:21] look like no you gotta let it mature so
[22:25] God said member they told us to leave
[22:27] alone let on the tour when the
[22:30] harvesters come in to read they don't
[22:31] know what's corn and they'll know what's
[22:33] private all right same thing with the
[22:35] deer the analogy is the deer will pick
[22:37] through and eat all the clover and leave
[22:38] all the other stuff I let them pick it
[22:41] you know but you got away with tours
[22:43] though so he's got to wait to you and I
[22:44] have come to now on time of the end of
[22:48] all things and God is going to see who's
[22:49] more toward who's not okay because you
[22:53] weed you weave looks just like this and
[22:55] you corn looks just like this but now
[22:57] with any growing up than what this is
[22:59] gonna manifest to see this is going to
[23:02] manifest the seed that it's starting
[23:04] with this is going to manifest to see
[23:06] didn't start to clear and it ain't the
[23:07] same seed you know God's the harvester
[23:18] we're not going to call us now see
[23:23] because watch them the analogy with Paul
[23:25] I'm trying to think of which one is
[23:27] where it's there's a Polish water I'm
[23:30] planning to polish watered or something
[23:32] in but God gives me
[23:35] so it's god that's gonna take us out of
[23:37] here now watch them at one a five fold
[23:39] ministry is is where the we're the
[23:42] fertilizer you can take that the wrong
[23:48] way where the fertilizer where the where
[23:53] the Master Gardener right we lay these
[23:57] things out we fertilize the ground we
[24:00] water it with the washing of the part of
[24:02] the work that's our job but my God's
[24:04] gonna get the increase God's not come to
[24:06] me and I'm trying to think of that as
[24:08] I'm talking I'm trying to think of that
[24:10] scripture where it says that the Reapers
[24:12] will come in and reap the harvest right
[24:14] and then what someone will be bound and
[24:17] burnt some will be bound and taken up
[24:19] all right so that's that's going to do
[24:20] that not us but all we're doing here is
[24:23] to fertilize and water and what be a
[24:26] Master Gardener I like being a Master
[24:29] Gardener being a Master Gardener you see
[24:31] some really beautiful things come up so
[24:35] no Papa ministry would be your
[24:37] caretakers definitely put it that one if
[24:40] i whole ministry would be your
[24:40] caretakers God will be the one that will
[24:43] get the increase you'll be the one that
[24:45] will pick us out of here now meet the
[24:47] disciple make sure that he comes and
[24:49] does that but we're not the soul don't
[24:53] make us so much good we're not all that
[24:55] good for the earth they drink them in
[24:57] the rain that comes off the pond it and
[24:58] bring forth earth meat for them by
[25:01] moving this dress received blessings
[25:02] from God but that was best Norman price
[25:04] is rejected and not unto cursing whose
[25:07] hand is to be burned but beloved we are
[25:10] persuaded by the things of you what he's
[25:13] come by those that are of the right seat
[25:15] those that are of the right plan this
[25:18] one not this one and things that
[25:22] accompany salvation now here you go
[25:25] right back to what he goes right back to
[25:27] maturity its accompanying style but
[25:30] accompany salvation what happens is it's
[25:33] like like I said you know you you get
[25:35] the baby here and and there
[25:37] babies are wonderful because we know
[25:39] their babies and we don't expect them to
[25:40] do anything but my baby's day all right
[25:43] but like I said as they grow up and
[25:46] they're still in diapers in their 20s
[25:47] and 30s and they're still eating late
[25:50] babbling that's what I'm that's a long
[25:51] time ago more mangoes what that no well
[25:53] tell me old one but you know mama still
[25:57] don't need today we're gonna have green
[25:59] beans he's not going to go over there
[26:00] mash the green beans up so that we can
[26:02] deal well because we've matured what
[26:05] we've come to salvation we become a son
[26:08] and daughter of done now God doesn't say
[26:10] beautiful baby and go over here say in
[26:12] the corner and he just goes beautiful
[26:13] babies then your platter beautiful baby
[26:15] another baby will die all right and so
[26:18] what does the company salvation the
[26:20] growth development the one for you and I
[26:23] some but though we do speak a company we
[26:26] are talking about the things that
[26:28] accompany salvation today that's what I
[26:30] think that that I believe that everybody
[26:34] calls to message the only different
[26:36] thing the message to me is that it's
[26:38] that part that accompany salvation it's
[26:41] not just divers know supposed to live
[26:43] the Christian life he wants be God made
[26:45] manifest on earth in a human form right
[26:49] forgot it's not unrighteous to forget
[26:52] your work and labor of love
[26:55] excuse me which you have showed toward
[26:57] his name in the GM minister to the
[26:59] Saints and do minister and we designer
[27:03] that every one of you do show the same
[27:05] diligence to the full assurance of open
[27:07] to the hand in other words not just
[27:08] preachers everybody they'ii be not
[27:12] slothful or slow work or dilatory but
[27:16] followers of them who through faith and
[27:19] patience inherit the promises you see
[27:21] that said now there's one promise which
[27:23] is the Holy Ghost but there are promises
[27:26] given in the Bible yeah there's nine
[27:28] spiritual
[27:28] there's all these different things that
[27:30] come about that we as we as believers
[27:36] not just Mexican believe believers we
[27:39] believe what God's done because what do
[27:42] they look
[27:43] hey bruh Ham God made a promise to
[27:44] Abraham pay for him brother turn your
[27:51] Abraham you said in your house you're
[27:55] not thinking you're making idols right
[27:58] they've heard April sorry Avram was
[28:00] making idols with his daddy was working
[28:02] in one thing about God at all and all of
[28:04] a sudden this voice now it's not in a
[28:06] book it's not in a video it's not only
[28:10] DVD this voices Abram get up and leave
[28:15] where you're at now that's the exactly
[28:18] what happened to Abel me hey everyone
[28:20] heard oh boy stick stick get up and
[28:22] leave and if you're reading Genesis 1415
[28:25] in there God starts telling him I will
[28:28] do this I will do that I will give you
[28:31] this I will give you this I will give
[28:33] you that and then Abram all right
[28:35] brother turn just gets up walks out the
[28:37] door leaves everything by that now see
[28:41] that's unbelievable
[28:42] honestly it's unbelievable and our
[28:46] humanity is unbelievable because I'm
[28:48] sure saying is probably talking to Abram
[28:51] at the same time no Abram you don't
[28:53] think you can stay right here you make
[28:54] any big living you're doing really good
[28:57] your daddy loves you because you help me
[28:58] with the work you did getting over you
[29:00] need to work there you see the
[29:01] circumstances but that's why Abraham or
[29:04] Abram starting as Abram the baby to come
[29:07] to Abraham the mature man is because God
[29:10] loved Abraham because he knew Abraham
[29:12] would do exactly what he said he's going
[29:15] to do so this so this voice speaks to
[29:18] Abraham reason Omega in this point is he
[29:22] died speaks to us we've done media we've
[29:26] got phone we've got
[29:27] self-service we've got all this internet
[29:30] and Wi-Fi got had Wi-Fi long before man
[29:33] did he talk to us without a liar didn't
[29:37] but he was talking he's talking to us
[29:39] and he gives us all these all these
[29:41] tools and then we say oh that must not
[29:45] be done or we're slothful we shouldn't
[29:50] be slothful we should be more now more
[29:52] aware of God speaking to us and you know
[29:56] what brother Branham told us said now if
[29:58] you give you the way to tell where this
[30:00] daughter not is to go right back and put
[30:02] it in order so say we'll put it in the
[30:05] work he might put a little bit of it but
[30:07] he won't put all of it in the work all
[30:09] right so buddy
[30:10] you see if you if you get a thought how
[30:13] many we got a thought and never ever
[30:14] again entertained it my million oh right
[30:18] but like I told you many times in my
[30:21] Christian journey is there's only been a
[30:25] few times that I know God has spoke
[30:27] directly to me not inaudible boys just
[30:29] inside my head told me things we're
[30:32] gonna happen maybe two three times in my
[30:33] whole Christian experience but still I
[30:35] know that voice I know that tunnel I
[30:38] know when he said but you know why I
[30:40] know it's good it always comes back
[30:43] always films the back I mean you tell me
[30:46] oh if we get dr.aman we go well oh
[30:48] that's the war that's going to come and
[30:49] it doesn't come back I promise you one
[30:51] quart right I promise you you can just
[30:54] remember one thing that was not God if
[30:56] it didn't come to pass that's what I say
[30:58] them you know we we are God that we say
[31:00] he never changes his mind but we all got
[31:04] to change this mind a lot of work does
[31:06] I'm going around here in this dress and
[31:08] Doc told me to well you get there you go
[31:10] I'm not like I'll go this one oh well
[31:12] that ain't where God sent you
[31:13] to that room right very one God may
[31:16] promise to Abraham because he could
[31:19] swear by no greater he swore by himself
[31:21] saying surely blessings i Westing a
[31:24] multiplying I will multiply they and so
[31:27] after he had patiently endure he
[31:31] attained the promise now how patient is
[31:33] that God came to Abram that's 75 years
[31:39] old and said you're gonna have a baby
[31:42] he waited 25 years
[31:46] we can't wait 25 minutes hello
[31:54] we can't wait 25 minutes he patiently
[31:58] endured and what happened you don't
[32:01] blame you that was gone he had the baby
[32:03] but remember there was a big long
[32:06] journey in there Genesis 14 15 16 17
[32:09] they're right in there they they God had
[32:12] to finally meet him face to face and say
[32:14] you're gonna have a baby with Sarah
[32:16] alright so sometimes I don't give you
[32:18] all the direction but he sends somebody
[32:20] to give you the direction nobody favor
[32:23] wonder well Abraham would have walked
[32:24] outside and saw the three men coming and
[32:26] thought they would go home Wiz isn't
[32:28] just over you know what's that one thing
[32:30] scepter Oh
[32:37] I will fall back into one I said but no
[32:46] I really want blood look at the attitude
[32:49] that's what is what palms tell us about
[32:51] now about the attitude he made a promise
[32:54] to Abraham so you a nice Christians when
[32:56] he burst you into the body he gives you
[32:58] a promise he said you are my child and
[33:00] I'm going to take care of you but you
[33:03] got to do what it says in there you got
[33:05] the blueprint you got you got my DNA
[33:07] right here so I want you start looking
[33:09] like because you know part of me so he
[33:11] told Abraham and he patiently endured he
[33:14] obtained the promise that's why we've
[33:15] been in this thing for you know 50 years
[33:17] some more than everybody know more than
[33:21] that but I like that scripture brother
[33:24] Claude always quote those who endure to
[33:25] the end shall be saved those who endure
[33:27] to the end shall we say why because in
[33:30] the end you're gonna get your maturity
[33:32] you going to see your Canadian this one
[33:33] within build purple satanic nasty gross
[33:39] looking
[33:40] but armies really like it and I hate
[33:42] that because they pollinate them and
[33:43] they grow everywhere but but you see
[33:46] that thing you go oh that's just the
[33:49] devil sticking up yes but you know what
[33:52] you got a way to lap the tours then
[33:54] that's got to be chopped away and thrown
[33:57] in the fire but you've got some really
[33:59] good clover down at the bottom there
[34:01] that has been look for awesome so same
[34:03] way with you and on gods wait listen God
[34:06] we're not waiting on God gotta wait on
[34:08] us
[34:09] to come to authority don't work we're
[34:11] not a bunch of babies well we don't cry
[34:13] daddy daddy every time we need something
[34:15] we can speak and let it happen
[34:16] right so after he had patiently endured
[34:20] he obtained the promise what do you have
[34:22] he had the child that he was promised to
[34:23] have four men barely swear by the
[34:27] greater and an oath for confirmation
[34:30] is to them an end of all struggling or
[34:34] strife or dispute right wearing God
[34:39] willing more abundantly in other words
[34:42] than you and me to show unto the heirs
[34:45] of promise that
[34:46] the immutability of his counsel now once
[34:49] he told me he's going back to Abraham
[34:50] Abraham I told you what's going to
[34:54] happen then you gotta wait on it go say
[34:57] that word means unchangeableness okay so
[35:02] in other words
[35:03] immutability is infallibility he is in
[35:06] power God is infallible when he speaks
[35:08] something is immutable that cannot
[35:10] change will not change and the
[35:13] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[35:15] by an oath confirmed if I know what he
[35:20] said Abraham you're gonna have a child
[35:24] and he's gonna be my promised son I
[35:26] promise son now we know that that is a
[35:29] tight because excuse me I think was not
[35:34] Christ he's talking about the US and
[35:36] some about Christ coming the promised
[35:39] child all right but he has to give you
[35:42] an allegory of of what happened in the
[35:44] Old Testament that by two immutable
[35:46] things in which it was impossible for
[35:51] God to lie so I can't lie if you and I
[35:56] remember I was preaching a couple
[35:57] Sundays go on were just right out of my
[36:04] head
[36:04] going back to I'm nipa tense when - I'm
[36:08] impotence me now I'm never getting all
[36:11] powerful with God God's mad man that has
[36:15] done anything that makes two immutable
[36:17] right are two omnipotence so about two
[36:23] immutable things so in other words it
[36:25] got a contract I have two so Abraham or
[36:28] Abram Abraham had to believe God and it
[36:31] was imputed unto him for righteousness
[36:33] so there was an immutable thing here
[36:35] where he believed what God said then you
[36:37] got gone here you can online then we
[36:40] have a strong consolation with a cliff
[36:42] for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
[36:44] before us look we totally have a
[36:47] the soul both sure and steadfast which
[36:51] endureth in that within the veil now
[36:53] remember that's your lair you have an
[37:01] outer core you have an inner court in
[37:02] the Holy of Holies and there's only one
[37:04] man who can enter it behind that veil
[37:06] and that's God itself all right whenever
[37:09] the forerunner is for us enter even
[37:11] Jesus
[37:12] whither the forerunner is for us entered
[37:14] entered even Jesus maiden high priest
[37:16] forever after the order of melchizedek
[37:18] in other words he went in and remember
[37:20] when Christ died the veil was rent all
[37:25] right and we're going to really stop run
[37:27] down because we're going to get into
[37:28] Melchizedek next Sunday but we'll read
[37:30] just a few it's just about 20 African we
[37:33] don't have this per second for this
[37:35] Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the
[37:37] Most High God who met Abraham returning
[37:39] from the slaughter of the Kings and
[37:41] blessed in food during them also later
[37:43] he'll give a tenth part of all first
[37:45] being by interpretation King
[37:46] approximants after that king of Salem
[37:47] which is King the peace without father
[37:51] without mother now a lot of people
[37:52] believe that that was an actual priest
[37:54] person or somebody and I said without
[37:57] closet without mother now who in the
[37:59] world is without father without mother
[38:00] there's not a soul on this earth don't
[38:03] have a father no mother except one man
[38:04] 19 is Christ all right or God Almighty
[38:07] without father without mother without
[38:09] descent those who didn't have any
[38:12] brothers or sisters naturally having
[38:15] neither beginning of days nor ending a
[38:18] life I don't see how that's pretty plain
[38:19] who that is okay but made like them to
[38:23] the Son of God abideth the priest
[38:25] now the Timmy now see now consider how
[38:28] great this man was it was a man
[38:30] and we'll talk about that next Sunday
[38:32] we're gonna talk about male care that
[38:33] they coming down a meeting
[38:35] Abram will actually go back to Genesis
[38:38] really get into this next time you swim
[38:40] god bless you happy Mother's Day to all
[38:42] mothers and take around a you to give
[38:48] something
[38:48] [Music]
