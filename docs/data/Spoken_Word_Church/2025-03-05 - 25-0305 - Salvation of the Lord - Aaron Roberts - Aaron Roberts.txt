let's stand look into the scripture this evening and uh we're going to try something new tonight I'm actually I'm actually controlling this up here brother Anderson is trying to drag me into the 21st century trying get me to use technology so but praise the Lord so I'm going to try this up here and I thank the Lord for all of our technical brothers that amen yes sir that take care of all this amen you give them a hand there's a lot of stuff that goes on behind the scenes and we don't have to deal with amen we just reap the benefits of it and I told Richard there's one place that I don't want to go that I'm glad I don't have to go and I probably wouldn't fit but I wouldn't want to climb in this attic I I don't think I'll fit and if I'm afraid if I get in there I may not get out yeah I was going to start kicking the cheet rock out start climbing out work my way out of there but I've seen Richard try to climb up in there and that's like I T my hat to that and some of these other brothers brother Josh different ones has climbed in there that's a that's a job but before we uh read the scripture tonight let's just all bow our heads we'll speak to the author and invite him in as we get ready to read the word Heavenly Father we thank you for this time Lord that we're able to gather again in your house Lord thank you for all your blessings on us Lord Jesus we just thank you Lord that we're able to gather Lord you said we're two or three are gathered in my name I'll be there in the midst and Lord Jesus we know that you're here with us because you honor your word and we just pray that you just have your will and way with us tonight bless the words that goes forth Lord Jesus and Lord just give me the words to say and Lord just anoint our hearts and our minds and our ears to receive from from you and just hear what you'd have to say to us and Lord for those that are be listening in Lord now and later Lord we just pray that you be with them and touch them Lord bless them the ones that are sick and Afflicted Lord Jesus you know each need Lord we just continue to hold them up and believe that you'll do a mighty work Lord because you are the great physician and Lord we just commit ourselves to you and just believe that you will do it and you said that if we would ask then we would receive and we just put our trust and our confidence in your word Lord we've seen what you've done so far and Lord we know that you'll continue to do it we thank you for it in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen 2 Samuel 22 1 through3 and and it says and David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies out of the hand of Saul and he said the Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my deliverer the god of my rock in him will I trust he is my shield and the Horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge My Savior thou savest me from violence amen you may be seated and got a couple other scriptures here Psalms 3 and8 says salvation belongeth unto the Lord thy blessing is upon thy people seaw and Jonah 2:9 says I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that which I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and that's the reason I entitled this tonight salvation of the Lord and that's one of the reason why I wanted to sing that song tonight Love Lifted Me because when you realize what salvation is as we were speaking when Sunday you know when you look at what salvation is when you see the condition that you were in to see where you what salvation is and what what it brings you to you know when you when you see uh what salvation really means because many people you know they they don't seem to understand what what it means to be saved you know they like to say well I'm saved but you know you know you know they don't really seem to understand what it means to be saved and I love that song I was thinking about that song you know when when I was Sinking Deep in sin far from the peaceful Shore I mean that paints a very Vivid picture to understand where you are at and he come looking for you when you're when there was nothing else I was I was so lost and undone there was no place for me to go I couldn't save myself there was nothing I could do when you realize the condition that you're in that you realize that you have to come to that place that you have to realize I I can't do anything for myself you know as we was talking about the brother R talking about the man being in the river you know when you realize that you know the man was in the river well you know you got to get him out right he said you know you got to get the man out of the river then you got to get the river out of the man and so you you realize the condition and here in the in the message court trial brother says like we claim to be saved they say well show me how you're saved my life proves I'm saved the way I act proves whether I'm saved or not no matter how much I testify about it here you'll know how I live whether I'm saved or not and he said same way with healing if you accept if you accept it you believe see you accept God of his word he says now that word that comes from the Greek word Soo meaning saved just like the materially saved or spiritually saved you're saved Soo he saved her from a premature grave because brother R was talking about the lady with the issue of blood and he came just the same as he saved you from hail Soo the same Greek word is used notice thy faith has Soo saved thee from the sickness that you had notice same word every time and then continue on so here's here's the definition of of Soo means to to save to rescue deliver healed to make make whole to protect keep alive preserve life or to be made whole to rescue deliver from harm from danger or harm to preserve or Guard from injury destruction or loss so when you look to see what it means to be saved you have to see that what you were in a position as we were saying Sunday you you got to realize you were in a position where you were in danger there was this danger and you don't you realize hey I'm lost and just like we about being you know it it's not like being saved where you're talking about you know I had a debt we owed a debt and it's not like owing a bill that you know somebody pays that bill for you the the outcome of this was life and death and so there is there is no other way that you know because when you came you had to as brother brandham was talking about the the young man and he had killed the King's son and when when he had come see when the when the king had come to the man and was asking why did you kill my son and he's like well you know it was an accident I didn't mean to do it but you know he he killed but you know it was a life or death situation you know he was he when when he when the king walked out of that jail cell he thought his life was over with he did not realize but see the the King when he walked out of that jail that jail cell that day when he talked and he saw and had pity and and Grace upon mercy upon that young man he said destroy all the record he said destroy all the records he said there was no record of what took place he said you you you killed my son but he said you'll be my son he said you're going to take that place and he said you know he went in and had him cleaned up and had a put a robe on him and all that and brought him out and he rode with him and the and the vehicle you know and the and the Chariot or whatever it was but you know he he brought him to that place see that's the way it is with salvation you come from a place that you you didn't have we didn't have anything we didn't have you know as as they say we we there was not another way out there there's there's no other options this is it and so when you come to this place and realize I you didn't have another way there's only there's only one way out one way in and and that's through Jesus Christ and you know brother BR was speaking here in in the in the breach when he was talking about Abraham Adam and Eve and you know he said you know they lost their uh claims on eternal life you know here they are in the in the in this great um Eden everything the great condition that they're in everything's perfect there's there's no problems everything's beautiful everything's wonderful but yet brother Bram said because they wanted to try to get wisdom and it said because of of their desire for wisdom it brought death and so here they are they're looking and he said it's the same way with you and I because here they are had everything just the perfect just just exactly the way that it should have been and everything was perfect but God had given them one one stipulation in all of this and he said don't eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil he said everything else you can partake of but you can't partake of that but that's the first thing that that because of of man's nature that was the first thing that that Satan brought to Eve was listen you need to look at this consider this look look what God is doing look look at this plan and and you know and God wants you you know he's trying to keep this from you or whatever it was you know and it's like but she had this knowledge because she was curious about wanting to know what was going on and trying to and it's like but the word said to leave it alone to stay away from it amen and the best and the best policy the best plan was to stay away from it amen when when when God told him to stay away and you know he didn't come he didn't try to bring this to Adam he brought it to Eve that's right and he began to began to speak to her about this and here she is she began to listen to S his sermon he began to listen to what she what he had to say when she should have just said God said we're not supposed to partake of that not even touch it not even have anything to do with it leave it alone but because because of them being brother said because they were on free moral agency see here they are they went to that and they took on that sin because first off you know she had to she had to agree to that before there was ever an act could take place she had to she already had that in her mind that this this was okay everything she she'd overcome all of the obstacles that she had in her mind to over to do that and then all of a sudden then the ACT took place but she had already agreed to that she had already seen that and said oh this is going to be a great wonderful thing not realizing brought death and brother R said see then when you realize see we were born under that sin curse because through Adam because he took Eve and they both sinned and when when all of creation fell then we were born under that sin curse but brother brandom said you know you can't you can't apologize for Adam's sin you can't repent for Adam's sin you can't repent for Eve sin because that's already settled but the only sin that you've got to deal with is your own sin you've got you've got to repent of your own sin see he said that wasn't your fault but he said our our sin is our fault amen our what the sin that we have upon us is our fault and we have we have to answer for that see you have to go to the place and realize you know that you have to brother Bram said here it is in the breach he says see they wanted to find out what it was to have wisdom so they probed into it and it caused death amen and so you have to realize you know you you've got to come to the place that when you see these things that you have to realize it's it's your fault not anybody else's you know one of the places where brother Brandon was talking about that he said brother said that God knows if you're if you're really repentant or not he know H you know you can't you can say well I I you know I I repent and all God knows God knows your heart long before you say anything you know you you don't have you know you're not you can fool a lot of people but you're not going to fool God you're not going to fool him but see when when all of these things came about when the when the when the fall came and we were were born under this sin curse but yet God had a plan for us to come into Fellowship again he made a way for us and here's here's this the plan that you know he always from the beginning he said that he was going to have that enmity between her seat and and the Serpent's seat he'd always but he was going to make a way that bring us back in to fellowship and had everything laid out the the whole plan came into being just perfect all the way down through through time all the prophets began to speak you know and you know all the things you know he had a he had a a sacrifice laid out all the way from the beginning and you know you know because they were they were those like like Seth and and the different ones you know they had a desire for God and those that didn't but you know everybody was on free moral agency everybody was a free moral agent and you know every person had to make their own decision and you see everybody everybody had to choose and you know God's not a respector of persons because he let you make that decision he let them make that decision and you know you know he just laid it out there but you know what there was always a penalty for what they chose to do everybody had to pay the same penalty right but see when you when you see how all these things came about and we know that when Jesus died and he came and he and he took on the this form of sinful flesh and you know he came to take our place to go through the same things that we've went through all the things that we've had to go through in our lives that we can we can take that you know he became what we were to take on sin who knew no sin but he took that on that we could be the very righteousness of God that we could be the righteousness of God that we could be what he is why because that was always the plan of God that's what God always saw of you and it's wonderful to think about when you when you see because you look in the mirror sometimes or maybe all don't I do I look in the mirror sometimes and I and and I think man you know I can just see all my thoughts and failures and all of my problems and all these kind of things and you know and then but sometimes you know the Lord has to come by and or he does me I'm I'm give my testimony today but you know sometimes it's like he smacks you in the face you know you know because you know if we can always live in in a in a in a state of just Gloom and and and sadness and you know and we can sit and you know I mean as as the song you know uh Gloom Despair and Agony on me I mean we we could we could live in that we can live in this world because you know what if if you open the door all you got to do is crack the door and the Devil Comes busting through and and he'll stand on he'll sit on your shoulder and talk in your ear as long as you want him to be there as long as you're welcoming him he'll tell you and you know what that you ain't got a friend in the world there ain't nothing there ain't nothing going right you you just got you got problems morning noon and night and you know it's like why in the world would you even get up out of bed and then and then as as you go through all but you know what it comes all of a sudden there's something that rises up in there and the Lord begins to speak to you and say listen you know what when you realize there's how many billions of people that are in this world out there and you know what he crossed my path to bring me into fellow ship with him I you know there there's nothing good in me there there there's nothing but you know what God's grace came to me and you know what I I was I was a recipient of that there's there's there's nothing because you know because it's not because of my intelligence or my good looks or anything else that that that I could bring that you know that I could say hey this is the reason God chose me because I'm so wonderful there's nothing good about me but praise God because of his mercy and Grace he saw something that you know that that I would receive the gift of eternal life that he give us he did he he he he died so that all might receive but not all will receive and we and we'll see here in in a little bit we'll try to get to it because I don't know how far we'll go but you know you know you see what brother BR talked about you know when when you become he he wants to be your Savior and Lord am but you know people only want to be they only want him to be their savior but they come to that place that you know they don't want to go any further than that and see when you when you come to this place to realize who you are and and what God's done for you and you know when when Jesus died and rose again and told them and told the disciples you know that that to T in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high and begin to tell them that the spirit would come that he that I'm going to go away but the spirit that dwells in me will dwell on dwell in you and it'll be the exact same thing and he said you know what' he say the works that I do shall you do also he said and here he is he said my the father and I will take up our abod in you and here he is then you know that that you will know that I'm in the Father the father in me and I in you when you wake up in the morning the devil's like well you know what I wouldn't get out of bed well you know what I ain't listening to you today you know because you know there you know because it's like well devil you know I'm not listening to you today I a because you know what there ain't there ain't no truth ever been found in you but you know we can we can sit and listen to that but you know what there's not the the truth is not in it and you know the devil's lying to you when he's talking to you but see when when when the Holy Spirit came that day when when the disciples were there and they were in the upper room waiting teing for the the Fulfillment of the scripture that the that the Holy Spirit would come and take up and dwell inside of them them when when that when the spirit came and it came inside of them and they began to speak speak in other tongues you know when when the Holy Spirit came and they come out of that room as drunk men you know here here they are the the scared group of people standing there and all of a sudden here they come out of that room Fearless here they are coming out walking and they didn't care what people thought of them why because they they were in the in the in living in something that had that was that had never happened before here's something somebody had the indwelling of the holy spirit inside of them and they begin to walk out and Proclaim what the word said for their day and when they when they walked out there and you know and here they are standing there and everybody was like you know these these people must be drunk and you know here they are full of new wine but you know the scripture says but Peter standing there telling them he said this is this is not that but but he began to speak to them and he began to speak to them and tell them he said verse 14 I'm I'm I'm trying to skip some of this because I don't want to step up here all night trying to read to y'all but I got I got multiple quotes but I'm just trying to instead of stand up here reading but I W read this but he said Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto him ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose sing it is but the third hour the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet jel and it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and upon my servants and upon my hen men will I pour out my SP in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and it continues on and and so we're just dropping down to verse 21 it says and it shall come to pass that who whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved you men of Israel hear these words Jesus Christ of Nazareth a man approved to God among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as you yourselves also know so here when when they began to speak of this and the first thing that Peter's doing when in in the in the 11 when they begin to speak of this then they turn around and the first thing that he does is say this is the Fulfillment of the scripture of the Prophet Joel and then he turns around and tells him he said but though who that calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved and as soon as he says it the next verse Peter begins to point them right back to Jesus and says Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you have crucified is the Fulfillment and he begins to lay out all the things that the that David had said in the Psalms and begins to preach that whole message and show them who Jesus Christ was because here it is the the message so what is what is the the uh message what is it because it takes the word but what is it when the Holy Spirit comes and it begins to manifest what does he do he manifests the word so he brings the word into manifestation to the people and he begins to preach the word to the people that's right so that is what what was the Holy Spirit Come to do it's it's not to birth us into the kingdom but it's also to bring the word and so when he when he begins to after he as as he begins to preach this message and he says see here it is in verse 36 here here's the the disciples preaching this message and it says therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that same God that made that made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ and he said when they heard this now they were picked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren while what shall we do then Peter said unto them reent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and with many other words he did testify and exhort saying save yourself from this UNT generation so when he began to speak said who whoever will call on the name of the Lord shall be saved and when he when he preaches that see when he brings that out and they ask him said what shall we do to be saved like I said Sunday he didn't just say believe on the Lord just just just well you know I make a decision it wasn't making a decision the first thing that he done was what do you do to be saved he said to repent and what do it mean to repent it means to change your ways change your action the direction that you're going amen yeah here you are changing he said see repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of of your sins he said for the promises unto you and your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call so here here is here is the whole Plan of Salvation when you and you see how it came that when you have to what does it mean to to have to be saved what do you have to do to be saved what do you have to do you have to repent yes first you got to realize that that you're lost that you need a savior that you're not in the right condition you're not right in the right position you're not in right Fellowship when you come to that place then you realize what do you have to do well the first thing you got to do is realize there's a savior there there is a plan and he's reaching out to you and all you got to do is accept and the first thing he says to do is repent and you got to real and then all you do is repent and accept that amen now Sunday I was I asked everybody about uh what if they if they knew what lordship salvation was and so I just want to I just want to bring this out a little bit he said lordship salvation has anybody ever heard of that well I was and the and the reason I'm I'm I'm going to get into the scripture here in a minute but uh what I was listen I was listening to somebody and uh all of a sudden when I heard when I heard him began to this man and he was talking about this topic and I'd never heard it so I was like hey I'm gonna listen to this it sounded pretty neat so I started listening to it and he began to quote scripture and when he started to quote scripture there something that caught my attention and that's what that's what made me think of this but it says lordship salvation points to Jesus Jesus repeated warnings to the religious Hypocrites of his day as proof that simply agreeing to spiritual facts does not save a person there must be a heart change Jesus emphasized the high cost of discipleship for John Luke 14 says whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple amen so when you're when you're looking at what it means to be when when they talk about what what it means in in lordship Salvation is the is the term and well because really it's just salvation but it's the new term that people use uh you know because you know people want a savior but they don't want a lord so this this is this is their this is their new uh buzzword that they like to use this is their catchphrase or whatever but it says see it says repentance is a change of mind from Embrace of sin and rejection of Christ to a rejection of sin and embrace of Christ and even this is a gift of God genuine repentance when comes which comes when a person submits to the lordship of Christ cannot help but result in a change of behavior see brother Bram says here and and is that right yeah from uncertain sound brother man says repent means to turn around leave your belief behind start up the road believing God towards Calvary turn around start up the road and you will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you shall receive it if you follow the plan and here is here it is from proving his word says see a lot of people want Jesus to be their savior but not their lord see Lord is ruler yeah you say Jesus you saved me and let me stand right here and that's all right and I'll do my own business now you don't get in my business but you see you can be my savior but not my Lord he wants to be Lord you see then he's your savior so there's a people get it all out of out of the the way it should be they get it all backwards because they well I I want to I want a savior because I don't want to go to hell but it doesn't but they don't want to surrender they don't want to give up everything what it takes to come to that place but see in in Romans here see verse 13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved he said then how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent it says how beautiful are the feet of them that bring the good the preach the gospel of peace and bring Good Tidings of good things he says so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God see when you realize see it takes the faith and so you realize somebody's got to bring you the gospel you've got to hear the gospel you've got to hear the word you know it's just like well you know I you know I just just woke up one day and and had this realization no you got to hear the word it takes the word because the word is what bring births you so you've got to hear the word so that's what brings the message there's got to be somebody that's got to speak to you you got to hear it from somebody so you just can't just get it just right out of the right out of the ether you know it takes it takes somebody that it's got to come through the body the the seeds got to come through the body the words got to come forth so you can hear it now I'm gonna skip up just a minute but when when when you look at this this term this U lordship salvation is what they were calling him but this man was was quoting these things and this is this is one of the scriptures that this man was speaking of and what this is what caught my attention Luke 23:39 when it talks about the maleactors he said if the one says if thou be Christ save yourself and us and the other one says other answer rebuked him saying dust thou not fear God seeing that thou art in the same condem condemnation he said we indeed justly for we received the due reward of our Deeds but this man ha done nothing a miss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise when this scripture was read this man was speaking on this topic and when he read that scripture there was a a missing word and that's what caught my attention because when and I was like I want to check on this so I went to the emphatic diaglot and I want to read this and and this is this is the way it's written in the TIC diaglot verse 42 and he said to thee Jesus do thou Remember Me Oh Lord when thou comest into the kingdom of thee and when you go back I brought my emphatic dolot today but you know when I was looking because it's but it's in here but when you go back and look the new translations don't don't put the word Lord in that verse verse 42 does not have the word Lord in it it's missing go back and look and in the emphatic diaglot you know where that comes from the Vatican translation because if you look in here under Luke 23 it says omit and they took that word out and when I and so when when this man began to quote this scripture he was he was talking about the man on the thief on the cross and talking to Jesus and he was and that's what that's what struck me I was like he never used the word Lord and then he began to go and I was like oh I see that now because this new translations they don't put that in there and that's what that's what struck that's what struck me was when when he was talking about that how how they lay this out that you're missing these words and all of a sudden it's like well the the Bible doesn't say that the Bible doesn't say this the Bible doesn't say that and it's like yeah that's what the Bible says but you miss it see here they are missing these things and all a sudden when you realize you know he said Lord when when you come into my into the kingdom remember me and he said Thou shalt be with me this day in paradise brother BR says here and remembering the Lord he says Lord is ownership he said the landlord owns the land and the people today they'll glad to accept Jesus for a savior they don't want to go to hell they'll accept him as a savior but when it comes to the Lord oh uh-uh oh no uhuh Lord is you to be his property if he wants a floor mat he makes you a floor mat and you're just as happy a floor matat as you would be a morning star he said we don't want him to be Lord we want a savior but we don't want Lord then he comes Lord and he speaks to you about certain things of the word well now I don't know about that now see well just I just can't imagine me doing that you you ladies here you say I I get tired after a while no I won't so see it's like well you know I I get to this point well you know I I don't know about this I don't know about this but you know they they won't they want just pick and choose in the word what they want but they don't want to take all the word they don't want to receive everything here they are they they pick this and it's like well you know I well I you know I don't want I don't want to live that kind of life because you know if if I had to if I had to live like that then you know people people may make fun of me people wonder why you know but you know if if you are sold out you know because if if if you were in a in a in a certain condition like you know somebody rescues you out of the water you know if you're if you have if you have some kind of medical experience you you have some kind of heart attack and somebody rushes you to the hospital you know I mean you know if you're dying and you're going into the hospital you know it's like I really don't care uh you know because everybody's like well you know we hate going to the doctor because you know it's very uh we think it's kind of degrading it's kind of uh because sometimes you know there's no modesty in in the hospital sometimes you know it's just you just go in and you know they just start working on you and everything you know how it is and you know and it's like well you know I don't I don't want to have to go through that you know but if but if you're actually going through something if you're dying you get to that place you know what it don't matter you know I mean it's just like people that that's went through uh you know PE people that's went through fires you know when they when they go through when people have been burnt and you know when when they come out some people don't have clothes on and some some people when they're on fire and their clothes are on fire you know what modesty's gone because what do they do they're pulling they're pulling that stuff off of them why because they're trying try to preserve their life all of a sudden here they are they're just trying to shed these things why because they're trying because they're not worried about what everybody else is thinking what everybody else why because they're they've got to this place where it's life or death and you know what they they want to get to that and so when you see these things it's like I don't care what everybody else thinks when when you when you see what God's done for you it's like I don't care if nobody else baptizes acts 238 that's right if everybody else thinks we're weird because we but you know what I you know I just take it right back to the scripture you know what that because when he said baptize in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost well you know what there's only one time that you see there was a name where people were baptized when the day when the Holy Ghost fell and they indwelled those people Peter didn't go back and quote act Matthew 28:19 not the way people think because he said we're going to do this in the name of Jesus Christ because of according to verse 36 there he said that same Jesus whom you've crucified God has made him both Lord and Christ so when you see what what he done and then when you come to this place realize I I don't care if people don't see these things because you know you're not going to change people's mind because you know we're here to Proclaim the truth but you know what it's not we're not here to to win people over because that's God's job God Saves people all you do is proclaim the word you seow the seed but God does the rest because you know what when it comes to comes to the message you know because God put in the scripture that we see there was a there was a need for an end time Prophet because the word had to come to a prophet the word had to be revealed because he had to fulfill Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 those scriptures had to be fulfilled in our day and whether people sees that or not that's immaterial what what do you believe I believe that God had to had to fulfill the scripture in our day we can see all the way through the church ages how things went you know and what God done we we see that how how the seed that was back there at Pentecost had to die and go into the ground but it had to come back in a resurrection it had to come back we we know we had to come through the Dark Ages all those things that took place we can we can see the whole plan of God but you know that's so we see that hey you know what there people come along you know there was nobody back there that was ever baptized and and you go back before the Catholics came in and they started to have the the Nan fathers and all that there wasn't there was none of that nobody got baptized that way there was there was nobody preaching that as a godhead why because the same because the people that came from from back there they were come from a Jewish background why because there was only one God when the Messiah would come who would be the Messiah it was God made flesh not another person so when Paul began to preach the gospel when he began to preach he was not bringing another gospel he was preaching exactly what was preached back there he was preaching exactly what Moses preached and the prophets what David had spoke amen when he came he began to bring all those things back into view he was not a trinitarian but you can't but you can't get people to believe that you can't get people to see that and they'll fight you tooth and nail and it's like you can't sometimes you can't have conversation with people because you the first thing like how dare you not believe the Trinity and it and it's like but that but that's not what what it supposed to be but that's the way that that's the way people have preached it amen but see here's brother Brown speaking he said did you notice the Bible speaking of this church in this day because thou sayest that I am rich the richest times the church has ever had most prosperous age the church has ever lived in is now great buildings fine places educated scholar ministers he said we got better ministers than we ever had had got better churches than we ever had we got the world sinking every day into sin he said got weaker pull pits than than we ever had and that's why people they don't want to surrender themselves to God they don't want Oh They'll say I'm saved I let Jesus save me but you won't let him be Lord so he won't stay with you long that's the reason you go back into the world again that's exactly right I thought that was real interesting when I read that he says well I'm saved I let Jesus saved me well there ain't no letting about it no you had you had to surrender just like we was talking about somebody when you if you're drowning in a pool you know when when when the Lifeguard jumps in water you've got to surrender amen like you you get somebody out out there that you know they're going to fight you and you know panic and everything like that they'll drown you you can't you can't get them out but what happens when somebody's drowned in the pool and all of a sudden you know whatever you tell them to do they're going to do it 100% they're going under the water and you put something there and and you just tell them to hang on and rest and relax it's like well I don't think this is the way we ought to go out of the pool I don't think this the way we ought to get out of the water why are you going this way why are you going that way no if your lungs are full of water and all of a sudden somebody brings you the life preserver and you're just hanging on and somebody else is trying to swim out you know what I don't care which way they go I'm trusting them why because I'm in a position that I that I'm trying to get out and it's the same way with you and I we see when you're when you're in this position then you got work your got to follow the plan and like Lord I'm going to trust you cuz I don't know which way to go when you realize hey I'm me I'm lost and I can't make it and every day we go through the same thing because how many how many woke up this morning I need more of God today than I did yesterday I need more of God tomorrow than I had today why because the journey is is greater the battle is greater but every day but you know what he's there to lead us amen and got us all the way bring us through and here's a here's another scripture when I was listening to this man speaking he was speaking of of he was speaking of Paul and being in the prison in Acts 16 and he said and begin to speak of the The Keeper of the prison and he said and The Keeper of the prison waking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the the prisoners had been fled but Paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here then he cried for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas and brought them out and said s what must I do to be saved and they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house and what was so interesting because the scripture says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ but you know that's not what the script but that's not what the the uh the other translations say when it came out there he said well believe on believe on Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and I was like well that ain't what the Bible says and so you know I was I I brought that one because here they are you know they're want they're wanting a savior but they don't want a lord it's like well I'm saved well you know it's like well the problem is is people don't know what it means to be saved you know it's just like well well we're just we're just making the decision no when you realize that you're lost and when you're in a place that when you realize it comes down to a place where it's life or death when it comes to that place then you realize you know then you realize you come to a place God can do something for you brother BR says here in in Dr Moses he said when you he say when he talking about those that profess Christians he said but see that's the only way that you'll ever know what the real meaning of power and healing and salvation really means it is a spiritual revelation of the will and word of God you'll never learn it anywhere else only by Revelation when you realize where you where you came from and realize the condition that you're in God can do something for you I believe it was Moody that said God never turns us away empty unless we're full of ourselves but when you get to a place of full total surrender then God can do something for you and everybody's like well I I I want a savior but I don't want a lord well I want to make decisions for myself I I I saw a meme the other day and I don't know if any of y'all have seen it but it's but it's uh there's a there's a man and there's some sheep and there's there's this one sheep that's in the in the pasture and this man standing there and there's a ditch running in One Direction and then there's another one and it could be the same ditch might you just can't see it but you see one ditch right here in front and then you see another one going that this way across the pasture and it says you know how how how Christians are when we try to make our own decisions and do our own thing well here comes this sheep he's just running along having a great time and all of a sudden he falls right in this ditch well the man gets down there and you see him down there he's struggling working working working he finally gets the Sheep out of the ditch and gets him right up on the other side of the ditch on in the bank where that here he goes just takes off running just having a great time just just plowing through there and all of a sudden here's this other ditch next thing you know he goes Boop right in the other ditch and it's not that and he's not that far away from where he just come out of this ditch and he's right over there in another ditch and here's the same man he's got to go over there and get the Sheep out of the ditch again see that's the reason why we need we need a savior and a lord somebody got to come and get us out of the ditch but also we need someone to lead us we need a Shepherd to lead us because you know what because if we do the same thing lots of times we end up in the same place the same condition fighting the same battles that we've had before when the word has went forth to bring you to a place to deliver you from that and you go right back to it but see that's what God wants us to come to so we have to be surrendered to him amen see when you when you follow what God has for you I I'll be finishing here in a minute but brother Brown was speaking and he was talking about Moses and here's here's Moses you know God telling Moses there you know I've heard the Cry of my people by reason of their taskmasters and realizing the condition that the people are in and you know he he's he telling Moses you know Moses now's the time for you to be the deliver to break go down there and and pull these people bring them out this is the Fulfillment of the word and you know you know he's like well well I can't do this you know it makes all these excuses you know I can't speak and all these but you know God kept telling listen Moses you're the one this is your job you're the one to bring these people out because I'm come down but you're going to be my hands you're going to be my mouth all these all the things you're you're going to be the one that's going to do this and when you know when he goes down there and he begins to speak to the people you know all of his life he's had the greatest of the great he's had the lowest of lows here he is going through all of this don't know if he's going to get these people to believe him or not but God told him hey you're going to deliver these people brother Ram called him a oneman army oneman Invasion going down in there you know wife son on a donkey walking down through there greatest greatest military greatest army greatest nation there ever was and here he going down there where you going Moses I'm going to take over here he is going down there and you know he said you know the first thing he had to do when he began to tell them when it was time to leave and here here they are they they've seen they've seen the the the plagues and they've seen all the things that's taking place and he tells them listen you got to come take this this lamb and you got to roast it and you got to eat this lamb and you got to be prepared to go you got to have your shoes on your feet you got to have your staff in your hand you know you got your unleavened bread your bitter herbs your the lamb you got to roast all this together said you you got to eat the whole thing we're not picking and choosing it's the whole thing or nothing and see here they are that they had to go down there see and he said you got to go down there and sprinkle the blood on the door let me see if I I'm try here says Moses commissioned them to kill a lamb and to sprinkle it in the sign of the cross on the door and believer inside the door after sprinkling notice he said get the significance of the order of the scripture the believer once behind the blood could no more go out only through the approach had to go through the blood so here he is when when he begins to talk about see they had to put their themselves and believe so the first thing that they had to do is they had to believe what Moses said they had to believe that Moses Moses was the deliverer and what he said was true amen but you know they had seen they' seen the the water to blood they' seen all the all of the the things that taken place and here's this last thing you got to do you got to sell out and be ready to go and you got to put the blood on the door and you got to get everything ready and see when they done that they had to stand behind that blood here so they had to do exactly what said and the believer wants behind so you believe but then you got to do all these other things to get ready when said see if if they they didn't follow the sacrificial L it took it took this lamb where they didn't live because the death angel was passing through they were going to die but there was the one thing that they had to do and see they had to go through and they had to follow this and they had to get ready amen and eat that lamb he said because when the death angel passed through then they were leaving the death angel was there and he's like you know as the man was talking to his son was asking Daddy he said are you sure this is right well we're following what the word says we're following what the prophet said amen amen and so they had to follow exactly what he said so they had to follow the message that was given the word that was given him and they had to believe that that was the truth they had to believe what they heard was the truth then they had to follow what it said amen so when you follow what it said well then then if if you if you go up there and saywell I believe Moses is the prophet and I believe what he said and I believe I believe God sent him to deliver us well I I I just I just believe that but you know what the other thing they had to do is they had to follow what he saiden that's right the word came to them amen and they had to believe that and they had to do that am and they had so they were there and they had to follow that message not just believe it but they had to follow it they didn't get they didn't get to pick and choose what they want to do it was very it was very plain it was very detailed on what they were supposed to do there was there was there was no misunderstandings or anything in any of that if they wanted to be delivered amen and when they followed everything that God told them to do through Moses then guess what God brought them out right amen and it's the same way with you and I if we believe what God Said then we've got to do what he said to do and so if you if you you know if you want a if you want a savior you can't you can't have a savior without him being your Lord amen right amen you've got to realize that that he's going to be the one that's leading you to bring you through you just can't believe it because if you believe as as the first quote I read you know by my life would tell you if I believe or not right because the things that I do and then you'll see that then God will deliver you amen we see that we see the hour in which we live today and all the things going on you better be ready to go when he calls here I just want I want I want to read a few scriptures before I finish tonight but you know this this is one of the things that that come to me I started looking in the scripture you know there's so many times and the reason a reason I read 2 Samuel tonight because it's the first time the word savior is used in the Bible but it's the also the first portion of scripture that's the reason I read all three it's the first time you find the word in a in a portion of scripture where the word Lord is used but also the word savior is used because David says he's my Lord but he's also my savior but there's many scriptures and I just want to read a few of these Isaiah 4311 says I even I am the Lord and besides me there is no savior Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles and shall suck the breast of kings and thou shalt know that I am the Lord thy Savior and thy Redeemer the mighty one of Jacob amen Hosea 13:4 says yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt and thou shalt know no God but me for there is no savior besides me Luke 2:11 says For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord am Philippians 3:20 says for our conversation is in heaven from when also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ see there's so many times when you get when you start to look for that you know what say Savior and Lord Savior and Lord Paul and Apostle of Jesus Christ by the Commandment of God Our Savior and Lord Jesus Christ which is Our Hope amen yes so second Peter 21 says for an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he says for if if they for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worth them than with then with them than the beginning in second Peter 3:18 says but grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory both now and forever amen God bless you how many wants him to be your lord and savior I want him to be my all and all amen so if anybody asks you about well you know they they just want a savior well you know what if he ain't your lord he ain't your savior right you got it's a it's a total package amen you don't get to pick and choose as one or the other right amen amen let's all stand we'll have the musicians come because I want him to be everything I I don't want him to be just partway in my life life I want him to be everything Amen brother Joe can let's sing that song I surrender all All to
