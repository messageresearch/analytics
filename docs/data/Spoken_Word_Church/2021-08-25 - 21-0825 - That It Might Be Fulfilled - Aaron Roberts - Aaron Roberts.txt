each one of you and appreciate the lord getting us through and all of his blessings and we continue to pray for each one that's sick and needy and i don't know if brother bob mentioned it tonight i didn't i didn't hear but janine's at home tonight and i don't know if he mentioned that or not but uh jane's been sick she got a lot of nasal stuff and everything and just she ain't feeling too well so and y'all just prayed for her so she come home last night and tried to eat supper and after a while she just finally laid her head on the table so she was not feeling good so and because she started a new job she doesn't have any vacation or sick time or whatever she's just trying to play right through so y'all pray for her tonight and just remember a lady that i worked with her husband passed away yesterday and his name is tim bean and just remember the damn the bean family and all them they had just within the last few weeks they had just went to a house fire and it wasn't a full loss but if anybody's ever been to been to a house fire it ain't what they what gets burned up it's what gets damaged water damage everything gets wet and everything collapses if you ever go in a house and it's completely covered in wet sheet rock and insulation and and all that i mean there's just so much that gets ruined and and they just bought their daughter clothes for school and you know just a lot of different things and you know they've been trying to work on that and then he got sick and they ended up putting him in the hospital and then he was struggling and then just he took a turn and there was no turning back you just so y'all certainly remember her and and the two girls because i don't know what i do in their situation but we certainly can't hold them up because god is the one he's the god of all comfort he's a god of all answers so anyway i'll just remember them and i know brother rowell and all the different ones you know i think about you know different ones that have been sick and you you see that you know people have different issues and things going on but if i want to hold them up in prayer and because god is a god he has a prayer answering god and the thing is you keep holding them up for god because god said ask and you shall receive so we're just going to you know take him out of his word so god bless you now we're going to look in the scripture in matthew chapter one very familiar scripture and uh i titled this that it might be fulfilled which is part of the the scripture here than in the reading and we're going to tonight i i want to look at the life of jesus but i want to look at the birth of and the prophecies and i want and i want to with god's help i want to look at something because i want to read something that brother brown said because we understand that you know many times people look and they say well god spoke to peter and peter had a revelation well that didn't remove all of peter's doubts they didn't remove all of that peter's confusion you know but he didn't have a revelation so i just want to look at this that it might be fulfilled the scripture looking at the old testament prophecies in the life of jesus and just just in the first part of you know his life because i don't want to uh there's so many things to get into and i just want to cover this part i don't want to be long tonight but just uh share a few things with you and maybe we'll pick this up some other time but uh y'all just pray for me tonight the lord just have his way with us tonight so let's just all bow our heads and speak to the author tonight heavenly father lord jesus we're so thankful lord that we have another opportunity to come in your house father that we can come and lord just open open our hearts to you lord lord that we may receive from you what you have for us lord we've sung the songs of zion lord we've prepared ourselves for this time lord and lord we just want you to have the preeminence in the service lord that you

bind together lord and claim the promises lord you said that we would ask that our joy might be full lord lord as many of the sicknesses and afflictions lord many different things that are going people have questions and problems lord but we know that you're the answer to all the questions lord and father we just commit all things to you lord bless your ministers around the world lord so many that are lord and we think about the ones in the foreign countries afghanistan and the different ones father they're trying to proclaim the the word trying to proclaim the message and we see all the the problems that the enemy is rising up against them lord the lord you said when the enemy would come in like a flood he said you'd raise up a standard against them lord lord we stand with them find our faith with them and lord you just strengthen them bless us tonight lord give us give us the words lord i can i can study lord i can write notes but it takes you to come and speak to each heart you know we just committed to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen matthew chapter 1 verse 18 very familiar scripture it says now the birth of jesus was on this was when as his mother was espoused to joseph before they came together he was found she was found with child of the holy ghost then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus and he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name immanuel which being interpreted is god with us amen god bless you tonight you have your seats and i want to speak and looking at this and you know god has always wanted to make himself known and everything that he's done is is to make his self known it's you know he he was he dwelt along but when he created man he wanted to reveal himself in the fullness in in all things and and let uh reveal the you know who he was in in the essence of him make himself known and when he began to do that he had to speak to prophets there was an essential part in that you know he wrote he wrote three bibles we know he wrote one in the heavens we know we know it was the pyramid but he began to speak to man and he wanted man to know he wanted to speak to man to let him know who he was and his fullness but you know when he began to speak as brother wade was speaking the other day you know when when you look at when god began to speak in amos 3 when he said he said he would do nothing except he would he would reveal his secret to his servants the prophets when he began to speak see when brother brahm said this great mystery secret that god had from the foundation of the world he had this thing this thing that he wanted to make known well when he began to speak to the prophets the prophets began to see these things but then when they began to write about it see when when nahum was there and he saw the chariots jostling in the streets and the running with lanterns and running like lightning and all these things well he could express it in the words that he knew but but he couldn't express cars because he had never seen that but he began to express that now see it was a secret to nahum when he when he saw that thing just like when isaiah stood there and said behold a virgin shall conceive now that was what god spoke to as isaiah now he saw this and he began to speak it but the problem is just like many times whether i'm talking about the the prophets you know they had to stop and say well you know where did that come from because even even in their own speaking they were they didn't have full understanding of what they was just what they were speaking but they spoke what what god give them to speak they didn't have all the answers they didn't understand everything but they spoke what god gave them so when he begins to speak there was a the secret was when he began to make it known even in the heavens and everything that he began to do he was revealing it but it was a secret but he began but that was also a part of a revelation because he began to reveal himself he began to unveil himself but the problem is is has he began to unveil himself that created a mystery because because if if brother wade and i have a secret until i begin to speak of that nobody else knows about it but me and brother white that's the myth there's a secret between us so when he began to speak to him then they had to speak well they began to speak with what they began to speak make no sense to some people because that created the mystery but he began to unveil himself and he began to veil unveil himself all through the prophets as the scripture the prophets built the body well as they began to speak the word then they started to walk in the in the light he began to make himself known in the prophets so as he began to unveil himself through the prophets yet people didn't see that how many people understood that when moses walked and he began to speak that that was god veiled in flesh no that was just that honorary guy that pushed us around and made our lives miserable they just saw a man in flesh why because if if uh miriam what she would just become con he just moses just become common to her her it was just her brother it was just a common person and aaron in the same situation that they would say something against moses and not realizing he was the anointed prophet then what happened see god come back to miriam and rebuked her for for saying against the prophet now to her it's just her brother but to god see it was an important office and she did not uh honor the pro the office of the prophet so she didn't see so many times they you know as as jesus began to speak later on you know he's like you know how many of the prophets that you didn't kill but you but you uh honor their supplicures and all these things but you killed them you stood against them you didn't you didn't stay with their word but now years later when they look back oh what a great prophet jeremiah was you know what a great prophet isaiah was but the when but when you look at the forefathers when he turned back when jesus began to point them back to their fathers and their forefathers he said he said look what they didn't they didn't honor moses they didn't honor any of these things and as and as time progressed we see how things begin to open and because because of them not staying with the word they created their own denomination now brother branham said here and he said why am i against organized religion he says he said so see nicodemus's organization understanding meant nothing to god now no matter if he was a big shot as we call it in the organization a master in israel of all his learning and understanding it didn't mean that when he stood before christ only a rebuke to him now i imagine all the people say holy father nicodemus holy father nicodemus we bow to you sir but when jesus he stood before god he rebuked him for his ignorance so you see what all that goes to forget it come on let's go to god that's right all right neither did cora's great understanding mean anything or adam's each denying god's vindicated message now let's listen close now we're going to get into some high waters in a minute see each one of them the reason that they got in trouble nicodemus cora nimrod and so forth is because they didn't recognize god's messenger with the vindicated word of that day anyone knows that no we've said that that a long time but god predicts and says a certain thing will take place man makes organization gets man set just exactly they believe that there was a coming messiah owe them jews oh my sure but when jesus come the way he did they said that can't be him they fail to understand the word now jesus didn't come contrary to the word did he but he come contrary to the organization interpretation of the word moses didn't come contrary to the word but he come exactly with the word but cora failed to see it and all down through it's that way and he says now look this message of the day just can't be something saying we got the truth and we got this and that he said it has to be foretold in his word then after the word is brought forth it has to be properly vindicated by the word jesus was properly vindicated of god by the word he said if you had known moses you'd have known me known of my day well did the prophet speak of him well all the prophets said what he was and yet it blinded them they couldn't understand it see but jesus was and i don't i want to say this for the tape and for you see the messenger with the message of the day now some of y'all probably got probably have some idea of where i want to where i want to go with all this but i want but i want i want to lay a background looking at the life of jesus because when you see the life of jesus and and you see there's so many things that when you when you begin to study all of the things that when jesus came and all of the the things of the scripture and the jews and i mean you know brother brethren i said one time he was talking about you know he said we got 900 denominations and he said you know the the pharisees they had like four or five you know the pharisees the sadducees all the religious jews of the day they all had he said they all had their own way he said he said when he began to prophesy and when the scripture began to speak and they began to speak of of john coming that there would be a forerunner to jesus before the messiah would come now when they began to speak and he would say that he was going to come but yet when they looked they were looking for somebody great because of all the scriptures that that the old testament prophets and all of the religious leaders had read there was nothing in the life of john that fulfilled any of the scriptures he didn't he didn't fulfill any of that but he fulfilled the scriptures but it took because you know when you're when you're looking they were looking forward to the prophecies but it takes looking back because jesus spent all of his time pointing them back to the scripture showing that the scriptures had already been fulfilled because how many times did they stand there and even when they asked jesus about elijah coming and he said you know we thought elijah would come and he said he shall truly come but i tell you he's already come and then they perceive by is what he said then they realized that he was speaking of john john had come and fulfilled the scripture but they didn't see that when the when the uh when the when campus and or cleopas and then on the road to emmaus when they began to speak they began to speak the whole time of the word in the presence of the word and they didn't realize what was going on and that well and even when he began to when jesus began to speak to him and tell him shouldn't all these things have taken place didn't you hear these things didn't you know these things and yet they were dull of hearing they were blind and he spent all that time beginning to speak to them but when with jesus when the word came so as the prophecies began to unfold for jesus to come there were many that didn't uh see those things because he said you know they had been taught all of these things by the by the religious leaders of the day and brother bradham says in in the message the evening messenger he says now take for instance jesus this is quote number two brothers he said now take let's take for instance jesus how hard it was for him to come and change the message from law to grace yet the bible said it would come that way there'd come a messiah and the daily sacrifice would be taken away now we know it was prophesied through the prophets what a great thing it was for him to do that but we find we find that he did it and the one he did it because the scripture said and the believers of that day so-called believers absolutely would not agree with him look at all those pharisees and sadducees they had their own traditions and not one's going to shake them from it that's what they believed their mother believed that their daddy believed that and their grandpa grandma believed that and moses said so but the same moses that give the law was the same moses said this guy would come and they failed to recognize it because they had got the true word of god in traditions and had left off the main principle of it and it had and it had to be that way so when they began to speak they he began to speak but they had their own traditions they had their own ideas about how things would be but it was you know as jesus as the prophets began to speak to to the people see each time he the prophets came and each time they came they pointed the people back to the prophecies that had already come and began to speak to the people about about what had been spoken and trying to point them back and tell him y'all have erred and how many times did he raise like jeremiah and the different ones god rose them up and tell them you go speak to them and tell them when he began to speak to him he said he said he said you have left me the fountain of living water and he said you have hewed out cisterns he said broken cisterns i can hold no water now you know how how silly is a person when you come to a place when you when you're seeing i you have left an artesian whale of living water and god began to speak back to that living water the whole time and he told them he said y'all chewed out your own cisterns he said he said you're dry you have no water you have nothing but he said i keep pointing you back just as the children of israel was with moses and he began to lead him he told me listen i'll bring you out by a strong hand when he began to bring the children of israel out of bondage they thought how are we going to how are we going to come out but you know they had enough faith to believe in what god said they stood there with their shoes on at their staffing their hand and eating the even the eating that lamb that had been cooked complete yeah whole know it always amazes me when that when he talks about how they cook you know he said they couldn't separate anything they had to cook it whole well you know you know the intros and all that kind of stuff is in there when you cook that thing it might not have been the greatest smelling food you ever had in front of you but you know what it spoke of the entire word the fullness of the word had come that they were supposed to eat they were to eat of that word and then they were supposed to come and then at the midnight they were at the time they were supposed to leave he said when the death angel come through he said it was going to destroy them he said but you'll come out of this he said why because you've marked the door so when you've marked the door then you have then you have a protection why because you followed the word so when you followed the word then when he come then when the death angel passed he could not touch them but the ones that didn't have faith that didn't believe then there was death but then it was all the time that they come out and as they begin to come out of out of bondage then here's here's this amazing thing that you know pharaoh didn't want them to leave but you know what they were able to leave but you know the first the first hiccup they had the first little problem they had and they all fell apart even moses did that's right he's out there getting what lord what am i going to do he said why christ down to me speak and go forward he said you've been anointed you've been called you've been you've been brought to this place so if you've been brought to this and why are you crying to me he said you know what to do so then he began to speak and do the things that god told him to do that it was time for him to go and they cost over then when when they crossed over the red sea then when they come over then in the midst of all that then they look back and saw their enemies coming he's like well you know what we're not getting into i thought we're going to get away from them here they come where are we going to go now well you know what they didn't wait on god see they should have been up there rejoicing why because they were getting ready they were looking at destruction their enemy was being going to be destroyed right in front of them but they were saying oh i don't know how we're going to get through this do you see all that that big cloud of smoke or dust coming up from those chariots here they come and you know they're so worried all we're going to do now moses look at him but what'd he say stand still see the salvation of god then when they saw their enemies destroyed you know then they had pentecostal revival they were rejoicing but i mean they couldn't they couldn't see the miracle that god had done for them but the next time they had a problem they wanted to come and argue with moses it's like uh y'all remember the red sea miracle army getting killed you remember that right well that's what god done yesterday we don't know what he's gonna do today but he promised him that he'd take him to a land flowing with milk and honey it's like out here in the wilderness are you in the are you gonna lay enough milk honey no well guess what you still gotta go he didn't he didn't leave them just in just in the old testament when you began to look when he hit when he made the ark of the covenant the ark of the testimony as the scripture calls it when you see the alt or the testimony what was it what was it about the test the ark of the testimony what was that that was that was not only was it a rebuke to them but it was but it was a monument it was a token to them of what god had done for them one because he brought them through and he fed them and he brought them through and they they wanted to argue who was going who was going to lead us who was going to lead us well they put all the rods in and before the ark of the covenant in the holy place and guess what it aaron's rod budded the rest of them didn't but it was a supernatural event to the people but he showed who he had called it was a supernatural so when when they had when they had aaron's rod that had budded and the almonds he was showing that god had done a supernatural event to them he had done the supernatural when he fed rain manna down from heaven every single day and they went out and they and they gathered every man to their their fullness and they never went hungry but he took an omer of that and he put it in there and every time the priest would come up and he would enter into the priesthood he could go in there and eat that but it was a testimony to them and the tablets of god speaking the word to them god spoke to the word and what was it they it was god in letter form but they thought they were just getting rules they did not see that it was a supernatural happening moses is in the mountain and god's speaking to him and he's writing the word in the tablets and they're down there messing with a golden calf but he began to speak to oh they thought well god had left us out here we're out here moses in the mountain he's gone what are we going to do well we got to get it we got to start a denomination out here we got to have our own well they got away from god in our and god was you know stay where you are god you're right where you need to be but not not to them they have oh we got it we got to work out we get nervous and here they are they're going right out and getting into the end of these things turning their back on the word and yet god laid that testimony out there the ark and he said listen he said it was a rebuke to them because they did not believe the word but it was a rebuke to them because god followed them all the way through he carried them all the way through he blessed them all the way through but they were the ones that turned him down he didn't turn them down and it's the same thing brother sisters you know we have been so blessed this is from the message presuming it's number three he said when god when john came to introduce which was the right way the pharisees had their way sadducees had their way the publicans had their way different ones had their way their denominations organizations john didn't go to any of their schools he went in the wilderness and waited he studied the word the first thing you know god told him out there in the wilderness that this messiah would have a sign following him as he always did what he talked about last night what we talked about last night so john waited he didn't join any of them he just waited till he was sure he didn't presume anything he said no wait see there's the pharisees they're good people they're holiness people why sure that's all right he didn't i presume they're all right that wasn't god see john waited for the sign john waited till he was sure see certainly did he didn't presume he waited until he was sure he had seen the true sign of the messiah he said nathan as soon as he as irritable as he could be see he just said now i don't believe it i'll have to see it when he got up there and seen it was the messiah it was satisfied then he said he didn't presume he just waited until he'd seen it so each one of them so they had their own way they had their own ways of seeing things but god had spoken to them through the prophets but instead instead of waiting like john did john waited he didn't understand he but he saw what was given to him that that the messiah would be there with a sign right but they you had to wait on him to give the revelation he said he waited for him the sign to take place he knew what was going to take place and then when when that took place then he would he would know who was who was the one but see when you go back and and study the the pro the prophecies and you know many times what we look at we look at the denominational world that we live today and even the the message in and around this message and we see so many things that people believe and preach and and it's like you know i mean people will believe things that's not even in the scripture and things that are even contrary to the things that brother branham said in black and white but what is it they don't they don't hold to to the to because it's like well i've you know they've got to presume they got to try to answer these questions no you wait on god i know i don't try to figure these things out we because god didn't tell us to figure it out he told us to believe it because if you believe these things then it be made known to you and as he began he's speaking to the uh the disciples you know he said he said if you believe these things he said the greater things you'll see but you have to believe these things and wait on god because at the right time god will let these things be made dawn and you know when i began to look at these things and and you see the the situation and and the the history of of a lot of uh the things that that are spoken of the uh of the prophets and the messiah and a lot of the the um jewish understanding you know many times people that's the reason i was struck by what brother brown was talking about he said you know the pharisees and the sadducees you know they all had their own own way of things the way they done things what they believed and you know even even down through history you go back and you start to read all of the the re the writings of the prophets of the rabbis and you think you think that we we live in a screwed up mess and then you begin to see that even though even the rabbis had their problems i mean it was so it was so because when you go back and you start to look because and you know because the scripture tells us one of the biggest problems that the jews had is that because jew the jews when they saw the writings of when they when you look at the writings of the messiah the the writings of the messiah have to do with a mighty conqueror you know because you know when you start to if you go back and look and as you know he talks about isaiah 9 6 says for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this so when they began to speak of the messiah they saw a mighty conqueror that's all they saw because when they were looking forward to the prophecies that's all they saw because there was lots of prophecies that were given that they don't attribute to the messiah because all they saw was a mighty conqueror because when when moses stood up and said god will raise up a prophet like unto me then they look forward to a mighty conqueror and when they when they look at the scriptures of david he said he said he was set on the throne of david well they're looking for a mighty conqueror he said the government shall be on upon his shoulders and he said upon his kingdom he said there shall be no end so when they began to look that's all they saw was a mighty conqueror there's coming a day where we will rule the world our god will be the the god of this of the world he will there will be a kingdom set up that will that will establish peace and prosperity and all these things all throughout the world and that's what they're looking for that's all they see when they begin to look forward to see and so all of the you look at all the scriptures that's all that's all they can see is a mighty conqueror but they don't see the rest of it and so when they begin to argue there's there's many scriptures that that you look at in the writings of the uh rabbis all the way back through history you know they they all they all had some odd ideas about things in genesis 3 15 it says i will put my enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now they they a tribute to when you go back and read some of that do you know they attribute that to adam and his descendants they don't attribute that to one person and even even in in some of the categories when you begin to look at the writings and they even have some rabbis in the past when they begin to speak of these things and they would say well what about this and what about that do you know that some rabbis actually believe there to be two two messiahs why because they said well the one messiah has to be the mighty conqueror but the other one will suffer it's like have you you know and it's like you wonder why brother i'm talking about there was 900 different denominations in the in the pharisees and the sadducees and all them they all had their own ways of looking at things why because they could they couldn't wrap their mind around that that the that the messiah would come like when brother rambled speaking to the rabbi that day and he asked him about isaiah 9 6. see when he began to look at that you know he said well tell me what part of it he didn't fulfill see when they began to look at the scriptures see they they saw that mighty conqueror but there was a lot of things in the scripture they couldn't put together but instead instead of just waiting on god to show these things what they do they started making their own denominations and then one says well it's this way and one says it's that way and then they don't need to even attribute genesis 3 15 to the messiah and then when when you begin to look at all these things i mean they're they're so over the years that they've come up with all these ideas and no wonder when you when you begin to look at all these things that were written one of the things that some of them were writing about was that the messiah didn't even have to be born a virgin someone believe hey as long as long as he was born and he was anointed he was anointed the messiah so when so when you when you when you get begin together about these things and even even today the the jews there's a groups of jews that don't even believe they ought to be in the homeland they're against they're against being in palestine they don't even believe because they don't believe that they should be there until the messiah comes so when you begin to look at all these different things and even even when it comes to the scriptures of daniel of daniel 9 when you begin to read some of the writings of the daniel 9 and even then they don't even attribute that to the messiah and some of the writings that were written they don't even they attribute to other people didn't even attribute that to and they were talking about all these different ones that come through and one of the problems that they had was they couldn't understand the 70 weeks because they couldn't understand it because they couldn't line up the 483 years but but they have all these groups and one says well i believe it's this one and i believe it's that one and you know they were they were so they're so con convinced of what they believe that you know that they said that the prophet was wrong when he gave the dates and the years and the weeks they are so convinced of what they believe that they stand there and say that none of this is correct because it's spiritual time it's not natural years and some of them sit there and they're trying to figure this thing out and say well some of them don't believe it's 30 days to a month and that's and and that's a jewish that's a jewish law that's a jewish calendar to have 30 days in the i mean that's jewish law and yet they they have all these things and they try to prop these different things why because they don't understand it and so you begin to i mean when you begin to read some of these things and you and you wonder why when when you begin to see all these things when when the scriptures become to come if people if people had been pulled all these things and everybody was confused on all these different things then when he said when jesus came he said you're not in because you don't fit the scripture but what did what did brother brother brown said he said it's because you didn't fit their organizational their interpretation of the word you didn't you didn't fit their interpretation of the word not what was spoken why because they keep looking forward but they can't understand why because it takes god to give the revelation and then when he began to point back to the scriptures then he begins to open up and he began to see the revelation of it and it takes it takes god to do that but see they were so they were so confused on all these things and what was going to take place and when jesus began to speak to the to the disciples and he began to express all these things that he had spoken of himself and yet they were so confused on all these things and were still waiting on these things because that's all they were gripped by because here he was and he began to speak to him of all these scriptures and he began to point them back and he began to speak even when he spoke to the pharisees and he began to expound on the parables of the scripture and he began to open up the scriptures and he began to speak and rebuke and then the pharisees could give him an answer and they said why do you speak to them in parables so they don't understand but he said it's given to you to know the mysteries and so when they came they said well please explain us to the parable of the sower please explain us the parables so then he began to express the parables so when they began to look back he began to show them all the things that they had seen then they was like oh we understand that but in the but when it comes to after his resurrection when he was risen and he was about to leave them then the first thing that come out of their mouth is it now that you're going to restore the kingdom to israel and what did he say it's it's not this is not the time you forgot to know these times it's not for you to know these things he said he said but the one thing that i'm going to tell you the one thing that you will know of the things that you've known and i've breathed on you to receive the holy ghost he said you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and he said you shall be witnesses unto me in in jerusalem and judea and he said even the uttermost part of the earth so you'll be witnesses of me but you won't know these things but you but he said he said when he the spirit of truth has come he said he's going to lead you and guide you into all truth so the thing is is they held on so when when peter stood there and in matthew in 16 when when jesus was speaking to peter and he and to the disciples and he asked him he said who do men say that i the son of man am when he began to ask them well we've heard all kinds of stuff that's right you're jeremiah one of the prophets you're you know you're somebody but who do you say that i am he said you're the christ the son of the living god it's what god jesus said blessed aren't you peter because god has revealed this to you this is what god has revealed to you amen and he said listen he said that's what we're going to build the church home he said upon this rock a revelation what god showed you he said that's what we're going to build the church on and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it when we see all the scriptures that were written all the way through the through the scripture and he began to speak of all the things that had taken place yet he want he wanted them to know these things but he began to speak to him and you know even even when he rose from the dead and you know he was standing there in the and the ladies had went to the the sepulcher to uh prepare the body and they and he come and he told them listen he's risen and they couldn't believe it so we can't believe what he rose from the dead and the bible tells us he said and they remembered his words after all these things and they began to remember the words that he had spoken to him and so you know all the way through the scripture we began to see these things that that god had been speaking to the people and yet they didn't see these things even when we go back you know you think you think of those that you know they were the devout people that that were looking for these things and yet when when the things began to unfold to them they didn't see it you know what what amazed me is you look at the scripture in the in the in the scripture of jesus and we see that here here are these men they are talking about the the magis and you know the the great men they spent all of their time studying the stars they studied all of the sky and they knew everything they knew what was going to take place when they saw those supernatural things take place in the sky they knew something was going to take place and they come all of that way traveling for years to get to jesus and when they got there then they said where is he that was born king of the jews now what now listen we go to synagogue every day we got rabbi so-and-so preaching to us all the time well you what do you mean you got some who do he's out here come in there talking about the where is he born king of the jews what what are you talking about we don't know nothing about this but they began to expound what god had showed them what he had showed those magi that's and something had had quickened in them so much for them to journey all that way that wasn't going around the corner i wasn't going across town as long arduous journeys cold heat robbers you never know what those men had had to face all the way but something struck them and they went all this way and here and here here are these people good hearted honest people and they come in there and and when when mary had heard when gabriel had spoke to her she knew she had a revelation she knew what had taken place joseph knew what had taken place they had an angel visitation they it was it was supernatural to them they knew what took place but you know what a lot of people didn't believe that they didn't follow that and you know what there was a lot of days she probably didn't want to go out in public that's right when you when you have everybody that runs you down and you know when when they like brother ram talked about you know when he was when he was a young man and walked down the sidewalk people would walk on the other side of the side you know across the street because they didn't want to walk beside him and here's mary fulfilling god's word and they didn't want to have anything to do with her and she walked and had had to go through all that ridicule and all those things but you know what she knew what was in what was in what had taken place what god had showed her what joseph but when all of a sudden one of these days these men come in no doubt they probably looked a little funny probably looked a little different if they come from a far country they probably didn't dress like people in bethlehem or where you know nazareth galilei where they probably didn't dress the way they did probably had a little bit different speak language but when they walked in there that day and they saw that young child after they'd come all that way and they brought gold frankincense and myrrh when you think about what mary had heard and what the scriptures had said because when you know when gabriel had spoke to her when she went back and started reading the old testament prophets what isaiah and it became a brand new book to her it was it was it was illuminated well everybody else is looking forward but you know what she's starting to see these things open up and then when she when she saw that he shall save his people from their sins well if she understood what the gifts were that were brought by the wise men when you saw those gifts when they were bringing those things in no doubt it stirred something in that mother's heart to see men from a far country bring in and it was gold deity dedicated to death the gold frankincense and myrrh and if you if she understood what those things represented you know it had to touch her to see those things when she had when she had reached when jesus had reached the eighth day and they took him into the temple and you know simeon said i won't pass until i see the lord's christ and she was standing in that temple and no doubt no people some people wouldn't look at her and you know she was she was the off-scale of the earth you know as soon as she walked into that temple that day the holy spirit began to speak to simeon the fulfillment of the prophecy is here and it meant something to simeon and everybody well he's got one foot in the grave and went on a banana peel you know he's he's a good man but you know he's he's starting to slip a little bit you know he's oh we just we just humor him you know but when he walked out there that day and took that little baby in his arms and he stood there and held it oh my goodness thank god my eyes have seen my salvation it didn't mean anything else to other people people just stood there looked at him he hadn't lost his mind what's going on here and then anna began to prophesy of who he was and what he was supposed to do it didn't mean the other people they just saw this act they just saw these things they didn't mean anything but it spoke something to mary because she had walked all this time and those things but then she began to see these things open up and it's the same way see these things have begun to open up the world the world is not called to these things that's right but it's more precious than gold so when we see these things they were written in the scripture to know and it's and it's now time for these things to be fulfilled you know i went to my aunt's funeral monday and the and the preacher was up and and he he was speaking of of the of the things and he's like you know we don't understand all things paul said we don't see we see through like a glass darkly we don't see all these things but he said we know what paul said we know what god said and so it's not for us to understand these things but he said he said he's given these things he's for us to believe for us to trust in god when we see these things and he began to speak all the things through the scripture and he was and there were certain things that he began but he was talking about my aunt passed away and she had she had dementia that's not what killed her but uh she passed away from it she suffered with it for a number of years but you know we saw about you know we only see so much while we're here but he said he said then as time progressed she didn't know she knew less and less and then she was in a only world she didn't know her own family she didn't know anything but he said there's a beautiful day coming he said when she crossed over she had complete understanding there was a place that she went to that god began to show her these things he said he said i don't know he said i can i can tell you what the scripture says and he said i believe the scriptures he stood there and he said i don't know if god's coming to take this this body these elements that's in this casket i don't know if he's going to take these out or if he'll just create a body out of elements but he said i know we're going to have a glorified body amen he said i don't understand all the scriptures he said but i know we're going to be called up we're going to meet each other and we're going to be meet him in the air he said i don't know how all that's going to work out or all the he said we all got questions we don't know because we read things but he said there's a day coming we're going to have complete understanding amen and you know the thing is is each day god wants to reveal something to you and you know it's you know sometimes it takes a long time we we read the same thing over and over and over and you know we have our own thoughts our own ideas about things because when you read something as a human it automatically creates a picture in your mind when you hear things all things automatically kick in your mind but then there comes a time that it has to be made known as peter said you know as a child as a child i spoke as a child i understood as a child but he said when i became a man he said i had to put childish things away there's a lot of things that we don't understand but you know we trust in god amen but you know there's a blessing because he said a real true eagle will understand peter peter and all of the disciples here they are walking in the midst of all this confusion and all the things that had happened and all the things that they saw but you know what they held on to what god had revealed to them amen and let's just hold to what god has revealed to us unless the musicians stand and come let's stand let's sing that song hold to god's unchanging hand because you know that's what we have to do we have to build our hopes and not just hopes but you know because it is it's a a hope because brother ram said our faith the majority of our faith is a mental faith but he said when the word is poured into that mental faith he said it becomes a spiritual revelation hold on to the things that god has said to you we know we know these things and he said hold on hold to god's unchanging hand because we may not know what things are going to happen but we know who holds tomorrow i was speaking to somebody the other day and they were we was talking about things that how things have happened and we don't see the future and a lot of you know a lot of questions and i told them i said i i got no worries about things i know i know what it was i was talking to somebody about the covet shot and i said well i i plan on taking it but if i had to i'd take it i told him i said i got i got confidence in god i said you know what he's brought me 47 years i i've made it i've made it this long and you know you can say well it was mom and daddy and and all this you know what it was god that got me here god it's been the grace of god i got 47 years you know all the different ones that have been here you know many many years that you know 80 plus years and all that it's been god that's got us here you know because the scripture says you know grace has brought us this far and grace will lead us home amen i said god's brought me this far 47 years i've made it and i said everything has come and gone god's always been been my deliverer he's always been my waymaker he's always been my physician but if i told him i said but if i had a job that required me to take the shot you know what i told him i said brother dale always tells us when we get medicine he said come get you a prayer cloth and take it they said go put in your medicine cabinet he said he said do the doctor's program well if if push come to shove where i had to then you know what i'd take it because you know what there's no weapon formed against me that'll prosper but you know what if i don't take the shot it's still no weapon formed against me shall prosper the devil can't touch me unless god allows him to i'm not i'm not i'm not worried i've made it this far you know there's things when you look back at your life you shouldn't be here and you wonder why things have happened in your life and they worked out the way they did and many times we wonder you know it it looks like it looks like a mess and never did understand why things happen and when we look back then we begin to see you know what's been the hand of god that's brought us all the way through there when we didn't see the blessings of god when we were looking forward at things when we're going through things we don't see the blessings of god when we get to look back and see what god's done then we've seen that god's brought us through so if if something comes my way then you know what i'm st he's still the one that's in control you know none of us are promised to make it through the night but you know what i got confidence in god that if i left this world i got a place to go to amen i all i can all i can do is put trust in him he's brought me this far he's the one that called me and filled me with the holy ghost and you know what i have failed him and you know you look you see sometimes you look to be an unprofitable servant but you know what there's still grace there there's still grace no matter how far you go if you're a son or a daughter of god there's always grace god's always calling you back sometimes we wonder it's just so amazing to us what god has done for us amen but you know what i have trust in god i can't trust nothing else the world is falling apart there's nothing you can put trust in you know we're worried about silver or silver and gold and houses and lands and properties and and all these things it's all cannon fodder it's all going to be burnt up one day you know when god comes back you know he's not going to live in this filthy world he's not going to have any any part of this many times we get worried about frustrated about things that happen one of these days it's all going to be the former things are will be passed and it will never come into our remembrance so we just live day day by day and trust him amen god bless you now we're going to sing hold to god's unchanging hand it's filled with swift [Music] [Music] to god's unchanging hand [Music] whatsoever years may bring if my earthly friends foresee kind still more closely to him clean i'm singing oh to god's unchanging end hold to god's unchanging [Music] to god's unchanging [Music] [Music] seek to gain the heavenly treasure [Applause] they will never pass away i'll sing and hope [Laughter] [Music] [Music] eternal and oh to god's unchanging end when your journey is completed if to god you have been true fair and brought the home in glory your enraptured soul will view i'm singing hope to god's unchanging and yes hold to god's unchanging hand build your hopes on things eternal yes holy to god's unchanging hands amen when our journey is completed we don't know what our journey is going to be completed but you know what god gives somebody a commission somebody's going to walk all the way to a body change he said you know paul said behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep we shall be changed you know there's a journey for us to go and that's why we say our journey is going to be completed one of these days there's a group that's going to be waiting here that's not going to hinder amen those that have passed on so we're fighting that fight we're going to continue to believe trust god hold hold of god's unchanging hand all right god bless you tonight and we're going to turn over brother white he's got some announcements and everything so god bless you let's give our brother a good hand good job hey man just a few little
