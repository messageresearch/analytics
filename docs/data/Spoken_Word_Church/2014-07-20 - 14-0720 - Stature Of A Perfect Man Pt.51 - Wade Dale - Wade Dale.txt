TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Jesus talking about the great commandment so let's read verse 34 but when the Pharisees had heard that he put the Sadducees to silence they were gathered together one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him say master which is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment now when you get into Mark we're going to read Mark Mark's going to give you a little bit different version but it's not different but what's the first commandment here you oh Israel your God is one all right and you can't love one if you think there's two or three so he's saying here Thou shalt love the Lord thy God not the Lords or one of the Lords right so he's saying one one God all right so one God is the greatest commandment is to know that he's one the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets see how strong that is all right then they continue to ask him another question about what think you of Christ whose son is he but now let's go to Mark 12 Mark 12 and 28 we going to get a another view what model app is that I like uh U version or you I'll show you in a minute Mark 12 now here's pretty much the same thing so same the same situation now here's Mark Writing and Jesus answered him the first of all the Commandments is here oh Israel the Lord our God is one God and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these so we've come up to brotherly kindness and I looked up the word commandment the word commandment means order a charge a precept or a prescribed rule that one must go by all right so Jesus is telling them not not taking the other eight Commandments away cuz you got the one there's all there's one with Pro the first one with promise which is what honor your father and mother that your days may be long on the face of the Earth that's the first commandment with promise right but the first one is L love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your your mind and then the second one Jesus brings in I don't think that's in the order if you'll look in Exodus you can I don't think the second one is that one the second one is another one and then you go down a little further but he brings all the Commandments together and brings two of them if you'll love the Lord your God and love your neighbor as yourself you won't kill him because it says Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal you won't steal from your neighbor if you love him you understand so what Jesus is doing is he's taking all all these Commandments and he's taking them and saying hey if you'll get these two right the first time right you won't have to worry about the other eight the other eight will come in under those two and the same way with brotherly kindness brotherly kindness in the pyramid is right up there at the top but it's it's a culmination of all the faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience and godliness that we've been talking about it all culminates in that brotherly kindness cuz you you can't have brotherly kindness and not have Temperance that's right that's right some part of temperance you got to have definitely patience to have patience with your brother brother what he said have patience with your brother all right if you don't see the same thing you see all right let's go to second John or John 2 2 John 2 John 1 verse 4 and here's John I Rejoice greatly that I found of thy children Walking In Truth as we have received a commandment from the father and now I beseech thee lady so who she talking to not a woman sitting there she talking to the church and I beseech thee lady not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another and this love that we walk after his Commandments this is the Commandment that as you have heard from the beginning you should walk in it what he narrows it down to one that we love one another now watch what brother brandham says though brother Bram says you take Godly love which is agapa love which is unconditional and I heard a little I saw a little thing the other day and I think it's kind of cute and uh it's a joke but uh it's really not a joke but um this man gets to the Pearly Gates and I don't know why they got Peter at the ply gate I don't know why they got somebody standing at the ply Gates but anyway all the stories come up with Peter standing at the at the perly Gat I guess Peter's a pretty rough character so they got him standing there weeding them out I guess he's got the KE ke he's got the Keys of the Kingdom that's good all right so he's got the key to the gate so he walks in so this guy walks up and St Peter says oh wait a minute we've changed things you got we're on a point system now you got to have 200 points before you can enter Heaven and it's got to be it's got to be what you've done on Earth yeah and the guy said well the greatest thing I know I've done I've been married for 50 I'm married 50 years never committed adultery never done anything against my wife we had a wonderful marriage St Peter said well that's good that's worth two points you got said two points so he says well what else did you do said well I you know built a building for the homeless or something you know he said well that's good for one point and he went through a bunch of things didn't have about Five Points built up and he everything he done in his life you know he said he said well how am I going to make it said only by the grace of God can I make it and Peter said there's your 200 points there's your 200 points in or in he finally got him down to where it was by the grace of God he made it in not by what he done down here so that's the same thing here but still they're connected they're still connected you still got to love you still got to do the Commandments of God oh that guy was on do and don't he was on I didn't do this I did do this I did this but the grace of God listen it's only by the grace of God my point is is that we can love each other that's right it's only by the grace of God that we can love somebody that actually hates you right that's right I mean actually it's easy for it's easy for somebody to love you that loves you that's right but for somebody that just absolutely Gres your chees you know I mean that little baby had a jubilee yesterday she finally got out amongst Brethren and sisters and she was shouting and praising the Lord and laughing and jumping up and down she was having a good time it was good to having her at fellowship meeting but look at second John and this is love that we walk after his Commandments this is the Commandment that as you have heard from the beginning you should walk in it that's the love one another for many deceivers are enter into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh this is the deceiver and Antichrist look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that re we receive a full reward so it's culminated in a reward and we do get a reward and I was thinking the other day and I think I'm going to maybe do a a message on it or something maybe not down here but upstairs Moses Abraham remember it started he started as Abram right he started as Abram there was things went on with Abram that were right right remember he he walked with God he he done the things even as Abram but when he become Abraham other things came into view it wasn't Abram anymore it was Abraham and there was more things what I'm saying is we got a lot of Abrams that can produce something but it's a wild child It produced a promise but it wasn't the promise God was talking about so we got a lot of Abrams and even when you're born again I believe you're an Abram you get up you walk with God hey Abram's Journey was justification sanctification into the baptism of the Holy Ghost right that was Abram right that was Abram wasn't Abraham it was Abram and he produced a child during that time he produced a lot of things he even met MDC when he was Abram he met MDC so you got to do the same thing and that journey of justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been preached and preached but I want to take it more as a level of of us already in the message there's a lot of Abrams that's just going to produce a wild child but you know what he's going to walk with God cuz Abram walked with God watch read your Bible Abram walked with God Abram was not some wild you know camel Chaser or whatever they did back then he he wasn't that even in his justification he walked with God right so remember how we teach it here you you go through justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost in a baby form and then when you get in the pyramid what we're talking about now is right back to justification again right right then you're going to realize when we get to the Capstone there's another justification that that person really didn't do it that's where you got to realize that you didn't do it in the first place right you're Justified Justified means you didn't do it well now when you get born again you know you did it cuz it's real fresh on your mind then when you go through the statue of a perfect man it begins to weed out those things that you did and that you're still doing remember the sister's dream the trash was coming out the water was going in and then brother Brown talks about honey lying in the Box okay so we got Journey the journey we got a journey inside of a journey that's right right we do we have a journey inside of a journey our journey as a Christian as a even as a nominal Christian there's a journey that's right it's like brother John La Fontaine was was preaching yesterday which was wonderful brother Brown said there'll be a lot of people and I just read the quote not too long ago there'll be a lot of people in the tribulation because you didn't present the gospel to him your fault said that's what he said he said brother random said that yeah I just read it it's a quote I just read it the other day it's a direct quote he read it out of Revelation chapter 3 cuz that's what I was reading the other day and he said because of you and me he said you and me he said many will go through the tribulation cuz we didn't present the gospel to them you know what that means to me if we' have presented it to them they would have accepted it so how many times do we pass by our neighbor because we don't like our neighbor and I ain't talking about the guy that lives right beside of you right okay I'm talking about your community even here or even another church or or witnessing to people but remember cuz our life speaks louder than our words anytime okay so you have to look and see that that there's a journey inside of a journey though once you come into the message of the hour there's a journey there's a journey of a Christian We Must Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ Christ we must be justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost but remember let me just give you a little key Abram's Journey listen to me Abram's Journey was from 47 to 63 think about that a little bit Abram's Journey was from 47 to 63 brother Brown's message from 47 to 1963 that was Abram's message message It produced not and it did it produced Pentecostal It produced a wild child speaking in tongu shouting it brought the it brought justification and sanctification back in order remember that was a restoration everybody got that you got it then Abraham's Journey Abraham's Journey was for one thing and one thing only and that's what I'm going to speak on we have a mandate from God a commandment to be Abraham because Abraham is the only one that got a body change Abram's body wasn't changed Abraham's body was changed Abraham had to meet mezd in a different way than he met him in his other in his journey of a Christian Life you understand what I'm saying yes if you don't then I'll give you an hour or so teach the seals in 63 yes so 63 is when mzc the son of man that was God in human flesh that's that's when he came when sunset Mountain I believe opened the seals to the prophet well there was Abraham that was the start of Abraham's Journey right everybody get so you understand what I'm saying yes so we don't take Abram and Abraham as being from denominational World up we got to come and bring it to us right that that message from 47 to 63 did not produce a Rapture it just and I don't mean just as in being belittling it but it brought us back to a place to where we could become Abraham Abram's Journey brought him to where he could become Abraham okay everybody got that if Abram was if Abram wasn't right even in his folly and all the things he did wrong if he wasn't right he would have never met MDC on that road right right Abram said my Lord one God there's your first commandment now what's the next thing at I'm going to preach a sermon here what's the next thing Abraham said to MDC can you find 10 of my brothers righteous well he started with 50 that's right right so he thought about his Brethren there's your two Commandments there you go that's right that's good well Hallelujah y'all can sleep or not show up when Daddy asked me to preach cuz that's what probably I'll preach on but Abraham first thing he was worried about was his neighbor that's right that's right that's right he said God can you find and God said hey if I can find 50 righteous I'll save all of Sodom Abra Abraham he finally said man I don't know if we can get 50 he said how about 10 he said if I can find 10 I'll spare it but remember he couldn't but what was Abraham in in that part of his journey when he met MDC and he was solidified knowing that Sarah was going to be one that produced the child and that he was going to have that child now first thing he thought about was his brothers his brother his what lot wasn't his brother but he was his cousin or whatever nephew that was his neighbor that was his fellow brother that's what I was thinking about last night when brother John was preaching on on lot because remember lot lot was righteous the Bible said that that the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous Soul now if the Bible's wrong the Bible's wrong it's not brother Bram said he was a type of what the denominational believer that live close to the world right right but what's the first thing when AB I think about that last night what's the first first thing when Abraham and mzc was together and everything comes together and mezic says your commission is to have the child and you know what Abraham I believe he said well God you're going to have to change me back now he may not have said that verbally but in his mind he thought I can't produce it like I am so God's going to have to do something God had to come in 63 and break the seals to the prophet to break the Redemption of the body to give us a body chain but the first thing when Abraham became who he was he said oh that you could save my neighbor there's your first two Commandments right there because remember I'll read you a quote when we do this brother Brown said every son of the faith in the end will have to go through the same Journey as Abraham at the final end this is us every son of the faith has to go through the final Journey just like Abraham went through so Abraham is definitely a type of our justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost in the to be born again right but remember you and faith I mean his faith faith going that's where it started I'm just saying change you know yes well it started with faith to get born again and that same faith is going to change your body it's not a different Faith it's just more of the same Faith right all right because what what MDC did when when brother R brought those seals it brought an ability for us to take a body change there was no way we could do it until 63 even brother Bram thought he preached everything remember the spoken words being on seed he said Billy Graham s a seed or Robert S a seed and I've sld a seed where's the crop of it in other words I'm paraphrasing where's the crop of it holy spirit said pick up a pen and write brother Ram thought Malachi 4 had already been fulfilled but the Holy Spirit told him said as of yet Malachi 4 has not been fulfilled in other words you thought you might have preached the seals back in the 50s which you did in one service remember but now you got a commission you got a mandate because I've got a group of people that's going to bring that promised son that's why there in Psalms it's real fitting that we read that about bringing the son of man on the scene cuz that's the word made flesh that's not a Spirit come on people we're not dealing with it we had the Son of God the spirit down through the church ages we're out of the church ages that's right so the son of man's got to be the word and flesh in us that's right it was a word and flesh in in in Mar I mean in um Martin and Luther and all those people but it wasn't the fullness they didn't know how to get virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness it took a prophet to bring that together to build remember what zerubabel did because of zerubabel is a type of brother brandom zerubabel what' he do he swept off the foundation and built the building now that's what brother rown had to do he had to sweep off TI up the Loose Ends to build this great building the statue of a perfect man all right so it's all through the Bible I the people that don't get it I guess they just like brother John said they just ain't going to get it but uh if you'll see these two Commandments they do sum up everything cuz if you get one God right you got the Bible right okay you've got your new birth right you've got where you can talk about God being your father and not having a father and then a son and a holy ghost somewhere else you know you you you've come to the you come to the to the knowledge that there's nobody between you sure there's a man in Christ Jesus but he's God he's the father made manifest in the form of a son then you got the second commandment which we all got to come to now Abraham knew what was going on in Sodom right they were sodomites amen you know what sodomites do and they are they're they're they're they pretty viol but and men and men women and women where all that came from where that devil came from and lot sitting down there in the middle of it the two angels went down and they even tried to get the two angels out and and mess with them so that's pretty vile that's right but for Abraham to once he realized that the promise had come to him see AB Abram's Journey brought him up to a certain place and now he had a revelation that he's Abraham a father of many nations so there's Isaac is going to come so second thing he does first thing he does he says my Lord he knows there's one God then he looks down in s him and says well how about my neighbor can you save my neighbor see that's what we should do that's the Brotherly Love brotherly kindness that we should be talking about now let's go to Revelations 14 12 here is the patience of the Saints here are they that keep the Commandments of God in the faith of Jesus Christ see I brought them all together now we know that a lot of this is talking about Israel but remember in in type it's us right in type it's us here's the patience of the Saints here are they that keep the commandments so that's us we must keep the Ten Commandments amen we're the only people that can keep the Ten Commandments but if you'll not try to keep them in a list you'll do a lot better just take the first two that Jesus talked about you know Jesus didn't run through all the Commandments not at one time he he'd pick one or two here and there but he said the greatest of the greatest of The Commandments are these two so if Jesus said the greatest of The Commandments are these two then that's the two that we got to overcome by believe in one God and love your neighbors you love yourself and love each other okay so let's go to Revelations 22 14 I like this program but the only thing I don't like about it is is you can't like cut and paste and put it in a sermon form you have to do it by the folio views I wish you could do it with this but if you do I don't know how to do it so but I like it because it's real quick you can get where you're going and you do have little things over there that you can play with but I haven't played with them yet it's just good to read scripture with and it's got a lot of different versions let's see got American Standard Version it's got good news translation the book of the Bible New Testament new international Readers got a bunch it's like 40 different versions that you can read if you want to I like King James but you can read other versions to get what it says but Revelations 22:14 Watch what it says blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city blessed are they that do his his Commandments his statutes his order his charge his precept his prescribed Rule now remember it's not do and don't it's not dos and don'ts just like I told you about the man that goes to heaven it's not the paving of the parking lot or right or you know giving the you know you know giving the pastor something or giving me something or giving you each other something that's right that to me should be a it should be number one without strength attached you going to give somebody something give it to them it don't matter what they give you back you know what the Bible saying it don't matter it don't matter what the person you know well well I got a Christmas gift but you you didn't give him one you didn't give me you give me one but you didn't give him one or you didn't give you one give me one well I a give you one I ain't going to give you one okay I told her I give her the same thing I got her last year I may leave it the same color but it must be because remember agape love is unconditional love feel your love whatever you want to say about it it is conditional one more time F your love is conditional am all right huh if your husband does something good you love him a little more if he does bad you don't talk to him for three or four days that's conditional now that's not Jesus actually Jesus will talk to you when you're mad at him you know right so remember brother Bown explained it so well he said here's a goly love which we really can't understand cuz remember it's a pieace that passes all understanding so it's something we can't understand but remember if you get up that statute of a perfect man you going to understand it better than you did when you was a baby that's right amen so you come to brotherly kindness you're getting brother B say remember says you're now getting close to the kingdom that's right why the kingdom is the baptism of the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit the fullness of God not just the new birth that you received everybody understand that cuz we're going to talk about that where it says holy spirit right there okay that's not where you receive the new birth that don't say New Birth that says holy spirit you receive the New Birth the baptism of the Holy Spirit down there at Faith all right but up there at the top that was that honey that sealed everything in at the top you got to be sealed in and Satan sealed out because when you going through your journey honest to goodness Satan lives with you a lot more than God does in Hebrews we were told to read Hebrews and where it says without faith you can't please God and my faith is I'm not quite there with the change I mean it's weak um but where it says without faith is that talking about the faith in the New Birth you think yes because well without faith birth yes without faith it's impossible to please God you can't please God without having a new birth got to have the Holy Ghost so yeah that Faith but remember too you got to jump on up there and without that Holy Spirit without that Faith that's right it's impossible to please God in his fullness that's right in his fullness right you please God remember he said I am pleased to dwell in you right here at Faith just like he did Jesus on the River Jordan he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell not hear ye him but now when he comes to mount Transfiguration he says Hear You him brother Bram was an adopted son of God he had the mind of Christ amen more than anybody besides Jesus Christ on the face of the Earth amen so he was an adopted son of God then God said hear ye him in 1963 that's what happened when that sword came in his hand when he he met God out there met those angels I don't care what they got to say about it that was very important and it happened but he had a sword in the hand and he said that is the sword of the king that's the word all right so what he had to do he had to meet God in his fullness to bring us to a Rapture cuz we can't get in rapturing condition as Abram we mess up we produce a wild child we didn't produce a child but it was a wild child you and I we're wild we're we're the wild we we remember we were grafted in we were the Wild Olive Tree right that's Gentiles we were grafted in as the Wild Olive Tree so we've always been the wild child but God saw so much in us that we knew if he could get inside our soul he knew if he could meet Abraham one more Abram one more time he'd change him cuz his change started when he called him Abraham that's when his chain started when God gave you the new birth he started your change but now remember it he didn't say hear ye him until later on because remember as Abram Abram could not have taken his child on the mountain and done what he did I'm telling you he couldn't do it but as Abraham he walks up and prophesies hear ye him because Abraham said the boy and I will go and the boy and I will return now he was telling he was standing so God said hey I heard my son and whatever he says that's what's going to happen that's why you turn fear to Faith in Abram there was a lot of fear remember God put him to sleep he feared his death he feared hell he feared these things when you come up to Abraham let me tell you something when you meet God brother around so we got to meet him when you meet God which is God in human flesh which is US Pastor preacher evangelist all the five full ministry for the perfecting of the Saints once you meet that it changes you and your faith builds more because Abraham
