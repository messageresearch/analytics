you're going to win or not just read the bible we win devil loses every time it's kind of like the old tortoise and hair book you know you read the tortoise in the hair book guess who wins every time the tardis every time you keep reading that book you keep reading it over and over and guess what tortoise wins race every time every time doesn't change god doesn't change good to be in the house with the lord good to have each and every one of you with us today good good singing brother darty why'd you leave singing i mean what what'd you quit singing for stop that you need to be singing if you don't sing for us name for the lord okay but if you sing it for us then you sing it to the lord so that's okay but good good job girls and gentlemen that was really good we appreciate that that's one of the most favorite songs reason it is is is if it's not well you're sold today then you got a problem but that man that went through that song you ought to read it if he can stand in his day and lose his family under dwight moody's ministry which is good but not the ministry like we got the faith that we got but the faith he had he said though satan should buff it we think we have trials he lost his whole family all but his wife lost his whole family lost it lost a lot of money in chicago chicago fire i think he went bankrupt very wealthy man horatio spafford was but can you set in your study and say it is well with my soul it's well all is well i love that song all as well we've heard this message shalom and all is well there is a place of perfect rest behind the inner veil rest a little bride rest for all as well and man by way of announcement remember brother luis will be speaking for us wednesday night brother bob is still at brother richard wilson just remember them after we have communion and foot washing this afternoon we'll meet downstairs in the middle room those of you that are going to ohio we need to just get some pencil sharpening and what we need to bring and what time and all that we need to just get it together all right and also they remember the key three to be here with us on the seventh we are going to the camp meeting if anybody'd like to go we're our our car is full we don't have the ban anymore but if you'd like to go we're going on thursday and come back on friday we always like to support brother joe green and his efforts and uh there in ruth or rutherfordton north carolina so just remember that in your prayers listen to this the fundamental foundations of faith listen in 1955 the prophet of god says so i believe this with all my heart i believe that we're nearing the age that when people are going to recognize these things that we've had so much vain philosophy and so forth and teachings that ought not to be wow it's 1955. until it has set the human mind to a revolution of thinking on matters of this and that and taking away from the word of god listen to this as i've said faith doesn't come by fasting everybody believe brother brown was the prophet right all right got the right crowd faith doesn't come by praying reading a book all of that's good fasting praying and reading reading a book but faith comes by a settled something that's in the human heart that tells you just as sure as you come to this church tonight when you come home you told your wife that you'd be home after the service was over you do that unconsciously you must go out and get in your car and go home now you could not do it unless you have faith you could do it look how simple that is you'd never move from where you're sitting if you didn't have faith that you could raise up but you've done it so much and you just become so accustomed to those laws till it's a natural thing faith is a natural thing if you're a believer today your faith should be as common and natural as you getting in the car and turning the key and going to the house that's what the prophet said fasting's good praying is good and reading a book's good but faith comes from a subtle something that's in the human heart the soul not this thing the soul in your soul that's why it is well if it's not well with your soul today guess what it's all unsettled everything you got turmoil you got strife you got all the we got enough of that in the world but there's a subtle piece that a christian should have as uh brother spafford when he went across the river went across the ocean and the captain said right here is where your daughters met their death and that's when he penned no trials will come rest assurance is in control it is well it is well with my soul we think we have problems now you ain't have problems not when you've lost half of your family job had a problem job lost everything he had in just a few days but you know what he said i know my redeemer living so let's buy our heads dear lord thank you for the status you give us thank you for the wonderful music songs the worship father and we've done all those things and today lord we're going to hear from you just for a moment lord then we're going to institute communion and foot washing lord and we pray that you would be in all that that you would be in our service today lord as an active participant lord that you would go deep down into the heart and that you would strike the heart of man lord and change us lord we are coming to a body change but we have to be changed in our soul first there has to be a longing and a desire for the word of god before you can even help us and lord i pray that today that we will desire you not worry about this one or that one or the other who's looking at me and who don't care about me and who's not watching and who's watching and who's sitting beside me and who's not coming and who's coming and what kind of clothes they got on him no he said it as well with my soul i don't know about somebody else's but is he well with your soul tonight that's the question you need to ask in the name of the lord jesus amen in the beginning was the word and where was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us you know i was thinking this right here you see the statue of a perfect man that was in the flesh of god hello somebody the son of man's one that displayed those so the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and then brother brown says as we grow into the statue of perfect man guess what we are the word made flesh all right the son of man in the end time and the bride and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind we'll try to get to that this afternoon that you may prove now not god but you that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that's among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think you know the prophet of god told us that we're supposed to reverence the office right but we're no more than just servants we've got to understand that if you have an office in this church you're a servant you're not some hierarchy you're not some high falutin somebody we actually are servants to you what you desire today you're going to pull out of a servant what you desire your soul is going to pull the spirit that i was talking about those spirits you we can either get rid of the bad ones and then entertain the good ones the bible says sometimes we entertain what angels unaware why because we can't see any other dimension but we can see the effects of what's going on by what you think by what you do and that's what we're going to talk about confession and possession according as god has dealt every man the measure of faith so there is a measure of faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we be many are one body in christ and everyone remembers one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion or portion in other words the proportion of faith you've been given amen because you're not given i'm not giving brother dardy's portion he's given his portion he has a portion of god that he's got to fulfill that i can't fulfill and man brother brown said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's doing here get out of ephraim's cornfield if you're not supposed to raise corn get over in your wheat field stay out of ephraim's field ephraim grows corn we need to get over here and grow our wheat if that's what we're supposed to do instead of everybody wanting to be preachers and everybody wanting to be this nobody wants to be that just get your just getting your job just get in your office and stay there that's what god wants so you may be seeing the lord as blessing to the reading of the word and we're going to go through this pretty quick we've already been through the firs the stages i this morning as as i keep bringing this back and keep going over and over again it seems like there's more people getting more every time that we bring in justification and sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost there's little points or little things that you didn't cover before that you're covering now so i love god when because he knows we're human beings we're only going to get so much we're only going to get so much of the word of god and then the rest of it's going to fade away or like we said before we read a really good book well i read that book you know children are lightweight cement well i can kind of paraphrase it but i can't read it to you not from my i don't have a photographic memory neither do most of you have one either so we have to be told we have to be preached to we have to be shepherded we have to have the shepherd listen if a shepherd will get his sheep right to start with when they're little he's got a lot less problem with it when they get bigger so we thank god we had a good shepherd still got a good shepherd [Applause] his hook was soft mine may not be but if you've known how to take this the good one maybe you can deal with me for a little while but we good foundation folks good foundation you hear what brother ryan said remember a long time ago i told you i said brother adam said that teaching settles the church teaching if you'll take that teaching right it will you say well we'll just sit there and listen and we're right no there can be some amen and then some shouting and every once in a while we get happy and we go to screaming every once in a while but but you know what it's a deep settled feeling in your soul in your soul your soul is either faith or doubt there's no emotion it's faith or doubt the emotion is in the memories and conscious effects and imagination the spirit realm is where your emotion comes from and that emotion though is driven by what's inside that's why they that that horatio spafford he could out of his now his humanity he was a broken man his spirit was broke lost all of his income he was an insurance agent or something i think it was or something or an investment in chicago lost all that lost his family inside he probably was a broken man but way down deep inside i believe he had a new birth for his time he didn't know a prophet he come under dwight moody's message which is a reformer not a restorative restorer like we got now the prophet brought to restore all things dwight moody was under reformation which is fine and then he will be we'll see him again and we'll talk to him and he'll probably say i don't know how i wrote that song and the condition i was in i don't know he said but something something rose up that i don't even know why i did it but we do because he wrote one of the most beautiful songs that's ever been that's ever been sung he said i don't know why you know why it was for us it was the pull that we had in this end time to say it as well with my soul and then we talked this morning about sanctification how that the unclean spirit goes out walks in dry places we've been through that and remember i want you to understand about that new spirit that new spirit is something that people are going to have to be able to see you can't just say oh i got a new spirit not no when you get a new spirit look that spirit isn't god's spirit we know that that's your spirit but what he's doing he's softening up your spirit so that he can give you the holy spirit now if you'll come in those three stages you're fine but if you stop at number two you're not if you stop at sanctification think well i've got this great uh and most people i'm sorry but most people that's what you see because somewhere down the line they're gonna fall off because they have nothing to hold them they don't have a tie post they think they might have one but they don't have a typos and i'm sorry no and not everybody's gonna make it but i'm gonna preach like everybody's gonna make it now man because i it's not my it's not me to divide you all up it's god knows your heart and knowing your heart he knows what you're going to do but we'll get to it in a minute because of your confession if you confess you can't be healed you know what there's no way you could pour 55 gallons of jesus's own blood on top of your head and you will not get healed you've got to confess as sister freda did this morning and i've done in the past and you probably should practice it a little bit more to confess your faults i'll read it in the bible one to the other we don't have to air our dirty laundry but you need to confess privately if you need to confess to somebody or confess with a mediator whichever one you want to do but we need to get if we need to get things out of the way we're not going to move to the church without getting things out of the way amen so the baptism of my holy ghost is what seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth as we were talking about this morning obeying the truth what through the spirit you cannot have the truth without having the spirit of god pilate said what is truth well truth was standing in front of him but he rejected him right so what is true truth is the man that was standing in front of truth is the son of man ministry in the end time to me that is the truth being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible seed i'm just background just for a minute because i need to get through over to where i want to go now we know we're predestinated do you really believe that you're pre-destinated i mean you've got to really believe that god puts you in this hour for a reason either to what manifest the devil or to manifest god no twainers remember the man sitting on the fence the devil walks up and says hey buddy what are you doing he said well i'm on the fence i don't know if i want to you know go over here on in in in god's eating or or you know or satan's eating satan said that's fine so that's okay you can stay sitting there all you want to he said i own that fence i don't like fence sitters god don't like fence sitters because you know what you can fall over to one side but if you're far away from that fence you're always going if you fall you're still on god's ground if you fall off of a fence you might fall over on the devil's side but if you'll get far enough away from that fence i don't know why people want to play around the edge of the message i don't know why people want to play around the edge of christianity come to church when you want to yeah and guess what you're gonna walk in this church one day and ain't gonna be nobody here and that little voice is gonna say i told you and you never paid any attention i'm sorry that's the bible like i said this morning that's not my idea that's the bible the bible tells us and the prophet of god never in his life ever said sit at home he said if you've got the holy ghost you can't wait for them to how many of you cannot i can't wait till we get to wednesday service i'd like to have service every night i said when i tell y'all last night i said last night i would love if i could afford it to quit my job and just for seven days in a row just teach this message but not feasible because air conditioner's still got to run we need gas in the car and it's called life but you know what god will make a way what we can do because some of the people that asked about doing a series on message 101 just kind of drop down and why we have a message and why we believe that god sent a prophet and it's not just what we believe we need to do it in scripture because it's all scriptural it's not so i don't i don't well i do i understand this because it's the devil the devil can't stand it so he puts all these things in there well he was wrong here and he was this that he was this scent the other i really don't care he took me to god and listen he made it more simple for me to have faith because you go talk to somebody out in the world and you ask them what's going to happen in the next five years you ask 10 people you'll get 11 answers kind of like they said about beekeepers if you take put 10 beekeepers in a room and ask them one question you're going to get 11 answers because there's opinions the baptist said shake hands and the mess of the said will sprinkle you the presbyterian said well if you get caught in the liquor store that's okay you know baptist won't talk to you in the liquor store but but but do you see what i'm saying though they're not built on a foundation you and i know not to be caught in the liquor store hello we know that god had to send a prophet because of all this stuff that's going on in the world that the baptist says they're right and the method says they're right and the pentecostal said it's shouting and speaking in tongues and if you don't you ain't got it that's wrong but they build their faith on that but it's a false faith it's false there's no there's no foundation sure they had it at one time but when god got ready to build the building guess what happened they said nope this is it we like it right here the baptist said now once they always say we like you know we like it right here as long as saint susie you know made a profession one time 12 years later she passes away or 20 years later she's a good member of the church well she hadn't come to church in 20 years but we know the truth we have been taught and you know what it has ever been in here and every bit was in this book brother brown never changed this book he made it to where we could read it with confidence that we can open that book and know exactly what god said know exactly what justification is sanctification is the baptism of the holy ghost having faith going in a rapture not going through the tribulation hello somebody that ought to make you happy that we sitting here we've got the truth pilate what is truth this message of the hour this is truth and it's got to come through me and you it's got to come through a group of people that's why it's in the days of the voice of the seventh angel where's he sounding now he's sounding inside of me and you that voice is the voice of god to this generation and him also you trusted what after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the what purchased possession unto the praise of his glory then remember this morning we said god sent us a comforter not a reviler not someone with fear listen you ought to come into this church and be the most comfortable people listen to me in the world people go to venues now look what happened july the 4th in illinois in the middle of a parade this guy just opens fire he dresses up like a woman so he can't so you don't know who he is then he runs through the crowd and acts like somebody that's running away and he's got an ak-47 and he's what wounds 30 kills six i parade well i'm just going to say it i can understand shooting in bars happens all the time but i can't understand somebody in a in a fourth of july parade with kids there and god bless that little child i listen i'm still a human being but remember they found this little child that for a couple hours they kept watching this kid go back and forth and running through here and running here looking over here both of his parents had been killed right at the outset the first couple ones that were killed so they're laying dead in the street and the little boy is continuing going they think it's fireworks so he continues on through the crowd then ever you know all hell breaks loose chaos so the little boy's looking for his mom and daddy and they're both laying in the bushes passed away what a cruel cruel animal satan is amen i'm ready to conquer this place hey man i'm ready for something to come up and it's got to come up inside of you it can't come up in them they're out there running around going what i don't know maybe he was maybe he wasn't whipped when he was a kid maybe he was bullied when he was a kid like mom was talking about we were talking about the guy that shot all those kids in the class he went to the very classroom that he had problems with when he was a little kid somebody had done something to him and and they've traced it back to that and like i said this yesterday i said look video games you can let your kids play them if you want to but that is what is the inlet to your soul your eyes and they're sitting there playing in video games with the ak-47s and they're powerful they're killing people blood splattering everywhere and you know what they just hit reset and start over again well in your mind you can take a real ak-47 go and just hit reset and start over again see what the devil's doing but we've been sent a comforter thank god even in this vile world that we live in we've been sent a comforter look read your bible which is the holy ghost and the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you we were talking about the three and a half years of jesus's ministry and last night and that's all we got to work off of jesus preached three and a half years we've been preaching for over two thousand years on a three and a half year ministry how eternal is that that we've preached millions of sermons since since 80 30. oh for just three and a half years of one man god almighty and human flesh the son of man well guess what we're under that same ministry now a good short quick work is what god's gonna do in this place all right but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem judea samaria utter most parts of the earth we know that word is called dunamis which is strength or power and i like this one right here power for performing miracles and moral power moral power if the whole world would get the holy ghost we could do away with what we could do away with the police department everybody baptized with well guess what that's what we're going to live under when we get in the new city everybody's going to be born again everybody no malice no gown no hate listen we can't even fathom that because it so bombards us we'll get up in the morning i'll guarantee you we'll read in the paper or we'll look on the news and something awful is going to happen this afternoon so we're just used to that it's just bombarded but what about a day what about a day there's coming a day when no heartache shall come no more clouds in the sky no more tears to dim the eye all is what peace comforter peace forevermore on that happy golden shore you know what it's not it's not a fairytale story brother branham made it so real until you ought to be able to see your city now you ought to be able to see you're part of that city streets of gold you're not going to have to i'm going there you're not going to be where you got to hide something the bible says transparent gold so you can't hide your liquor bottles and you dope in glory won't be none because it'll be transparent gold you know brother john will walk by and sister alicia and they'll go hey brother sister junior we're sitting inside you know we're we're reading a message hey brother sister junior we're sitting inside you know we're we're reading a message book oh they gonna do away with a message and and no i don't think so how y'all doing good how are y'all ain't no bathroom so we don't gotta worry about now that y'all don't think like i do but i think man but to me that wells up something inside that that's what you've got already we gotta start letting that thing out start living what's inside of you i don't care whether it's good or bad if it's bad at least you'll realize it's bad and there's something you can do about it but if you try to think it's good we were talking last night you remember when the prophet of god went to pray for that woman that had been a sunday school teacher and she was dying remember and she said go get my pastor the pastor was there and she said you're a deceiver brother ryan said her real soul her real self raised up and said you deceive her you've told me wrong remember what the old preacher was doing give her a hypo well you know what a hypo is give her a needle give her a shot knock her out knock her out so she won't testify against me well there's no way enough that's going to knock him out her out to say you're a deceiver you deceived me all my life i don't listen you better hope you're not under a ministry like that because the baptist is that way the method is that way all denominations and some people in the message that think that they just call brother brown's name and god shows up no that ain't happening moral power and excellence of soul is it is it well with your soul it's not going to be well with your spirit for a while we're trying we're getting there we're going up the statue of perfect man but it better be you better have it settled in your soul that you got what you the goods as brother tom falbush would say you got the goods i'm not going to get there hold on he told us the evidence now this is the evidence of the holy ghost the evidence of the holy ghost is that we would have the teacher come and teach all truth but that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher now when an ins with the teacher was the one that writes the bible tell you something different than what the bible says but that's what the denominations are building their churches on you can cut your hair you don't have to worry about not wearing pants you can come to church when you want to some of y'all still believe that but you know what you ain't gonna answer to me you know what you're gonna answer to god if you don't come to church every service unless you got something to do some of y'all must have a lot of stuff to do i'm just telling you folks if you don't come to church you're not a christian period i'll look every one of you in the face you don't come to the church i don't have to be this one if you don't come to church every time the doors are open you are not born again boy it makes you good and quiet you should be prophet of god said you can't wait for them doors to open to come to church now listen i know i've had to work on sunday t's had to work different but look it ain't a ever sunday thing it ain't an ever sunday excuse you ought to know the difference if you got to go somewhere and you got to do something that's fine but i've always told you what kind of what are we doing and i know one brother said well you're making you're shining your light when you're out on the beach on sunday and you should be in church i don't know what kind of light you're shining because if i was a sinner that's why i think brother john i'm sorry i my oxygen got cut off when i was a kid i don't know something happened but mama dropped me on my head but there was nothing there so it didn't matter but i'm a sinner and i'm i'm sitting on the beach and donny comes walking up now he's stress fine he ain't got no shorts on but he comes and sits down beside me and you start talking about your church and about the lord you know what i'm gonna say why aren't you there it's the right one hello exactly listen i'm not talking about vacations but you know as well as i do you can take vacations and still be in church somewhere dad how many times have we went deer hunting in different places we hunt churches to go to we don't well some of y'all hide from this one so anyway i'm listen i'm not this is not my opinion this i'm trying to get us to go up that statue of perfect man but if our foundation is not right you can forget it like i said this morning don't worry about the seals don't worry about daniel seven of weeds don't worry about we're eating in the millennium don't worry about where we're going when there are 1260 days are happening down here get born again come to church read your bible if you'll do that first that teacher is promised to take you up that statue of perfect man but you got to get the divine nature of god first first let's what brother brown said what have faith and be born again not faith and know the opening of the seals if this is hitting you right between the eyes you need it you'll never say you didn't tell me brother dale's been screaming it for 45 years and i told him last night i said you know what brother branham preached so hard against denominations right he didn't destroy one of them not one said oh we'll just quit and go to start go to the tabernacle not one what brother brown in 1965 he said you pentecostals you get worse every year he was going to life tabernacle where he could preach very open he preached a lot of good sermons at life tabernacle because jack morris said preach what you want to preach but he said y'all get worse every year so for profit bringing the word of god bringing signs and wonders on the platform can't change you i sure can't god's going to have to change you and you're going to decide by your confession or your possession in just a minute if we ever get to it look those who were filled with the holy ghost heard the word received it and what live by it have i not told you anything outside the word of god i've not told you an opinion what's in the word of god so you know what you're not going to be judged by me you're going to be judged by this amen ruth can you sing excuses again excuse me we were talking about something downstairs and she started singing that song excuses excuses that's all i know she knows the rest of it for some reason those who do keep you awake those who did not have the spirit heard it only as carnal men put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin didn't continue on as christians the prophet said if you turn the message of the hour down whatever message that was you go off into sin in every age is the age of the holy ghost for the true believer i see in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it or revealed it to them and they were of that group that what heard the messenger oh we love that god sent us a prophet right we do i'm not trying to be sarcastic we love that god sent us a prophet but are we doing what he said and his message and took it and sometimes lived it it's not what he said and lived it and what is the message of the hour the bible being revealed not your idea and my idea matthew 11 verse 12 says and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violence take it by force this is not going to be spoons forks and knives it's swords it's a battle it's a battle to get up in the morning it's a battle it's about hey it's a battle go to work and then much less coming to church ii peter 1 verse 5 says simon peter servant apostle jesus christ what to them he's talking to a group of people to them that have obtained like precious faith what like them like peter y'all believe peter had the holy ghost listen it was written in the bible that peter got the holy ghost right on the day of pentecost 120 in the upper rim so he's got it so he's got this precious faith and he's telling us that we have obtained that same like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ and i kind of stopped right there because i want to um interject this right here but i say unto you that every idle word this is where was that this morning that men shall speak they shall give an account thereof on the day of judgment for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned i'm just reading you the bible look romans 10 verse 9 that thou shalt what confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and believe in your heart so there's two things believing and confession that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation now that word confessed in the greek i kind of condensed it a little bit and it made it a little bigger so you can see what it says confess is what freedom would you do today you admitted guilt read it you admitted yourself i can't i can't confess susan's guilt no way i don't know what it is but i sure know mine hello somebody i know mine i know where my faults are i know the thoughts i've had of all y'all to admit i'm just kidding i love everybody i love every one of you i think we got the greatest group when bob was talking about it luis is back here in the back they go off to different places and they look and see we think we got problems we good right we good we're all right confess because you know what it comes down to the word of god it's not your feelings or my feelings or whether i like brother dale or whether you like brother whether you like me or don't like me that doesn't matter the word of god is always true it will always what you go back to is go back to the word of god don't go back to a feeling don't go back to an emotion go back to the word of god say what does it say right here what does it say right here because remember god can't change his mind about his word if he loved you to begin with and you you would love him when you got here he never did not love you it's an eternal thought of god to admit or declare one's self-guilt of what one is accused of freedom you accused yourself because you know what you did i'm just you know you don't mind i use freda because she won't fall over some of y'all be going i know you knew we were talking yeah so do i know you're pretty good you know we were talking about being 14 years old she was my girlfriend at 14 years old 13 or 14. so anyway so we've known each other a long time but she i know i know kind of how she thinks that's kind of weird but um but like today i knew where she was coming from she wanted to get something out that was what there was there was you ever get that old feeling you they say stuck in your craw what your crawls your throat you get something stuck in your crawl what it won't come out and you know what it's going to do is choke you it's going to choke your christian life if you don't get rid of some of the stuff that you're doing me included that's that we're doing confess like i said before i said something about a brother and that stuck in my craw listen if a prophet of god come on somebody and you know where i'm going most of you do if a prophet of god going to lay hands now this is brother branham now oh i support reverend brother william branham the prophet of the end times everybody with me a man seventh church aged messenger teaching us perfection he goes to lay hands on a baby and god said stop right there i mean he's like and god said don't put what he say don't put your dirty hands on that child and brother branham instantly in his mind he knew what he'd done it was in there like i said frida didn't know what i'd done i didn't know what she done but it was in her mind what she did it was in brother brown's mind that what he done is he told a little white lie oh come on somebody he told a little white lion it wasn't really a lie he wasn't in the house he stepped outside of the house but he was there and they he had to go back what'd he do he said hold on a minute now what about a prophet coming into a home and you're you're you're trusting that he's gonna pray for your baby and it's gonna get well because he's the prophet he knows everything and he gets ready to do this and you know i mean it wasn't probably a booming voice god spoke to him in this in his heart and said don't put your hands on dirty hands on that baby so brother brown had to look at that mother and father and say hey hold on a minute i got to go make something right now what he had to do he didn't go outside and call on cell phones there wasn't any back then he had to get in his car and find that irs agent and apologize for lying what did he do he confessed but when he confessed that put him in a state of profession to a possession where he could come back and he said as soon as he laid his hands on the baby the baby got better now that's how god works folks i'm telling you that's why somebody quoted it the other day that that one unconfessed sin in this congregation one can make us bitterly fail it can stop the program of god one thing do we walk through that door and say god whatever it is number one bring it to my attention and number two give me time to get it right because see we're fixing to take communion and the bible says in the communion that if you have all in other words if there's something going on in your life and you partake of communion and you take of it wrong many are sick and weakly among you and many are dead may i quote the scripture many are asleep because we put so much on we put so much on taking communion but if you take it wrong it's killing you me and everybody but see this is the time of cleaning up getting everything out that's why i i talked to a brother one time and he said well we only take communion when we're ready i said well we would never take it this makes us get ready we know we gonna take it on the first of every month or the first sunday and the second one if we have visitors like we are today but it's that time where it just kind of rechecks us makes us confess makes us get right with god makes us try to do the right things come on people this ain't fooling around i knew listen when i was coming to this church as a young boy i knew not to take that communion because i wasn't a christian even though i may wanted to and my friend did and this one over here did i didn't take it because i knew if i did i was eating and drinking damnation to myself now folks if we let satan run around in our heads so much we'd never take it but when you confess it felt good that they didn't freedom felt good to get that out i felt good when i called that brother and said look brother i've said some bad things about you and i want to apologize he's all brother don't worry you're forgiven already but you know what that was for me it didn't matter i knew he would forgive me but that was for me to get that load off and then you know what i can move on with god i want to move on with god that's that pull i was talking about this morning you we talking about third pull that's the pull the pull is pulling us up that statue of a perfect man not a third pull when brother brown's got to come back and shoot a bear and and like chris was talking about you know put up a tent good grief come on we ought to be way beyond that brother brown said rapture and faith lies in the books and tapes i'll take what he said over your opinion any day of the week all right see he's gonna sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let him pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick watch this and the lord shall what raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven do you know if you come here and you pray get prayed for anointed with oil in the name of the lord the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he has commanded sins they'll be forgiven him confess your faults one to another pray one for another that you may be healed the official fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth a little it said much now let's look at this word possess the word possess means to acquire to get procure a thing for what one's self it's my possession when june is my possession i married her i take her i took her as my possession amen that's what it says to marry a wife and that's what god's done he's took a bride amen first thessalonians four verse four said that every one of you watch every one of you i like what paul says every one of you not certain parts of you every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor and i want you to hold that scripture because we're going to use it three or four thousand more times that is telling you about going up the statue of a perfect man that's not sanctification that the unclean spirit goes out and at baby form sanctification this is a daily sanctification you should know how to possess what knowledge not knowledge that you can do algebra no knowledge that what god says right possess his vessel in sanctification and honor manifestation of the spirit 1951 now you come to the altar realizing you're a sinner and you're sorry for your sins you repent of what you've done if you can stay there and cry for a week in and out and you can stay there and cry for a week in and out and it would never save you until you believe in your heart that you are saved is that right then you confess it now he can't do nothing for you until you confess it is that right for he is the high priest of what your confession he can do nothing you confess me before men i'll confess you before the father is that right what you say i've done down here for you that's what i say the father in other words he said father they did this down here i'm standing for them i'm standing for them now they stood for me down here that's what he's saying you get that young man he's talking to somebody the high priest of your confession now here is he's sitting here well to make intercession on my confession and i have a right to confess that he's done anything for me that's in the redemptive blessing there you are what was the redemptive blessing he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed is that right that's every believer's possession that's mine that's mine the 70th week of daniel we were talking about this last night but not this this quote but we were talking about the 70th week of daniel there is such a thing as the 70th week of daniel not half a week all right i said all i'll imagine when it shifted down that doesn't even do it justice brother branham before this i cut it short brother brown there was somebody came to him and said brother brown said the way you're talking there's not anybody gonna make it all right when you get the real pure in heart born again of the spirit remember this was the only church age that christ was put out of his own church of all of them we got a great confession but do we have a possession is what we're talking about is christ really in the church it'll be very much in the minority so do i brother see it more and more and with just a few gonna make it fear not little flock but you know what i'm one of them you guys say you're one of them i confess i'm one of them okay sarah just went that's good that to me that says a million words she went right here thank you sarah that was perfect i was watching them somebody the other day and they'd just done a funeral and the brother joel brown's mother i think passed away and they said right before she died this is right before she died since she raised up in a bed and said wow wow that's enough for me because some of them will probably set up in the bed and go oh no no no no no no but she said they said she looked up in the sky and said wow she was entering into another dimension and it was so happy all cause she could say was wow that's a sermon in itself stand up and just say wow wow when something's unfolded to you wow simon peter servant the apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained a lot precious faith with us through the righteousness of god to get back on our point here and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according to his divine power i love that word divine hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises thank god he's heaping upon us that by these you might be partaker of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence look add to your faith add to your faith not god's faith oh brother i'm reading the bible it says that to your faith i love what brother brown said one day he said you know what he said this is my eye because god gave it to me so this is my holy ghost because you know what god give it to me so this is what you're going to see your faith in action and we're going to talk about just for a minute renewing of the mind now faith i was i was thinking i thought well i'm going to look up a good definition for faith why in the world would i want to look up a good definition for faith when it's right here in front of our face why would i want to know what daniel webster said about faith the bible says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen that's a good enough definition for me for by the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear in other words we go and we we take and create a car we create a car because we what we get metal plastic rubber gears that's already here and we make it with it god took it from nothing and made he knows every star by name he knows the day he created it and it's been billions and billions of years ago he knows exactly where he put them he knew exactly where to put the moon amen you know that moon's the top of me and you do you know what happened in the fall or not in the fall but in during the flood remember the world was standing straight up now it's what 20 degrees or 18 degrees or how many degrees it wobbles that's why we got our spring summer fall and winter history lesson here or a science lesson here but what kept that thing from tilting on over what kept that world from going into chaos god had already put a moon right there and when that moon went around the earth it pulls it this way oh praise god when it goes over here it pulls it out of its chaos this way and it keeps it in orbit all the water in the ocean move about 20 feet one way and then when she goes around the back side goes back this way what is a moon on top of the bride without us on this earth this earth would fall apart it would tilt so far over to one side it would destroy this place but thank god he put a moon and the bible tells us in the end time that the moon is going to be as bright as the sun seven times through seven church ages he's put a bride here to keep this world standing straight up if not this world's gonna look when this thing is over and there's no bride on the earth we were talking about last night total chaos no new birth no holy ghost no blood nothing it's the wrath of god poured out on the world don't be here whatever you got to do don't be here young people nothing in this world is worth staying here for nothing by faith abel offered unto god it just thrills my soul when you can see what god did for me and you he obtained a witness he was righteous god testifying of his gift and by he being dead yet speaketh remember the bible talks about i mean uh his blood speaking abel's blood by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god translated him for what before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him so that's what i said before it it does that like brother brown said you can read books right here you can read books you can fast you can pray but without faith it's impossible to please god now we want to speak today on faith number five a different kind of faith there's different kinds remember we kind of hit on that the other sunday and we'll talk about it just a little bit now faith we're told in the bible faith cometh by hearing now you cannot be saved without faith and faith is something that you have to believe it's there that really nothing else will declare it's there but faith everybody reading that what an explanation by seventh grade kentucky kid scholars are going what what are you talking about now i'm trying to bring faith to you so she can be ready for this prayer line in the next few minutes now faith he that cometh to god must believe that he is what that he is god and it's impossible to please god without faith you cannot please him and if you say you believe god you have never seen him see so then you've got to go to faith go to believe it by faith and if you could see him it wouldn't be faith no more if jesus was standing right here you wouldn't have to have faith that jesus was standing right here amen that's why the bible talks about the end of our faith there will be an end of our faith when we get into the future home we will not need faith anymore why would we need faith all knowing all seeing i'm not talking about god i'm talking about you travel like a thought we won't have to have faith but you know what it's the faith foundation that we built down here down here's where you're building your building not up there i'm spitting all over the place why christ speak look moses go down there i'll be with you it anointed the faith that was in him and it anoints us when we see that we're living in the last days i like what brother chris was talking about you know brother man preached modern events made clear by prophecy but we see prophecy made clear by the events that are here amen find out because brother brown was prophesying folks we're not see it we're in it that's what i was telling those jamaicans years ago we were talking about the the vision that brother brown had of of the jamaicans running up the mountain and taking the gospel into jamaica well that's wonderful but until that happens it's just it's just a dream but once they stepped into that dream and the people literally started going and taking the message through jamaica they were fulfilling that prophecy and the vision that was seen so i drew you to step in the vision step in the vision of the word of god that the prophet of god brought in the end time that we can take a body change it anoints us when we see we're living in the last days to find out all these signs that we see being taking place now this is 19 what i say 1963 that's 60 years ago is that right yeah 60 60 years ago we're almost in 2023 60 years ago if fond of these signs that we see taking place that spoke of in the scripture would take place in the last days all the way from heaven to the political powers the nature of the people the demoralization of the world among the women and how they would do in the last days and how the men would do well tell me about it and how the churches would do he'll leave the churches out and how the nations would do it how god would do and we see it all laying right here on us oh it anoints our faith it moves us out in the great cycle that's what i'm talking about folks put your faith in this message there's none other there's none other than this message of the hour nothing will take you to a body change nothing will take you up the statue of perfect man except this message of the hour it moves us out into great cycles it separates us from other things of the world no matter how little we are or how much a minority we are how much we're laughed at made fun of don't make a bit of difference that's all we see it there's something within us we were predestinated to see this hour here god has spoken it's already happened we see it and how we thank god for this oh then it brings out your faith when you see these things happening here listen to the world it's chaos to us it's prophecy we know what's going to happen romans 12 verse 2 be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind why because everything you do right now is contrary if you didn't have the new birth you wouldn't want to be a church you'd want to be somewhere else right you sisters who put on a pair of pants because that's the world that's your old thinking why do these people leave the message most of them that leave the message they go right back out in the world it's like they do away with the bible while they're doing away with brother adam the bible's still true i don't care who's spoken through a dumb donkey but you can't go back and start cutting your hair wearing pants sisters if you turn this message down the bible still tells you not to do it good grief but their mind has not been renewed their mind is taking them back like some of y'all are falling off into sleep now and your mind is taking you to nowhere to land a nod leg up this is more important than your eyes being closed be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may what prove we're going to prove that god's right we're going to prove that william branham was the prophet of the end time you and i are going to prove it he's gone he can't say anything you and i are the voice that's going to keep this thing going that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god i like good positive words i don't like negative words for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of itself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god has dealt to every man the measure of faith what is that measure look a renewal that's to talk about your mind a renewal a renovation that rain man we've been getting some rain well i think we're going to start praying to stop now we prayed for it to come last week and it's here thank god we'll take it my little garden terrence's cows bless their heart they're down probably eating dirt because the grass don't grow if it doesn't get rain and listen you don't grow if you don't get rain have you ever stood out well i did the other day i was working in the garden and i thought i need to get back in the shelter and i'm like let it rain i was already soaked with sweat i said let it rain i said lord thank you just let it rain and boy it's a soothing just eh i just washed all the carrots of the world y'all ought to get a garden garden of eden hello somebody it was a garden i'll wake some of you up but a complete change for the worse oh it says the complete change for the banner that's what renew means renovate complete change for the better you know what i did some renovations brother gary krantz did something for us i didn't do a lot on the inside but i should have but we had a dumpster and he filled it up and so did we but you know what i thought i said you know what god that's exactly the way we should be god pull your dumpster in my yard and let me dump all my trash in it well this is your dumpster i've never heard anybody call a church a dumpster well guess what this is where you are what cast your cares dump your trash freda dumped her trash today right here in this building you know what that filter will not let it go out that door the holy ghost will not let that go out because brother collie read about not returning void right but it will accomplish what it said but i want to ask you a question do you believe it well you know sister freda would have never walked up here if she hadn't believed they'd done any good hello somebody that was faith i'm we with you sister we desperate with her hey who's not desperate we're all desperate with her this is a life this is life and she's part of us but we got a measure of faith all right so let's get to that just for a second an instrument for measuring a vessel for receiving and determining the quantity of things like i said before how many quarts is it from here to lula now wait a minute quartz of measurement right how many quarts is it from here to alcohol two quarts three quarts it's a measurement but it's not right but now if i say how many miles is it we go ah that's right but if we want to bake a cake how many miles of chocolate do we need to use to do not enough we went on a cruise to alaska one time and the only reason i don't think it didn't matter what the boat looked like she said they've got a chocolate bar and it's 24 7. i mean she's embarrassing me [Laughter] but we don't measure miles by chocolate so we don't measure we have a measure of faith that luther had a measure of faith but you know what that measure of faith is not ours luther's measure of faith was the just shall live by faith he could smoke a pipe drink a beer and be he's a german he so he could do that all right and the god said all right live by the just shall live by faith i'm going to anoint that and that's yours all right but now me and you are over here in the age of full restoration not not reformation we're in restoration so this faith is not done away with it's just brought over and what enhanced or made more a graduated staff for measure what is measuring to do it measures how big or how long or how high the height the depth the length and the breath you can't count it when you talk about god's love but you have a measure of faith brother brown said statue of perfect man he says have faith and be born again that's laying the foundation june 1 jude 1 verse 3 beloved now we're going to talk about a measure of faith here beloved when i give all diligence to write unto you the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you now he's writing unto people christians and they exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints so somewhere it got lost somewhere got lost so there's a lost faith that's why we had to have the prophet of god to bring that faith of the fathers take us back to that faith of the fathers so that we can build this pyramid in the end time amen contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints it got lost down to the church ages like i read to you before man's ideas got involved denominations got involved divisions got involved god never intended for that for there are certain men well that's the problem i brought i'm not going to read this quote but i'm going to paraphrase it for you brother brown you know he always said his worst enemies were preachers and that's what he was telling him he said i sit around with a bunch of preachers you know what he said let me tell you what brother brown said if i can find i'd read it real quick but brother ryan said i'd rather be sitting at a table with witch doctors than to be sitting with the preachers i was sitting with the other day put in witch doctors and you'll see that's exactly what he said i'd rather be sitting with a table with witch doctors than to sit with preachers that i sat with the other day well that made you quiet good you ought to think about that that's how bad that spirit is if it's not right it's an evil witch doctor spirit if it's not truth but we must earnestly contend for the faith which is one delivered to the saints guess what that's what brother branham brought us back to he brought us back to that faith now what are you going to do about it for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god in our lord jesus christ so there was a lost faith then we talked a couple of sundays ago about faith for the time that's needed the loyal woman that had the blood issue she had faith for the time the prophet of god said remember the she had a blood issue that she her female trouble that she couldn't stop bleeding but look at if you'll just you say well that's that's that's pretty bad but you know what she couldn't do nothing she couldn't go into her husband because she was on her period come on people she couldn't go in the congregation for 12 years she was in bad shape everywhere she sat down was unclean according to the old testament read your bible she was unclean everywhere she went she was tired of it how many of us are tired of being unclean that's our problem we carry too much of this junk with us well i'm gonna preach a little bit today if that's okay your genuine faith will do it right there your genuine faith will make it so real to you look at that little woman with a blood issue she said if i can only touch the border of his garment i'll be made well and as soon as she did it she said she felt within herself that her blood issue had stopped she actually believed it she actually jumped up and down no she actually she believed it when she touched it to prove that it stopped jesus turned and said who touched me that's perfect faith and that same perfect faith tonight he brought it up 2 000 years that perfect faith tonight will touch jesus christ just as it did then that woman came with a perfect faith for that time notice now another talking about perfect faith 1963 we'll close here in just a second perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect faith masters all circumstances no matter what it is it masters it when you believe anything do anything and you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstance is that don't have one thing to do with it see it masters that circumstance if it's in a room of sickness and the lord reveals that this certain thing is going to happen you just speak it and go on oh don't uh don't don't don't no don't ask any questions don't ask any questions it masters all circumstances paul one day was on a was on a boat with clothes right here paul was on a boat god told him he had to go to rome remember he said i got to go to rome you remember they tried to stop him but he said i must go to the room god wants me to go to rome all right god said so keep that in your heart so here's paul he gets on a boat he gets in the boat and they go down through there to cyprus or wherever it is and the seas are just all over the place remember the story season is all over the place they start dumping cargo so if they start dumping cargo they ain't a lot of food left they ain't a lot of good water left when they start dumping cargo to lighten the load to get the boat up above the waves everybody with me paul's on the boat with 140 i believe people are 120 something people you're reading your bible you read the specifics i'm just going to tell you the story all right so they lightened the load and it still the bible says was contrary the wind was contrary in other words it was not blowing them to land it was blowing them out so they're getting together and they said look we're going to let down the boats and we're going to get off this ship as many as we can get off the ship paul said stop come on somebody faith masters all circumstances paul jumped up and said stop there was an angel came there was an angel came to me last night and said if you'll stay on this boat now how contrary is that to your carnal mind get off the boat it's sinking they were sailors they knew the water they knew the waves they knew how much that luke you're getting so big good grief what a young man good looking kid but they said this boat's not gonna make it paul said if you'll stay on this boat now god told me the boat was gonna be destroyed but he said if you'll stay on this boat every life not one life will be lost so they must have believed paul faith masters all circumstances now that's not the end of the story because remember the boat breaks apart and they're actually we watched there was a movie about that one time and they're they're on the you know they're they're hanging on pieces of the ship and they're finally making it to shore well there's a group of natives there so when paul comes up he must be a pretty personable guy because they look at paul and say well he must be a demon read the bible he must be a demon because he must have done something wrong he must have been a murderer he must have been a killer because because the gods they believe in gods the gods have broken up their ship and if i was paul i'd be going but nobody's dead i said nobody die the angel told me nobody would die just like the angel came to brother rama stood beside him in the cave and said get the people to believe who you are get to believe you and even cancer won't stand in your way amen paul had an angel brother branham had an angel you got one it's just hard to communicate with him hey man so anyway so paul they're saying well man this guy must have really messed up he's the head of this gang and they're all their boats destroyed they're stuck on this island there's no way for them to get off the gods must be really against them must be a murderer i think the bible says so paul goes together in wood to build a fire must have been pretty cold so he starts gathering wood and they're all watching him because he's a murderer he's got a devil on him all right everybody with me and this black mamba the bible didn't say it bit him it said it latched on his hand now to be bit and fall off is not so bad but when even with a b or anything if something latches on to you they're just shooting poison just as fast as they can shoot in your body because they're going through those hypodermic needles that are called teeth fangs said it latched onto paul's hand the bible said paul shook it off and kept getting wood and what did the natives say they turned their whole perspective around and said he must be a god so he went from being a devil to being god but you know what his faith when that poison that would have killed him in a couple of minutes went up his arm faith mastered that circumstance and changed it into nothing but maybe water it probably changed it into blood but it mastered his circumstance because he knew he had to go to rome he couldn't die on that island when you and i realize we can't die unless god's finished with us there's no way look at daniel daniel in the lion's den listen they didn't put him down there with a bunch of kittens amen and to be truthful they probably didn't feed those lives for about two or three days so they were real hungry and you know what they had eat human flesh before amen so they're letting daniel down and they're going that one's mine no that one's mine now there's enough for both of us we'll just tear him apart and eat him up when that saints foot hit the ground the bible told daniel though he was going to come out of captivity come on people he took the promise of god he said two more years i'm leaving this place right two more years i've been in captivity 68 years i got two more years and god promised me god said so that i'm gonna get out of here these lines have nothing nothing to bring so the faith that went with daniel when his feet hit the ground they were going and knowing daniel he probably sat down right beside of them and he just if i was in there i'd say look you can have the next guy but you're not getting me faith in the old testament mastered the lines and shut their mouth shut them up how many lines do you want shut up in your life listen we're in a lion's den every day when we walk out in that world there's something or somebody wanting to eat us up all the time but when faith masters that circumstance see it masters all all circumstances you know why because god said so god gave paul a promise listen god gave david a promise you know what david did david walked out he didn't worry about he he didn't go kinda like joshua joshua goes up to the city of walls of jericho and joshua being a a a warrior he probably said all right that thing's gonna remember they could run chariot races across it it had to be 70 or 80 feet thick and probably 40 or 50 feet high because people built their houses on the side of this thing but now did joshua go now let me calculate it's going to take 2 000 pounds of dynamite and it's going to take us born a hole right through here god said walk around the thing for seven times and on your seventh time shout joshua didn't call it didn't get caught up in measurements he didn't get caught up in all the stones and the bricks and the rebar and all the different things he looked past that he looked at the promise of god and faith met that circumstance you know what when they blew that trumpet brother john disappeared in the ground and they just walked right over how many of you want to do that we want faith to master our circumstances david you gonna die son no i'm not i had a prophet i had a prophet prophesy over me and he poured oil on my head and he said i was going to be king of israel and even a giant don't care how big he is how many brothers he's got until i sit on that throne i can't die faith mastered that circumstance let's have faith the challenges of life the challenges of things that we do every day faith will master those circumstances if you'll let them do it what about from here to here is only just a foot or two and that poison as soon as it goes in boom i mean three minutes i think black mama three minutes you're dead three minutes cut your oxygen off you your lungs paralyzed um you've seen poison before i guess um that works in your body but something took over that he didn't need to go to a pharmacy he just said i got to go to wrong because god said so let's stand our feet coach god said so when we can realize that we're the bride of jesus christ in the end time and god said will not die somebody will come to perfection someone will come to the statue of a perfect man someone will destroy death that has been reigning for at least six thousand years something that our mind cannot comprehend but god said i renew it i'll put something in there that the world don't have i'll put faith the sixth sense in you and you'll be like daniel you'll be like paul you'll be like david like i said before god does not deal in numbers never has never will he can take one guy moses and destroy a nation as big as the united states listen russia's built up for years nuclear bombs and and millions of of of soldiers just to beat the united states god sent one man moses and he destroyed a nation the size of the united states our god is a wonderful god amen if you have a need just for a moment oh if not we're going to continue right into the communion and foot washing god bless you we love you we love the lord thank you all for coming i hope that we our faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen listen have faith in the word of god don't put your faith in your car put your faith in politics and put your faith put your faith in god paul put his faith put his faith in god because god said so god told him he's going to rome so he said no i can't die till i go to rome well you and i we're the bride of jesus christ somebody's going to come to body change somebody's going to wipe death off of their sleeve faith masters all circumstances the prophet of god was never nervous when he had a prayer line he was never nervous when he took those demons all in control i'm sure the demons were just hopping back and forth in that other dimension didn't bother him because faith he got met with an angel and the angel gave him a commission he said they'll nothing stand before you and he said not even cancer so i mean he took it all not even cancer if you get the people to believe you and have faith so let's bow our heads just for a minute dear lord thank you for this day that you give us thank you for lord your people this is the pride of heaven but we're on earth now and lord i pray that you would be with each one of us lord may we confess until we can possess confess our faults one to the other lord i want to be possessed i want to be possessed by the almighty the world is possessed by demons and all and the chief devil himself but father many years ago you cleared that out of my soul and you put yourself in there lord now i pray that that will work itself out and the people here lord it will work itself out in them too lord that it'll work its way out like that little cocoon a little worm there's a butterfly in there somewhere it's just got to work its way out lord just be with us and sanctify us lord for this journey that we're on be with the ones that are sick lord even if we've seen people healed taking communion lord because it's what it's an is something that you promised you told us we'll read it here in the scripture that if we eat bad it's going to give us bad stuff but if we eat good then we have good lord just sanctify us and keep us blessed us in jesus name amen the bible says for i have received of the lord that which i also delivered unto you that the same night the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoe the door or show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and sow let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you wow and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world thank god that's our promise we'll not be condemned with the world the world's going to be destroyed you're not wherefore my brother when you come together to eat terry one for another and if any man hunger lady meet at home and that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will i set an order when i come let's just have a few moments of silent prayer the prophet said pray for you pastor the pastor pray for you ask forgiveness if you need forgiveness confess if you need to confess but let's get this out of the way because we want to be pure in god i want to be able to take communion listen when i wasn't a christian i i was afraid of taking communion because i knew what it did to me but now the bible tells us to come boldly to the throne of grace take this communion if you have ought against somebody god knows if you're going to straighten it out or not if you straighten it out then go ahead and take communion if you don't then you're going to suffer the condemnation amen so let's power his lord we ask your blessings in jesus name amen the bible said he took bread and blessed it dear heavenly father again we come to this day lord that this bread lord was made with holy hands made with water and flower nothing added to it lord and that's the way you are there was nothing added to you father lord i pray that you would bless each one that partakes of this communion father and sanctify us in jesus name amen every time i do this i know probably terence is too young we used to sit on the countertop up there that house on top of the hill and mom and daddy would bring out the bread it'd be in the freezer in a box a little square away for about like that what am i about that big white as a sheet but it froze it was held over this is not going to be held over you know what i'm going to do with this one what's over what's over with this when there's what brother donnie gets all that up off the ground i'm going to take it home and i'm going to take a blow torch and i'm going to burn it to a crisp where nothing can eat it or even want to eat it it stinks actually gets all in your clothes but you know what we're doing that because we're not holding over we're getting new revelation the next time we're getting new revelation the next day we're not going to live off of old bread we're living off the living word of god so this will all be burnt to a crisp tonight before the day break comes we'll take a torch and just blow this to pieces and it'll be just a charred mess but you know what right now pretty good for you amen so this is an institution that god told us to do he told us to do this so so why are we going wrong we're not going wrong by doing it we're going wrong by not doing it amen i just want to let you know that's what we do i mean we don't hold this over we burn it i'll burn it every night when we have communion dear heavenly father lord this wine has been made by holy hands and i pray now father that it will be consumed lord and and we can when we close our eyes lord we can see you standing that night in front of the disciples and saying eat this bread and drink this cup because it shows the lord death until he comes lord we know you came and i know some people are not taking communion because they said jesus came in 1963 but that's not what the bible said the bible says to take this until you come and i believe in a physical coming here not to the earth but a coming and a bride and then we meet you in the air but until then lord we're going to continue to take communion we're going to continue to be washed by the water of the word continue to take the bread and and the cup lord and drink it and not drink an unworthily father just bless the people as they partake in jesus name amen come morning i'll wall by the river i'll rest near the evergreen tree i'll carry my cross there's a cross you gotta bear the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes i'm despised oh the world hates us satan really hates us and i question oh father how long then i take one more look at mount calvary and what does it do it renews my mind it gives me the strength to go on good morning i'll walk the prophet of god said sometime between six and nine in the morning when the rapture takes place we're going home we're gonna go to a place with the greenest grass you've ever seen in your life the brightest day you've ever seen in your life no clouds in the sky no sorrow no hard days and i know we're doing it now we're having heartaches and sorrow but the bible says those who endure to the end endure endure sickness endure heartache endure trouble trials your family turns against you the world turns against you you your neighbors your co-workers can't understand you you know why because your mind's not like theirs it used to be i hope they see a difference now if not you need to renew your mind because out of the heart proceedeth all things but it has to go through here and come out you gotta think it before you say it let's start thinking on these things we've talked about last night brother dale always said that for years for those of y'all that that weren't here in the early stages in the 90s and 2000s he would always say think on these things amen and then brother louise picked it up and preached sermon on him think well think about what i said today you're just going to say well it was a good sermon and go home and here's life build on it please i hope hope it didn't sweat for nothing i usually try not to do that but you just get happy when you start talking about faith because faith is the substance of things hoped for evidence of things not seen if you can see it i can see this water bottle i don't have faith that that water bottle is there but like brother adam said it was so simple he said he said now i may have he said i may have left my pocket knife on the on the dresser in the motel room he said but i'm going to believe it's in my pocket and he reached down his pocket and pulled it out now whether it was there or not i don't know but he said he might have left it left it there that's how simple faith is simply believing what that god said so paul how did you survive that snake bite god said so god said i was going to rome and i hadn't gotten to rome yet david how'd you kill that kill goliath god said so he said i was going to be a king and i wasn't a king yet so i'm going to believe what god said i don't believe what my anointing prophet told me let's partake thank you lord the supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of judah says carrot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and he was come from god and he went to god he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel wow what about a servant this man created the ground in nelton created the cloth that he used created the water that he used created the people that were standing in front of him and he washed their feet and ain't like now jerusalem was pretty muddy and pretty uh nasty with all the stuff you know brother brown talks about that when he talks about washing jesus's feet you know when the lady with her hair said oh said there was donkeys and all kind of things walking you're walking right over it right through it that's not now but we still wash each other's feet jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and he was come from god and went to god he rises from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poureth water into a base and then began to wash the disciples feed and wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to simon peter and peter said unto him lord dost thou wash my feet jesus said what i do they'll know it's not now but you will when i come back as the comforter and i go inside of you you're going to understand what i said what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter peter said unto him thou shalt never wash my feet well there's peter with he's fixing to stick his foot in his mouth in just a second because jesus answered and said if i wash thee not you don't have no part with me peter had enough sense to go sorry lord don't just wash my feet wash my hands and my head just give me a total washing and jesus said no he that washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean ever with and you are not all clean for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you're not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garment was set down again he said unto them know you what i have done unto you now that's a question mark he's asking him do you not know what i've done unto you if i then you call me mastering lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for i have given you an example that you should do as i have done to you verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he sent the he that sent him if you know these things happy smile with me happy are you if you do them if you wash feet begrudgingly you need to go get born again i love brother tom ernest you know his wife was here last wednesday night brother tom every time he washed my feet he kneeled down he looked at me and he said brother it's an honor to wash your feet any minute he didn't just wash his feet because he had to he didn't wash my feet because he had to he washed it because he believed what the scripture says that you'll be happy if you do it so today if you want to get happy go wash somebody's feet let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day that you give us thank you for the word that we've heard lord i pray that it sink deep in our heart lord i pray that the faith that we have will master all circumstances everything that we go through we need to turn back look back have faith in the word of god have faith in the prophet of god that sent us 1100 sermons he preached his heart out he he he absolutely wore his body out he he absolutely uh took himself away from his family to have a regular normal life to travel around the world seven times together abroad in the end time i thank you for him lord but i thank you more because you gave your life you died for my sins so that william branham could tell me about it and i thank you for that lord i thank you for the the quality of life that you give us and i pray that you give us that more under the word of god of the end time not just material wealth but wealth in the word of god we pray lord that you would take care of us now as we dismiss be with us and take care of us be with brother luis on wednesday night as he come and ministers to us be brother bob as he's on his way back home probably close to about now that you'll be with him and touch him father bring us all back together in one lord and with this coming up in a couple weeks we pray that you'd be with us lord and sanctify us for this journey in jesus name amen sisters you can go downstairs you
