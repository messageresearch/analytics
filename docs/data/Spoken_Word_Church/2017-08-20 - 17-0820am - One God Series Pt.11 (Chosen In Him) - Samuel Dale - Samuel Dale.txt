look at sheet rocks up and everything ready for painting maybe we'll get it pretty quick John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shining in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there's no way that darkness can comprehend God's Word it has to be revealed there's no way I hope you're catching on to some of that part of it by now of what we're trying to making it so hard and straight ok visions 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus not written to the world written to Christians about Christians grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ this it be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ and here's what we're going to be dealing with according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now I want to try I didn't give them anything to pull up on the screens any quotes because we may read a lot but I I want to just try to get a point to you I want to make sure you understand what I'm talking about the way I'm trying to express things and what I believe because there's so much controversy among the believers of the message of the hour and it's are talking about you know one group believes you were coming to the world with eternal life you know another one believes you come with this seed another group believes you come with this and there's just all kind of things and you know I've always just been honest and straight I'll get back to this and the message in a minute see people would actually believe that the new birth would just be God opening your understanding of the word well I hope you were following me there Wednesday when we went through talking about how that Moses is understanding was open all the prophets understandings were open to them you know the things that you know was made known to them great wonderful thing but none of that gave them eternal life so you can hold the Bible says you can actually know all the mysteries now that's that's something they need to know the entire Bible all the mystery that's the scripture but how not Christ our love which is expressing these dark then you're sounding brass and tinkling cymbal so you can understand all the things and all like that and still not have eternal life and sees in you and how the thought people would say well all I need is the new birth is all I need is just to have an understanding I come into this message so I know I'm born again well the devil believes it so where's here I don't like you calling me the devil I didn't call you the devil you called your own self that's your situation you're the one that putting yourself in the category not me I'm trying to be honest and straight all right and see then to see eternal life you know then we need to understand the scriptures and the way to brain if the new birth is just an opening of your understanding as I said my didn't Moses and him get it why didn't a little woman at the whales we're bringing out Wednesday she's over in the park close to the New Testament right what about the disciples in Luke that had remember the ones on the road to Emmaus and Jesus walking with him he opened their understanding to the scriptures I was after his resurrection why didn't they get eternal life wanted to have to go wait in the upper room so they go running back and remember in Luke and they come back to the disciples then Jesus appears to him and opens their understanding of the scriptures if all we need is a new birth is to get our understanding open look what you're saying the intellectual people would have it over the rest of us because it's doing yeah but but we are I believe that I believe the new birth is the opening of the word yes siree that's the way I've always told it it is the opening of the word but it's not just opening like parts that we can understand there's things we can follow that was why I was trying Wednesday night to express that God in his mind so everything that would ever be in this world right but that's where we link back to in our predestination we go back there and stop but I don't want to be just something he thought of I want to be a part of the very thinker because that's Paul it's the mind that was in Christ being you right see I want to be a part of the very one that was doing the thinking that's the only way you can have eternal life the eternal life is a person it's the person of Jesus Christ that's why he had to die to release that life to be able to come back on us if not you're just dealing with head knowledge you see yeah but my understandings been open I hope you followed me Wednesday and following me now the entire Old Testament people all of those prophets their understanding was open but it never gave them eternal life if he did why did Jesus have to come and die what would be the purpose of the death of Christ I thought the purpose was was to release that one that was within him so that one that was within him could come back into me and you and give us a new birth I mean that's what I thought if I missed it I'm sorry see then it's not just an intellectual understanding I've read six books and listen to two tapes in one day you want to talk about intellectual understanding it but the colleague can verify sit down her a lot of nights and read half the night sitting right there where he's that go to had a wonderful job the good emotion everything but I done my job or not but what's the point I'm talking about he's trying to get you and I to realize what it means the Prophet said it like that the greatest thing in the world to you is to be born again the greatest thing of all lot you can think about your money you can think about all of your doings or your popularity's or or everything else you can think it's worth nothing cuz it'll end but if you've received eternal life now then is where people gets confused you know which brother Adam here safe you come into world with eternal life look at higher we come in the world eternal life but you're not reading the rest of the book you're not reading the rest of the place if you have eternal life today the eternal life you have all ways was eternal is that sensible do we need a great big light bulb to open up open up our understandings of that are just simple plain language if you have the new birth that new birth is eternal life because it's the birth of the word that you've taken in hell and God come in quick and it that's why I argue with those about that where I come with a seed and praise God we believe in coming with a seed right but a seed without moisture is no good because that's head knowledge moisture is coming upon the word brings you to a revelation making you a child of God yes what brother Dale I always was what a part about you always was that's all I've ever asked is your body's your spiritus your soul which part of you comes esta fun which part of you was always was eternal but you're not taking sensibly listening you're just making quotes to what you want sure if you have eternal life that eternal life always was eternal but there was a time you didn't have it he said no no I come here with it what was it that I know the doctrines that went along with the message to souls God gave you a soul the devil gave you your soul all you had to do is kill the one the devil gave you God's always was eternal well not worse the Newburgh Jesus Christ out in vain well he had to die to release that light that that life could come back in you and I to give us eternal life now come over then the eternal lives you got always was eternal what they're trying to say Wednesday one but a brother said if we're a part of God you realize any but one way to be a part of God that's to take his life into you and I as an uber not to have a knowledge of something knowledge puffeth up what the scripture says they sure will do that a lot right but revelation will humble us but listen church what I've tried to explain eternal life is a person it is the person of Jesus Christ coming and living in you by the new birth and makes your soul eternal so then when the Prophet is saying you always love eternal if you wasn't born don't know certain day that's fine called a new birth that's no start because just remember all it is the new birth when you receive it is the imparting of the life that he had before the world ever begun waiting on you to get here to receive it is that sensible see then why can't we take all of the things of the Prophet put it together and come out with an understanding is it to where we can see that that new birth is the most important thing in this world because if we don't have the new birth we do not have eternal life and we were emphasized over and over going through it to try to brand that look at those Old Testament Saints and the great things that was happening in their lives until the very the very fact that Egypt was plagued by the voice of Moses that he'd called for something it would come but yet he never had eternal life because Jesus Christ had not come and died so the only way you can have eternal life is to have the life of Christ that was bottled within that human element we call Jesus the body and then it was released at Calvary to where it could come back up on us to give our soul eternal life see that way then everything is hinging upon not being you is hinging upon him so we registered aren't Ephesians that said that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world he just older disciples that I knew you ordained you and all before the foundation of the world the book of the life of the Lamb that was slain revelations art what is it um 13 8 it was before the foundation of the world well your true and it sounds like this that you're confused and you're putting something back here but you don't know how to put it over here what I don't understand why you don't understand that's the best that I can say it I don't understand how you can say you come with eternal lot or could ever think about coming into the world with eternal life now according to my Bible and if it's changed and you tell me according to the way the Bible states it God won't dwell in an unclean vessel that right why do you got to go through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost to have eternal life if it's just a knowledge that you receive and if you have to go through that to receive it then some facts are saying that you don't have it I can't talk about whimsy we talked about redeemed write the word redeemed means to go back where you come from right well you know what if that's right I'm asking you if that's right then that means we fail from somewhere if you come with eternal eyewall you need redeeming I thought eternal I was a redemption right I thought that was redemption was to receive the life of Christ yes but we've got so great revelaed 'add see we got all of this great stuff and Revelator too we no longer have to to go back I'm talking about the same things that have been taught by every religion in the world and basically every religion does talk about what you must be born again they may have different ways of seeing it and things that we wouldn't agree with but at least they talked about it with the people of this message is a lot higher here's I see it that's my new birth I believe this message remember what we talked about Wednesday what did your prophet say the evidence of the Holy Ghost he didn't say whether or not you believe the message that's what we put on it what does it say what the prophets saying he said the Lord straightened him out on a vision and showed him the evidence of the holy ghost was one whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word but what you needed evidence before you get a burn the evidence comes after the bird right I mean it's a baby here you know that you couldn't they didn't cry you didn't hear them in the womb crying the mama huh y'all hurry up get me out of here not exactly what you see that's what I'm trying to get us to see this reason I set out others won't use the notes I'll just go with it there's a lot of lanyard if I needed my quota to see if you're a part of God then the only thing that could ever be a part of God would be the very nature and manifestation our person of himself how was it that Jesus was God I thought God Himself the great eternal that we've been preaching about condescended downward until he made in a flesh to come and live in and that that would be Almighty God the body would be a creation the acts of God's Word creating but the soul is a very soul of Almighty God the spirit was a very spirit of Almighty God placed in a man then the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead of course there's a lot of people now don't believe he was God until this happened or that happened or that happened with we've got time to argue folks I've been doing this 40 something years and all we've been doing is Argan we've been running around and around Horeb it's about time to believe what was what's been talk to us and get out of our own little sails and say thank you lord he's been that way if you have eternal life had to be a time that you received right so if you had a time to receive it that means you didn't have it start with if you if it come all the way down and and then all you need is a knowledge that's what I tried to tell those two sold people they were telling me about how that this over here said we just need to kill that I said why don't we just kill the individual you know if all you needed to destroy this soul is to kill that soul I said what if she did kill the individual he automatically goes to heaven them that don't come out too good does it see everybody's trying to bypass the simple simplicity of the new world and that was Jesus his first message was not the Nicodemus Nicodemus you realized who you are well he take him all the way through his lineages and everything I don't see he didn't say do you realize who you are in your eternal I just come to tell you your eternal then what kind of a gospel would that be see but the new birth is to receive the very person of Jesus Christ within you that is eternal life and if that's eternal life the eternal I've always loved eternal not you if we're going to get to that code when when it happened man fell from the original plan of God and it not been for the fall you could argue about your thoughts and ideas but you got admitted to fall and I sure hope to heaven that you don't think your eternal all the way through right now because and you do you forget it just take one look in the mirror and then look on the wall and see your picture when you was a little kid and see your picture now I think you'd find out if you're not that besides when you get up and get over them aches and pains and start popping in pills you know in trying to exist in a world and you think you're eternal Oh see that's the problem I swear we need our body is not eternal it's in the world of Satan's domain our spirit is in the reason memory consciousness and affections and think it's in that domain also and that's where Satan's working but the soul of the individual is born again has eternal life dwelling within that person that is the new birth or do you think we're going to have to wait - one of these days one of these days we're going to get a new birth well you got how something start live good at least you tell us what we got I know what you're doing with our face that we went to it they taught this message right here is turning it upside down and saying that's what you're saying no the Prophet told us what it was you're born again at faith the new birth you have eternal life in your soul and then you're beginning to take on the very nature of Almighty God right you understand what I'm driving out he said yeah but but I know the prophets message and I've studied it and listen well praise God just keep listening said he spends a lot of especially from 63 on to 65 he spends a lot talking about that you always was eternal that you come to this seed in you all of these things and talking about before the foundation of the world before the foundation of the world it's not just God's mind that he saw the things that's all you're doing with predestination that's the fatherís mankind has received in predestination you can argue that all you want to but you tell me about it you show me something this message preaching predestination I'll tell you just keep listening you're going to listen huh see but God look down and show all of this it is not God's plan and purpose to redeem all mankind you remember what we brought out when Steve what design he said God didn't come to redeem the devil's children well you're making a certain people out of no I'm not I'm doing what God says he's won it made it a certain people yeah but I thought we had to wait until we come down here and see that's true because if you don't receive it down here you wouldn't back down now if Jesus Christ had not have come and died on the cross that would have made all the Old Testament Scriptures void because every one of them pointed to him coming to die on the cross right it would have made it of no account to us but yet when he died there on Calvary that fulfilled all of those Old Testament Scriptures that brought all of that to life and brought an opportunity from Calvary an opportunity for a person to be able to receive eternal life into their soul you agree and see there's no other way to get eternal life except by him bringing it into you but come on then once you receive eternal life the eternal life always was eternal it always was eternal you know what I got this quote work let's see that's what you're doing you're killing yourself with the quotes instead of waiting upon the truth I mean come on down to your ages mankind tried to preach a new birth we might not have had it running in the order of Correction but we at least believed in it you come you talk to a good old bad especially the old ones I'm not making light of the way they say it but he said pretty strong they said you go to heaven you don't have to be born again you know what we don't do it now but you know what them old-timers would do they'd stand up over that body in it laying out there in front of it and says he never got burned again so he's in hell they didn't mind saying it like it was see we try to figure out live it out to give him a chance but come on church we walk to spaces like that I remember they're talking they didn't play games about it they believed you're either born again or you're not they didn't have a handshake in religion or joining the church come on you've heard the prophets say it he said we beat him in the back they come through something it wasn't just what I believe it as always was eternal something about me I just feel it shoulders Napoleone you know you remember the guy he's got it back there you know thought he existed before but listen Church I believe firmly emphatically and stayed it to you that the eternal life that you have in you if you have it now that's where your prophet always uses the word ill if you have eternal life you always was eternal what the eternal life not you I choose an individual don't you as a person as a being even we had to come into this world lost and how to receive eternal life I just believe the message not just say I accept the Jesus Christ so that was the one that really told me when are you missing he said I accepted Jesus Christ and I've listened one day the Prophet he said that's good well for you to accept Jesus Christ we said did he accept you you say I cried I prayed I got down and I done all this it's up to him to save me all right because you're cutting it off something's causing you not to continue on do you continue on until he accepts you oh you're making salvation on the basis of some kind of something master did I believe that's exactly right believing good you've got to have it with your Old Testament science believed ah why didn't they get born again we see I believe it was born again but it wasn't you might as well forget it cut it but listen do you see why it's so important to receive eternal life because if you don't receive eternal life you don't have eternal life that's plain sensible blunt I don't like you I'll go where I can understand it we'll go right ahead you're still going to face one time you've got to be born again but then that's what people can't follow see if you are born again but around I'm not talking about you as an individual he said not your being here he said but that was part of looking at laying here he said they was part a William Branham that was before the foundation of the world didn't he turn around saying not your being he said if you're part of God now you remember the quote we gave where the Prophet said that God has not going to or God's not complete without you do we believe that within evidently the new birth must be the life of God to come into us to make us his children within what would we worry back before the foundation of world what do you worry about what is this earth at it if you have eternal out now you prove what you would honor right is that sensible if you have eternal life now it proves you had eternal life before the world but sees what I've tried to get you to see we try to take predestination we try to take foreknowledge and we try to back up to a place and we try to use the quotes and the sayings of the Lamb you know the book of life of the Lamb we try to use those signs as trying to put it to a position but that's your stopping that's making God a picker in the chooser that means life is sold out before and then he chooses what he wants but you see what I've tried to get you to see for 40 something years is one time and I admit I didn't see it but I tried to preach it and I see it when I see something I'll preach up to it and I just leave it laying there when he picks it up and takes it all I'll preach on it but until he does I won't preach on it he because I know that you can get it all messed up but see eternal life is a person it is not a concept or a thought it's the actual person coming and living you will brother they're like I don't remember that I would maybe it didn't happen is it you said well you're making me lost come on I'm right here standing it and I said there's forty years ago when I say it today I wish to God I could preach it were that everybody in this building that was lost could come to salvation but you know what you can't come to it until you realize your loss until you realize you're lost Jesus Christ never done anything for you you've got a blanket throw that for mankind and that's what I'm trying to tell you you've got a predestination plan that is went back in and picked up with the Prophet had been able to to back up a lot of things we just remember you got him picking and choosing you got him looking down upon all mankind and figuring out and in your quote God knew I wanted to be saved so he had it for me well praise God that's true you know what I was the bad fish I could have said that cause it's true you see that's what I say your foreknowledge is your predestination is just dealing with the part of the mind of God that he would be able to see all things you're not opening up to the understanding that to look at him and let him not pick and choose you realize what I talking about Wednesday what I just quote it but you need them I'm going to lay in here where retron sitting we're a part of God he's not complete without us you realize then that part of you that's eternal was eternal before the world but there was a time you had to receive it good if you didn't receive it then you've missed it eternal life is a person it's not a concept or a thought that's what we've been taught all of our lives I accepted Jesus Christ I'm not the host of this and I believe this and I believe that and I know the Lord saved me and what about it Church where we chosen in him or chosen of him you're taking your predestination in your foreknowledge and going back into the mind of God and saying you were chosen of him and you're making it that there was something that you done or didn't do that had something to do with your salvation and how you're going to make it an unconditional covenant to Abraham and Abraham never even had the new birth that's something yet he had an unconditional covenant what about scriptures that we don't like to read God we don't understand what about it things that blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin you mean there's somebody in the world of God won't impute sin a born-again believer because I'm quote the rest of it go to random said God will not impute sin over what the token well that means I can easily like the devil and do what I want to I've got a message on that that keeps coming back I put it parts in you realize that you remember a few weeks ago when I said it it just kept coming back and still coming you realize that if you think that there could be anything you could do or not do we make God save you then you're getting it on conditions and do you realize that if you think though as a Christian that you can do anything you want to and get by with it you're proving you are not a Christian that's not a Christian statement that's a devil statement for you to say I can just do anything I want to I'm a Christian that's coming from Satan that's not coming from God you remember what I've tried to explain to you so you say well will it don't matter what I done I don't little shady deal over here that's all right I'm a Christian I know I've been this without of the other but I believe I'm saved why would you think that would why would you ever have any thoughts that you could get by with anything I've tried my best to preach your truth to you it there's two judgments in the Bible right one of them is a watch on judgment you better not stand a tad you better be sitting on the judgment with him to judging right because the bride will be when you realize that your judgment of the deeds done in the body whether good or bad and you realize we're going to have to make a given account well it don't matter about me doing a little show your deal our daughter understands me I'm going to put it as plain as I can if we think that because we're Christians we can get by with anything then you realize what you're saying that is the worst sin that any person could ever commit married ten times living in adultery everything in the world you could that's nothing compared to you or me to think that we could get by because we're Christians heaven help you to think that your daddy and mama would even let you get by in the natural well I'm there to let me tell it is you're not a good child in you're a bastard born child this is not respecting your mother's and daddys you see when I get to that away I get hard I know it when you realize if you think you're getting by or something there's going to be a reckoning day and for heaven's sake don't think this way well I know there's going to be a reckoning day but I'll still make it I've made my statement years ago I'll still keep making it I am NOT d Christianizing nobody called we're all sinners saved by grace I don't de Christian I have nobody but you realize that there are things in our lives that if we're not straight and living it right we are going to the grave now don't tell me we're going to walk off us earth in the rapture when our lives don't line up to a good Christian now using this song all you want to he said well I I just cut a little bit of a higher I can get by that cause nobody don't see it I know one sitting here she don't mind me saying I've heard you ever heard women talk about iron in their heart you know what you do when you iron you higher you burn off the ends but that's as good as cutting come on so you brother Dale shrub I need let's see we don't get by with him time you see what I put on just a little bit of makeup just a little bit you're not going in a change of the body wearing makeup I need Christianizing hit going into hell never heard enough so we're all human you know what that means that means what God told me years ago to be the truth he said the biggest portion of people of this message and he was referring to people of this message and I put it in the category that he was referring even to Christians he said they're going to die and go by the grave because they'll not be able to take the change you think I'm pointing to someone that's died of your family or this without a deal you're wrong I'm pointing to every one of us old age is taking some health takes on death take some that ain't got to do what I'm talking about you ain't listening that you see anything we think we can get by with because we're a Christian we're going by the grave but somebody's going to stand here one day and be changed you know what it ain't going to be no good person cuz they ain't no good person there's going to be somebody that's trying somebody that's repentant what did God choose David and say David was a man after his own heart how long have you only stand here talk about he was adulterous he was a murderer he was a whoremonger he would all the things in the world David was but yet God said he was a man after his own heart you mean God like so signs all the difference in David's heart and mankind he had an honest and a contrite heart he repented even Scofield knows it but a random will tell you Scofield you read it where David is on his way home from the bed of that Sheba and said that's when he cries out return unto me the joy of thy salvation even caught that as a scholar I'm not trying to decrease you not nobody if you die and go by the grave that just means one thing for certain you're going to beat me up and raise before I change I'm not trying to decrease United I'm trying to make it straight so you lose the point the point is what if we're trying to make it by some other way then to the blood of Jesus Christ then we're lost to start with if we say we always was eternal if we cause we got a quote from brother Branham you see you you be careful cause we talking about a prophet I've been over and over and over it I'll be glad to face him with everything he said because the same Holy Spirit that said it through him I believe is the same Holy Spirit is saying right now the eternal life that you have in your soul always was eternal but there was a time you didn't have it and I didn't have it there was a time your prophet had to get a new birth and see that's why you can tie together then all the Old Testament is waiting on this day without us cannot be made perfect see then there's some here is waiting line because we got to come to that place to understand who we are do you realize what I'm talking about see that should make everything as you listen to a tape and you hear brother Branham say you always was eternal you come with a scene in your dollar hey man I now know what happened because I used to think that I didn't have to worry about nothing I can't believe the message but now no one realizes based on whether or not I received eternal life and I don't care who you are who we are whose was if you don't receive eternal life you don't have it we'll get to it there's only one man in the Bible that God had parted a man and a wife he imparted eternal life to Adam and Eve we've been through the blasphemous names and read it he's never done that after then why because they fell from that place not the eternal lost they fell to death because you can't have an eternal sinner even your Bible plainly tells you if you read it it talks about how that he's had got to put them out last day for take of the Tree of Life and watch and live forever he didn't say protect to the tree life and live eternal though there's no way to protect the tree I mean the tree of death there's no way to protect the tree of death and live forever that's what's killing us you got to have the Tree of Life the Tree of Life is the Word of God you see that's why we're trying our best to bring it to you because he it were chosen in him remember I brought it right at the end Wednesday chosen in him not just chosen I am that goes into the whole line of predestination and you know that we're just chosen of him or like that Jim by him choosing us out as an individual he's a per here is a showing respect to person but if we were chosen in him now the Bible should come alive you realize he died as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world right is that true and the book on the life of the lamb remember I was just reading it oh good Judas his name was in the book a lot but removed but he said it was not in the eternal section so there's a section of the book of life the Bible that is talking about eternal life but there's a section of it this is talking about life there's pre destinations there's where you mankind as far as he's went with predestination is to book of life we think we understand I'm talking about God in his offspring come on give me a just a minute to that God and his offspring you you think that you're our child of God by the new birth come on I'm not actually raise your hand I'm asking raise your heart you realize by being a born-again Christian that that means that life within you is a part of Almighty God if it's a part of Almighty God then God living in you you realize then before the world ever begun God had his attributes have we been through long enough now in the message but six or seven sermons dealing specifically on that you remember Wednesday night when I brought it because it was one of this kind of held a little bit because we should talk about these attributes is being father but he had an attribute to be a son you remember that Winston I just kind of held out a little bit for you to think a tribute to be a son well Shawn's gotta forget that Sunday now no beginning now I want to ask you a question see if you put it in your mind and think about your born-again Christian aren't you what did you have a beginning the born-again part it but you yourself had to have a beginning that's why you're called a son of God realizing then you say well what I'm trying my best to preach it to you folks and notice I cry and praying for some way I've tried to get you back into God's mind enough to go back to work that you would go back to the point that we could realize that God was real that not just he's the spirit he's just this out of the other God was real he lived in a real world before this thing ever started before he started anything this way he was already tired and he built a man you remember that what was God's plan and purpose were to build a man in his own image he did Genesis 1:26 and 27 he built a man in his own image you realized then by building the man in his own image in His image with what he was he said well what does God look like does he look like this we look like that oh I don't know what he looks like within if he made us in his info but that's not this out here but that that inside man will praise God for the inside man but you know the outside man you think it's not in the image of God may I quote it this way so if you make sure you keep it right become in our image our likeness right cool you've got your animals of creations coming down then you got man created and you got God coming in our image just like us right he had just what we got he looked just like we did you know what that must have been evidently what he wanted to start with I thought we believed that he wanted and here's where we use it to that point we say he wanted us to be where he could have fellowship with us now what does that mean give me a second what does it mean to how fellowship now you can out fellowship with one another you can talk to one huh what is supposed to be your real fellowship you're in your offspring right I sure don't close your mind will maybe she'll fall 10 don't worry about it don't blame the other part of it must I'm sorry I mean I guess you know we see we blame the other side there's always two sides you can go to town and buy meat and it's so thin until I put ten pieces of meat on my my sandwich to eat coat is so thin I can't even find it between my teeth but you know why I still got two sides you blame everybody else instead of blaming yourself maybe your children don't want this message because they don't like you and your ways of expressing it now you shouldn't leave that way brother Dale is it true or not like I told them here go down and watch them every one of them fall bushes won't like this and everyone have them bend over every one of them Dale the only one that stand up straight I don't know where he caught her done but she watching Dale standing for the straight you know look you know why because Tom walk like that and they walk like her daddy listen church I'm simply trying to get one point to you we think we understand predestination and we think we go back to $4 and done but what about going on back into the very mind of God to realize if we are the children of God if we have eternal life that eternal life we have always was eternal and that's his children that's his offspring she didn't he ain't picking and choosing that's where you don't get predestination is so wonderful we talked about he don't pick and choose but he does pick and choose in the natural life of mankind according the way they live and go right oh we go with Jacob how I love day before either one I've ever done either you think he didn't know what Jacob wanted we're doing what I saw with you you realize that as far as we go with our predestination said I want to get this to a close chosen in him when he before the world stood as a lamb slain your name was written in the book of life from he's far God is concerned I'll quote brother branham I go to laying in understudy large brother Brian as God is concerned ever born again person was already saved right every person that would ever be saved or saved right there because your name was written there are left out see then if you try to deal with some way of getting your name written into the book as far as your going to go is a predestination or situation and you're not going back to be part of God you realize that the DNA they can do it with the mother or the father either one you realize your DNA can be run all the way back we see here is what gets me with the people of the message in the way they think look let's go don't you tell me I'm serpent seed it wouldn't make better difference if I could run my DNA and go every bit of it would go back to that beast that was standing in the garden and inject it into the human race this would not bother me one bit that would make me glory and say hallelujah he could save something like that because see that's not what you're talking about see that's what everybody wants to talk about they get all of these things involved with us we were talking about it the other day while you got Judah and Tamar in the Bible oh I've heard the people this message preached that the only women it was right to do this the only one rights come on the lineage coming down to Jesus Christ comes right through David from Bathsheba which was playing out adultery or getting two things Judah and Tamar she tricked him but it was playing adultery but that only carried the natural lineage that was not a spiritual lineage you can't bring a spiritual lineage through David and Bathsheba I'll quote you bread around you know that bread around said Bathsheba was made for David he won't that one don't try to get into marriage and divorce with me about it because it ain't going to work because I'm on quarter water scripturally and tell you you and I don't understand so we just leave it alone I got my straight line and appreciate but I've got things in there the back seat when David is sticking unto her and not straight from there but you know what tickles me to death it tickled me to death to say this when I was in the Baptist Church I knew the lineage never went to Mary there's no lineage going to marry women are not encountered in the lineage there's no lineage there's no way to get one the lineage goes to Joseph what was Joseph the daddy of Jesus no but if he had to protected her they wouldn't have been no Jesus but you see we think that well listen no it's time to get down to understanding but what are you talking about I'm talking about that it born-again experience you have making you a part of God was a part of God before the world ever begun and a part of God before he ever you started thinking about what this world was going to be like that's what I believe about eternal life then you can see that hey I believe in eternal life the life that he had has got to be transmitted into you and me to give us a new birth now the new birth that we have always was eternal well it what it is it obviously are you saying we just come to a knowledge No I've never talked something like that I told it to start with on this message that's wrong to think you just coming to a knowledge of something knowledge puffeth out remember but when you come to a realization or a revelation you realize then how eternal eternity really is but you're making us part of God I didn't make us part of God he made us part of him when he come up with the point did he had attributes within him and one of those attributes was to be a son now we're going to take that son and start the creation of the world then you'll see why we read John's much that son remember that son was the word remember that son was internal that son never had a beginning yeah but he's a son that's just terms that's words when God stepped over in another form and became the word it was not another god it was the same God you agree loving you shaking your head you saying okay you agree now let's see if you agree with the rest of it when he stepped over into and became even into human flesh he was Almighty God you believe that be careful shaking your head because you know I'm going to say something what about when he stepped over into you what about when he stepped over into you he makes you a child of God a son of God a daughter of God why because the life is see that it's not a second person will go back to thee when he comes from father down to son to create it's not a second person it's the same person in another form now if God is not complete without you then evidently on the day of Pentecost he stepped over into a people that he could not step into any old testament why because there was no way made what about eternal life then the eternal life I have always was eternal the seed of God was in me where did the Prophet say it we give it Wednesday what'd he say he said the seed was put in you before the foundation of the world now you're going to argue with him okay but you're going to say you don't believe the way brother Dale's presenting well I'm trying to present it what he said he said the seed was putting us before the foundation of the world now what part of us here's the point what part of us was before the foundation world not this body not a spirit or soul called Samuel Dale cause in you and have total pre existences what part where would that seed put before the foundation of the world we've put in Jesus Christ to become all and all is that Scripture it is all in all when Jesus Christ I'm saying Jesus Christ not the flesh because he that's reason I keep saying it so somebody come along brother Dave Jesus Christ no Jesus the flesh never created nothing Jesus the flesh didn't exist before the world but Jesus the Christ Jesus the Almighty God the Great Eternal Father except over into flesh to die that that life could be released right back out of that because that body wouldn't eternal anything's not eternal got to be redeemed are you listening then what part of you laying our bread around said said there was some part of William Branham back before the foundation of the world you see ever born-again believer some part of you was before the foundation the world because we're not just getting eternal life in a white throne remember he didn't come to save the devil's children the devil's children now you're going to listen for a second the devil's children you and I were right in the middle of that situation oh no we got this sowing of the seed and we got the devil so in this part all of us were seen as the devil all of us needed to redeem her if we didn't need a redeemer what do we need to remember for if we didn't need it see that gets to where I know I don't have enough time to bring out what I'm talking about and I'll leave you dangling I'm sorry what I try to make it as plain as I can I believe the minute you come to the altar brother Brennan said you receive eternal life right there an altar well then what do you need eternal life in the altar if you already had it is that sensible if you already had it what do you need to receive it because it's the fact that we didn't have it Jesus Christ according to my Bibles to the lamb slain before the foundation of the world you know what he done that 2,000 years ago to make it a reality you realize before the foundation of the world he looked down and saw his children and brought around said days a word or seed forever age so that means he spread it out over the ages to bring his children you realize those children are just as eternal as our Father but it's got to be transmitted to earth to where we can receive it because you see whether you believe it or not my Serena keep emphasizing it Adam stood in the Garden of Eden with eternal life in your soul your prophet said it with his body and his spirit was lost I don't mean lost like that God hadn't been allowed at that time but it was not eternal that's the part he could fall in his body and his spirit mainly new spirit we would lead into his body for the body dis this place will you realize that if we did everyone been brought that would away we'd had come we'd come like Adam but there's got to be the other attributes and the thoughts and the things we've got to be displayed so he allowed us to come but he knew the minute you'd receive eternal life he assigns you an angel according to your prophet was a angels according to the Bible a ministry experience made to be for the servant the children of God or that his offspring he was right there to make sure you come to the right place but then one day you had to come to that place you had to receive eternal life now God's plan is perfect well what if they hadn't have been are seen in the garden now there's no way to say they wouldn't because they already had the tree of knowledge and the Tree of Life he knew it was going to be that way but what if they hadn't have been a fall you realize all God had to do was create a body and he could just drop down in eternal life into the soul and there you would stand there you realize when we all come forth and everything was finished we go to the Tree of Life and / take of the Tree of Life in these bodies would be made eternal we know it wasn't going to happen but are you understanding me what if it didn't happen you realize it did happen because you come in the world lost with a day you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior he come to live in you to bring forth that predestinated plan into you and you didn't do it for the devil children everybody won't have it becoming stepped inside of you I thought that this Bible was the Tree of Life I thought this Bible was the Tree of Life I thought we were eating this I thought your prophet said we've become the word as we received one heard not letters on a page with quickened revelation in her heart nothing didn't change God's getting this predestinated plan just exactly but there's a lot of people going to be in heaven that had nothing to do with salvation he's gonna impart eternal life to a lot of people because they just was good to you maybe the eternal life is different than just a thought now listen to what I'm saying and those who receive eternal life at the white throne not a one of them will be the children of God they will just be an impartation right but you know why they're going to be an impartation because you fail and by you falling it gives them a change so you know what they are going to look up to us and say thank you for coming come on think on these things I'm trying my best to explain that before the world the only thing that existed was God himself but at that time we were there in him waiting the time to come into human flesh and to fulfill the rest of his plan and purpose with mankind so don't stop your doctrine and thoughts of predestination and only go back and stand in heaven in God's mind try your best to understand that if God did have a mind and thought about it the party was thinking with is him and eternal life you have now is a very part of Almighty God don't make no difference about the rest well if I predestinated appease our Aaron goes back to what I say and want to go that we think that we're Christians we can just get by with any time remember not don't do it wouldn't it be horrible to realize one day that you turn down the opportunity to come to a change of the body because you would not be sincere enough as a Christian we were talking yesterday and every day we're working in really calling us brother callings what's happened to the Christian life I said what's going wrong people don't care anymore go to church I'm not letting this message out I'm out I'm going to this message people don't care anymore well I bless God I understand it I know it I'm strong go ahead what we got listening think on these things if you have eternal life the eternal life you have always was eternal if you don't have it then you got to get it brother windy had a little old saying the way he made it he said dog it was all worldly say another day he said to be able to get something you gotta go where to stop said no I mean third Amen if you're looking for corn liquor you had to go work for liquor was night today you look super dope you gotta go order dope down you realize realize what God has done for you and me you look the word star for the stuff sack [Music] we lay our hands upon our sister to believe you they'd buy your strategy steel we thank you we believe that thank you for heart it's already finished now Lord the part of our sister since you need to touch from you because that not gift for healing that's current even we ask you to just reach down and touch our sister and Lord and let her understand what's taking place for her to follow you and your Worth and the wall cane crotch we believe in Jesus anybody else what about why stubble predestination like not even a judgement for knowledge when I walk are went back into the top part of Hill see that's exactly what you're doing I thought we believed the statue of a perfect man was the protector of the nature of God enjoy Christian growth in God bottles it yet being a sunburn he'll be hit by the thangs he suffered and being made perfect anybody else [Music] eternal love a birthday remember then the wind with rudder Brady said he has me a question talk about the resurrection I said the resurrection there's a person brother did you believe that that's exactly what I got everything I've got lays down the resurrection is a person cause it's Jesus Christ your resurrection lays inside of you in your spirit Jesus Christ it would understand any but there's nothing we was nothing back there before the world - just a part of God don't make a people Souls or anything make us a part of God then you'll understand why the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy the probably said when they see the plan of redemption they seen what was going to happen on earth it fulfilled God's Word manifest Christ father we thank you for the day we ask you to just help us and maybe we can move on with what we tried to open how to tell our hearts for the people the will firm believer in eternal life but we're also a firm believer that we came into the world lost doomed and on the way to hell and had to be born again to receive that eternal out but once that eternal life comes within our soul then that eternal I've always was eternal and we're just a part of God a child of God thought you stepped over into human flesh back there to become that son and now you're doing the same into your bride because you're coming into the world word night place drink son of mine bless us as we go into natural me or bring us back together forgive our sin lead us in Jesus you're just missed you
