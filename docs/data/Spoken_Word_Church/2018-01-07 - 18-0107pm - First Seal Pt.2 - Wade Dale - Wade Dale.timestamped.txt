[11:42] one of you that are here so I got a
[11:44] couple things I want to share with ya I
[11:46] was thinking of the new year and you
[11:48] know what what brother Brown said about
[11:51] so I was back there they don't have this
[11:53] one in the back but I want to read this
[11:54] this is really interesting their brother
[11:57] branham in 1964 yeah please it's warm up
[12:00] here in Shalom 1964 brother Brown said
[12:04] this was 12 which was 112 but he's so
[12:07] much the new year he says not turn a new
[12:09] page it's turned to the word see what
[12:13] the word promises for today see what a
[12:15] lot of the day is supposed to be what we
[12:18] ought to do this year is not go back to
[12:20] Creed's and things go back to our old
[12:22] denominations not go back to our old
[12:24] denominations but turn to the word see
[12:27] what kind of a light is supposed to
[12:29] shine today old church turned to the
[12:33] word go back to the word flip the right
[12:35] switch quit punching around on
[12:38] electrical lights see artificial
[12:40] man-made turn to his word and see the
[12:43] promise of today and then see what the
[12:45] promise is and watch for its
[12:47] identification when it's vindicated then
[12:50] you know whether you're in the light or
[12:52] not see what the promise is changing the
[12:55] pages our changing calendars doesn't
[12:58] change time we can take up a calendar
[13:02] and put one up and take one down put one
[13:03] up changing the pages or changing
[13:06] calendars doesn't change time a lot of
[13:09] people say well the old years gone throw
[13:11] away the old December calendar now and
[13:13] put up the new one other one the new
[13:15] year that's what New Year's means to
[13:17] them
[13:18] to me this is where we get to me I want
[13:21] to see what's promised for the day I
[13:23] want to know what the light of the hour
[13:25] is so I can know how to walk in it I
[13:29] want to know where I'm living what age
[13:32] I'm in how far up the road I am as Paul
[13:36] said I could stand quoting again
[13:37] forgetting those things which are in the
[13:39] past now I press toward the mark the
[13:41] high calling to the complete
[13:43] identification he said that three or
[13:45] four times to complete identification
[13:48] when all time will fade out into
[13:50] eternity when Jesus comes man what a
[13:54] holiday you know when we go to
[13:55] millennium that's going to be a holiday
[13:58] we don't have anything to do it's a
[14:01] holiday and it's not gonna be where we
[14:04] come to the end of the holiday brother
[14:05] Damian we got to go back to work and
[14:07] then like in the post office you get all
[14:09] this stuff piled up at the end and you
[14:11] just soon work during the holiday as you
[14:13] had work today after because you're
[14:15] doing two or three different days in one
[14:17] day but but this holiday that we're
[14:19] gonna be on for a thousand years it's
[14:21] gonna be a millennium it's gonna be one
[14:22] where you don't have to worry about
[14:24] nothing not one thing are we told that
[14:27] we're to worry about a man now the Jews
[14:30] they've got you know they've got to be
[14:32] there's a king there there's son of
[14:34] David not but us
[14:35] we're on there brother brown called in
[14:37] honeymoon which is a holiday vacation
[14:39] all right so we'll be there for a
[14:41] thousand years so that's one I want to
[14:42] look for I want to look for that one
[14:44] make sure I don't miss that one doesn't
[14:45] matter about these holidays but don't
[14:47] miss that one I'm in and I also saw a
[14:50] quote that I really like listen this
[14:52] said start by doing what's necessary
[14:55] then do what's possible and suddenly you
[15:00] are doing the impossible amen and song
[15:04] now in radio where God were impossible
[15:07] as God's reality you think about all
[15:09] things God's done it's impossible that a
[15:12] virgin was to conceive it's impossible
[15:14] that what you're standing don't come
[15:16] from nothing that's an impossibility to
[15:18] you and I it was an impossibility for
[15:20] God to give you the new birth because it
[15:23] was all contrary but that impossible
[15:27] become a reality when you put God into
[15:31] when you put God into it then that's to
[15:34] me that's the factors when you put God
[15:36] like this quote here in this new year we
[15:39] make resolutions that we break the next
[15:41] day
[15:41] don't make any new year's resolution
[15:44] just do like a prophet of God said look
[15:45] for the identification of your hour this
[15:47] is 2018 never been here before
[15:50] my brother Dale said just stick close
[15:52] we've never been this way before but you
[15:54] know what somebody has God's already
[15:57] been through this whole thing and man so
[15:59] he's the one that's gonna lead us
[16:00] through so if you got your Bibles we
[16:02] turn to the Book of Revelations and
[16:03] we'll back in December the second the
[16:07] last time we spoke we were talking about
[16:09] this first seal but we're gonna continue
[16:10] but we're doing some backgrounding this
[16:12] morning or this afternoon
[16:14] to just kind of get us all back into the
[16:16] into the lineup so revelation 6 verse 1
[16:20] also remember that this coming Thursday
[16:25] I'll be leaving for Minnesota just
[16:27] prayed that we don't get froze in
[16:29] because this is a high up there's been
[16:31] in the teens and the minuses so there's
[16:34] pectin snow Thursday but we're going up
[16:36] to see brother rush dunker he's been
[16:39] watching in our services and we're gonna
[16:42] have some fellowship with him and then
[16:44] brother Jason DeMars has asked me to
[16:46] speak at his church up there in
[16:48] Minnesota on Sunday so I'll be there
[16:50] Sunday speaking for them and coming back
[16:52] on Monday so this keeps thinking prayer
[16:54] that we don't get stuck in Minnesota no
[16:58] offense but I like it down here this is
[17:01] home and also remember on February the
[17:04] 25th we'll be in Mobile Alabama at
[17:06] brother Matthew braze and I want to
[17:10] thank you all for the cards and the
[17:11] gifts and the letters and all the things
[17:13] that we got for Christmas and I what
[17:15] brother Dale gave us for Christmas thank
[17:17] him and I appreciate all of you we just
[17:20] I told them downstairs and and I mean
[17:24] this this is the family I have I'm
[17:27] fortunate to have a family that's in the
[17:29] message and some of you are not but I'm
[17:32] glad that we have the church family all
[17:34] back together the church family is the
[17:35] most important
[17:38] we can communicate where you can't
[17:41] communicate we'll give your real family
[17:43] I mean honestly you know you you love
[17:46] them you love them with all your heart
[17:47] but there's just no communication there
[17:49] when you're of two different opinions or
[17:51] two different minds you know so but it's
[17:53] good to be because you know we're gonna
[17:55] spend eternity with this family it's an
[17:57] eternal family that we're born into so
[18:00] let's go to revelation 6 verse 1 let's
[18:03] bow our heads to Heavenly Father we pray
[18:05] Lord that you'd be with us today truly
[18:08] this is a new year a new time that will
[18:11] let the things in the past be passed and
[18:13] we'll press Lord toward the mark of the
[18:15] high calling see our identification for
[18:17] this age see the light that is shine for
[18:21] us Lord in this endtime forgive us of
[18:23] our sins bless the ones that are sick be
[18:26] the ones on the highways Lord be with
[18:28] the ones that are in the fields with
[18:31] missionaries doing their work Lord give
[18:33] them fruit for the labor bless the ones
[18:35] Lord there in India that's having some
[18:37] problems there with the orphanages and
[18:38] things Lord the brother Boaz has been
[18:41] sending us some messages Lord we pray
[18:43] that you would intervene because all
[18:45] things are possible to them that believe
[18:47] when we look at the impossible we know
[18:50] that there's a possible God behind all
[18:53] these things forgive us of our sins
[18:55] bless this day in Jesus name Amen
[18:59] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[19:01] the seals and I heard as a word the
[19:03] noise of thunder now you're not gonna
[19:04] hear that again it doesn't thunder it
[19:08] ever seal ok got it when you heard the
[19:12] noise of the Thunder we'll get to that a
[19:13] little while maybe later on the next
[19:15] message one of the four beasts saying
[19:17] come and see so there's a there's a
[19:18] beast involved we'll get into all those
[19:21] symbols in just a little while I'll put
[19:22] the board up in a minute but I want to
[19:24] background first before we do that I saw
[19:27] and behold a white horse and he that sat
[19:28] on him had a bow and a crown was given
[19:31] unto him now look watch these things
[19:33] that were given a crown was given to
[19:36] this person he didn't have one he was
[19:38] given one and he went forth conquering
[19:41] and to conquer you may be seated in the
[19:44] world at his blessing to the reading of
[19:46] the word I just want to like I said
[19:49] we're gonna background for a little
[19:50] while
[19:51] and then we will look at some of these
[19:54] symbols I want to want you to remember
[19:57] one thing that the thing that we thought
[20:00] all these years may not be exactly the
[20:04] way we should see it because when we get
[20:08] involved with these with the opening of
[20:11] the seals we know as as brother Dale has
[20:13] already taught us over and over and over
[20:15] and over again that the seals are for
[20:18] Redemption purpose not to not to so much
[20:24] and it does the Bible does say reveal
[20:26] the wicked one it does it makes known
[20:28] who he is but this this that we're
[20:30] talking about is a revelation of Jesus
[20:32] Christ all the way from Genesis to
[20:34] revelations that's why one seal can tie
[20:37] the entire book of the Bible two books
[20:39] of the Bible together because if you
[20:41] don't see Christ in every verse go back
[20:43] and read it again
[20:44] alright so if Christ is the seals then
[20:47] you ought to be able to go to Genesis
[20:48] wanted to read the seals and then you
[20:50] should go to Jeremiah and read the seals
[20:53] and you should go to Isaiah and read the
[20:55] seals because you watch brother branham
[20:58] uses many scriptures when he's going
[21:00] through the seals many scriptures all
[21:02] over the Bible many many scriptures he
[21:04] uses he doesn't just use one or two or
[21:07] three he uses an entire I mean all the
[21:09] way over into Jeremiah and the ones
[21:12] using the where they put the scrolls and
[21:16] the earthen vessels he brings that into
[21:18] the seals because Michael they were
[21:19] sealed up and then they were what made
[21:21] known they were taken out opened up and
[21:23] read all right which were the scrolls
[21:26] that they put in earthen vessels which
[21:28] is this earthen vessel that we're
[21:29] looking at here all right so we're just
[21:31] gonna background real quick let's go to
[21:35] Matthew 24 verse four and let's read
[21:37] what as keep these things in the back of
[21:40] your mind the seals have already been
[21:43] preached Matthew 24 Jesus steps forward
[21:47] and he doesn't step forward and say the
[21:50] white horse rider is all right the black
[21:52] horse rider is no one I don't think no
[21:55] one knew that until brother Branham even
[21:57] comes to what is it the sixth seal fifth
[21:59] seal six seal and the Lord reveals to
[22:02] him
[22:03] what he's preaching has already been
[22:05] spoken in the book of Matthew by the
[22:07] Lord Jesus himself brings the six seals
[22:11] because remember they asked him they
[22:13] said what what's the sign of your coming
[22:14] when's the end and all these things they
[22:16] asked him those three questions and he
[22:18] answered them under the what under the
[22:22] seals because he said right here right
[22:25] here's where the first one in jesus
[22:26] answered or sent unto them take heed
[22:28] that no man deceive you for many shall
[22:31] come in my name saying I am Christ and
[22:34] shall deceive many all right and we know
[22:38] that that's exactly what happened he was
[22:40] telling us that Satan now remember as
[22:45] brother Dale hit on a little bit this
[22:46] morning there's always twins so there's
[22:49] always gonna be one a dark side and the
[22:52] light side just like you know you'd see
[22:54] you movies of the jedis and all the
[22:56] force and black force and white force
[22:59] there's always two forces there's only
[23:00] two forces all right so any time we read
[23:04] the Bible though I steam like this
[23:05] yesterday anytime you read the Bible
[23:08] there's an opposition as Bob was talking
[23:11] this morning and brother Branham says
[23:13] any time a prophet hits the earth
[23:16] there's a war right now watch the war
[23:19] he's not warring with itself
[23:21] God doesn't war with God if the devil
[23:25] comes on the scene now remember he's a
[23:28] copycat so that doesn't mean he jumps on
[23:31] the scene first God's always doing
[23:36] something first so when you see these
[23:39] seals and you see a wild horse rider and
[23:41] you see all these things know one
[23:43] thing's for sure God is already working
[23:46] God's already got a white righteous
[23:49] church on the earth for him to be in
[23:53] opposition I was you know you look at an
[23:56] image you know you look at an image well
[23:59] well now in the age of photoshopping see
[24:02] we've come to the end time now to where
[24:03] we're really all things are possible
[24:06] even now even in the physical realm they
[24:10] can take somebody that that's that
[24:12] doesn't look very well and make them
[24:13] look very well why by photoshopping
[24:15] that's the way Satan does he
[24:17] what he takes the image of God and
[24:19] distorts it or changes it now look when
[24:24] God said let us make man in our image he
[24:26] didn't change one thing he made man in
[24:29] His image
[24:30] now what Satan does what we were we were
[24:33] talking about the other day
[24:37] female or a woman was created by God
[24:43] amen and then brother Brown said Satan
[24:46] is her designer now he didn't say Satan
[24:48] was her creator he said Satan was her
[24:51] designer what do you do he took what God
[24:53] had already made
[24:55] he took the image that was already made
[24:58] and what do you do he perverted it he
[25:02] took it to the mental part look at it
[25:05] now it's a woman's age a woman's wear
[25:08] woman rules everything right because she
[25:12] knows how because Satan has an auditor a
[25:15] man Satan has an auditor to know how to
[25:18] do that
[25:19] God's not anointing her to pervert
[25:21] people god never anoints you to provide
[25:23] if you if something is anointed and it
[25:27] becomes perverted no one think god's not
[25:29] in that now God's the original maker but
[25:33] Satan is the original pervert ur right
[25:35] and that's the same way with these seals
[25:37] for many shall come in my name saying I
[25:40] am Christ and shall deceive many take
[25:43] heed that no man deceive you so in other
[25:47] words what's he saying he's saying that
[25:49] there is a mirror image coming that's
[25:51] gonna try to deceive you that's gonna
[25:53] try to pervert you that's gonna say I am
[25:56] Christ that's my brother branham they
[26:00] asked him about Thessalonians there was
[26:02] was that the man of sin was that the
[26:04] first seal he said sure there's your
[26:06] mystery of iniquity
[26:08] there's your mirror image of it looks
[26:10] like God but it's not and that's the
[26:13] most deceptive if what's not deceptive
[26:16] is the guy in the bar the prostitute in
[26:20] the prostitute house that's not
[26:22] deceiving if when you move them under
[26:25] the auspice or under the
[26:27] Church amen
[26:30] under the church then when you put them
[26:33] under the church and then Satan perverts
[26:36] by a religious perversion which is worse
[26:39] than anything that's why to me the seals
[26:44] is a complete plan of redemption because
[26:46] we've been under this yeah we have yeah
[26:51] we have Martin Luther didn't have the
[26:54] complete Word of God he had a part that
[26:56] he played right and like brother Brown
[26:59] said in this in the one I read about the
[27:01] the the New Year Lucas all the light he
[27:05] was in and that's what he lived in
[27:07] that's all he had to live in we were
[27:09] talking about yesterday and I believe
[27:11] this is really important up until at
[27:16] from Adam to this day even you take
[27:19] through Jesus Christ there is no greater
[27:23] time than today that's why the prophet
[27:26] of God said all the prophets look to
[27:27] this day even Jesus Christ pointed to
[27:30] this day he told us what to look for but
[27:34] in that day that Jesus himself the
[27:37] headstone himself walked on the face of
[27:40] the earth he had nobody you saw no he
[27:45] had yeah he had a physical body he
[27:47] didn't have a church body to work
[27:49] through right he even saved anybody when
[27:54] he was here right but then on the day of
[27:57] Pentecost is when the body began to
[27:58] build but what was missing the head was
[28:01] gone the head was going off to the
[28:04] church ages so you had a body with no
[28:07] head I mean you had a head with no body
[28:09] when Jesus was here because Jesus had to
[28:12] leave go away and came back into the
[28:15] body and work through the body but now
[28:17] in the end time the body and the head is
[28:20] to you not amen
[28:24] that's never happened before
[28:27] ever I was thinking this morning they
[28:31] what brother Dale was preaching every
[28:35] human has been born through it alone
[28:39] except by them but it had to be Christ
[28:42] Bob was talking about this morning where
[28:45] the scripture in Romans 8 and I had
[28:48] never seen it in that light before which
[28:49] is good that's why we have a fivefold
[28:51] ministry that's why we have people that
[28:53] teach that's why we have because look
[28:55] why when you're birthed into the body of
[28:58] Christ you don't cry mama mama what do
[29:03] you cry daddy daddy Abba Father because
[29:08] all men born of a woman is dead even
[29:14] Jesus was born of the woman in his body
[29:15] died hey man
[29:20] but if you're born of a man and I just
[29:22] read that yesterday where brother mom
[29:24] said if you're born of a woman you die
[29:26] if you're born of a man you live right
[29:28] so this new birth the brother Dale is
[29:30] talking about this new birth that's
[29:32] coming in it's not a woman birth I
[29:37] thought the scripture said come out of
[29:39] her my people come out of her what the
[29:43] woman come out of heard you say what's
[29:46] this got to do with the seals it's got a
[29:48] lot to do with it because you got to
[29:50] come out of that to see the truth but
[29:53] come out of her my people and what be
[29:55] borne by the man Adam was not born by a
[30:00] woman he was born by a man you said born
[30:03] yo he was full-grown but he came from a
[30:05] man and even when the Bible says that
[30:09] what our mother is New Jerusalem which
[30:12] is the word well the words not a female
[30:13] the words of male and man now we are
[30:17] female in the body you don't get me
[30:19] wrong but our birth is not from a woman
[30:23] that's why Nicodemus couldn't understand
[30:26] he said but I got to go back to a woman
[30:28] and be born if I got to go back to my
[30:32] wife my momma Jesus said I ain't talking
[30:36] about your momma right I'm know about
[30:38] your daddy
[30:39] you gotta be born from your daddy which
[30:41] is above a man same thing with these
[30:44] sales then we have we see that the sales
[30:46] then is what a man right now there's an
[30:53] impostor man but there's a real man that
[30:57] all that comes from a man there's a real
[31:00] man there's a father there's an a by
[31:04] father when we're birthed into the
[31:06] family of God it's by man not a female
[31:10] not a denomination because that's what
[31:13] females are right female denomination or
[31:16] church all right do that all right say a
[31:18] man but remember he says I am Christ and
[31:21] shall deceive many so so you take what
[31:25] Satan is doing and we look in these
[31:26] cells that when the lamb opened the seal
[31:29] we and we from way back several months
[31:32] ago we know that that seal that was of
[31:35] around that piece of this remember the
[31:41] seal is what was tore off all right well
[31:45] the seal part is what we're going to
[31:47] look at as far as the symbols brother
[31:50] Graham called actors players those
[31:53] different things actors and players
[31:55] players of apart actors of a part all
[31:58] right because remember you and I are not
[32:02] actors actors somebody you hire an actor
[32:09] is somebody that comes in and acts the
[32:12] part of someone else now see that's our
[32:14] problem
[32:16] are we acting the part of someone else
[32:19] or are we that person in another form
[32:26] called a bride which is the woman which
[32:30] is fine with me but we came from a man
[32:35] we can come from a woman that Genesis
[32:41] 1:26 never come from a woman he came
[32:44] from
[32:44] man speaking and saying let there be
[32:47] amen that's the same way when the seals
[32:50] were open they were opened by the man
[32:51] Christ Jesus not william branham they
[32:55] were opened by God himself
[32:56] and then why because let me just be
[33:01] honest because Satan was in the pulpit
[33:05] hey man
[33:07] Satan was in the pulpit Satan was doing
[33:10] the preachers listen Jesus Christ God
[33:13] Almighty whatever you want to call him
[33:15] he never preached the Father Son Holy
[33:16] Ghost baptism never cause it's contrary
[33:23] but Satan made it look so good to what
[33:26] the people accepted it there's a
[33:30] deception the people accepted what was
[33:34] already been said like we're talking
[33:37] about the Nicene counsel you know from
[33:41] from through whatever it was 300 and
[33:43] some 325 AD it took 600 for them to
[33:47] develop that and make it something we'll
[33:50] get into that with the seals because
[33:51] remember starts as a saying what do you
[33:55] think about what well that sounds good
[33:58] brother I think I'll take it to this one
[34:01] and then I think I'll take it to this
[34:04] one and Satan says who feel that feels
[34:08] good
[34:10] ain't got nothing do females feels good
[34:13] I think I'll tell it to this one yeah
[34:16] see what I'm saying then what it become
[34:18] a what a saying then he'd become a deed
[34:22] then it became a doctor
[34:25] that's what's bothering me and you now
[34:28] is that some of the things that we heard
[34:31] we'd become indoctrinated with hey man
[34:36] that's my problem I'm talking about me
[34:38] you worry about your own self but I know
[34:40] my me that's my problem
[34:41] I'm indoctrinated with things I need to
[34:45] get rid of
[34:46] let's read in Ephesians 1 verse 17 that
[34:52] the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the
[34:53] father of glory may give unto you the
[34:57] spirit of wisdom that's what I want to
[34:59] this is my this is my Commission to you
[35:02] as we go through these seals cuz look
[35:05] they've already been open
[35:06] they've already been preached Jesus
[35:09] preached them brother Branham preached
[35:11] him brother Dale's preached them in the
[35:13] 80s and in my feeble way I'm gonna try
[35:15] to just stir up your mind just bring
[35:18] them back together and stir up your mind
[35:20] cuz you've already heard these things
[35:21] but watch but I want this to happen they
[35:25] give you the spirit of wisdom and
[35:27] revelation and the knowledge of him the
[35:29] eyes of your understanding being
[35:31] enlightened that you may know what is
[35:34] the hope of his calling and what the
[35:36] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[35:37] in the Saints and what is the exceeding
[35:40] greatness of his power to us-ward who
[35:42] believe according to the working of his
[35:45] mighty power amen
[35:47] so let's remember one thing if Satan's
[35:52] got any power it's given to him but
[35:57] remember you and I have an inheritance
[35:59] that his power waste it is power it is
[36:05] the power of God unto salvation the
[36:08] Bible says it is the power that God
[36:10] gives what a son and daughter now Satan
[36:15] gets the permittee power that God
[36:17] permits him to have a power to what I
[36:23] believe so that God can prove that we
[36:27] can live in these bodies and that we can
[36:30] receive revelation and that God can
[36:32] change these bodies that have come from
[36:36] a woman and a man getting together and
[36:39] Raptors all impossible that we can take
[36:41] a body change impossible yeah the way we
[36:47] look at it brother dick I was looking at
[36:49] the picture of you this morning it's
[36:52] highly impossible that he can take a
[36:53] body change go I saw him when he was 8
[36:57] years old he liked it now there were
[37:05] some pigs in front of it but then pigs
[37:11] are dead gone brother dick still here
[37:14] the pigs have been eating what I'm
[37:16] saying is that we are we are showing
[37:18] that the curse is still here
[37:20] in our human body but when are we going
[37:24] to say that's not so Phil I was telling
[37:27] telling dad we were we were going down
[37:29] to the hunting club or something I said
[37:30] that's it truly truly Abraham son Isaac
[37:37] came by promise by faith he didn't have
[37:43] to have faith with Hagar that was a
[37:46] natural act that he could perform that
[37:49] produced a child there's no faith in
[37:51] that after he had after he had Isaac
[37:55] let's jump on over to the 7 he got back
[37:59] term by young again he made another wife
[38:01] and guess what they wasn't by faith they
[38:03] had separate more kids but Isaac was by
[38:07] faith it was impossible for Abraham and
[38:13] Sarah to have kids even when they were
[38:15] young so he had to believe not with
[38:21] Hagar
[38:21] not with what but what was right there
[38:24] in front of him right there's no way I
[38:26] can do this Lord but I believe what you
[38:29] said now that's what you and I got to
[38:31] come to the impossible is why I said the
[38:33] impossible is his reality there's no way
[38:36] you see a 99 year old man and a woman
[38:38] coming in they're going to the
[38:39] gynecologist to get a due date come on
[38:48] really
[38:49] go change them back the young man and
[38:53] woman and then change her womb so that
[38:57] she can have what the promised child it
[39:02] came by promise these sails will open to
[39:09] you by promise what do you need faith
[39:13] when you got good health what do we need
[39:16] faith when we can order a steak and
[39:19] baked potato and boy Red Lobster mm-hmm
[39:23] yeah what's that mean really honestly
[39:26] what's that about faith there's not
[39:29] faith there's no faith in that that's
[39:31] why we've got to be the children of we
[39:35] got to see the promise that our that our
[39:38] focus is not that we're gonna make a lot
[39:40] of money or that we're gonna lose a lot
[39:41] of money our focus is not that we got a
[39:42] good car not a good car our focus this
[39:45] is where we can get our body change and
[39:47] get out of here hey man that's the boss
[39:52] get the data out of the ground first and
[39:56] I believe these seals is what's gonna
[39:59] hold us in to that I believe that like I
[40:03] said on I'll read it in just a minute
[40:04] after I read about four or five quotes
[40:06] remember I read it to you before the
[40:07] breaking of the seals is not necessarily
[40:09] for your soul your soul is redeemed by
[40:13] the blood of Jesus Christ I brother
[40:16] Chris did an awesome job about salvation
[40:18] and brother Dale has been doing the same
[40:20] thing because they come together and did
[40:22] a real good job their salvation is of
[40:23] the Lord you believe on what God did at
[40:25] Calvary the seals are for the redemption
[40:29] of your body the seals are only when
[40:32] that head and the body unites in this
[40:34] end time it's never been revealed ever
[40:36] before never
[40:41] but that's our Commission
[40:44] our commission is to take this like
[40:47] we've seen in Bible study last night
[40:49] it's not me it's not you it's the body
[40:53] of Christ believing that that promised
[40:56] son is going to come through us not
[41:01] through someone else through eyes all
[41:08] right let's do a number one first steel
[41:12] man is hot up here
[41:16] and at the end of the pen council age
[41:18] we're supposed to receive according to
[41:19] the word is God helped me tonight to
[41:21] show you through here that we are to see
[41:23] receive a messenger that we know where
[41:25] the messenger come in right we know who
[41:29] the messenger was he delivered his
[41:31] message all right because remember when
[41:36] Moses went off the scene and Joshua took
[41:38] over that didn't just take away their
[41:41] problems as soon as he stepped over into
[41:45] the Promised Land there was all the
[41:47] mites came up and he had to fight them
[41:50] all and I've been reading through the
[41:51] kings and all that man they fought Wars
[41:53] every day my brother Tom said it's just
[41:56] war stories that war right after another
[41:58] they kill a king and bring a king they
[42:00] kill the prince and bring another one
[42:01] they killing and Kemp and got in town go
[42:04] kill them all okay but we this end time
[42:11] is we're killing demons we're not
[42:12] killing people okay we're killing demons
[42:15] the demons that I have
[42:17] they gotta be dead you got to figure out
[42:21] what pick what demons you bothers you
[42:22] and then receive a messenger that will
[42:26] take all these loose ends what I'm
[42:27] saying is even when Joshua got in the
[42:29] promised land they fall they fought they
[42:34] fought Wars you and I have got to
[42:36] overcome more than anybody's ever
[42:39] overcome amen and I believe when we see
[42:44] these seals open it shows that that
[42:46] you've got all your combat beats they're
[42:48] working for you they're working they're
[42:50] working for you because when they're
[42:53] gone
[42:53] we're going now I love that when they're
[42:56] gonna work
[42:56] amen so they're here now with us and
[43:00] then we're gone they leave with us
[43:04] receive a messenger that will take all
[43:06] these loose ends out there and reveal
[43:08] the whole secret of God for the writing
[43:11] of the church so in other words bring it
[43:13] all together and then there's coming for
[43:16] seven mysterious thunders that's not
[43:18] even written at all that's right now
[43:21] look Jesus preached the first seal and
[43:23] never said anything about a while wars
[43:24] writer amen so there must be something
[43:29] hid under there that we must see that
[43:31] when the Prophet brings it it opens it
[43:32] we see what's going on we see now I
[43:36] don't mean say I mean understand when I
[43:37] say see you got to know I mean to
[43:39] understand all right we've been looking
[43:41] at these letters for what 60 something
[43:44] years these letters seeing them but we
[43:50] must see them with our soul see them
[43:53] with the understanding of our heart amen
[43:56] and then there's coming because remember
[43:58] it's like I told you many many times
[44:00] before we must see the essence of the
[44:02] message because you can take this quote
[44:05] right here and I'll find you one that
[44:06] says the seven thunders is not that you
[44:08] know you can always find an opposite
[44:10] well who's finding the opposite if
[44:15] there's only to Louise there's only two
[44:19] who's finding the opposite if God is the
[44:22] truth if you find an opposite it's not
[44:25] God opposing itself you see where we see
[44:29] that that thing's got to be riding away
[44:31] from amen
[44:33] then that's coming for seven mystère
[44:35] stunners it's not even written at all
[44:37] that's right and I believe that through
[44:38] these seven thunders will be revealed in
[44:41] the last days in order to get the bride
[44:43] together for rapturing faith now there's
[44:46] that faith of Abraham that father of our
[44:49] faith listen he was the father not the
[44:51] mother he was the father of our faith
[44:54] you can get something with that Bob you
[44:56] just wait because what we got right now
[44:59] we wouldn't be able to do it there's
[45:03] something we've got to step further we
[45:06] can't have enough faith for divine
[45:08] healing hardly
[45:09] we've got have enough faith to be
[45:11] changed in a moment and be swept up out
[45:13] of this earth and we'll find that after
[45:16] a while the Lord willing find words
[45:18] written all right so we'll continue on
[45:20] with the next quote number number two
[45:26] still in the first seal now the Seventh
[45:28] Seal roll book is now being released by
[45:30] the RAM we approached that place tonight
[45:32] god help us as the seals are broken and
[45:35] released the mysteries of the book are
[45:37] revealed now we see this as a seal you
[45:40] see this is a sealed book now we believe
[45:43] that do we not we believe that it is a
[45:46] sealed book now we know we never know
[45:48] this before but it is it's sealed with
[45:52] seven seals that is on the back of the
[45:54] book the book is sealed with seven seals
[45:56] all right excuse me if we was talking
[45:59] about this kind of book it would be like
[46:01] putting a strap around until my list
[46:03] book seven straps but it isn't that kind
[46:05] of book it's a scroll remember it rolled
[46:07] up and then when the scroll is unwound
[46:10] that's one then laying right in the
[46:12] scroll is number two I you know you say
[46:16] what what seals the most important well
[46:18] I believe the first seal is the most
[46:20] important because if that first seal
[46:21] didn't open the second one's not going
[46:22] to once that scroll is open
[46:26] Bojan once that Scrolls open you got one
[46:29] two three four you're just sitting there
[46:31] reading you're just sitting there
[46:33] reading them but if that number once
[46:34] closed up and that seals on it I don't
[46:37] care what you do you can't thumb through
[46:39] there and find two and three and four
[46:40] you got to get number one that's why the
[46:42] thunders sounded on that first seal you
[46:46] ma'am then you can see that as that book
[46:48] is open then the seals tore off you just
[46:51] start flipping pages because you already
[46:53] Saul ready open how you gonna understand
[46:55] too if you don't get one you just can't
[46:58] if we were talking about this kind of
[47:00] book we'd put a strap on it but it isn't
[47:02] that kind of book it's a scroll and when
[47:04] the scroll is unwound that's one then
[47:06] laying right in the scroll is number
[47:08] right in the scroll is number two right
[47:10] here it says what it is but it's a
[47:12] mystery but yet we have proved in it but
[47:14] remember the book is sealed in the book
[47:16] is a book of mystery of what revelation
[47:18] it is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[47:22] see the book of Revelation and now you
[47:25] know down to the age man has probed and
[47:27] tried to get into it we all have all
[47:31] right number three now these the ones
[47:32] I'm gonna read you talking about what
[47:36] these seals are cuz we can't we got to
[47:38] know what they are for we get started
[47:39] all right everybody say ma'am we got a
[47:48] few sleep cuz not me but it's the holy
[47:52] spirit the very angel of God that you
[47:54] see what about these days here when all
[47:56] these things taking place now this is
[47:57] before the seal is open this 1961 this
[48:00] is the preaching of the church ages
[48:02] okay okay this is the place preaching
[48:04] the church age and this angel the Lord
[48:06] standing here I wouldn't know these
[48:07] things but it's the hour it's here when
[48:10] we get through those seven spirits the
[48:11] seven horns and things today if the Lord
[48:13] willing you'll see where it's at it's
[48:16] the hour that we're in that these
[48:17] revelations are supposed to come
[48:19] it's the Book of Revelations they're
[48:21] revealing of Jesus Christ and we find
[48:23] out the very first chapter he revealed
[48:24] who he was and now he's getting the
[48:27] seven seals revealing how he redeemed
[48:30] the earth not how he redeemed Satan no
[48:36] no how he redeemed the earth what earth
[48:39] the ball were standing on Nick not yet
[48:44] this fell first then the earth fell so
[48:49] guess what then this has got to be
[48:52] redeemed and then that'll be redeemed so
[48:56] that's what the seals are to do reveal
[48:57] how he redeemed the earth is that
[49:00] Alright amen now let's go to the next
[49:02] one read these real quick standing down
[49:06] here works not so hard they six inches
[49:08] right there and that six inches makes a
[49:09] big difference in the temperature they
[49:11] died and brother Deaton you all know it
[49:13] big time so I'm gonna stand in here for
[49:15] a minute John tells us here in
[49:17] Revelation that the enemy and the last
[49:18] day that religious enemy would get
[49:21] amongst people I'm reading down here
[49:23] this paragraph from him and have
[49:25] organizations and so forth and cults and
[49:27] so forth as they have had today and
[49:29] would deceive the very elect if it were
[49:32] possible and it would deceive all those
[49:34] whose names are not put on the lounge
[49:36] laughs that's the very foundation of the
[49:38] world when was your name put on the
[49:40] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[49:41] foundation of the world we know that
[49:43] when was Christ slain 1990 years ago no
[49:46] sir before the foundation of the world
[49:48] the lamb slain before the foundation won
[49:50] their watch see what it's doing it's the
[49:53] seals opening up just beginning to
[49:56] reveal the plan of the devil that's not
[50:00] what this is
[50:01] oh it says revealed the plan of what
[50:04] redemption how he did it it's all over
[50:10] now just about just about finished up so
[50:13] we're at the end time so that's why the
[50:15] things are being revealed why some plan
[50:17] of redemption amens all right the plan
[50:21] of redemption now number the next one
[50:26] number five Gables instructions to
[50:28] Daniel now that we find that he has our
[50:30] kinsman he was our kinsman redeemer and
[50:33] he took a book out of the hand of the
[50:35] original owner it is the title deed to
[50:37] redemption we found out you remember the
[50:40] study it's a title deed of redemption
[50:42] it's an abstract deed with it that God
[50:44] required life or death in the Garden of
[50:46] Eden then Jesus the righteous one died
[50:49] and took a title deed and was able to
[50:52] what break the seals reveal what was in
[50:55] them and give the inheritance we've read
[50:57] this quote before and give the
[50:59] inheritance that belong to him to his
[51:01] people what is it eternal life that he
[51:04] inherited by doing that now he didn't
[51:06] inherit eternal life in his soul he was
[51:09] eternal life
[51:11] he didn't inherit eternal life in his
[51:13] spirit because he was the holy spirit
[51:14] but he needed that he turned life in his
[51:17] body so what are these cells for they're
[51:20] for the redemption of our body eternal
[51:23] life that he inherited by doing that he
[51:26] passed his own life back out at Calvary
[51:29] and divided it among us by the Holy
[51:31] Ghost amen
[51:32] no man has ever been able to come to
[51:35] even think of the love that that was
[51:36] what he done and there's not listen
[51:40] we're self as a bunch of people bottom
[51:43] line we're selfish bunch of people
[51:46] sure we and we might even wouldn't give
[51:49] our life for somebody else but my life
[51:52] can't go back into the person to save
[51:54] them that's why Christ had to come he
[51:58] come through a woman sure but he wasn't
[52:01] born of a woman the man created the egg
[52:05] and the man created the germ user is an
[52:11] oven so he could be our what
[52:12] kinsman-redeemer
[52:13] hey man she was an avid that's what she
[52:17] was she was an incubator when brother
[52:19] mom said the incubator what is that it's
[52:22] an oven that keeps something that lined
[52:23] me something degrees until it right
[52:25] keeps it warm
[52:26] thank you sister keeps it warm why
[52:29] because it's the widest its life a seed
[52:32] brings forth of its common so we knew
[52:33] that but to be a kinsman redeemer he had
[52:36] to come that way
[52:38] amen but he wasn't born of a woman right
[52:43] he was born of a man the man put the egg
[52:47] there not man let's adjourn there
[52:49] evening I mean Mary didn't have nothing
[52:52] to do with it
[52:53] just the oven and then well I'm sorry
[53:01] did I say incubator some of y'all
[53:03] laughing what's the difference you take
[53:07] an incubator what does an incubator do
[53:09] when I when I raised queen bees I got to
[53:13] keep him at 94 degrees I put him in an
[53:16] incubator you know what I could put him
[53:17] in an oven what does it matter what's
[53:20] the difference
[53:21] she was an incubator she was an oven
[53:26] what to get him here so that he could
[53:28] look at us and say I am like you I got a
[53:33] flesh body like you got I am your
[53:36] brother I read the quote yesterday where
[53:39] brother mom said in his body he was
[53:41] human he had to eat he had to sleep they
[53:45] certain certain things he had to do as a
[53:47] human you know why cuz he that makes him
[53:51] close to us
[53:53] Oh God but close to us everywhere God
[53:57] but ever went man's we still don't get
[53:59] that rock he was gone almighty in human
[54:03] flesh if you're born again today guess
[54:07] what you're in human flesh because you
[54:12] were born from a man the right way we're
[54:20] my number five or number six no number
[54:24] says get this right here at the fourth
[54:26] seal that's the way the church ages in
[54:29] the seals and all the rest of it and
[54:31] when anybody thinks that he has those
[54:33] seven thunders if it don't compare with
[54:34] the rest of the word now my contention
[54:37] is the seven thunders are in the Word of
[54:39] God it's just not one two three four
[54:44] like the seals are why call this a
[54:47] hidden mystery nobody's ever known Amen
[54:50] but it's like to me it's laced in the
[54:53] entire word of God from Genesis to
[54:55] Revelation because in Genesis you got a
[54:58] body change I just talked about Abraham
[55:01] that's in the book of Genesis he took a
[55:03] body shame when he might has those seven
[55:08] thunders if they don't compare with the
[55:09] rest of the word there's something wrong
[55:11] here that's why my contention that the
[55:13] seven thunders or redemption not how to
[55:16] not how to speak something into
[55:18] existence or speak something out of
[55:20] existence that's all in there
[55:23] but those thunders is for if to get this
[55:26] body lined up see it's got to come thus
[55:31] saith the Lord for this is the book this
[55:33] is the revelation of Jesus Christ in its
[55:36] entirety
[55:38] that's your seals right there that's
[55:40] your thunders - alright number seven in
[55:42] Isaiah now watch Isaiah spoke of the
[55:46] sick sail read it what you prophet you
[55:50] said in Isaiah let's take this Isaiah
[55:54] the prophet seen this sick seal open
[56:00] it's all through the word vote Isaiah
[56:04] saw the six he'll look only goats but
[56:12] lamb say thank you Lord and you go he
[56:18] sent you this what you Prophet said why
[56:21] because what and a prophet is what the
[56:23] prophets a seer he can see he saw that
[56:26] six he'll open and spoke of it and I'll
[56:32] bring the scripture later on but it's
[56:34] not part of it today that's whether it's
[56:36] important or not see well the whole
[56:37] thing the whole plan of redemption lays
[56:39] under these seals the whole plan of
[56:42] redemption why because in the Bible
[56:44] there is an earnest there's an earnest
[56:48] when you get born again that's your
[56:50] honest but they're at what until the
[56:53] full possession the full part of
[56:56] redemption lie brother now said this
[56:57] morning when we won't step over into
[57:00] another dimension in a new body this
[57:03] body changed when we step over into
[57:06] another dimension redemption for us is
[57:09] over right okay the whole plan of
[57:15] redemption lays under these seals the
[57:16] whole book what am I telling you pull up
[57:19] the next one Redemption Redemption
[57:22] Redemption think of Redemption when
[57:25] we're sure we're gonna go to the symbols
[57:27] of the wars we're gonna go through the
[57:30] bowl and the crown was given and how to
[57:32] conquer and all those things but to me
[57:36] that's to show this is all remember this
[57:39] is all opposition this is not God in
[57:44] revelation 6:1 you understand I'm saying
[57:46] this is not God this is the devil and
[57:48] what he's doing
[57:50] but remember sealed up under that it's
[57:54] what God's already been doing all right
[57:57] you can't have a white horse oh why
[58:00] brother Brown said a white righteous
[58:01] seemingly a white Rogers Church there
[58:04] had to be a white Rogers Church on the
[58:05] earth for Satan to copy from a man there
[58:09] had to be a red of blood ball Church
[58:12] there had to be
[58:13] black there had to be all the different
[58:14] symbols because remember let's just read
[58:20] it
[58:20] this is my quote I couldn't find brother
[58:22] Brown say this but I'm going to say it
[58:23] this way the break in the seals are not
[58:25] necessary for the salt your shoulders
[58:28] redeemed by the new birth shed blood of
[58:29] Jesus cross at Calvary amen most people
[58:33] I'm telling you 99% of the people in
[58:36] Christendom since the day of Pentecost
[58:40] until today are not going to see the
[58:42] opening of the seals in its entirety
[58:44] hold on the men though they're gonna be
[58:47] a recipient of it hello unless the seals
[58:53] break to somebody and they become a new
[58:55] body on right here standing on this part
[58:57] then people in the sixth dimension are
[58:59] not coming here right so there are a
[59:02] recipient of the opening of the seal
[59:05] that's why I said not necessarily for
[59:06] the salt but remember their soul their
[59:09] soul is redeemed there there's redeemed
[59:11] as they'll ever be but their bodies on
[59:13] this side
[59:14] their souls over there their bodies on
[59:17] this side their bodies waiting for this
[59:20] earth to be redeemed and then what
[59:24] they're gonna step over here pick up
[59:27] their body 30 40 days then we're all
[59:31] gonna go we're going what we're not
[59:33] going up we're gonna step over another
[59:34] dimension I was thinking something the
[59:38] other day somebody was mentioning
[59:41] infinity the other day and I thought you
[59:43] know since the beginning of time how
[59:49] many children just children that's under
[59:51] the age of accountability have died are
[59:53] gonna be in heaven billions billions and
[59:57] then we say well the earth is
[59:59] four-fifths water and once you make them
[1:00:01] all land we can all fit what does it
[1:00:03] matter
[1:00:04] what does it matter if infinities
[1:00:06] infinity we're one dimension you can
[1:00:08] step in and they'd be ten billion people
[1:00:10] and you step right back over another
[1:00:11] dimension they'd still be in people then
[1:00:13] you step over in another dimension they
[1:00:15] stand being people this earth can hold
[1:00:17] an innumerable amount of people you step
[1:00:21] over another dimension I believe we'll
[1:00:22] be able to do that hey man I'm
[1:00:25] telling you that's what I see but look
[1:00:28] but we'll bring full fellowship in the
[1:00:31] manifestation because remember when
[1:00:36] those people went across the curtain of
[1:00:37] time sure they were in full fellowship
[1:00:40] with each other
[1:00:42] think about this Christ was not there in
[1:00:47] his person you understand I mean he was
[1:00:51] that is listen that is the person of
[1:00:53] Christ those people but I'm talking
[1:00:55] about the literal man the one we long to
[1:00:58] see how long to see my lover I long to
[1:01:01] see my husband the one that's slapped me
[1:01:05] about and kept me straight I want to see
[1:01:08] him I want to see the man that's done
[1:01:10] all this work but they didn't see him
[1:01:13] brother Bram said where's Jesus the
[1:01:16] angel said he's a little high that's
[1:01:20] where we want to go right there go see
[1:01:23] he's got a glorified body these people
[1:01:26] don't have a glorified body they got to
[1:01:28] do like he did he had to come back here
[1:01:30] to get his body come on
[1:01:34] right he had to come back here to get
[1:01:36] his body go that term is as empty that
[1:01:43] term is empty there's no flesh in there
[1:01:46] because it's now glorified in walking in
[1:01:50] all the dimension but it's not in a
[1:01:53] sixth dimension why because they're not
[1:02:00] complete
[1:02:02] they're not exactly they're not complete
[1:02:05] without coming back because he's
[1:02:07] standing somewhere in a flesh body flesh
[1:02:14] I'm from my flesh buddy eternal
[1:02:18] glorified and they're not there in an
[1:02:22] eternal soul amen
[1:02:25] but they're not totally redeemed hey man
[1:02:30] cuz they got to come back here and
[1:02:32] connect back to the earth amen
[1:02:36] get their glorified body step into it
[1:02:41] and then do like Jesus now listen Jesus
[1:02:44] walked 30 to 40 days in a glorified body
[1:02:47] on this earth in Satan's domain highly
[1:02:52] impossible the way we think it but
[1:02:57] remember with God all things are
[1:02:59] possible he walked through here for 30
[1:03:02] 40 days he communed with him he ate
[1:03:05] remember he even fixed fish for him on
[1:03:07] them on the shore we sing the song
[1:03:11] coming down he told him they were out
[1:03:14] there fishing he said coming down talk
[1:03:16] to Peter talk to him all told him what
[1:03:18] to do told him what was going on told
[1:03:20] him and then he laughed and he said in
[1:03:25] other words I'll not see you anymore the
[1:03:27] way you see me now but when you do see
[1:03:30] me we'll all be back together again
[1:03:32] and that's what we're doing now that's
[1:03:34] why we now are the hinge point of this
[1:03:36] whole thing we're the keystone of this
[1:03:39] whole thing
[1:03:40] that's why brother Branham had to bring
[1:03:42] the message here planted in our heart
[1:03:46] and then let the Holy Ghost work because
[1:03:51] remember you can grieve the Holy Ghost
[1:03:52] you you can have as much of God as you
[1:03:54] want he's not gonna open your brain I
[1:03:57] wish he'd opened my head up pour it in
[1:03:59] sometimes but you know what we couldn't
[1:04:03] stand it
[1:04:04] he knows the end from the beginning he
[1:04:07] knows what you can stand and what you
[1:04:09] can't stand
[1:04:12] so what are these seals it's to bring
[1:04:15] full fellowship into manifestation
[1:04:17] what in this dimension Cosi they didn't
[1:04:21] get it in that dimension they died and
[1:04:23] went on perfect and God complete in that
[1:04:28] dimension I said complete and they're
[1:04:30] not totally because they don't everybody
[1:04:31] but completing God that God said I'm
[1:04:33] finished with you on this in this
[1:04:34] dimension I'm done you're done you've
[1:04:37] done everything you can do now I'm gonna
[1:04:39] put you in a place of rest I'm gonna put
[1:04:44] you in a place of rest why do we grieve
[1:04:47] because people die why do we agree I
[1:04:50] know the separation in our mind and the
[1:04:52] and but that's all human that's the
[1:04:56] human emotion but the one just went on
[1:05:01] I'm sure we grieve when we cry and we
[1:05:04] wonder why but man to beat it's like
[1:05:07] brother Brown said he looked back and
[1:05:08] saw that saw that nasty he called it all
[1:05:11] kind of things
[1:05:12] what good right he said that corrupt he
[1:05:16] kept calling it yet he said why do I
[1:05:18] want to go back to that because he was
[1:05:21] over here in perfection but not full
[1:05:24] completion and not full fellowship
[1:05:27] because you know what you know what
[1:05:28] they're not sitting over there twiddling
[1:05:29] their thumbs no Gary Atkins is going
[1:05:33] what do you think about that yeah you
[1:05:36] always do that he woke up me go what do
[1:05:37] you think about that and him and Marlo's
[1:05:40] over there singing and you know they're
[1:05:42] doing things but you know what they're
[1:05:43] waiting they're not in a place of
[1:05:49] perfect rest they're in the place of
[1:05:51] rest
[1:05:52] the perfect rest is when we come back
[1:05:54] here and then we step over in another
[1:05:57] dimension
[1:05:58] let God clean this thing off and then
[1:06:01] we're gonna step back in the millennium
[1:06:03] and like I said what a holiday what a
[1:06:06] day when you don't have to worry about
[1:06:08] what's our problem right now if I were
[1:06:11] to preach till nine o'clock won't be a
[1:06:12] problem number want to be mean
[1:06:16] I've got make a list Julie make a list I
[1:06:20] got to pick up Luke I got I got right I
[1:06:23] got to make sure the and I got to cook
[1:06:27] and I write you would start thinking
[1:06:32] this is the things I got to do tomorrow
[1:06:34] but what about if you had none of that
[1:06:37] tomorrow never comes what a holiday sure
[1:06:42] out there even in that world the world
[1:06:44] we're gonna be living in it's gonna be
[1:06:45] going through time remember they got
[1:06:49] eleven thousand years day night day
[1:06:51] night day night right but you're not
[1:06:54] you're an eternal condition why because
[1:06:57] of what Christ did it Calvary but then
[1:07:00] you got to insert in between that that
[1:07:03] somebody come to a place that said I and
[1:07:08] my father are one and there's nothing
[1:07:12] gonna stop me from taking this body and
[1:07:16] saying Satan brother I'm said what death
[1:07:19] would what come up your sleeve and what
[1:07:22] would you do
[1:07:25] there's fear
[1:07:33] just like taking a little lint and
[1:07:36] pushing the lint off of your shoulder
[1:07:38] off of your off er see your we haven't
[1:07:44] come to believe that yet no some of you
[1:07:49] are going I feel so bad I may die
[1:07:53] tomorrow I'm 80 I'll be 58 in a couple
[1:07:56] of weeks I'm getting closer I'm getting
[1:08:00] closer to the door amen
[1:08:02] but within but with what it's our carnal
[1:08:06] mind that's why Jesus didn't have a
[1:08:07] carnal mind he wasn't birthed by a woman
[1:08:09] listen
[1:08:10] oh he come through a woman he had to to
[1:08:15] be a kinsman he had to do that but that
[1:08:17] woman had nothing to do with his
[1:08:20] conception nothing he was born from a
[1:08:24] man you want I'll bring that quote where
[1:08:28] brother Brian said if you're born of a
[1:08:29] woman you're dead if you're born of a
[1:08:30] man you live and that's profound but
[1:08:33] that's exactly what it is
[1:08:34] he told Nicodemus he said you must be
[1:08:37] born from above you must be born from a
[1:08:41] man because what's the first thing
[1:08:42] Nicodemus said he said I got to go back
[1:08:44] and get in my mama's womb he said
[1:08:45] natural you know what Jesus should have
[1:08:48] said he should turn around and said
[1:08:49] that's what killed you to start with are
[1:08:52] you gonna be double dead by the time you
[1:08:54] go do that you're gonna be double dead
[1:08:56] watch why he was saying he said I am the
[1:08:58] way the truth and the life what the man
[1:09:01] the male and that's what's happened then
[1:09:03] these sales we must see Jesus Christ to
[1:09:09] bring back full fellowship in the
[1:09:10] manifestation that's what God's waiting
[1:09:11] on he's waiting on us all right okay so
[1:09:17] let's look one minute at this list I'm
[1:09:20] not gonna bring the board out until next
[1:09:21] two Sundays from them but we see a white
[1:09:26] horse and we see a rider on that horse
[1:09:29] and why it is what purity just for a few
[1:09:33] minutes and then we'll stop that white
[1:09:35] horse is a symbol of purity right
[1:09:37] a white righteous whatever you want to
[1:09:40] call it
[1:09:41] and he rides true starts riding in the
[1:09:47] church ages gets on his white horse
[1:09:50] starts riding and rides through we say
[1:09:53] the first three Church ages which is
[1:09:55] correct that is the let me get my line
[1:10:01] ox man and Eagle so you got your lion
[1:10:02] your li o and you're lying what you've
[1:10:06] already got the lion there right the
[1:10:09] first date the first three ages is the
[1:10:10] lion age Li Knox man and Eagle first
[1:10:13] three ages is the lion the Ox is what
[1:10:17] that fourth age the dark ages the man is
[1:10:21] Wesley and Luther or Luthor and Wesley
[1:10:23] and then the Eagle is ours okay
[1:10:26] everybody got that okay but we'll draw
[1:10:29] it here but I want to just do this and
[1:10:30] then we'll just quit cuz we've done
[1:10:31] enough right now to kind of break the
[1:10:33] back the foundation back up but I want
[1:10:35] you to see though that that white horse
[1:10:37] that white horse was something he got on
[1:10:41] it was a beast it was a power right and
[1:10:48] who gave him the power the people a bow
[1:10:52] oh he could show the bow but he had no
[1:10:56] arrows they'd be like going hunting
[1:11:00] grizzly bear without a bullet that's a
[1:11:06] death wish but you know what
[1:11:09] you're not gonna Bluff the bear but he
[1:11:12] bluffed the people cuz he said I got
[1:11:15] this power right here but remember Satan
[1:11:18] can only show you so much he's kind of
[1:11:21] like a magician he shows you what he
[1:11:24] wants you to see and then he hides all
[1:11:26] the other stuff back here cuz he had no
[1:11:29] era to put in there to shoot anybody
[1:11:32] with but you saw the bow you saw what
[1:11:34] you saw the doctrine coming up you saw
[1:11:36] the the deeds of the Nicolaitans you saw
[1:11:39] the people come up and start going who
[1:11:42] was that
[1:11:42] Bob strength yes there right in whose
[1:11:45] age was that Irina's so you got Paul
[1:11:48] when Paul left here come Iranians and it
[1:11:50] was already a man saying Jesus was the
[1:11:52] like substance of God
[1:11:54] I mean man that's beginning of writing
[1:11:57] that what is it he said why Satan
[1:12:01] straddle that white horse and he took
[1:12:03] off what in the people telling the
[1:12:07] people telling the people that he was
[1:12:10] another substance of God he had a bow
[1:12:15] which is all these are all symbolic
[1:12:17] these are actors will read it next
[1:12:19] Sunday or two Sundays from now and a
[1:12:22] crown was given who crowned him brother
[1:12:24] Brown said the people crowned it and
[1:12:26] then what a crown was given by the
[1:12:29] people and what did he do through those
[1:12:32] first three ages look the first three
[1:12:34] ages was pure there was no denominations
[1:12:38] in the first three church ages but what
[1:12:40] was happening though there was a there
[1:12:42] was a seed planted there was little
[1:12:45] sayings in the corner kind of like the
[1:12:47] doctrines we see in the message you know
[1:12:49] he they try it out on people first a few
[1:12:53] then when they like it you know and it
[1:12:55] starts feeling good they go and they
[1:12:57] bring it to the board people then they
[1:12:59] bring in some more people like that
[1:13:01] Satan riding that same horse because
[1:13:03] brother Brown said that rider gets off
[1:13:05] that horse and that horse continues into
[1:13:07] eternity what he said that horse
[1:13:10] continues to ride that same doctrine
[1:13:13] that started in the first three ages is
[1:13:15] still going on today that's why it's got
[1:13:20] to be cut off the white horse is is
[1:13:23] beautiful that was a white righteous
[1:13:25] church here they didn't have a one guard
[1:13:27] problem they didn't have a water back
[1:13:29] then the problem they didn't have an
[1:13:30] eternal hell problem that developed
[1:13:34] though by during that age Satan got in
[1:13:37] and he just started weaving his way like
[1:13:39] a snake weaving his way through the
[1:13:41] people and just kind of going you know
[1:13:43] you ever thought about Jesus you know he
[1:13:45] he had to eat he bled wasn't he just
[1:13:49] like a human you know what Nia that's
[1:13:52] all you gotta do hate they say he talks
[1:13:55] to you he talks to me say why don't you
[1:13:59] think
[1:14:01] no I we don't we shouldn't think
[1:14:05] that's our problem but I'll promise you
[1:14:08] that white horse road through the church
[1:14:13] road through the real church he he wrote
[1:14:20] the wasn't it wasn't that he was in the
[1:14:22] bar he wasn't in the cat houses well
[1:14:26] call him back I was going to get out no
[1:14:29] he's in the church he's in church doing
[1:14:32] these thing same things now I fly one
[1:14:34] brother branham coming and showed us he
[1:14:36] said here stands a lamb and there goes a
[1:14:38] wild horse rider I was thinking about
[1:14:40] that this morning
[1:14:41] there's all things that are that we have
[1:14:43] in our life that that the word should
[1:14:45] win when the word comes then you should
[1:14:49] say Lord is that in me because it hides
[1:14:54] but is I didn't me yeah that's in you I
[1:14:58] preached will tell you that yeah that's
[1:15:00] in you he'll preach a sermon and you'll
[1:15:02] go man I need to what move over a little
[1:15:06] bit hey I need to stand here and let
[1:15:09] that thing go away that's what we're
[1:15:11] gonna start on these seals we need to
[1:15:13] know that we need to know for one thing
[1:15:14] that there is a lamb on the scene and
[1:15:17] man there's got to be a lamb in your
[1:15:19] life listen if it's the devil all the
[1:15:20] way than you know what you're gonna do
[1:15:22] you're gonna you're the one going in
[1:15:23] this direction but here stands a lamb
[1:15:26] with a book in his hand there goes a
[1:15:27] wireless rider that's why your new birth
[1:15:30] is the most important thing without the
[1:15:32] new birth guess what you'll think you're
[1:15:33] right you'll think you're right Satan
[1:15:36] thinks he's right and he will make you
[1:15:38] think you're right that's why that the
[1:15:41] seals has to tie in with a statue of a
[1:15:43] perfect man that's not the virtue of a
[1:15:45] human that's the virtue of God right
[1:15:49] that's not the knowledge of a human
[1:15:51] that's the knowledge of God hey man
[1:15:54] that's what's got to be born in you sure
[1:15:56] it's great to have knowledge I mean Joe
[1:15:58] was talking a few minutes ago
[1:16:00] we've known people with super knowledge
[1:16:03] come in to message and know all about
[1:16:05] the Jews and know all about this and all
[1:16:07] about that
[1:16:08] but then you start pinpointing their
[1:16:10] life and where do they go they ride off
[1:16:15] hello
[1:16:17] because they can't stand it when you
[1:16:19] start talking back to life they start
[1:16:22] riding off and then what they
[1:16:23] disappeared you don't see them anymore
[1:16:25] that's what I hate that's bothered me
[1:16:27] more than anything still bothers me but
[1:16:29] you know some things you got to get over
[1:16:32] it's not for everybody bro folks it's
[1:16:35] not let's stand it is not for everybody
[1:16:38] but it is for everybody you thought I'm
[1:16:47] gonna leave somebody out did you it's
[1:16:50] not for everybody but it is for
[1:16:52] everybody everybody that won't sit he'll
[1:16:56] give it and I pray this year that we'll
[1:16:58] want it more this year than we've ever
[1:17:00] wanted it before that well that will
[1:17:03] we'll get a crumb from the monsters
[1:17:05] table and you know what if you get a
[1:17:08] crumb and you're hungry a crumbs good
[1:17:12] but you know what it does it builds
[1:17:14] strength for you to go get some more and
[1:17:17] then maybe if you'll show yourself
[1:17:20] worthy the maestro lets you sit at the
[1:17:22] table right and he'll let you eat a
[1:17:24] bunch of bread and a bunch of meat I was
[1:17:28] talking to a preacher the other day and
[1:17:30] he was talking about somebody preaching
[1:17:34] and I told him I was telling my brother
[1:17:36] Chris I said yeah I like to eat meat I
[1:17:38] like vegetable but I like to eat me God
[1:17:43] made me a meat eater he gave me teeth so
[1:17:46] I could eat me in the gospel and in the
[1:17:50] natural somebody said a few minutes ago
[1:17:53] said you like animals I said yeah I love
[1:17:55] them with vegetable but remember Eagles
[1:18:01] don't eat turnips
[1:18:04] come sleep ain't nothing wrong with
[1:18:07] turnips don't like them but Eagles don't
[1:18:09] eat turnips they meet cuz they're made
[1:18:14] for that and that's this age we're made
[1:18:17] to eat me we thrive off of me oh sure
[1:18:21] it's it's nice to eat potatoes every
[1:18:23] once in a while
[1:18:26] and you know what you won't starve but
[1:18:30] you won't be completely satisfied either
[1:18:32] because complete satisfaction is what
[1:18:34] we're heading to in the headstone
[1:18:36] because like I said now the pieces are
[1:18:39] together the head and the body is
[1:18:41] getting ready to unite this it's never
[1:18:43] been on earth before sure we were in
[1:18:46] Christ the bride was in Christ but we
[1:18:49] could not work he couldn't work he only
[1:18:54] worked whatever he could write he didn't
[1:18:59] work the way he wanted to that's why
[1:19:01] sometimes he gets us ready said do you
[1:19:03] now believe he'd say and he did one time
[1:19:07] he said lord of mercy what's wrong with
[1:19:09] you people
[1:19:10] right he told me so what's wrong with
[1:19:13] you do you now believe but you know what
[1:19:18] he knew that he had to go to Calvary to
[1:19:22] get us out we were there but we could
[1:19:26] not work like we were supposed to work
[1:19:27] but once he came back on the day of
[1:19:30] Pentecost he said I am pleased to dwell
[1:19:33] in these church ages but right there to
[1:19:37] end I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna
[1:19:40] unite with what I started with all that
[1:19:44] we built up I'm gonna sit down and we're
[1:19:47] gonna get out of here that's the only
[1:19:48] way we're gonna get out of here hey man
[1:19:50] let's sing a song number eight inspire
[1:19:58] bullet list

[1:20:48] dark may be the night but I was late
[1:20:52] more close to here you give me like
[1:20:56] Saint snared me makes my soul turn my
[1:21:00] daughter's life but my Lord goes ahead
[1:21:05] every time though I want to see and look
[1:21:10] upon his face there to sing forever
[1:21:16] saving grace my board cares all planets
[1:21:25] all my life never to rejoice waiting
[1:21:30] Bally's Lord Lord for the bounty high
[1:21:34] and behold my Savior there
[1:21:39] with a dinner hand up straight for the
[1:21:43] by lilo he's guiding me I can see the
[1:21:49] word go oh I want to see him look upon
[1:21:55] his face they're saying Morris
[1:21:59] the saving rate on the streets of glory
[1:22:05] my boys cares all packs on my last day
[1:22:10] we rejoice when before me billows rise
[1:22:15] from the mighty then the borderless my

[1:22:30] friend to me love is oh oh
[1:22:35] to see if look upon his face there to
[1:22:40] say forever
[1:22:42] of its saving grace on the streets of
[1:22:46] glory
[1:22:52] ever Terry George you know we've looked
[1:22:58] through seven Church ages we've had two
[1:23:03] were to God and we've looked a man we've
[1:23:06] looked we've looked right at him in the
[1:23:10] word and we build an image in our mind
[1:23:14] of what he might look like because even
[1:23:16] brother Branham said that's the closest
[1:23:19] but remember Adam knows exactly what he
[1:23:25] looks like right Adam saw him face to
[1:23:29] face now we know all the other ones did
[1:23:32] which was after Adam but when Adam in
[1:23:34] God there was no fear just like me in
[1:23:37] Louie's talking together he said hey Dad
[1:23:38] how you doing I mean they were they were
[1:23:40] right here
[1:23:42] see that's the first Adam but he lost
[1:23:45] that and sure we saw Jesus they saw
[1:23:49] Jesus in a flesh body but he got older
[1:23:53] then then there was a miracle happened
[1:23:56] when he resurrected then Marian the ones
[1:23:59] finally saw him maybe the way they were
[1:24:04] supposed to see because remember Mary
[1:24:07] said what have you done with Jesus right
[1:24:10] they know what she said what are you
[1:24:11] done with him and then when he said Mary
[1:24:14] she knew but still stay looking I want
[1:24:17] to Peter went fishing they all did
[1:24:19] different things I was like what really
[1:24:21] they didn't believe the way they should
[1:24:23] have believed a man because you know
[1:24:28] what there wasn't a Holy Ghost anchor in
[1:24:29] their soul but now on the day of
[1:24:33] Pentecost Peter James John they all
[1:24:36] looked back and said we missed it I know
[1:24:40] they did I know they just I know that's
[1:24:42] why they cried I would have cried for a
[1:24:43] month we missed it he was standing
[1:24:46] remember what was it when I'm John Owen
[1:24:48] said we held we held the God of glory
[1:24:52] we hugged his neck and we missed him
[1:24:55] listen can it feel happen
[1:24:58] can it still happen that we miss it but
[1:25:03] all they somebody gonna see it there's
[1:25:05] somebody gonna see it but listen we're
[1:25:08] not gonna say it like we say it in the
[1:25:10] Millennium we're gonna be standing there
[1:25:12] face to face with a God created you with
[1:25:19] a God that brought you out and created
[1:25:22] what you stand in him and he's gonna
[1:25:24] look at you say well done my good and
[1:25:28] faithful servant I couldn't be right
[1:25:30] there with you
[1:25:30] but I was in you and you get a work I
[1:25:35] let's preach now so there no I want to
[1:25:40] see him but we got to see him in a word
[1:25:42] first we got to see him in each other
[1:25:46] and then we're gonna see him face to
[1:25:48] face think about Adam though what a
[1:25:53] privilege I mean all that stuff was new
[1:25:55] brother that God had created the world
[1:25:57] the stars were brand new earth was brand
[1:26:01] new even though it's been billions of
[1:26:04] years old what does it matter it was
[1:26:05] brand new to Adam cuz when he started
[1:26:06] walking on the earth and then this guy
[1:26:08] walks up and said I'm your Creator and
[1:26:11] he goes you must because we look just a
[1:26:14] lot then he said I'm lonely I'm lonely
[1:26:22] he's still saying today I'm lonely I'm
[1:26:26] lonely I wonder what I want to embrace
[1:26:29] something hey
[1:26:33] embrace this word first and it'll take
