[0:00] as we are Lord and we just ask you
[0:02] father that we just first of all just
[0:04] thank you Lord for for the another
[0:06] opportunity to serve you Lord father we
[0:09] just pray Lord that you'd have your way
[0:11] in this Sunday school lesson and and
[0:13] speak to our hearts Lord and you be our
[0:16] uh you be our portion this morning Lord
[0:18] we we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[0:22] amen amen's try this
[0:26] again all right all right so so we want
[0:30] to talk this morning about losing
[0:32] control so he can be in
[0:34] control all right because sometimes we
[0:37] go into freak uh control freak mode and
[0:41] we think that we have to have our hands
[0:43] on in everything and and what you're
[0:46] doing really is you're doing wrong you
[0:49] end up messing up stuff is really what
[0:51] you're doing but let's let's let's look
[0:53] at Sarah and Abraham's uh uh
[0:56] impatience uh and it's interesting that
[0:58] brother Brandon was just talking about
[0:59] that in what we were just listening to
[1:02] that God had given Abraham in in in
[1:05] Genesis chapter 5 of I'm sorry about
[1:08] Genesis 6 I meant 16 uh Genesis chapter
[1:12] 15 God had clearly given Abraham the um
[1:17] the promise that he was going to have a
[1:18] son and he gave him everything he even
[1:22] he even Vindicated that to
[1:24] him and then yet uh he goes and tells
[1:27] his wife and uh you know time passes and
[1:32] and uh uh Here Comes Sarah she gets
[1:35] impatient she thinks that she's got to
[1:37] make it happen some way
[1:39] somehow and you know the mess that it
[1:42] that it got in so so just real quick
[1:44] just just to read the word it says now
[1:46] Sarah Abra Abram's wife be him no
[1:49] children and and he had an an handmade
[1:52] an Egyptian whose name was Hagar and so
[1:55] so he she looked at Hagar there's my
[1:57] solution right there instead of waiting
[1:59] for God Amen that's what we do we here's
[2:03] our solution anything that's convenient
[2:05] to go ahead and grab that's right in
[2:07] front of us there that's our solution
[2:09] right there and then that's that's
[2:11] that's our our control freak uh uh you
[2:15] know that we have in us that we got to
[2:19] just make everything and and in reality
[2:21] when you when you do that and you don't
[2:24] delegate things properly you end up a
[2:28] you end up in a and mess yourself you
[2:31] see and you end up also doing others a
[2:35] disservice because they don't learn how
[2:38] to be responsible themselves as well you
[2:41] see when you try to take control of
[2:43] everything yourself amen so and Sarah
[2:47] said unto Abram behold now the Lord hath
[2:49] restrained from bearing I pray so she
[2:52] brings in the problem I pray thee go in
[2:55] unto my maid so she brings in the
[2:57] solution she
[2:58] thinks my maid it may be that I may
[3:01] obtain children by
[3:03] her so she's interpreting now what what
[3:06] she thinks God was trying to tell her
[3:08] tell him and that's when we get in
[3:11] trouble amen when we try to bring in our
[3:13] own interpretation on things and Abram
[3:17] hearkened to the voice of
[3:20] Sarah and Sarah Abram's wife took Hagar
[3:23] her maiden the Egyptian after Abram had
[3:26] dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan and
[3:28] gave her to to to her husband Abram to
[3:31] be his wife and he went in unto a Hagar
[3:34] and she conceived and when she saw that
[3:37] she had conceived her mistress was
[3:40] despised in her eyes so she conceives
[3:43] there's the solution right there that's
[3:46] exactly what God wanted but then when
[3:48] she conceives the Bible says her
[3:50] mistress was despised In Her Eyes in
[3:52] other words hear started looking at at
[3:55] at at Sarah like see I got a child and
[3:59] you don't
[4:00] I was able to conceive and now you don't
[4:03] and so that then becomes a problem in
[4:05] Sarah's eyes and Sarah said unto Abraham
[4:09] my wrong be upon
[4:11] thee now she's blaming it on on on
[4:15] Abraham her decision that she made you
[4:19] know trying to control things now she's
[4:21] putting the blame on on on Abraham so
[4:24] you were the one who did it but she was
[4:26] the one who said to said to do it right
[4:29] Abraham was just doing what she you know
[4:31] like you know some some of us husbands
[4:33] you know we we do just make sure that
[4:35] there's peace in the
[4:36] [Laughter]
[4:38] house you know just for the sake of
[4:40] Peace so that she can realize okay she
[4:43] was in the
[4:45] wrong amen that's what we do things
[4:48] sometimes but then sometimes you know
[4:50] you have to put your foot down amen cuz
[4:53] you are the head of the house but there
[4:56] is a place where God told Abraham
[4:58] hearken to your wife Sarah right right
[5:00] so Sarah wasn't always wrong in
[5:03] everything man sometimes us husbands we
[5:05] think that we got to you do it my way or
[5:08] else and that's not how it goes so the
[5:12] Bible says that she is your help meet
[5:15] and other words she can give input as
[5:17] well she has almost just as much wisdom
[5:20] as as we do husbands sometimes because
[5:23] they can put their hands in multiple
[5:25] things where we are only created us men
[5:28] to just concentrate on one thing at a
[5:30] time I'm certainly that way I can't do
[5:33] multiple things at one time I'm sitting
[5:35] there driving and my wife's talking to
[5:36] me but I'm thinking about Sunday school
[5:38] lesson this morning and and she's like
[5:40] you you didn't hear what I said or I'll
[5:42] respond to what she said you know about
[5:45] two minutes later are you just now
[5:48] processing what I just said two minutes
[5:51] ago and that's just how we uh us men are
[5:55] we can't tackle but one thing at a time
[5:57] but see that's the thing God made us
[5:59] that way and so we have to accept the
[6:02] fact that you are going to frustrate
[6:05] yourself trying to make everything
[6:08] happen all at one time when in reality
[6:10] you were not made that way right all
[6:13] right else we can't do that because
[6:16] you're going to frustrate yourself and
[6:18] then in the fact that you're frustrating
[6:20] yourself you're going to end up
[6:21] frustrating others around you because
[6:24] they see you frustrated and they see you
[6:27] upset right oo it's going getting down a
[6:30] little down to the home level this
[6:32] morning huh but that's good and Sarah
[6:35] said unto AB my wrong be upon thee I
[6:37] gave I have given my maid into thy bosom
[6:41] and when she saw that she had
[6:44] conceived I was despised In Her Eyes the
[6:46] lord judge between me and thee but
[6:48] Abraham said unto Sarah behold I made is
[6:51] in thy hand do to her as it pleaseth
[6:53] thee and when Sarah dealt hardly with
[6:55] her she fled from her face so that's
[6:58] what it caused her her her her wanting
[7:01] to take control of the situation that's
[7:04] what it end up causing it it it it it it
[7:07] caused a a a a stress in that in that
[7:11] relationship where she had to end up
[7:13] being hard on on on on Hagar and end up
[7:18] sending her
[7:19] away and and many times it happens like
[7:22] that to us when you think you have
[7:24] control of everything but in reality in
[7:27] your control freak mode that you're in
[7:30] and I know that sounds a bit harsh but
[7:31] that's what we are sometimes we're
[7:34] Control Freaks and we think that if it's
[7:36] not done our way then it can't be done
[7:38] in it's my way or the highway and that's
[7:41] not how it works that's not how it works
[7:44] amen so I like this right here because
[7:48] if you think about it this way it as I
[7:51] as I have written here it says the more
[7:53] you fear about losing control the more
[7:57] you want to be in control
[8:00] and the more you are in control the more
[8:03] you fear about losing control so it's a
[8:06] NeverEnding cycle and you see people who
[8:09] who have that mentality about wanting to
[8:11] control everything and about wanting to
[8:13] just take control it's my way or no way
[8:17] they don't know that they're that way
[8:19] just like the gossiper doesn't know that
[8:21] he's a gossiper or that or that or that
[8:24] the liar doesn't know that he or she is
[8:26] a liar they think it's just okay that's
[8:29] just the way I roll but in reality
[8:32] you're hurting others around you with
[8:34] your control freak trying to take
[8:36] control of everything amen you see it's
[8:40] a dangerous cycle that you're going
[8:42] around and around amen because what you
[8:45] think you're controlling is actually
[8:47] controlling
[8:49] you what you think you're controlling is
[8:52] actually controlling you and you don't
[8:54] know
[8:55] it right but other people around you
[8:58] they St they see
[9:00] it and because you're such a control
[9:02] freak they might not say anything to you
[9:04] out of fear but it's hurting you in the
[9:07] long run it's hurting you in the long
[9:10] run look what brother random says here
[9:11] and taking sides with Jesus and I
[9:14] believe that all these things has a time
[9:16] of lingering waiting but it's waiting
[9:19] for a time for the scripture to be
[9:22] fulfilled till everything gets gets
[9:26] right everything in order waiting many
[9:29] many times we get impatient like a
[9:31] child we great get great anticipations
[9:35] and many times jump way ahead and that
[9:39] just hinders the work that just hinders
[9:42] the work until the work gets caught up
[9:44] see we must just move reverently have a
[9:48] purpose in heart that God if he would
[9:51] desire to use us in such and such but
[9:54] wait till he makes the opening cuz he
[9:58] has to go ahead of of us
[10:00] amen we want Jesus Christ to lead us
[10:03] amen we don't want to lead him amen he
[10:06] knows the way he is the head we are the
[10:10] body and the body follows wherever the
[10:12] head goes amen so so so he knows the
[10:17] best for us and and and so you know us
[10:22] as as parents uh I've been there we try
[10:27] to take control of of of of our children
[10:29] in such a way when we think that
[10:31] monitoring everything they do and and
[10:34] and looking at every single Instagram
[10:36] post they have or or who are they
[10:38] talking to and and and we think that
[10:40] that we're are in control and in reality
[10:44] we're hurting them in reality they end
[10:47] up
[10:48] rebelling and then you're you you you
[10:51] you're wondering what just happened you
[10:53] know what just happened they don't want
[10:54] to serve the Lord they don't it's
[10:56] because of your control actions
[10:59] that probably just rubbed them the wrong
[11:01] way and really what teenagers are asking
[11:04] for is they want they want for you to
[11:07] have confidence in them that's right now
[11:11] I know that there's things you know that
[11:12] that you have to definitely put your
[11:14] foot down your your your your teen comes
[11:17] to the house with with weed or or or or
[11:19] or you know or cracked in a bag or
[11:22] something like that you know you got to
[11:24] put your foot down on something is you
[11:26] can't just say well I'll let them sort
[11:28] it out you know no you ain't going to
[11:30] have crack in my
[11:31] house you ain't going to have crack
[11:33] pipes in my house you ain't going to
[11:35] have no you see and if you're going to
[11:38] you the door is right there right cuz
[11:41] this is a home dedicated to the Lord but
[11:45] sometimes we think you know that you
[11:46] know we're looking in every drawer in
[11:48] their in their room and we're looking in
[11:49] everything you know give them uh some
[11:53] leway because in reality that's what
[11:55] ends up making them your friend in in
[11:58] the long run
[11:59] they want to be your friend and they
[12:01] want but they they can only be your
[12:03] friend and have confidence in you if you
[12:06] have some confidence in
[12:08] them right it works both ways and I know
[12:13] some of us we've learned that the hard
[12:16] way I have too but that that that that
[12:20] that is how it works because you know as
[12:23] a a teenager they're becoming adults and
[12:26] what is you as an adult what do you want
[12:28] you want people people to have
[12:29] confidence in you you want people to
[12:31] trust you and not people to be over you
[12:34] controlling you and and and making sure
[12:37] that that that you know that that rubs
[12:40] you the wrong way doesn't it you see so
[12:43] it does the same thing with a teenager
[12:46] so we have to be careful with that
[12:49] amen and in Ecclesiastes chapter 3: 1
[12:52] through 8 I'm not going to read it all
[12:54] but the Bible says to everything there
[12:56] is a a season is right to everything
[13:00] there is a season there is and a time to
[13:04] every purpose under under Heaven amen a
[13:07] time to be born a time to die a time to
[13:10] plant and a time to pluck up that which
[13:13] is planted brother way knows that very
[13:15] clearly you know where he does the
[13:17] garden there's a time to plant but when
[13:20] you plant something you can't rush
[13:23] it there is no way for you to rush it I
[13:26] mean you can maybe put some some
[13:28] nitrogen or some vitamins to the to the
[13:30] soil but but you have to let uh nature
[13:34] take its course and then you will be
[13:37] able to grab and and get what you sowed
[13:41] you will reap what you sow when you let
[13:44] it come out you see when you have
[13:47] patience amen and it's going to produce
[13:50] what it what it says it's going to
[13:51] produce
[13:54] amen all right so you don't always have
[13:57] to have the power uh you don't always
[14:00] have the power to
[14:02] control but you always have the power to
[14:07] surrender all right listen to that you
[14:10] don't have the power to control but you
[14:12] always have the power to surrender
[14:14] because surrendering is an Act of
[14:17] Faith right surrendering is an Act of
[14:21] Faith as I as I have written up
[14:24] there is having faith in what God Said
[14:28] in his word word amen that he's going to
[14:30] take care of what he promised he would
[14:33] so if Sarah would have done that amen
[14:36] when Abraham received the promise and
[14:38] Abraham went to Sarah and said listen
[14:40] God told me this that she should have
[14:42] said like Mary said be it unto me
[14:45] according to Thy word to Thy word and I
[14:49] and I think things would have would have
[14:50] would have would have been different for
[14:52] Sarah and her family
[14:54] right but we know that there was there
[14:56] had to be an ishmail to come forth and
[14:59] and all that so God fulfills his purpose
[15:01] in many different ways but but if if we
[15:04] were just do that amen that that uh be
[15:08] it unto me according to Thy word Lord
[15:10] amen that is an Act of Faith
[15:12] Mary Mary at the age that she was in 15
[15:16] 16 years old amen very in inexperienced
[15:20] in her life uh she just wanted to be
[15:22] married and have a husband just like any
[15:24] everybody else she wanted to you know
[15:27] have a you know nice donkey at parked in
[15:30] the front in the in the in the front you
[15:32] know of the house you know of the you
[15:34] know not not something you know too
[15:36] extravagant you know but you know a nice
[15:38] donkey you know parked right there a
[15:39] little maybe a little Chariot maybe
[15:42] maybe uh she was thinking about all
[15:45] these
[15:46] things and then the angel comes to her
[15:49] and tells her you're going to have a
[15:52] child and it's not going to be by
[15:55] Joseph but God shall overshadow you the
[15:58] holy Holy Spirit Will overshadow
[16:00] you and all she could say was Lord be it
[16:05] unto me according to what you're saying
[16:08] right didn't have to understand it
[16:11] all amen sometimes we don't have to
[16:14] understand it all amen and just release
[16:17] and let God have his way amen praise God
[16:20] Amen see our desire to control what is
[16:23] it rooted in it's rooted in the lack of
[16:27] faith our desire to control is rooted in
[16:30] lack of faith our desire to control
[16:33] people is rooted in the lack of faith in
[16:35] those people but they're supposed to be
[16:38] children of God just like you filled
[16:41] with the Holy Ghost don't you think that
[16:43] God can work through them just as he
[16:44] works through you don't you think that
[16:47] God can steer them amen when if God's in
[16:49] control of the whole thing of the whole
[16:51] matter why can't God you work with with
[16:55] with other people but you see you have
[16:57] to put your your your your your your
[16:59] your thing in it and then that's when
[17:02] that's when the things get messed up and
[17:05] that's when people why are people treat
[17:06] me this way why are people looking at me
[17:09] that way it's because you put your
[17:11] trying to put your own thing into it you
[17:15] see and so that it's because it's a lack
[17:17] of faith it's a lack of faith that that
[17:20] God's program isn't complete unless I do
[17:23] something about
[17:25] it and that's that's that's God God God
[17:30] uh God doesn't like that we do that
[17:35] amen if it's going to be up if it's
[17:38] going to be it's up to me it's what you
[17:41] say I've got to be strong I got to make
[17:43] it happen I got to manipulate
[17:46] it and it doesn't work that way
[17:50] amen I hope those that that still don't
[17:53] have children I hope I hope you listen
[17:55] and take
[17:57] note hey amen it doesn't at the
[18:00] beginning see when you're f with your
[18:02] first child you have uh everything every
[18:06] you know my mom my mom with with me I
[18:08] was her first son I was her first child
[18:12] and she
[18:13] would every I mean anything that I
[18:15] picked up from the floor she would just
[18:18] I mean she wash it you know and wash my
[18:21] mouth and then and and and she would she
[18:23] would uh uh boil
[18:26] everything because she was a mother for
[18:29] the first time and she thought that that
[18:31] that's what but in reality what she was
[18:32] doing she was actually doing me more
[18:34] harm she didn't know that at the time
[18:37] and then and I say this she because
[18:39] she'll tell you this because kids need
[18:43] germs kids need bacteria kids need to
[18:46] get dirty kids need the floor and the
[18:48] dirt and all
[18:50] that but then when the second one came
[18:52] my sister Sandra you know she's back
[18:54] there she she was a little bit more
[18:57] loose after that
[18:59] and then with my third sister Deanna she
[19:01] was really loose then she didn't care
[19:03] and they turned out just fine in reality
[19:07] you know I it it you know and out of and
[19:11] when I was younger I was I was a little
[19:13] bit more sick you know I had I had
[19:15] asthma issues and things like
[19:17] that and she she she'll ask she'll tell
[19:20] you she said I just wonder if all that
[19:22] stuff that I tried to do thinking that I
[19:24] was doing something good it really was
[19:26] harming you and so so you see uh so
[19:30] again another lesson for those who are
[19:32] not parents yet let your par let your
[19:34] kids play with
[19:37] dirt let them get dirty let them learn
[19:39] lessons amen let them learn lessons and
[19:42] I say the same thing amen let people
[19:45] make mistakes sometimes so that they can
[19:48] learn okay I won't do that
[19:51] again amen why God wants to give us keys
[19:55] right when in adoption he wants to give
[19:57] us the keys right amen praise the Lord
[20:00] but sometimes we we we we think no we
[20:02] have to hold the keys the whole time and
[20:04] that person is mature enough to handle
[20:07] that situation to handle that that that
[20:10] project that you you you give them you
[20:12] see to handle that they can do it just
[20:16] pray for them and let let them let them
[20:18] loose because I promise you amen when
[20:20] you let people loose their
[20:22] creativity Sparks open that's right amen
[20:26] and they'll come and do things amen that
[20:28] you don't think that is in them right
[20:31] and it opens up
[20:33] amen I've seen it amen in the workplace
[20:36] I've seen it you know with my children
[20:39] I've seen it amen let them something
[20:41] that they're interested in and then it
[20:43] opens up amen and it just Sparks
[20:46] creativity like like nothing you're like
[20:48] wow this come out better than what I
[20:50] thought it was why because you
[20:52] surrendered you surrendered and you took
[20:55] off your control freak
[20:57] robe and you let them be amen and you
[21:00] know what and you'll be more tranquil
[21:02] that way you'll have more peace in your
[21:04] heart that's right and you'll have more
[21:06] peace and peace of mind and you'll have
[21:09] more peace with God yes amen praise the
[21:13] Lord and so see that goes against
[21:16] completely amen trying to be trying
[21:18] trying to have control of everything it
[21:19] goes completely what Jesus said here in
[21:21] Matthew 16 he says then said Jesus unto
[21:23] his disciples If any man will come after
[21:26] me let him deny himself
[21:28] in other words forget your ideas and
[21:31] take up his cross and follow me amen for
[21:34] whosoever will save his life amen shall
[21:38] lose
[21:39] it right and whosoever will lose his
[21:43] life for my sake shall find it amen so I
[21:48] want to be a loser this
[21:50] morning so that I can win him amen I
[21:55] want to be a loser no I don't want to be
[21:56] a loser I do in this case I want to lose
[22:00] myself my control freak robe amen so
[22:04] that he can take control so I can find
[22:06] life and I can find peace Amen in in in
[22:10] the projects and the things that I'm
[22:12] doing
[22:13] Amen to fully follow Jesus is to
[22:15] surrender control right amen because why
[22:19] he surrendered control on the cross yes
[22:22] he
[22:23] totally in the father's hand right
[22:27] hanging on a cross
[22:29] naked and and and and in the way that he
[22:32] was totally his body totally messed up
[22:35] amen CU he surrendered to him amen so
[22:39] there's either 100% surrender or no
[22:41] surrender at all there there's no
[22:43] partial surrender amen there's no Midway
[22:47] surrender you either 100% surrendered or
[22:51] or or not surrender at all amen
[22:55] surrendering control is not a one a one
[22:58] time thing it's a continual process it's
[23:01] a continual process amen first Peter
[23:04] says humble yourselves therefore unto
[23:06] the mighty hand of God that he may exalt
[23:09] you in due time casting all your care
[23:12] upon
[23:14] him but what we'd like to put there is
[23:18] himself or ourself casting all the Care
[23:21] upon
[23:23] ourself because I care for myself and
[23:26] that's not how it works
[23:28] you're hurting
[23:29] yourself don't hurt yourself especially
[23:32] those of you who are getting
[23:34] older you don't need more burdens your
[23:37] body's already wearing down don't need
[23:40] more burdens amen amen I you know the
[23:44] more the more I see it you know my kids
[23:47] and and you know they're going to do
[23:49] what they want to do in
[23:52] reality right I can't control every
[23:55] single aspect I can't password lock and
[23:58] and everything in the house I can't I
[24:01] I'll do my best to do so amen if there's
[24:04] things that come in the house there are
[24:05] not supposed to be there I'll address
[24:07] them but there's I can't control every
[24:09] single thing they view they're going to
[24:11] be exposed to things in this life
[24:13] they're eventually they're going to be
[24:15] exposed of anyways so so might as well
[24:18] you know just okay what do you think
[24:20] about that so you're listening to
[24:22] hip-hop music what do you think about
[24:24] that what what do you think about that
[24:26] song
[24:28] and I'll let God take care of the of
[24:31] them amen because when he does it it
[24:33] does it it's complete all right if they
[24:37] do it just because I tell them to then
[24:40] eventually they'll come back around to
[24:41] it again and do it again because it's
[24:43] not out of them by but when we let God
[24:46] take control amen all right last verse
[24:48] here wherefore seeing we also compassed
[24:51] about it with so great a cloud of
[24:52] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[24:55] and the sin which do so easily beset us
[24:58] and let us run with patience amen the
[25:01] race that is set before us looking unto
[25:04] Jesus amen looking unto
