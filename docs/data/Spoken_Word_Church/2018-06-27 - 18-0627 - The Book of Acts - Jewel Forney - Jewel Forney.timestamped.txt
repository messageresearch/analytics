[0:10] god bless y'all
[0:13] it's almost either June's birthday
[0:15] coming up in July second and it's her
[0:17] fourth birthday and I like to make it a
[0:18] point every year to remind y'all about
[0:20] the trial we went through because it's
[0:22] our nature as humans to forget you know
[0:23] as as people we forget the things Lords
[0:27] done for us so I wanted to remind you
[0:28] all of that that we went through that
[0:30] trial most of you know about it if you
[0:32] haven't seen it you can get the
[0:34] testimony downstairs and by the Richards
[0:36] office but Richard Roberts office
[0:38] there's a Seabee rack the testimony DVD
[0:41] is still available down there for some
[0:43] of the new ones that have come along but
[0:45] basically when she was born she had a
[0:48] pretty mature lung condition she was
[0:49] premature and we thought it was a minor
[0:52] thing and by her third day of her life
[0:54] she was born Wednesday night on Saturday
[0:56] night she was almost dead and Saturday
[1:00] night we left her thinking that she
[1:03] would be dead when we got back we was
[1:05] really low and we left her went to the
[1:07] bough statement came back she was still
[1:09] alive but that number that we kept
[1:10] watching for all that time that the
[1:12] doctors were concerned about that oxygen
[1:15] saturation which is the oxygen in the
[1:17] blood was down to 37% when we got back
[1:19] and then we left and went home but her
[1:21] other kids to bed they called and said
[1:23] we've got to send her to Egleston
[1:25] because there's no more we can do for
[1:26] her at Northeast Georgia now Northeast
[1:28] Georgia is a pretty high ranking medical
[1:30] facility and that was my big concern
[1:32] that was alarming that they would call
[1:33] in the middle of the night and instead
[1:35] there's no more we can do so then the
[1:37] center to Atlanta and then on the way
[1:39] down that's when the paramedic or nurse
[1:41] whatever working on her said that we
[1:43] nearly lost her baby twice during the
[1:45] transport she nearly died twice and then
[1:48] when they got down there the doctor
[1:50] Karpin medicine said your baby's dying
[1:51] we had this procedure we can cut her
[1:53] jugular vein open and stick a tube down
[1:56] in her heart to bypass the function of
[1:58] the lungs put oxygen in the blood that's
[2:02] the last resort so they never had to do
[2:04] that and we went to church that Sunday
[2:06] morning and came back down there to see
[2:08] her again and she would have started
[2:09] turning around
[2:10] so 30 days later which was a month old
[2:13] and she came home about a half a million
[2:15] dollar baby I thank God for health
[2:17] insurance but anyway and then this
[2:20] testimony today is about EULA not IVA
[2:24] can you pull up the picture brother Joe
[2:26] for the bulb so EULA when she was two
[2:29] and three years old she around that time
[2:31] she had frequent seizures they call him
[2:33] febrile seizures where she had a would
[2:35] have a fever
[2:36] it was spiked and caused her to go into
[2:38] a seizure and it was no big deal
[2:40] we saw her house so many of them it kind
[2:42] of became a normal thing we took it at
[2:44] the doctor they never could diagnose the
[2:46] problem we finally quit taking taking
[2:48] her to the doctor in over two years she
[2:50] hasn't had a single seizure eventually
[2:54] well now about a month ago on a Monday
[2:57] she had a seizure totally out of the
[2:59] blue and no fever as we could tell
[3:02] associated with it I had been working
[3:05] all night Sunday night came home midday
[3:07] Monday about like usual gaving I went
[3:09] upstairs to fold laundry listen to a
[3:11] sermon I kid you not my finger was
[3:13] falling - press play on a sermon and
[3:15] that's when chaos broke loose downstairs
[3:19] that's how the devil works you know he's
[3:21] completely against the revelation of the
[3:23] word that we possessed he don't want us
[3:24] to hear the word and so forth well this
[3:27] was not a normal screen this was mercy
[3:29] and harmony and Abba screaming at the
[3:31] top of their lungs totally fearful
[3:33] totally afraid and and something had
[3:35] just terrified them and they were
[3:37] calling out ulah ulah ulah so we went
[3:39] running down the stairs to meet them and
[3:41] found Yulin a seizure well that's no big
[3:43] deal nothing unusual except it's been
[3:46] over two and a half years since she had
[3:48] one and there was also no fever
[3:50] associated with this one whenever they
[3:52] get that picture up you'll see how
[3:53] normal she looked I happened to take a
[3:55] picture right before she had this
[3:56] seizure not knowing that she was gonna
[3:58] have a seizure I took a picture because
[3:59] she's cute found out then that I could
[4:02] use it in the testimony just to show you
[4:04] how normal she looked this was a very
[4:06] abnormal case all right and she was laid
[4:10] back in this chair that you'll see in
[4:12] the picture no I didn't take a picture
[4:13] during the seizure okay it's kind of
[4:15] weird she was laid back in the chair I
[4:17] was rolled back and saliva and blood
[4:19] coming out of her mouth and not
[4:21] breathing now that was the abnormal
[4:23] thing
[4:24] it had been normal for us to see her
[4:25] have a seizure but I don't recall her
[4:26] breathing ever stopping before so that
[4:30] was the concerning part and what took
[4:32] place next week went over there to ER
[4:35] and laid hands on her and prayed and saw
[4:37] the Lord cast that demon off of her and
[4:40] she came back started breathing again
[4:42] and was perfectly normal and eventually
[4:44] she revived him she was still
[4:46] unconscious for a little while after
[4:48] that but finally she revived that was
[4:49] probably 40 minutes before the seizure
[4:51] and she laid over in that chair and I
[4:54] was so sure that she was choking because
[4:56] of the lack of breathing once I ruled
[4:58] that out though I later on the floor and
[5:00] we pray now on the spiritual aspect it
[5:04] wasn't unusual for us to pray for our
[5:06] kids and see God touched them we've done
[5:08] that many times and see God touch our
[5:10] kids that's not what the testimony is
[5:11] about this testimony is about the
[5:14] boldness associated with that brother
[5:16] Dale has been talking about a nod from
[5:18] God the boldness that the Apostles had
[5:20] in the book of Acts when they were just
[5:22] charged into room take charge brought my
[5:24] brother branham says take every spirit
[5:26] under my control there was no fear there
[5:28] was no worry there was no concern God
[5:31] was in control working in them and they
[5:33] had people have taken notice that they
[5:34] had been with Jesus because they were
[5:36] doing the same things he did and I
[5:38] believe it's time for that to be
[5:39] restored I'm not saying this is that but
[5:42] if it's not that I believe it's coming
[5:44] and I have a reasonable expectation I'll
[5:48] tell you why I'm expecting it in a
[5:49] moment if I don't forget but anyway we
[5:53] went over there and prayed and there
[5:54] were many thoughts going through my mind
[5:56] at that moment and there was a presence
[5:58] of fear no doubt there was a concern
[6:00] there was a I guess the temptation the
[6:02] fear because my baby is not breathing
[6:04] and but nonetheless I shunt that and
[6:08] there was no fear and I just knew simply
[6:11] that God's in control one of the things
[6:14] about the trials we faced we faced a
[6:16] bear of false doctrine early on in our
[6:18] marriage we faced a line of fear with
[6:21] either dying and we faced this Goliath
[6:23] of that tree in our yard lying in a bear
[6:26] and Goliath sounds familiar all these
[6:29] trials have caused us to realize one
[6:30] thing that God is with us and you can
[6:32] think about the trials in your life and
[6:34] recognize God is with you there's one
[6:35] thing you can do too is
[6:37] meditation when these are little things
[6:39] happen there's totally out of the blue a
[6:41] seizure that comes out of nowhere after
[6:43] two and a half years of no seizures and
[6:44] no fever associated with it and then not
[6:47] breathing think it not strange
[6:48] concerning the fiery trials that shall
[6:50] come upon you because you possess the
[6:52] revelation in Jesus Christ
[6:53] all of Hell is against that and will
[6:56] defy that but it can't it can't stand
[6:58] against it so that's what's happening
[7:01] and if you think when these all little
[7:03] things come along just meditate after
[7:04] the fact and think well now I see God's
[7:07] hand here and I see God's hand there and
[7:10] you begin to realize that God was all in
[7:12] that trial when you felt forsaken he was
[7:15] there but anyway we went and laid hands
[7:17] on her and prayed and the predominant
[7:18] thought in my mind all the fear and the
[7:20] confusion and the kids just screaming I
[7:23] said girls just get upstairs they
[7:24] wouldn't stop screaming they were scared
[7:25] to death
[7:27] all that bombarding me but the the
[7:30] prevailing thought in my mind was I've
[7:32] immersed myself in the Word of God for
[7:34] years I should be able to see God cast
[7:37] this demon out of this child I've been
[7:39] on a journey I've come from somewhere
[7:41] not what I want to be not what ought to
[7:42] be but not what it used to be what it
[7:43] used to be was very afraid and I've been
[7:46] running with my girls in fear hide my
[7:49] eyes saying Lord I can't watch masters
[7:50] save us we perish
[7:52] you know like in mark 438 but when Jesus
[7:55] came on the scene in mark 438 when he
[7:58] woke from that in the storm you know the
[8:00] disciples woke him up and said we're
[8:02] perished and we're dying they had seen
[8:04] storms before we had seen this storm
[8:06] before but it was just a little bit
[8:08] different and that was what struck
[8:10] caused that fear to be there to be
[8:12] present there and and she just awoke and
[8:15] calmly rebuked I believe he calmly
[8:17] rebuked you know the winds and the waves
[8:19] and then the disciples for their
[8:21] unbelief Jesus did that on this occasion
[8:25] but through me and Gaby and I believe
[8:27] he's supposed to be here in a mini
[8:28] member body but here's the one thing I
[8:30] want to get to the number one emphasis
[8:31] on a place I know a lot of people this
[8:34] is such a paradox to me
[8:35] a lot of people placed a lot of emphasis
[8:37] on this and their brother Donny Reagan
[8:38] and all these other big name preachers
[8:40] nothing against that but make sure you
[8:43] don't overlook the fivefold ministry
[8:44] that we have here because that's where
[8:47] me and Gaby put our emphasis she stays
[8:48] up till past midnight listening to the
[8:50] five ministers and those brother Forney
[8:52] those that come through here because we
[8:54] count that our responsibility and that
[8:56] the ones that God has sent to us that's
[8:58] the minister ordained to see us through
[8:59] I believe because I'm not at Happy
[9:01] Valley okay nothing whatsoever against
[9:04] listen brother Donnie or anybody but you
[9:06] make sure you're getting what's being
[9:07] preached here because you'll overlook
[9:09] Christ in simplicity because he hides
[9:11] and reveals in simplicity just like they
[9:14] missed him two thousand years ago people
[9:15] that should have seen who he was missed
[9:16] him and we're missing him because he's
[9:19] here in this fivefold ministry you say
[9:20] oh it's just brother Wade he's kind of
[9:22] silly got a silly nature about him but
[9:24] God is using him same thing brother Dale
[9:26] brother Lewis brother Aaron and brother
[9:28] Bob and and that's that's what we feed
[9:31] upon and gabi not and we're seeing
[9:33] manifestation we're seeing signs and and
[9:35] it's not just signs and wonders I mean
[9:37] people even false Christ's will arise
[9:39] and have signs and wonders it's the
[9:41] power I'm talking about the boldness and
[9:43] not being afraid and no one who you have
[9:45] believed there's many other things I
[9:48] could say but I'll stop right there but
[9:49] God bless y'all I think we all have a
[9:59] testimony amen
[10:01] if you're in the word and it's revealed
[10:05] to you you know he's your healer amen
[10:07] and all the other manifestations he
[10:09] comes me for that reason I know that my
[10:11] god is real let's sing it this evening

[25:50] through 5 and in every 2nd Timothy 3 and
[25:56] I axed to and I'm gonna start at verse 1
[26:02] it says when when the day of Pentecost
[26:07] was fully come they were all with one
[26:11] Accord in one place
[26:13] didn't you have two churches holu didn't
[26:17] help that you know there was in one
[26:18] place Holly and suddenly there came a
[26:22] sound from heaven from heaven as a
[26:25] rushing mighty wind and and it filled
[26:27] all the house where they were sitting
[26:30] and there appeared unto them cloven

[29:04] the reading of his word of God this
[29:06] evening and I took from you notice I
[29:09] started from the book of Acts because I
[29:11] want to deal with that for a moment
[29:13] because I believe that people's are
[29:15] getting to a church by how many Oh
[29:18] to the book of Acts so when the table
[29:22] title this evening stop before you cross
[29:27] over into the realm of the book of Acts
[29:30] that's my title stop before you cross
[29:33] over into the realm of the book of Acts
[29:35] now what you don't notice here I begin
[29:37] to look at them playing on the book of
[29:39] Acts in a way
[29:40] why don't we why have this message come
[29:43] to restore how do we know the way I
[29:45] looked at the message itself there is no
[29:48] way for you to look at the message and
[29:50] not see God manifested in the book of
[29:53] Acts oh you said brother Joel you say
[29:55] uh-uh
[29:56] but we got something at that nada we got
[29:59] something that double go back say God
[30:01] yeah we got Edward the book of Acts have
[30:03] what we got here's the baptism that
[30:05] already go he said the message wouldn't
[30:07] work not the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost
[30:09] hallway will be the same
[30:10] how did I begin to realize this but stop
[30:13] be uh stop before you're going to the
[30:15] rim of the book that and I begin to
[30:17] study what what called people not to go
[30:20] all the way and get the Holy Ghost what
[30:23] color if you notice in the in the book
[30:25] of Genesis her when he came into contact
[30:28] with the devil honey what did he preach
[30:31] a he seduced her to take knowledge over
[30:35] the word this is the edge of knowledge
[30:38] Holly this is a Jew ever learning but
[30:40] never able to come to the knowledge of
[30:42] the truth
[30:42] hallo everybody know there everybody
[30:44] wanted no quote everybody can quote
[30:46] dementia everybody can talk about the
[30:48] man like the message is not a quote that
[30:51] message is a person it's a book of
[30:54] action manifestation hello begin to live
[30:57] here I'm beginning to think about those
[30:58] things right so I began to realize so
[31:00] evil he came to even he began to topi he
[31:03] seduced in heat
[31:05] Holly went with painted way he took Iman
[31:08] and he got he takes out knowledge all
[31:11] the faith oh she had to do a big guy oh
[31:15] she had to do is accept the word out of
[31:17] accept word how do you in eternal life
[31:19] they were just kept dwelling
[31:20] nobody wouldn't been that song when they
[31:22] never been say won't he be a time how do
[31:25] you because they wouldn't never got old
[31:26] they wouldn't
[31:28] had a peg in their body that song when
[31:30] they never been mentioned but because
[31:32] they took knowledge over the word that
[31:34] was others in this area so now you begin
[31:38] to look at your brother Jule
[31:39] so whatever what we're trying to get
[31:41] back to hello there now we find I heard
[31:44] somewhere we find her is such an age of
[31:47] knowledge help knowledge help took the
[31:50] place or the baptism the Holy Ghost how
[31:53] do we go Satan is able to make you think
[31:56] the more you learn the more you got
[31:59] Holly buddy if you don't get born again

[32:29] want God how do them manifest himself
[32:32] how do not just above me not just beside
[32:34] me but in me and is it so I'm beginning
[32:39] to look at them things right so we begin
[32:41] to realize so we took it we are taking
[32:43] knowledge in everywhere so we got to
[32:45] realize your table one faith how many
[32:50] times you preach I don't care what title
[32:52] you put on this message it ain't but one
[32:53] faith either one Peru John 739 returned
[32:57] enable one safe you can put any tighter
[33:00] you won't you own this message what were
[33:02] you borrowed it down it's one thing and
[33:04] one Lord it one baptism with you all
[33:08] just in you all how did to the end of
[33:10] the world how do you cannot change that
[33:12] one thing so that we begin to realize it
[33:15] you said what brother Joe so we got a
[33:17] different message in India there yeah we
[33:19] got yeah what God come to do he come to
[33:22] shores
[33:22] what we come from with what we a in what
[33:24] we go I'll do that word does nobody come
[33:27] to do the revelation to this message did
[33:29] not come to preach another message it
[33:33] come to me that they
[33:34] we did not understand to open I
[33:37] understand there so we can understand
[33:39] what we a who are we going to do when
[33:42] you get the final revelation you didn't
[33:44] realize I come from God and going back
[33:46] to God hallelujah Edward that when you
[33:49] was in the first place so I began to
[33:50] look at him place right there and the
[33:53] soup rotation the Prophet says so
[33:56] everything always been from the time
[33:58] Adam turn now into the terminal and the
[34:02] Moses time it always did why didn't they
[34:06] cross over into the promised land in the
[34:09] Tavor boy why did they wander in the
[34:11] wilderness people like Balaam begin to
[34:15] teach knowledge stead of faith
[34:19] you got over here why didn't they cross
[34:22] over when Jesus came on the scene why
[34:24] didn't they cross over and receive Jesus
[34:27] the word except you believe over here
[34:29] you're dying you're saying why connect
[34:31] save receive it because of their
[34:33] traditions in the word them guys had
[34:37] some truth
[34:37] they've guys had a lot of truth they can
[34:40] prove that natural genealogy they came
[34:43] from a by him holiday knew what it was
[34:46] hey they say and were with Jesus let her
[34:49] head away we're not in bondage to know
[34:51] me
[34:51] Abraham is our Father do you realize
[34:54] they knew that they was not smoking pot
[34:58] they were not drinking but was they were
[35:00] good really religious people that knew
[35:04] the law to the dot so Regina came on the
[35:09] scene they were full of knowledge but we
[35:13] ain't told my no we told my revelation
[35:14] he didn't come to talk to their now they
[35:16] couldn't reveal who he was so now here
[35:19] they was so they tell each either they
[35:21] do first thing if you were one read it
[35:22] I'm gonna go kind of cookie to say to
[35:25] her
[35:25] Holly ain't neither even just say John
[35:29] 833 all the way down to 43 and it just
[35:33] keep getting more and more but here they
[35:34] were they telling Jesus who they were
[35:36] saying we're not in bondage to no man
[35:38] dare we
[35:40] Abraham see and we can prove it we can
[35:45] prove it we don't study this thing Jesus
[35:47] you don't come trying to kill her who we
[35:49] are we got this thing figured out of
[35:51] prayer but had you met him over here
[35:54] 18 inches all it takes heli so any if
[35:59] you notice here so here they go they
[36:01] telling Jesus these things right here
[36:02] honey then they finally come to the girl
[36:05] who did Jesus say if you wouldn't know
[36:07] Abraham you wouldn't new me believe me
[36:10] go Abraham we're preaching about me have
[36:13] you with a new Abraham a new what he
[36:15] does you would have been looking at the
[36:16] world and you want to see that Joshua
[36:19] type me they never go to Joshua if you
[36:24] notice it when they're getting their
[36:25] books they never coded according Moses
[36:27] they go to neighbor why didn't they
[36:29] quote Joshua they never cross over they
[36:32] never seen what God did on this day the
[36:35] wandering around in the wilderness and
[36:36] only to say I thought had manna in the
[36:38] wilderness and Jesus sitting there one
[36:41] of them did honey
[36:42] I didn't want to understand the world of
[36:45] eat manna I want you to cross over and
[36:47] receive the bat-signal or you go I want
[36:50] you to eat the old corner leg so we
[36:55] begin to look at these things here you
[36:56] know that's what it is today
[36:58] so we begin to realize her so that we
[37:01] begin to think of no things because this
[37:03] revelation did not come that keep us in
[37:06] a neutral position
[37:08] you know just been a good church person
[37:10] how are you just going to turn off I
[37:12] never done nobody wrong I never stole
[37:15] I'd never steal so what I was in the
[37:18] message that don't mean nothing
[37:20] are you in Christ are you read are you
[37:24] in the Christ that doesn't I mean this
[37:29] look here don't you - no sister now I
[37:32] want to this take a thought about we
[37:34] talk about knowledge for a minute now I
[37:37] don't support English you know when say
[37:40] I mean Ignotus areas or brother I'm so
[37:44] I'm so humble I brought me O'Connor
[37:47] burned 20 cups of 20 quarts are all that
[37:51] humility let's do pitted
[37:54] it's not humbled by burning twitting
[37:58] football 20 quads are all to get to
[38:00] church it's done hum about that honey so
[38:03] you know people take humility and try to
[38:05] pay stupidity with humility but we told
[38:08] Matt we're not talking about that we
[38:10] talk about Christ we come at this word
[38:13] limiting you it's time to quit playing
[38:15] with the message people don't talk of
[38:21] this visit we got more more in
[38:23] Revelation in the preacher we got more
[38:24] fights now and we ever had how do you
[38:26] what it is because what did it brother
[38:28] and said why appeal while my somewhat
[38:30] fussing and fighting over a message
[38:31] ain't over the Revelator he say it's the
[38:34] lack of Revelation
[38:36] if you know who you is you got nothing
[38:38] to prove to nobody you don't have to
[38:40] going shout and jump on your hair to
[38:42] prove you got to only go you just keep
[38:44] walking
[38:45] your life at testify you got the Holy
[38:47] Ghost so we were getting to realize okay
[38:54] you know you know like I told mother
[38:56] dancing you know this knowledge it's
[38:59] gonna become so real come people says
[39:02] now have tapped into more knowledge and
[39:04] helped me anything you can know
[39:06] everything now brother Sam can't hear me
[39:09] nothing who told you do you got a divine
[39:18] gift that God called you to preach the
[39:20] gospel even the women can preach now ya
[39:28] know Sammy row right there who told you
[39:31] to reach holy to God give you a divine
[39:34] gift to preach the gospel how do you not
[39:37] you in the role play that way you find
[39:39] so many people falling away cost you out
[39:42] of place when David got out of place he
[39:45] felt this way it is today so you know
[39:49] you said bridge or you know what gifts
[39:51] and callings are predestinated by God
[39:53] how do you need you know I don't
[39:55] understand him do you need a prayer to
[39:57] God open my understanding if he
[40:00] preaching me to divine revelation
[40:02] God crisis start revealing himself not
[40:04] around me but in me so beginning to do
[40:08] looking at the things so I really
[40:11] realized here
[40:12] Satan job is the by pat get you to
[40:16] bypass the book of Acts you know about a
[40:20] pass and away with you traveling the ROI
[40:22] when you they got a roadblock they all
[40:25] we have a bypass what time I got on the
[40:28] bypass route it took me 35 miles out of
[40:31] the way but it was a bad pass
[40:34] I seen places I didn't even thought
[40:36] existed in North Carolina sucker laughs
[40:38] but it was about morale but you know was
[40:41] there and they were saying that was
[40:43] Satan done he took the book of knowledge
[40:45] and challenged the book of Revelation so
[40:49] now you said brother how you get there
[40:51] some people I want you to see her
[40:53] understand the mysteries it's not since
[40:57] you got the Holy Ghost that mean that
[40:59] you have got the ability to gain
[41:01] knowledge and understand let me see what
[41:05] Paul says here let us feel I think I'll
[41:08] just read this one first Corinthians 13
[41:12] verse 1
[41:13] watch out what Paul say Satan is using
[41:16] this technique to actually turn your
[41:21] mind you think I got all this not man I
[41:24] understand the mystery nobody can tell
[41:26] me nothin holiday you hate I'm deeper
[41:30] than the pastor yeah you might be deeper
[41:35] but what direction you go man 1st
[41:41] Corinthians 13 and verse 1 Paul begin to
[41:46] do with this deal with this thought
[41:48] record now I want you to know that on
[41:49] the day of Pentecost they spoke with
[41:52] tongues but they spoke in a language
[41:55] they everybody understood people the old
[41:59] brother
[42:00] but Paul doma and Janice me though I
[42:03] speak with tongues man
[42:06] godspeed would turn a man in angel and
[42:09] have not charity I become as a sounding
[42:12] brass and a tweet lism that was a sound
[42:16] that come from heaven like a Russian
[42:18] buddy weird but it had a voice behind it
[42:20] it had a message behind it that sound
[42:24] was just not a bunch of ride away don't
[42:25] know if I'll ever trumpet give an
[42:28] uncertain sound how can you prepare for
[42:30] battle
[42:30] it had a message with it and then he
[42:34] says and then he goes oh dear ball begin
[42:36] the speaker and even though I have the
[42:38] gift of prophecy and understand what we
[42:43] need to stop on it we're right there
[42:45] that what bit the people didn't trouble
[42:47] we got so much mysteries now we don't
[42:49] need God to tell us nothing Eve got so
[42:52] Revelator she didn't need God to tell
[42:54] her what address she didn't need God to
[42:56] tell her what to do hey all she could
[42:58] say God he said you could be as God you
[43:01] don't need God to tell you you got your
[43:03] own independent man you got what here
[43:05] you are just like God II he misses write
[43:10] her it's not be mistress
[43:13] do not become flesh you got a problem if
[43:17] the mistress is in your mind ain't not
[43:19] in your heart
[43:20] you got a problem honey one catalyst
[43:22] how'd it go remember her knowledge
[43:25] puffeth up but revelation humbles so
[43:29] understanding missing will you
[43:30] understand something you feel like man I
[43:32] mean you know where we go to churches
[43:34] today I preaches invasion I've been
[43:36] everywhere and I'm not sure about I do
[43:38] not go to try to out preacher me because
[43:42] I feel like everybody on Gill I can't be
[43:45] brother saying me him free to get into
[43:47] mayhem free to get in Jamaica there that
[43:49] we had some good means he he did to
[43:51] teach it and then I just come back and
[43:53] put the fire behind it I felt myself I
[43:55] say here to teach it now he put the I
[43:57] prefer a full of gasoline only me was a
[43:59] match
[44:01] so that we don't know we did we had a
[44:03] good daddy we Brazil holy so that no one
[44:06] is other hit one man ministry is the
[44:08] winner bill over each other not put each
[44:11] other down but see the day wider mystery
[44:14] become such a battle why he comes think
[44:19] about it
[44:19] I judge came fellowship with destroy or
[44:21] we don't sell my family they see it
[44:24] a little different for me where did they
[44:25] see a little bit let me ask you one
[44:27] question had you prayed how do you God
[44:31] whatever this is
[44:32] maybe maybe because anything to make us
[44:35] feel a little different it ain't God
[44:37] that's moving highly the word and
[44:39] nowhere did say then when we come
[44:40] together in other word to the preaching
[44:42] of the word how do we come together one
[44:44] day you look at it normally you said the
[44:47] same thing you're just using a different
[44:48] phrase and you know you know we need to
[44:51] talk about the Neuberger years ago how
[44:53] you say - so you scared somebody to do
[44:56] but when you got to really talking to
[44:58] the people long time they saying the
[45:00] same thing but they needs got a
[45:01] terminology they're using but I'm going
[45:05] to look at it we don't want to get in
[45:06] that right here because I realize if you
[45:08] get the right nature you only right he's
[45:13] understanding old mystery and Oh what
[45:18] how can you have all this and not have
[45:21] the Holy Ghost you've got all the
[45:23] knowledge you got all the mysteries and
[45:25] everything is going in your favor
[45:27] and oh hell oh I got knowledge
[45:33] I got mystery I got faith and all these
[45:36] dangers without the Holy Ghost in you
[45:39] and satanic it's satanic
[45:42] honey SoDo I could know face so that I
[45:45] could remove mountains and have not I am
[45:50] not dead and then a word did he hug her
[45:53] and when you say brother I go fight I
[45:56] give everything I got to the poor I
[45:58] gotta miss you
[45:59] he it's alright to do all of it but make
[46:01] sure it done by the popular Holy Ghost
[46:06] Paul say though I bestow all my goods to
[46:09] feed the poor and and though I give my
[46:15] body to be burned but that's the
[46:19] sacrifice oh that is a real sacrifice oh
[46:23] I'm gonna give my body to be burned but
[46:25] you better make sure you got the whole
[46:26] ego when you do it cuz you don't you
[46:29] just committed suicide in a wish be
[46:32] burned and have not charity it profiteth
[46:36] did he go to anyhow to charity loads
[46:38] over in New York aldetha so we begin to
[46:40] look at this is what Satan is using now
[46:44] keep the people out of the book of Acts
[46:47] this is what he used he used and he
[46:50] using knowledge to get the people people
[46:52] to bypass the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[46:55] and that's what the problem being in
[46:57] especially he using it now what you
[46:59] realized her this message if it ever
[47:03] puffs up another but you're gonna run
[47:07] another book of Acts behind it that word
[47:09] and come on day use a Queen of Sheba
[47:12] he's a Christ in heaven Christ in every
[47:14] church will write a book of Acts behind
[47:16] it that's exactly right because the
[47:19] first one wrote a book of Acts behind it
[47:22] so dirt dirt there you are so he began
[47:26] to brainy st. they were right away why
[47:28] he kept going back to the book of Acts
[47:31] let me read of in the church a book this
[47:34] is I brought a tell he brought down a

[1:00:58] revealed his it revealed his word
[1:01:01] attempted disgusted of God peoples and
[1:01:06] discredit of God word right down to the
[1:01:10] entire with what knowledge everywhere
[1:01:14] not in the Pentecostal message today

[1:01:38] skiing on the bridge god Zoe and there
[1:01:42] was anything in the world right down to
[1:01:45] the end he - he cast into the lake of
[1:01:47] fire he fight that he cannot stand it he
[1:01:52] know give the people get their true
[1:01:57] revelation of the true church it'll be
[1:02:01] the same book of Acts in a rape of the
[1:02:03] same power in a brave will to say only
[1:02:05] those in a cast out del ni geodesy and
[1:02:09] Italy all right
[1:02:14] amen
[1:02:15] president this one right here that's
[1:02:17] what his little brother keep running
[1:02:18] like that believe it was he said the
[1:02:22] true revelation a true church and what
[1:02:25] shield and what she stand for that she
[1:02:28] can't do the greater work she can do the
[1:02:32] greater word holy is more than that
[1:02:34] therefore how do you have to deal with
[1:02:36] one but now you gotta deal with
[1:02:37] thousands of how over the world she
[1:02:40] could do the greater words he says she
[1:02:47] will be it's the word I want to use an
[1:02:51] invincible army and visibly
[1:02:54] uncomfortable saying can't cover you you

[1:03:00] the true revelation that Christ is in
[1:03:03] you to over Lori you are more than a
[1:03:05] conqueror say they cannot conquer you
[1:03:07] you might get in a violent but you'll
[1:03:09] pick yourself back up that the power God
[1:03:12] put in the church thank God I didn't
[1:03:17] know how this is gonna come out but God
[1:03:18] it seemed like he wanna preach this baby
[1:03:20] come on nurse been to a ball day but now
[1:03:25] what the problem is
[1:03:28] just don't get relaxed just because you
[1:03:33] come to the message or you feel a call
[1:03:36] to come because if you do that need you
[1:03:38] don't find that Judas was the same way
[1:03:41] Judas didn't only come to the message
[1:03:44] 272 of the church but Judas shared the
[1:03:47] knowledge of the mystery he walked with
[1:03:50] the words behind skin he cast out Devils
[1:03:54] in Jesus name but he was born of the
[1:03:58] Spirit because he did not go all the way
[1:04:01] to Pentecost saving technology and stop
[1:04:07] Judas before he got the Pentecost right
[1:04:09] knowledge of reasoning trying to force
[1:04:13] Jesus to do something I said Jesus out
[1:04:17] here raised up his short power Jesus
[1:04:19] didn't come to fight him he didn't come
[1:04:21] to build on me he come to give his life
[1:04:24] that's right brother come
[1:04:25] give his life so they give me a few more
[1:04:29] minutes I pressure you nervous so buddy
[1:04:31] why would you to realize her so that's
[1:04:34] why Satan today he's building he's
[1:04:36] building programs even the message got
[1:04:39] programs I preached that be heroes to go
[1:04:42] in a church and I preached angle come to
[1:04:47] me but a a preaching they come hand me a
[1:04:49] program wait that's the last that you
[1:04:53] hand me cuz I don't even know how to act

[1:06:51] more supernatural than what brother
[1:06:53] Brendan was doing and I'm thinking
[1:06:55] wouldn't that trouble your mind to I
[1:06:56] said then how you would you know brother
[1:06:59] Brendan was different from the rest him
[1:07:00] he said the truth of the matter was he
[1:07:03] said it was not the miracles that
[1:07:04] vindicated brother Brian he said it was
[1:07:07] the discernment Halu he said when it
[1:07:10] come down to the discernment could not
[1:07:12] at all guys hit the whole time they were
[1:07:14] here to miss one her and he's about that

[1:07:20] condition is not up gonna do that thank
[1:07:24] God he done worse
[1:07:27] praise God I don't know me but I don't
[1:07:30] let you know this God is you know he

[1:07:35] but I do he said a used to prayer and he
[1:07:38] would come to me he said he will fast a
[1:07:39] whole week that you preaches prayer in

[1:07:50] he said brother fast are we I prayed I
[1:07:53] would God give me a dynamic message to

[1:07:58] message and I get to the church I'm
[1:08:00] gonna beat her and the pastor say I'm
[1:08:01] gonna pick him out a lead shipper the
[1:08:03] whole ego he always picked the war they
[1:08:06] had the prestige he already picked the
[1:08:11] one that can bring in the money he never

[1:09:11] here that the probably got here things
[1:09:13] he said and then he goes back here and
[1:09:15] he reads I'm gonna just read a quota to
[1:09:17] so we could kind of see why I say what
[1:09:18] I'm saying he said looking at the unseen
[1:09:20] he said Jesus said I am the vine ye are
[1:09:23] the branch he said in divine birth the
[1:09:28] fruit of the first branch and the first
[1:09:31] branch was Pentecost same but see if you
[1:09:37] don't go back to pinnacle you gotta
[1:09:39] change the life that's in the back you
[1:09:41] don't see if you don't go back and do
[1:09:43] the same you say Brent you I'm not
[1:09:44] trying to put you in the minute now if
[1:09:47] we got to hell what Paul preach brother
[1:09:49] Bradley could not leave Paul teaches if
[1:09:52] he would he had to add to the scripture
[1:09:55] Paul did not Paul went to a for his God
[1:09:59] would care he's a prayer that God will
[1:10:02] open to me adore utterance that I may
[1:10:04] understand God said no it's not for you
[1:10:07] to do I guess somebody is confused but
[1:10:12] Paul wanted to go for this he went
[1:10:15] further so what did he do he did not
[1:10:17] show he laid a foundation it was a
[1:10:20] foundation I have written a book God
[1:10:23] will open the door then the father who
[1:10:25] step right here that be the one to open
[1:10:27] this door
[1:10:28] it was Christ and open the door
[1:10:30] revelation did was it was Christ come
[1:10:33] down he put his head feet on the land it
[1:10:36] won't be known to see and it's whoa only
[1:10:40] God could have done it but then you say
[1:10:43] would it was Christ coming down but how
[1:10:45] do you need reveal himself only one way
[1:10:47] you can reveal himself
[1:10:48] Luana three and seven baby don't do you
[1:10:52] man went through the whole Bible way and
[1:10:54] what Jesus could come on over to John
[1:10:55] was on earth hello he had to be in all
[1:10:57] with the scripture how did John had to
[1:10:59] be boys six month before g-good car
[1:11:02] would never come it wouldn't it never be
[1:11:04] no Savior because the world all wake up
[1:11:07] to the prophets he says he said with
[1:11:12] Pentecost and the blessings is recorded
[1:11:16] in and the blessings is recorded in the
[1:11:19] book of Acts
[1:11:20] and if that first bridge was pinnacles
[1:11:24] the branch will have to be pinnacle and
[1:11:28] it have to burn the same type of a
[1:11:33] church and behavioral and the first
[1:11:36] bridge breath it's the same Holy Ghost
[1:11:39] but I'm not trying to come and change us
[1:11:42] back to something that the probably
[1:11:44] didn't preach how do you probably preach
[1:11:45] the message he preached as far as God
[1:11:49] would permit him to go and he did it in
[1:11:52] a revelation because he said this is it
[1:11:54] for me he said this is ever me I will
[1:11:57] admit this revelation right here I'd
[1:11:59] encourage you for that I could go it's
[1:12:01] up to him to take you on over here
[1:12:03] I'm a deep tree come to low degree and
[1:12:06] he must agree he the one gonna become
[1:12:09] popular you notice in the book of Acts
[1:12:14] when they got in the book of Acts was
[1:12:17] John decrease he never was talked about
[1:12:19] much in the book of Acts they went back
[1:12:22] to Moses in every walk because their God
[1:12:24] were talking about Jesus do that what he
[1:12:25] was coming to do but he never really
[1:12:27] mentioned him much in the book of that
[1:12:28] but because Jeremy's read agree
[1:12:30] Christ was increasing how he became your
[1:12:33] automa
[1:12:34] nobody around don't preach that name of
[1:12:36] Jesus and it won't that name preach
[1:12:40] everything they called the devil the
[1:12:42] problem when that name taken was flesh
[1:12:45] there's a problem with the devil how do
[1:12:47] when you begin to speak that name by the
[1:12:48] revelation that devil got probably dead
[1:12:51] name hallelujah
[1:12:54] let me just say this and get rid of
[1:12:57] pursuit right here everyman God born
[1:13:01] again and his sins and his sinful nature
[1:13:05] was killed in him that that is that is
[1:13:09] in the message it was not so from the
[1:13:11] beginning and this sinful nature was
[1:13:13] killed in him
[1:13:14] and a new man being born in him which is
[1:13:18] Christ which is Christ Jesus he said the
[1:13:25] Son of God then you didn't use surrender
[1:13:29] yourself completely to Christ and Christ
[1:13:31] come in and write a book of Acts God
[1:13:37] what is the book it's no more than to
[1:13:40] act up the Holy Ghost into people I
[1:13:42] leave any and through through you and
[1:13:45] through you how I know that it's the
[1:13:48] true oh my friend how I know it's the
[1:13:51] truth
[1:13:52] musicians come the book of Acts the book
[1:13:56] of the Holy Spirit hello people we meet
[1:13:59] what's wrong today too much theology
[1:14:02] don't been producing the message that
[1:14:04] people can't reach out with faith and
[1:14:06] accept God for nothing no more because
[1:14:09] everybody got to have a solution some
[1:14:14] some reason for it to happen if I can
[1:14:18] figure it out
[1:14:19] I could believe it well as lot of things
[1:14:23] you ain't figured out yet like the
[1:14:25] proper God say I can't figure out how
[1:14:28] can a cow eat green grass your white
[1:14:33] milk and turn yellow but if I can't
[1:14:35] figure that out they don't matter
[1:14:37] I came flicker out when they typically
[1:14:41] don't prove that a bum became fly but we
[1:14:44] only got one problem with the bumblebee
[1:14:45] flying he just don't know what he don't
[1:14:49] know he can fly and said he don't know
[1:14:51] he gave like Holly that was wrong we
[1:14:53] know too much how did why not believe
[1:14:56] God all things are possible to them that
[1:15:00] believe not nothing nothing that we
[1:15:02] video I just accept God it his word he
[1:15:08] said brother Jul God has not come to
[1:15:11] rehab people's this message is not a
[1:15:15] rehab where life will always be that way
[1:15:19] my grandmother had this disease and and
[1:15:22] I'm going to have the same problem you
