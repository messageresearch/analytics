[11:39] Romans 7 now remember the men are
[11:42] supposed to meet after the service this
[11:45] afternoon to talk about the um Father's
[11:48] Day time next weekend and also just make
[11:51] sure you you know you understand what
[11:52] you got to bring if you don't get to
[11:54] come or be there to understand just make
[11:57] sure you bring enough you know fix it to
[11:59] where you can take care of it we
[12:00] generally try to take care of of the
[12:03] food and the stuff like that you know
[12:05] but you have to bring your drinks and
[12:07] your clothes and your sleeping bags and
[12:09] things and it may be a little cool so if
[12:11] I you I'd put a little extra in to do CU
[12:14] been getting an extremely large amount
[12:16] of rain so it may be a different thing
[12:19] if you can't do that come up and be with
[12:20] us and sit around the campfire and eat
[12:22] some catfish and I mean some trout and
[12:26] just have a good time you can bring your
[12:27] catfish we'll cook it too
[12:30] but we'll have a good time doing it and
[12:33] all fellowshipping together I think
[12:35] that's about all the announcements that
[12:38] is to be made so just remember these
[12:41] things Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[12:43] for this day in your grace and your
[12:45] kindness unto us and thank you for you
[12:48] Lord because without you where would we
[12:51] be Lord our whole dependance is upon one
[12:54] thing that you are God and you change
[12:57] not that you're Lord revealing yourself
[13:00] unto us by way of the opening of the
[13:03] word it may sound like to a lot of
[13:06] people that this is just old stories but
[13:09] remember In Those Old stories there is
[13:11] redemption we love you and we thank you
[13:13] Father and we pray that you would just
[13:15] bless each one remember the ones that
[13:18] are here remember the sick ones and just
[13:20] have your way with each and every one of
[13:21] us we love you and we thank you we
[13:24] commit it all to you now in Jesus name
[13:27] amen Romans
[13:31] 7 know you not brethren for I speak to
[13:34] them that know the law how that the law
[13:37] hath dominion over man as long as he
[13:39] liveth now remember now he's going to
[13:41] illustrate it he's using an illustration
[13:45] to explain what he's talking about for
[13:47] the woman which hath an husb husband is
[13:49] bound by the law to her husband as long
[13:51] as he liveth but if the husband be dead
[13:54] she is loose from the law of her husband
[13:56] so then if while her husband liveth she
[13:58] be married married to another man she
[14:00] shall be called an adulteress but if her
[14:02] husband be dead she is free from that
[14:05] law so that she is no adulteress though
[14:07] she be married to another man wherefore
[14:10] my brethren when ye also are become dead
[14:13] to the my brethren ye also are become
[14:16] dead to the law how by the body of
[14:19] Christ that we should be married to
[14:21] another even to him that who is raised
[14:23] from the dead that we should bring forth
[14:25] fruit unto God for when we were in the
[14:28] flesh
[14:29] the Motions of sin which were by the law
[14:32] did work in our members to bring forth
[14:34] fruit unto death see the law couldn't
[14:37] deliver
[14:38] nobody I don't know why everybody wants
[14:41] rules and regulations and something to
[14:43] do when the law could never deliver it's
[14:47] a policeman to put you in
[14:50] jail it's not a
[14:53] deliverer but now we are delivered from
[14:56] the law that being dead wherein we were
[14:58] h H that we should serve in the newness
[15:00] of spirit and not in the oldness of the
[15:03] letter you may be seated the Lord add
[15:05] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[15:08] now to try to get on with it we
[15:11] won't back up we'll try to press on with
[15:15] the thought we were bringing this
[15:17] morning to get a point to us to where we
[15:20] can understand now what I'm saying to
[15:24] you and I tell you where that you can
[15:28] study it that way
[15:30] the same quotes that we going to be
[15:32] using this
[15:35] afternoon all right are you
[15:40] listening everybody ain't
[15:43] listening all
[15:45] right the same quotes that we
[15:48] use this afternoon about the New
[15:52] Birth will be
[15:54] used on the marriage and divorce
[15:57] situation
[16:00] and then it will be used
[16:02] onto law and
[16:04] Grace all right we're not having to go
[16:08] to another book I'm not asking you to
[16:09] read 49 different books I'm asking you
[16:11] to read the invisible Union
[16:14] amen but then just read it with an
[16:17] understanding that you
[16:20] know you're listening to what the
[16:22] prophet is saying and then we don't have
[16:25] to worry about it we can and go through
[16:27] the message from there now all right we
[16:29] talking about this morning
[16:31] that we must be separated by spiritual
[16:36] death which means a death to
[16:39] ourselves all right we must die to
[16:42] ourselves as I said this morning don't
[16:44] worry too much about it we're born Dead
[16:48] all
[16:48] right it it shouldn't be a hard thing to
[16:52] die when you realize you're
[16:55] dead that's you maybe a funny way of
[16:58] saying it but
[16:59] it shouldn't be we should
[17:02] realize
[17:05] realization that you and
[17:09] I the best could be is not capable of
[17:14] going before a living God that's right
[17:18] no matter how holy we think we
[17:22] are I tried to explain even people
[17:25] worshiping a totem pole why would
[17:27] somebody Worship in a totem Pole now you
[17:31] know why would they bring some form of
[17:36] offering right right right I mean people
[17:39] who worship totem po bring an offering
[17:42] it may be their own children they offer
[17:44] to to you know whatever or some form why
[17:48] did Cain
[17:50] offer an
[17:53] offering he wanted able to offer an
[17:57] offering
[18:00] see why would we even consider
[18:03] it that we need to offer an
[18:06] offering that point itself shows that
[18:08] we're
[18:10] dead that we're lost right that we're
[18:13] not worthy or why would you come
[18:16] bringing something uh Brother Anderson
[18:18] and them uh they still holding some of
[18:21] their tradition if they come to your
[18:22] house they'll bring you a
[18:25] pineapple well that's just a tradition
[18:29] that's hold over from their customs and
[18:31] ways you know to bring you something why
[18:34] do we have a housewarming for people you
[18:37] know you want to give them something all
[18:41] right see because that's that's all tied
[18:44] together in the worship part of
[18:47] it so then we realize that we're
[18:52] lost and we need a savior
[18:55] am all right and doing that then
[18:59] we must
[19:01] realize that there's something wrong as
[19:04] I was trying to express this morning why
[19:07] is it that everybody that says they
[19:09] believe is not born
[19:14] again don't you ever think like that of
[19:18] why why is it
[19:22] right when you've been through life
[19:24] yourself and seen it or maybe
[19:26] experienced a lot of of going to the
[19:28] altar crying and praying and and fasting
[19:31] and doing all kind of things and come
[19:33] out of it kind of feeling pretty
[19:36] good but then less than a week later
[19:38] you're down at the mouth again you know
[19:41] as we got the old
[19:42] saying you know you're down you're
[19:45] you're you're feel like there's
[19:47] something
[19:50] wrong do we get saved and
[19:56] lost well see then that we should
[19:58] realize that there's something wrong
[20:00] when the prophet would say you accepting
[20:04] Jesus Christ as your savior is wonderful
[20:06] you got to do that but he said has he
[20:09] accepted you that's right that's right
[20:13] see if he don't accept
[20:16] us right we don't get saved right well
[20:20] now why does not he accept
[20:23] us you know what I'm
[20:27] saying why is is it that not every
[20:29] person gets up yes I believe Jesus to be
[20:31] the
[20:33] Christ why is every person not
[20:40] saved it must be something wrong with
[20:42] our approach right amen right
[20:47] something's wrong with those inner
[20:49] beinging parts of us that I tried to
[20:50] bring out the other night about the soul
[20:53] of the individual that even though we're
[20:55] lost we still have a longing for God
[20:58] amen a desire that's right well why
[21:02] doesn't God just run right to our
[21:04] desires and save
[21:07] us it's because we have been
[21:10] blinded to the
[21:13] ways of coming to
[21:16] God now listen by the people that were
[21:20] supposed to known the way to come to God
[21:24] right right now doesn't that exactly fit
[21:28] back there where Jesus was at
[21:30] right when the people that should have
[21:33] known who he was was the people that
[21:35] turned around and killed him that's
[21:36] right
[21:39] amen and they'd have to admit we know
[21:41] you're a teacher come from God and we
[21:43] know yes that God's got to be with you
[21:46] cuz look what you can do that's right
[21:49] but they still wouldn't have it that's
[21:53] right you see church we can Glory all we
[21:56] want to in believing the message and
[21:59] signs and wonders and and everything and
[22:02] still be totally
[22:06] lost you know that's that's on my mind
[22:08] I'm sorry because that's just part of me
[22:11] is to be I I want you to have an
[22:14] experience with God I want you to have
[22:17] something that'll hold on to you not
[22:18] that you hold on to it I ain't never
[22:22] held on to my religion right cuz I
[22:25] always figured I didn't have any right
[22:28] right
[22:30] right it's whether or not he holds on to
[22:35] me all we see in doing that then we must
[22:38] die to ourselves our thinking our ways
[22:41] our actions that's right and become born
[22:44] again right and that old
[22:48] nature that we read this
[22:50] morning that old adamic nature that we
[22:53] had that was born
[22:56] with was our first husband that's right
[23:01] amen
[23:02] right yeah but I've never been married
[23:05] I'm tell you people don't like that
[23:09] see but you see you and I were married
[23:13] to the devil right amen that's right he
[23:17] was our husband that's right
[23:20] right because we're born in his domain
[23:25] right being born in his domain put us in
[23:28] a position to
[23:30] where that he was closer to akin to us
[23:32] than God
[23:34] right yeah but we don't like that you
[23:36] can say well well that's all right I
[23:38] agree with it but then I can see that
[23:40] old SED up part goes back under see you
[23:43] know you don't like that statements like
[23:45] that why
[23:48] not when are we going to just be honest
[23:51] with ourselves and admit where we're at
[23:53] where God can do something for us amen
[23:56] as I saying this morning why was it with
[23:59] John orever who it was he couldn't get
[24:01] the Holy Ghost some of those people
[24:02] couldn't which were born again
[24:03] Christians praying for the people in the
[24:05] book of Acts couldn't get the Holy Ghost
[24:06] come on
[24:08] them they sent for these other brothers
[24:10] they come down simply said a few words
[24:11] laid their hand on the Holy Ghost fell
[24:13] right what was the
[24:17] problem somebody's approach wasn't
[24:21] correct
[24:23] well see then you come up and somebody
[24:26] like me that's dry hide and cut and
[24:28] everything
[24:30] else but you think I'm against emotions
[24:33] and feelings and all it's
[24:36] wonderful but that's the after effect
[24:39] right that's after the baby is born it
[24:44] cries
[24:45] right see we put it ahead we swap it
[24:49] over but what we need see is
[24:52] salvation and to do that then we re
[24:55] really need to realize what did take
[24:57] place
[25:03] see we could spend weeks and months
[25:05] preaching on justification
[25:07] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[25:09] Ghost to see what
[25:11] happens but when are we going to start
[25:13] believing what happen that's it
[25:18] amen and realizing what God has
[25:25] done is was ending up this morning
[25:27] talking about then
[25:31] see God
[25:34] himself had to come
[25:37] down and die that you and
[25:40] I could have
[25:45] salvation this is not to come down and
[25:47] pass out books and you know went on off
[25:50] the Earth and things he had to die
[25:55] right he died for them that was dead
[26:00] cuz we're all dead in sin
[26:03] trespasses
[26:05] right and he had to
[26:08] die and then we lightly think about it
[26:11] and well all we got to do is just
[26:13] believe well the devil's done got ahead
[26:16] of you amen cuz he certainly believed
[26:18] and trembled about it that's right amen
[26:22] that's what I've tried my best to get
[26:23] you to see down through
[26:26] time the ages G by the Bible said God
[26:30] wink to their
[26:31] ignorance right right I said then he
[26:34] commands all men to
[26:38] repent now what does that mean to you
[26:41] that God winked at your ignorance that
[26:43] means we ignorant right and God
[26:45] overlooked it right right is that the
[26:49] best way to say winked that you're
[26:50] ignorant you we were just PL ignorant
[26:53] and he overlooked that all right and
[26:55] saved us anyway amen amen
[26:59] you explain to me how that God can get
[27:00] into the soul of an individual with all
[27:03] the junk that we've
[27:04] got I don't understand that even
[27:08] experience it and everything else but
[27:09] don't understand it how that he can save
[27:12] you and
[27:14] me but it meant he had to
[27:18] die well all he wants us to do is die to
[27:22] ourselves that's right amen accept him
[27:25] as our savior yes right
[27:29] and be born again amen amen that's right
[27:33] that means then our old husband is
[27:37] dead you don't have to worry about that
[27:39] husband no
[27:43] more totally dead gone out of the way
[27:46] annihilated we'll read in a minute where
[27:48] the Prophet said not even one Speck can
[27:50] be
[27:51] left that's why if you read the future
[27:53] home you'll see the most beautiful story
[27:55] of redemption especially about the first
[27:58] 15 18
[28:02] pages and see justification chops off
[28:05] you sin does nothing to your nature
[28:07] that's right sanctification starts to
[28:10] work upon that nature as to bring in the
[28:13] nature of the individual in the line are
[28:16] cleansing us or setting us
[28:18] aside but then you got the Bible says
[28:20] the Holy Ghost and Fire that's right now
[28:24] that's not two works right that's not
[28:26] the Holy Ghost doing one thing the fire
[28:28] doing something else it's the holy ghost
[28:30] coming in to live and his presence burns
[28:35] out all that's left that's right amen
[28:38] you see well if I'm Sanctified what was
[28:40] left the vessel that's right amen that
[28:44] we still lost
[28:47] right just because the devil went out
[28:49] don't make you saved that's right
[28:52] right see then it will come to that
[28:55] basis that
[28:59] that old husband his little telltale
[29:01] signs is still there even though the
[29:04] unclean Spirit has gone
[29:07] out if the unclean Spirit goes out of a
[29:09] man why does it leave him same thing he
[29:11] was when the unclean Spirit came
[29:14] in
[29:16] right what was we when the were when the
[29:18] unclean Spirit come
[29:20] in we was a pure
[29:22] vessel right right because we were a
[29:25] baby right God can't create anything
[29:28] impure so he created US Body Spirit and
[29:31] soul the spirit and soul of that baby
[29:34] come from God the body comes from mama
[29:36] and daddy that's right but it's as
[29:38] perfect as can be I didn't say Eternal I
[29:40] said
[29:41] perfect cuz God can't create something
[29:44] imperfect then we became
[29:49] imperfect right right we became dead cuz
[29:53] even babies until the age of
[29:55] accountability go to heaven right if
[29:58] they die before the age of
[29:59] accountability they go to heaven it goes
[30:01] to prove the devil hadn't taken over
[30:03] that much
[30:05] yet all right see then looking at
[30:09] Salvation we see
[30:11] ourselves and if we can reckon ourselves
[30:21] dead reckon ourselves
[30:24] lost no
[30:26] good and then say Lord come in and save
[30:29] me that's right am and just clean out
[30:32] everything that's
[30:36] left that's why I said it over and over
[30:38] and people don't like it they don't like
[30:39] my ways I'm sorry but I just tell you
[30:41] what happened when I left the Baptist
[30:43] Church I told him at the church we went
[30:45] to I said God got me out of the
[30:47] denomination now I want the denomination
[30:49] out of
[30:52] me what you mean got you left didn't
[30:56] you yep I went out the door looking like
[30:59] this I walked in the other door looking
[31:01] like this I still looked alike and I
[31:04] still acted alike
[31:06] and you
[31:10] know would you
[31:12] see one of these days you'll realize
[31:14] what I'm driving
[31:16] at the new birth finishes when we change
[31:19] the body and walk off this Earth in a
[31:22] Rapture that's the finish of the new
[31:24] birth until that time you know what
[31:26] we're doing we're being being born
[31:30] again so why would we worry about
[31:33] thinking that we could be lost okay
[31:36] that's the devil talking to
[31:38] me see you're sitting there saying I'm
[31:40] the devil talking to you no you didn't
[31:43] notice
[31:45] that who you talking
[31:47] about well he's telling me I'm lost and
[31:50] I know I ain't well you talking about me
[31:52] so go ahead and call me the devil do
[31:54] what you want to but just listen to what
[31:56] I'm saying that's right
[31:59] because your actions and reactions will
[32:01] prove it you get upset for me telling
[32:03] you you're lost if I walk down there to
[32:06] brother dick and I said brother dick I
[32:07] want to tell you up front you're lost as
[32:10] a blind dog in The Meat House thank well
[32:14] he raised his hand and said thank
[32:16] you but what would most of you
[32:21] do I tell you I've been saved I prove
[32:23] that you I've been saved I'm in the
[32:26] message yeah
[32:30] but's see can we take the
[32:32] truth right all right but see dead to
[32:37] ourselves that means that that
[32:39] everything that I
[32:42] was from that Old
[32:45] husband now you see what I'm talking
[32:47] about if you listen You'll see we're
[32:50] talking about the old
[32:52] husband your first husband yes now when
[32:56] we get into invisible and get into the
[32:58] marriage and divorce we're going to talk
[33:00] about having a first
[33:03] husband and then we're going to talk
[33:05] about running around with other
[33:08] husbands right and getting all messed
[33:14] up then when we get to the law and Grace
[33:16] we're going to talk about the old
[33:22] husband see what's going to be hard to
[33:24] realize is is to find out
[33:28] that new
[33:29] birth if you just realize what it is am
[33:32] it makes that Soul so
[33:37] perfect until there's not one mark of
[33:39] sin against
[33:40] it if it is you're not born
[33:44] again
[33:48] right but if we can see that old husband
[33:51] die
[33:53] amen you see what I'm talking about how
[33:55] you going to understand marriage and
[33:57] divorce of a
[34:01] Grace see when you come and brother Dale
[34:04] I've never been married two a three
[34:06] times I got one
[34:09] husband
[34:12] yeah well why so many boyfriends hanging
[34:16] around you know cuz that's why the
[34:19] prophet said
[34:23] it but understand
[34:26] me
[34:30] under that old
[34:32] nature that old
[34:34] husband we're going to read right here
[34:36] and start in on
[34:39] it that put us in this
[34:44] Bible cuz his Bible is a book of records
[34:46] right
[34:48] right Paul don't mind
[34:51] saying I was lost and I was saved right
[34:55] he didn't have no problems about the
[34:57] Bible telling me is lost the word tell
[34:58] him is lost but you know the letter of
[35:01] the word never could tell him he
[35:05] lost you remember the end of the message
[35:07] this morning I said you'd have to
[35:08] realize that God is real
[35:12] is the Holy Ghost is a
[35:14] person it's not a thought or a good idea
[35:17] or a good feeling or he's a
[35:20] person he's the person of the Holy Ghost
[35:23] he's God that's right to come and live
[35:25] in you Paul said the life that I now
[35:27] live In the
[35:28] Flesh I live by
[35:31] what now what was Paul saying the life
[35:34] that I now live in the
[35:37] flesh he didn't claim to be alive in his
[35:42] soul he claimed to be still alive in his
[35:47] flesh right right cuz in his soul Paul
[35:51] wasn't
[35:55] alive amen
[35:58] Paul buried that old
[36:02] man but look at Paul's
[36:07] experience see brother R said God put
[36:09] some people in a place where
[36:12] that that they can tell us these
[36:16] things look at the Apostle
[36:19] Paul the greatest of all the religious
[36:22] side you could think
[36:26] of but yet found out he's lost
[36:36] right see then he realized that there's
[36:38] something
[36:42] wrong so he
[36:46] died he died spiritually to
[36:49] himself and accepted the new
[36:54] birth and to do that
[36:56] meant the only way that could happen was
[36:59] for almighty God to come
[37:04] down no doubt Paul had heard of the and
[37:07] even witnessed the stoning of Steven
[37:09] right right even witnessed him looking
[37:12] up brother around said later then on in
[37:14] life that Paul realized those things and
[37:17] said you know he wasn't even worthy to
[37:19] live he didn't count himself to be he
[37:22] wanted to die for the
[37:26] gospel
[37:28] he had heard about Jesus in his
[37:31] teaching even though he was done p on
[37:34] before he come into existence as we know
[37:36] as writing but you know he probably
[37:38] heard of him I mean how could Jesus been
[37:40] up there with all the Pharisees and the
[37:42] things and all the time that he was for
[37:44] three and A2 years for not basics of
[37:46] people at least around th heard about
[37:49] him but all of that didn't convert
[37:56] him
[37:59] but a personal
[38:01] experience why would brother randam
[38:03] emphasize so much when he would say
[38:07] Paul said once he was struck down that
[38:10] by that blinding blinding
[38:13] light said Paul would have never
[38:18] called that like God if he hadn't
[38:23] know
[38:25] right he said Lord who art
[38:29] thou he knew the evidence the signs the
[38:32] pillar of fire the things he knew that
[38:35] from the study of the word he knew the
[38:37] logos the theophany the things and all
[38:39] of the creation of the world and who
[38:41] done
[38:43] what but yet one day he met that
[38:47] God that's all I'm want me and you to
[38:51] do and just meet that God right and then
[38:55] we'll find out but now getting down to
[38:57] the
[38:59] point the prophet said in our old
[39:04] book we're going to have to recognize it
[39:06] to be
[39:09] gone this is the book he's talking
[39:14] about the record of Our
[39:17] Lives is right here before us that we
[39:21] call the Bible right all right so in
[39:25] that Bible we're going to have to
[39:31] find what happened to
[39:35] us what took place in our
[39:40] lives we can go back and read about
[39:42] these others and their experiences
[39:44] that's
[39:45] wonderful but then we must have an
[39:47] experience of our
[39:50] own not because somebody else had an
[39:56] experience that's why I've always said
[39:58] it and I believe it that there's no way
[40:01] to be born again unless you hear the
[40:03] word amen how could you ever be saved if
[40:06] you didn't hear the
[40:11] word it may be that Jesus Christ died
[40:14] for you right that's the word
[40:20] right but if we can't see the old book
[40:26] Gone
[40:29] and our name actually
[40:33] transferred then we can't see that we're
[40:35] born
[40:38] again all right so the basis we start up
[40:40] on is what that almighty God
[40:43] himself had to come down and give his
[40:47] own
[40:48] life because no other man's life could
[40:51] come back on you and
[40:56] I brother R said it like this he said no
[40:59] man died like that
[41:03] man yet they got the doctrines in the
[41:05] message see that what he was just a
[41:10] man brother R said he was more than a
[41:13] man he said he was almighty
[41:19] God but my God can't
[41:23] die see that's
[41:26] argumentive
[41:28] philosophy organized
[41:31] religion is
[41:33] talking all
[41:36] right but see the new
[41:40] birth I keep making these statements now
[41:42] and I got it written here got it before
[41:44] or later the new birth only deals with
[41:47] the soul of the
[41:50] individual it does not deal with your
[41:53] body and your spirit the new birth Chang
[41:57] changes the nature of that soul to
[42:00] God all right then that Soul motivates
[42:05] are controlled or or you know does the
[42:09] spirit and the spirit the
[42:12] body but you're not born again in your
[42:16] body you're not born again in your
[42:18] spirit right you're only Born Again In
[42:21] Your Soul the only part of us right now
[42:24] that can even possibility be thinking of
[42:26] is of being eternal
[42:27] is the
[42:35] soul then in doing that then God had to
[42:38] come
[42:41] down and he was the only one that can do
[42:44] the things that had to be
[42:47] done all right we talk about him a lot
[42:50] about that he could die for you and I
[42:54] that he could go to hell for you and I
[42:56] right
[42:58] that he could heal
[43:00] us he could deliver
[43:04] us but seemingly now in the latter days
[43:07] of past 30 years very little is talked
[43:11] about salvation of the
[43:12] Soul cuz all the doctrines are struck of
[43:15] how Eternal you are and what you don't
[43:17] need this and you don't need that
[43:21] and there no need talking about the new
[43:24] birth that's old stuff they say
[43:30] well it happens to be the only way into
[43:32] the body of Christ I don't know how old
[43:34] it is matter of fact we we serve the
[43:37] it's the oldest religion there is
[43:39] because it was before the foundation of
[43:40] the world that's what the prophet said
[43:42] about it right so why worry about it
[43:44] being old or are you just old head
[43:47] brother
[43:48] Dale well let me just say that away I'm
[43:51] happy all cuz I love to talk about
[43:55] salvation but
[43:58] now remember this point we'll get back
[44:01] to it later
[44:02] on that the little
[44:05] Eagle even though it was born in the
[44:11] barnyard it ate the things the chicken
[44:15] ate and tried to cluck like the
[44:20] chicken right
[44:25] right we used to have old rabbit and
[44:27] that sucker run around through the yard
[44:29] with the
[44:30] dogs I'm talking about rabbit dogs that
[44:33] was born and raised to kill rabbits and
[44:35] that old rabbit would running around
[44:36] through there he thought he was a
[44:40] dog he he probably wound up tackling the
[44:43] next door neighbor his dog one day and
[44:45] found out he wouldn't know but cuz I
[44:47] don't remember what happened to
[44:49] him but think about
[44:52] it the only
[44:56] voice the little Eagle could
[44:59] hear was his
[45:03] mama
[45:06] right see we talk about having too many
[45:10] husbands when we get down to the law and
[45:13] Grace part of this situation we're going
[45:15] to talk about too many
[45:20] mamas right there is an old mother
[45:23] in the Book of Revelations remember and
[45:25] having Harlot daughters you know and all
[45:26] so we got to get into that
[45:29] eventually but now think about
[45:34] it what did God
[45:39] do he gave his
[45:42] life he paid the price he went to hell
[45:46] and cleansed everything but that wasn't
[45:49] all of
[45:50] it and that have been all he done and
[45:53] went on back to Heaven we'd still been
[45:54] in the same shape MH he could have even
[45:58] driven the unclean Spirit out of the
[46:03] Apostles but that wasn't what it
[46:05] was all of those things that he
[46:10] done the climax of it all was to come
[46:13] and
[46:14] live in the soul of those
[46:21] disciples being healed that's good
[46:24] wonderful being delivered that's
[46:26] wonderful somebody pay my price I don't
[46:28] have to go to hell that's
[46:31] fine but you know Peter then were just
[46:33] as
[46:35] dead they had to go to the upper room
[46:37] and
[46:39] wait then when the Holy Ghost came it
[46:41] gave him a new
[46:44] birth
[46:47] now the dealings this afternoon is going
[46:50] to
[46:51] be thinking about what
[46:55] happened
[46:57] to you and
[47:02] I because there's no way that any of us
[47:04] could think
[47:06] about being perfect we need to realize
[47:13] that perfect is a wonderful
[47:20] condition now listen to my
[47:23] wording which one you want to be perfect
[47:29] or you want to be
[47:37] justified so you don't pay attention to
[47:39] the words I use a lot of times or
[47:40] illustrations a little baby at Spirit
[47:43] and soul is just as perfect as can
[47:49] be
[47:51] right you can be
[47:55] forgiven right
[47:59] but what about being
[48:03] justified oh forgiven Justified that's
[48:06] just a play of words I don't understand
[48:07] you CU I'm just forgiven I'm not perfect
[48:10] but I'm forgiven you see that on tags
[48:14] on if you're perfect then you got to be
[48:19] forgiven but that don't mean you're
[48:24] Justified How could a human
[48:28] being ever come to the thought of
[48:31] thinking
[48:33] about that could be
[48:38] justified cuz you'll find these three
[48:40] things in the invisible
[48:42] Union you'll find brother random
[48:44] explaining
[48:48] Justified he said chops off your
[48:51] sins death of the old
[48:55] husband
[48:57] then he'll say
[49:00] Justified it's as though you never done
[49:02] it
[49:05] right have you noticed that in the
[49:07] message I've asked you to read over and
[49:08] over or listen to the tpe then after a
[49:12] while he
[49:13] says you never done
[49:19] it and that's all under the word
[49:25] Justified
[49:28] that's why when we get into the marriage
[49:29] and divorce you'll see us still using
[49:30] those same
[49:34] quotes you know you'll never be
[49:36] justified in the eyes of
[49:40] man right that's right we're just too
[49:44] carnal or whatever the word would be for
[49:47] we're just too
[49:53] human see you see me and I say
[50:00] that wasn't
[50:01] right brother Dale's
[50:13] mad talking the other day
[50:17] with Brother Martin and him
[50:21] dny believe is who it
[50:25] was do you know Jesus got
[50:29] angry the Bible says it Prophet said
[50:33] it but he didn't get
[50:36] mad a difference in the
[50:40] word he got angry because that
[50:44] they done contrary to his
[50:48] word he planted the ropes and he run him
[50:50] out of the
[50:52] temple I don't like him he's
[50:55] mad
[51:00] see we dechristianize him in a hurry
[51:02] wouldn't
[51:07] we the only thing that I've ever said to
[51:10] prove the difference that he was mad or
[51:11] he was angry he wasn't died for those
[51:14] people proved he wasn't mad that's
[51:17] right the Bible says be angry and sin
[51:20] not right don't let the sun go down on
[51:23] your wrath
[51:25] that's
[51:27] you mean anger is okay I didn't say that
[51:31] right I said Jesus got angry that don't
[51:35] put him in a sinful condition like
[51:38] mankind his anger was over the fact of
[51:40] what they was doing with his
[51:42] word and remember the same God that
[51:47] joyously went to Calvary to die for you
[51:49] and I that if we do not accept him as
[51:51] our savior will'll burn us
[51:54] up in the Lake of Fire am is that
[52:03] anger does he get angry
[52:07] no just because we won't do it but now
[52:13] listen what happened at
[52:18] Calvary that must be
[52:21] applied to you and I
[52:25] today see that's we want to preach about
[52:28] somebody else back there right it done
[52:30] this that done that we got great stories
[52:32] and wait said one day all this is about
[52:34] Abraham and and everything but forget
[52:36] talking about Abraham let's talk about
[52:37] you and
[52:42] me but remember the prophet said that
[52:46] whatever condition was
[52:49] met for the P first person that God
[52:53] healed or saved or
[52:55] Etc said if we meet that condition he's
[52:59] honor bound to save us that's right
[53:02] right that's right well now we know it
[53:04] did happen because we got a book full
[53:07] yes of
[53:11] people you know that done those
[53:14] things what is it the church a book said
[53:16] many of the flaws are the people of the
[53:18] Bible but said God got through and made
[53:21] them
[53:24] perfect but actually what
[53:29] happened I said we we can say he went to
[53:31] hell and paid the price we can say he
[53:33] done all these things but actually what
[53:39] happened well his life came back to live
[53:42] in us that's it right
[53:46] there
[53:47] now then that
[53:50] means that in my
[53:53] soul if I'm born again this afternoon
[53:57] is God has imparted his
[54:00] nature in with my
[54:02] nature because if he took me out put him
[54:05] in I wouldn't be
[54:08] me
[54:11] right I'd be him all right see we look
[54:15] at it some go that way I'm him I'm him
[54:17] oh ain't something being him the other
[54:19] one says I don't believe I'm him yet I
[54:21] don't I just I have problems I I think
[54:24] there ought to be a middle of the road
[54:27] brother R said God partnershi you yep
[54:33] amen if the nature of our soul was the
[54:35] devil and that nature went out did our
[54:39] soul
[54:41] die no just the nature part the
[54:46] motivator then he come in to live so
[54:49] it's he and I together as
[54:52] persons that's why I'm Eternal right
[54:57] because he gave me his life amen all
[55:01] right now then Paul could say if not I
[55:04] that liveth but Christ that liveth in me
[55:06] that's
[55:08] right and the life that I now live by
[55:11] the faith inside
[55:16] soul of God yes he said I'm
[55:21] wonderful so he said I serve God from
[55:24] the heart
[55:28] but said I see other things happening in
[55:31] my
[55:32] members that I'm having trouble bringing
[55:35] under
[55:36] subjection so he was saying the rest of
[55:38] me is
[55:39] not complete yet
[55:42] right now if I don't get down to the
[55:44] finish up of these notes I got it here
[55:46] on it just remember that when you
[55:49] receive the new birth that is still it's
[55:51] just the earnest of your inheritance
[55:53] until the Redemption of the purchased
[55:55] possession
[55:56] the product done purchased everything's
[55:59] done but it's
[56:01] not made manifest
[56:04] yet is that what that
[56:06] means so we only have the earnest that's
[56:10] right probably
[56:11] said that mean it's not means it's not
[56:14] the
[56:15] fullness you
[56:17] know it's only the
[56:20] earnest waiting for that rest of us to
[56:23] be done I try to illustrate it we know
[56:26] it Calvary that Israel was saved at
[56:29] Calvary right everybody that ever be
[56:31] saved was saved at Calvary right Christ
[56:34] was paid finished all but it hadn't been
[56:37] applied
[56:41] yet
[56:43] now but if he come
[56:47] in something had to go out
[56:53] amen and that has to be that old husband
[56:57] amen that a damic nature that we were
[57:00] born with
[57:04] yes now what
[57:09] happened now I'm going to say something
[57:11] I don't even know the words to say it
[57:13] but I hope it'll come out
[57:17] right is this just a thing of receiving
[57:20] eternal
[57:25] life
[57:27] is that all your
[57:31] goal is that the fulfilling of God's
[57:33] plan is for somebody to just receive his
[57:39] life remember foolish virgins will be
[57:42] given eternal
[57:48] life is this just a receiving of eternal
[57:55] life
[58:01] what
[58:04] happened when you was born
[58:15] again my brother he said it one time he
[58:18] said what I care how I get to heaven as
[58:19] long as I get
[58:21] there well that sounds
[58:25] good
[58:27] but you know the whole story is not to
[58:29] just him to die to pay the price of our
[58:30] sins and even come and live in
[58:32] us that's not the whole story right
[58:37] right I thought the story of the Bible
[58:39] was for him to die come live in you and
[58:41] I and then you and
[58:43] I live before others and display and
[58:47] preach the gospel and talk to them about
[58:50] the Lord and you know share our our
[58:53] experiences with God and
[58:58] is it just getting eternal life or is
[59:04] it dealing
[59:06] with something that's very very vital to
[59:09] each and every one of
[59:14] us because to look at the old book being
[59:17] gone is one
[59:20] thing
[59:25] but
[59:26] what happened to that
[59:33] book what happened to that old
[59:38] book of our
[59:43] records let's start right there so go
[59:45] ahead brother and pull up number four
[59:47] and we'll
[59:48] start I've got also this afternoon's
[59:50] quote so if y'all want to stay around on
[59:52] supper time
[59:55] we
[59:57] all
[59:59] right which is the earnest until our
[1:00:02] Redemption okay and we we're number-wise
[1:00:05] off but go ahead with with uh let's see
[1:00:10] wait a
[1:00:12] minute I think I know what would just
[1:00:16] happened yep you're going to have to
[1:00:18] every who's on the board going to have
[1:00:20] to get on the morning's message and
[1:00:22] brother Anderson I gave him both of them
[1:00:26] you're on the evening message come back
[1:00:28] to the morning message all right I I was
[1:00:31] doing that to try to help Brother
[1:00:33] Anderson this morning I gave him copies
[1:00:34] of the morning in the evening and I'd
[1:00:36] already changed some of the morning so
[1:00:38] what we're going to is invisible Union
[1:00:40] paragraph
[1:00:42] 223 and you'll find it real quick
[1:00:44] brother Joe by running it up now your
[1:00:46] old book is gone with your old your old
[1:00:49] Union so that'll run it fast for you but
[1:00:52] now while he's getting there we'll stop
[1:00:55] on well go ahead he's got it now that's
[1:00:58] what I said they can find me in a hurry
[1:00:59] most of the time y'all life at my
[1:01:02] cutting and pasting but I'm in number
[1:01:04] wise instead of trying to find and go
[1:01:09] through now your old book is
[1:01:13] gone with your old
[1:01:17] union now your name and your old in your
[1:01:22] has been
[1:01:24] transferred
[1:01:26] now you say do you mean to tell me that
[1:01:28] my old
[1:01:31] book God put it
[1:01:40] where would somebody tell me where that
[1:01:42] scripture is
[1:01:53] at I'm not I'm just making a
[1:02:00] point somebody find that scripture where
[1:02:04] it's put in the sea of
[1:02:08] forgetfulness not there right brother
[1:02:11] dick not in that
[1:02:19] wording the correct way is that our sins
[1:02:23] is as far as the east is from the
[1:02:29] West see we can pick up scriptures and
[1:02:31] that just that's what it's talking about
[1:02:33] but I'm just want you to think see a lot
[1:02:35] of people would SAR and ARG and tell me
[1:02:37] that's in the Bible it doesn't say see a
[1:02:41] forgetfulness there only time the words
[1:02:43] forgot forgetfulness is one time in the
[1:02:45] Old
[1:02:45] Testament H just shock you make you wake
[1:02:49] up one thing get you to thinking cuz
[1:02:52] when you're thinking it's hard to go to
[1:02:54] sleep amen God put it now I believe that
[1:02:59] scripture right there as much as I
[1:03:01] believe John
[1:03:04] 3:16
[1:03:06] right I believe that scripture as much
[1:03:09] as John 3:16 is scripture CU he had to
[1:03:12] do something with my sins that's
[1:03:17] right now think about what I'm
[1:03:20] saying is this just to receive eternal
[1:03:23] life is it just to be or to get to
[1:03:25] heaven or
[1:03:34] something or is it to serve a
[1:03:38] God that can do something that you and I
[1:03:41] cannot
[1:03:44] do we can
[1:03:47] forgive we can do the best we can to
[1:03:53] forget but we can't do it
[1:03:56] devil won't let us for one
[1:04:01] thing what about a God that can't
[1:04:04] remember
[1:04:08] right so when he paid the price he done
[1:04:16] something
[1:04:18] right more than just coming and living
[1:04:21] in
[1:04:23] mankind you done something
[1:04:31] he put our sins as far as the East is
[1:04:33] from the
[1:04:34] West now you know the reason for that
[1:04:36] don't
[1:04:37] you North is so far there's a North Pole
[1:04:40] and there's a South Pole but there ain't
[1:04:42] no East pole and ain't no West Pole
[1:04:45] right
[1:04:47] right so that means if it was North and
[1:04:50] South you'd have a stopping
[1:04:53] point but brother Eddie if my sins is as
[1:04:56] far as the East to the West that means
[1:04:58] as far as it goes east it just keeps
[1:05:01] coming
[1:05:02] back and as far as it goes that's still
[1:05:04] East it may change the West talking but
[1:05:08] there was just no place to put
[1:05:14] them that's right there's nowhere to put
[1:05:18] them so what are you going to say about
[1:05:21] them what are you going to say about the
[1:05:23] sins of a born again believer
[1:05:28] I'm going to say the best way that I can
[1:05:29] putting that together with all the
[1:05:31] scripture you know we serve a God that
[1:05:33] can
[1:05:35] forget and
[1:05:37] nobody can make him remember it that's
[1:05:40] right that's
[1:05:43] right and you think God don't have
[1:05:47] power amen you got that ability nope
[1:05:49] don't either I don't have it
[1:05:52] either too much memory right
[1:05:56] but when he says I forgive
[1:05:59] you it's
[1:06:01] gone oh God you remember I said years
[1:06:03] ago I going to preach one of these days
[1:06:04] on God with
[1:06:06] amnesia well that that's hard to do
[1:06:08] because he doesn't have
[1:06:10] amnesia the Amnesia is is a fact that
[1:06:13] it's gone from you and there's no way
[1:06:15] you can do it
[1:06:18] God when he put it
[1:06:22] away may I use my human terminology to
[1:06:25] in Georgia he annihilated
[1:06:33] it now you'll see why that R random kept
[1:06:36] saying
[1:06:37] it you can be
[1:06:40] forgiven but not
[1:06:44] justified cuz see nobody's going to ever
[1:06:46] I mean everybody's going to remember
[1:06:47] what you
[1:06:54] done never forget What's Done
[1:07:00] Right God annihilated it he didn't just
[1:07:03] forget
[1:07:04] it that's what I want you to get this
[1:07:06] afternoon I know we won't get much time
[1:07:08] okay okay look what he says God put it
[1:07:11] in the sea of his forgetfulness now as I
[1:07:13] said I believe that scripture just like
[1:07:15] John 3:16 cuz that's exactly what he
[1:07:18] done he put it not in the sea that's an
[1:07:22] illustration brother brandom used the
[1:07:24] illustration of the old man in the
[1:07:26] geography book or what it was you know
[1:07:28] and he was reading it and he saw that in
[1:07:31] places in the ocean that they didn't
[1:07:33] have no bottom you know well you know
[1:07:35] that's a story because there is a
[1:07:38] bottom if it went all the way through
[1:07:40] come out the other side you
[1:07:44] know it's an
[1:07:47] illustration an illustration to the fact
[1:07:52] that it can't be remembered no more
[1:07:56] so the prophet when he called it the Sea
[1:07:57] of his
[1:07:59] forgetfulness that's better than east to
[1:08:02] west that's a human terminology that
[1:08:05] upgrades from east to
[1:08:08] west to where that it can never be found
[1:08:11] right it's in a sea of
[1:08:15] forgetfulness you stand perfectly before
[1:08:17] God it didn't say you stood perfectly
[1:08:19] before
[1:08:21] man the new bir didn't make us no
[1:08:24] different
[1:08:26] except it changed that inward part of us
[1:08:29] it didn't wipe no slate clean that I
[1:08:31] done that's
[1:08:32] right now come on I'm talking about to
[1:08:36] the world
[1:08:38] right the world still knows all I do
[1:08:46] yes but God can't remember
[1:08:54] it
[1:08:56] that's hard to
[1:08:59] comprehend now your name is now in the
[1:09:02] new
[1:09:04] book not the old Book of
[1:09:07] Life okay
[1:09:11] Bible Bible the Old Book of Life told
[1:09:16] Paul's records and what he done showed
[1:09:18] how he Stone Steven you know hell the
[1:09:20] coat
[1:09:24] told
[1:09:28] but
[1:09:30] yet a new book was written when he was
[1:09:33] born
[1:09:34] again not written it's just
[1:09:37] words but the Lamb's Book of Life see
[1:09:41] now your name is not in just
[1:09:44] the regular book of life it's in the
[1:09:46] book of life Lamb's Book of Life what
[1:09:48] the lamb redeemed not the old book of
[1:09:50] your natural Union but your new bride
[1:09:53] Hallelujah your new life is in the L's
[1:09:55] Book of Life your marriage
[1:09:59] certificate Hallelujah all
[1:10:02] right we'll get back on that and on the
[1:10:04] grace of marriage and divorce your
[1:10:07] marriage certificate
[1:10:09] amen okay me and my wife got married 55
[1:10:12] years ago in August coming up and uh you
[1:10:17] know we had to get a marriage
[1:10:20] certificate you
[1:10:22] know a piece of paper telling who
[1:10:25] married who on what date and then the
[1:10:29] guy was a justice of the peace I'm sorry
[1:10:31] cuz we back there with neither one of us
[1:10:33] she went to a Baptist Church I didn't go
[1:10:34] to
[1:10:38] nothing but he put his stamp on there
[1:10:42] you know showing it was done in his home
[1:10:44] had him and his wife and a cat and my
[1:10:47] daddy-in-law
[1:10:52] but he took it overse to the courthouse
[1:10:56] right and he had it officially
[1:11:00] recorded it was then known as a m
[1:11:04] certificant showing that two people had
[1:11:06] been joined
[1:11:09] legally because he was a legal
[1:11:12] representative to be able to seal
[1:11:15] it and he put it to the
[1:11:18] court so
[1:11:20] now your new life is in the lounge Book
[1:11:23] of Life your marriage certificate
[1:11:30] now if that old husband is still
[1:11:33] alive you don't have a marriage
[1:11:37] certificate CU it's not something pay
[1:11:40] for
[1:11:42] work if you're still alive then you're
[1:11:45] still married to the old
[1:11:48] husband
[1:11:51] read but if you got a marriage
[1:11:53] certificate from God
[1:11:57] that means you're married to
[1:12:01] God go that marriage certificate is not
[1:12:04] of an old nature tied up and it's not
[1:12:06] saying on that marriage
[1:12:09] certificate Samuel Dale that was once
[1:12:12] married to his old adamic
[1:12:15] nature we know he's tried to divorce it
[1:12:17] but it doesn't work but I'm going to
[1:12:18] sign him down here and say that he's I'm
[1:12:20] married him now God won't do
[1:12:24] that
[1:12:27] there's no record of the old
[1:12:29] man you don't see it on your marriage
[1:12:31] certificates you go home and look at it
[1:12:33] so and so and so and so and so and so
[1:12:35] and so so and so and so and so it's not
[1:12:37] on there like that it just tells you got
[1:12:39] married but look Hallelujah where your
[1:12:42] true Eternal germ from the beginning
[1:12:44] takes hold now you're not only
[1:12:48] forgiven but you're
[1:12:54] Justified you're not only forgiven but
[1:12:56] you're
[1:13:02] Justified according to Romans
[1:13:06] 5:1 you're
[1:13:10] Justified now we've heard this probably
[1:13:12] 5,000 times at it what does Justified
[1:13:17] mean we've read that over and over go
[1:13:20] ahead and run it on up onto the next
[1:13:21] through 25 because this will be
[1:13:23] continuous reading for a little bit he
[1:13:25] said' look up the
[1:13:27] word Look up the word
[1:13:30] Justified it does not mean
[1:13:33] forgiven the word means
[1:13:37] Justified it don't mean you're
[1:13:45] forgiven you say well I was forgiven of
[1:13:47] my
[1:13:50] sins all
[1:13:52] right the Lord forgave me one wonderful
[1:13:55] but what did he do with
[1:13:58] them now I've always made myself plain
[1:14:01] even on one thing if you just a person
[1:14:04] coming to Salvation at justification and
[1:14:07] you ask God to forgive
[1:14:11] you he can never bring that up
[1:14:16] again that's how much I believe it amen
[1:14:19] amen I've always tried to tell you the
[1:14:22] husband and wife situation marital
[1:14:24] problems you know that you've got
[1:14:27] had you're a poor discrepant human being
[1:14:31] on my
[1:14:32] terminologies if you bring up the past
[1:14:35] and try to you know well you're not the
[1:14:38] husband like my first husband was he was
[1:14:41] good to
[1:14:43] me our wife vice
[1:14:48] versa when you start comparing
[1:14:53] things you're
[1:14:55] worse than a hypocrite that's right now
[1:14:59] brother Dell is angry cuz I don't like
[1:15:02] stuff like
[1:15:04] that if you ask me to forgive you it'll
[1:15:08] never be mentioned
[1:15:10] again
[1:15:15] amen well I just can't do it that way
[1:15:17] Brother D well what you need is a new
[1:15:20] birth
[1:15:23] plain but you know what I'm talking
[1:15:26] about that's what's wrong with
[1:15:31] families
[1:15:33] right people marry and remarry and
[1:15:35] everything then she's got her kids he's
[1:15:38] got his kids then they got their kids
[1:15:41] and you got a kid
[1:15:43] problem cuz he don't want her correcting
[1:15:46] his and she don't want him correcting
[1:15:47] hers and then he don't know how to
[1:15:49] correct or
[1:15:50] wrong cu the one standing in the middle
[1:15:53] says you didn't treat them that way you
[1:15:54] didn't treat that
[1:15:56] way you got hell on Earth the best way
[1:15:59] to say it
[1:16:03] that's but see even to say
[1:16:09] forgiven do you understand what I'm
[1:16:13] saying that if you ask me to forgive
[1:16:19] you and I say yes I accept
[1:16:21] it that'll never be mentioned again
[1:16:30] why because that's just human that's me
[1:16:32] just plain old human
[1:16:37] nature cuz you see that's where people
[1:16:39] do it oh yeah oh yeah I forgive
[1:16:46] you now I'm not dumb I've always told
[1:16:49] you that I'd forgive my wife if she come
[1:16:52] and told me something but I I don't want
[1:16:55] her telling me the next week the same
[1:16:56] story again with somebody
[1:16:58] else now that's gets where I don't
[1:17:00] forgive a lot all right and I'd expect
[1:17:04] her to be that
[1:17:06] way when I said I'm not
[1:17:09] done but even
[1:17:16] forgiven did God say okay I forgive you
[1:17:18] but I'm going to put them under a hole
[1:17:20] little place over here and I'm going to
[1:17:21] remember
[1:17:23] them and when you go to the white Throne
[1:17:26] I'm going to bring them
[1:17:28] up I don't believe in that kind of a God
[1:17:30] maybe you do it's what I said even if
[1:17:33] you just repented of your sins and if
[1:17:35] you truly repented now really meant it
[1:17:37] and said God forgive me it's white slate
[1:17:40] clean sir it's not put in a cubicle to
[1:17:43] be brought up later or run up on a
[1:17:45] computer somewhere to be push a button
[1:17:47] and get back later with
[1:17:49] you that's
[1:17:52] right it's gone amen
[1:17:57] that's the kind of God I serve
[1:18:01] am look what he
[1:18:04] says explaining or
[1:18:08] illustrating what the word Justified
[1:18:10] means it it don't mean you're forgiven
[1:18:14] watch it for instance you heard I got
[1:18:15] drunk and done some evil things and
[1:18:17] everything and then you come around and
[1:18:19] say to me now watch it you found out I
[1:18:21] didn't do them now that's out on most
[1:18:25] people quot it see other words you said
[1:18:28] you go out and tell that I was dranking
[1:18:30] I've done this then you find out I
[1:18:32] didn't do
[1:18:33] it you found it
[1:18:38] out then you come around and say brother
[1:18:40] random I forgive
[1:18:45] you you know I didn't do it and you're
[1:18:49] going to forgive me what a flimsy excuse
[1:18:53] of forgiveness is it
[1:18:56] you know I didn't do it sister Gail and
[1:18:58] then you turn around later and forgive
[1:18:59] me for doing it that ain't even common
[1:19:05] sense then you come around and say
[1:19:07] brother ROM I forgive forgive me didn't
[1:19:10] do it first
[1:19:11] place and you know I didn't do
[1:19:14] it the biggest problem is we did do all
[1:19:17] of it the devil knows we
[1:19:20] did and he keeps accusing
[1:19:23] us and we know we done it the neighbor
[1:19:26] knows we done
[1:19:29] it used to be a little old paper done at
[1:19:31] home called Anderson
[1:19:34] Independent if you wanted Georgia news
[1:19:37] all you had to do is get the Anderson
[1:19:38] Independent they had more Georgia news
[1:19:39] in it it did anything in South
[1:19:42] Carolina I always said if you want some
[1:19:44] gossip just go read to Anderson
[1:19:46] Independent cuz they're going to be
[1:19:48] telling about
[1:19:49] everybody but
[1:19:52] listen now if I did do
[1:19:57] it I'm
[1:20:00] guilty if I did do it but you could
[1:20:03] forgive
[1:20:05] me I wouldn't be guilty to you
[1:20:12] right I wouldn't be guilty that's only
[1:20:16] to
[1:20:18] you because I did
[1:20:21] it but yet I'm not justified
[1:20:25] because I actually done
[1:20:28] it but the word Justified is as though
[1:20:31] you never done
[1:20:33] it now who can do that except
[1:20:36] God
[1:20:39] amen amen is not even
[1:20:43] regarded at
[1:20:47] all how is it
[1:20:50] done how is it that is not regarded
[1:20:54] there's your key to what he's
[1:20:57] saying it's not even regarded at all
[1:21:01] how's it
[1:21:02] done in God's book of the sea of
[1:21:06] forgetfulness your old book and marriage
[1:21:09] is
[1:21:12] divorced and
[1:21:16] dead it's not even in the
[1:21:19] memories of
[1:21:23] God I wish I could do
[1:21:26] that amen you are Justified therefore
[1:21:29] being
[1:21:32] justified it was
[1:21:34] accused you was
[1:21:37] accused you never done it in the first
[1:21:42] place now that's stronger than doing it
[1:21:46] and wiping a slate
[1:21:49] clean right remember what I told you to
[1:21:52] look up told you to read
[1:21:55] Justified you done it chopped it
[1:22:00] off second
[1:22:04] stage you done it you was justified as
[1:22:08] though you never done it right third
[1:22:11] stage you never done
[1:22:14] it why because you're dealing with the
[1:22:16] memories of
[1:22:20] God all right he wasn't married to it to
[1:22:24] begin with
[1:22:25] with that's pretty good doing getting
[1:22:27] rid of the old
[1:22:30] husband the bridegroom bore your shame
[1:22:34] himself for you in your place he took
[1:22:37] your place for you were predestinated to
[1:22:39] him to be in his bride before the
[1:22:41] foundation of the world the Bible said
[1:22:44] so you are the predestinated
[1:22:49] seed well how did you come to do
[1:22:53] this
[1:22:57] in other words you've done it we're
[1:22:59] guilty right how did we come to do
[1:23:04] it you were deceived into it by your
[1:23:07] first marriage to your adulterous parent
[1:23:11] Eve it's no fault of your own by your
[1:23:15] natural birth you come after Eve who
[1:23:16] committed adultery that's a reason you
[1:23:18] were born in
[1:23:20] adulteries born in sin s right you're a
[1:23:23] sinner to begin with that's right you
[1:23:25] was deceived into it you had no you it
[1:23:28] ain't your fault you never did it
[1:23:31] because that little germ that was in you
[1:23:33] was to be you before the foundation of
[1:23:35] the world God put your name in the
[1:23:37] lounge book of
[1:23:39] life
[1:23:41] now if Justified
[1:23:47] means what it says it
[1:23:53] means then
[1:23:58] God through some
[1:24:02] way of his only SEC of his own secret
[1:24:05] Mysteries I'd call
[1:24:07] it has the
[1:24:12] ability do not remember amen what we
[1:24:19] do and if you never done it to start
[1:24:23] with
[1:24:26] he's got to have a
[1:24:28] memory that
[1:24:30] can remember that you never done
[1:24:35] it you said what are you talking
[1:24:39] about I thought the Bible said that he
[1:24:41] stood as a lamb slain before the
[1:24:43] foundation of the
[1:24:48] world sin in the presence of God is
[1:24:51] automatic Annihilation right
[1:24:56] that's why he had to come down and pay
[1:24:59] the
[1:25:00] price before he could stand with Adam
[1:25:02] and Eve in his
[1:25:11] presence are you following me
[1:25:15] yes see then he never did see what Adam
[1:25:18] and Eve
[1:25:21] done come on I want you to approach it
[1:25:23] some other way and show me how he can do
[1:25:25] this or that or the
[1:25:28] other I thought we believe that the
[1:25:31] blood is what covers
[1:25:34] Us I thought we believe that the blood
[1:25:37] that we're not saved by the blood but
[1:25:38] we're kept saved by the blood because
[1:25:40] it's an offering of Pardon
[1:25:47] of you see the part of you that never
[1:25:50] done it is in that Soul right amen
[1:25:54] but yet that Soul did do
[1:25:57] it yet it was
[1:25:59] lost but God made it to the point that
[1:26:01] he never
[1:26:05] remembered you mean brother Dale he can
[1:26:07] remember some things but he can't
[1:26:09] remember
[1:26:14] others you have to talk to him about
[1:26:17] it I'm just trying to quote scripture to
[1:26:20] you and talk to you about what the
[1:26:21] prophet would
[1:26:23] say that the word Justified
[1:26:26] means you done it it's
[1:26:31] gone second time you done
[1:26:39] it it says though you never done it then
[1:26:42] you come up to the point of three
[1:26:46] things that a real you I like to title
[1:26:49] it that
[1:26:51] way cuz I tried to do that probably 40
[1:26:54] years years ago I've tried to talk about
[1:26:56] the real
[1:26:58] you the real you is not the person I'm
[1:27:01] looking at brother around and said
[1:27:02] you've never seen me he said you see the
[1:27:06] body that I inhabit
[1:27:08] righten he said that real me is that man
[1:27:11] that's inside that you can't see
[1:27:17] right but yet we come into the world
[1:27:20] lost and
[1:27:23] sinners see God can't accuse you of
[1:27:25] something you didn't
[1:27:30] do we know we done
[1:27:35] it but he just takes it just takes it
[1:27:38] cowly out of
[1:27:40] existence
[1:27:44] am you know the story that the
[1:27:46] illustration the prophet uses of the man
[1:27:48] that killed the King's
[1:27:51] son and they were going to kill him mhm
[1:27:55] he goes down and talks to him you know
[1:27:56] and the man said I'm
[1:27:57] sorry fit of rage I killed
[1:28:00] him he goes back and he sends a chariot
[1:28:04] down rolls out a
[1:28:07] carpet walks up and has them to clean
[1:28:10] him up and bring him out said put this
[1:28:13] robe
[1:28:14] on but do we really listen to the rest
[1:28:16] of that
[1:28:19] story he said go down there and destroy
[1:28:21] all the
[1:28:23] records
[1:28:26] said you're my
[1:28:28] son do we really listen to
[1:28:34] that don't you realize the whole story
[1:28:36] would be
[1:28:38] then my son never
[1:28:41] existed you are my
[1:28:47] son God knew before the foundation of
[1:28:50] world who wouldd be saved and who
[1:28:51] wouldn't that's
[1:28:53] right he knew who' accept him as Savior
[1:28:56] and he knew who he'd give the baptism of
[1:28:58] the Holy Ghost
[1:29:00] to how did we come to do it we're
[1:29:02] deceived into it we come to this earth
[1:29:04] our adulterous
[1:29:06] parents brought us into the
[1:29:12] world but yet God don't never see
[1:29:16] it a man that's born of God a Son of God
[1:29:19] has to have the nature of God he has to
[1:29:22] be like God he honors God he is a part
[1:29:24] of the word of God and in this last days
[1:29:27] of this bride taken form exactly the
[1:29:30] same power that he was at the beginning
[1:29:32] has come up through these organizations
[1:29:34] and so forth come out for the bride he
[1:29:38] can't be nothing else but
[1:29:42] that go to 262 going to number
[1:29:47] seven the bridegroom took away your
[1:29:49] shame and put it in the sea of
[1:29:51] forgetfulness by what by the washing
[1:29:54] of the water of the
[1:29:56] word
[1:29:58] now what does that mean
[1:30:02] now that means that I did have a
[1:30:08] book I did have a
[1:30:12] book and all of my things was written in
[1:30:16] it but some
[1:30:21] way he took as we used to do old
[1:30:24] fireplaces and things in the houses he
[1:30:27] took a little white
[1:30:28] wash and totally annihilated all of it
[1:30:32] but you see we couldn't come up with
[1:30:34] enough to cover all that because it'
[1:30:35] bleed back
[1:30:38] through but he just annihilated our
[1:30:44] sins songs are songs but there's a good
[1:30:47] one that says what sins are you talking
[1:30:49] about that's a good
[1:30:52] song If God has forgiven what sins how
[1:30:55] did he do it well we're just so good
[1:30:57] till he just come down and
[1:31:00] he that's what I say a moment
[1:31:03] ago is it just to have eternal life or
[1:31:06] is it just to go to
[1:31:09] heaven or to realize here what he's
[1:31:15] done he's washed us with the water of
[1:31:18] the
[1:31:22] word
[1:31:25] that's why Faith cometh by hearing
[1:31:26] hearing by the word that's why the
[1:31:28] preachers are here to preach it the
[1:31:29] preacher is supposed to be washing you
[1:31:31] with the
[1:31:33] word but what I hear most of them doing
[1:31:35] is condemning you for what you
[1:31:37] do or the other side is praising you for
[1:31:39] how much Glory you are and they're
[1:31:42] leaving out to
[1:31:45] washing how would you have liked to
[1:31:48] B uh
[1:31:52] Aaron and they finished the
[1:31:57] temple they got ready and they got all
[1:31:59] of the things ready to make the
[1:32:01] sacrifice Moses said Aaron just walk in
[1:32:04] there and make a
[1:32:06] sacrifice uhoh that wasn't the story was
[1:32:10] it God had done told him what to do to
[1:32:15] Aaron Aaron was Washed by the Water of
[1:32:19] the word Moses took step by step and you
[1:32:23] better believe if I'd have been Aaron
[1:32:25] I'd have said Moses did you leave out
[1:32:28] anything you know that's right did you
[1:32:31] forget one little
[1:32:35] thing because if it did I'm going to
[1:32:39] die washing of the water of the word
[1:32:41] what do you think we're doing here every
[1:32:46] service you're cleansed by the washing
[1:32:48] of the water of the
[1:32:52] word
[1:32:55] and the blood of
[1:32:56] life cuz you just don't put the wash in
[1:32:59] by itself it's the blood of Life cover
[1:33:00] it that's what the Bible said your first
[1:33:02] husband that you were married to the
[1:33:04] world the anointed bridegroom which for
[1:33:07] ordained you has washed you by the
[1:33:10] washing of the Water by the
[1:33:14] church that don't sound right he said
[1:33:16] that you might find that in the almanac
[1:33:19] but not in God's Bible by the washing of
[1:33:21] the Water by the word in the word by the
[1:33:25] you are standing completely
[1:33:28] Justified as though you never did it at
[1:33:31] the
[1:33:33] beginning and that's what the new birth
[1:33:36] does this is my message to the church
[1:33:38] now as we go off the hour just in a
[1:33:40] minute you're standing standing on if
[1:33:42] you're standing on God's word and with
[1:33:45] God's word every amen every dot jot
[1:33:49] every tile where you're stand where
[1:33:52] you're standing I'm trying to tell you
[1:33:54] pull away from those Shucks them
[1:33:57] Shucks man's ideas and get out here into
[1:34:01] the wheat where you can get ripe before
[1:34:04] the sun I hear the coming of the combine
[1:34:07] that's the World Council of churches if
[1:34:09] you need that explanation you're
[1:34:11] standing complete Justified like you
[1:34:14] never did it in the first place
[1:34:16] Hallelujah talk about of Thanksgiving he
[1:34:18] said I feel real
[1:34:22] good you are the the pure virtuous
[1:34:24] sinless Bride of the son of the Living
[1:34:26] God every man and woman that's born of
[1:34:29] the spirit of God and washed in the
[1:34:32] blood of Jesus Christ and believes every
[1:34:35] word of God stands as though you never
[1:34:37] sinned at the first place you're perfect
[1:34:40] the blood of Jesus Christ how can
[1:34:43] you
[1:34:48] perfect
[1:34:50] Justified not just forgiven
[1:34:56] forgiven will not bring you the new
[1:35:01] birth you don't understand that word I
[1:35:03] used it if you're forgiven that's
[1:35:07] fine that's means you've done it that
[1:35:09] means a record still left of it that
[1:35:11] means it's all there but if you're
[1:35:14] Justified there's no record
[1:35:18] right could you try my daddy that died
[1:35:21] about
[1:35:22] 1945 could you trying for a crime
[1:35:27] today
[1:35:29] no why because he's been dead all them
[1:35:33] years but you see church that's what we
[1:35:35] need to
[1:35:37] be is dead to ourselves right and that's
[1:35:41] the new
[1:35:42] birth we're not talking about the great
[1:35:45] height of even stature of a perfect man
[1:35:47] and the doings and why you need
[1:35:50] Temperance and
[1:35:52] things we're talking
[1:35:56] about in the
[1:35:58] soul you're Eternal come on
[1:36:02] brothers in the soul of an individual
[1:36:04] that's born again you're
[1:36:07] Eternal there's no
[1:36:13] record did God take out and tear out the
[1:36:16] pages of Paul's letter where he admitted
[1:36:19] what he was
[1:36:22] no
[1:36:28] no you know our problem is one thing and
[1:36:31] I'll end it but this is a
[1:36:33] thought we condemn
[1:36:42] ourselves the greatest problem is self-
[1:36:48] condemnation yes we condemn ourselves
[1:36:52] yes when God don't condemn
[1:36:56] us you said the Lord condemn me I'll
[1:36:59] show you where the Prophet said you get
[1:37:01] condemned that that's
[1:37:03] fine well because he
[1:37:06] guilty but just
[1:37:12] remember if you bring condemnation to to
[1:37:15] far you're going
[1:37:17] to end it for
[1:37:21] all but just remember if you're born
[1:37:23] again it don't give you a license to
[1:37:25] steal that's still that old body and
[1:37:30] spirit ain't got nothing to do with the
[1:37:33] soul amen the soul is totally
[1:37:40] justified it means it never was
[1:37:43] guilty the real you is the baptism of
[1:37:46] the Holy Ghost that's living inside of
[1:37:49] you that's the real
[1:37:52] you
[1:37:54] and that real you never did do
[1:37:59] anything you realize
[1:38:03] then why a lot of
[1:38:05] people never get born
[1:38:10] again is
[1:38:12] because they'll never accept what God
[1:38:15] has done right yes I I've seen thousands
[1:38:20] except Jesus
[1:38:22] Christ
[1:38:26] yeah but how come he didn't say except
[1:38:34] then you see Church the reason a lot of
[1:38:36] people are not saved is the same
[1:38:38] illustration they used those people in
[1:38:41] the book of Acts couldn't get that Holy
[1:38:43] Ghost to come on them
[1:38:48] people they had to send for somebody
[1:38:52] else
[1:38:54] somebody that knew
[1:38:57] amen that's right not that these others
[1:38:59] didn't know they had experienced it and
[1:39:02] were Christians
[1:39:08] themselves but what if some of them was
[1:39:14] James that there's two jameses in the
[1:39:17] book of Acts there in the scriptures
[1:39:20] James the Lesser and James the Greater
[1:39:24] you know what James wanted them to
[1:39:27] do now you say but that's not the whole
[1:39:29] story well you tell me the
[1:39:32] story suppose that was
[1:39:36] James James wanted them to get
[1:39:46] circumcised brother rman never said
[1:39:48] James wasn't a
[1:39:51] Christian he was a
[1:39:58] Christian but he wanted them to get
[1:40:05] circumcised he wanted the Apostle Paul
[1:40:07] to take a
[1:40:12] vow may not be James but it was one of
[1:40:17] them he said
[1:40:19] Paul would you take a vow and go through
[1:40:22] these things with it these to
[1:40:24] prove to them
[1:40:27] Pharisees that you're not against
[1:40:33] them Paul said I'll do
[1:40:37] anything he just never made it to the
[1:40:40] finish of The Vow read the book of Acts
[1:40:44] he never made
[1:40:49] it see because somebody come up and
[1:40:54] busted the whole story open Paul was
[1:40:57] going to go along with it but he was
[1:40:59] certainly going to tell them Pharisees
[1:41:00] about Jesus
[1:41:03] Christ that was his intentions I believe
[1:41:07] he said I'll go along with all this
[1:41:08] cleansing I'll go along with all this to
[1:41:10] show that I'm not against the
[1:41:18] law I don't think he would have went
[1:41:20] along with too much do you he'd got to
[1:41:24] preaching and he never would have make
[1:41:28] it do you understand
[1:41:32] yes why wouldn't that Holy Ghost come on
[1:41:35] those
[1:41:37] people somebody approached it
[1:41:45] wrong brother Rand said don't you get
[1:41:48] down there with them people and try to
[1:41:50] make them speak in
[1:41:52] tongues we don't never hear that quoted
[1:41:55] do
[1:41:56] we he said because you'll turn their
[1:41:59] mind paraphrasing it you'll get their
[1:42:00] mind off of what they're
[1:42:04] doing and they won't never get nothing
[1:42:06] from
[1:42:16] God but see we got all of that laying in
[1:42:18] our minds and our thoughts but I hope
[1:42:21] one thing comes out of this today if
[1:42:23] about this is five Services now spit on
[1:42:26] one
[1:42:27] thing we've got to be born again and if
[1:42:31] we're not born again our old book is
[1:42:33] still alive and we're not justified we
[1:42:37] may be
[1:42:39] forgiven but we're not totally justified
[1:42:42] but ever born again believer read it
[1:42:45] Prophet said ever born again believer
[1:42:47] stands totally justified as though you
[1:42:51] never done it that's right
[1:42:58] see that real you inside of there didn't
[1:43:00] do
[1:43:01] it that old you that old husband did but
[1:43:05] we got to be married Paul says in Romans
