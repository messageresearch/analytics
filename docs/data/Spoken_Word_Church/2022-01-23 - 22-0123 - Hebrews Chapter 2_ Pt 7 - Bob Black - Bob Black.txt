========================================

jesus could be back in the house of the lord we'll keep going through the book of hebrews we just had such a wonderful time yesterday and just come expecting for more more from god this morning so just to recap a little bit like where we left off last time we uh we we stopped at verse 16 and chapter two around about that and paul was saying for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham and we know that that god gave all of those promises that in genesis to this to the seed to thy seed and and speaking of of the inheritance of the land and all the spiritual promises that he gave to him and and and paul would say in galatians 3 16 not to not he saith not into seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ and so we know we know that the promise of that that promise of the seed of abraham is is wrapped up in in everything that jesus christ accomplished but you know there there's a law in the bible that when you when you plant a seed it's going to every seed bringeth forth of its own kind and and maybe if you meditate on that why why does every seed bring forth of its own kind if you plant corn in the ground why does it come up corn if you plant apple or apple seed why is it was it going to come up with apple tree and the reason is because of the life down on the inside of that so with the life the life is really the thing that we're talking about so that uh you if you plant uh if you plant uh the word of god and it begins to spring up within you it's going to bring up bring forth the same life that was in jesus christ and that's how we have access we have access by the new birth by those promises that god gave to us through christ we have access to that same life that was in christ in other words the same life that the same one that called abraham and told him to turn aside and lead him and go through his journey that same one that was was talking to him and dealing with him as the same one that it lives in us now and if we go to the next slide in galatians 3 28 and paul says there is neither you nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus and if you be christ then are ye abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so that means if you're in christ then you've got that same life in you and then you've got access to all the promises and that should be an encouragement to every believer that when you get in a rough spot you lay those promises before god and and say with faith the same kind of faith that the the the reason that you can believe like abraham is because you've got that life in you that life is in in you is is is really what does the believe in what paul said the life that i now live i live by the faith of the son of god you're living by his faith because you've got that same life then now you have the ability to believe you've got the ability to believe like abraham and to look to the unseen not to the things that you see but you're looking past the things that are visible to you and you're looking to the promises of god and that's a a promise that we can lay hold to in this hour and when we see see lots of calamities and lots of bad things uh that somebody was telling me the other day it looks like um we're on the brink of of something with rusher and all all sorts of things happening but yet we're not looking to the things that we can see with our visible eye but we're looking to the promises of god and we have a promise that there's going to be a rapture we have a promise for healing and all these things that are laying in god's word that you can lay claim to because we are the seed of abraham we can when we when we pray for one another and when we go praying for our family we can we can lay claim to those promises saying god we we are the seed of abraham now if the evidence of that if we go to the next slide the evidence of that seed of abraham is that if in matthew chapter 23 23 it says but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word so if you receive that seed into the good ground just like just like any seed you plant the seed and and then down in the inside that seed has got the life so the life has to break through free and like brother branham was just talking about in that sermon if there's got to be a dying out so that crust that that all the all your ideas and everything on the outside of that shell of the of the seed just dies out and then they can the life can come forth so if the life if you've received and then you've died out to your own ideas and and that life springs forth in you then then god begins to open up the word to you which is why it says he that receives seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it the word begins to open up to you how do you understand because that same life that was in the same life that wrote the bible is now in you to reveal the bible which also beareth forth fruit and bringeth forth someone hundredfold some 60 some 30. and in first john 3 9 it says whosoever is born of god does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god so if that seed is received if you've received that seed and the life springs up within your soul then in your soul you cannot doubt god's word in your soul you're you're you're believing god you're you're you're a believer i mean you're in your spirit and in in your in your spirit realm there's there's battles and things the greatest battle ever fought but down on the inside his seed remaineth in him that life is there and once that life is there you can't be lost you're you're you're you're sealed away because the seed remaineth in it it's it's in there now on the next slide brother brown said and he swore by himself and down now who is the seed of abraham those who are filled with the holy ghost are seeds of abraham because you've got the life the life is in you now the next verse we're just breaking down the things that paul preached about in the next verse in in verse 17 he said wherefore now what paul is getting into he's talking about how there's a there's a there was a gap between us and god there's there was something between us and now he god came and and and veiled himself in flesh and went through all of the acts and things of dying on the cross so that that gap could be closed so that we could be in oneness with god again and so paul's saying wherefore in all things that behoove them to be made like unto his brethren to come down and veil robe himself in flesh and to be like us and go through the same things that we get a headache and get get you know maybe have a a maybe have a cold and fevers and flus and whatever all the things of life so that he can know how to succour us as paul would say how to how to how to help us and he said that he might be a faith merciful and faithful high priest and things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people reconciliation is closing up that gap but how did he do it so paul's you'll find a lot a lot through he the book of hebrews paul talks about a high priest and and what what was the high priest now high priest was the he was the spiritual leader of israel he was the one that you know everybody would kind of turn to for guidance and now now think about all these types as they're typing christ he's the only one that could wear the urim and thumb the urine thumb which means it's kind of a strange word it means lights and uh um perfections i i drew a blank there for a second lights and perfections uh urum thumb so so on this on his breastplate he had those 12 stones and and if anybody had any question about a dream that they had or or um a prophecy to find out whether it was really true they would go to that high priest now now think about that now to find out whether whether something's true we go to the word which is christ so now we go we go to the word to find out whether things are true or not now back then they would go to the to the priests and they would say that the thing that had happened in front of that urim thumb or flash across there to indicate that it was true now and and then at the death of the high priest that you remember the stories of the this all the cities of refuge that if you had done killed somebody accidentally then you could run to that city of refuge and you had to stay there stay there until the high priest died but once the high priest died you could go free but now see when christ died on the cross we could all go free we we're maybe gonna back then you'd hide in that city of refuge and you you'd uh you'd you know you you couldn't go out of the city and it would be a bad situation for you maybe you'd want to go see your your family and your relatives and you had to wait until christ until the high priest died which was a type of christ and then again another thing that the high priest would do is every year he offered a sacrifice for himself and the people on the day of atonement now that's the major thing the that's the really the major thing that you focus on when you're talking about a high priest and paul would kind of he would reiterate that as he as he goes through hebrews that christ was our high priest and he he's the one that paid the pride now let's let's meditate on what the high priest would do on the day of atonement if we go to the next slide at leviticus chapter 16 it says he shall take of the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his fingers seven times so and then it says then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring his blood within the veil and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat so that every year once a year everybody would be in great expectation for uh for the for the sin problem to be taken care of and so the priest the high priest on that on the day of atonement yom kippur once a year he would he would go in and out and that's that's the point that paul keeps making that christ died once for all once he every year the high priest had to do that over and over again but christ died once for all and he paid the paid the price so you don't have to keep doing things over and over you don't have to keep repenting you don't have to keep going back to camp meetings you don't he he prayed the price he did it once uh and and and so on every year the high priest would have to go through this this thing again and and then and then on that day he would go in and out four times in and out first of time he would go in to offer up the the incense which was a type of the prayers of the priests and the prayers of the saints offering up that incense and then he go out then he'd go in and offer the blood of that bullock and he'd sprinkle it seven times and that was a type of of a that was to to to to cover the sins of the of the high priest and the priests and then he would go and they would do remember the scapegoat he would they would they would he would go back out and they would they had their two goats and they would cast a lot and see which which coat would go free and carry your sins away into the wilderness and which goat would die and its blood would be sprinkled on the mercy seat now both times for the bullock the bullock and the goat that they with the blood will be sprinkled he'd go into that mercy seat and sprinkle it seven times ephesus smyrna thyatira on down until you get to lay out a sea and he'd sprinkle it because that blood on the mercy seat the most where's the mercy mercy seat where god is tabernacling himself and so when that blood is on the mercy seat is paying the price for you why what's paul talking about so you can be reconciled so that you cannot not be separate from god so that you can like like what we were just talking about that had the seed of abraham living in you so that christ can come and dwell in you so the price had to be paid and all these things that that the high priest was going through were a type of what christ did for us and that's what paul's laying out he's trying to express to the hebrews that we're not just believing in some fable we're believing in something and you really when you begin to meditate on all these complex intricacies in the old testament the way that the the veil was made and all the things that were in the veil and all the things that were made in the tabernacle all these things were speaking of christ and it just when the when the word begins to be revealed to you all this mystery begins to be unfolded that we're not just believing in some fable we're believing in something true it because it that mystery unfolds into something real that we know because because not just because it's because it's been revealed to us and because everything just ties together so perfectly into just a great big harmony of truths laying there in the scripture about how he sprinkled seven times and about what the the scapegoat means and and you think too christ christ typed he typed not only the sacrifice the sacrifice dying there and his blood being shared and sprinkled on the mercy seat but he also typed the high priest so he's typing he's fulfilling everything the whole picture is christ then shall he kill the go to the sin offering that is for the people and bring his blood within the veil and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat now on the in the next if we go to the next slide so to make reconciliation for the sins of the people now what's reconciliation in romans chapter 8 verse 5 to 7 paul said again paul speaking he said for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit so there's there's an enmity problem there's a gap between you and god if you're carnally minded you're going to think about the world you're going to think they're so like like we were talking to the to the to the kids last night about the rich young ruler coming to jesus the rich young ruler wanted to be good he was concerned about being good but but if you're carnally minded there's there's no way to be good well if you want to be good the only way to be to truly be good is to have to be spiritually minded to have the the life of christ in you so paul's saying for to be carnally minded as death but to be spiritually minded as life and peace to be spiritually minded to have the mind of christ in you and when you receive the word and it's quicker than you it will transform your mind so that you you don't love the things that you used to do that's why paul said because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither can neither indeed can be it's not subject to the law of god but a spiritually minded is what's what is subject to the law of god when you're subject to the law of god you begin to kind of get under under the headship of the word and so if the word says you need to dress a certain way or do a certain way then you start doing that if the word says you need to you need to come to church and be seated around fellowship with other people you begin to get under that and you begin you're under the authority of it because you're subject to the law of god now think about what reconcile means to reconcile somebody if we go to the next slide to reconcile means to restore friendly relations between so like you know if you've got a a man and a woman that they've been married for a long time and they kind of get begin to fall out of relation maybe maybe they get separated maybe they're going through a rough spot but then maybe they begin to think on well we've had we've had the children like brother ram told that story of the the mother and father that were looking at the little baby booties in the attic and they begin to they begin to realize that these children came from us from our union and they started getting reconciled reconcile means to to bring back together to bring back together in harmony he said it means to cause to coexist in harmony to make or show to be compatible so if you're reconciled you can walk together you can walk together in lockstep and really what we're talking about is to be to be able to have the same mind to think the same way that god wants to know what he wants what his purpose for us in our life is is to to to to be able to to to know how how to be born again and how to walk as a christian that god wants you to be adopted he wants you to be mature and all of those things that's being reconciled so brother brown and the lamb and the dove he said when this dove came from the heavens the meekest bird of all he's talking about there on when john the baptist was baptizing jesus he came to the meekest animal on earth on all the earth heaven and earth kissed heaven and earth kissed each other now there's reconciliation when heaven and earth can come together now you think about in matthew chapter 3 john when john the baptist began to preach the bible says he started preaching the kingdom of earth is at hand and matthew chapter 4 when jesus started preaching the bible says he started saying the kingdom of earth is at hand now what does that mean it means that heaven and earth are coming together that they're reconciled so in heaven when the life of god is little dwelling inside you well first of all the life of christ the life of christ was dwelling in in that man so so heaven and earth kissed one another because they came together and then god puts that same life in you and it's reconciling he's reconciled so that heaven and earth could come together by the deeds that that high priest did by by his death on the cross that he he died for us now now there on the river jordan uh brother ram said heaven and earth was united together man and god was reconciled in one body the lord jesus christ it was the god of heaven in the form of dove the god of heaven in the form of a dove and the son of god in the form of lamb and there they came together right there on the river jordan type in something reconciliation now reconciliation runs all through the bible and you might remember this from the teaching on the on daniel 70 weeks but we'll go to the next slide what's the what's the third fold of the six-fold purpose to make reconciliation for iniquity so the 144 000 are there they had they had uh you know they began to recognize what what had happened that they killed the messiah and and and you know what iniquity is is when you when you when you come you're faced with what you should do and you walk away from it or what you should not do and you say well i don't i'm not going to do that but there there's and and how many of us have we we've done wrong in our life we've uh you may you know you you've been face to face with what you should do and you didn't do it but there's got to be a reconciliation for that now the reconciliation for the jews is the two two prophets begin to preach and they begin to preach a word that opens up their eyes and they begin to wreck be reconciled and they're full of the holy ghost and it brings them back to harmony with god they recognize what god did for them now brother brahman the sixth full purpose of gabriel's visit to daniel he said to make reconciliation for iniquity iniquity is doing wrong as it did as it did they did at the cross they didn't they they put him on the crowd they put the word on the cross and that that's that's a good definition of iniquity they said he said he made reconciliations but it will not be applied to them it was not applied to them why because they were blinded and could not see it and why did they blind well maybe today because i'm blind you're willfully blind they were blind because of god blinded them but you're blind because you're willfully blind there's no reconciliation for you if you believe not that i am he said jesus you'll die in your sins that's right so reconciliation means to to bring back to to bring back in harmony with god to to join things to to to to to reconcile a relationship it's talking about relationship god wants us to have a relationship with it with himself now if we go to the next slide in colossians chapter 1 verses 19 to 22 it says for it please the father that in him should all fullness do well and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works your mind wasn't thinking right yet now have you reconciled he's reconciled you because now you're thinking right and you're doing right and you know what the message is for and you know what your purpose is for and he's but he's put that life in you the same life that god had aided abraham in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight brother brown said you come god's way through reconciliation by the blood and then become a son or daughter and daughter of god then all things are possible then miracles are possible then a revival is possible you believe that this morning then because the price the way back has been it's like it's been it's heaven and earth has come together and you can get back now you can get back to what adam and eve lost a way has been made so now we've got we've got so many great promises and if we go to the next slide we've got confidence that for in that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to sucker them that are tempted so he came down to be like us to go through the same things and now he's able now sucker means assistance and support in times of hardship and distress and brother brown said sucker means to sympathize in other words god is able to help us out because he knows what we've gone through now i was i was kind of just meditating on this the other night and you know there's a lot of things that people go through that i i can't really sympathize with because you know i can't sympathize with with knee problems because i haven't really had knee pro i've had problems but not knee problems specifically there's a lot of different problems that i can't sympathize with but if you've gone through it if you've gone through somebody's problem if you've got migraines then you can sympathize with somebody that's got migraines now if you've gone through life like like let's talk about jesus he went through the problems he would like the bible says that he the son of man hath not where uh where to lay his head like foxes or bird the birds have nests and the foxes have dens but the son of man i have not where to lay his head he was a homeless person so he went through he went through knowing a lot of griefs and troubles and things now what that means is that when you go through troubles and trials you can you can have confidence that he's not looking at you like a just a uh like some like you know how a lot of people believe that god is it it doesn't want to get involved in your affairs that he's just kind of uncaring but we we believe in a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities so what that means is brother brown said he had to become flesh to feel the pain of sickness to feel the temptation of lust to feel the temptation of want to feel the temptation of hunger to feel the power of death so that means young people that god knows what you're going through that means old people god knows what you're going through and you can have confidence when you come in prayer to ask anything of him that he's he's sympathizing with you he's not looking at you just like like at uncare he's not uncaring but he cares about you and and brother ram went on to say that he might take it upon himself to stand in the presence of the great spirit jehovah the spirit not the man the spirit to make intercession to this life you know what intercession means it means to do something about it it means to to get intercession means is is is like uh if if a bus is going to go off cliff let's use it and now forgive me just for a second but let's use a like a comic book analogy superman would jump in front of of a bus that's going off a cliff and get in the way of it now christ interceded for us he he got in the way of us going off the cliff and he he did that for us that's what intercede means that when you're when you've got a problem in your life he he gets involved he's not just a standoff god that that doesn't want to help right and the bible says and brother ram said and jesus took that in order to make intercession for us for he knows how it feels when you get sick he knows how you feel when you're tempted he knows how you feel now the next slide brother ram said he went on to say did you ever notice when we vote for a president every farmer will vote for a president that's been a farmer or he knows the hard part of the farmer's life so somebody a people a farmer wants somebody to represent them in politics that knows what they're going through so that we they can go to bat for them so that they understand the struggles of a farmer so we've we've got somebody that knows what we're going through so he can go to bat for us he can fight our battles for us he knows how to do it see he said he wants some man who understands and before god could ever understand him being that great holiness how could he ever understand after he condemned man by his holiness he condemned man and the only way he will ever know how to justify man is to become man so that's a lot of things packed into the first two chapters of hebrews let's summarize in the last few minutes we got now the book of hebrews was written to the hebrew church and in hebrews 10 we find out that it's written to some people that has suffered a lot of things so paul is really trying to encourage them and and it was written to separate law from grace and why why does law need to be separated from grace to show you that you're not saved by all the things that you do or by trying to be good but you're saved by the grace of god that he's given to you that you just believe on him and then he will transform your life not because you were good to begin with but because you believed on a god that's good and he changed you and so the goals of hebrews are are to elevate jesus to to bring to our mind that jesus is the one that wrote the old testament he's the one he's the author he's the one that wrote about all these promises he's the one that fulfilled the things that were we were just talking about the high priest and the sacrifices and all the all the uh the implements there in the in the tabernacle and it's to challenge the reader to remain faithful despite all the persecution now if we go as we go through the book of hebrews it's divided into four sections now chapters one and two compare jesus with the angels in the bible so as compared is saying he's the one that wrote all these things and he fulfills these things now chapters three and four compare jesus with moses and the promised land so when we start getting into chapter 3 paul begins to say look at all the things as they were coming out of egypt they didn't go into the promised land because they failed to believe and he begins to compare christ with all those things that they the all the promises that were laying there and before them and in five and seven is comparing jesus with the priest and melchizedek who is this melchizedek that paul gets into to show that the life of christ the life that was in christ is that same life that talked to abraham and in chapters eight and ten come to compare jesus with the sacrifices and the covenant and all of those things and and when you get into chapter 11 he lays out all these great models of faith that we can compare look at look at how all these abraham and moses and and sarah and all the different ones they there they were a model to us to look at to see these conquered and overcame by faith now look at what you can do by faith as they overcame by faith what about you and knowing that despite all the hardship and all the persecutions and musicians can go ahead and come forward and we'll close the despite that despite hardship and persecution god will not abandon his people amen so the whole book of hebrews is encouraging i believe in an encouraging gospel we've got something that should build our faith up god bless you [Applause] you
