[35:59] hey man and we're gonna start reading
[36:01] that verse nine
[36:07] if you haven't say man
[36:10] the bible says and moreover because the
[36:13] preacher was wise he still taught the
[36:17] people knowledge yea
[36:19] he gave good heed
[36:21] and sought out and set in order many
[36:25] proverbs the preachers sought to find
[36:28] out acceptable words
[36:31] and that which was written was upright
[36:34] even words of truth
[36:36] the words of the wise as
[36:39] the words of the wise are as
[36:42] golds and as nails
[36:45] fastened by the master of assemblies
[36:48] which
[36:50] are given from one shepherd
[36:52] and further by these my son
[36:55] be admonished of making many books
[36:59] there is no end and many study
[37:03] is
[37:04] a weariness
[37:05] i mean much study is a weariness of the
[37:08] flesh
[37:10] verse 13
[37:12] let us
[37:13] hear the conclusion of the whole matter
[37:17] fear god
[37:18] and keep his commandments
[37:20] for this is the whole duty of man
[37:24] for god shall bring every work into
[37:28] judgment
[37:29] which
[37:30] every secret with every secret thing
[37:33] whether it be good
[37:36] or whether it be evil
[37:39] amen lord bless reading of his word you
[37:41] can have your seats
[37:45] you know i want to use for a subject
[37:47] today
[37:48] uh just as a statement
[37:52] now what
[37:54] now what
[37:56] you know church um
[37:58] if if if we're talking to the young
[38:00] people or even if we're talking to
[38:03] just people in general you know as
[38:05] believers if you ask the question
[38:08] now what
[38:09] if you think about life and what you're
[38:11] trying to achieve
[38:13] and after you achieve it
[38:16] then what
[38:17] then what you gonna do
[38:19] you know if you say well i'm gonna serve
[38:22] god you know after i get married after
[38:24] you get married now what
[38:26] you say i'ma serve god after i get my
[38:28] house after you get the house now what
[38:31] you say i'ma serve god after that give
[38:33] me a good job god gives you the job now
[38:36] what
[38:37] the conclusion of the whole matter
[38:40] is to fear god
[38:42] and serve him amen well not just to come
[38:45] to church play ties and play instruments
[38:48] no fear god with a reverence that you
[38:51] will give your life yes so i say you
[38:54] know now what you say brothers why you
[38:56] come up with that particular thought now
[38:58] what because i want to show you
[39:01] uh the life of solomon now we know that
[39:04] according to the scripture
[39:05] solomon was one of the most wisest men
[39:08] that ever walked the face of the earth
[39:10] you know uh uh he god basically he went
[39:14] to god he asked god for wisdom to lead
[39:17] his people amen
[39:19] i hope young people i hope you read in
[39:20] your bibles
[39:22] he asked for wisdom to lead his people
[39:24] and god said because you asked for
[39:27] wisdom i'mma give you everything that
[39:29] your heart desires
[39:31] you know because the scripture says seek
[39:33] ye first the kingdom
[39:35] and then everything else that you need
[39:39] will follow you
[39:41] so god will answer you now what if
[39:44] you're seeking the kingdom
[39:46] so church we don't want to young people
[39:48] we don't want to just let our own goals
[39:50] or our own aspirations or desires get in
[39:53] the way of what god has for us you know
[39:56] i've been there you know i wanted to be
[39:58] as a young man i wanted to be a
[40:00] professional football player and would
[40:02] have made it if god's will wasn't in the
[40:04] way
[40:08] hallelujah did y'all hear how i put that
[40:10] hallelujah god honest faith
[40:13] and you know i had faith enough to
[40:15] believe in myself and was on my way had
[40:18] trophies after trophies but then god
[40:20] said that's not what i got for you
[40:23] so god directed my path put me exactly
[40:26] where i needed to be and allowed me to
[40:29] have cancer in my brain
[40:32] just to keep me in a proper place
[40:35] you know i'll tell her by the way that
[40:37] even when things happen that i can't
[40:39] explain i never say the devil did this
[40:43] all right
[40:44] the devil did that or the devil didn't
[40:46] no
[40:47] i don't do that because then i put the
[40:49] devil in control of my life i always say
[40:52] god what are you doing i'm looking for
[40:54] an answer from god if we are god's
[40:56] children if you are god's tripping
[40:59] children the footsteps of the righteous
[41:01] are ordered by god
[41:04] so anything you go through if you're
[41:06] asking now what you have to say god did
[41:08] this
[41:10] and people may look at your trial of
[41:12] what you're going through and don't
[41:14] understand it but do not confess the
[41:16] devil is doing this
[41:18] even pharaoh was under god's control
[41:26] church now for those of y'all who know
[41:28] me ain't nothing change

[41:54] but if you look at solomon
[41:56] solomon had
[41:58] great wisdom
[42:00] but before we get into his life i want
[42:03] you to understand the wisdom solomon had
[42:07] was the wisdom of god

[1:04:18] church look after this last time to do
[1:04:22] what time it is
[1:04:26] okay okay all right
[1:04:27] last time this this doctor this fresh
[1:04:30] meat
[1:04:31] he a fresh meat he didn't know what he
[1:04:33] was getting into
[1:04:34] he's gonna challenge everything he's
[1:04:36] been taught
[1:04:37] holly come on we got it he said well
[1:04:40] miss d we can't find it everything good
[1:04:41] i'm standing there like yeah i know
[1:04:43] with a smile i wouldn't be an arrogant

[1:04:58] he put
[1:04:59] 20 32.
[1:05:02] [Applause]
[1:05:07] so if i got to go through a trial it
[1:05:09] won't be in two years
[1:05:12] hallelujah
[1:05:14] the rapture might take the place before
[1:05:15] i had to go through this again
[1:05:17] hallelujah so i say to you young people
[1:05:20] when you believe in god god will take
[1:05:22] care of the now what yes sir
[1:05:25] i called my brother cause he was a truck
[1:05:27] driver too hey bro check this out i just
[1:05:29] got a d.o.t exam and the man gave me 10
[1:05:32] years we laugh and laugh at last
[1:05:37] but god is in control
[1:05:40] young people god is in control if you're
[1:05:42] going through something right now it's
[1:05:44] because god wants to strengthen you
[1:05:50] let me get out of here church
[1:05:52] i'm not a long-winded preacher i believe
[1:05:53] in hitting the point
[1:05:55] getting to it and moving out of the way
[1:05:57] because you necessarily got to preach 45
[1:05:59] minutes
[1:06:01] when you catch it that's good enough oh
[1:06:03] look remember the woman at the well
[1:06:05] jesus probably spoke down 15 minutes
[1:06:08] dealt with us talking to a little bit
[1:06:10] look at the conversation he's talking to
[1:06:11] a little bit she going back like a
[1:06:13] version he probably said he was
[1:06:14] contacting the spirit hallelujah once he
[1:06:17] got that he dealt with her sin he shined
[1:06:19] the light on the problem hallelujah hey
[1:06:21] man you have five of us and the one you
[1:06:23] got in charge and jesus was saying here
[1:06:25] i am
[1:06:26] let me complete you here i am hallelujah
[1:06:29] next thing you know she running down
[1:06:31] there come see a man who told me all
[1:06:33] things
[1:06:35] so don't get in your head i got to read
[1:06:37] 20 quotes and and and go back and forth
[1:06:40] up and down the bible now
[1:06:42] will you believe operating your faith
[1:06:59] i can't understand why we don't have a
[1:07:00] hallelujah running through the church
[1:07:04] hallelujah is the highest praise
[1:07:06] if you want something from god it's two
[1:07:08] words you got to have in your vocabulary
[1:07:10] in church
[1:07:11] just two words
[1:07:12] hallelujah you ain't got to be able to
[1:07:14] break the seals down all you know it's
[1:07:16] two words that get god's attention one
[1:07:18] is hallelujah
[1:07:19] and the one that really makes him back
[1:07:21] up is amen
[1:07:23] [Music]
[1:07:25] [Applause]
[1:07:35] [Applause]
[1:07:40] did you just hear them say so be it
[1:07:42] devil get out the way
[1:07:46] when you say amen make god stand up
[1:07:49] cause you know he's sitting on the
[1:07:50] throne
[1:07:51] but when you say amen he get up
[1:07:53] you said that
[1:07:55] hallelujah
[1:07:56] all hannah wright said was that ain't
[1:07:59] nothing but the truth god said give him
[1:08:00] whatever she asked for right now
[1:08:04] [Applause]
[1:08:06] and y'all sitting in here and don't want
[1:08:09] god to move
[1:08:11] amen we'll make him move
[1:08:14] here
[1:08:18] it's it's just crazy to me people come
[1:08:20] to church they know the word the word
[1:08:22] has been preaching it down
[1:08:31] for 45 minutes
[1:08:48] amen because the word is true
[1:08:50] [Applause]
[1:08:54] hallelujah
[1:08:56] hallelujah
[1:08:58] even if it's somebody else's testimony i
[1:09:01] will still say amen
[1:09:03] cause i believe he can do the same thing
[1:09:05] for me
[1:09:10] hallelujah
[1:09:12] oh my god
[1:09:14] let me get out of here
[1:09:17] church back to solomon something you
[1:09:21] know i got testimonies for days
[1:09:25] that was saying don't like me
[1:09:27] each other people you know you'd be
[1:09:28] doing me going to god just like you know
[1:09:30] in the bible you got to find the
[1:09:32] parallel of your life
[1:09:35] remember remember the the woman in
[1:09:36] memphis tennessee she said eyes just
[1:09:38] like that shooting
[1:09:40] and since i'm just like that shoot i'm
[1:09:41] like where's my light
[1:09:43] since she found her place in the
[1:09:45] scripture but you know what everybody
[1:09:47] want to be in abraham or or a paw hunter
[1:09:50] they won't they want demonstration in it
[1:09:52] like i want to be a peter or something
[1:09:54] like no i realize i'm joke
[1:10:00] i'm joke i'll be going through things
[1:10:02] that there's no explanation
[1:10:06] the only explanation is god is saying to
[1:10:08] the devil watch it ain't gonna quit
[1:10:13] his friends go forsake him but he ain't
[1:10:15] gonna quit hallelujah hey man they're
[1:10:18] gonna talk about his family but he ain't
[1:10:19] gonna quit hallelujah he's gonna look
[1:10:22] like he's calling in anointing no more
[1:10:24] but he gonna quit
[1:10:28] god is saying i got somebody on the
[1:10:31] earth who still will believe through
[1:10:33] everything
[1:10:37] that's right
[1:10:38] and maybe some of you girls are sarah
[1:10:41] hallelujah when it looks like you're not
[1:10:43] able to bring forth life god said it at
[1:10:46] a point in time it's going to come
[1:10:48] forward
[1:10:49] maybe some of you young girls are ruth
[1:10:52] when they're just standing around
[1:10:53] nothing but death god will lead you to
[1:10:55] your boy ass
[1:10:58] [Applause]
[1:11:00] maybe some of you young girls all right
[1:11:01] esther hallelujah when all the rest of
[1:11:04] them are getting tatted up getting
[1:11:06] earrings and nails and all these other
[1:11:08] things done after saying i come as i am
[1:11:11] because i'm the queen
[1:11:14] i've been chosen out in the queen
[1:11:17] i've come to replace somebody
[1:11:22] i'm the replacement
[1:11:38] see i keep coming over here because
[1:11:39] these three girls right here
[1:11:40] they pull it
[1:11:42] y'all might not see it but they pulling
[1:11:44] holly on the inside is something
[1:11:46] connecting hallelujah
[1:11:48] don't get it twisted everybody gotta be
[1:11:50] ah
[1:11:51] no
[1:11:52] sometimes just there
[1:11:57] y'all don't see what i see
[1:12:00] i got to be careful
[1:12:01] you might do that
[1:12:06] the bible says welling and gnashing your
[1:12:08] teeth hallelujah we're going to
[1:12:10] spiritually grab only god
[1:12:14] church look brother
[1:12:16] everything solomon did was through
[1:12:18] wisdom
[1:12:19] but let's look at it we're going to hit
[1:12:22] this thought now what are we going to
[1:12:23] get out of the way hallelujah
[1:12:25] look
[1:12:26] the bible says
[1:12:28] back in ecclesiastes the first chapter i
[1:12:29] don't know if y'all putting that up
[1:12:30] there but if you can it will be a
[1:12:32] blessing
[1:12:33] because i like to show the people that
[1:12:35] what i'm saying
[1:12:37] is not brother dee's thoughts
[1:12:41] what i'm saying
[1:12:43] is two places i'm pulling from
[1:12:45] i'm pulling from the scripture
[1:12:48] or i'm pulling from the prophet's
[1:12:49] message
[1:12:50] and the prophet's message if you really
[1:12:52] understand it's the scripture
[1:12:56] they are one entity they're not two yeah
[1:12:58] that's right
[1:13:01] hallelujah
[1:13:11] god clearly said this is not bro this is
[1:13:13] not william branham
[1:13:16] just like every other prophet said paul
[1:13:18] was saying it's not high but it's the
[1:13:20] law follow me as i follow christ
[1:13:25] isaiah said hallelujah who will you sin
[1:13:28] lord he say lord send me
[1:13:30] hallelujah god told moses i've heard the
[1:13:32] cry of my people and now moses i've come
[1:13:35] down what was god in moses
[1:13:38] it's not two different entities it's one
[1:13:41] when god comes on the scene
[1:13:44] hallelujah that's why we don't look at
[1:13:46] ourselves as us and god no it's one
[1:13:49] entity
[1:13:51] he said i am my people are one
[1:13:54] hallelujah
[1:13:59] but i feel the holy ghost moving up in
[1:14:01] here
