everybody ready for the word well let's go right into we're going to turn and read from john chapter 14 verses 1 to 8 this morning um and i i told the brothers in the back i i don't have like a list of quotes or anything but i'm just gonna read some really kind of read off of the sermon things that are to be and um if they're able to follow along then that would be great um but i'll just i'll just read some quotes and and just kind of do a little teaching sermon this morning let's go to the lord in prayer before we look into the word we thank you god for your presence this morning lord thank you for the songs and the psalms that were read lord jesus we thank you god for all that you've given to us lord jesus and we lord we thank you god for working things in continuity lord the things that we're saying and the songs and the thoughts that have already been said lord jesus or write in continuity with the message this morning lord lord god there might be trouble all around lord jesus but god you've given us a comfort lord in this hour that we can look to your word and look to you lord jesus for something that passes all understanding lord god we may lord we can open up the bible with our physical strength lord but now we ask lord that you'll open up our understanding that we're able to look into the word and and perceive lord jesus what you would have us to know in this hour little god and we pray lord that you'll feel welcome to move among us lord this morning lord jesus said that this just won't just be like a a formal service lord but but hearts will be united to you lord god and you can feel a liberty to move among us lord jesus we thank you lord god for your grace and this hour and our lord lord jesus and i pray god that you'll give us grace to have understanding now we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ so i'm going to take a the title for this this sermon is in my father's house and uh and and again i'm i'm i'm preaching off of the sermon things that are to be and so i say that because you know uh really you know as brother branham got closer and closer to the end of the of his ministry seems like the things that he said began to get stranger and stranger and almost almost some of the things like in this message that you will you may be reading some of the quotes that almost stumbles a lot of people and i really want to get you to encourage to go back into the message and find out do you really understand the message because there's some very perplexing things that little statements that brother branham says like in this sermon in the sermon after this modern events made made clear by prophecy brother adam begins to explain how you say you've got the baptism of the holy ghost but that's not really that's there's something more than that right you say you've got the baptism there's the quotes that where brother brown said that you could have the baptism in the holy ghost every day of your life and die and go to hell what does that mean that's a very perplexing thing what do those kind of statements mean and so i want to dive into those and this morning and if you if you begin to wonder what are the is are there things that are brother bob saying are they really are they really true go back into this message and study it out and find out just really meditate on the quotes the things that are to be so let's read in john chapter 14 verses 1 to 8 and just to kind of set the stage now think now this is the this is the things that jesus said to his disciples just before he died now brother branham preached this sermon and less than 20 days later he died now said that as the context and this sermon things that are to be and jesus said let now your heart be troubled that's a good that's a good statement in this hour you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also and whether i go you know and the way you know thomas saith unto him lord we know not wither thou goest and how can we know the way jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but my me if you know me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now that little scripture i love the book of john but because this he's got that eagle ministry and he really says some things that that really i believe apply to the bride now now that things maybe that people have probed at for the ages but now we can really begin to understand and and it's just the things that jesus just said are maybe compared to the things that are in the prophet's message because they're they're very they're very strange strangely worded and truly you must have a revelation of jesus christ to be able to understand the things that are spoken it cannot be understood just by you know a lot of times you want the minister to explain explain it to me just like lay it out for me but it really god has to speak to you to open up these things that are worded in such a way that it's hidden from the wise and the proven it's hidden from the people that are real careful i don't know if i want to get mixed up in that but if you'll do like the bereans and get into the scripture and really study things out it will it will begin to change your life it will actually change you and you'll begin to understand now now it says there in verse 3 that he he left them he was going to leave them to prepare a place so that they could be together and if i go and prepare a place for you jesus said i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also now the bible says in hebrews 13 5 it says let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee now that's one of the first little paradoxes and the things that i want to talk about this morning is that jesus is saying he's going to leave them but the bible says he will never leave you he said i'll never leave you so he's leaving he's leaving to prepare a place and where he went and died on the cross and and went through all the acts of of leaving them so that he could come back and be seated on the father stone in your heart and in in your heart to begin to prepare a place to begin to quicken something within you to begin to build something within you you see so so we want to we want to this morning we want to look past the things of the flesh and the things that we can see and look into this realm of the unseen and hear from the voice from another world and begin to look at something past past the things that we can see with our mortal eye you know the first verse in this in the scripture that i just read letting not your heart be troubled jesus says tell it to think about how many times jesus told him don't fear that the angels would say don't fear let you let not your heart be troubled and and amidst all of the christian journey it looks like there's a lot of trouble you know if you look at like david's life how he was hunted by saul and how he was betrayed by his own son there's a lot of trouble going on look at joseph thrown in a pit and thrown in prison you think now if what if you were to stop that trouble what if you were to restrict grab joseph out of that pit then his life the the purpose for his life would never been able to be manifest what if david had never been hunted by saul and go gone through all those things that were a type of christ then the purpose of his life would never be made manifest what if job the story of job he lost his possessions everything that he had he lost his children he lost everything except his wife there and even his wife began to to say why don't you just curse god and die it looked like he just lost everything but yet all of that trouble that he went through was there for a purpose and a lot of times we begin to think as a christian as our christian journey that it's supposed to be a life without trouble but god brings you through trouble to manifest himself to get you out of the way to build character in your life to show forth his attributes in your life my wife and i were sitting there talking the other night about nabeth in his vineyard if you think about that story of naboth how the the king came and took away his possessions and robbed him of what god had given him and got men to lie about him and told lies and pearl neighborhoods they're dying in the street and everybody's telling lies about him but yet he had a purpose in his life to manifest god had not forgot about him you see a few a few weeks or months or however long later and ahab and jezebel are lying in the street with the dogs eating their bloods because god had not forget forgotten about him and you think because you're going through troubles in life or because you got sick or because you're laying in your bed of pain or something's going to happen and on in you that god has forgotten about you but god has the bible says that he'll never leave you or forsake you [Music] so jesus jesus is leaving the disciples and he tells them don't don't let your heart be troubled now in your flesh in your spirit excuse me in your flesh in your spirit you might be troubled but let not your heart be troubled and and the reason your heart is not troubled the reason a christian's heart is not troubled is because jesus has given his peace to you and what is his peace his peace is his word now listen jesus is saying believe me let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in other words he said listen listen to what i'm telling you if you listen to what i'm telling you my words will give you peace my words will give you a comfort that passes all understanding you might be true you might be dealing with kidney stones you might be dealing with kids that have gone away from the message you might be dealing with a migraine or frailty and sickness but down in your heart you know you because you've got that peace that passes all understanding that god is on your side he's saying listen to what i'm saying you believe in god believe also in me and you know that can be said for any ministry that's preaching the gospel you believe in god and believe also in me believe what i'm telling you to be the truth if i say the same thing that the prophet said if i say the same thing that jesus said it's still the truth it might be coming from a dumb donkey it might be coming from a man veiled behind flesh but it's still the truth and that same truth will give you peace in this hour letting all your heart be troubled and jesus said brother abraham said he said look if it was so easy for those jews who had been taught through generations to believe that there was a great supernatural god but to think that god had come down and was manifesting himself through the person of his son jesus christ god and tabernacled in a body of flesh that was a little too much for them to understand now let me just get your mind aligned with what the thought of this message is is to not look so much at the outward flesh not look so much of the things that are going on that are troubling in your fl in your flesh and troubling you in the world but look down see the problem that they have was they were they were unable to look beyond the flesh and see the god that was hiding behind the flesh the problem that we have is is where it's so difficult to look past the veil of flesh down on the inside that's the most important thing that's what brother and said the real gift of god is your soul the real gift of god is not this thing that you're tabernacled with not this body of flesh but the body of the the word body on the inside of you that god wants to give you see jesus jesus he said jesus therefore is telling his disciples that this life is not ended in death he said i go and prepare a place shows that there he was speaking to them that there was a life after this life has ended that this life is not all there is there's there's something greater than the things that you can see there's something greater than all the pleasures of this world the lust of the flesh and the pride of life there's something greater than anything young people that cigarettes and tobacco and alcohol and all this stuff could give you there's something greater than that and it's failed it can be veiled behind your flesh if you let god come in and take take his abode in your heart and brother as you get older now there's so many of these quotes that stand out in this message now just listen listen to this one he said as you get older that becomes more of a reality to you as you begin to see the days of your life drawing close then it begins to you begin to pack up closer getting ready for that great event it's a continuing of the same life in another world another place now as we go through this as we go through kind of studying this message i want you to kind of think now that it's important to understand the context that brother branham was preaching this message because a lot of the things that he'll say about how you got another body and you're going to he's he's talking about he's talking about death because he is going to die and he's setting in the mind of the people he's like look my body my body he said in paragraph 23 of this sermon he said this is a funeral message and now maybe this is my opinion but i believe he was preaching his own funeral that he was preaching that when you see my body laying in the grave that that's not me there's something that's there's something that more real than that body that's laying in the grave decaying there's something more real there's a real there's i have a real body somewhere that you don't see laying in that casket or laying in that grave something real and so don't don't get confused when you begin to meditate on the things that he's saying he's talking about he's talking about in one sense that your body would be changed but in another sense when you die if you were to die then this body would be laying there in the casket and that's not the real you you've got a real body something on the inside that you go to and he said he said and last night speaking over in yuma for the pre-christian business man i spoke on the subject of the rapture now there might have been a strange subject to speak among a banquet but most everyone there was christians and that's the way it is on these campaigns like this or in church i can say now how many of you as christians probably every hand would go up you're a christian and if so and so if we're christians now here's here's the point if we're christians the title of this sermon that i'm preaching from is things that are to be if we're christians i think we ought to be kindly notified ahead we don't have to just kind of guess at it we notified what our destination will be when you think about what what the grace god has given us to give us a message well we don't have to guess what's beyond the curtain of time we don't have to guess what what it will be we don't have to guess what the future home will be the whole plan of redemption has been laid out in front of us so that we can have full understanding we can have understanding from the book of genesis and before back in the back part of god's mind all the way to new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven all the way to the uh the word unfolding continuously down through the endless ages we can have an understanding of all these things and that's why the message was given to you so you could have an understanding of what is going on now and where you're going that this is not all there is to it this is not the end of it and you see that is what gives you peace brothers and sisters that is what gives you a peace that passes all understanding let you let your heart not let not your heart be troubled because god has given his word to you that brings you peace in john chapter 14 verse 25 to 30 if you keep reading on down in that chapter he says peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid and see the world wants to give you all kinds of peace that will give you just a peace that maybe for a moment maybe for a moment you get a high when you're on drugs or something but after you get off the drugs then you go down into a pit of despondency and despair and you just begin to cycle until you're getting up for work and you feel like what am i doing here and you get home and you get drunk on alcohol or whatever and you go to bed and sleep and you get up and do it all over again but that's not what god wants you to do he wants to give the word put the word inside of your heart to give you a peace that the world cannot give listen listen friends don't satisfy for a peace that the world tries to give you that the devil because there is no peace that the devil can give to you the only true peace is that kind of peace that jesus had when he was on that boat in the storm the kind of peace that passeth all understanding the peace of his word he said if you can believe me you will have peace in your heart if you can just believe me you believed in god beliefs i believe also in me believe in me because i'm telling you the words of life i'm preaching to you the words the words of eternal life and you see his mess this message tells us this message the bible tells us that there is nothing out of cater but abraham said in this message he said god knew you would be here he said your birth he was pre-planned the infinite god know to be infinite he had to know every flea that ever would be in the earth and how many times it would bat his eye that's infinite the infinite god he knowed all things therefore there's nothing out of cater he knew that you would be here he knew that you would be going through whatever trouble you're going through he knew whatever situation you're in tonight he knew if you were seeking the baptism in the holy ghost he know he knew in advance everything about you you know that's one of the things about this message and things that are to be that he's trying to get you to understand that he knew what's going on in your life he knew you he had it all planned out so when you came here everything would be situated so that you could you could manifest the word of god he said so you say how do i know where i'm at brother brown said if we know the word of god we know where we are living if we know the word of god we know where we're living we know where we're living because we can look in the bible and see that that there was supposed to be a seventh church age messenger in malachi 4 there was supposed to be a messenger come just before the world is burnt with ashes and we're living in that time we can see all these scriptures that we can identify ourselves with and know the day and the hour that we're living in brother brown said we know the hour that we're living in he said we know what lays ahead we see what we've passed think of think about that the word gives you knowledge of what has passed and you can see where you're going brother ram said his word spoken must come to pass you know one time the bible says that isaiah and isaiah 7 14 therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel and and for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government should be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace and you see that word spoken had to come to pass that word spoken had to be made manifest you see because jesus jesus's birth his life was prepared god knew before the foundation of the world brother brown said he was he was the bible says he was crucified before the foundation of the world all of his life was prepared he was prepared and so you are prepared now let's talk about how he was prepared the bible says that he would be born of a woman that he would be born in bethlehem that he would be born of a virgin the bible says that he would come from the lineage of abraham that he would be a descendant of isaac he would be a descendant of jacob and he would come from the tribe of judah the bible says that he would be heir to king david's throne that he will be his throne will be an anointed and eternal it would be called he would be called emmanuel the bible said that he would spend a little time in egypt and he's a and a massacre of children would occur at his birthplace the bible says that a messenger would prepare the way for the messiah and that he would be rejected by his own people and many many other prophecies the bible his way was prepared by the word that's spoken by the prophets and the prophets spoken and spoken and spoken until finally it was manifested and that little baby he had that manger prepared he had the place the little cavery was born he had all of that prepared so that he could come into being and be man manifest and the same thing applies to you he knew that you would be coming and he had it prepared for you brother brown said just like your birth here you was prepared he said even things that your parents done from generation to generation your heavenly body is prepared your earthly body is prepared you see that i i i i hope i'm not getting too deep for you this morning but look look now brother brown said he quoted this scripture in hebrews chapter 7 as i may say so levi also he receiveth tithes paid tithes in abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchizedek met him see coming down coming down god is preparing he brother brown said in the serpent's seed he never said he'd done it in the shadow he potentially done it the bible said he paid tithes then if we come through the right seed when paul preached the gospel i was there and you were there right we're going to get into that in just a minute plum up to our ears you were prepared the whole plan and purpose of your coming now you think now now a lot of times we'll kind of get we'll let me let me see if i can slow down to address this properly i don't want to get so fast that you kind of lose lose what track of what i'm saying now levi paid tithes in abraham he was not born yet but yet he paid tithes in him now now think spiritual genealogy speaking that you are identified you're part of something you're part of something greater than just your own little life you're part of a body and if you're part of a body you're part of the word body the body of christ so when he walked on the shore of galilee you were there because you're part of him and when paul preached the gospel paul being a part of that body you were there you were you were part of that and that word line coming down from paul irenaeus martin columbus luther wesley branham and you heard one day you heard the gospel preached and that light quickened in your life the word quick and quicken in your life and and you're because you're part of something because you were god knew that you would be manifested one day in this earth and so he had it planned for you to hear the word he had a plan for it to come down like that like abraham isaac jacob levi he had a plan for all all the different ones to preach the gospel and hear it until finally it gets to you it gets to you and it's pre-planned for you to be manifested he said you were all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance with god he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight your natural body was planned your spiritual body was playing it was all planned out so that you could come into manifestation my if that that should get what kind of peace that should give the believer that god thought of you there he foreknew you before you even came into the earth and your mother and father were playing by god your all the way back was playing by god he knew so that you he planned it all out so that you could come into manifestation he said the brother brown said the only way that you can be a son a daughter of god because you have to have eternal life there to be a son you of god you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there was even a molecule see and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as a son of god that gene of life was always in god that gene of life always was eternal and that gene of life now manifested in you makes you a part of something levi was a part of something levi was a part of something that's why he says he paid tithes in the loins of abraham because he was part of something you're identified as part of something brother you know brother brandon said if you're an american you're identified with america even all the all the bad things and all the good things you're part of it and you're part of something you're part of this body now now let's slow down for a second i i know i i know sometimes when i preach i give a lot of information so let's let's slow down and digest this a little bit is everybody okay i don't want to i don't want to firehose you you know or you can't hardly drink in first corinthians chapter 12. let's just meditate on first corinthians chapter 12 verses 12 to 14 paul says for as the body is one and half many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is now you're part of something and how many bodies are you part of you're part of one body there's one body by one spirit you're baptized into one body for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles or whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many now now brother i believe that's that's the scripture confirming that maybe a paradoxical statement that brother brahms would say that god is not one like your finger there's one body but yet with many members for the body is not one member but many so god can manifest himself in a many-membered body but we're all part of that one body now if the body is the word the word this word body that we're all part of is this one theophany of god so we're all part of one theophany and we have our own word body if you're part of that body then you're you have you have your word body and you're part of this one word body this one word body that has many members and you see you see this is why when somebody gets sick we begin to feel for that other person that's what brotherly kindness is maybe you yeah maybe you don't like the blusteriness of somebody or you don't like some you know just maybe you don't have that much to talk about maybe somebody that doesn't like to hunt doesn't have much to talk about with somebody that hunts but yet you're all part of that one body and so when somebody gets sick you begin to feel for that person because you're all one body we're all part of one thing we're one identity and we're all moving together toward glory you see you see if if your toenail gets like zoey she she broke her toenail off the other day and we began to talk about how if your toenail if your toenail gets hurt you don't say oh well you're not you're not my eye you're not oh well you're just a little toenail you begin to get concerned about that little toenail you begin to get concerned about the the more uncomfortably parts of your body you see and you see that you think you think well i i i you think you're you just don't matter much but yeah you're part of the body and every part of the body has a place and a part and a purpose to fulfill you see you see the purpose of understanding that that gene of life that was in god before the foundation of the world there's a purpose to that and see when that life becomes manifested in a tabernacle of flesh then now that purpose is being made manifested god has a purpose for you and it's not just to fulfill your own lust to the flesh but it's to fulfill that that that plan that god had for you before the foundation of the world galatians four chapter four verses four to six it says but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father because you are sons now now now thinking along this that before the foundation of the world god knew you when did you become a son now we know you had to receive it down here on earth we know you there had to come a time when you opened up the door of your heart and received the receive that eternal life but god knew before the foundation of the world that you would receive it and so it says because you are sons because your son he knew that you would receive it he knew that he you would open the door to receive it and so he had it predestinated for you wherever you are brother braham said wherever you are god knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you've got eternal life then it always was eternal life and god before there was a foundation world knew that you would be here and when the word or the water the washing of the water of the word fell upon you it was expressed in a being now these i i don't believe that god put these things into the bible or sent this message to us to just bore us and to to cause us to slumber but he sent these words to us to give us peace in our heart in a time of trouble so that we don't begin to look at the things around us so that we don't begin to look even at our own mistakes and frailties but to look at god's word to keep our eye on his word and you know if if god has his way if god put his word in you then your purpose is to be a light to the world he plants you in a church to be a light to the world he plants you at your work to be a light to the world and that is your purpose to shine a light on the other so that others may see that light and come to the light and their eyes will be opened so that they don't see the darkness brother adam said now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age your purpose is to light up the sage he said you are in you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express god to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate my goodness to think that that is your that is your purpose is to be a light to others and and we would be dare said to cover over that light and say well i don't want to sing in the church i don't want to sing i don't i don't want to come and sing a special when god has given you a gift to do that my i don't want to lead songs or whatever because i don't like doing it i don't want to preach the gospel because god has given you a gift and a purpose in this life and it's not up to us to cover over that light to put a bushel over that thing like jesus said neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house god has given you a gift god has given you a measure of himself to be to be a witness to people to be a help to people to be an encouragement to people and that's why he said let your life so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven because why we're identified and cr we have an identity with him we're identified with god now he said now then if it was jesus was the fullness of god manifested he was the fullness of the godhead bodily therefore when he came to the earth and was manifested in flesh you were here in him then because he was the word you were here and then because of that scripture we just read that you're part of that body you're part of that body you're part of that of the word and brother baby said therefore you walked with him yes when you were in him when he was on earth you suffered with him and you died with him you was buried with him and now you are risen with him and manifested attributes of god setting into heavenly places already raised resurrected to new life and setting in heavenly places in christ jesus now now i think you see that scripture that we read when i began to preach open the sermon that in my father's house are many mansions now that begins to mean something a little bit more that now in my father's house in my father in this body word there are many members in my father's kingdom there are many mansions in my father's theophany there are many word bodies that make up this one word body you see i hope we're not getting too deep here but listen this message is deep god gave us a message that we're supposed to get out and swim and not just baby around and just kind of preach a little altar calling something but this message is something that will bring us to a higher calling if you'll get into it get into the word let it not bore you but let go rise from your sleep and your slumber and get into the word the spirit reveals that you are part of him you're part of that word body john chapter 14 verse 18 20 it says i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you little get a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you in other words he's put his life in you and that makes you part of the body that makes you part of him he is in you and you are in him you see why did brother breton preach this message at the end of his ministry just before he went off the scene so that your heart would not be troubled that he is going off the scene because something is the bride is about to catch a revelation of what this message really is just because he's leaving don't let your heart be troubled but something is going to happen jesus when he preached this scripture he said letting not your heart be troubled to his disciples as he was about to go off the scene just because jesus is going off the scene it's making a way for something greater for for the outpouring of the holy ghost now now if you are part of the word if you are part of this word body if you are part of christ then what do you live by if you're part of the word then you live by the word isn't that true the word bride must live by the word and brother brian said now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride what is that he's going to tell you what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride yes not a creed or denomination but a living oracle of god do you know what an oracle is an oracle is where you go to hear directly from god so the bride now is the oracle of god if you want to know what god's will is then you come to where the voice is you come to the bride and you see let's not get stumbled over in that we know that brother branham was the voice to this age but if you catch the revelation of what that voice said then now you are an oracle of the living god that you can come to a member of that body and receive directly from god doesn't the scripture say that ye are gods if you have ye are gods who the word came to they are gods who the word come to and if the word comes to you and you have a living revelation of the word of god a present tense revelation of the word of god for your age and he was saying the same thing that the prophet said you become a living oracle of god now now brother bob that's a little bit too deep but yeah your prophet said that i'm not saying it i'm just reading you the quote now now see that's where that's where we come to to to maybe a turning point are you willing to lay down your own creeds and your own ideas and accept what the prophet said this is not my thought this is not my idea but he said the bride would be the manifestation of this hour that's what he said he said the bride not a creed or a denomination no the bride will not be a manifestation of the baptist church or the methodist church but he said god had to come with a message himself and she will be the living oracle of that message she will be a living oracle of god an oracle is someone that is able to communicate with the deity able to communicate with god and he said a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living in now now martin luther could not express the attributes that we express martin luther was expressing the attributes for his day because that was in the beginning brother brown said the resurrection like the corn of wheat that went into the earth he said he said now listen he said i don't believe that a person just happened to be here by chance because the reason he's saying that is because you your purpose is to make manifest the word for your day not the not the word for another day but the word for the present tense word for this day excuse me and brother brian said now listen he said you grew from your birth when you was born and presented into the world god knew that you were going to be here in this earth and you growed from birth to maturity things that seem so strange to you in your young womanhood young boyhood as children now seems very real you couldn't understand it when you was a child but now as you become adult you begin to understand and find out that everything will sit just right you it really means something to you now you see how your natural birth parallels your spiritual birth when you're a little baby you couldn't understand things but as you grow up in in just your natural life then you begin to understand how how to pay taxes and how to buy a home and you begin to understand things that you couldn't understand as a baby and the same thing in your spiritual birth as you grow as you as you grow into your adulthood you can look back on that time when you were at the altar and the time that you didn't understand what the message was about and as the word began to he put word upon word and now it begins to make more sense you look back and all those things that you probed at that didn't make sense at first but now they do because the pieces are beginning to come together and brother branham said so is it in your spiritual birth you do things that you don't understand when you're a little baby you come to the altar you give your life to christ you you do such strange things strange things you wonder why you did it but after a while when you mature as mature christians then you understand it see then you understand it he said how it fitted to you in this life as you grew everything fitted right in because you were made for that right wasn't it a strange thing the night that you staggered into the mission the tent meeting of the little church somewhere on the corner that's something the preacher preached on a certain subject and you just fell right at the altar see god knew that before the foundation of the world it seems strange to you why you did it then but now you understand you knew what happened it's so fitting to you in this life and will be also in the life that is to come this world and its life seems to advance as you mature everything seems to go right with you and you see as you in your spiritual birth you begin to realize that that you were not made for this world the carnal world i'm speaking of the the thing the the all the carnality and all this but you were made for a higher purpose we're not believing just in a myth or a fantasy brother brandon said heaven is a place just as real as this is where we don't sit up there for eternity and just sit there on a cloud we don't just strum our heart for all for all all from here ever but we're going to a real place where we're going to do things where we're going to live now things that ought to be let's set our let's set our mind on things that ought to be for a second and think about where we're going he said we're going to work now in our natural life we work but in this place that we're going this spiritual place that we're being birthed into we're going to work we're going to enjoy in other words he's saying we're not just going to sit around strumming on a heart for all eternity but see you have a purpose you're not just going to sit around up there like watching dandelions grow maybe i i would like to do that for maybe a thousand years when we get over there and just kind of watch and observe but you have a purpose you're not going to just spend all of your time they're just sitting around we're we're going to work we're going to enjoy we're going to live we're going to life to a real eternal life we're going to a heaven a paradise just like adam and eve worked and lived and eat and enjoyed and the garden of eden before sin came in we're on our road right back there again right back and so then that trivializes it makes nothing all the troubles and things that we're going through doesn't it you have all these aches and pains in your body i think louise was talking about how that you start getting these aches and pains and and that's certainly that's true as i get older you know we were talking about i need to make an appointment to go to the doctor again and and how would i even start it's like the older you get the longer the list gets well what's wrong with you let me get off the list and just start playing the banjo because the list is so long but you see all these troubles and things uh let not your heart be troubled you believe god and god believe also in me but you believe the word and the word is what gives you peace that this is not all there is to it the things that you see all these troubles and things we're going through life to build character we're going through life to build to build to so that we can you know like one thing that troubles do is it really solidifies your relationship with god when you come out of trouble then it's like you know god more than you knew him before you went into the trouble when you go through some trouble you begin to rely on him more and you begin to get serious with god and you being getting a call out to him and things and when you come out the other side you said i thought i loved him before but now i know that i love him and now i know that he loves me and you see your troubles are working something in you and and it's been squeezing out something it's squeezing out the manifestation of god from the inside working out it's producing something in you like grapes being squeezed it squeezes out something good letting all your heart be troubled jesus said you believe in god also believe in me in my father's house or many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i'd go to prepare a place for you now things that ought to be this sermon things that ought to be is about is about your mansion your mansion and let's just i hope you all aren't getting tired on me you know a lot of times when brother branham if you listen to brother brown he doesn't preach real excited or anything and it's easy to have it in the background and just kind of like maybe doze a little bit but my goodness there's so many nuggets and things in the message even though he's not preaching maybe animated or whatever but yeah it's eternal life laying it laying on that tape so so let these words give you peace that in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you and brother branham said when he began to preach on this in this sermon he said now now i'm not trying to change the word to give him anything don't be stumbled over by the way that he approaches this but he says in my father's house is many kinds of mansions many kinds and i i think this would give you peace this will give you peace that you think a lot of times in in the in crit in your christian walk you begin to think that you're supposed to be like somebody else now see we don't pattern ourselves after somebody else we pattern ourselves after the word and so that's an important thing to realize that in the in my father's house are many kinds of mansions many kinds of mansion now a mansion is a the the greek word is is the way i remember is mon it sounds like money monet the greek word monet is where you abode your abode a mansion is your abode where you live in so there's many kinds of mansions and brother branham said now he said i don't believe that when we get to heaven that we will be just everybody looked just exactly alike if all the mansions were exactly alike then everybody you wouldn't be able to tell anybody apart but there's differences there's blond people there's brown people there's black people there's different kind of color people different kind of hair different kind of eye color and different kinds of attitudes and thank god that he make that god loves variety so that we can all manifest a different part of the word different different expressing different parts of the word and that's the way god wanted it that's the way did you know brother brown even said that when you came into the world that he put mountains for you and streams and that's why some people like to go up to pigeon forge for vacation and some people like to go hunting and some people like to go to the beach because god said brother brahma said that god made that for you that he knew the kind of person you would be and so when you were born here he made those things for you to make you happy like my wife gets out of the backyard and she my wife loves birds and and and she's kind of it's kind of rubbed off on me a little bit i start you know we can identify birds and things because god made those birds for my wife and you too if you love birds he made the birds so that when you go outside they sing to you and those kind of things now think about how gracious and loving god is that he knew you so well that he knew that when you got here that you would like the mountains or the oceans or the birds or the rivers or whatever and he said i'm gonna put this right here i'm going to put this hunting spot for brother wade i'm going to put this beach for for sister monica i'm going to put this over this mountain up here that bro i know brother bob likes to go go up and just sit in the mountains sometimes and go on hiking trails and things i'm going to make this for him and he made those things for you think about the love of god and and and he knew he's doing the same thing for your future home when you get over there he's got it all situated just the way that you he knows that you will like it my mind to think about to think about the grace of god that he knows you better than you know yourself he when you get over there you're going to be surprised at the things that you like wow i didn't know that i was going to like like everything situated like this with a little creek in my backyard or whatever it's going to be but you see he's building he made you he made your personality just to fit you he made everything about you he made your body to fit you brother said i don't believe that when we get to heaven that we will be just everybody look just alike i don't believe that that all will be blondes or brunettes or little or all big or all giants i believe that god is a god of variety he's got big mountains and little mountains he's got planes he's got deserts he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it and he made the season summer winter spring autumn he made the seasons it shows he's a god of variety he made you in a rut now think about that maybe the young people sitting here tonight old i don't like the way that i look but god made you that way he put he gave you the personality all the things about you he made you that way he produced you that way to manifest his attributes he made you in a variety he said some men are real blusterous and some men are real now think about that a lot of times you think well i don't know if a real blusterous man has got the holy ghost i don't know i don't know if i like that person but god makes people in a variety and some one man might be real blusterous and he said and some are real dogmatic how many how many preachers have you have you heard uh i i i'm not gonna call his name but i remember the preacher that led my parents to the message boy he he he was real dogmatic he told my mama he said you got an evil spirit on you because you got them pants on and he laid it out there through not didn't not caring about feelings or anything a lot of times we think well we should care about about fear we don't want to hurt no feelings but he they came to the message and he laid the word right out there and told them the truth some are real dogmatic and see sometimes you need somebody that's real dogmatic sometimes you need somebody that's real blusterous somebody sometimes you need somebody that's a little softer because god is a god of variety and he put all those gifts into the body because we're part of one body that's all working together and he said and others are fine others are kind think about that some are blusterous some are dogmatic others are fine others are kind and you just find all different kinds of people in his kingdom now brother brown said look at saint peter and judging by andrew no he can't do that now andrew was a prayer warrior and he spent all his time in prayer and he said he said he just stayed on his knees all the time and the apostle peter was one of those firebrands that preached and paul was more scholarly like more of the like the prophet or something and set back now i i believe that's one thing that people in the message need to understand is that it's good to have a fiery preacher like peter but every once in a while you need a some good teaching like paul come on and lay the word down and then then like like paul said i i planted an apollos is watered let the word be planted and then let a real firebrand come through and water that on top of it you need you need everything in the body see we get so balanced sometimes because we wanted things just a particular way we uh you know there's churches in the message that they like they're preaching like peter and there's churches in the message that they like they're preaching like paul and different people they like want somebody like andrew we need all these different gifts we need them that's why we need a five-fold ministry we need the whole because listen you may be able to profit more by by my preaching sometimes you may be able to preach from brother prophet from brother wage or brother dales or brother louise's a different time different part times in your journey but you see it's god has given us all different gifts different ways of manifesting a variety so that you may be able to profit and we need it all right now notice many many mansions many kinds of mansions the father knew that you would be here and prepared everything before for you before you got here your first coming your first coming here he had it ready for you when he got when you got here and so he he said when you see a man here when you see a man here struggling to live somebody in a hospital or on a sick bed or in an accident struggling and the death rattle is in their throat and pulling and crying and screaming for life what does that mean there's a place somewhere there's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that see it just doesn't fit you see that is what gives us peace to know that when you see somebody struggling in the hospital on a ventilator or whatever and you see somebody get in an accident or whatever they got their body might be all tore up broke legs and things or maybe not just sitting in church dealing with kidney stones and troubles in their life but yet there's something your body is pulling and crying and screaming for something else it's thirsting for for a land beyond the river there's a place somewhere there's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that amen now y'all doing okay the clock's circling around see see i want to get to some of these things because there's there's some deep things in this message that are kind of can be a little bit confusing brother branham in this semester is things that are to be now go back and read this message and study it and meditate on it i want to encourage you he's talking about bodies and it seems a little bit con you know we we believe that this body will be redeemed but he begins to talk maybe in a confusing way that this body is gonna this body is gonna be come to an end and this body is gonna uh he's talking about the body going into the grave and you go to another body it sounds like and that begins to you pray for a revelation of what he's talking about because he's speaking of in my father's house there are many mansions and you're mentioning as an abode and we talked about how that you are in one body you're part of one body part of one word theophany body but yet there's something something down on the inside that's the real you this is not your real body your real body is on the inside so let's go to second corinthians chapter 5 verses 1 to 4. and paul says for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved if this if this body were dissolved we have a building of god and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens in other words you got a mansion we have a building of god not a body that was produced by a product of sexual desire of carnality of sin but you have a building that god made and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven in other words earnestly desiring for all of this to to be consumed by that house that's on the inside to become to be clothed on so that we don't have to deal with this anymore so that we don't have to deal with this trouble we don't have to deal with all the temptations of life and all these things we're groaning to be clothed upon if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life you see that's what we're groaning for that we're in this tabernacle in this body of carnality and we're groaning within ourselves do you realize that's why you come to church because you're groaning for this to be swallowed up of life you're something inside of you is groaning because you're part of the word and because you're part of the word you feast on the word you desire the word and that's why you desire to come to church that's why it's such a groaning thing to be quarantined at home and to be away from people because there's something on the inside that's groaning for life for the for all of this to be swallowed up brother brown said we are now in christ jesus babes in christ children of god waiting for the full deliverance at the coming of our lord jesus to receive us up unto himself when the body this mortal will take on immortality now he says and now when this body this body is dropped here in this earth like the baby is dropped also there is an immortal body waiting to receive the spirit back into itself again now think about how my so many deep things to really meditate on when this body is dropped here in this earth when you come into the earth then you're this that little soul enters into that body and when this drops you have somewhere to go there's a body there that you step into or step see to frame that right that's very difficult to walk that tight line there's a body on the inside of you that god is building a mansion of god a theophany word body and when this body drops so you just right go right into that brother said just as the body gives you here just as this body he gave you to live in only expresses that there is one that is greater yet to come a body that yet to come that you cannot seed now you cannot see but it's one day it will be revealed now see see god is looking at your future he's looking he's already in your future he's already looking at the things that are to be he knows where you're going to see now i've got the problem of trying to wind up here i'm running out i honestly i could preach for another two hours i know i know that puts a little bit of panic in some people's hearts but all right i'm going to find it i'm going to find a place to close up here so i i don't want to keep you i know how it is and he said he already sees you there nothing can separate you from his love not all these trials and all these tribulations nothing that nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus now let me read another scripture here and i'll see if i can and wind it down in first corinthians chapter 15 verses 35 to 38. paul's talking about how some man will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come and he says i wonder how how we would react if a minister would have talked to us like this that fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die and that which thou sow us thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain in other words he's saying if you if you go out and you try to plant a wheat plant the body of the plant in the ground that doesn't even make any sense you plant the seed and then from that seed comes forth the body you plant the seed in the ground and the body comes up but god and and that which thou sow was not that thou sow is not that body that shall be but bear grain it may chance of wheat or some other grain but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body so the seed is what produces the body the seed of a plant will produce the wheat plant of a wheat plant will produce the wheat the seed the acorn will produce an oak tree and if you plant the seed the word of god in your heart it will produce a word body on the inside god giveth it a body as it has pleased him and to every seed his own body now now your carnal natural body was produced by that seed the wrong seed hybrid seed but the word body the inc it was produced by an incorruptible seed let's go on to read there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star different from another star in glory so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption because you come from adam and eve's transgression you were sown you came from your mama and daddy and it is raised in incorruption now what could be more incorruptible than the pure gospel preached what could be more incorruptible then let's put it like this the end time message that you were so your natural body is sown in corruption but this body on the inside is sown by you receiving the word for your day and the word for your day is actually what produces this mansion it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it's sown in weakness and tribulation and trouble and all the things that david and joseph and all those all the things that we go through in life but it is raised in power what kind of power the gospel power a gospel life the light of this end time message listen there is power in this word to transform you and make you act different than the way that the world acts that's the kind of power that bring that is brought by the incorruptible seed word of god and he says in verse 44 it has sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body because the word seed is what produces a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and in verse 49 he says as we have borne the image of the earthy in this natural body that's right we shall also bear the image of the heavenly right y'all doing all right for a few more minutes i hear a lot of amens and i see a lot of sleepy eyes brother we don't have an afternoon service so i'll just go for a little bit longer [Music] now now brother rem see see see we're going from an earthly tabernacle from an earthly body and listen if all this is a little bit too much or whatever i encourage you again go back and listen to things that are to be things that ought to be is such a profound wonderful message and just go just put that tape on and listen to it he says this one this body this earthly carnal tabernacle has lust and sickness and death but we're going he said oh but the other one the other one is called my father's house he's gone to prepare a place a perfect place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists no death exists it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection and you have to be perfect to get there and that's what stumbles a lot of people i've heard so many young people and different ones that how can i be perfect i can never come to perfection in this life because you're looking at it as though you've got to you you got to in your own by your own actions and things you've got to come to this place of where you don't you don't never trip and fall and you don't you don't never you know do anything or you don't everything any kind of bad thought about somebody you see he's your perfection your righteousness is a product of what god did for you on the cross he died for you on the cross so that he's not looking at you even anymore he's looking at what he did and so you're covered over by the shed blood we were talking about you remember brother brown used to talk about pat tyler the uh he used to be the old mobster and live the life of sin and i i'm pretty sure he even killed people when he was in the mob mob and everything and my brother told me one time he said that pat tyler would polish his hand with baby oil until he could hide a pair of dice in his hand and he would he would come up to you and toss out two pair of dice that were red and he would say once my sins were scarlet and he would take those dice back into his hand where he had polished him into a hall of his hand and they would throw out another pair they had hidden in there that were white and he said but now they are white as snow and you think about what god can do to a old mobster like that that turn somebody and just transform their life around because because that's the a product of the shed blood of jesus christ that when the blood is the pride applied to your life he he transforms you and changes you and that is what makes you perfect how could how could a murderer or somebody somebody that's lived a life of sin how could you be made perfect all the things that we've done if we go back in all of our lives and look at all the transgressions but it's what he has done not what we have done he's the one that's covered us over by his blood and he's the one that he's looking at that blood atonement he's not even looking at you all he can hear is your voice crying back to him father forgive me father forgive those that wrong me here's your voice and he's not even looking at the things that that you've done you were we were talking about um how you know the bible says righteous lot but look at all the the nonsense that rod pulled throwing his own daughters out there and said they never lived with any man and and look at abraham that righteous abraham whose righteous his faith was counted for righteousness but yet he tried to give his wife away to the king twice and all these things and you see because god is looking he's looking at your faith and what he has already done don't get don't get tripped up on what you've done if you've done something wrong if you've made a mistake then just ask god to forgive you and trust that he's looking at what he you look at what he's done because that's what that's what he's looking at and brother brahma said they see there's the father's house that he's going to prepare this one come by sex and from the fall and must fall with the fall no matter how much you patch the old thing up she's going to fall anyhow she's done because she's doomed because god said so she is finished god is going to destroy it he said so there'll be a renovation of the whole thing you believe that now that sounds like he's saying that god is going to destroy this flesh and that's where all these doctrines come about we're going to walk out on the ashes of our own our body and all these kind of things let's see in this message if you just pay attention just read a little bit further he flips to talking about that to talking about the future home about how your soul was cleansed by the holy ghost and fire how you went from a process of justification sanctification to baptism in the holy ghost and the holy oaston fire burned out all the uncleanness in your heart and transformed it and now you're going through you're going through a higher form of that justification it's a statue of a perfect man baptism of the holy ghost and fire the true token in your life and that holy ghost and fire cleanses you out cleanses your spirit out and then then you go through it again to cleanse your body out to transform your body not to give you a new body but to take that body and transform it by the holy ghost and fire you see he's saying this body's got to be demolished was your soul demolished was this earth demolished will this earth be demolished when the fire comes and cleanses it off it'll be a new heaven and a new earth but it'll be because it's been cleansed by the holy ghost and fire just the way that your soul is cleansed just the way that your body would be cleansed by the holy ghost and fire coming in and cleaning it off and he said oh my god he's talking about see there's a birth taking place to birth us into that other world to birth us into a place and and if you're hungry your father will feed you he gave us his word so that he could be with us and he said therefore if you've tonight tonight just come say i offer jesus christ my life let's go ahead and close on this i i've kept you for a little bit a while so i'm gonna go ahead and close on this he said the musicians can go ahead and come he said therefore if you tonight just come say i offered jesus christ my life and you never receive the holy ghost come into it you must do it you must grow into it ask god to pile word on top of word like that until you become the full stature of a son of god or a daughter of god the full stature he gave us his word so that he could be with us and my there's so many other wonderful things i i i i fear i fear today that there are many people that are sitting in message churches that don't get in to find those little nuggets that are in these messages if you would sit down and just pay attention to the things that brother branham is saying listen to this message and modern events made it clear by prophecy and you'll have an understanding of what he's what the baptism of the holy ghost does that you grow you grow into the word that the word is actually being birthed into you as you receive the word that as you feed you are becoming the word and that is what gives you a home to live in when you go to the other side if you don't open the door of your heart and receive that word then you don't have a mansion to go to um when this body is it dissolves and goes away and so that's what that's why we come to church that's what we listen to the tapes it's but god is he he said i go i go to prepare a place for you and he didn't go somewhere off far he didn't go on the other side of the galaxy or some some moon way off way out on another planet but he he went so that he could come and tabernacle himself and you so that when you bring the word to him he quickens it and brings it to life he's gone to prepare a place for us but not gone he's here amen let's let's stand to our feet and just praise the lord and worship him amen
