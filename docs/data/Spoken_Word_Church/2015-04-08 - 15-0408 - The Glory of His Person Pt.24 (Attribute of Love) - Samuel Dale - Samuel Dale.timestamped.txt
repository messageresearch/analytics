[3:03] remember little Adam and his ey this as
[3:06] we pray father we come to you with a
[3:11] heart of love and understanding for
[3:12] little children Lord and we just ask you
[3:16] that you'd reach down and touch little
[3:17] Adam there Lord take away that problem
[3:20] in his
[3:22] eye we believe you and we thank you we
[3:25] just ask you to manifest yourself in the
[3:28] way to whatever it would be thank you
[3:30] for being with each and every one of us
[3:32] we know that we pray for each one here
[3:35] Lord for the sickness Among Us of the
[3:37] physical needs of our bodies and we know
[3:39] that that we're all wearing out and
[3:42] getting older but we know also every day
[3:45] we're getting closer to thy return so we
[3:48] ask you to just help us and guide each
[3:51] and every one of us be with us tonight
[3:53] as we speak you said you sent your word
[3:56] and healed us and delivered us from
[3:58] destruction you've been with many who
[4:00] were away and have been Lord to
[4:03] different places and coming back home
[4:05] they're here tonight others will be
[4:07] coming in the rest of the week so we ask
[4:09] you to just bless each one and give a
[4:12] safe journey and keep us all Lord in
[4:14] your grace in Jesus name
[4:19] amen John I mean excuse me
[4:22] Revelations
[4:26] 1 and I turned to see the voice that
[4:29] spake with with me and being turned I
[4:30] saw seven golden candlesticks and in the
[4:33] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[4:36] unto the son of man clothe with a
[4:38] garment down to the foot and Girt about
[4:41] the paps with a golden girdle all right
[4:44] let's go to John this is a very familiar
[4:47] scripture with us but our thought will
[4:48] be taken on this point John 3:16 for God
[4:53] so Lov the world that he gave his only
[4:55] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[4:58] him should not perish but have
[5:00] everlasting life for God sent not his
[5:03] son into the world to condemn the world
[5:06] but that the world through him might be
[5:09] saved you may be seated the Lord add his
[5:12] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[5:17] I want to make sure and clear up
[5:19] something to because you may have
[5:20] misunderstood me in what I was saying
[5:23] Sunday I believe I said it correctly but
[5:27] I don't want you to misunderstand me uh
[5:29] there's two comings of the Lord in the
[5:32] Bible the first coming and the second
[5:34] coming but now in the bride part there
[5:38] is actually three parts and I think I
[5:41] said that to making it to where that he
[5:44] come one time to redeem his bride he
[5:46] comes the second time you know to get
[5:49] his bride and he comes the third time
[5:52] with his bride in the millennial Reign
[5:55] you know coming back to be with him and
[5:58] that way then and it would be uh to
[6:01] Israel you only dealing with basically
[6:04] two comings because you know he come
[6:07] back to redeemed now he's going to come
[6:09] and meet them in the Millennium so that
[6:12] would be the basis and I I was hoping
[6:14] you understanding that and I believe I
[6:16] said it but I thought well I'll just
[6:19] have to make sure uh because the prophet
[6:22] would say everything would travel in
[6:23] threes the voice of the sign say first
[6:26] coming of Christ to redeem the bride
[6:28] second coming of Christ to receive his
[6:30] bride third coming of Christ with his
[6:33] bride to rule in the millennial Reign
[6:35] all right so then I was trying to bring
[6:37] that mainly that point to you to uh make
[6:41] sure you know I didn't want you to
[6:42] misunderstand me and say well I I heard
[6:45] him say there's three comings well there
[6:47] there's only two comings it's just the
[6:51] the Life part is a
[6:53] two-part doings because he comes once he
[6:57] comes there to you know pick up his
[7:00] bride and take her in the Rapture all
[7:03] right and then he would come then to
[7:06] deal with Israel and their doings but
[7:11] then he would come with the bride into
[7:13] the millennial Reign so I wanted to make
[7:15] sure and not let that go as something
[7:18] that you'd say well I've heard him say
[7:20] three comments but see there's really
[7:23] only two comings first coming Second
[7:26] Coming the second coming is just in two
[7:29] parts to the bride because it is a part
[7:32] that he becomes so visible Among
[7:36] Us right and he said in the bride coming
[7:39] of Christ coming out of the church he
[7:41] becomes so visible Among Us he'll raise
[7:43] the dead and go into Rapture but that's
[7:45] still not
[7:46] Corporal all right so we meet him in the
[7:49] air and then Corporal body though will
[7:52] come in the millennial rain and we will
[7:54] come with him in Corporal bodies like
[7:57] unto his all right make sure
[8:00] that you know that I don't leave you
[8:02] dangling I know that I spend a lot of
[8:05] time uh saying a lot of things trying to
[8:08] get you to a point of thinking about it
[8:11] but I don't want you to misunderstand me
[8:13] all right then what you believe is is
[8:15] left up to you uh you know it's not uh
[8:19] not to me to reveal cuz I can't all
[8:22] right but I want to make sure now too uh
[8:25] I've thought over all of this week long
[8:28] about what I was trying to bring on the
[8:31] services Sunday and and I don't want you
[8:35] to
[8:36] misunderstand uh you know something that
[8:39] would hinder you in a a way of of
[8:43] following on later into the message and
[8:47] uh you know in doing that uh I hope you
[8:51] understand the point that we've tried to
[8:54] bring uh do you understand if you don't
[8:58] just raise your hand and ask a question
[8:59] about do you understand the
[9:03] anointing how that you can actually be
[9:07] Anointed with the genuine baptism of the
[9:11] Holy Spirit and still be lost now do you
[9:15] understand that's that's what brother
[9:16] brandham said that's that's not me when
[9:19] none of us was smart enough to even say
[9:21] any of those things but you know to to
[9:24] just to make sure that you you
[9:27] understand those those points and and
[9:30] get it lined up because you know we see
[9:34] we we have been so uh dwelling on the uh
[9:37] Pentecostal people do on the anointing
[9:40] until you know it gets into a point that
[9:44] the prophet had to make a lot of
[9:46] emphasis about it and he believed in the
[9:48] anointing he he was the one that taught
[9:50] us about the anointing he he believed in
[9:53] those things and he expressed it and all
[9:56] like that but then his point was
[10:00] what the anointing can't save
[10:05] you it takes the person of Jesus Christ
[10:09] to come and live in you in the New Birth
[10:12] amen all right see then that anointing
[10:15] throughout the Old Testament as they
[10:18] were back there that anointing would
[10:20] anoint the people and great things would
[10:22] take
[10:23] place but you know it didn't save any of
[10:26] them now it it did in the point that it
[10:30] made a form of salvation but what we
[10:33] mean by when we emphasized it and the
[10:36] prophet would say you would be could do
[10:38] that and be lost he's he's trying to
[10:41] emphasize the point of where you're
[10:44] anointed at and remember in the Old
[10:47] Testament as it says in the scripture
[10:49] there that you know uh the Holy Ghost
[10:52] had not been given because Jesus had not
[10:55] been
[10:55] glorified we see there was no way for
[10:58] those Old Testament Saints to come to
[11:01] that position Adam and Eve started off
[11:04] wonderful with eternal life in their
[11:06] soul but everybody after then no matter
[11:11] if it was Abel or Seth or who you know
[11:14] coming on down after then they would
[11:17] come into the Satan's domain and they
[11:20] would not have eternal life and they'd
[11:23] be no way to get that eternal life into
[11:25] them because it would take the death
[11:31] of the Lord Jesus Christ the releasing
[11:34] of the soul of almighty God to where
[11:38] that it could come back in the form the
[11:40] prophet said of the baptism of the Holy
[11:43] Ghost on the day of
[11:45] Pentecost all right now does everybody
[11:48] follow that you're you're you know
[11:50] because that will would help us to
[11:53] understand that you got the difference
[11:55] in the dispensations of the Old
[11:57] Testament and the dispens pensation of
[11:59] the new all right now a lot of people
[12:02] say I don't believe in dispensation well
[12:03] the Bible says calls it dispensations
[12:07] all right and brother brandom certainly
[12:09] believed in
[12:10] dispensation all right so then we're
[12:12] we're going to stay with that and
[12:14] believe it I don't care who the the big
[12:17] name people would be I heard a man say
[12:19] one time I don't believe in
[12:21] dispensations well I didn't ask him what
[12:24] he meant but I just took what he meant
[12:27] as being that he didn't believe in
[12:28] dispensation
[12:29] you know I mean that was the best way I
[12:31] could understand it and uh I thought
[12:34] well surely he's read a little bit you
[12:37] know he's heard a little bit even
[12:39] reading in the Bible it talks about the
[12:41] dispensation all right and see as a
[12:44] Baptist we understood the
[12:46] dispensations you know I mean you know
[12:49] we taught those things back in the
[12:51] Baptist Church and all of the the
[12:54] dispensation of the Old Testament and
[12:56] dispensation of the new and see then
[12:58] that dispensation of the Old Testament
[13:00] they could not be anywhere there that
[13:03] the life of Jesus Christ could come back
[13:06] that's why you had the animal
[13:08] atonement all right now when Jesus
[13:11] Christ
[13:13] came now come on when he came died
[13:17] released his life made a way it ended
[13:20] the killing of the animals
[13:23] right see there wouldn't have been any
[13:25] killing of the
[13:27] animals see had it been that they could
[13:30] had eternal life without the death you
[13:33] know I mean with the way they were going
[13:36] they couldn't even be protected it
[13:38] couldn't be covered they couldn't they
[13:40] didn't even have a sacrifice without
[13:42] that lamb in the Old Testament but they
[13:45] was no soul in that lamb so all that
[13:47] could do it could anoint him and they
[13:48] done great
[13:49] things I was listening today to where
[13:52] brother randam was talking about in the
[13:53] Hebrew Book that they back
[13:57] there you know shter suer and this that
[14:00] and the other and he said it'll be a
[14:02] shame for us one of these days when we
[14:03] stand before those
[14:07] people so you think about it they
[14:09] without it brother who what did he say
[14:12] he said
[14:13] uh get it right which one wasn't job was
[14:18] it Daniel one of them where brother B
[14:20] said there he he kept the victory
[14:22] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[14:25] all right and that would see that that
[14:28] go to show so I hope you understand that
[14:31] part because it makes it to where we can
[14:33] follow it and we can we can follow then
[14:37] the point of where sin entered the
[14:41] picture through the point of the spirit
[14:45] real and not through the
[14:48] soul all right but it made once when
[14:51] mankind now that was with Adam and Eve
[14:53] see when the sin happened it was in
[14:55] their Spirit realm all right see then
[14:59] when it would come in the New Testament
[15:02] it could enter into that phase again to
[15:05] seal away the soul away from Satan but
[15:09] until that time would be it would have
[15:10] to remain as to that he could anoint and
[15:14] that's what I I spent one message the
[15:17] morning service explaining the
[15:20] anointing that would be upon your spirit
[15:23] real you know and and that would do
[15:26] great things that I said but it did
[15:29] didn't save anybody back
[15:31] there it didn't take away the desire of
[15:35] David to sin that's right even though he
[15:38] would cry out in his and and he'd say
[15:41] about his soul you know he he longing
[15:44] for God to restore unto him the
[15:47] salvation and the thing but it couldn't
[15:50] get into him enough to be able to change
[15:53] his nature and his
[15:55] ways right even though he could be
[15:57] anointed to all those things and great
[16:00] things would take place but it could not
[16:03] bring them into the kingdom and that's
[16:04] where I was bringing it down to where
[16:06] that we think about see like uh John the
[16:08] Baptist where the Bible said and the
[16:11] prophet emphasizes it that he received
[16:13] the Holy Ghost in his mother's
[16:16] wound well we believe
[16:18] that but the Bible says the least in the
[16:21] kingdom is greater than John well all
[16:24] right now that scripture is telling you
[16:26] something was wrong there
[16:30] that he could be anointed and to be all
[16:32] of those things and could have the
[16:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost from the
[16:36] mother's womb but we'd fail to go on and
[16:39] read the others where it says Elizabeth
[16:41] was filled with the Holy
[16:44] Ghost we see and that puts us in a
[16:47] position then to to where we've got to
[16:50] think over some things and and get them
[16:53] laid in the line to where we can
[16:55] understand and the prophet said you
[16:57] remember if you don't see in every verse
[17:00] he said go back and read it again he
[17:01] said because you missed it but he didn't
[17:03] say if you didn't see Jesus because that
[17:05] wouldn't work because he wasn't back
[17:08] there that way all right and that
[17:11] brought that down to where our
[17:13] understanding would be then of the
[17:16] anointing now this is very valuable for
[17:19] probably Sunday
[17:21] afternoon that the anointing would come
[17:24] upon their spirit and great things would
[17:28] take place
[17:30] but it would still not put them in the
[17:33] kingdom it still wouldn't give them the
[17:35] new birth because Jesus Christ had not
[17:38] died to release that life all right it
[17:41] would take then the Soul of almighty
[17:44] God to be taken from from Christ to be
[17:48] able to come back on you and I you know
[17:50] upon the people to give eternal life but
[17:53] does everybody follow that where he said
[17:55] like on
[17:56] leadership and I I brought these in case
[17:58] we needed them where brother Brown talks
[18:00] about on leadership and he says many of
[18:04] you think I got the baptism of the Holy
[18:06] Ghost I'm going to heaven he said that
[18:08] don't mean one thing that you're going
[18:11] to
[18:13] heaven well brother Dale I thought all I
[18:16] needed was the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[18:20] that's
[18:21] true we do need it we've got to have it
[18:25] but you can have the baptism where on
[18:28] your
[18:29] Spirit see now if he hadn't said those
[18:32] other things that went with it look
[18:34] where you and I would have been and in
[18:37] the old days we didn't have the ability
[18:39] to uh search out to find other things
[18:44] and I well remember in the days when we
[18:47] come into the message long in there in
[18:48] the and you know in ' 67 that that was a
[18:52] big topic back then and there was very
[18:55] few people that you know would even
[18:58] discuss it because they they didn't
[19:01] understand it right then as the time
[19:04] went on and we begin to get more tapes
[19:07] and doing things then it began to come
[19:10] out you know I'm like brother Mo was he
[19:14] said that that they heard a take from
[19:15] Brother brandham one day that that Adam
[19:18] and Eve walked out of the garden and
[19:19] said look like there's
[19:21] lost well until brother brandham said
[19:24] something again they had a
[19:26] problem he said then we got a tape where
[19:29] run around and said yeah but how God put
[19:32] the atonement for him well see that's
[19:35] that's where we were all were back there
[19:38] in the understanding so he says you can
[19:41] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[19:43] hour in your life and still be lost and
[19:47] go to hell the Bible says
[19:50] so that's taken from leadership then he
[19:53] goes on thinking man's filter he says
[19:56] you see that anointing upon the spirit
[19:59] not upon the
[20:02] soul but now you know where the
[20:04] anointing is falling at and then he goes
[20:07] on to and north at not and says they can
[20:10] absolutely have the real spirit of
[20:14] God anointed on that Spirit but still be
[20:19] lost in just as devil possessed as they
[20:21] can be with that
[20:24] Spirit now that's strong isn't it that's
[20:27] right he said that's why you can't tell
[20:29] that woman that it's wrong for her to
[20:32] cut her high and wear pants and the
[20:34] things like that he said because they're
[20:37] anointed well that's what I've said here
[20:40] in the end time you
[20:42] know you can't tell people today because
[20:45] they're
[20:47] anointed you know so they're not going
[20:50] to listen but look what he says about it
[20:52] you know and I remember I think I gave
[20:53] this in Sunday but he says on the
[20:55] Rapture talking about uh not false Jesus
[20:58] is
[20:59] now false Christ anointed ones falsely
[21:06] anointed to the
[21:10] word falsely anointed to the
[21:13] word cuz that's the only way you'll know
[21:15] whether a person's anointed one or
[21:19] not and see then you
[21:22] know as far as what it
[21:25] is I hope we're not Baptist you know we
[21:28] good old Baptist I don't throw anything
[21:31] stones with just what we talked about
[21:33] the way we done you know we talked about
[21:36] that the Holy Ghost come on the day of
[21:38] Pentecost I know I got
[21:42] it I got it because it come on day of
[21:45] Pentecost well now that's that's a lot
[21:48] isn't it that would mean everybody got
[21:51] it well and I'm not you know I'm not
[21:54] throwing stones but I'm telling you that
[21:56] was the truth
[21:58] we got it because it come on the day of
[22:00] Pentecost well is that the way it is now
[22:03] we got it because brother brandom had
[22:07] it I mean is that the way we go with it
[22:10] are we are we going with that see but to
[22:13] be falsely anointed to the word cuz
[22:16] there's nothing wrong with the
[22:18] anointed that's why he calls it the
[22:20] anointed ones at the end time I remember
[22:23] and I'm sure that some of the others
[22:25] sitting here can remember when they used
[22:27] to talk about false anointed
[22:29] ones that was the way everybody done it
[22:32] back in the 60s that it was talk about
[22:34] false anointed
[22:36] ones well then we found out brother Rand
[22:39] said the anointing was not
[22:42] false the person was false
[22:46] right he said balam cus
[22:51] prophesied it was balum that was falsely
[22:54] anointed to the word there was nothing
[22:57] wrong with the anointing
[23:00] it told the truth balam wrote
[23:03] scripture Kus prophesied that Jesus Must
[23:06] Die under that
[23:09] anointing all right but see then it
[23:12] comes down to where he says it like this
[23:14] on the Rapture he's talking about Kus
[23:16] and all had it he said balam had
[23:19] it but that don't have nothing to do
[23:23] with this
[23:26] Insight all right now what's he talking
[23:32] about so he goes to trying to do God a
[23:35] service without his will without being
[23:37] God's
[23:38] will it is possible a man or woman with
[23:43] all
[23:45] sincerity yeah sincerity trying their
[23:48] best to do God a
[23:53] service and stirred it in the wrong
[23:56] wayen
[23:59] right with a genuine anointing of the
[24:02] Holy Spirit upon
[24:04] them but Stir It contrary to God's plan
[24:09] for the
[24:12] age now sincere people well all we got
[24:16] to do is be sincere you
[24:18] know that's why I if it don't do
[24:21] anything in the world I wish it would
[24:24] warn you
[24:27] amen we believe in the
[24:30] anointings there's nobody in this
[24:32] building believes in the anointing of
[24:33] the holy spirit anymore than than I do
[24:37] I've told you about the things that I've
[24:39] seen and what he has done and how he'd
[24:41] stop me and tell me and direct me and
[24:44] Lead Me into
[24:47] things I believe in it but you can do
[24:51] every bit of that and be lost
[24:58] why because you're no more than the Old
[25:00] Testament yeah but brother Dale see
[25:02] that's what people say but but we're not
[25:03] in the Old Testament we're in the New
[25:08] Testament now according to Paul you
[25:12] can't be in the New Testament without
[25:13] the death of the testator is that
[25:16] scripture all right see we knew those
[25:18] things in the Baptist Church all
[25:22] right it wasn't something when I come
[25:24] into the message the problem was was was
[25:26] thinking about the way he was explaining
[25:29] the things but to think about that those
[25:31] Old Testament Saints didn't have the
[25:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost as a new birth
[25:36] as a personal experience with Jesus
[25:39] Christ we understood
[25:46] that but we just didn't know see our
[25:49] point was but them poor old people back
[25:51] there they just didn't know how to
[25:52] believe you know all he had to do is
[25:56] believe sincerity he
[26:01] says but you see you say well brother
[26:03] Dale it's just
[26:06] sincerity you can be sincerely
[26:10] lost Eve was
[26:16] deceived what about you and
[26:19] I you remember we're ready to turn the
[26:22] Rapture I put it in twice Brother
[26:24] Anderson looked at me across the thing I
[26:26] said yeah I got it in there twice he
[26:27] said maybe he was going to emphasize it
[26:29] well I didn't mean that much I just put
[26:30] it in but he saids that don't have
[26:32] nothing to do with this
[26:37] inside now when we get down to the real
[26:39] New Birth you'll see how valuable this
[26:45] is because to most people the new birth
[26:48] is just a form called a baptism of the
[26:52] Holy
[26:54] Spirit Well I got the quotes from The
[26:56] Prophet well amen
[27:00] in but like I
[27:03] said if we hadn't found these other
[27:06] quotes that where it speaks of
[27:11] that
[27:14] anointing where would we
[27:17] be well as the prophet said scriptures
[27:21] teaches the
[27:25] anointing you realize what he's saying
[27:27] Kus prophesied balum
[27:31] prophesied David done great things but
[27:33] all that
[27:34] anointing could not get that nature off
[27:38] of David
[27:41] right see then that lets you know where
[27:43] we're headed amen but then he gets on
[27:47] another quote off of the leadership and
[27:49] he's talking about he said but they are
[27:51] false at the bottom of
[27:54] it false at the bottom
[27:59] in other words the center of anything
[28:02] the real
[28:04] doings what about loving God serving God
[28:08] all of your
[28:10] life going to church all of your life
[28:14] praying
[28:18] fasting and be
[28:24] lost now that wasn't what I T
[28:29] that's the teaching of your Prophet so
[28:31] you got to make up your mind to do
[28:34] something but you said but what can I
[28:36] depend on a't but one thing and that's
[28:39] the word right
[28:42] amen all right you can be anointed to
[28:45] all kind of things now he ain't talking
[28:46] about one quote I got in here where he
[28:48] says a denominational anointing all
[28:51] right we can understand that we can
[28:54] understand a false part of a
[28:56] denominational anointing
[28:59] you know it would be contrary to the
[29:01] word but what about a genuine
[29:06] person that loves the Lord serves the
[29:09] Lord all their
[29:12] life and still be
[29:16] lost that's hard to consider isn't
[29:18] it especially when you deal with it's
[29:22] just sincerity I love the Lord oh now
[29:26] come on
[29:28] what did Brother around
[29:30] say you don't love with your body you
[29:33] display it you don't love with your soul
[29:36] it is either love or not you love with
[29:40] your spirit
[29:43] right all
[29:47] right well brother Dale you just make it
[29:50] like that that we don't have
[29:52] nothing if I can do that with you you
[29:55] know what if I can make you think you
[29:58] don't have nothing you know what you
[30:00] don't have
[30:02] nothing uh I remember one time a man on
[30:05] the radio he said nothing from nothing
[30:07] leaves nothing and I thought that's
[30:09] pretty
[30:11] smart if nothing from nothing leaves
[30:13] nothing then you got
[30:15] nothing all right but what about
[30:21] it
[30:23] anointed where he gets on anointed ones
[30:26] at the end time he's talking about the
[30:29] Commandments of God and he met another
[30:31] Prophet Moses another anointed one that
[30:34] had a genuine anointing of the same holy
[30:38] spirit that was upon
[30:42] Moses that's right he was a prophet the
[30:46] Holy Spirit was upon this man his name
[30:49] was
[30:53] balum but see maybe we need to stay on
[30:56] that a while and talk about about it as
[30:58] far as
[31:02] understanding because you say well what
[31:05] can we put it on oh that's what it is
[31:08] brother Dale was a Baptist and and he's
[31:11] not an emotional person so he's putting
[31:13] his evidence on just oh believe
[31:23] it go ahead and think what you want to
[31:26] but remember this man has has taught you
[31:28] from the
[31:30] beginning that I didn't claim when I
[31:33] came into this message I saw immediately
[31:37] I did not have the new birth and for two
[31:41] years I studied and prayed and fasted
[31:45] and
[31:47] cried for God to give me
[31:51] something that I would
[31:53] have an answer to Satan
[31:58] brother Mo said one day he said I don't
[32:00] know what you're
[32:01] seeking I said' I'm not seeking anything
[32:04] you ought to know
[32:06] me he said we just quit doing anything
[32:09] like
[32:10] that and said start
[32:16] confessing because what's the difference
[32:18] your question you you I ain't going to
[32:20] confess that I ain't got it now that's
[32:23] contrary to the Bible and the prophet
[32:27] right because the only way you want me
[32:30] to get it the only way you can be saved
[32:32] is to First confess you're saved the
[32:36] only way you can be healed is first
[32:38] confess you're
[32:40] healed I don't want to lie well you born
[32:44] one what's that got to do with
[32:48] it but you see then that
[32:52] anointing it's D but it cannot save you
[32:57] right
[32:59] right well brother Dale I shouted I
[33:01] spoke in tongues I cried I
[33:08] amen you can do every bit of that and
[33:10] still be
[33:12] lost well what can I put it
[33:15] on then you tell me and I'll put it on
[33:18] and here's what people do with me
[33:20] brother Dale you tell me what to do and
[33:23] I'll do
[33:24] it I'm not going to tell you
[33:30] nothing you know the way I am I'm sorry
[33:34] I've had people to come to me and tell
[33:35] me say I'm going to do so and so what do
[33:37] you think about it so well praise the
[33:41] Lord it don't matter where it's right or
[33:44] wrong because you told me you was going
[33:46] to do it you didn't ask me what I
[33:49] thought about it you told me what you
[33:51] was going to do well just go ahead and
[33:53] do
[33:55] it cuz you're not wanting an answer
[33:59] you're wanting me to agree with
[34:02] you right I ain't going to agree with
[34:05] you it won't
[34:08] work but you see church we think that
[34:12] well we're in the message we've like I
[34:14] told you two years I studied this
[34:19] message almost forsook my
[34:22] family to the point that I just all I
[34:24] done was
[34:25] read I have read
[34:28] six books in one
[34:31] day and listen to two
[34:34] tapes one to work and one coming
[34:43] home well brother Dale then what wound
[34:46] up being your
[34:47] experience the opening of the
[34:56] word please open to me immediately now
[34:59] that was the one that that's the one I
[35:01] get kind of
[35:05] uh a little upset about okay we'll call
[35:08] it
[35:11] that now brother colie come along and he
[35:13] said brother Dale first thing you told
[35:15] me when you said water baptism I seen
[35:16] I'm going to look at him and say you
[35:18] lied because I was there when he seen
[35:22] it it wasn't the first time he read it
[35:25] right it may have been but now I may
[35:27] have to use somebody else because if it
[35:29] was but he's saying
[35:32] okay you see I've been with a lot of you
[35:35] a long time and I've had people to come
[35:37] to me I saw it immediately as quick as
[35:40] quick as I read the prophet I saw it
[35:42] sister Gail shaking her head she knows
[35:44] better than
[35:46] that I remember her statement don't tell
[35:49] me I won't be
[35:51] responsible okay sorry I have too good a
[35:56] memory but listen
[35:59] church that anointing will not save
[36:03] you I hope you're understanding me it
[36:07] never saved them in the Old Testament
[36:09] now come on let's be sensible be right
[36:12] and don't go away saying brother Dale is
[36:14] saying that they was lost I never said
[36:17] that now that you lie if you say I said
[36:20] they was
[36:21] lost that anointing upon them would lead
[36:25] them to the best part that it could lead
[36:27] them
[36:29] but the sincerity in their heart was
[36:31] what God was looking at you want the
[36:33] Bible
[36:34] fart he said your sacrifice and
[36:37] offerings has become a stink in my
[36:40] nostrils but said an honest and a
[36:42] contrite
[36:44] heart is what he was looking
[36:47] for I never taught none of those people
[36:50] was
[36:51] lost Those Old Testament people were
[36:54] sealed Away by their own testimonies
[36:57] right they made it to Paradise by their
[37:02] testimonies and their lives and their
[37:04] doings it's why the prophet said look at
[37:07] them and then look at
[37:10] us Abraham had nothing to put it on but
[37:14] the fact that he heard God say get up
[37:16] and get out of this
[37:18] country
[37:20] amen he got up and took
[37:24] off and I thought we were the children
[37:26] of Abraham
[37:28] a man that believed god without the
[37:30] baptism of the Holy
[37:32] Ghost you didn't know the baptism of the
[37:34] Holy Ghost to teach him he could have
[37:36] the anointing to teach him yes because
[37:38] that deals in it come on when I said
[37:41] maybe we need to stay on anointings for
[37:43] a long
[37:44] time because that anointing on him could
[37:47] teach him great things that's he wrote
[37:50] six books or is it five five books or
[37:52] six books he
[37:55] wrote Genesis Exodus Leviticus number
[37:59] Deuteronomy wrote of his own death
[38:01] before he
[38:05] died evidently
[38:08] did CU he told about
[38:12] it but do you
[38:16] understand we you say it's an
[38:19] anointing it's just a you know what
[38:21] they're say now in the message that the
[38:23] new birth is just the baptism of the
[38:24] Holy Ghost
[38:28] that's been about 10 years Doctrine
[38:31] going if you hadn't run into
[38:35] it well you mean you still in that old
[38:37] stuff wanting to believe in
[38:38] justification s CH baptism and the old
[38:41] ghost I am right there still in the
[38:43] middle of every been that and you say
[38:46] brother Dale what do you think it takes
[38:47] to be born again justification by
[38:50] Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:52] sanctification of the unclean Spirit
[38:54] going out of you and trying to follow
[38:56] the word and the baptism of the Holy
[38:58] Ghost as the person of Jesus Christ to
[39:01] come and live in
[39:04] you that's right which would be the soul
[39:07] of God coming back on the
[39:10] individual right got remember the animal
[39:13] Soul couldn't save you so it's going to
[39:16] have to be dealing with the human
[39:18] soul all
[39:20] right what are you with me well brother
[39:24] Dale you just don't understand my God my
[39:28] God wouldn't do those
[39:32] things my God is
[39:34] loveing and everything and and he
[39:37] wouldn't do those
[39:41] things the prophet said the bride would
[39:44] be Tried by every word do you need that
[39:48] that's right the Bible says he'll try
[39:51] you
[39:59] brother randam said he I got him lay on
[40:01] my desk if you want him at
[40:03] home he said he'll try you to see
[40:06] whether you'll stay with the word or not
[40:08] try you to see what kind of an attitude
[40:10] you'll
[40:12] have he let something come your way to
[40:15] try
[40:17] you
[40:18] right was that what we gave there the
[40:21] other day on the God of this evil age
[40:22] where he said she'll be Tried by his
[40:24] word the bride see as Adam bride was
[40:28] Tried by the word and Adam's bride
[40:30] believed every bit of the word all but
[40:34] conf confused on one po promise that
[40:38] he's the same yesterday day and forever
[40:40] but failed on one
[40:44] promise I can just see those old human
[40:46] minds and people to why Hebrews 13 ain't
[40:51] wouldn't even back
[40:53] there how could Eve fell on Hebrews 13:8
[40:57] you failed On Believing him to be the
[41:01] same that he do the same and he keep his
[41:05] word we're going to be Tried by every
[41:09] word and it's not the denomination
[41:11] that's going to try me and you uh-uh
[41:14] folks come
[41:16] on we already have got rid of that a
[41:18] long time
[41:21] ago it's going to take the preachers in
[41:23] this message to try amen
[41:30] right why do all these doctrines went
[41:34] around to try
[41:36] you I was asked that question the other
[41:38] day in the Bible study brother Dale how
[41:40] come you stayed with
[41:42] it well I can throw a lot of stones but
[41:45] I didn't throw
[41:47] one I could say I had it and they didn't
[41:51] but I didn't throw nothing I told him
[41:53] the God's on his
[41:55] truth that's right I told him I said
[41:58] when I met God as a little boy there was
[42:01] nothing to Satisfy My Soul but that God
[42:04] that I
[42:05] met and I've always depended upon him
[42:10] and even when I was in the Baptist
[42:12] Church I depended upon him I had
[42:14] experiences back there of seeing Skies
[42:18] split up in a square and me looking up
[42:20] and seeing things I can spend a lot of
[42:22] time talking about things that happened
[42:27] to smell the presence of the Lord to see
[42:29] an angel in my home three different
[42:31] times I can talk a
[42:34] lot but where is that going to do you
[42:36] any
[42:37] good but if I can preach the gospel to
[42:40] you it can get dwelling enough into your
[42:42] soul to where you can get born
[42:49] again but did you understand let's take
[42:51] that part see but did you understand let
[42:55] me just read it brother randam says on
[42:57] message called Fellowship
[42:59] 62 we're all tried every Christian every
[43:02] son every child that comes to God is
[43:05] Tried by the word see if you'll be loyal
[43:09] to
[43:11] it when The Showdown comes what decision
[43:15] are you going to
[43:17] make that's it and he that cannot stand
[43:22] chastisement goes on with the
[43:25] world he is an ill legitimate
[43:29] child and not a son or daughter of
[43:33] God is that scripture
[43:36] right
[43:40] right you see you can have ever bit of
[43:44] that and not be
[43:49] right you remember there in the Kings
[43:53] Brother Dean used to preach on this one
[43:55] back in the Kings where the
[43:57] King I mean the the the prophet was told
[44:01] don't you go you go
[44:03] down and you deliver your message and
[44:06] don't you eat with them or sleep with
[44:08] them or stay there you get
[44:10] out he goes
[44:13] down he delivers his
[44:16] message but an older Prophet a real
[44:20] older a real Prophet goes and tells
[44:25] him well the Lord told me after he told
[44:29] you now that's where we need to put a
[44:33] little damper on that ain't it if the
[44:35] Lord told me water baptism in the name
[44:38] of the Lord Jesus Christ right don't
[44:39] tell me he told you father son Holy
[44:41] Ghost is right now don't don't just just
[44:44] don't talk
[44:46] okay that old Prophet said you told me
[44:48] said it but scripture said but he lied
[44:51] to
[44:52] him you know what happened a man went
[44:55] back ate with him and right while he was
[44:58] eating the Spirit came on the old
[45:00] Prophet that had lied to
[45:02] him come on if you want to read it I've
[45:05] got it right here if you'd like to read
[45:06] it off the screen First Kings 13: 6 16
[45:12] and stting read it down through there
[45:16] and what did he wind up
[45:21] doing the old Prophet said you went
[45:23] wrong
[45:25] boy but don't you think that that man
[45:27] looked at him but said but you told me
[45:29] God told
[45:31] you
[45:33] now I pick on brother colie tonight he
[45:36] comes and tells me the Lord told him to
[45:38] tell
[45:39] me Well now okay if it's
[45:43] right but now what if it's
[45:46] wrong
[45:48] right
[45:50] right now what am I supposed to do well
[45:54] a senior Prophet you know an old a
[45:57] prophet and the Bible he was a prophet
[46:00] of
[46:05] God come and said the Lord told me to
[46:07] tell
[46:09] you I remember a time happening when
[46:13] brother brandom I if I misquote this now
[46:15] you just put it in the right times or
[46:16] the dates
[46:17] or he told that lady she's going to die
[46:20] what it 3:00 I
[46:24] think well Billy Paul went to to a
[46:27] meeting they had or was somewhere or
[46:28] something he come back and he said Daddy
[46:31] it was the Holy
[46:36] Spirit see they told brother brandom
[46:39] said she's not going to
[46:42] die he said okay it's up to
[46:47] you said but God ain't spoke to me
[46:50] that's right that's what the young man
[46:52] should have said the young Prophet
[46:53] should have said hold it old boy
[46:58] God ain't spoke to
[47:00] me well you just stubborn
[47:03] amen what are
[47:10] you but what happened the old Prophet
[47:14] said you've messed
[47:17] up and said you will never go to the
[47:22] suppl of your
[47:24] parents something to that degree
[47:28] you know what he done he left you know
[47:31] what killed him a line
[47:34] right you know what was amazing thing
[47:37] when the old Prophet heard about it he
[47:39] got there and there stood a line and
[47:43] there stood the donkey that the old that
[47:45] the young Prophet had been riding on and
[47:47] the donkey was not
[47:49] hurt the line didn't hurt the
[47:52] donkey he just killed the prophet
[47:57] I thought we believe the line was the
[47:59] word he went against the word and he
[48:01] lost it because of that didn't he all
[48:04] right what do we think about
[48:08] it I've had a lot of people tell me so
[48:10] well brother D you're just so stubborn
[48:12] you won't accept what we say I said the
[48:14] Lord ain't told me I said when he tells
[48:16] me I I'll agree with you if he tells me
[48:18] you're right I'll agree with you then
[48:21] everything will be all right but until
[48:22] then I got to be myself amen
[48:27] me well you just won't accept
[48:32] correction Try
[48:35] Me Try in let's
[48:39] see but you see my point was Sunday and
[48:43] I'm getting is and then we'll just I'll
[48:45] just leave this as the message for
[48:49] tonight my point was one thing right
[48:52] morning service the anointing was
[48:55] wonderful it was right and it was of God
[48:58] and all of that and great wonderful
[49:01] things happened back
[49:02] there but that anointing never saved one
[49:07] person if it did why did Jesus have to
[49:10] come and die
[49:15] right
[49:17] right and as I said while ago you know
[49:20] okay I know what people in their minds
[49:21] run you mean all people got lost I
[49:24] didn't say that
[49:27] that's your own
[49:29] thinking they were saved for the time
[49:31] they were under the
[49:33] atonement was made for them at the time
[49:36] but it never brought them to eternal
[49:38] life in their
[49:40] soul it never brought a new
[49:42] birth all
[49:44] right then we were talking about that
[49:47] you can follow the Christ throughout the
[49:49] word but how many of you was listening
[49:51] over what I was
[49:54] saying could you see something else
[49:56] going on at the same
[49:59] time same time Christ was
[50:02] there the very person of God was in that
[50:05] Old
[50:06] Testament in many
[50:09] forms many times that he
[50:14] appeared to Mel as mesic right as to
[50:18] many things it was not the atonement
[50:21] that made the first I mean not the
[50:24] anointing that made the first atonement
[50:26] it was the love of
[50:28] God that made
[50:32] that see we can look at the anointing
[50:35] but do we see the
[50:42] person can you go back in the Old
[50:44] Testament and read it and see that God
[50:47] was manifesting himself in such a mighty
[50:50] way but it was a hidden
[50:53] Mystery that they couldn't follow
[50:58] they couldn't
[50:59] see see there's some of you that that
[51:02] wouldn't hear then I invite you to go
[51:04] back and listen to the message I tried
[51:05] to bring there Sunday because it would
[51:07] be greater I'm not I'm not trying to
[51:09] repr preach
[51:10] it I'm trying to make sure you
[51:13] understand then you can listen to it if
[51:15] you don't care about listening to it you
[51:16] don't care anyway so okie dokie forget
[51:19] it I'm blunt that's no
[51:23] problem but listen
[51:28] what about the very great attribute of
[51:31] love that God himself and all of those
[51:34] attributes that hung on to
[51:39] him can you look back in the Old
[51:41] Testament and
[51:43] see a
[51:47] person as he's revealing
[51:50] himself the Fourth Man In The Fire
[51:53] wasn't not an
[51:55] anointing
[51:58] amen
[52:00] right it was one like unto the Son of
[52:03] God that's
[52:06] right who was it in all of those things
[52:09] that was leading Moses oh yeah we're
[52:12] good to quote
[52:14] Moses you know about brother Brown
[52:16] saying Moses that it was Christ in Moses
[52:22] amen but you think about what he's
[52:24] saying
[52:27] was the anointing was what made
[52:31] Moses say Lord if you're going to kill
[52:35] them kill me
[52:38] first was it the anointing that done
[52:41] that or was it the person that was
[52:43] leading
[52:46] him there's a lot more to the angel of
[52:49] the Covenant than to just think about a
[52:51] pillar of fire leading the children of
[52:53] Israel
[52:57] Joshua found him standing on the shores
[53:00] over there and he said are you with us
[53:02] or are you against us he said neither
[53:06] one I come take
[53:09] over see we want to put the anointing we
[53:11] can see the anointing that was my whole
[53:13] point we can see the anointing but can
[53:16] we see Jesus Christ coming down through
[53:19] the Old Testament as he's making himself
[53:21] known as almighty
[53:24] God that would appear
[53:27] and
[53:29] disappear would take a form and appear
[53:31] to Abraham and eat a
[53:35] c the attribute of Love is what caused
[53:38] him to sacrifice the first
[53:43] animals the attribute of
[53:46] love was what caused him to do those
[53:49] things back there in the Old Testament
[53:51] that we see those people
[53:54] do cure the anointing of on Moses was a
[53:57] wonderful thing but remember with his
[54:03] anointing are you with
[54:06] me he smoked a rock the second
[54:13] time come on he got water you better
[54:18] think but he done it wrong because that
[54:22] was
[54:23] not the Lord telling him that
[54:28] it was the anointing on the
[54:31] man you remember a man that was Elijah
[54:34] or Elisha and the 42 children that were
[54:37] killed and the prophet said that was
[54:42] not God that's right but he said it was
[54:46] the power the man had in other words the
[54:50] anointing that he could call those
[54:52] shears down and kill them
[54:57] you see you're looking at things like
[54:58] that and destroying things and killing
[55:01] people and doing it because of the great
[55:03] anointing that Samson could kill a
[55:05] thousand
[55:09] Philistines but you're not looking at
[55:11] him as the what he really wound up being
[55:14] when he said Lord restore to
[55:17] me not my eyesight he wouldn't praying
[55:20] for
[55:23] that he said Lord get me back where I'm
[55:25] supposed to be
[55:28] and he pulled that building down on the
[55:30] top of
[55:31] him we don't see the Christ I mean we
[55:34] see the Christ but do we see the
[55:39] person you see I can follow the lord
[55:42] Jesus Christ all the way through the Old
[55:46] Testament and see him in all of those
[55:49] things where he was sparing the
[55:53] people when he would make the atonement
[55:55] that Moses would tell Aaron run among
[55:58] the
[56:02] people that was more than just a
[56:07] Christ the Bible says about him it says
[56:10] to the prophets he said I speak to them
[56:14] but he said not so with
[56:17] Moses he said I speak to him I'm
[56:19] paraphrasing it but you know it's the
[56:21] Bible he said I speak to Moses lip to
[56:25] ear let around said face to face that's
[56:29] the best way of doing
[56:31] it when he saw that theophany
[56:34] that as Abraham saw it he wanted to know
[56:39] more about it when Moses saw it he
[56:41] wanted to know more about it and even
[56:43] though he'd been in the presence of God
[56:45] to do all the things that had happened
[56:47] in his life he still wanted to see
[56:49] him he said
[56:52] okay you can't see my face CU right
[56:54] there end it wasn't time
[56:57] right he said just go stand in the Rock
[56:59] and where was The Rock I I believe it
[57:01] was the same Rock he stood in when he
[57:02] smoted it right that's a good place for
[57:05] him to go go back to the rock that you
[57:07] smok and stand the
[57:08] Rock and I'll go past you and you'll see
[57:11] the back part what do you see the back
[57:13] part of a
[57:17] man something
[57:20] real not just an
[57:24] anointing I know that message come on
[57:27] folks I know what brother Brandon we use
[57:28] the word anointing as the person of
[57:31] Christ come
[57:34] on I'm not dumb on that line I know that
[57:37] because I wouldn't have be where I'm at
[57:40] if I hadn't studied it out that
[57:42] way but I look at the person of God to
[57:45] be revealed in the
[57:47] Bible and one day he walked out there
[57:50] and a man says
[57:51] behold
[57:53] God has come down the Lamb of God to
[57:56] take away the sin of the world not an
[57:59] anointing sure the anointing was on on
[58:02] John to bring him to the place to see it
[58:05] when others couldn't see
[58:07] the the dove the lamb the things that he
[58:13] saw that's why he introduced the
[58:17] Messiah but the Messiah is not an
[58:19] anointing
[58:23] right anointing won't save you right
[58:30] matter of fact
[58:31] it's it's one of the ways God does to
[58:34] confuse a lot of people he anoints
[58:39] them I gave you these quotes just
[58:41] reading on with brother Brandon was
[58:43] talking about he's talking about and how
[58:45] that it moved on down the flopping
[58:47] against the lags you know what he
[58:49] talking about Adam and and Eve he said
[58:52] he couldn't stand it and moving down or
[58:55] it moved it down to the very Heart Of
[58:57] God spelled l o v e God so loved he just
[59:01] couldn't see them go he called them back
[59:04] said I'm going to put enmity between
[59:07] your seed and Satan's
[59:11] seed that wasn't
[59:15] anointing the seed of the woman is not
[59:22] anointing it is the very Christ himself
[59:26] the very
[59:29] God he comes on down into a message show
[59:31] us the father I used to think that God
[59:33] was mad at me that Jesus but Jesus loved
[59:36] me but I come to find out that Jesus was
[59:39] the very Heart Of
[59:42] God manifesting his father's love to the
[59:46] people
[59:50] right right
[59:53] amen he comes on down to where he's
[59:55] speaking on spirit spiritual adoption he
[59:58] says now the father today has put the
[1:00:00] right kind of a tutor over his sons you
[1:00:04] and I a
[1:00:05] select none other than the very heart
[1:00:08] and soul of the Lord
[1:00:15] Jesus you know what the new birth is the
[1:00:18] very heart and soul believe of the Lord
[1:00:21] Jesus coming in you and
[1:00:24] I now I've got something on that but I
[1:00:26] can't release it right now I'm sorry
[1:00:30] Hallelujah I've got to keep going until
[1:00:32] I get the right thing amen but I know
[1:00:34] right where I'm standing right there and
[1:00:35] if you don't think I do when it comes
[1:00:37] out then you'll know I said it this
[1:00:40] night all
[1:00:43] right that
[1:00:45] tutor is the holy
[1:00:49] spirit that's not just an
[1:00:54] anointing that new birth is not just an
[1:00:57] anointing that's
[1:01:03] right it is the person of Jesus
[1:01:07] Christ to come and live in you
[1:01:10] amen can you look back there now and see
[1:01:13] what I'm try tried to bring out Sunday
[1:01:16] that that anointing it couldn't save
[1:01:22] them it was wonderful
[1:01:27] but then at the same time that was
[1:01:29] happening God was revealing
[1:01:34] himself down through those prophets in
[1:01:37] the word they were
[1:01:38] bringing is it right that brother randam
[1:01:41] said Master peace Abraham Isaac Jacob
[1:01:43] and Joseph built the foundation he said
[1:01:46] but the prophets built the body the
[1:01:49] body's not done anointing
[1:01:56] it was a body brought out of the Old
[1:01:58] Testament according to Hebrews
[1:02:03] 10:5 they said a body thou Hast prepared
[1:02:08] me God was building that all the way
[1:02:11] down through there through those
[1:02:13] prophets the word they were
[1:02:21] bringing not just an anointing
[1:02:27] it finally brought almighty God into a
[1:02:32] human vessel that's
[1:02:36] right
[1:02:40] right but see everybody wants to go on
[1:02:42] the anointings and thing that's just
[1:02:44] like you're so suckered in
[1:02:46] by excuse me for those
[1:02:49] terminology that's why people follow L
[1:02:51] of these doctrines that are now that
[1:02:53] Jesus wasn't god Till The River Jordan
[1:02:59] but he become
[1:03:01] anointed on the River
[1:03:04] Jordan I believe
[1:03:07] that because that was the anointing that
[1:03:10] came on him on the River Jordan but that
[1:03:12] anointing didn't make him God he was
[1:03:15] born the Bible said Lord the
[1:03:18] Christ brother Brandon will say Jehovah
[1:03:22] crying in a cradle he said Jehovah with
[1:03:26] no
[1:03:28] teeth you don't listen to
[1:03:36] them but you see all he want is
[1:03:40] anointing oh if I just anointed it you
[1:03:48] know I thought that when the man that
[1:03:50] said that according to fulfilling Isaiah
[1:03:53] 61 I think that's right is it Isaiah 61
[1:03:56] where the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:03:59] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:04:01] the
[1:04:04] gospel brother brandham emphatically
[1:04:07] they don't want to state that one too
[1:04:08] much but he emphatically stated the
[1:04:10] anointing left Jesus in The Garden of
[1:04:16] Gethsemane be glad to give you all of
[1:04:18] these quotes I think that just rising in
[1:04:20] the Sun
[1:04:26] but he said that anointing is to come
[1:04:28] back in the end time so I want anointing
[1:04:32] I believe in
[1:04:34] anointing you know if you're not
[1:04:36] anointed you won't follow this
[1:04:38] message I want to be anointed to the
[1:04:41] word don't you I want the word to open
[1:04:44] to me that I can see Christ in the word
[1:04:47] but I can also see God's plan of love
[1:04:49] from the
[1:04:53] beginning that he came all the way down
[1:04:55] through That Old Testament just letting
[1:04:57] out
[1:04:58] slowly but nobody catching
[1:05:01] it cuz they're looking at the anointed
[1:05:04] they're blinded by
[1:05:05] it the people of this message are
[1:05:07] blinded by the
[1:05:11] anointing well I brother he's got great
[1:05:13] signs and W and old brother Dale just as
[1:05:15] Carl and and
[1:05:17] and it's all
[1:05:21] right doesn't bother
[1:05:23] me hope it don't bother you
[1:05:26] we just keep right on going down the
[1:05:30] road and when the question was asked me
[1:05:32] about what kep me I said because of my
[1:05:35] love for that God that I saw and I
[1:05:38] always wanted to see more has guided me
[1:05:41] and kept me all of these
[1:05:50] years that love that he had for
[1:05:54] me that I have for
[1:05:57] him it doesn't make no difference
[1:05:59] whether it's my family agrees with me or
[1:06:03] not I must walk alone with God a brother
[1:06:06] told me one day very wonderful brother
[1:06:08] that left us he said brother Dale I
[1:06:10] wanted to be close to you I said you
[1:06:14] can't do that
[1:06:17] brother I said I can't be that to
[1:06:21] you I said I can't be that to my own son
[1:06:26] not what you're talking
[1:06:31] about I said can't do it I said I got to
[1:06:35] walk alone
[1:06:37] brother I said one of these days you'll
[1:06:39] realize what I'm talking about you think
[1:06:42] I wouldn't want to be close to my own
[1:06:44] kids my own son a minister in the gospel
[1:06:46] I am in the right way of the ministering
[1:06:48] thing but the brother wanted to be close
[1:06:51] in a different
[1:06:53] way he wanted to be my right-hand
[1:06:58] man ain't nobody can be my right-hand
[1:07:01] man God is my right-hand
[1:07:04] man I got to depend on him if I talk
[1:07:08] that away in front of my own family then
[1:07:11] you know the honesty and sincerity of my
[1:07:15] heart that all I desire is one thing and
[1:07:18] that's to serve
[1:07:22] him to walk in the light of the love
[1:07:25] that he he's given unto me and then to
[1:07:27] try to get you to see that
[1:07:30] love that he's offering to
[1:07:33] you through the opening of the
[1:07:39] word that's the man that I'm talking
[1:07:43] about that's the man Christ Jesus the

[1:14:25] went
[1:14:26] up her and Rebecca will know for sure I
[1:14:30] never
[1:14:36] prayed I didn't have
[1:14:40] to she can tell you I never prayed for
[1:14:47] her Zach when he was a little
[1:14:51] baby he had the yellow jaas or what you
[1:14:54] call it
[1:14:57] I was deer hunting most of you know this
[1:14:59] to my wife called me and I said
[1:15:03] okay I'll probably hunt this afternoon
[1:15:05] I'll be home I prayed and I called her
[1:15:08] back I said
[1:15:11] honey do you think it's necessary for me
[1:15:14] to come home I said because I don't
[1:15:16] think
[1:15:17] so she said well it would help Terren
[1:15:20] and Lisa if you to come home I came
[1:15:23] home but have never prayed for
[1:15:33] him
[1:15:37] well I'm not against
[1:15:40] praying I hope you understand but there
[1:15:43] are sometimes that you don't have to
[1:15:46] pray you just say thank you Lord and
[1:15:49] walked right
[1:15:51] on sister Anna was laying there and she
[1:15:54] he was about about 10:30 last night when
[1:15:56] they finally got the doctor in there she
[1:16:00] looked over there and she said I'm not
[1:16:02] hurting none whatsoever that's right
[1:16:08] okay see it's not all in uh doing you
[1:16:13] think the anointing is you got to run in
[1:16:16] the hospital room and wake up everybody
[1:16:18] that's in that whole Hospital screaming
[1:16:19] and hollering about the Lord Jesus has
[1:16:22] healed you
[1:16:27] I never did see brother brandham do it
[1:16:28] that
[1:16:29] way
[1:16:32] right I never did see the Lord Jesus in
[1:16:34] the
[1:16:36] Bible do it that way that's
[1:16:39] right I thought that was the way we were
[1:16:42] supposed to be I didn't think we were
[1:16:45] were uh Jews having to do this out or
[1:16:47] the other I thought we were Gentiles
[1:16:49] that just says you know okay
[1:16:53] Lord I'm a man over Authority
[1:16:56] and I'm miss that and the other and you
[1:16:59] just speak the
[1:17:02] word I thought we
[1:17:06] believed cuz what is the
[1:17:09] anointing you know the definition the
[1:17:11] prophet gave of anointing most of you
[1:17:14] read it probably hundreds of times Well
[1:17:17] supreme power in
[1:17:20] control amen he never said anointing he
[1:17:24] said all of that anointing God he been
[1:17:26] running all over the
[1:17:28] place it's supreme power in
[1:17:34] control if we just believe
[1:17:39] it we just believe it just Anna I was
[1:17:43] tell s and sister Lisa downstairs I said
[1:17:47] you know I was laying there and I said
[1:17:49] Brother Sam come in sit down a little
[1:17:51] bit and I said give me my clothes I'm
[1:17:52] going home yeah put clothes on I home
[1:17:56] yeah all was
[1:17:59] well

[1:18:03] out of you and
[1:18:05] me it makes a great
[1:18:09] God that will do what we ask
[1:18:12] him if we believe it
[1:18:15] right the Bible does say to lay hands on
[1:18:18] the sick and we believe in that right
[1:18:21] but do I have to go and run you all over
[1:18:23] the place and get everybody to build
[1:18:24] told him to lay hands on brother dick or
[1:18:26] just or is it possible that I could just
[1:18:29] walk over and lay my hands on
[1:18:35] okay that's
[1:18:38] right
[1:18:40] right the Lord take care of
[1:18:43] things because he didn't say how to do
[1:18:45] it he just said do
[1:18:48] it see I'm talking about that person
[1:18:51] that was there in the Old Testament
[1:18:53] that's right why the anointing was so
[1:18:56] outstanding But Here Comes the person of
[1:19:00] God walking through that Old Testament
[1:19:03] right on out until he walked into human
[1:19:09] flesh and the prophet says he's still
[1:19:12] here now
[1:19:14] am so that we believe it Lord Jesus we
[1:19:19] thank you we just ask you Lord that you
[1:19:22] would just reach down and touch each one
