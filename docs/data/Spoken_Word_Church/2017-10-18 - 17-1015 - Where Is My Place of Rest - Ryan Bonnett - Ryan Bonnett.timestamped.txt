[0:21] thank you Brian their words
[0:26] simmer down is that like I've been very
[0:33] workers out the trick about that request
[0:58] anything
[0:59] we're going on that's how those that
[1:04] so you can act
[1:06] testing services there that's all those
[1:09] who are sick always run out here
[1:14] Farley blessings was tough
[1:22] oh I want to pick up right where I left
[1:25] off on the last lesson which I was going
[1:30] into a testimony kind of about hand
[1:32] graphics a meeting and that ties into
[1:34] this lesson really so y'all remember me
[1:38] telling you for the morning here this is
[1:40] this is Gabbie 16 years old right before
[1:43] coming to the message she was adopted
[1:45] into a message home and they have taught
[1:50] her about brother brothers message and
[1:51] she accepted it to Christ and then
[1:54] that's what she changed it to just a
[1:56] short comment so what I was counting
[1:58] y'all about last time is the symbology
[2:01] behind our meeting place and why was
[2:03] significant to me and then I did not see
[2:07] this when we first met this was not
[2:10] something that I had seen until years
[2:11] later but basically the story goes like
[2:14] this
[2:15] that we had actually been for the first
[2:17] time in the same location together one
[2:20] month prior to this at the Alabama camp
[2:21] through no six it was the last Alabama
[2:23] camping a lot of girl were there Josh
[2:25] testified about the
[2:27] car wreck I think Tyler said something
[2:29] about this or helping him with his
[2:31] homework a lot of how young people have
[2:33] testified I testified about the
[2:34] depression and then you have a got up
[2:36] testified about how about also
[2:38] overcoming depression so both of us in
[2:40] our life said gone through depression
[2:41] about the same time overcoming about the
[2:43] same time and we're testified at the
[2:45] same camp that about the same comment
[2:46] about the depression
[2:48] but she had prayed and asked the Lord to
[2:52] let me come talk to her because she was
[2:55] she wanted come talk to me I didn't
[2:57] think anything about her other than that
[2:59] it was ironic that she and I had a
[3:01] similar test
[3:02] but I didn't think anything about it she
[3:04] came she tried to get some friends
[3:06] together coming the perch is too shy to
[3:08] come talk to me they were all busy
[3:10] talking with her boyfriends and whatnot
[3:11] so she never could let that whole camp
[3:13] pass by she never did come talk to him
[3:16] and she said well just a bigger will
[3:18] well a month later
[3:19] her pastor brother Luther Dishman and
[3:21] Kentucky and host of the camera and it
[3:24] was at this campground and I've heard
[3:26] about it we've been invited joseline
[3:28] hope I think we're the man's oyster nope
[3:30] no I'm sorry I think from here that
[3:31] Lampley car pulled up there together and
[3:33] on Saturday afternoon October 14th it
[3:37] was 11 years ago yesterday I actually
[3:40] saw her sitting there by herself like
[3:43] that I've always hated to see young
[3:44] people sitting along to me because you
[3:46] know especially the youth camp you know
[3:47] you have all these cliques different
[3:49] people will stay in our comfort zones
[3:50] and all I'm going to try to them but in
[3:52] the kid that's left out didn't know why
[3:53] she was sitting alone but I just came
[3:55] over there to invite her she wouldn't
[3:56] come she was working on her little art
[3:59] book there she had been drawing a sketch
[4:01] of something on the campground and
[4:03] hello our first meeting was maybe two
[4:07] minutes long nothing really transpired
[4:09] that was pretty spectacular and I didn't
[4:10] see the little working and all the way
[4:12] but as I walked away a thought struck me
[4:15] from like without that said you know you
[4:18] need to get to know this girl and it was
[4:20] a really really strong feeling it wasn't
[4:23] just like it was made that she's just
[4:24] another pretty girl sitting on wrong in
[4:26] my mind didn't think anything over you
[4:28] know but then that thought struck me and
[4:31] said you need to get to go to get to
[4:33] know this girl and I was too shy to ask
[4:36] for a phone or anything the camp was
[4:38] nearly
[4:38] and we're fixing the dollar several ways
[4:40] that they've you never meet again so I
[4:42] commit it to the Lord I said north of
[4:43] day or will they work out for us to get
[4:45] her phone and she was too shy
[4:46] I was too shy that's what I'm going to
[4:47] work long story short it worked out that
[4:50] we got each other's phone numbers to
[4:51] stay in contact and we were engaged six
[4:53] months after that
[4:55] now a whole lot of more work working in
[4:59] that that waiting to see until your play
[5:01] here for us are tell you about the trees
[5:03] were symbolic of our lives to try
[5:05] consecrated of Christ we are new
[5:08] Christians so you would think that these
[5:10] would be like little saplings instead of
[5:12] fully grown trees but the fact is God
[5:14] knows in the mind of God everything is
[5:16] already finished working he knew when I
[5:19] started with Christ where I was going to
[5:20] go he knew that she was where she was
[5:22] gonna go and even though we're both new
[5:25] Christians he couldn't represent us in
[5:26] symbology in fully grown trees and
[5:29] that's something significant but then
[5:32] the whole entire thing was like a scene
[5:37] unfolding like a play in the mind of God
[5:40] that I believe that really he bought out
[5:42] before the world and and of course is
[5:45] something that I kind of thought about
[5:46] teaching on on sacrament go that way but
[5:48] it still is relevant that our lives if
[5:51] your predestinated to come to to Christ
[5:54] I believe our whole lives are in a sense
[5:57] laid out there's things in it that I
[5:59] want to take place I believe I've
[6:01] thought out a lot of the significant
[6:02] things in our lives before conventional
[6:04] world that there's just like a great big
[6:06] play unfolding we're just saying is like
[6:08] we're in the mind of God you know it's
[6:09] on the floor
[6:10] egman to comment about that years ago
[6:12] we're seeing the line with God and fold
[6:14] right after we met that was a little
[6:19] skip that happened in this little Billy
[6:21] do you remember that such joy today okay
[6:23] well I've never heard of the Kauffman
[6:25] family I had heard the store go down
[6:27] told about the man that there was a man
[6:31] man lives are of like Armour company or
[6:33] something like that all the bunch of
[6:34] ranches he sent his son down to I guess
[6:37] to Texas or somewhere like that and to
[6:39] meet a girl or channel to a like a
[6:41] Jubilee top of San Jose going on see all
[6:44] these different girls and final wife
[6:46] right
[6:47] I always girls present themselves to him
[6:50] and they were flirty and all those
[6:51] things he went out and to try to get
[6:54] away from all that Tom in front and he
[6:56] found this little similarly nobody on
[6:58] the back step that still girl all his
[7:00] character happened to be what he was
[7:01] looking for because he loves you for the
[7:03] protector this is actually the story of
[7:05] Christ looking for a bride right for the
[7:08] ground toll that story I believe God
[7:09] likes that story cause it says on the
[7:10] story he came down from heaven to look
[7:12] for bride he turned out all these
[7:14] denominations all their palm and bride
[7:16] and all those things and he
[7:17] meet something with his character all
[7:21] right
[7:21] happened to be that the very verses of
[7:23] that song I won't go through it for the
[7:24] second time but if you fall down the
[7:27] version of that song every single one
[7:28] I'm almost lines up with my knee got his
[7:30] story ironically down to the knot every
[7:33] little word but nearly and right after
[7:35] we had just met we went down there and
[7:38] they performed that play her youth group
[7:40] she wasn't in it
[7:41] but her youth group put on that play in
[7:44] this little building and we all watched
[7:45] it and there was no worse they were
[7:46] actually just acting and out while
[7:48] playing the common feeling song the
[7:50] promise okay and I'll sitting there not
[7:53] even know this is not story unfolding
[7:55] gone all these things out in this great
[7:57] big scene he will bring a young man who
[8:01] simply wanted to build a marriage for
[8:02] Jesus Christ and young lady who had
[8:04] similar desires and bring us together
[8:06] and house to meet there on a little
[8:08] sacred place in the hills of control
[8:10] okay but part of my point saying all
[8:14] that is that if you will stop and think
[8:16] down through your entire life all your
[8:18] journey even your natural journey
[8:20] leading up to Christianity and then from
[8:22] there throughout if you meditate on that
[8:24] you will find Christ in that I believe
[8:25] if you really look you'll find price
[8:27] leading along all through your life but
[8:29] people you come into contact with all
[8:31] your influences in your life your
[8:33] parents and how they raised you and
[8:34] everything about it I believe you'll see
[8:36] Jesus Christ in one more symbology one
[8:40] more little symbol about curve sitting
[8:42] on that rock where she was when we met
[8:44] was the fact that Jesus said that he who
[8:49] hears my sayings and does them all I can
[8:51] do to a man
[8:53] I'm Gavin Wilson more often and not only
[8:56] that but it says in the loop Jesus said
[8:58] that he would take down you know that
[9:01] the man who who hears my sayings and
[9:03] does them I like them to man who builds
[9:05] house upon the rock can you dig down you
[9:07] need to find your salvation you dig to
[9:09] find that rock to build a foundation on
[9:11] crime that takes bigotech searching it
[9:13] takes praying and seeking God and all
[9:15] those things and that's what she does
[9:17] she listen to this Bible ministry here
[9:18] at this church every you know week night
[9:21] from I'll leave at 10 o'clock at night
[9:23] girl works she sits up to midnight and
[9:25] listens to sermons of you ministers here
[9:28] brother for the life of the devil event
[9:30] the release of of the bottle over and
[9:32] over over trying to dig to build a
[9:34] foundation right this is for working out
[9:36] her salvation okay and that was
[9:39] representing the entire on a farm girl
[9:41] and that broth then there was a
[9:45] situation that came up it's not you know
[9:47] about some of you don't I'm not going to
[9:49] give you all the details about it but
[9:51] right after our meeting this is the this
[9:55] is told you last week about the same
[9:57] symbology of the rocks and the trees and
[10:00] all with crosses on either side of those
[10:01] rocks representing that same that same
[10:03] thing that keeps repeating in our
[10:05] marriage over and over and over again
[10:06] the trees on either side of these rocks
[10:08] of Revelation of Christ's cross
[10:10] represented in the diamonds and in our
[10:12] lives consecrated but there was a
[10:15] situation came up dealing with doctrine
[10:18] right after we had got engaged before my
[10:21] engagement that was I thought everything
[10:23] was ironed out and then and yet there
[10:25] was still something that came up that
[10:26] storm they left on turn or whatever you
[10:28] want to say that we thought everything
[10:30] was smooth
[10:31] we had a great battle to go through
[10:32] several months leading up to our
[10:34] engagement and that bothered me for
[10:36] years because I had frayed and I thought
[10:39] thought I thought I had done everything
[10:40] exactly right and yet there was still
[10:42] heresies among us then I thought well
[10:44] how can that be for one thing when you
[10:47] go outside of this church you don't
[10:48] recognize how sheltered we are here
[10:52] because our pastor combats those false
[10:54] doctrines and it warns us against those
[10:57] things outside of this church that's
[10:59] just message 101 just not being off the
[11:02] River Jordan and the sea dog then you
[11:04] come on the literal seed in your natural
[11:05] body when you're born okay the fact that
[11:08] this comes to life those doctrines
[11:10] outside of this church are like the
[11:12] Trinity doctrine in the Baptist Church I
[11:13] never even thought twice about
[11:15] trinitarianism about this church it
[11:18] never even crossed my mind that it might
[11:19] be wrong because it's just Baptist 101
[11:21] or Christianity 101 it's the basics and
[11:23] you leave this if you go outside this
[11:24] church so I mean those other churches
[11:26] they don't talk all the time about us
[11:28] not being God or about to come with a
[11:29] seed in you because it is the basic
[11:32] system like MasterCard is accepted
[11:33] wherever you go it's just there then
[11:36] nobody even stops and said where could
[11:38] this be right
[11:38] but we are privileged and blessed but
[11:41] only saying at the same time you have to
[11:43] be careful because you can sit here and
[11:44] just catch the vote with your pastor and
[11:47] say I believe what you're saying I want
[11:50] to start with you you've fought out
[11:52] these false doctrines and I'm going to
[11:54] start with you if you go I'm going but
[11:56] that's not that Wagner and I stay here
[11:57] for 5 years with that mindset I needed
[11:59] heresies I needed some dispute with
[12:02] doctoring to come up before my face to
[12:04] me to recognize because then I'm sort of
[12:07] searching men are really
[12:08] look Gavin I email folks back before for
[12:11] many months for months there are
[12:12] engagement trying to decide you know
[12:14] which way to go what is the truth and it
[12:17] was good for her too because she was
[12:19] sort of coming from that background and
[12:21] didn't even know it and Harold was right
[12:22] in the middle of the church that's
[12:24] teaching the truth and still wasn't
[12:26] really walking into it don't understand
[12:28] what I'm saying means I was blinded
[12:30] what's an interception now say about
[12:37] this whole incident I told you about
[12:40] this thing keeps repeating over and over
[12:42] in all the examples but recently our
[12:44] four year old who's now five EULA had
[12:47] two dreams okay I'm not a prophet
[12:49] on an interpreter of dreams but these
[12:51] were pretty clear pretty obvious to me
[12:53] that this was from the Lord and you know
[12:55] I'm not saying to brag but I know that
[12:57] when God when you do something the Lord
[12:59] Loxley likes the contacts on the back
[13:01] like you do what's your kids one of my
[13:03] kids does right I like to pat on the
[13:04] back so that's good version and it
[13:06] really good you're not proud of and
[13:07] sometimes when you're walking in the
[13:09] will of the Lord you don't expect that
[13:11] but yet God gives you these blessings we
[13:13] had our four year old at the time -
[13:15] before you look came up together one
[13:17] morning told her this dream you have you
[13:20] said you might want to hear this Ryan
[13:21] and I went to separate up to a third
[13:24] part I went to you than I listened to
[13:25] her dream and then I went back to Gabby
[13:27] and I asked her because you know a
[13:28] four-year-old changed the story you know
[13:30] they might make up stuff as they go and
[13:32] it counts the ones who told her yeah
[13:34] I've been what she told me was exactly
[13:36] right exactly
[13:37] the dream together so then I took her
[13:39] side and I put her in our room in our
[13:41] recorded it on video so three different
[13:43] accounts that she gave of that dream and
[13:45] all three of them cannot be the same
[13:47] thing so I know she what changed
[13:50] she went she said in my dream I saw God
[13:54] and I said you mean Jesus and she said
[13:56] yeah and she even explained to me what
[13:58] he looked like and even to the color of
[14:00] skin and the length repair and
[14:02] everything just like the Hoffman
[14:03] Enterprise and she said and I said what
[14:05] were we doing in the dream and she said
[14:07] well all her family went up to the front
[14:09] yard to play and her sister we're gonna
[14:13] go play me again we went up there at
[14:14] watch them and she said God was out
[14:16] there and there were two trees and in
[14:20] reality I only had one tree in the front
[14:22] yard
[14:22] okay and her dream she said there were
[14:24] two trees and she said God Jesus took a
[14:29] bed and tied it up between the trees and
[14:32] I said you mean like a hammock and she
[14:34] said like no but she doesn't know she's
[14:36] four she doesn't know what he just said
[14:38] God took a bed and tied it up between
[14:40] these two trees and then he climb upon
[14:42] it laid down to rest and I thought
[14:44] that's silly because God doesn't need to
[14:45] sleep but dreams are an symbology
[14:48] brightening dreams or symbols or
[14:49] something so he climbed up on the bed
[14:51] and he crested he got up from that she
[14:54] said the untie despair he walked over to
[14:56] me and talked with me and I said well
[14:59] where was farming and she said she was
[15:01] staying at your side so what's
[15:03] interesting about all of that is that
[15:06] when we do our daily reading and are
[15:07] praying and are studying in our home and
[15:09] my wife together with we're having a
[15:11] meeting with the Lord and exactly that's
[15:12] what happened is what's happening this
[15:14] crisis coming in dealing with me and
[15:16] with Gaby and it's like some minister
[15:18] pointed out there's trickle down economy
[15:19] of God right you have Christ as the head
[15:23] of the man who's ahead of the line and
[15:25] you know when he reveals something to me
[15:26] I always take it first to my wife and
[15:28] then she will break it down to the kids
[15:30] she's the pastor of our little flock and
[15:32] she will break it down in the way that
[15:34] they can understand so it's like this
[15:35] trickle down economy today and it's a
[15:37] family unit that can receive revelation
[15:40] from Jesus Christ and that's what I
[15:42] wanted to establish in the first place
[15:43] and furthermore say the trees represent
[15:46] me and Gabi and him resting in our
[15:49] marriage you know
[15:50] a place of rest and that's what we were
[15:52] trying to build with him the whole time
[15:53] the second dream about a month later she
[15:58] said that this time God came into her
[16:00] home she said he knocked at the door and
[16:03] said mommy went to answer the door and
[16:05] to me that was kind of strange I thought
[16:08] I should be the one to let him in with a
[16:09] home but really she does that because
[16:11] she gets the patcher of the home
[16:12] she's always when I'm gone driving the
[16:14] truck fifteen hours a day she's at home
[16:16] with the kids and she's pastoring our
[16:18] kids a little flock and so she lets
[16:20] Christ in the moment all those things
[16:22] are just symbols just to show you that
[16:25] that God is pleased with that type of a
[16:27] scenario I know it not everybody here or
[16:29] about you hear the tape has a believing
[16:30] spouse and that you're not able to do
[16:32] that you seek God in every single facet
[16:34] of your life whatever you can do and
[16:36] your public vows will be sanctified by
[16:38] you and your life but if you're if you
[16:41] have this available just don't neglect
[16:43] it I'm saying it if you both believe
[16:45] maybe can both come in and Entering
[16:47] together and have communion with Christ
[16:48] it's not to take place of private time
[16:52] with God you should still have that but
[16:54] then also included in your marriage and
[16:56] your child raising and your all these
[16:58] other things your job everything but
[17:01] every little facet of your life for
[17:02] Christ in it okay well the way that's
[17:05] probably our reason to pray without
[17:06] ceasing I always have a prayerful
[17:07] attitude have gone on your mind all the
[17:09] confident at work at school at church at
[17:11] home everywhere you go and with every
[17:13] relationship put Christ in it somewhere
[17:16] okay interesting thing about boys and
[17:21] Christina was start there to kind of
[17:23] back me up on this but we went to their
[17:27] home couple weekends ago and I'm
[17:28] interested in your story I'd like to
[17:30] know how God works in your life okay and
[17:32] so I went to we went to voices and
[17:35] Christina's wrong just to fellowship but
[17:37] one of the things I want to do was find
[17:38] out their story because I see the same
[17:40] thing in them that we have you know
[17:41] they have a marriage established for
[17:44] Jesus Christ and I wanted to find out
[17:46] exactly how God brought them together
[17:48] and it's very interesting how God
[17:50] brought a Filipino girl up to Canada and
[17:53] then I think she said it's rural through
[17:55] well surreal another cousin one I'm
[17:57] coming down to a meeting the brother
[17:58] Louise was preaching for a minute or
[18:00] interpreting a yeah and they met and
[18:03] released upon their first encounter the
[18:06] crossbar and something spoke to him and
[18:08] said this could be your wife
[18:09] and he turned and looked at her and I
[18:12] believe it's the same one that spoke to
[18:13] me and said you need to get to know that
[18:15] girl one woman who got it first had
[18:17] offered him a in Lawrenceburg man said
[18:18] you need to get done that girl this is
[18:20] how God works and Christine thought she
[18:23] was gonna she was in college to think at
[18:25] the time and she called herself a little
[18:27] nerd little chemistry nerd not having
[18:30] any idea about thinking about when I'm
[18:32] getting married being some men's little
[18:34] humble housewife you know God changes
[18:37] our plans sometimes they don't
[18:43] appreciate keep saying
[18:46] now the title for lesson today that's
[18:48] all background totally up to something a
[18:50] lot of women from them where is the
[18:52] place of my rest Isaiah 66
[19:05] thus saith the Lord the heaven is my
[19:07] throne and the earth is my footstool
[19:09] dude where does the house that you build
[19:11] up to me and where is the place of my
[19:14] rest for all those things have my hands
[19:17] made and all those things have been safe
[19:20] the Lord but for this man will I look
[19:22] even to him that is formed and of a
[19:25] contrast spirit and trembling that my
[19:27] work poor means like humble not
[19:29] necessarily professed British through
[19:30] this poor contrite spirit meaning like
[19:34] you're willing to admit that you're
[19:35] wrong you're always having a penitent
[19:37] heart draws that's not a forgive you and
[19:39] guide you and keep you on the right way
[19:41] and tremble it our about this definition
[19:45] this is my own definition reverent and
[19:47] esteemed highly because saying why do we
[19:52] need this it's not exactly trembling at
[19:54] the word of God if your mindset you come
[19:56] like throw the devil talks about people
[19:58] saying why do we make this everything
[20:01] that in this is pertaining to Jesus
[20:03] Christ is needful we need to learn as
[20:05] much as we can and God knows every bit
[20:07] of it he's you know it's him working
[20:09] through the powerful minister bringing
[20:10] us what we need so it's relevant and
[20:12] that's to make Trembley anywhere you
[20:14] take over a reverent mindset toward an
[20:17] attitude for it
[20:22] the objective is to understand how to
[20:24] prepare a place of rest to catch the
[20:27] headstone this whole entire lesson is
[20:30] about the capstone the headstone and
[20:34] basically again I'm talking about
[20:36] putting God in every facet of your life
[20:38] you're a personal quiet on your marriage
[20:40] and family your job in every way that
[20:43] you can always pray without ceasing and
[20:45] have enough a prayerful attitude and
[20:47] always have a ward on your mind where
[20:51] the ground said the bride is living
[20:52] below her privileges there aren't
[20:53] familiar with that quote he said it
[20:55] should be soaring the skies of God's
[20:58] great pleasure and power and this is how
[21:02] it works I think there are too many
[21:03] untapped unrealized resources in our
[21:07] lives that's what I'm talking about the
[21:09] meditation is left undone we simply read
[21:12] and pray and can come to church but
[21:14] there's got to be meditation they've got
[21:16] to be a thoughtful attitude about what
[21:17] you're reading keep thinking about what
[21:19] your
[21:19] what you're hearing great include him in
[21:22] your marriage and then your family as I
[21:24] said my brother white just things that
[21:26] we recently have a couch to encode you
[21:28] know we're about to cows we need to do a
[21:30] lot of cutting do you keep thinking over
[21:32] and over and over again what's being
[21:33] brought and listen to our sermons from
[21:37] this church
[21:37] over and over again Matthew 8:20 and
[21:45] jesus saith unto Him the foxes have
[21:47] holes and the birds of the air have
[21:49] nests but the Son of man hath not where
[21:52] to lay his head look a teammate I tell
[21:55] you that he will have been some speedy
[21:57] nevertheless when the Son of man cometh
[21:59] shall he find faith on the earth he's
[22:03] looking for a place he's looking for a
[22:04] bride to make you know we have to make
[22:07] ourselves available in every way that we
[22:09] can that's what I'm talking about your
[22:12] perfect man
[22:13] now dog or the Bible said here that
[22:16] steam is focus almond building temple
[22:18] and the most popular bread pan for
[22:21] heaven is my throne curve this my
[22:23] footstool and where is the place of my
[22:25] rest but a body I stop repair me and
[22:28] then there you are veteran all right
[22:34] this is a continuation from that a body
[22:37] has not prepared me God dwells in the
[22:40] stature of a man reflecting himself into
[22:43] that beings perfect worship I love that
[22:46] because to me that's not the anointing
[22:48] running the island than that that's
[22:50] anointed to and that's worship and so
[22:52] forth but perfect worship is what he's
[22:54] probably undergone in a man that's what
[22:56] he wants but he wants to dwell in
[22:57] someone he's probably found a place of
[22:59] rest so God in us being his tabernacle
[23:04] God manifesting all houses down that he
[23:07] would almost suffocating here from
[23:08] anything he knows about our Sunday
[23:09] school notice that God has always at all
[23:15] time reflected himself in man world down
[23:21] here
[23:21] capstone of Philippians 4:8 oh that's
[23:24] right
[23:24] if you reflux for a it winds up saying
[23:27] it for being a virtue if there be any
[23:28] praise right praise the top of the
[23:31] pyramid that you know one that's coming
[23:32] back into one one is immunity which
[23:34] Jesus Christ okay capstone which is love
[23:39] worship Him in spirit and in truth so
[23:43] I'll ask you three questions what or who
[23:47] is the headstone is it time to receive
[23:50] the headstone and how do we receive that
[23:53] stone so these first couple of questions
[23:56] basically are just about me convincing
[23:58] you that number one of who he is or who
[24:00] that's the steps on it and then is it
[24:02] time because if you don't even know what
[24:04] it is if we're going to see Patrick and
[24:06] if you don't think it's time if you
[24:08] think it's for another age within like
[24:10] what you don't see
[24:11] but if you you're convinced that of who
[24:13] he is and that he's here your bigger
[24:16] than concern my brother man talk
[24:18] about you I'm trying to convince you so
[24:20] you be more concerned okay and then how
[24:22] they feel
[24:23] so first question is what or who is the
[24:27] headstone found about one quote for that
[24:30] the sentence with Daniel that big stone
[24:32] come by and picked it up that big magnet
[24:34] stone you just talk about being some
[24:36] kind of factory I think watched all this
[24:38] the big man come by picked it all up
[24:41] because it's magnetized to it we've got
[24:43] to be magnetized to that headstone that
[24:45] that stone is the Holy Ghost Christ
[24:47] okay and every one of us that's not that
[24:51] magnetism of the Holy Spirit when that
[24:54] storm strikes the image the church will
[24:56] flee into flee to it back into glory
[24:58] shall be taken up at the rapture
[25:00] pressure it up the same once you go
[25:02] forth through that day the second
[25:06] question is is it time to receive the
[25:09] headstone the seventh wicked angle how
[25:12] about that Gentile church is in the
[25:14] Laodicean end of the way of saying if
[25:16] the Jews are in their homeland already
[25:19] there the Gentile apostasy which is like
[25:21] a rejection you know has already taken
[25:23] place and a lot of rejection within the
[25:25] message even though and we have a
[25:27] president like we have we have a nation
[25:29] that broke up like we have we have
[25:31] atomic bombs hanging in the hairs where
[25:33] the church is lukewarm and church people
[25:35] that pull their self together we have
[25:37] history the patterns and there should be
[25:39] no surprise for two pets the stolen when
[25:42] he comes
[25:42] what's left to happen it might be at any
[25:45] minute there is nothing else left or at
[25:47] the end time I don't know whether I'm
[25:50] going to be able to get into that gym
[25:51] early or not but I just want to get part
[25:54] of it too you know something's gonna be
[25:56] really small what does I got 50 slides
[25:58] and I'm trying not to have 100 you know
[26:00] I'm trying to put them all in in one
[26:02] slide as much as I can so I'm sorry you
[26:05] can't seal
[26:09] all right
[26:12] so I wrote down here I know sometimes I
[26:15] can't really fall well you think they
[26:16] know we wrote my notes but there's not
[26:24] this is one brother Wade had made
[26:27] reference to and Sunday evening this
[26:28] past Sunday
[26:29] remember he listed a whole bunch of
[26:31] sermons and pointed out the things of
[26:32] brother Penn's ministry and the
[26:33] progression and is this the sign of the
[26:36] insert okay is this the mystery of the
[26:39] thunders that will bring back the
[26:41] headstone you know I never break Munster
[26:43] brother way from the South he's actually
[26:44] asking a questions
[26:45] love you and always thought it was just
[26:48] trying to get our attention you know
[26:49] they're saying is this the time the
[26:49] answer and then going on to say
[26:51] something about but around the east and
[26:53] another place release another question
[26:55] you guys did a lot of question in these
[26:56] rooms trying to get our attention he's
[26:59] doing like these people in this book for
[27:00] you know ask them questions trying to
[27:02] figure out this could this really be a
[27:05] lot of it could this really be Jesus are
[27:07] they really here have they really come
[27:09] is this the mystery of the thunders that
[27:12] will bring back the headstone you know
[27:13] the pyramid never was capped the
[27:15] headstones yet to come
[27:16] it's been resented could it be brothers
[27:18] and sisters or that the third pole they
[27:21] told me three or four years ago
[27:22] the first boy remember what happened I
[27:23] tried to explain so don't do that second
[27:25] force they don't try and I fooled anyhow
[27:27] do you remember and then he said now
[27:30] there's a third pole coming but don't
[27:32] try to explain to see how I approached
[27:35] this his approach was humbled the
[27:38] contrite heart he was trying to really
[27:40] speak them to know and that's how I
[27:42] approach ought to be I don't know but I
[27:45] feel duty-bound through my church just
[27:47] say something you draw your own
[27:49] conclusion it's do it before my register
[27:53] that's perfect you know because most
[27:56] ministers today what would say well I
[27:59] want to know so he was seeking and I'm
[28:07] saying search for a mentor change trip
[28:12] that book chapter five one is on seeking
[28:14] the Lord and the Holy Spirit so much
[28:17] bigger life in erotic an aggressive
[28:19] temper right
[28:20] his spirit gave them a message for the
[28:22] church I want to bring it to you it has
[28:23] to do with the word and the bride so
[28:29] there's a law reproduction and so forth
[28:31] Steve reform efforts time the very same
[28:33] law applies to the church today whatever
[28:35] she'd started the church will come form
[28:38] LC composite is the same seat and these
[28:42] last days the true bride Church prophecy
[28:46] will come to the headstone and she will
[28:49] be the super Church of super racin as
[28:51] she nears hammer day and the bride will
[28:54] be so much like him that they will even
[28:56] be in his very image this is in order to
[29:00] be united with him there will be one
[29:02] they will be the very manifestation of a
[29:04] word of the Living God nominations
[29:06] cannot produce this long see that's
[29:08] right I'm still on the question of how
[29:15] do we OH
[29:16] still in the question of is it time to
[29:18] receive this headstone
[29:20] [Applause]
[29:21] yep there's a man who's on the line when
[29:26] I'm adding up whatever that is boundary
[29:28] and is making the valleys got a certain
[29:30] Tomlin has to put into it
[29:31] said his no importance iron his brass
[29:34] and steel and most people on down here
[29:36] and that's what Jesus has done by his
[29:38] bride he had to put so much Luther so
[29:41] much Methodist and so much Presbyterian
[29:43] so much Pentecost in it but what does he
[29:47] come up with his own reflection
[29:48] what isn't just like pyramid message you
[29:51] see it's evening right up this coming
[29:54] into coming to them on the way through
[29:56] when they hit stone or with the
[29:58] headstone the Ministry of Jesus props on
[30:00] earth has to be the same as the mastery
[30:03] he had where he can't come to it just
[30:05] like the head to the feet it's not the
[30:09] head but the head packs the feet or
[30:10] makes the feet tell you where to go and
[30:12] get it it's the life of son the son of
[30:22] this time now I've left the Pentecostal
[30:25] aid we're coming to where like in the
[30:28] pyramid not pyramid Bachmann now but I
[30:30] mean like as the pyramid the headstone
[30:32] when it comes to fit it's got to be home
[30:35] there's got to be a minister in the
[30:37] church the true Church of the Living God
[30:39] to where when the headstone comes Christ
[30:40] for the Ministry of Christ and Christ
[30:43] will fit right in together perfectly
[30:44] then that brings back to the demon to
[30:46] take the whole house and go to Gloria
[30:48] the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[30:50] through the brave Reformation pages that
[30:53] come out and gave their lives and
[30:55] persecutions
[30:56] my god but that storm is coming yes sir
[30:59] it certainly will come God will send it
[31:01] it'll fit all the buildings together
[31:03] upon giving this is a continuation of
[31:08] that one now we see these signs as we
[31:16] see the ministry from Christ beginning
[31:18] to narrow up mountain to the complete
[31:21] Ministry of Christ
[31:22] you know the pyramid any pyramid narrows
[31:25] as you get closer to the top and the
[31:27] fullness of the Holy Spirit remember the
[31:30] way boredom I'm preaching them Sunday
[31:31] morning from weeks ago we talked about
[31:33] fullness always for translation under
[31:39] Luther it was the same Holy Spirit
[31:41] education the same professional Wesley
[31:43] the messages then the bathroom the Holy
[31:45] Spirit making free trade on pre-stress
[31:48] the grace but for his stations on my
[31:50] product
[31:55] Abraham's covenant confirm that's right
[31:58] trying to cut them down and bring them
[32:01] to a spot to where when the bread
[32:02] capstone comes the ministry that's in
[32:05] the church and the capstone just come
[32:07] right straight together like a magnet
[32:09] make a seal writing together old God
[32:11] comes down to be up it'll be there don't
[32:14] worry it'll be there
[32:16] it would be there so let's just get
[32:18] ourselves to meet that nice comment
[32:20] cornerstone okay I'll get into the
[32:22] foundation let us love and project our
[32:26] lives in Christ and be sincere and stay
[32:29] with the work until when he comes we
[32:31] just fit right him back in like the
[32:33] glove over the hand like that what Sam
[32:36] oh that's the church that God's waiting
[32:38] for him--it thanks though
[32:41] the question then was is a time to
[32:43] reserve a headstone and he is a he's
[32:47] waiting for us so now how do we receive
[32:52] the headstone that's what the whole rest
[32:56] of this is about on another 800 Wow how
[33:00] that happened sorry I think I'll skip
[33:07] over a couple of these just say it's a
[33:15] man full of virtue of their error so
[33:17] when you surrender your complete beating
[33:19] then the Holy Spirit does forms through
[33:21] you and these virtues then you're living
[33:23] tabernacle when a manner when a man or a
[33:26] woman goes us these then the capstone
[33:28] comes down and still stemming at the
[33:30] camp by God which is there we go I want
[33:36] to just get right to the last few slides
[33:38] here
[33:45] you can bargain with bobbin no no I
[33:49] don't want anything it's hot given its
[33:51] time folks
[33:52] I'll tell set you don't turn who is this
[33:55] that's what we've got to do is make a
[33:57] decision what we'll do with it it's here
[33:59] you say how will I be able to just
[34:01] understand things that I don't know
[34:03] nothing about just say to make themself
[34:05] man be born again he cannot understand
[34:07] any of it
[34:11] tell you what this will be up on the
[34:13] internet just quickly for the building
[34:14] back up got him a copy of it upstairs
[34:16] did you want to go through this slide
[34:17] yourself that's not real people time up
[34:24] there kids actually 1022 10:00 a.m. or
[34:33] p.m.
[34:34] yep imagine I remember if you want to go
[34:36] 2 p.m. you the produce has to be in
[34:41] there before the capstone will even kind
[34:43] of on it they what rate the let 327 kids
[34:54] ever get there conservative so speaking
[34:56] in tongues don't mean you're of God
[34:58] working of miracles don't prove your car
[34:59] that's the thing the fruits of the
[35:01] spirit that proves that you're in shock
[35:03] when you see that life sealed away by
[35:05] the Holy Ghost God let it be let that be
[35:08] us if we've done sin - hello Father
[35:10] forgive us
[35:14] Sangster another way was making
[35:16] reference to a while back but that be so
[35:19] now brethren seriously think if it is
[35:21] then the pyramid is kept by the seven
[35:23] thunders metric do you remember the
[35:25] period message
[35:25] it's the capstone let me to do Holy
[35:27] Spirit have something to seal it with
[35:29] the when we added our faith by
[35:31] suggesting dogmas new faith and so forth
[35:33] keep adding it till we get to we got
[35:36] those seven things the seventh one was
[35:38] love which is God that's how he makes
[35:41] the individual and catch himself same
[35:43] with the Holy Spirit then if that be so
[35:45] he's got seven jerk edges that's had
[35:48] seven mystery that's been sounded way
[35:50] and they fought for to bring back and
[35:53] now the head stomp bones to cap off the
[35:55] church those the thunders main that my
[35:56] brother serves is that where we're at
[35:58] how much skip to
[36:08] and warm enough for Medicaid first
[36:11] medication medication hi this is
[36:16] something that let's skip down the
[36:20] underlined part I'm sick so he goes out
[36:22] the wood space takes the piano player is
[36:24] gonna go squirrel hunting and instead he
[36:25] sits over hit the tree and he started
[36:28] meditating and I'm sitting up against a
[36:29] tree somewhere
[36:30] sounds like brother Bell hands up in the
[36:32] air saying Lord what can I do today what
[36:34] will you give me for your children then
[36:37] when I strike something that seems to
[36:38] burnt down come something like this when
[36:40] this presents gets me I beginning to
[36:42] hear something welcome this is something
[36:44] in the sword to talk to 84 closer to
[36:46] come to 84 to two equals four seven to
[36:48] eight before but better are your piece
[36:50] of pestering on like that accredits is
[36:53] coming in you really think he's talking
[36:55] about multiplication I mean I don't
[36:57] think he's talking about math really but
[36:59] I think he's talking about I may be
[37:01] wrong but the basic things that you were
[37:04] seeing in Revelation we gon give you
[37:05] something start thinking on that and he
[37:08] was thinking on that good steward of
[37:09] that and then he'll coming out more to
[37:11] it Bank on these things the things you
[37:14] already know if God I think on those
[37:15] things right and then that's how these
[37:17] floodgates only we're making that
[37:18] chicken trouble a lot of time that's how
[37:20] it starts that's where you find
[37:22] meditation it starts off from editing
[37:24] your mind around gone out of the world
[37:25] away from the world out of the women to
[37:27] yourself some time to come to the
[37:28] sponsor of a certain spot then it stops
[37:30] for together and just rest down a little
[37:35] boogie seven saying great things not six
[37:38] but this I say he was so apparently so
[37:40] reap sparingly and that was so it was so
[37:43] it that we shall reap bountifully be
[37:45] rich toward God had be rich for
[37:48] last slide okay I'm going to go ahead
[37:52] and have y'all take one down and pass
[37:54] them around put this it's too big for
[37:56] being a fridge magnet but you can tape
[37:58] it to your fridge just take one and pass
[38:00] it tape it to your mirror or your prayer
[38:03] chair sister Regina friar Terry any
[38:06] wherever you pray wherever you meet with
[38:08] God take the sum around there this is
[38:10] brother Branham praying about something
[38:12] that we all have to be right about and
[38:14] it's really good run through it for a
[38:17] second time and let y'all be dismissed
[38:19] but don't forget these books are up here
[38:21] still got a couple I'll be by the horse
