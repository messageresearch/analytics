glory hopefully [Music] glory holy [Music] amen and amen and amen take around look around a little bit you might find him might be sitting right upside of you amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading on revelations 3 14 and then we'll go to matthew 1 be kind of an odd part but it'll connect the next two messages together so uh you know being odd using the scriptures what i'm saying that i'm i'll be using but you know just remember to pray one for another sister audrey is doing better she's uh you know coming out of it and everything she's been and we appreciate god taking care of that and and all because she's she's doing good and all my wife's picking up and getting better she's still having a lot of trouble with her her sinuses and their things or whatever you know congestions but just just keep praying for the lord would would uh bring her all the way through all of this and all this together remember all the others brother ron spencers and the different ones and brother carol different ones that are sick among us and things that just pray the lord would bless amen the lord willing this coming wednesday brother chris long will be here ministering for us on this wednesday so remember that brother chris long and most of you know him amen and uh i see anything else we miss him all right okay all right heavenly father we thank you for this day and your grace thank you for everything thank you for loving us lord because we know that if you didn't love us it wouldn't matter on the other end because there wouldn't be any for it to be for us but yet you loved us and cared for us and and guided us all of these years brought us to understanding of your word and your your being in person and things and we just thank you for that we ask you now to just open our eyes as we stop we talk a little bit about your word and we pray that you would just bless each one guide us forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in jesus name amen revelations 3 14 this is to this age right the message to this age and unto the angel of the church of the lady of siam's right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god amen so let's go over now to matthew 1 and we'll pick up a thought from this maybe it will tie together as we uh can continue our thought uh start verse 19 matthew 1 verse 19. then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee marry thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thy shall call his name jesus or he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and shall then they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us in joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had had bidden him and took unto him his wife and you were not until she had until she brought had brought excuse me and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn and he called his name jesus he may be seated to the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now remember what our thoughts is is connected and you'll see to why that we're using this because see his name is jesus what is the name of god jesus all right so that's simple we should keep that thought in our mind it should you know be no trouble to us to be able to understand and follow that line as to what we've been doing all right and see we've been trying to cover uh all the way back from the beginning and coming through and up now we are into the basis of the fact of jesus christ himself coming to be in human flesh and that's why we're using this and you'll call his name jesus you know and all because that would be tying together all right but see what did we see now uh if you'd like if you want some questions and answers on this uh turn in a question or whatever and we'll try to uh answer your questions uh maybe next sunday or whatever if you want to turn them in just just let us know and we'll we'll try to to cover them all right because i know in saying some things it's hard to try to hold a point and you know you read where brother branham says it uh god's first creation was himself well see then if your mind gets off on that and you get to thinking in the wrong direction uh it turns out to be the wrong thought but yet we ought to remember because that's what i've been trying to emphasize over and over is what does it happen god condescending stepping over into another form revealing himself by the opening of the word and and doing that then it it comes forth that there's just one true and living god and he's manifesting himself in many ways coming down to reveal himself to mankind all right and then revealing himself to us then we can see that it wasn't god trying to create jesus and jesus creating another one or something like that it was god unveiling himself or making himself known and making it another form that was our point that we tried to to emphasize that god making another change it into another form all right and see now when you look at it i hope you followed one thought that we covered uh in the basis of looking back there excuse me all right looking back there before the foundation of the world we can see that it can unfold and unveil itself down to where that we're living now all right then it'll keep unveiling as we keep going because it is the revealing of god to mankind okay all right now so we we're i want to get up to one point on this one number go ahead and pull up number four forgive me my coffin has developed again and you just pray for it it'll run out okay now brother branham calls it a new creation all right a new creation he tells us what's happening then god is fixing to make another creation all right now watch him he creating mortal earth mortal life angels singing in heaven but here he's creating a new life eternal life for man and he sing into his subjects true angels on the earth not in heaven heaven had eternal life see in you know and they sang to the heavens when the mortal creation come in and here this immortal creation is coming in and now they are singing see so you've got two things to be covered an immortal creation or a mortal creation all right remember how we've tried to bring that out make sure you hold your point that mortal is you know like dealing with natural things okay all right and god created first his spiritual being or brought into being his spiritual being through the opening of the word and stepped into those things and just moved on down to where we're at all right then he starts then and we got to that when we talk about the lord jesus christ coming that he got to that point of saying well okay now we've come to a physical thing all right see then when jesus christ stepped on earth he was a mortal being you know human being that body was a human being all right created for the purpose of death and in the different things created for that purpose of of manifesting itself all right and see then you can see that the spiritual creation of mankind back in in the garden and all and coming down and then it comes to a physical all right and after the lord jesus christ said he stood here on earth god made manifest in another form all right you can call him a son of god you can call him god you can call him all of the things because he's manifesting himself in many different ways in in to doing so it's it's just like the acts of a play that you just keep unfolding and going through the acts of a play and as it does then you can see that then the lord jesus is being made known and see what he's doing he's doing exactly what we said there the other week when it says that he's the only begotten all right and see then he made god known and god's making him known all right there on the river jordan then you see him standing there as he's making god known to the world you know in his life he's doing john introduces him the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world and the prophet said the greatest of all scriptures to think about was that scripture or that they're on the river jordan a great thing took place all right i don't want to back up into the message too much but we covered the new new creation he started a new creation a creation of himself all right not a not a uh a separate one okay go ahead to number uh let's see if i can get this one yeah go ahead to number number four a is actually what it is but it's the same thing he had started a new creation what was it a creation of himself god was made flesh and dwelt among us that's the bible said in the beginning of the creation of god god was created in human form in jesus christ his son god dwelled me he built this tabernacle of flesh and bones a new creation all right now that was what we were trying to bring down see you got he go you go backwards and you got the beginning of the creation of god okay all right this all ties together into one thing for this age to get the message of this age that this beginning of the creation of god is when god would come into manifestation and when did the prophet say god came into manifestation in the wound of a woman a new creation was made right a new creature all right see life begin with with you know the things of manifestation and showing and seeing god to revealing himself unveiling himself and see now he's coming to show that what his purpose is doing he's got to become human flesh to where that he can be the one that can pay the price all right and he's creating a new creation a new race not a different race now that music is is the same way as the beginning you take the word new and it sounds like something new well that's new now it doesn't mean it that way no more than beginning means the starting of something it's a manifestation or unveiling or stepping into another form manifesting himself to word that he can reveal himself to his people in another form and that form as we've come to now is the body of the lord jesus christ and that's why it says and you'll call his name jesus because he's emmanuel god with us all right and that was what was taking place but it took a little while for it to manifest itself into the manner that was needed so then look what i'm what we're trying to get to see he started a new creation god and man becomes one all right a human being steps up on earth to be our kinsmen redeemer to pay the price to do all the things and bring forth into manifestation that god and man can become one all right and see then that way you can you can put it into uh god dis unveiling himself manifesting himself okay let's pick it up let's get number five and look what he says about it now to show that he was the first also he was he's the beginning of the creation of god oh to you catch it how could god be created if he's a spirit how could he be he's eternal he never was created he never will be created because he was god at the beginning now remember how he was writing it the beginning what are you doing he's stepping into another form okay but he he that is the beginning of the creation of god was jesus christ when he was made manifest when god lived in him now that's a new race he is god's creation oh my see the first and the lies the amen the beginning of the creation of god when god created himself a body he come down and lived in it that's the beginning of the creation of god the isn't he wonderful all right the beginning of the creation of god what is it it's when god steps into another form and creates or becomes another uh not another being not another person but becomes the same person made manifest in another form all right now that's what we've been dealing all the way through and trying to get it now we've come to the beginning of the creation of god the beginning of the creation of god is the lord jesus christ when god created in the wound of mary the egg and the sperm to bring forth and to bring that body into being right that he would be at the beginning of the creation in other words another creation you understand me he's going to a new creation now we'll get to it to where we're getting our part of that new creation by the new birth all right but i want to hold it to the point this morning to where we can look at it the beginning of the creation of god is god made manifest in another form are unveiling himself into a bodily form that he can make itself known that he can be comprehended all right and we see that when the lord jesus christ were standing here see then he was here on earth in in doing and and following him through his life in the manifestation through his life all right see god was never created right that's what we just read he was never created we look at it and say well there he was he's a creator he's a new creator no he just steps into another form he steps into another form he's he never was created you see what you have you've been talking about created created no he wasn't created he just stepped into another form that's been my whole point for the past two or three services to get you to see coming down to the point now where that jesus is standing on earth the beginning of the creation of god or that god stepped down into the wound of a a woman and brought forth the body that would be the beginning of the creation all right that that would start a situation i don't know what you call it situation it would start a position or doing that god when man would become one all right now god and man becoming one is the most marvelous thing that can do i want you to just get to something uh let's bypass something here today because i want you to get it go ahead over to number uh number 12. let's get to scripture because i want you to see because we're going to say brother brown said this was the greatest scripture all right now watch it this is taken from the psalms and i will hear what god the lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and his saints but let them not turn again to folly surely his salvation is nigh them that are that fear him that glory may dwell in our land mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other truth shall spring out of the earth and the righteousness shall look down from the heaven heaven and earth is going to kiss each other that's what happened when the lord jesus christ came into manifestation in a human form all right so let's just read what your prophet had to say about it go ahead with number 13 now forgive me for jumping away over this but i want to get this point because we've been on the other trying to cover it and you should understand he's talking about says many people bypass this scripture but to me it's one of the outstanding scriptures of the bible that when heaven and earth embraced when god came down in the form of a dove and went into his son in the form of a lamb all right now where did that happen river jordan right river jordan is where the lamb and the dove met all right there he was the lamb was on the earth the dove came down and he said that was the most marvelous scripture that could ever be why because heaven and earth kissed each other what about that heaven and earth kissing each other in this manifestation go ahead number 14. i want to read these few where you can see it that was the greatest event this world has ever seen and we'll see now read that that was the greatest event this world has ever seen and we'll see until christ and the church has united together again now did you listen the greatest event was when god and man met heaven and earth kissed each other that's the greatest event until something else takes place what's going to take place look at it the world has ever seen and we'll see until christ and the church has united together again that is when god and man became one heaven and earth embraced each other and kissed each other and settled our sin question forever is when the dove and the lamb united together one of the greatest that's when the price when the greatest reconciliation that was ever made is when god and christ united in one as one heaven and earth kissed each other see we look at the scripture back there and we say well that's an old testament scripture of heaven and earth get sure but it was a sign or a speaking of the fact that the lord jesus christ would have to come into the earth and die to pay the price for this to take place all right heaven and earth would embrace each other he said the most marvelous scriptures think about it the fact that it would be so marvelous of things to take place that god would say that heaven and earth would kiss each other what when god and man become one now you just think about it you think about all that we we've tried to preach about jesus christ and all of the years and all that but just think about it that when god and man becomes one that was when jesus christ walked on the shores of galilee most marvelous scriptures the most outstanding things right there took place that when god and man become one the prophet said that is the greatest of all outside of the fact of the church see why because the church has got to become one with god that's why i just bypass that i want to get over to this that heaven and earth would kiss each other that's happening again in the end time god and man is becoming one again in the bride of jesus christ all right see because that's the promise the promise of that being of that to take place and heaven and earth would kiss unite together you realize then the bible says in god that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself all right see in that body was a human element a new creature now follow me for a minute a new creation not another creation not something else different but see back there before the world there he stood as that form if you want to look at it that we've spent so much time trying to divide it to see it you know and looking at it as to know that it's a form of a man god is in in the form of a man he he's not a glob he's not a spirit just floating around or whatever he's god and man become one in jesus christ you think about it an opportunity for sin to be covered through this one that would give the price all right and see then it would be that heaven and earth would kiss unite unite together heaven and earth would unite see it would take the one there had to be one to come to be our kinsman redeemer all right to pay the price for all of the doing and it does and it it would make a new creation distinct from the old creation you know all right a new creation would be made to worthy you could look at him and see there's almighty god living on earth in the human flesh called the lord jesus christ all right and that would be even until the bible would call it heaven and earth kissing it would cover it to the basis that they would be god and man would become one in a new creation not a not another creation now it's not changing something else it was god stepping over into another form in a new creation a new new beginning as we'd call it but not something to worry that you you say well that's that's where you begin no that's word that you and i had our opportunity see the lord jesus christ paid the price and as he paid that price then heaven and earth kissed each other right there on that river as it was doing that was the most marvelous time that could ever be to see that god would come down and dwell in in mankind and make a new creature you realize then what happened see the lord jesus christ is the beginning of the creation of god how did he begin in the wound of a virgin mary right made a new creature a new creation may god and man become one and look at it from the basis of what what that is and then let's jump over they don't have this one but i'll i'll just read it off and and we can we can take part of it and understand listen the beginning of the creation of god that is who the lord jesus says he is those words don't mean exactly as they sound to us just taking them the way they sound has made some people in fact multitudes of people get the idea that jesus was the first creation of god making him lower than godhead see he wasn't the first creation of god he was god in another form are you following me he was god in another form not god in another person not god in another do it but yet he was he's stepping into flesh to where that he can can we can understand then the first creation create all the rest and and whatsoever it contains but that is not right they got it up now you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the bible the words are the beginning or author and he goes through the fact of how showing that jesus is very god john 1 and then he goes back to to genesis 1 and he goes over to exodus and all the things and look what he says surely we can see what these words mean to have any other interpretation would mean that god created god how could god create be created when he himself is the creator but now he is standing in the midst of the church amen now where's he at are you following me heaven and earth kissed each other when jesus christ came into human flesh where's he at now he's still in that human flesh he still has that flesh but yet now what's he tying together so listen what he's saying but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands out revealing who he is in this life's age he calls himself the author of the creation of god this is another creation this has to do with the church look this has to do with the church not a different creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride right so now watch what he's saying this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as the spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the cells from which his body was born i want to repeat that he created the very cells in the wound of mary for that body it was not enough of enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to a human over him supplied by mary but that would have been that would have been sinful man producing a body see it won't work that's why you've got to have your virgin birth you can't you can't have it all right that would not have produced the last adam all right he was of the new creature god and man met and joined he was the first of this race he's the head of this race now listen trying to bring it over to a feist run through from where we were that looking back there what was he almighty god manifested as we call him the jehovah the old testament but then it comes forth and here is the jesus of the new testament and who is he he's the beginning of the creation of god he created in the wound of a mayor of mary the body that would come forth to be that body that a body thou has prepared me all right now he's coming back as bride form me now he's coming to his true point if it was true that what we were saying while ago that the greatest scriptures of all is where god and man met and heaven and earth kissed each other and he said that was the greatest thing that could have ever happened when that took place what about when it takes place in the bride of christ when are we going to realize our position a new creature a new creation not a different creation not something different it's exactly what he done he came down and gave his life that you and i could have eternal life and to do that makes us a new creature as paul calls him in christ all right that new birth that you receive that new birth is what we're talking about is that new birth comes down into a human element and dwells in a human element because that's what happened back there with the first creation god come down brought that human element into being all right that human element was a body it was not eternal jesus's body was not eternal it had to be made eternal in the resurrection and the change and the thing in the ascension then it was made eternal all right see then it made a way to where the eternal life could be imparted for you and i a new creature a new creation brotherhood said he's no longer dealing by ways of the old doing you know he said he dealt with abraham and he lied he dealt with moses and he done this he's done that no this is this is not it this is a new creation in christ jesus the new birth then is the most important thing that you could ever think of in life because that's what makes you a new creature it makes you a new creature not another creature not a different one it makes it what it's supposed to be it makes us coming to finality the way the lord jesus came to it his body had to be made eternal well because it was it had a beginning all right but he was a new new creation why because there back in the old testament you couldn't see god and understand you couldn't follow her you know you he he would talk about the things but even when he come on earth and dwelt on earth to try to manifest himself for us to see him he still was so hidden to mankind until we couldn't comprehend it it takes the new birth and you and me to understand a new creature he was a new creature god and man became one that's a new creature that's what the new birth is to me and you that's right are you following me the new birth to me and you is god and man becoming one and that's seeing who we are and what's taking place and us dying out to ourself and accepting jesus christ as our savior making us part of that new race a new race of people was brought you talk about see as i said we we tried to figure out what did he look like what was he how did he look was he big little or whatever you know no just forget all of that and look at mankind and see what mankind is and you'll see what god was before the world because he made man in his own image right all right and see then when he made him in his own image then you come down to where we are now that is christ in you the hope of glory a new creature you're a new creature in christ jesus you're not the old and made over see you're not just even starting out of justification and sanctification and go so far and turn back no it's the new creature right go all the way until we become a new person in jesus christ that god and man can become one again like it was back there you think what a wonderful day would be there for to be able to see him walking on the shores of galilee but what about now with me and you that he's living in you and me it's christ in you the hope of glory is god made manifest in another form called the bride that makes her a new creature in christ jesus we're not just the old creature made over polished up or done you got to totally die to yourself and be born again and then when you're born again see then you become a new creature a new creature in christ jesus see not another one but a new creature you become like he was you say yeah but we can't never be like him see after a point we take it the wrong way we say well we can't be like him well you know he was special he was a 20 he was a 16 element body sure he was god made manifest sure but he was also a man and he walked the shores of galilee and he gave his life to where we could have life a new creature see when jesus christ came into being back there in the old testament as the word see did he become a new creature the word i was thinking about that this week and thinking that that's hard probably for the mind to comprehend that you you go back to the beginning and you talk about the word well you're not talking about letters on a page you're not talking about some kind of doing direction now you're talking about how god made himself manifest in a human element to where that he could pay the price then what we got to do is relax and accept that point except what he said a new creature yes a new creation as paul said old things is passed away and all things are made new all right and if it's true like i said if it's true that heaven and earth kissed each other and that's a wonderful thing when the lamb and the dove met there on the river jordan sure that was a wonderful time that was a great opportunity when god and man become one you know in full manifestation all right but what about when god and man becomes one in you yeah but i i just can't say i just can't think that he could come and be that connected to me why not that's where the trouble's at if he's a new creature why can't we be a new creature if he's a new creation why can't we be a new creator right because that's what it is you see it's it's made to work that god could give his own life and then come back and live in the man heaven and earth kissed each other god and man become one and they did he's the only he's the only begotten of the father right you know we spend a lot of time i think about it the other day you ought to run this in sometime we think a lot of times about abraham you know and we say that well well thy son died only son when we're talking about abraham we said see there then uh um you know isaac would have been the only son ishmael would have been to not to promise me all right and we say well that wasn't his son it was his son but it's making a point and the bible says that he is to be only begotten you realize that isaac was the only begotten of abraham what your bible says brought into manifestation as to be what he's supposed to be where it could be the promised seed all right see a new creature came into being back there 2000 years ago you see yeah but it had to be yeah it was before then sure we know that we know that he was a human being we know that he came forth and manifested himself in in many ways in many forms and and and all like that but yet it really all happened 2000 years ago when god and man become one but can we say that we're one with god like that if we die to ourselves and accept him as our savior heaven and earth can kiss each other and has done it through the the very fact of a new birth a new birth a new birth a simple point of a new birth brings us to a position that god and man can become one god and man we can become one in manifestation and be a new creature a new creation see that's what we are we're a new creature we're a new creation god's not dealing by ways of the old no more he's dealing by ways of the new creation it's christ in you the hope of glory god and man has become one through the opening of the word that's my whole point now to get it for for a few minutes for you to think about it you say well it's hard for me to understand how that back before there that you'd say that there was was a self-existing one and all and then he comes down and he comes to logos and logos to theophany and theophany to word all right well just remember you've got to think a whole lot about a lot of them things because in that form that he was in back there he was in form of a man he was in form of a man see then when you come down to where that god and man then can become one and you accept him as your savior then now you're back to that new creation you're back to the point that it's supposed to have been the whole time a new creature a new creation if we're we're a different creation now listen to what i'm saying about it i don't misunderstand me into the wrong point we're all human mortals everybody in the world has 16 elements of mud and potash and different things all of that all right but just remember that by the new birth you are not of that old race you're not of that old race you see yeah but we still are sure we're human beings because we're here but god has made a way that where he could come and live in us in the new birth and manifest himself and make a new creature a total new creation we're we're a new creation we're not the old creation just polished up we're a new creation we're we're in that manifestation of god and man becoming one why shouldn't we be honored and glory into the point of what we are and what god has made us he's made us these things you know you say are you trying to make us a different race of people no we're all a human race we're all in one human race right was listening last night where brother branham was talking about and he said he's talking about racism and things you know and he said that talking about it doesn't matter whether it's black white yellow green brown or whatever it is said we're all the same well that's true see we're all the same there's no big eyes a little used in this thing or nothing but the only way that you'll ever be anything is for that new creature to come inside that'll solve the racial problems that solve all worlds situations it's for them to get to new birth and become a new creature not a different one just take this creature that we are and justify it sanctify it fill it with the holy ghost and we are a new creature in christ jesus see if heaven and earth could meet together and kiss and it be a glorious opportunity what about when it meets in you and i am to bring this manifestation into to do it see one of these days somebody's going to walk off of this earth yes all right i want to do that don't you i want to i want to get out of here all right but see i know and realize that the world is not in that but see you're a special people created for a purpose right created for a purpose he was a special person that body was created for a purpose all right and see then that's what he's doing on me and you the statue of perfect man he's building a new creation not a different one now not another one he's not not don't don't take me wrong it's the point that he's giving us an opportunity to become what he is a new creature a new creation god and man met back there in a new creation what do you think is going to happen here when the bride realizes what's going on yeah but see that's that's where our problem is we say but but brother dale you you can't make us so much we're just a human being like the rest all right i'll agree with you we're a human being we're of the human race all right but for some reason god chose you right he chose you for some reason what was the reason well now now we know it and we we know we know the truth about it it's not he just picks and chooses something no but what if he is watching the way we live and what we do and the things that we walk and do what if he is watching that we could be a new creation in christ jesus walking up on this earth in a manifestation a different people something to be different he said but we're not supposed to be different we just i ain't talking about that we are different some reason some something happened in your life somewhere that brought you to a position to find this message right why it wasn't something we was doing [Music] but he was looking at that new race of people a new creation he's proud of this new creation he's making it manifest what you think about it what about it another creation no longer dealing by ways of the natural things but dealing by the ways of the spiritual right a new creation he said it's not the old creation made over or it wouldn't be called a new creation see it's another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with israel and abraham and all that he was god's god brought a creature into being years ago i don't like to use that word like that but what else you going to call it see whereas man was trying to figure out what god looked like and god was trying his best to show man what he was allowing him to see and understand that all he's got to do is just accept jesus christ as his savior and then let him start working on that a new creature a new creation all right you don't have to act different we are different you don't have to make yourself something we are something yeah but you're trying to make us some kind of a natural thing well what are you trying to make us there is a lot of this that is natural a creature it is a new creature a new creation god and man becomes one the war they can actually manifest themselves all right the beginning of the creation of god god created himself a body and come down to and lived in it that's the beginning of the creation of god god created a body come down and lived in that and made that to be him god himself in the human flesh a new creature now if you pinched him he felt it but yet he was a human come to give us to pay the price you don't get nothing out of anything on just get that little bit right there because that's the point i've spent so much time on trying to express what he was before the foundational world until now i'm hoping we'll try to get to the places of looking at what he is now a new creature a new race of people what about a new race of people coming on earth but yet it's not like we're looking at it then it's not a new race like that it's a race of people that are born again christians that should be our thoughts that should be the the point that we should always do see god's only begotten son all right but that wasn't a a different person that's god made manifest just in another form god in you is not another person it's god made manifest in another form when are we going to realize that and come to that position of doing it all right think on these things i know it just walked off short but i've tried to express a lot of about the past and the things until now it's time for us to settle down into what we are right now christ in you the hope of glory god coming down to live in mankind yes the way that he's always wanted it the way he's always tried to get it to be come on come on musicians think on these things a new creature a new creation god in man becomes one [Music] what about it are we part of that race or were we just talking about it well well brother there we've always preached about new new races and you think but still it's not making it manifest i want to see it made manifest in your life in my life i want to see god made manifest in the humor of people come on let's stand together i want us to see god living in people this afternoon wave to be ministered and also remember then brother long will be ministering for us wednesday pray that the
