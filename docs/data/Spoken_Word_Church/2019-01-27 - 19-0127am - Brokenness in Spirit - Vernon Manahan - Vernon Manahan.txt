I've been in Maryland for 20 years but I remember yeah that old [Laughter] brother and uh at that time I had no idea that God would move us to back to Georgia we we weren't looking we were steady working I'd been there for almost 20 years and to see how God has worked things out and brought us all back down to Georgia and then brother Vernon's here and as I said next week we'll be there with

glory and pour out your power and love sing Oh holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see I want to see you amen hallelujah hallelujah uh good morning everyone and i' would like to bring you the greetings from the Philippines and our church there in uh in in Manila brother our pastor here brother samale and that the privilege to be there last 2005 and B Wade in 2015 and so uh they they know you they they watching your services here once in a while and uh and of course uh they know that I'm here right now and uh we are thankful that the Lord has brought our has brought us here by his grace can you be SE for a while just uh uh I will bring greetings to from the people uh in the Philippines and of course you know most of the ministers who have been here before brother roel brother Danny brother Nestor I think brother lanlan also these are the pastors that have been here in the past and it's always good to see uh to know that when you go to a certain pulpit and uh a certain church and the pastor does not introduce you anymore that means you are at home right yeah because I I have been here I think the first time that I I I first went to the US was in 2002 and uh during that time um I think brother Samuel deas he hosted a Miss missions meeting here where brother Ed bisc was the the speaker and uh since it was a missionary meeting they invited me to come over that he we we don't know each other yet during that time and I was there to speak about uh what Bible Bible Way was doing the Philippines of all this translation and distribution and printing of books so uh that was the first time I uh met brother samale in that meetings I was not able to go to this church but um we we had some other schedules but uh I mean I met the brothers and and the sisters and I was just thankful and uh again um maybe a couple of years uh later or three years later brother Samuel um went to the Philippines with brother Ernie and you know all all of you know brother Ernie and uh we went around the Philippines um we we went to some Churches and I I I'm not particularly sure what the exact man but it was that time that Brother Sam started supporting the Mission Works in the Philippines sending uh this um funds for for different churches and I I would say that this it has accomplished a lot in our country in the Philippines helping the brothers and sisters in in the in the countryside but not only that in the past few years I have been engaged together with brother Nestor and brother Danny in the Asian missions uh so we we were able to reach out to the other countries like Cambodia Thailand Vietnam even to the Pakistan so and the brother Samu has always assisted us in those M me uh Mission Works so uh we don't know where the last is laying amen but uh if the Lord leads us to go into some place then we just do it our as the Lord leads and uh I I would say that uh your church here has been a part of those Mission Works so whatever is accomplished there I believe uh uh we are all part of it in prayers in uh in your support in the financial support and everything and so um I I would say we we we baptized uh recently in the last in our last few trips in Cambodia we have baptized about nine Souls there just just continue to add to the Lord it might not be as many as Believers in the Philippines amen because as you know Cambodia is predominantly a uh Buddhist country so they don't have no knowledge any whatsoever about the Bible but when you start I mean when the Lord starts opening their eyes then uh we we're just thankful with the what the Lord's doing and what we are doing is just a small part of the big move of the lord it's nothing not not that we are great or anything but we believe that uh it's just a privilege that uh the Lord helped us to be part of those it was really brother Nestor brother Danny who he spearheaded those Asian missions um way back in the early 2000s so uh the Lord is now uh yielding we can see now the fruits of all their labors and we thank you for all your prayers and so we I'm here the on my fifth time I believe the last time I was here was the 40th anniversary or I don't know what how many years but that was the 4th of July uh 2015 and I remember I was in the immigra in the immigration there and the the immigration officer just put me on hold and he said so why are you here and I said I'm a pastor so again he asked a question so why are you here I said I was invited to to preach for for a church here in their Church anniversary and of course I have the documents and all the invitation but you know sometime in the immigration they they try to test you and so he said if you're a pastor what what will you you what what are you preaching on Sunday and I said since it's the 4th of July then I'll be preaching on the book of Exodus it's about Liberation anyway so and so he didn't ask any more question and so sometimes you have to just go around them you know and uh uh but I'm thankful that uh this my fifth time and uh being the fifth time is you know number five is the number of Grace and by God's grace I have my wife here with me Irene amen this is our first time to be in the US uh we just came from Brother Ed bcal Church a week ago and uh I was telling when we were younger I cannot bring her to me when we we when I fly because uh our children were still small during that time but now they're all graduate uh from they have graduated from school one is already married four already adults and they all uh have their own work so I guess I told my wife uh you can come with me don't wait until we 75 years old can we cannot walk anymore that much so at least she will experience what she was seeing in the pictures when I was going here and going there and uh I I always uh prayed to the Lord that one day I'll bring her here because the family of brother samale as I I told before they're like family to me I mean um brother Wade and brother Terrence and their family sister Anna I was I was I was surprised to see their children I mean like Abigail for example when I was when I was here in 2007 she was just a little baby and now she's grown up and you know when when when you see somebody that are growing up and still continuing to in the Lord uh that makes you uh really joyful you know that uh and I I believe any Minister would like to see people you know being in the Lord for many years and seeing them again they growing up some of them getting married already but I still remember many faces amen uh the The Familiar Faces here I may not remember all the names but I mean I I remember all all the faces and uh again I'm very uh at home when I go to this church and sometimes I don't want to over familiarize myself but that's the way it say I mean they brother W is like a brother to me and I mean um they have ministered to the Philippines the PE the people that love them and um uh I'm just thankful that I'm here right now and of course brother John sister Alicia has he has been telling they're part of our church family in in in in the Philippines he has been there 2015 and uh I don't know if he have told you but when he went there he went there the first time by my by himself and the the company checked him in in the hotel in the shanga hotel and he was looking for for a church and he he found that there was a church just below the rooming and that was the first time I we actually it was not the first time I believe seeing him way in way back in the years when he was still in the Church of brother Earl Heist but we didn't have chance to talk but since then uh when we when he brought his family to the Philippines in the ending uh the last quarter of 2015 and every year thereafter he stayed there uh uh he stayed there for months and uh brother Samuel was saying he was surprised because I told him that brother brother John is preaching in our church and not only in our church he preaches in church of brother Danny brother Nestor and in the international Youth Camp yeah so I said maybe he's a secret preacher here secret agent Preacher Brother amen so but we were blessed in the the ministry of Brother John and um this family of course is uh I used to call his son Little John amen melmel and uh Anna so we're just we just we're just happy you know that uh they've been there so uh in in in our in our country I preach half English half Tagalog okay of course when I read the quote it's in English I explain it in Tagalog so he my my son that just do the translation for them so hoping that uh one day they will learn the whole language nobody needs to translate anymore amen so we heard this testimony and many young people were blessed by his testimony and uh when I heard that uh he was going back to Atlanta because of the work I said you know uh they know this church of course and uh and uh I I said I'll I'll be happy if you'll be in in in the Church of Samuel Deale because if I go there I can see you and uh uh everything I said I mean the prophet said God is behind every move every move so there's no accident no I believe that everything that happens is for a reason for a purpose and so now the Lord just uh uh Place us together and of course brother Louise Sister Christine yeah they have been in the Philippines amen uh it's always good to preach in a church where there's a Filipino a Filipino I mean yeah so we met I I met I met them when they were in um I think South Carolina with brother jene Williams when there was my sister sister chrisen was still there so anyway um this is I said I'm very familiar with you and you're familiar with me so I just want to just to speak out what is in my heart nothing nothing doctrinal because you have good teachers here you see when brother Wade was there I was telling yes this a teaching gift he can you know many people were blessed in the way he he he he laid down the word so uh we are thankful for that gift amen we went to the mountains we went to the coastal areas we went to the churches Church anniversaries and wherever he goes I mean the gift just manifest itself and uh it's a blessing to the people many of the things that he taught I still have in my notes so sometimes you have to expound it and I believe every five-fold Ministry has his own gift and uh I I I want I like what the prophet said that uh you have to be what God chose you to be that's right if you just try to imitate others or just a mimic and you will not be a success so that is the way God chose him to be so he's being a blessing and this the way that God chose me to be so I hope that uh we'll be blessed by the word of the Lord amen can now can we now please stand and uh I'll just read a couple of uh um scriptures as our opening text let's all bow our heads and let's uh pray to the Lord our gracious Heavenly Father we are so thankful Lord for this great privilege this great opportunity Lord that you have given us to be with the Saints here in Lula Georgia Lord believing Lord that there's there's something in it for us today we may be here for some other reason Lord but we believe Lord that you have a portion for each one of us the old ones the The Young Ones the middle age Lord you can speak to our hearts directly Lord by Your Word by the preaching of the word so I pray that you give us the action Lord give us give me the anointing as I speak your word give the anointing Lord to the hearts and the ears of my brothers and sisters that there will that there will be a a a a free flow of the spirit Lord Lord and you may have preeminence in our midst at the end of this uh message Lord we we pray that you you get all the glory and the honors for this is our prayer in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen praise the Lord amen for so for this morning I'd like to I have a little subject that I would like to speak on just speak out of my heart Brokenness in spirit Brokenness in spirit and this where I got uh this subject from the book of Psalm 51 verse uh we'll be reading let's read the couple of verse 16 and 17 he says for thou desireth not sacrifice else would I give it thou Delights in the not in the burnt offering verse 17 the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and a contrite heart oh God thou will not despise amen amen and in the book of Galatians in the New Testament this uh Paul now now speaking uh exhorting the Galatians to Bear one another's burden that if anyone would backslide he encouraged them to restore such one in the spirit of meekness you know to consider thyself that any one of us can be tempted as well so in verse three chapter 6:3 said for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing ex then he deceive it himself amen amen God bless his word uh we may now be seated amen so in the book of Jeremiah it says there that the heart is deceitful in all things now you can deceive yourself of believing that you are somebody right and people today I mean the general public the general population uh they always think that because they were able to study in college you know reach certain position acquire so many possessions in their life they they could think that they are somebody when you you when you apply for a job for example you have to to to give uh all your credentials in your resume put everything all the training that you have undergone because you have to prove to them that you are somebody right and uh I believe back in the 1970s there was this popular song popularized and it goes to say like uh Learning To Love Yourself is The Greatest Love of All it is as if that we lack loving ourself but you know we are living in the days and the times uh the in in this time of the uh that U people in the book of Timothy says people will be lovers of their own selves there's there's no scarcity of loving oneself every people love his or herself right that's why he feeds himself he he sometimes he even Abus himself for so many things because he loves himself too much right and the Bible is uh I mean that psychology will tell us oh you can love everybody but also don't forget to take care of yourself to love yourself but that's psychology know but uh in the Scriptures it says there that we should deny ourselves we should love God above all we should love our neighbors as ourselves so it's already a given right that people do you don't have to teach to let them to go to school to to teach them to love themselves people are always loving themselves right that's why when a when a baby is born when a baby is born you will notice that all their fist are clenched like this because they want everything for themselves right but when a person dies he opens his hand you cannot see a dead man with a clench fist unless he died so angry yeah right but if he's a normal man that he dies he just open his hands he said I'm nothing right he gives everything because he knows that he cannot bring anything that he has uh taken here in this life but only his character right right amen and so uh having this in mind we we we see that uh people wants to put up themselves right people people would think that they are highly uh better or should say better than other people not only in I mean we can look at politics how they fight one another uh how they they wanted to be the best right you go to the corporate side they do it go to the to the sports everybody wants to be the champion nobody wants to be the loser everybody will train hard all the rest of his life just you know just to be Champion for maybe a period of time and then the people will start forgetting them when you go to the ministry it's almost the same thing uh uh you go around so many countries and you see people because of course the five the the the prophet said there will be uh three kinds of Believers there will be people who are standing as ministers as missionaries and everything but all they want to do is to you know uh get recognition for themselves you see and that's very true that's that's very hard to to to say but it's the truth amen see uh some not not every people not every part of the fivefold ministry are really part of the fivefold ministry some they have their own personal agenda you see but we we don't condemn them we we just look at ourselves so I want to look at myself this morning uh where am I am at okay I don't want to continue serving the lord without without knowing the the motives and objectives of my heart I I believe uh uh it's brother Bram always uh tells us that uh we need to check uh if our motives and objectives are right sometime in 1964 the message is Shalom and it was it was a j January of the 1964 I believe and um he he was doing his introduction and he said uh in his prayer he said Lord help me to make my motiv and objective right amen he was telling that now this is 1964 January and about two years later he going to live the sin is you would think that this is a prophet of God and he could have been almost perfect two years before he died but he was humble enough to say Lord I want to check uh my motives and objectives I want to know if it is right in your eyes am see this is the prophet that we believe in and he he has the humility to admit that he might have a wrong objective of something he might have a wrong motive of something and you see now it it's it's it's amazing to know that many ministers today would would think that they all have the right motives and objectives but the prophet we believe in amen right he's so humble amen that even the last two years of his life he was still praying Lord make my motive and objective right in your eyes amen I think that's a lesson to us to to to think that uh every start of the year like this month of January it is always good to check ourselves and Lord do I have the right motive right the right objective in the things that I'm doing before we go forward into what we want to do for this year 2019 okay so being this uh uh I mean if we don't have a broken Spirit no God will allow things to happen in our life that we may experience some things maybe it's too hard for us but it will break our spirit and will make it make us right in the eyes of God sometime so but uh no if you if if at the start we already have this humility that we need you see um then sometimes you don't have to go through those things but I believe that every son and daughter of God will have to experience those things it's it's part of our training it's it's part of our molding the the character that needs to be molded in our in our hearts because if a person is not broken in his Spirit he will have the tendency it's it's human nature it's it's almost a human tendency that you you feel Superior to some other people right whether what whatever country you belong to whether you you you go here or you go there it's you always there's always a human tendency if you are not a Believer but you want to be superior over somebody okay once you get a hold of some position or maybe you you were recognized by by some group then there's always a tendency to be lifted up in Pride right I remember uh King Uzziah being blessed by by the Lord not because he was good but because he was obeying the Lord and you so see I I I always tell to my church salvation is unconditional we were saved by grace of God not not by our works but the blessings of the Lord this is conditional if we obey the Lord then blessings comes and if we disobey the Lord then curse comes in our life and you reap all the consequence of our wrong action uh when when we have a a youth Fellowship in our church I always tell my youth don't don't you know if you can avoid doing mistakes in your life if you have given the freedom of choice just choose always the right way because every time you choose the wrong way there's always consequence of Your Action and I was telling them as I testify I have made bad decisions in my teenage years in my early 20s that I suffered the consequence 20 years later amen you know this consequence will run after you and sometimes if we are honest enough in ourselves the reason why we are in this position because of the wrong things that we have done in the past right and and why does the Lord allows this consequence because so we can so we will start hating the sin that we have done in the past and we will not go back to that anymore and when you when you talk to the young generation you're talking out of experience it's not theology anymore but it is all knowledge I mean it's not wisdom right because you yourself have have experienced it so you not talking about another man's story but it is your own story right so when we when when we are obedient to the Lord we are blessed but sometimes if we are we are not able to handle it the right way we will look at others who cannot follow the message and little lower scale right and sometimes you force it I was telling in our parents we have a what I call the parents Fellowship where we gather all the parents and teach them about uh how to be a good parent not according again to psychology but according to what the message tells us and so I I'm telling you sometimes we many of them they drive their their children out of their house because they try to implement the you know like a tradition or what the message according to their opinion right and so instead of uh blessing their children they they drive them away because they think they're so righteous see they are so righteous that they don't make mistakes anymore but then the Lord will send a condition a situation or any circumstance that will break our spirit then at the end we will realize we are nothing see there this in John chapter 15 you can read that there that apart apart from the Lord if we he's the vine we are the branches if we abide in him we can bear much fruit and uh apart from him we cannot do anything right we cannot do anything but the opposite verse in Philippians chapter 4:3 said with I can do all things through Christen who strengthens me what how can Paul said say that because he had an experience his Spirit was broken right and maybe later little bit later we'll look at this some of the characters of The Bible which I know you are all familiar but just to emphasize a thought uh this morning that uh uh the Lord sometimes need to to break our spirit you so we can have compassion to understand other people right right right when I was a young uh Minister I was not even a pastor I when I preach in the Pulpit you know you you know when you're a young Minister brother W you just you just do this it's either you do it or you go to hell that that's that's no Grace at all no Grace at all and I and I go around I I preach so hard and then and the people instead of being blessed they they they just get condemnation right and then you know as you grow older the Lord gives you Grace and he he tells you that uh you're you're you're not as good as anybody you're you're not better than them we I'm only a it just fell on my LA to preach but I'm no better than the people I preach to okay and God will allow you know uh some Sometimes some things in our church in our own family like like sometimes your children would backl then you will realize that it's not because you're a believer that your children will be true believers right see and God allows these things he doesn't want you to have a broken family but sometimes God allows these things so you can know that we are just dependent on the Lord amen amen see you will stop demanding from others because if you are nobody you cannot go out and demand and the reason why you are demanding from somebody because you think you are somebody when in fact we are nobody right so here we realize uh like I just like to to read this particular verse in uh Luke chapter 16 now just just just to to tell you how how the Lord sees people who who who thinks so high of themselves see in Luke chapter 16 he said he was talking to the to the to the Pharisees he said and he said unto them ye are they which just Jus ify yourselves before men but God knows your heart for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God if you esteem so highly for yourself among men I mean it's like in Modern English you will say I'm better than you than others and for for God that is an Abomination and if you look at the word Abomination it's it's it's it's it looks like a not not so hard word right but it's an abomination then so there I I heard from an old preacher before how describes abomination in in in the modern days it's like he said um uh in the times of the The Exodus the the Israelites will go out to the Wilderness you know they don't have toilets during that time they will they get their Spades and dig a hole and do their toilet jutties there and then they have to cover it because if they will not cover it it will be an abomination right so in modern translate that to modern language it is an an flash toilet that is an Abomination see un flash toilet right so if we think of ourselves High higher than the others we are like un flash toilets in the sight of the Lord that's how he describes it right it's an abomination in the sight of the Lord in in other words whatever we do our righteousness it's just like rubbish in the eyes of the Lord of course we accomplish something by the grace of God and God is honored then God will give us a reward God is a rewarding God right but we cannot boast of what we want uh we can we can uh uh do in the sight of God I have a couple of uh uh quotations here if we can put it on the board uh this is from the message gyus a secret believer 1955 it's about being self centered uh it says here I I have taught much this brother BR I'm speaking now I have he is going on missionary trips he said he have taught the hens in Africa in India in many different parts of the world but the worst unbelievers you deal with is not the man who has never heard right you would think that the worst sinner would be the man that you know the unbelievers but they said it's the man who is self centered in his own way and won't hid to God that's the worst sinner because if you're are so self-centered a person is so self-centered see you will not hi correction right you will not need nobody to teach you he said that's the worst kind to deal with for they seem to be just so centered that nothing can move them don't talk to me I don't believe it right so that that's a worst kind of person if you are self-centered in another message he was talking about King Uzziah in the message influence preached in 1962 he said uh they got lifted up self-willed self-centered Pride that you can't tell nothing to God can uh uh God can't find a way to get into their hearts it's because they become so know it all you know it's it's hard to talk to a person that he knows everything yeah he just wants to talk and if you talk he doesn't care he doesn't want to listen and I have and I've met many people you know that uh when you start talking to them they will not listen and they just want to talk and talk and talk and you listen and listen listen see he's not interested in what you have to say he's interested in what he has or she has to say see these are self centered people and and and and the and the prophet said that this is not a nice attitude for a person right because I I don't know about you but uh you want to be with people that you know you can you can talk and you can listen to them also that's good Fellowship because if only one is talking then that's not Fellowship that's just like listening to a a news reporter recording right so we want we want discussion we want Fellowship we want to talk to one another right exort one another and so um if you a person who is self- centered he he Al he always wants to talk about himself right now the Lord allowed I said events in the life of the people before actually he uses you he wants to to to do something in your in your in your life life and when when we come to to this kind of a subject the first first people in the in the Bible that comes to our mind is like Moses job Peter and Paul and these people before God have used them mightily God has to break their Spirit see we know we all know that Moses he he was he was predestined to be the deliverer of Egypt oh I mean of of of the Israelites in the land of Egypt and I I believe that when he was growing up her mother joshed was already rehearsing to him that you were like this this is your testimony this is how the Lord protected you and so while Moses was learning from the from the great educational system of the Egyptians and the the prophet said he was he was trained in the great military uh traditions of Egypt but in the midst of all those training and exposure here is a little Nanny but actually her his mother telling him that you have a purpose you a reason now while he was growing up until he reached the age of 40 and I believe that uh maybe it has gone into the head of Moses and said oh I'm the deliver I'm the great man Moses that that the Lord will use to deliver his people and the prophet said well while the Pharaoh was looking at the window he saw a bunch of slaves but Moses had the vision he saw a bunch of not the slaves but these are children of God that needs to be delivered so he had the right Vision he had the right exposure he the right training God that V deicated his life but you know he's still the man Moses and sometimes if you you know so many things uh it become it gets into your head and you you just realize when you face the mirror your head is getting bigger and bigger every day right yeah yeah sometimes you can but people doesn't notice they they will notice their their stomach getting big right but you will not notice your head getting big because it's a little bit spiritual you know so but by the way you talk the way you you move the way you see people the way you see people that will speak what is in your heart right and so here is Moses one day he just uh uh killed an Egyptian right because he maybe he said I I'll put everything I will start my Ministry now all right I will start what God has called me to do but you know he got afraid why because the anointing was not there he was trained but the anointing was not there and fast forward 40 years later we know what happened he was brought into the Wilderness under his father-in law the medanite Jetro you know God needed 40 years uh for Moses to be under the supervision is of father-in-law right so it can be broken and I was amazed brother W you know because in the Philippines some of the some of the people there will be with their mother-in-law or father-in-law for one year and they'll be totally broken just one yeah but Moses need to be with his father-in-law for 40 years amen see to to strip away everything that he learned not actually strip away because the leadership principles that he he he learned he used it but this time God is now you know directing his ways right amen sometimes your profession that the Lord has called you to be he will use it in the ministry that he will give you I have this kind of background in my own life and uh um I I didn't go too far from it I mean what the Lord has allowed me to be in my younger years God is using it in my ministry right right uh I I I was trained in the Philippines to be in uh to be in the Philippine Army in the ranger to be in this in this Guerilla Warfare to be in the mountains in the jungles but I never became uh I mean I left the military at a very young age so everything I learned I was not able to use it but many years later I went to the mission field the jungles the mountains not not not carrying a gun you or a comp a combat backpack but a Bible but you know the training is the same right but they they told me how you know how you adopt in different cultures when you go to a a certain location you have to to know their culture you know to to adapt yourself and all those principles were used not in the battlefield but in the mission field so I said nothing nothing was wasted right our experiences in the past our training in the past how the Lord used us uh I mean when the Lord uses us it will be all be used right like for example if you're a teacher in a school God will use that gift of teaching maybe in the church in a Sunday School in as a Ministry all these things God will use it because he knows where the the position that you need to be at a certain time at a certain point in your life so God allows this but he needs to break like Moses he broke Moses right that's why if we read in the book of Exodus chapter 3 when he was already being called by the Lord uh uh just just a portion of this word he said in in chapter 3 verse 10 he said come now therefore I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou may bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt and Mos said unto them God who am I that I should go now this is a broken Moses 40 years later he was say oh Lord I can do it with my close eyes yeah uh uh but but now but now here is Moses he said who am I how can I do this is 40 years later is already a nobody yeah he was already broken right but the Lord said now I can use you now I can use you before I cannot use you but now I can use you I became a Believer when I was 30 years old I started preaching when I was 33 years old but in the first 3 years of uh being a Believer God break me in so many ways that I didn't know why the reason I cannot explain but looking back I said I needed all those experience otherwise I will not be able to fulfill the ministry that he has usted me you know at the end of the at the end of the day when I finish my Tour of Duty I'll just stop I I don't believe that any ministry will be will going up and going up you know and be you will become popular until the Lord comes because the Bible said he must increase and we must decrease if in my Ministry I will decrease and be become recognized by so many people then I fail because I I fail to increase Jesus Christ and increase in said I increaseed myself so we must decrease so if they will say oh you you're not the they don't know you anymore it doesn't matter right you know there was in in sometime uh in the 1950s I believe brother Bram was was spoking is speaking about the present stage of his ministry and he mentioned about deas deas with Paul Paul said deas has forsaken has has forsaken me and it's for me it's so um uh you would say that it is Supernatural that uh Paul as a deas brother bam as a deas shakarian in his stage also and they both do they did both the same thing they they they forsaken the prophet you know and so here's Deus he said you know Deus forsook Paul but de but brother bam said I don't believe that deas went off to nightclub's box lead no he didn't do that he said he he was a he was a he a fine cultured man the prophet said he was smart he was intellectual he was a Spirit-filled man the prophet said but then when he saw that there's see seemingly a falling in the ministry of Paul because he was in prison this great uh Apostle Paul that can strike you blind he said now he's in the prison and he has only one coat and he said oh bring bring tell Timothy to bring my one coat and bring my old you know my dog my my my Scrolls and everything he doesn't have anything in himself so here is here is De here is here is deas he said oh maybe Paul is his ministry is over yeah see because the the the mindset of deas about the ministry you will just get popular and popular and Higher and Higher and Higher see and if you have that kind of thinking then once the ministry starts to L lay La see you will say Oh Brother Sam is finished no it's not finished because after we have done what we need to do I believe the Lord will increase and we have to decrease people will not have to talk about us anymore see if I go to for example and they will be talking about me then I failed but if they will be talking about the message that I preach then I have succeeded see as I was telling them one day you will forget me you will forget these people that the Lord has used maybe you will still respect them but you know new ministry will come up if the Lord will T right and this new ministry will come up the young ministers anointed preachers see it's not a competition anyways see we just want to do what we want to do amen see and that's the way it has to go I mean God has to has to break us so when he uses us all the glory goes to God now we we we see in the Book of Job if we if we if we open in the in the Book of Job in the first chapter this is the the the testimony or or or the statement to hear about job he said there was a man in the land of who whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and stood evil and they were born unto him seven sons and three daughters good family right his substance also was 7,000 sheep uh 3,000 camels 500 yoke of oxen 500 and all all this this this uh the belongings that he has and he said he was the greatest of all men of the East y nothing said about being humble no see but he was perfect and upright he stood evil he was great in the eyes of men see but the Lord needs to break job this is an example for all of us so in the next few chapters God was breaking job all right in fact it came to a point that job was already questioning right the Lord Lord I did not do something bad why is this happening to me and they have best friends that instead of encouraging him maybe you're a secret sinner see you know see when we do something when we do something and the people they when when you are in your high people you they they they praise you but when you are in your low people say oh maybe you've done something wrong right it's always that way even even coming from uh Believers themselves right that's why he in in one of the messages said the uh the prophet said look at job a perfect man a just man and God permitted the evil devil to come upon him and chastise him and everything else for the perfecting of his spirit amen God want I mean here in the vers that we read you already he was already perfect he was upright he's stood evil but but but the Lord said he he but but the prophet said he allowed everything else to happen to perfect his spirit amen you know the Lord is still in the in the business of perfecting all of us amen amen until it's it's not finished until it's finished see until we hit the the the Rock Bottom then that's the only time that we can be perfected in in our spirit and so God uses evil spirit many times to work out his plan and his will so of course we know that the evil spirit cannot cannot do anything in our life unless God allows him he's just he's just a tool in God's hand it's not even it's not even somebody that we we we should be afraid of you know and now uh 40 or 39 chapters later now this is the the the confession of job now after all the things that happen in his life he said in chapter 40 said moreover the Lord answered job and and said shall he that contend with the almighty instruct him he that reproveth God let him answer then job answered the Lord and said behold I am vile now the word vile means insignificant he would not have told that in chapter one because he was the greatest how can you say that I'm insignificant you know that you are great in the eyes of many people and you know that you're doing good you pray for your children you you intercede for them right you preach may maybe he's a preacher in his time he has all the possessions he doesn't need the help of other people see you know I was wondering before when I came into into the message and was doing Mission Works I said why would the Lord not bless the Philippines in as much as the United States or Europe European countries where they have the the the purchase power of the dollar is more powerful than the pesos right it was a puzzle to me because I always say that you are you are uh serving the same God that we are serving amen so if God can bless you here maybe God can bless us there but you know as I grow older I realize that God makes other countries poor other countries Rich so they can interact with each other so they will depend on one another so the rich will have the compassion to help the poor the poor will have the humility to ask from the rich right it's not I I I I have my own or I I will say in our church we do Mission work works with have our own funds and that makes you somebody greater you you you think you're you don't need anybody but because the Lord make us different right yes sir and so God will use everybody to help everybody amen you can preach in our church I can preach in here brothers from Jamaica can go here and preach we can you can go preach to the India and the cambodians when they received the message they went to us and came preach for us and then you see that's the the way the gift is going F Ministry perfecting the Saints doing their different ways but the thing is we depend on one another we cannot live alone as as as the ad says no man is an island and I said no church should isolate himself and don't have fellowship with other churches amen right so we we're just thankful for the open Fellowship that we have and so here's Moses and here's job and everything was stripped in their in what they have right and so we go to the Old Testament to the New Testament the same thing happened to the apostles right it it's the very same thing you know Peter like Peter was uh was with the Lord for three and a half years right he was he was doing he was like the leader of the Apostles he was the oldest I believe in the among the apostles and and the Lord called him personally from from being a fisherman he was not just an ordinary fisherman I think he was he was a he was an expert fisherman that he is he he was fishing all his life his father and mother might be fishermen also so he knows everything but one day God called him and God told him from this time on you will not be fishermen but a Fishers of Men In other words from a from a secular job to a right Ministry a sacred position he has to leave everything not all of us are called to leave our former job right but there will be people who will be called to leave your job and go to the ministry right and you know sacrifice everything and you know go to the to I would say the the Narrow Path the the the The Road Less travel I was called when I was 30 I I I mean 33 uh uh to to be in the ministry I have a I would say a promising career in in in the field that I chose but uh but the Lord was calling me and you know when the Lord calls you you have to to to to let it go and it it took me a while to really Let It Go I mean I already quit from my secular job but in my heart I'm still in my job right that's why when I was 40 and I became I became a pastor uh I went back to my former job and worked and you know things are not are not that the same anymore I thought I I thought I I would do good in my career but uh I realized that it was it was not my skills it was not it it was only by the grace of God and this thing happened to Peter you know and uh he he was there he was uh he was uh serving the lord he was he we would say in our modern times he went full-time in serving the lord right and in in um in Luke uh chapter 22 let me just uh read this he said Luke chapter 22 uh verse 31 he said and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan that desired to have you that he may sift you a sweep so the devil is not happy amen Satan is not happy when we are doing what we are to do right but but he said this the Lord Jesus saying but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren so he was in the ministry but he was not yet converted right he was not yet converted but he said when you are converted strengthen your brethren and you know Peter with this kind of attitude he always had this attitude that he is better than the others and said he said to the Lord Lord I am ready to go with thee both into prison into that and we know that's that's a lie yeah it it is not true he he he he he you know he speaks faster than what he thinks right yeah see and he said I tell thee Peter the shall not grow this day before thou shallal tries deny that thou knowest me and we we know that happened right he denied the Lord three times uh and so this is this is Peter see so it was the breaking time of Peter right now he realized later after he denied the Lord Jesus Christ that he's not good after all what he said that he will be with the Lord in prison or in death it's not true because he denied he he denied the Lord right so if you look on the next because you know these gospels they see the different angles right and here is John seeing how Peter after he was broken in his Spirit right now this is another Peter this is another Peter uh a different attitude of Peter now this is in John the last chapter of John uh Book of John is in 21 he said after these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of tiberias and the wise show themselves and so they Simon Peter was there and said in verse three Simon Peter said unto them I go of fishing and you will tell I thought the Lord already called you out of fishing but here is Peter he wanted to go back to his profession he loves so fishing so much right that he will quit the ministry and go back to fishing and you know why he quit the ministry because he said I failed my Lord then he realized now that I thought I was the great Apostle Peter but he was not he said maybe if he would TR to dramatize it a little bit but Peter would said I thought I loved the Lord I served the Lord but now I denied him so I don't have any face you know to to to face him anymore so maybe just maybe I'll just go back to what I'm good at right he cannot go to farming he doesn't know farming he cannot be an uh an IT expert because there was no computer during that time so he went back to fishing the the profession he thought he was good at and God has to teach him another lesson amen right so when he go fishing was there overnight and they found no fish I mean a veteran Fisher would know what is the right time to go to the Sea and where is the right place where the seas are we have Pastors in the Philippines who are good in fishing and when they just go out to the the middle of the sea they go back with all you know many fish because they're expert on it right and I can go to the middle of the sea and I can I I I'll be lost yeah because I I I am a city boy I don't I don't belong to the in the I don't know farming I don't know fishing I don't I know how to eat fish but I don't know how fishing see but uh but uh but this but this Peter you know he knows everything about fishing right but God showed him you are not a good Fisher yeah you think you are but you are not and now here is is Peter you know toiling all night and finding no fish and then the Lord shows himself am and said throw it to the right side right right and he throw it to the right side he found fish so all the while think Peter was thinking I'm a good Fisher but it was not him who's good it was the Lord who because it was his training right he it was his training because later in the years in your life he'll be fishing men yes amen right so the same principle that he's using throwing the net to the fish is the same principle that he will throw the gospel net to the people but this time is not fishes anymore it's souls for the glory of the Lord so he he didn't went much away you know from from from the from his calling and so we we we we see the next uh event that happened you know um the Lord was asking him Peter do you love me right and you know the translation Peter do you agapo me right it's it's the highest form of love and Peter would answer Lord I just filo you right I mean Peter could not say Lord I love you I will go with you until your dead because he knows he failed the Lord already he was broken already so he was humble Lord I I love you just a little bit not too much three times he has denied three times the Lord asked him and after three times he said this is not the same Peter said Lord I really cannot reach that level of love for you yeah and the Lord said no we can start from where you are that's Grace that's Grace right whatever we have just give it to the Lord then we can start on that small thing amen see but this is not the same Peter that oh Lord my other fellow disciples may not love you the way I love you but no he said Lord because he knows already failed he was already broken in spirit but this time you know you know the rest of the story he was used mightily by the Lord he was not when he was crucified he wanted himself crucified upside down because he he felt that he not it's not uh fitting for him to Die the way the Lord died yeah think about a broken Spirit he had a broken Spirit right and many years later I mean uh after the Lord uh left the sin there's another Apostle by the name of Paul and we know his testimony how how uh he was riding uh uh uh on on their way going to to the journey going to Damascus and just just take note of of the words of Paul here in chapter nine of the book of a said and so yet breathing out of out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest and decided of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he uh that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem so it's it was like Paul he was still he was still marveling how how he killed you know Stephen and all the Christians and and maybe he was telling oh did you see how how he slash these people and I ordered the killing of them he was too proudful you that uh he was he was marveling as in h his accomplishment and he went to the high priest and said okay give me the permit I will kill them all right that that that's Paul I mean Saul right he he was not yet converted during the time and as he Jour the Bible said he came near Damascus this is the point that will be you know broken by the Lord right amen and you see there was a light that s suddenly shined and and he said in the verse for he fell to the Earth yes am you know the Earth he fell to the dust amen from dust Thou Art to dust thou return you know a person who is in the dust can never fall right how can you fall deeper than the dust right unless you dig a ground then you you sink yourself in that hole but uh uh that means Paul was from from from somebody became a nobody right amen he was in the dust of the Earth right he was there see and he got blind he was strip from the things that he thought he had right he was the Pharisee of the Pharisees was very intelligent he was an intellectual uh intellectual preacher and and the prophet spoke many times about uh having the the what you call the intellectual conception against the spiritual Revelation and you can click that in the computer and you said it's just a mental conception it's just a mental conception these are all intellectual conception we can have the message intellectually amen this explains why why many ministers even Ministers of message Believers been in the message for many many many years then suddenly just a click of a finger they will leave the message not only leave the message but will forsake the message go against the message and leave and and you will see if they they you look at their life they go back to the world right they don't remain to be a Christian they would say that they're a Christian but the way they look I I've seen that in different countries I've seen that in our country that if they start leaving the message the first thing the women will do they will cut their hair they'll put earrings the first thing the men will do they will put tattoos in their their it is as if they were doing this for many years right but it was not in their heart because it was only intellectual conception see so as I always say this is a marathon race right this is not a Sprint see the the the journey that we are at we have to finish until the end and you know when you are when you are when you when you run a marathon Race you do not start fast you do not start strong you just keep on pacing and pacing until but when the last about 200 meters away you dash to the Finish Line that's the way we do it amen but you can see a believer that so is strong at first you will see after a few years he will leave the message it's like you're just cranking a car then after one mile no more gas right it's like that it's always like that wherever I go no matter what culture you belong to it's always the same see it's always the same you know God's uh principles are Universal see so God has to strip all these things from Moses from job from Peter from Paul because God will use them and God cannot use us to the to the fullest until we are stripped from every uh um thinking being self-centered that we have because you will just you know you will just be puffed up no I I I was telling when I was in Cloverdale uh because I work with them for 10 years you know I was doing all the reports Mission work reports I when when funds are coming in I will I will always the same thing as I'm doing here with brother Samuel I will account the the funds to the to the last scent AB so if it's 4 5 cents or 05 cents I will put it in the record and I it's there because I want to be a good Steward not to the people but to the Lord because I will know I will be answerable for that and I have to report all these things what happened and everything to to to to them and um for 10 years I've been doing that but I told them any one of you here remember the report I did in their pulpit in June 16 2000 year 2002 nobody Remembered at the end of the day it will just be statistic right oh I went there I baptized 100 I baptized you can baptize the whole world right see but it's just statistics y right it's just statistics sometimes if you are not careful you will say oh I'm better than them I'm better than this missionary it's it's nonsense amen see because if God will not allow us to do Mission Works we're nothing see we can go out in the field try to accomplish so many things you know before when we do Mission Works there's no camera just you just make it but now everywhere you can just with your cell phone do things and and make it appear make it appear that it was so hard for you you're eating Stone you're eating grass yeah but it's not true it's not true right right oh I I ate this I ate that I stayed there I stayed there it has no score when you go to heaven there's no score no it's it's in the motive of the heart we are looking for the last predestinated seed that's what end time evangelism is all about look for the last but the prophet said what is end time evangelism end time evangelism is looking for the last predestinated seed so it's not for everybody and shaping the stone he said stone is your confession and but a but but a stone needs a a a a a Mason Stone Mason to shape that means we can go out of missions to look for the last predestinated seed or to look for this message believers who are not yet really matured enough so you use the gift of teaching to mature the people but the end of the day it is not our accomplishment that's right it's not our accomplishment see they will forget all about you y yeah see but as long as they remember what you have preached to them then you have mission accomplished right amen okay many years ago I was in Germany I was invited there to preach in in in a certain church and they said go to this church we have an Outreach 200 um 200 miles away from the the main church so I went there it was a house Church they welcome me you know the the German the German bride is the same as the US bride they're still they still have the southern hospitality there I don't know why but but they're very Hospital they're very good right and I preached to them and they and you know the the minister was holding that group he said brother Vernon you we were blessed in the way you preach the message you delivered and everything we will never forget you he said then that was 2008 201 I was able to go back to to Germany and I went I was there and the pastor go back to the to the same place because uh they they they're waiting for went there and the pastor the the the minister said oh brother Vernon is this the first time you went here he was telling me that he will never forget me for 24 hours but after two years he forgot everything about it so sometimes you know you I do not get flattered when people say oh we were blessed because I know it's that that's just Simple Kindness that's just respect but if you ask what did I preach well I I really did didn't understand what you said yeah and so we want to be a blessing to people but we want we don't want to put any accomplishment in our head reporting is good Mission reporting I I do Mission reports in our church because I want them to know what the Lord is doing but I it's not my intention to tell them this is your pastor this is what I do right no why because I said it's it's just statistics yes if if I baptize 100 souls and this brother baptize One Soul it doesn't matter right you did the same thing in front of the Lord see so sometimes you feel inferior because your church is small you feel inferior because your ministry is not that big but in the eyes of the Lord if you if if you became faithful to what the Lord has called you to be and I believe I believe that when you face the Lord it will just be the same right we will have our rewards for what we have done for the lord it's not just like the simple parable of the talents the Lord will not ask what he has not given to you right see so what the Lord has gave has placed in my hands I want to be faithful right I will not compare it with the with the accomplishment of other people I will not go you know this what we done this what we've done of course I need to to tell it to you to share it to you because brother samel has been engaged in the mission work in the Philippines but that is just for information purposes it has nothing to do with what I have done God could have used another person God could have used uh a brother or or a sister there that not not me but the works of the Lord will still continue why because the the right motives right so but if we think that we are better than the others then we start you know that's why even in the testimony I tell my church when you testify in front when you testify make sure that you are giving glory to the Lord that's right don't testify as if you're better than the other that's right okay that's not testimony that's putting up yourself and I said to the ministers when they go out you you make your mission report you make a mission report in such a way that the people will be blessed because of what the Lord is doing in the mission field not what you're doing not what you're are accomplishing not what you have preached you don't go to to the in front and say oh the I went there and the people were so blessed that they want don't want me to go home yeah it's all about you it's all about you right so sometimes these are little things but sometimes these little things you know you you you with so we have to look at these little things it's not so deep but you know when the Rapture comes he will be perfected right and even these little things will not be left that's right right I mean we we have to correct these little things and so uh as as I close let me open this in uh in the in the book of second Timothy in in the book of 2 Timothy Chapter 2 it says here you know how Paul is a typologist he he he always uh types the the subject that's preaching to whatever he is in the in his environment so he said in verse three he said thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that WTH ENT tangl at himself with the Affairs of this life in other words if you put it in modern language if you are if you are in the m military don't be don't entangle yourself with the civilian Affairs the civilian Affairs and so when I was 17 years old I entered the military academy similar as your you United States Military Academy here in the West Point um I went there a 17year old graduate fresh graduate from high school I I went there and it was we we call it a reception day they will this this upper class cadetes will receive you and of course you are wearing your all your civilian clothes and the first thing you do you you line up in front of them and they start you know grabbing your shirt you know um wasting your shirt and everything and they will strip you from all your civilian clothes your socks even your underwear then they will they they will first put you in like a uh uh physical training push-ups and everything P craw there craw there and then they will let you remove and they will not remove you slowly but they will rip it away from you it was like a ritual because from that day on you will not be wearing civilian clothes anymore everything that you will wear are all the part of the uniform of the Armed Forces of the Philippines now there's I didn't understand it during that time but later on I understand that they're trying to give us a mindset that from that time on we will be in the military we don't have anything to do with the civilian Affairs right that everything we do we have the same color of underwear we have the same uh of course different sizes but you know you you you wear the same thing everywhere so there's no fashion see if you wear all the same all of you wearing white there's no fashion if all of us will the same the same coat I wouldn't say your coat is better than mine because it's all the same so what the military is trying to tell us to train us to is that there is equality Among Us right we are not uh we are not to be in the Affairs of the C life anymore then I became a Believer I read this I said this is the same thing that Paul is saying see when we are called to be the soldier of the of Jesus Christ we will be stripped away from anything that we know that is good for us and God will give us something not not our righteousness but his robe of righteousness no no longer our righteousness because it it looks like filthy rugs in the Lord in the in the eyes of the Lord but he will he will cloth us with his righteousness meaning everything that we will from that time on any accomplishment that we will make any if we will be a Channel of blessing to other because the lord always bless us so we can be a blessing right and so if we can whe we can be a blessing to others it's because God blessed us first it's not because we are good people it's not because uh we are better than the others and if we think that we are better that then God will break us until ouro spirit is broken and we can say lord it's not me it's all about you it's all about you see anything that we will do hence forth from this time we will think no Lord this is just a privilege for me even I tell my church as a pastor it's just a privilege I know one day if I get old if the Lord will will T and I will I will still be here and I cannot preach anymore I have to give up I have to give it to somebody else but until then the Lord wants to use me and keeps me that's why the Lord will will always give something to us to keep us humble in our way yeah when he say we are Sons and Daughters of God and so he he sees you going astray what will he do we'll do something that will humble you always humble us but if you're not humble enough you will look at the child why is the son of this brother why is the sister of this brother why is the wife why is the husband like this see you have no compassion you want to convict everybody that is not according to your standard right see but then I learned later in in the later years of my life as a message believer it's not about our standard it's not even our standard we don't have standards if I will look at my standard my standard is far far below the standard of the Lord see but but the Lord will allow us to fall to fail to be defeated to be disappointed to be this illution okay so when that time comes that you you need to have compassion for others who cannot obey the message the way they should be we will have compassion to them see we will have compassion to them and who knows maybe the Lord will open their eyes you know and you'll be the tool for them to be matured in the message but until we really get humble in our stuff you will never see it I was telling my son my second son is very close to Brother John he sometimes because maybe of his b he's an intelligent boy he when he was in grade one uh he he was transferring school and uh sister Anna the the administrator gave her an entrance exam for grade six but it was just grade one wow but he he the the the administrator didn't know and he didn't know and he just answered everything he got it perfect an entrance exam so that's how intelligent he is see so sometimes intelligent people are good but you know when they grow up they they believe that they're then then it came to a point in her life that he is a know it all so God has to break him in so many ways so he applied to this job he he didn't find favor in the in the in the in in the eyes of the the superiors he went to this job he didn't find favor and he said he got disappointed he said Papa uh why is it like this he said I'm praying and uh you know the I'm working for companies that I cannot find favor from my superiors and I said I think the Lord is breaking your spirit yeah I think the Lord is telling you something I think the Lord is telling you to be humble enough you know don't don't don't trust in your in your own skills in your intelligence just leave it to the Lord see and you know I mean he learns it his lessons and uh he try he he humbles himself he humbled himself you know to to to to see what the Lord wants him to do I think every child of God will be like that Glory no matter how old you are what culture you belong to what what country you belong to as the as as long as the Lord wants to call you and to give you something he will give you this kind of experience and it's for our own good anyway and at the end of the day we can say Lord thank you for breaking my spirit amen and I hope that uh the Lord will help us I don't know what the Lord needs to be to be broken in our lives but he knows he knows he knows it sometimes even in the last portion of our life we will have to have this uh breaking right as I told you in a while ago brother Bram was already two years before he died he still he he he still wanted the Lord to correct his motives and objectives how much more us amen we don't know when we will die or when the Lord will come but that will be my prayer for this January Lord if you can see anything in my heart any motives any intentions and objectives that's not right with you yes will you correct it for me right I will not wait for the time that he was to put me in this kind of situation that my spirit will be broken I will cry right see don't don't don't why why will you walk near the edge if you can walk in the middle right it's much safer it's much always much safer so can we close our eyes for a while and uh let's just pray to the Lord as I before I bring it back to our pastor our gracious Heavenly Father Lord your message is a message of restoration your message is a message of Grace it is a message that will lead us to our rightful position to be adopted as your sons and daughters and Lord having this message in our life means more than anything to us but Lord this message is not just for deep doctrines this message is not just to give us an intellectual conception Lord but uh this message is for us to have a spiritual Revelation to know who we are in your sight to know which part of the body we belong to and Lord we pray and I pray Lord for our my brothers and my sisters here whom I considered as a a family for me and I pray that you will bless each one of us including myself Lord that you will give us a humble heart a humble enough Lord to accept our mistakes that if they will have any any accomplishment in our life we will always give the glory to you we will speak it to other people in such a way not to to raise up ourself Lord but in such a way that we will just be showing them how you work in our life it's all about you Lord you you must increase in our life and we must decrease but we need your help Father God we need your grace to Humble ourselves thank you Lord for those instances for those times that you have broken our spirit because we believe Lord that we
