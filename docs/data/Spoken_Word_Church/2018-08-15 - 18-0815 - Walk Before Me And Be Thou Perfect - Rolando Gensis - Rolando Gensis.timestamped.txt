[3:19] and we have my the church in Kalbach
[3:26] City Philippines I bring greetings in
[3:29] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let us
[3:33] open our Bible in the book of Genesis
[3:35] chapter 17
[3:39] let us read just one verse and verse 1
[3:46] it says and when Abraham Abraham was
[3:51] ninety years old and nine the Lord
[3:54] appeared to Abram and said unto him I am
[3:57] the Almighty God walk before me and be
[4:00] thou perfect let us bow our heads there
[4:05] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord God
[4:08] for this opportunity that we can hear
[4:10] your word of eternal life Lord as we are
[4:15] going to talk about your word I pray
[4:18] that the Holy Spirit will come and
[4:21] anoint your word also I pray that you
[4:25] will use your humble servant Alleluia
[4:29] and
[4:30] you will hide me behind you and father
[4:35] God you do the the speaking Lord God
[4:38] circumcise my lips and my mind and my
[4:41] heart Alleluia and may the words that we
[4:46] are going to talk tonight Lord God will
[4:49] be a blessing to everyone Lord bless a
[4:51] bridge in the name of Jesus Christ we
[4:55] pray amen you may be seated in the
[4:59] presence of the Lord
[5:03] Alleluia and I just want to talk about
[5:10] but just just simple things Alleluia and
[5:15] about the subject in the text that we
[5:19] read hallelujah
[5:21] walk before me and be thou perfect walk
[5:26] before me and be thou perfect or
[5:28] perfection by walking with God Alleluia
[5:33] now when we talk about perfection or the
[5:40] word perfect I know you you know it you
[5:47] understand it but for me hallelujah
[5:51] I always although I understand this word
[5:56] but I always go to dictionary what you
[6:00] know the some of the meaning Alleluia
[6:05] and it says ah perfect
[6:10] the meaning is having no mistakes or
[6:12] flaws completely correct or accurate but
[6:18] the third one is the one that I like is
[6:21] having all the qualities you want in
[6:23] that kind of person situation etc
[6:28] perfect Alleluia you have all the
[6:33] qualities you want in that kind of
[6:35] person or situation or a thing or
[6:39] Alleluia et cetera
[6:43] just like I know that I believe there
[6:47] are some of you here that know some
[6:50] woodworking there are some woodworkers
[6:53] that when they are making some projects
[6:58] that some of them are they're looking
[7:01] for the piece of wood that had some nuts
[7:05] and some defect on it hallelujah and for
[7:10] others maybe windy windy so what he is
[7:13] doing with the carpenter what what the
[7:16] carpenter is doing maybe other people
[7:18] will say oh that's a damaged hood or
[7:21] reject but for the carpenter who who has
[7:25] done there be division who as was the
[7:28] plan hallelujah what he is trying to
[7:31] make Alleluia what what is trying to
[7:33] portray in his mind for him although it
[7:37] is defective but for him it is the
[7:40] perfect one alia that he is looking
[7:44] hallelujah
[7:46] just like God when our government is
[7:53] recruiting young young ones for for
[7:57] soldiers Alleluia and in recruiting
[8:02] soldiers there are some qualifications
[8:06] to be met
[8:08] Alleluia and you need to perfectly fit
[8:12] for that qualification Alleluia because
[8:15] if you are not perfectly fit for that
[8:19] qualification you will not be accepted
[8:21] but it doesn't mean that when you are
[8:24] accepted that you know already
[8:26] the military tactics Alleluia
[8:29] you are perfect for that qualification
[8:32] but the government has to train you
[8:35] hallelujah
[8:37] we'll teach you will will shape you
[8:39] hallelujah
[8:41] in order for you to be a full-fledged
[8:43] soldier Alleluia now here in Genesis
[8:50] chapter 17 the text that we read
[8:53] hallelujah and Abraham
[8:56] called the father of faith father of
[9:00] faith
[9:01] it means he's our model he's our you
[9:08] know Alleluia a father of faith yet when
[9:14] we look on his life
[9:16] Alleluia there's a lot of yes a lot of
[9:20] mistakes
[9:22] Alleluia Flo's failures and even he
[9:27] don't be God although Paul said that
[9:32] after the dot after the blood of Jesus
[9:35] Christ was poured in in in Calvary
[9:38] Alleluia and God didn't see the mistakes
[9:42] of Abraham
[9:44] hallelujah win win God said about
[9:48] Abraham and he is pulled to write about
[9:51] what he saw Abraham God said and he
[9:56] started not at the promise of God
[9:58] through unbelief but was he was strong
[10:01] in faith hallelujah
[10:03] but brothers and sisters he got a lot of
[10:08] Alleluia failures hallelujah one time
[10:13] bar Burnham saying God would have could
[10:19] have killed Sarah at that moment when
[10:22] Sarah loved and doubted God Alleluia but
[10:28] for me it is a right for her to love
[10:30] because she was not the mother of faith
[10:33] Alleluia she was not the mother of faith
[10:38] but Abraham himself being the father of
[10:42] faith and he not the god oh my Alleluia
[10:50] you know if you if you read verses 15 to
[10:56] 18 after God said to Abraham Abraham
[11:01] walk with me
[11:03] Alleluia and build out perfect Alleluia
[11:06] and then verse 15
[11:09] God said and God said unto Abraham as
[11:13] for Sarai thy wife thou shalt not call
[11:16] her name Sarai but Sarah shall her name
[11:20] be and I will bless her and give thee a
[11:25] son also of her now Abraham you have
[11:29] already a son through Hagar but this
[11:33] time I will also give a son hallelujah
[11:37] through Sarah yay I will bless her and
[11:41] she shall be a mother of Nations Kings
[11:44] people shall be of her you know what
[11:49] Abraham answered God hallelujah when the
[11:52] answer to God he said then Abraham fell
[11:55] at his face and laugh Alleluia and said
[12:01] unto his heart shall a child be born
[12:04] unto him that is an hundred years old
[12:07] angel Sarah that is 90 years old bear
[12:12] would it be possible for a hundred years
[12:16] old
[12:16] for me hundred years old in Sarah ninety
[12:20] years old and when Sarah loved also he
[12:23] said can I have a son with my lord
[12:31] Abraham hidden her pleasure Olivia with
[12:36] the with the with the things that are
[12:42] what because I'm sorry
[12:46] Alleluia with the normal couple though
[12:51] Alleluia can can we have a son
[12:54] Alleluia so also Abraham did what Sarah
[12:58] did Alleluia and not only this he goes
[13:01] and says and Abraham said unto God all
[13:04] that Ishmael might live before thee
[13:07] hallelujah you know God Lord
[13:15] it seems the thing that you are talking
[13:18] about is impossible maybe
[13:21] you mean is mine Alleluia but the Lord
[13:25] said through Sara
[13:27] so it seems Ibrahim was doubting and not
[13:35] only sis but he he was really doubting
[13:37] Olivia what the Lord was saying you know
[13:42] in chapter 8 the 18 Elohim appeared to
[13:48] him in the plain of Mamre Alleluia and
[13:51] after that in verse in verse 20 dig up
[13:56] the body change and Bourbon hammy
[14:01] dramatized this data while Abraham and
[14:04] Sarah were walking down to gr and
[14:08] win-win Abraham looked upon Sarah and
[14:13] Sarah was Oh Sarah it seems you are
[14:16] getting beautiful I remember the first
[14:19] time I when we when we first get married
[14:23] Alleluia and Sarah said oh you're also
[14:26] getting handsome getting a young man
[14:31] hallelujah then then Abraham's in
[14:34] hallelujah we are in trouble if somebody
[14:38] will ask you just tell them we are I am
[14:46] your brother
[14:47] hallelujah just tell them hallelujah
[14:50] he made Sarah to life hallelujah he got
[14:57] a lot of failures got a lot of mistakes
[15:00] Alleluia but you know what God did say
[15:03] to to Abraham don't worry about him
[15:07] Alleluia I am The Almighty God just walk
[15:11] before me and be thou perfect Alleluia
[15:16] you can imagine brothers and sisters a
[15:20] father of faith a believer of 25 years
[15:26] old 25 years Alleluia and yet a lot of
[15:29] mistakes sometimes when you look too
[15:34] your brother and to your sister oh he
[15:38] has been a believer for a long time and
[15:40] yet he still can do these things I can't
[15:44] believe it
[15:45] hallelujah and maybe sometimes to
[15:49] yourself you discourage your your being
[15:51] discouraged hallelujah I got I still got
[15:55] this hallelujah this weaknesses I know
[15:58] but Barbara Hamm said as long as we are
[16:02] in this place he only we always have
[16:04] this stick in nature hallelujah
[16:10] Abraham in other words all that God was
[16:15] asking Abraham was just simply walk with
[16:19] Him Alleluia not to look him set himself
[16:22] his ups and downs but to see the
[16:25] Almighty God the I am who's like Abraham
[16:28] was not walking in I am The Almighty God
[16:31] hallelujah he can make the impossible
[16:34] possible
[16:35] hallelujah you know the nice things
[16:38] hallelujah what happened the next things
[16:40] is God breath a part of his name into
[16:44] Abram and suddenly his name was changed
[16:47] from a bruh Abram to Abraham hallelujah
[16:51] so just go ahead hallelujah and say I am
[16:58] not perfect not in myself
[17:01] hallelujah but just look hallelujah
[17:04] there is a perfect one Jesus Christ by
[17:08] just believing on what Jesus Christ did
[17:10] he is the only perfect one hallelujah
[17:13] now in Matthew chapter 5 verse 14 he
[17:17] says Jesus said says Jesus say be
[17:23] therefore perfect even as your father
[17:26] which is in heaven is perfect
[17:30] Alleluia in my humanistic mind
[17:35] hallelujah
[17:36] declares that this scripture is so
[17:39] ridiculous and seemingly impossible but
[17:45] my soul says amen
[17:48] you know God will not require from any
[17:52] person that although it is impossible
[17:56] for him to do it but I believe that when
[18:02] God require anything from any person he
[18:07] has a way hallelujah for him to do it I
[18:12] remember one time in when Jesus was
[18:14] preaching hallelujah in in the
[18:17] wilderness and the Bible said 5000 men
[18:22] just the man
[18:24] you know in every gathering the woman is
[18:30] always in majority Alleluia and the
[18:35] Bible said 5000 men so if there were
[18:41] 5000 men I believe the woman is more
[18:46] than 5000 so more than 10,000 how about
[18:51] if every couple they brought with them
[18:55] one one child or two children hallelujah
[19:01] so that was not only 5,000 10,000 or
[19:05] 15,000 more than that
[19:08] hallelujah and then the disciples came
[19:12] to Jesus and said you sent them Alleluia
[19:19] send him away let him buy big ones
[19:22] let bin die food and they were in the
[19:26] wilderness and Jesus was requiring them
[19:29] Alleluia telling them to feed them no no
[19:32] give him food all away so where are they
[19:36] going to get food maybe even though
[19:40] there were twenty corals building corals
[19:43] there or Shoney's hallelujah
[19:48] their food would not be enough for them
[19:51] hallelujah God was required and where
[19:57] was requiring them to feed the people
[20:00] Alleluia
[20:02] is so impossible for them to do that
[20:05] area but Jesus had away he will not
[20:08] require anything from any man if he
[20:10] didn't have a way to do it
[20:12] hallelujah so by two fishes and five
[20:16] loaves of bread
[20:18] hallelujah he feed them hallelujah and
[20:23] they were remaining baskets hallelujah
[20:26] still remaining they were still
[20:30] remaining bread hallelujah
[20:32] so I believe that are though this world
[20:35] is impossible for us to be done
[20:37] eliminate our lives made out perfect be
[20:40] thou a bidder for perfect even as your
[20:42] father which is in heaven is perfect
[20:44] although it is impossible for our human
[20:47] mind but in our soul I believe
[20:50] hallelujah
[20:52] this is possible for us God has a way
[20:55] hallelujah for him to be done in us and
[21:02] furthermore the Bible says that as we
[21:06] walk in the light as he is in the light
[21:08] hallelujah we have fellowship one with
[21:11] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[21:13] cleanses us from all sin Alleluia
[21:18] cleanses us from some hallelujah from
[21:24] all sin so in when we say all is there
[21:28] something remaining nothing if there is
[21:33] no sin Alleluia what do you mean by that
[21:37] Alleluia so the blood of Jesus Christ
[21:41] that cleanses us from all sin the blood
[21:44] of Jesus Christ makes us perfect
[21:47] Alleluia so forget the mistakes
[21:52] Ilia forget the past forget the faults
[21:55] the failures the muck the mire and all
[22:00] the garbage in our lives
[22:01] forget them Alleluia and just keep on
[22:06] working as we walk in the light
[22:09] what means it is a constant hallelujah
[22:13] constant motion
[22:15] not walk today and then create for
[22:21] several months and then go to church
[22:25] hallelujah IPO if you want to go and
[22:28] then hallelujah you know in in the
[22:32] Philippines sometimes when I when I
[22:36] talked all the some people who were in
[22:41] the church before and now they don't go
[22:44] to church anymore
[22:45] how are you brother how are you sister
[22:47] oh yes by the grace of God we are we are
[22:50] still in the Lord we are continuing no
[22:53] brothers and sisters because the Bible
[22:56] says if we walk in the light if we are
[23:00] walking in the light as he is in the
[23:03] light we are fellowshiping one with
[23:06] another if you are not finished shipping
[23:09] one with another you are not walking in
[23:11] the light hallelujah so every service
[23:21] hallelujah you must come
[23:23] hallelujah if you are walking in the
[23:26] light and if we are filling shipping one
[23:30] with another bill is of benefit brothers
[23:32] and sisters Alleluia the blood of Jesus
[23:35] Christ is cleansing us cleansing us
[23:38] every time we come we are not we are not
[23:41] just praising God we're not just singing
[23:43] songs we're not just sick shaking hands
[23:45] with the brothers and with the sisters
[23:47] but there is something that is happening
[23:49] in us hallelujah the blood of Jesus
[23:51] Christ is cleansing as cleansing us are
[23:54] we are we when we go out we we do this a
[23:58] little we do this and when we come
[24:00] Alleluia the blood of Jesus Christ take
[24:03] it the more Alleluia
[24:05] cleanses us from all unrighteousness you
[24:09] know even Paul Alleluia Paul who
[24:15] personally met Jesus Christ in the form
[24:19] of pillar of fire he was born again
[24:23] baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[24:26] he wrote Philippians chapter three
[24:29] verses 12 to 14 he says not as though I
[24:32] had already attained either we are
[24:35] already perfect but I follow after only
[24:39] I follow after he has been born again he
[24:43] has been baptized with the Holy Ghost he
[24:44] made the pillar of fire Alleluia
[24:47] but I follow after that I may apprehend
[24:49] that for which also I am apprehended of
[24:52] Christ Jesus brethren I count not myself
[24:55] to have apprehended but this one thing I
[24:59] do and we are forgetting those things
[25:02] which are behind and reaching forth unto
[25:05] those things which are before I press
[25:08] toward the mark of the prize of the high
[25:10] calling of God in Christ Jesus
[25:14] Alleluia so you need to look forward how
[25:18] God sees you through the perfect
[25:20] sacrifice and he is the only blameless
[25:24] hallelujah Burhan all resist he always
[25:30] mentioned is that looking retro red is
[25:33] white hallelujah when a worshiper
[25:37] Alleluia he have done wrong in the Old
[25:42] Testament and then in his conscience he
[25:46] is a sinner he was a sinner then he will
[25:49] take a lamb and bring it to the brass in
[25:56] altar Alleluia where the priests are
[26:00] kills done the sacrifices every day and
[26:04] then when he got there the priest will
[26:08] not interrogate him will not investigate
[26:11] what kind of scene you have how often
[26:14] you know it how did you do it why did
[26:18] you do it
[26:18] Alleluia and how many times you did it
[26:22] Alleluia he just standard Alleluia and
[26:25] the priest will examine the sacrifice
[26:30] hallelujah and when the sacrifice is
[26:32] accepted
[26:34] Alleluia then the priest will kill
[26:37] Olivia that that sacrifice and
[26:40] the worshiper will will identify himself
[26:44] with that sacrifice ladies hands upon
[26:46] that sacrifice hallelujah and then after
[26:49] that he will go home happy
[26:50] hallelujah the priest did not ask him
[26:54] anything about his sin he was not
[26:57] examined the president examine him the
[27:01] priest only examine the sacrifice
[27:03] hallelujah and God hallelujah he only
[27:09] examine hallelujah
[27:12] our perfect sacrifice Jesus Christ
[27:18] hallelujah and you know brothers and
[27:21] sisters although we have this you know
[27:26] we have this weaknesses we have every
[27:29] day we commit we die daily we box-like
[27:32] daily yet hallelujah in the mind of God
[27:37] he saw you're perfect before the
[27:40] foundation of the earth
[27:41] earlier the one that his he saw in his
[27:46] mind is a perfect one hallelujah
[27:50] just like in building a building you
[27:57] know in in my place it is a city yet it
[28:05] don't look like one look like a city you
[28:11] know for a long time that we don't have

[28:38] the mall although it is not that you
[28:40] know it is just an ordinary kind of mall

[28:52] and then the demolished the old market
[28:56] and then we saw those those materials
[29:01] that they were bringing to that to the

[29:14] children when they came from school they
[29:16] said oh the gusano is is so beautiful

[29:28] one day I went to the city and because
[29:32] our our house is outside the city and

[50:11] separation for our purification obscene
[50:14] Alleluia so there is the flesh and there
[50:18] is the blood only not only the flesh but
[50:22] also the blood Alleluia and in the

[50:45] the priest shall take up her blood with
[50:49] his finger not fingers Alleluia and
[50:53] sprinkle of her blood directly before
[50:56] the tabernacle of the congregation
[50:59] seven times because if the press will
[51:03] dip his fingers into the blood and we'll
[51:07] sprinkle seven times so there would be
[51:09] twenty stripes but there were only
[51:13] hallelujah seven Elyria stripes
[51:17] hallelujah oh now in front of the
[51:21] tabernacle where the people goes through
[51:24] under the blood Alleluia so it it is a
[51:27] pipe earlier there are semen bloods on
[51:30] the signatures ages Alleluia and verse
[51:37] 12 he says he shall purify himself we
[51:41] read on the third day and on the seventh
[51:43] day he shall be clean but if he purify
[51:47] not himself on the third day then the
[51:49] seventh day he shall not be clean
[51:52] whosoever touches that the body of any
[51:55] man that is dead and purify it not
[51:57] himself defile it the tabernacle of the
[51:59] Lord and that soul shall be cut off from
[52:02] Israel because the waters of separations
[52:05] separation was not upon him he shall be
[52:08] unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him
[52:12] so if he will not be was within seven
[52:20] days that soul shall be cut off he
[52:23] cannot come into the congregation
[52:26] Alleluia
[52:27] he could not come he could not enter
[52:29] into the tabernacle and the tabernacle
[52:32] it is that choosing place of worship
[52:36] hallelujah it is a place prepared by God
[52:39] Alleluia and you cannot get there unless
[52:43] you are pleased by the waters of
[52:45] separation Alleluia and then unless you
[52:48] go through under the blood Alleluia and
[52:53] how a man could be defined it says
[52:58] whosoever touches that the body of any
[53:02] man that is dead and purified not
[53:05] himself defile 8 the tabernacle of the
[53:07] Lord whosoever touches the dead body and
[53:15] we know that in the Garden of Eden there
[53:20] were two trees hallelujah
[53:23] the woman was called the tree of death
[53:26] and Jesus Christ was called the Tree of
[53:31] Life
[53:32] Brennan said in Jehovah Jireh
[53:36] though he says Christ that tree that was
[53:40] in the Garden of Eden there were two
[53:43] trees in the Garden of Eden these two
[53:46] trees were sit there for a birth purpose
[53:49] if she was the tree of death if she was
[53:56] touched Alleluia and Christ was the Tree
[54:01] of Life now by the woman comes death by
[54:04] the man comes life hallelujah so if a
[54:09] man touches a dead body he would be
[54:11] defiled and anybody that came out from
[54:17] that tree of death the woman he is
[54:21] defiled
[54:22] that's why job says in in in in Jude
[54:25] chapter 14 verse 1 hallelujah
[54:28] a man that is born of a woman is of few
[54:30] days and full of trouble we are all
[54:34] unclean Alleluia in juices can you get a
[54:38] cleansing out of an unclean no we are
[54:42] all unclean we are all defined that way
[54:46] that's why we need to be washed by the
[54:48] waters of separation Alleluia now in the
[54:53] Old Testament that is only a shadow
[54:55] that's only the type now when we adopt
[54:58] the flesh of the red heifer and the
[55:02] blood Alleluia but in the old day in in
[55:06] the New Testament official chapter 5
[55:09] verse 26 says that he might sanctify and
[55:12] cleanse it with the washing of water by
[55:15] the word
[55:18] Aliyah we have the world hallelujah that
[55:22] makes us clean earlier that's why
[55:26] when we come to church we are not I can
[55:30] say we are not just praising the
[55:32] darkness just shaking hands with the
[55:36] brothers and sisters or singing or
[55:37] Alleluia we are being washed hallelujah
[55:41] something is happening the Lord is
[55:43] washing us by the word hallelujah and
[55:47] not only by the world not only by the
[55:49] ashes but by the blood Olivia and the
[55:54] life is in the blood the Spirit is in

[56:13] Holy Spirit of promise now here is the
[56:18] word and the blood hallelujah but not
[56:24] only just simply the word hallelujah
[56:32] second Peter chapter 1 verse 12 he says

[56:40] things though you know do you know them
[56:43] and be established in the present truth

[57:07] was killed yesterday
[57:08] you cannot sprinkle it today when you
[57:13] kill an animal yesterday hallelujah the
[57:18] blood of that animal would you know
[57:20] become hard and you cannot sprinkle it
[57:24] hallelujah only the fresh hallelujah the

[57:36] Eden the Word of God is
[57:39] three hallelujah God mentioned tree it
[57:44] was the Word of God in the Garden of

[58:07] lights will say oh we are we are here

[58:13] this Red Sea hallelujah but God did not
[58:18] mention any ark although the artist the

[58:23] another word and God has away hallelujah
[58:29] for them in the time of Moses hallelujah
[58:34] just like in the time of Jesus he said
[58:37] he was a pointing to gently but this
[58:43] hallelujah he was a burning light
[58:46] hallelujah and then gently pop this is I
[58:53] must decrease and he must increase and
[58:56] then Jesus said I am now the light of
[58:59] the world but before he was risen
[59:03] Alleluia he went to his throne he said
[59:06] ye are not the light Alleluia
[59:10] and then Alleluia

[1:00:55] Bible says that for where the carcass
[1:00:58] carcasses there the eagles gathered
[1:01:01] hallelujah not the animal animal that
[1:01:04] was dead several days ago
[1:01:07] earlier but the fresh alleluia alleluia

[1:02:44] sinner you are doing you know that's why
[1:02:46] you are reaping now what you what you
[1:02:48] are doing

[1:02:52] friends and even his wife hallelujah
[1:02:56] were accusing job in the sight of the
[1:03:01] people Ilia he was a sinner but when we
[1:03:06] read about what God said about job
[1:03:09] alleluja alleluja joke 1 1 there was a
[1:03:15] man in the Land of Oz whose name was job
[1:03:18] and that man was perfect and upright

[1:03:27] there is no righteous there is no
[1:03:30] righteous no not one just in one person
[1:03:34] no no no no no righteous alleluia
[1:03:38] because job he walk with God he walked
[1:03:42] with the revelation of God in this day
[1:03:44] then we can see what God said about him
[1:03:47] he was perfect Alleluia just like you
[1:03:53] know you know what's a rupture do you
[1:04:01] believe God will rupture a man that is
[1:04:05] not perfect

[1:04:16] is a perfect Kingdom it should be a
[1:04:18] perfect people hallelujah to get there
[1:04:21] and job was was was was ruptured

[1:04:46] the life of Noah hallelujah in the days
[1:04:51] of Noah the Bible says and get even God
[1:04:55] here even God he repented that he made
[1:04:59] man hallelujah because in that day is
[1:05:02] Alleluia he says all the imaginations of
[1:05:05] the heart of man was continually even do
[1:05:10] you think Noah was exempted in that
[1:05:13] condition no because the Bible says but
[1:05:18] Noah found grace in the sight of God

[1:05:28] by grace and after the blood what didn't

[1:06:04] just man and perfect in his generation
[1:06:10] why what made him perfect and Noah
[1:06:15] walked with God hallelujah
[1:06:19] I believe brothers and sisters we may
[1:06:21] not be as perfect as people are what
[1:06:31] they are looking hallelujah but in the
[1:06:33] sight of God as long as we are walking
[1:06:34] with God as long as we are believing as
[1:06:37] long as we are living hallelujah
[1:06:39] everyday with him hallelujah we are not
[1:06:43] perfect by our own but because of the
[1:06:46] blood of Jesus Christ that planes hit us
[1:06:48] from all when we say all means all
[1:06:53] earlier all seen hallelujah Genesis 17
