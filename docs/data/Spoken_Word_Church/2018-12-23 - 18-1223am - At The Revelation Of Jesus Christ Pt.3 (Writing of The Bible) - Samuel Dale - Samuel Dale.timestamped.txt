[13:04] Peter and revelations but let's pray it
[13:06] that way and pray as a church to bind
[13:09] this enemy of Satan that's going from

[13:25] and as we said we don't have to wait we
[13:28] get sick to pray for you to come on the

[13:38] enemy that's come against our church
[13:40] Lord and the people of the church and
[13:42] the things and we ask you to just reach
[13:45] down and touch each one and put the

[16:35] service on December the 30th that's the
[16:37] only cancellation now

[16:43] weekend all right there won't be the
[16:48] only service this canceled is the one on

[16:57] and having the service for the watch
[17:00] night and going through and all that
[17:02] even we will not cancel the first of the
[17:04] year we're not cancelling just that one
[17:08] service right everybody got it December
[17:11] the 30th which is the Sunday service is
[17:15] cancelled because of going over into the
[17:19] Monday and the watch night service okay
[17:22] all right let's see I got my I got my
[17:31] scripture wrote down
[17:39] well let's go to first Peter 1 verse 7
[17:44] that they're trying of your faith being
[17:48] much more precious than of gold at
[17:50] precious though it be tried with fire
[17:52] might be found unto the praise and honor
[17:55] and glory at the appearing of Jesus
[17:57] Christ now remember how we covered it
[18:00] there's a difference in the peering
[18:02] difference in the coming alright he can
[18:05] appear right over here today heal the
[18:07] sick do all kind of things that's his
[18:11] appearing he can appear all over the
[18:13] world
[18:13] that's his appearing but his coming is
[18:16] only for one purpose now it's not coming
[18:20] because that he's coming to end all
[18:22] things no that's all that's all involved
[18:25] in he's coming for the bride alright so
[18:29] that's the the difference between the
[18:31] appearing and the coming of the Lord
[18:34] and having not seen you love in him
[18:37] though now you see him not yet believing
[18:40] and you rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[18:44] full of glory receiving what now the end
[18:47] of your faith what is the end of your
[18:50] faith even the salvation of your souls
[18:55] of which salvation the prophets have
[18:57] inquired and searched diligently who
[19:00] profits out of the grace that should
[19:02] come unto you searching what or what
[19:05] manner of time the Spirit of Christ
[19:09] which was in them did signify when it
[19:13] testified beforehand the sufferings of
[19:15] Christ and the glory that should be
[19:17] thought that should follow now remember
[19:20] this is the I'm trying to get you to
[19:22] look at it cuz we're gonna talk about
[19:23] the entire Bible alright so this is
[19:27] going back into that now
[19:29] alright unto whom it was revealed that
[19:32] not unto themselves
[19:33] now see they saw things back dark but
[19:36] not clearly they couldn't figure it out
[19:39] exactly but they knew something was
[19:41] taking place but they knew then that if
[19:45] it was not taking place to them right
[19:47] then it was for someone else right unto
[19:53] whom it was revealed that not unto
[19:55] themselves but unto us they did minister
[19:58] the things which are now reported unto
[20:01] you by them that have preached the
[20:03] gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent
[20:06] down from heaven which things the angels
[20:09] desire to look into wherefore gird up
[20:12] the loins of your mind be sober and hope
[20:15] to the end for the grace that is to be
[20:18] brought unto you at the revelation of
[20:22] Jesus Christ all right now
[20:26] so we're just approaching the church
[20:31] ages so let's read again what we did
[20:34] from revelations one it says the
[20:39] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[20:42] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[20:45] things which must shortly come to pass
[20:47] and he sent and signified it by his
[20:50] angel unto his servant John who by
[20:54] record of the word of God and of the
[20:56] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[20:59] things that he saw blessed is he that
[21:03] readeth and they that hear the words of
[21:05] this prophecy and keep those things
[21:08] which are written dar in for the time is
[21:11] at hand you may be seated the Lord at
[21:14] his blessing to the reading of the word
[21:16] no we've spent two services already
[21:25] trying to lay a background into what we
[21:29] want to do as I said we will start we're
[21:33] gonna cover it real slow but we will
[21:36] start with the church ages so if you
[21:39] want to read your church age book if
[21:41] there's a good opportunity I love the
[21:43] reading and I love to read the church
[21:45] age book I do to me it's a marvelous
[21:49] piece of equipment and all and you know
[21:54] I love to read it because you'll see
[21:57] more and a little bit I hope why that
[22:01] it's like it is it's marvelous it's
[22:03] placed exactly ending up of all things
[22:07] all right
[22:08] but now what's been our thought brother
[22:13] branham said
[22:15] I gave you the quote our Sunday or life
[22:20] service that God was saying now John
[22:28] before I tell you anything I want you to
[22:33] know who I am right now he said before I
[22:38] tell you anything others before I start
[22:40] any part about the showing the church
[22:45] ages or anything I want you to know who
[22:48] I am alright so we went through that a
[22:52] couple of services to make sure that we
[22:54] understood following the truth of one
[22:58] true and living God and I hope that was
[23:00] a help to you to understand about those
[23:04] things because you know in the writing
[23:09] of the Bible that's what we're going to
[23:13] be dealing with that today in the
[23:16] writing of the Bible it is to be the
[23:19] revelation of Jesus Christ right now
[23:23] it's not the revelation of of me are you
[23:29] that's second I don't know where the
[23:32] word to use secondary is a right word to
[23:34] use but that comes into being because of
[23:39] what the truth is the truth is that the
[23:42] Bible is to reveal one God well it is to
[23:47] bring into being the understanding of
[23:49] that God to us and you say yeah but is
[23:53] it says the revelation that God give to
[23:55] Jesus to give to John to give the angel
[23:58] and and then it just it just this
[24:01] confusing in my mind you know because
[24:04] how many people are they well if you get
[24:09] it in the right order like I've tried to
[24:10] bring it you'll see that it comes down
[24:13] to the right understanding all right
[24:15] brother branham in our lifes references
[24:17] we were referring to that the reason
[24:20] that it's apples didn't understand the
[24:22] Lord Jesus because he they were not you
[24:28] know they were not prophets for the word
[24:31] to come to at that time and they were
[24:33] not filled with the Holy Ghost at that
[24:35] time so they were human beings that were
[24:38] you know dwelling in that area I think
[24:42] we have a visitor back there with us
[24:44] maybe so but looking around us in new
[24:52] you face anyhow if it is we say welcome
[24:55] to you all right no but now if the Bible
[25:02] and we're talking about the Bible if the
[25:07] Bible is what we have acclaimed it to be
[25:10] why not believe it to be sent to you and
[25:15] I and reveal to us and even to be able
[25:19] to read
[25:21] as it says in verse 3 that there's a
[25:24] blessing to just read it to just have
[25:28] the Bible to just be able to possess one
[25:33] is a great blessing because it is the
[25:38] ability then to be able to contact God
[25:46] but you can't contact him as in too many
[25:49] other ways and thoughts of mankind as
[25:53] intellectualism
[25:56] it must be that you you you see him by
[25:59] the revealing of himself unto you and I
[26:03] and remember now I've always said it I
[26:06] like this point may not mean nothing to
[26:09] you but this is my Bible no this is the
[26:15] way I believe it you know it was given
[26:18] to me I think this one was given to my
[26:20] brother Colley but I'm not certain to
[26:22] know I got one at was but this is my
[26:24] Bible you said well well I've got one
[26:28] too well all right that's your Bible
[26:32] that's not my Bible my Bible is my
[26:39] ability to contact God to hear from him
[26:43] and understand what he wants me to know
[26:46] all right and it belongs to me it was
[26:51] sent to me given to me all right
[26:55] see that way you can say well God gave
[26:58] me his word all right then you're not
[27:02] dealing with letters on the page you're
[27:07] dealing with something that you've
[27:08] actually possessed
[27:12] all right and being that way then the
[27:16] Bible is a is a wonderful book because
[27:21] it reveals the beginning it reveals
[27:25] what's taking place it reveals what will
[27:28] take place you know it's ever been
[27:32] revealed in the Bible all right
[27:36] that's a marvelous book to be able to
[27:38] cover 6,000 years of time all right but
[27:45] you know my my points always been this
[27:48] away cuz I'll get right straight to my
[27:50] thought me
[27:52] I believe the writing of the Bible is
[27:55] the most marvelous thing I remember now
[27:58] about two maybe six months six or eight
[28:02] months ago a year ago I spoke on this
[28:05] line but I want you to think on it to me
[28:10] there's never been a book that could
[28:13] ever fit in any way or in any comparison
[28:17] to the Bible because it's God's way of
[28:25] revealing himself to mankind but yet I
[28:33] love the way the Prophet said it one day
[28:35] he said even though the fall came and
[28:40] situations happened and all like that
[28:42] and the grapes in it problem he said you
[28:45] know God didn't stay up in heaven
[28:50] said he come down to live with us now
[28:57] that to me is marvelous that he come
[29:01] right down to this world to live with us
[29:04] and see then one of these days you're
[29:07] gonna find out at least I'll keep
[29:10] driving it until we can see it that the
[29:14] writing of the Bible is the writing of
[29:16] to you of the revelation of God to you
[29:23] personally but you know what it's so
[29:31] personal and so real until you're part
[29:34] of the word you are a part of see we
[29:40] take it that it writes about you know
[29:42] you can take the Bible and you can read
[29:44] it and you can say well this took place
[29:46] here and this took place here and that
[29:48] took place here and that's is you know
[29:50] reading through the Bible but remember
[29:54] that there was always people involved
[30:01] someone to make alive what he's written
[30:08] because if not why ride it you know I
[30:12] mean God before the world he could set
[30:15] back no the whole time he he knew the
[30:16] beginning from the end you know the
[30:18] whole thing before he ever even started
[30:20] but he didn't do it that way and he
[30:25] didn't come down and and try to force us
[30:29] in any way he come down and brought to
[30:32] you and I for whatever the day in time
[30:38] to be part of his word see when I read
[30:43] in the beginning God created heavens in
[30:46] the earth you know well you know what I
[30:50] read there I mean that's him telling me
[30:52] that in the beginning he created heavens
[30:54] in the earth that's why that's the
[30:56] creating of heavens and earth being
[30:58] described in letter form right you know
[31:04] that's that's the letter form of looking
[31:07] at the Bible well we'll see somebody had
[31:10] to make that alive right so there had to
[31:17] be if it was written there had to be an
[31:21] Abraham are you women and listening they
[31:28] had to be a people if God was going to
[31:33] send her deliverer down to Egypt they
[31:37] would have to be a deliverer sent to
[31:39] Egypt well so he would send Moses you
[31:45] know what Moses would run around said
[31:46] Moses was the alive word woman wait a
[31:53] minute now I don't see you don't don't
[31:55] take the wrong wording Moses was the
[31:59] word that God had spoken made alive in
[32:02] human flesh that walked upon the earth
[32:07] did that make Moses anything no it made
[32:12] him what God said he was he was a
[32:16] deliverer he was the one to come and
[32:18] bring the message all right the prophets
[32:22] brought the Bible
[32:25] and the truth come on the prophets wrote
[32:29] the Bible they come down through and
[32:32] they were riding it but somebody had to
[32:34] make that alive it wasn't just a bunch
[32:41] of men chosen well this man was chose to
[32:43] ride up to here and then this was chosen
[32:44] right here and this was till there was
[32:47] people making that alive a living word
[32:55] look at the Bible like that instead of
[32:58] just letters on the page or talking
[33:00] about a god look at it as that God as
[33:06] he's revealing himself through his word
[33:14] but you know then you're a part of that
[33:20] it's it's not that it's not that we just
[33:23] get the opportunity to read it
[33:26] what about a people that are living it
[33:31] now if he's Hebrews 13:8 as we have
[33:37] emphasized so much then he's the same
[33:41] yesterday today and forever so whatever
[33:44] he was in Genesis he's always been that
[33:47] and always will be that because he's the
[33:51] word all right
[33:53] but tip my thought now and we'll try to
[33:55] progress a little that see there's
[33:59] always been somebody to Michael I've the
[34:06] word of God because see it would not be
[34:11] the Bible first off if it wasn't the
[34:18] Word of God and - it wouldn't be the
[34:22] Bible if it wasn't not I mean if it
[34:25] wasn't the fact of being somebody to
[34:28] make that alive all right no you know I
[34:36] try to make a point or a thought to you
[34:40] to think over what has happened instead
[34:44] of us just reading about something else
[34:49] now that's why that we read that
[34:52] scripture see those prophets and things
[34:55] coming down they knew something was
[34:59] taking place they knew the spirit within
[35:02] them was moving them to a go certain way
[35:06] or to do a certain thing or to write a
[35:09] certain points
[35:11] all right and as they were doing that
[35:16] they knew something was transpiring we
[35:21] see that was that was Christ that's why
[35:27] the Prophet says it he said if you don't
[35:30] see Christ in ever verse he said go back
[35:34] and read it again he's because you
[35:36] missed it now you didn't say Jesus
[35:38] because you can't find Jesus in every
[35:40] verse but you can find the Christ the
[35:43] anointing are the anointed has to be
[35:49] that well I and see then it took all of
[35:54] those a prophet brought it out from
[35:56] masterpiece or you know going like that
[36:00] you know masterpiece good one he said
[36:05] Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph and he
[36:10] said now that was the foundation huh
[36:15] then he said and then the prophets built
[36:18] the body what other words the prophets
[36:24] wrote the Bible they built the body the
[36:29] writing of the Bible was the building of
[36:31] the body of Jesus Christ not physically
[36:34] now come on it was getting things in
[36:38] order to work that it could transpire
[36:42] see then the lice was John the Baptist
[36:45] who come to introduce the Messiah all
[36:49] right see then the Messiah walked out
[36:53] God in human flesh according to John
[36:56] 1:14 and the Word was made flesh and
[36:58] dwelt among us all right see then that
[37:03] that means that the Bible was not just
[37:06] dead letters
[37:09] even those prophets they knew something
[37:13] you know they knew something was
[37:18] motivating them to go certain ways and
[37:20] and to do and those prophets would go in
[37:25] and do things like you've heard the
[37:28] Prophet sit this way said what do you
[37:30] think that did I say I thought about
[37:32] such a virgin shall conceive
[37:36] well he knew physically he knew
[37:39] everything in the natural rim he knew
[37:41] everything as far as humanly speaking
[37:43] was totally contrary to what he just
[37:46] said we knew something was motivating
[37:53] him to say that what was motivating him
[37:58] to say that was the fact that one day
[38:01] that would come into a reality to be
[38:05] made flesh and a baby would be born
[38:10] right see those people were more back
[38:15] there and I know what you think did what
[38:17] we think about we think oh they just
[38:18] people they just done is a they were
[38:20] people that are living is the Word of
[38:24] God
[38:28] they were the alive word for the time
[38:33] can you follow that line see then if you
[38:39] can then you can follow it own crew and
[38:43] see that the Lord Jesus Christ came and
[38:46] walked upon this earth those prophets
[38:50] brought that book you know not they
[38:53] didn't have to write it some of them
[38:54] didn't even write some of them others
[38:58] had to write the different things right
[38:59] it's not to just say well that wrote
[39:02] this or they wrote know some of the
[39:04] other times I mean some some of them
[39:06] couldn't write at all somebody else had
[39:09] to write it all right but see when it
[39:13] was finished God stepped in to human
[39:18] flesh cause the Lord Jesus Christ all
[39:24] right
[39:24] and as he did he became the word made
[39:30] alive and the Bible is the revelation of
[39:37] Jesus Christ so he became what was
[39:43] spoken
[39:46] became a reality all right
[39:51] I told you we're we're approaching some
[39:54] things that I said I'm gonna lay in a
[39:56] few things it's going to be uh you know
[39:59] you're gonna have to think a little
[40:02] there's a lot of gaps in the Bible that
[40:05] needs to be filled up in the breaches
[40:07] coughs you know there's gaps there
[40:12] well I see there's like a gap between
[40:15] the book of Acts there's a gap between
[40:19] Calvary in the book of Acts the Lord
[40:22] Jesus had to come fulfilled and do all
[40:24] he had to do there's a gap between the
[40:27] book of Acts and then the church age is
[40:30] starting then there's a gap between the
[40:32] church ages see and the age is coming
[40:37] themselves and that has to be made a
[40:42] reality all right see my point is do we
[40:50] look at the Bible as some kind of a book
[40:54] that has been written
[40:59] to speak of God to speak of his ways and
[41:02] doun and say do we look at it like that
[41:05] or do we look at it as it being written
[41:08] now according to Paul Paul says you are
[41:20] written epistles well now I written
[41:29] epistle if you're gonna make plain sense
[41:32] out of it it means something got roped I
[41:37] mean is that southern something took
[41:41] place and see you are written epistle
[41:48] there's something in your life that is
[41:54] to display where your out comes now
[42:01] listen see we we look at the bow
[42:06] Lissette as this like some kind of a
[42:08] book we'll remember that book is still
[42:13] being written
[42:20] what about that that book is still in
[42:23] the place stages or phases of being
[42:26] written because there's things that have
[42:29] not been my life yet right there's
[42:36] things in the Bible that it's future
[42:39] tense that has not transpired see and
[42:48] we're in see the writing of the Bible
[42:54] we're in that basis of of it being
[42:57] brought in to something that people can
[43:04] read come on you sisters going out on
[43:13] the street and walking down the road
[43:15] with your long hair you dresses and your
[43:19] clothes and the things being correctly
[43:22] in order according to the word you
[43:25] realize that you're a Bible walking you
[43:33] realize they're gonna you're gonna be
[43:34] used as a judgement um at the judgment
[43:38] you V Stander's
[43:40] you know and people will look at what
[43:44] they see and they'll be judged by that
[43:49] GRU are you following me see we think
[43:53] about the Bible or the Bible that was
[43:55] wrote 2,000 years ago
[43:57] that's what I want you to get the Old
[44:02] Testament was brought to a close as the
[44:05] writing of what would transpire and John
[44:09] would come into being yin and the things
[44:12] would happen and introduce the Messiah
[44:16] and that was the finishing up of the Old
[44:19] Testament the writing of the Old
[44:23] Testament was brought to a close because
[44:27] there stood the god of the Old Testament
[44:31] in human flesh that's what brought it to
[44:35] a close that's why the Bible said it
[44:37] since Christ is the end of the law for
[44:40] righteousness to them that believe you
[44:45] said with a lolly in about now Christ is
[44:47] the end of the law if you're not in
[44:49] Christ you're still under the law now
[44:52] that's what people don't like if you're
[44:56] not a born-again believer tonight the
[44:58] law is still in existence and will
[45:01] condemn us you don't have to have a
[45:03] another book to bring up you don't have
[45:04] to bring up your daily life to condemn
[45:08] you judgment he just brings up the fact
[45:11] what you do with the law because the law
[45:14] is still in existence no no brother Dale
[45:17] we've been told all of our yeah we've
[45:18] been told all of our life that the law
[45:21] ended there no it didn't end there
[45:28] it only ends when you're born again if
[45:32] you're not born again you're still under
[45:34] the law I don't care who we are let's
[45:38] see if we don't want it that away we
[45:41] think it's some kind of a book that was
[45:43] written I'm talking about something
[45:47] taking place even now do you realize if
[45:54] there's a day a time a movement of the
[45:57] clock that means that reality is taking
[46:02] place among us you know life and God is
[46:11] still riding see that's what I want you
[46:18] to think about for a minute when John
[46:26] was on patent Asst he was in the spirit
[46:31] on the Lord's Day and he was told to
[46:37] write he was told now writing sin to the
[46:45] seven churches well you know what those
[46:50] seven churches were in existence at that
[46:53] time those seven cities that were used
[46:56] to be able to lay each with the Church
[46:59] agent and break it down at Ephesus and
[47:01] Smyrna etc etc right and if that's true
[47:08] and we're living in lay do say then
[47:12] we're not finished yet
[47:19] so you'll find this as we go through the
[47:22] ages and times we talk about what would
[47:25] be called the dark ages of time you know
[47:28] for about a thousand years back there
[47:30] that in the tyrant church age right
[47:33] through that area third fourth and
[47:35] coming in we talk about that as being a
[47:42] horrible - but you know what that was
[47:44] what the word said was gonna take place
[47:51] just as much as Moses was going to go to
[47:54] Egypt that was going to be a persecution
[48:03] a things happened and it was written
[48:09] before it ever happened but as I said
[48:16] while ago now you kind of shook her head
[48:18] and agreed a little or smiled anyway
[48:20] Justin had you know that Moses was the
[48:23] alive word that had been spoken you know
[48:27] that they would be a deliverer come down
[48:29] and they'd be there for so many years
[48:30] and they they'd be this way and they'd
[48:32] be that way and then Moses would would
[48:35] come forth and they'd be delivered and
[48:37] all I can well why not bring that
[48:39] reality over to where we're living right
[48:41] now and it might change our thinking
[48:44] about a lot of things
[48:49] but brother Dale you sound like you're
[48:51] talking about the Bible still being
[48:53] written that's exactly what I'm doing
[48:56] because John on Patmos was told to write
[49:04] what he saw you know what he saw he saw
[49:13] what was taking place he saw what would
[49:16] be he saw what his age would be right
[49:24] and at least to say that we are in the
[49:30] lady of cien age as far as physically
[49:33] speaking then God is still riding or
[49:43] else one with Paul call us written
[49:45] epistles he said known in read of all
[49:49] man people can see you they they know
[49:53] you they know what you stand for they
[50:00] know what you're doing that's why it's
[50:02] so important to be that and then not be
[50:05] wishy-washy to be this today and then
[50:07] tomorrow and then we in and out and we
[50:09] you know own up and down no it's to be
[50:11] the same always
[50:14] to walk in Christ and let the world see
[50:18] Christ you realize what people are going
[50:22] to be judged by you realize you're going
[50:27] to be there we'll get back to that when
[50:28] we get into the to the Sevenfold glories
[50:31] and the different things and the
[50:32] judgment and how the the things that you
[50:35] realize people are gonna be judged by
[50:38] alive people you are gonna sit on the
[50:42] throne with Jesus Christ and judge the
[50:46] world you've been taught that haven't
[50:49] you
[50:50] to know that much that you'll be judged
[50:56] and see there won't be no argument
[51:02] because you'll be sitting there and god
[51:06] of this simpler did you testify yeah did
[51:13] you live this do you do that yeah well
[51:17] then they won't be no argument because
[51:22] it's still being written see the white
[51:25] throne hadn't come into existence yet
[51:28] right the judge switching the thing it
[51:31] hasn't come into existence that's what
[51:33] I'm trying to get you to see there's
[51:36] things in the Bible that has not come
[51:37] into reality
[51:42] we're living that reality this is a
[51:46] living word this is not dead letters on
[51:50] the page it's God living in his people
[51:58] manifested himself revealing himself
[52:00] showing himself to the world no wonder
[52:08] it's gonna be a horrible time into
[52:10] judgment because he won't be able to
[52:12] hide her own selves or nothing that's
[52:15] why I want to make sure that we've got
[52:16] it all covered before we get that right
[52:22] but do you see the reality see the Bible
[52:30] is the complete revelation of Jesus
[52:33] Christ
[52:35] all right now in that point Matthew says
[52:43] upon this rock I'll build my church and
[52:46] the gates of Hell cannot prevail against
[52:48] it right all right so now there's no way
[52:54] to stop the church from coming into
[52:58] reality because it's promised now if the
[53:05] point is if we're part of that we're in
[53:08] good shape but if not we're just reading
[53:12] somebody else's mail right we read
[53:17] somebody else's book instead of seeing
[53:22] ourselves
[53:26] instead of seeing who we are and what's
[53:28] taking place
[53:30] we're just reading to watch somebody
[53:32] else says all right so when John comes
[53:42] to to bring the the word in other words
[53:48] writing it's an amazing thing that God
[53:53] says the revelation that God give to
[53:56] Jesus to give to John what now listen we
[54:03] believe in that one true and living God
[54:05] truly okay but remember now in the way
[54:13] that we believe in one true and living
[54:15] God has got to be as I've tried to
[54:18] express with this last few messages
[54:23] that if we don't see God as real
[54:28] and see how he reveals himself how are
[54:32] we gonna know anything about our
[54:33] ourselves and the Bible says that even
[54:39] the eternal Godhead can be revealed or
[54:45] made known by the things that we see so
[54:53] here comes a little profit along trying
[54:55] to explain one God right I mean the
[55:00] theologians has got to theophanies and I
[55:03] guess the ticket brought around
[55:04] sometimes he called it the octopus and
[55:06] he'll have all kind of words for that
[55:09] totally like the rest of us you know no
[55:11] education but though stielow's is trying
[55:15] to explain that and they know they can't
[55:17] do it but he says it's very simple
[55:23] he said there's not three gods
[55:28] he said that's hedonism well boy that's
[55:34] that throwed it right there didn't it
[55:36] cuz I'll realize we've taught hedonism
[55:39] you know we swore by it we fought for it
[55:42] we argued about it they've got to be
[55:46] three hmm what you see the Prophet would
[55:54] make a simple illustration he said I'm a
[55:58] father
[55:59] he said I'm a human I'm a being I'm a
[56:03] person he could give any kind of layouts
[56:05] like it he said but how many are they of
[56:07] me he said I have many manifestations we
[56:14] said I'm only one person
[56:17] they don't theologian going
[56:20] goodness what is this carnality of this
[56:23] man and his idiotic ways of trying to
[56:26] express God that simple and their God
[56:29] was using a man to speak the revelation
[56:34] that had been locked away from mankind
[56:38] all the way through
[56:48] and see very was in simplicity
[56:51] expressing the word he says it now
[56:57] there's not three of me he said then I'm
[56:59] a human being I'm a person and he said
[57:03] and that's the way god he is
[57:04] he said God came down to dwell with us
[57:09] to reveal himself to us and said there
[57:16] he is said he's my father
[57:18] he's been here he's a savior he's now
[57:20] but said how many are the oven he just
[57:22] is simple talking it and then what
[57:30] theologians sitting there saying where
[57:32] did this guy get all of this idiotic
[57:35] thoughts from and he turns around he
[57:39] said okay now let's just solve the
[57:41] problem
[57:42] yeah he says now all of this talk about
[57:46] we can talk about God and and describe
[57:50] him and do all these things but said you
[57:52] know what one word from him is worth
[57:55] more than all that we could talk about
[57:59] he said now if he's real and I've talked
[58:02] the truth said let him come on the scene
[58:05] and he said now here stands a blind man
[58:09] you know you know he was over in foreign
[58:14] countries when he done it but he was
[58:16] doing it every day in front of the
[58:17] congregation
[58:18] he said now if if what I've taught is
[58:21] true then God will heal this man
[58:25] and said if he don't then you don't have
[58:28] to believe nothing and said now let's
[58:33] just see if he'll come honestly but said
[58:35] before I do said why don't y'all come up
[58:37] here and take your theological terms in
[58:41] order and its brain God on the scene so
[58:45] let's see what's onedrive right and
[58:50] here's a little old man had no education
[58:53] whatsoever but yet God would come on the
[58:55] scene and heal the sick raise the dead
[58:58] cast out Devils all kind of things and
[59:04] all that theologians could do was just
[59:06] stand there look I mean I don't admire a
[59:11] lot of them because you know what they
[59:14] said oh we're gonna that member the man
[59:17] the picture wizard listen to it the
[59:18] other day you know man I'm gonna tire
[59:20] his hide and all that and he said God
[59:23] won't allow that to happen
[59:29] simple words brought God on the scene
[59:37] alive before mankind
[59:43] now then the Bible was being written
[59:54] because it said this would take place
[59:58] you'll turn the hearts of the children
[1:00:00] in the faith of us etc it was the
[1:00:03] writing of the word melech high for luke
[1:00:06] 1730 revelation 2:10 7 all of those
[1:00:09] scriptures that we talked about they
[1:00:11] become into a reality living before
[1:00:14] mankind and showing a real God and God
[1:00:21] was still rotten man kind of done
[1:00:24] stopped and done forgot it so you say to
[1:00:27] people when was the Bible written oh it
[1:00:29] was written back oh it was written 2,000
[1:00:32] years ago
[1:00:33] what that might be true but then ask him
[1:00:38] is he still riding no no no no he quit
[1:00:46] writing he quit writing well when did he
[1:00:49] quit writing if you were reading a
[1:00:55] pistol when did he quit writing and as
[1:01:02] long as something is not in full
[1:01:04] manifestation is he not still writing
[1:01:12] because else you're reading histories in
[1:01:14] thing and you're really reading
[1:01:16] prophecies is what you're doing because
[1:01:18] you're reading it looking to the future
[1:01:21] but you know God doesn't do that every
[1:01:25] day it's alive to him one other it be
[1:01:30] alive to you and I
[1:01:39] and seeing baby we might be able to
[1:01:41] catch on one day about the Bible and
[1:01:46] what it really is I believe the Bible is
[1:01:49] the Word of God all right but I believe
[1:01:55] if that word of God no become Satan it
[1:01:59] because I'm firm believing in it I
[1:02:01] believe the Bible is the Word of God and
[1:02:04] the fact of it being the Word of God
[1:02:07] there's no way Satan can attack that and
[1:02:11] destroy it he can't destroy it because
[1:02:16] he can't he can't destroy the kingdom
[1:02:18] that's what Jesus what it was being said
[1:02:21] see upon this rock I'll build my church
[1:02:23] and the gates of Hell cannot prevail you
[1:02:27] mean there's some word that Satan's
[1:02:29] gonna prevail over the Bride of Christ
[1:02:31] no we'll put a down the shore don't look
[1:02:35] too good
[1:02:36] what does that got to do with it see
[1:02:40] that's the way we look at it we look at
[1:02:43] it like the the children of Israel down
[1:02:45] in Egypt and they're being beaten and
[1:02:48] they're being this that and they're
[1:02:50] getting worse and worse and the
[1:02:51] taskmasters is making it worse and worse
[1:02:53] and they're oh what I cried Lord we
[1:02:56] thought she was gonna do something
[1:02:58] worrying that
[1:03:03] and everyday he had a man out in the
[1:03:06] desert getting him ready right the very
[1:03:12] time they were crying and wonder what
[1:03:15] was going on he's getting everything
[1:03:17] ready let's see we don't look at it like
[1:03:22] that we want to see him come on the
[1:03:25] scene hey that's good that's all well
[1:03:30] and good but why can't we get it to the
[1:03:35] basin to see he's already on the scene
[1:03:37] he ain't laughed
[1:03:45] even when I was a trinitarian colorize
[1:03:48] with the rest of us and all of us are
[1:03:50] you know has it even as a finitary and
[1:03:53] they'd say well we won't tell you
[1:03:55] they've taken Christ out of Christmas
[1:03:57] and they never did take Christ out of
[1:04:00] Christmas they've laid it took Christ
[1:04:03] out of Christmas they'd had mass I have
[1:04:08] enough sense to be able to read you take
[1:04:11] Christ out of Christmas and what do you
[1:04:12] got mass
[1:04:18] see and we had him as a trinitarian
[1:04:20] still believed he was right
[1:04:23] you didn't have to restore Christ about
[1:04:25] a Christmas tree or anything but when
[1:04:32] does God stop riding he'll stop riding
[1:04:39] when the times when it time and let's
[1:04:43] see what we return in Revelation is one
[1:04:44] the time is at hand when the time is
[1:04:47] finished God will start riding when all
[1:04:55] of this is over with and we step into
[1:04:57] eternity
[1:04:58] he'll stop riding that's that's what
[1:05:03] I've tried my best to get get you to see
[1:05:06] I know I'm carnal sorry
[1:05:09] I think carnal but you see we say what
[1:05:15] was the last creation well God created
[1:05:17] man in the garden and he quit creating I
[1:05:19] defy that on the basis of God's Word
[1:05:22] that's a lot
[1:05:33] why because according to revelation 3:14
[1:05:37] Jesus is the beginning of the creation
[1:05:46] that was just the beginning of what God
[1:05:49] wanted the rest of it was natural
[1:05:52] mankind and you are what the prophets
[1:05:57] say he said he's the beginning of the
[1:05:59] creation he said and we are the
[1:06:01] continuation of that creation so ever
[1:06:05] time a born-again believer comes into
[1:06:07] the body of Christ God is creating he's
[1:06:12] creating his family why don't we think
[1:06:15] like that sometimes
[1:06:18] his family is being created that's why I
[1:06:27] like the way we talk you know they would
[1:06:31] go to here we go to mom and dad in then
[1:06:35] we go to kids then go to grandkids and
[1:06:38] then go great-great grandkids great guy
[1:06:41] great girl great Gregory Gregory Gregory
[1:06:45] we never stop right
[1:06:53] see if people say my ancestors came over
[1:06:56] on the Mayflower you know well you know
[1:07:00] what they peed somebody's did you could
[1:07:08] what I mean
[1:07:09] mom and daddy thank you
[1:07:12] it never stops that's why war is so
[1:07:17] horrible because war takes out in in
[1:07:22] generations that will never come forth
[1:07:30] killing incinerations
[1:07:33] that's what Satan wants to do but he
[1:07:37] can't stop the kingdom of God because
[1:07:40] there's no ending of this generation our
[1:07:43] generation is we call it
[1:07:50] and as long as God is birthing children
[1:07:57] into his kingdom you know by the new
[1:08:00] birth then God is still writing the
[1:08:11] Bible is still being written come on
[1:08:17] that's the approach I'm trying to make
[1:08:19] it where you were looking to book of
[1:08:20] revelations then when you do you'll be
[1:08:22] able to one day to see that hey we can
[1:08:25] go through the first church age
[1:08:28] and see what took place take the second
[1:08:34] turkey eggs and lay it right in order
[1:08:37] and see what took place and go through
[1:08:43] the church ages and when they do you
[1:08:46] come out to where you're at then you
[1:08:49] realize he's not over he's just
[1:08:52] beginning
[1:09:01] he's not gonna stop the Prophet said God
[1:09:07] will give us the message of tear down to
[1:09:09] the endless ages after time is over with
[1:09:13] you realize these parts of the Bible
[1:09:16] it's not going to be totally fulfilled
[1:09:18] here it will be there because it's
[1:09:23] prophesying speaking when we enter that
[1:09:27] future home you're just beginning no no
[1:09:37] we're good we'll see that's what the
[1:09:39] corn ality is nothing in God ever comes
[1:09:46] to an end
[1:09:53] right
[1:09:55] so he still run
[1:10:01] you realize that in the Bible that spoke
[1:10:04] of the towers when they'd fall the
[1:10:11] Scripture speaks of it we don't want to
[1:10:14] had to be a day that took place all
[1:10:19] right had to be a kingdom of the Greeks
[1:10:23] and the Romans and the the different
[1:10:26] things because it had been written we'll
[1:10:34] see why can't we think when God said
[1:10:40] I'll be with you always
[1:10:46] can he ever turn away from me we turn
[1:10:51] away from him right we know that we do
[1:10:54] that definitely but he can't turn away
[1:10:57] from us cuz he said it yeah but I
[1:11:03] thought the Bible was written yeah
[1:11:05] that's right do you think it was written
[1:11:07] back time
[1:11:13] it was written to say what would take
[1:11:15] place in the ages now come on I'm
[1:11:20] getting it and I'll quit this away and
[1:11:25] see Jesus when he was here on earth they
[1:11:30] would ask in him about when he was
[1:11:32] coming and he said I don't know he said
[1:11:39] the father hasn't revealed that yet to
[1:11:42] me right
[1:11:48] the brother Owen said when he come to
[1:11:50] John on Patmos God had revealed it all
[1:11:57] right so he would write about his coming
[1:12:02] he would write what could not be written
[1:12:05] back there but he would write it in
[1:12:10] stages don't know where the ages stages
[1:12:16] times whatever he wrote about what would
[1:12:22] take place he wrote about himself to be
[1:12:30] living in the ages that's what he's
[1:12:36] still riding well we've had we've had a
[1:12:42] Bible long time here and there it was
[1:12:45] they wrote 2,000 years ago
[1:12:52] that's well good
[1:12:58] really it was written for the foundation
[1:13:00] world I mean going back up okay we back
[1:13:05] away up what the point is there has to
[1:13:12] be
[1:13:13] you don't forget this now did we get
[1:13:15] their next message there has to be a
[1:13:17] people to make a live the word or it's
[1:13:21] not the word why say it there's got to
[1:13:31] be a people to make a live the word of
[1:13:34] God and it is then your written epistles
[1:13:38] and as your written epistles then he's
[1:13:40] finishing his writing in you what we
[1:13:46] think of the Bible like that see we
[1:13:49] think it was wrote thousands of years
[1:13:52] ago
[1:14:00] but there's things in there that hasn't
[1:14:01] been fulfilled well that's just a
[1:14:06] prophecy to come prophecies have to be
[1:14:09] fulfilled
[1:14:09] or else they're not true prophecies
[1:14:12] there had to be a Moses go to Egypt or
[1:14:15] that was the wrong prophecy are you with
[1:14:18] me I'm just trying to get you to see the
[1:14:23] reality of a Christian life the simpler
[1:14:29] reality of a Christian life we can put
[1:14:37] ourselves out of the picture or we can
[1:14:41] bring ourselves into the picture well I
[1:14:47] just don't understand what brother Dale
[1:14:48] talked he sounds like he's talking about
[1:14:50] God's up our now rotting well why not
[1:14:53] are you down you're living it
[1:15:01] I like what one brother told us one time
[1:15:04] it's just brother he had you know then
[1:15:08] it was a story but I believe it
[1:15:10] anyhow the brother had went to a meeting
[1:15:13] or something was going and and brother
[1:15:15] branham spoke to that brother and said
[1:15:18] brother he said you had to fight your
[1:15:22] way here you've heard it said probably
[1:15:25] the brother he said somebody asked him
[1:15:30] later said did you experience anything
[1:15:33] different you know going that day said
[1:15:35] no I just got in the car Lent but you
[1:15:38] see that's what he saw he didn't see all
[1:15:42] of the situation that existed behind it
[1:15:45] that no telling how many of car wrecks
[1:15:48] no telling how many bad things could
[1:15:50] have taken place on the way and was
[1:15:52] diverted around it and took play to get
[1:15:54] that person dire I'm gonna take what the
[1:15:59] Prophet said if that's true what he said
[1:16:00] that he saw things he saw that how
[1:16:05] horrible it was to get there
[1:16:09] they don't think much about it you've
[1:16:12] heard your prophet said in other words
[1:16:13] you going down the highway and all at
[1:16:15] once you make a turn you go well why did
[1:16:16] that turn off what road then I have to
[1:16:22] while you get on the radio find out it
[1:16:23] was a bad wreck on that road that she
[1:16:26] was on you know God can take care of us
[1:16:33] or listen to him sometime you've heard
[1:16:35] the story the Prophet telling about it
[1:16:37] was listen other not to him but to the
[1:16:39] guy you know that was riding a horse and
[1:16:41] the horse wanted to go one way and he
[1:16:43] wanted to go the other and he finally
[1:16:46] let the horse out of the way and they
[1:16:48] plunge right into a river you know they
[1:16:54] we want to try to make God be our way oh
[1:16:59] yeah oh yeah I'm a child of God so I'm
[1:17:03] supposed to be where is it to be said to
[1:17:05] the child garnish is to be put to a
[1:17:08] basis that they're there not to be sick
[1:17:12] because come on many are the afflictions
[1:17:15] of the righteous but the Lord lead us
[1:17:17] out of them all now we don't glory in
[1:17:18] that and say we've got to be sick
[1:17:21] because we're Christians no we don't go
[1:17:23] that away
[1:17:25] we know and realized the fact that we're
[1:17:27] in a world I walk to the door yesterday
[1:17:34] and my niece came over about some
[1:17:36] flowers and I told her I said I'll go
[1:17:39] getting any letter come I said you don't
[1:17:41] need to probably come in I said well
[1:17:43] we're fighting the flu bug around here
[1:17:45] she looked at me in lies she said I
[1:17:48] ain't afraid of no flu bug
[1:17:49] she just pipes right on well you know
[1:17:52] what she won't she won't get the bug as
[1:17:55] quick as somebody oh yeah I'm scared of
[1:17:57] it I'm not going to no no no no cuz
[1:18:01] she's just stubborn enough she said I'm
[1:18:03] not worried about no flu bug well that
[1:18:06] was just a a I call her just plain old
[1:18:08] sinner and they could be that away but
[1:18:12] you see we think well why are we so sick
[1:18:17] well how are we having so many troubles
[1:18:22] now may I quote brother branham he said
[1:18:28] Satan can not come after you unless God
[1:18:33] removes the veil
[1:18:41] what he said now does that mean we can't
[1:18:44] get a bad cold
[1:18:45] no no goes into deeper gram dry but
[1:18:51] that's what I said to start with why
[1:18:53] can't we pray and believe and say Lord
[1:18:55] take care of us
[1:18:57] cover us by the blood keep us covered
[1:19:01] from all of these things that are around
[1:19:04] the world because we're here we're
[1:19:09] living here
[1:19:10] come on musicians we're living here see
[1:19:13] I'm trying my best to get you to see one
[1:19:15] thing and then we'll finish this message
[1:19:17] like what that the Bible is not complete
[1:19:22] yet it's not finished because we're
[1:19:32] still here he's still rotting and every
[1:19:37] time a king a child of God is born into
[1:19:40] the kingdom he's still rotting
[1:19:50] why because the Bible is the Word of God
[1:19:56] and you are the Word of God you're a
[1:20:03] living epistle
[1:20:10] the world is going to be judged by you
[1:20:16] because you are his word
[1:20:22] God's not through and if he's not true I
[1:20:31] might want to say this but I'm gonna say
[1:20:37] it anyway get in trouble with it I stand
[1:20:39] gently do you know if the Bible is set
[1:20:44] and stamped - then ain't nothing we can
[1:20:48] do but just do what it says is that the
[1:20:52] way you think it said that's it
[1:20:58] Bible says gonna be that way is that the
[1:21:02] way God does it it would be if he'd
[1:21:06] already wrote it but what if he ain't
[1:21:09] wrote it yet
[1:21:18] just remember there was a man in the
[1:21:22] Bible one time that God sent him word
[1:21:25] that he was going to pass set your house
[1:21:30] in order cause you're gonna die man
[1:21:39] cried out before God he said Lord
[1:21:43] I need to get my house in order I think
[1:21:48] we know the whole story we'd like to get
[1:21:49] into all of the badge angles out of it
[1:21:52] don't we he should have just went ahead
[1:21:54] and died because he wound up sending
[1:21:56] more to start with well that's the
[1:21:58] things we want to hear we don't want to
[1:22:00] hear the truth did that did God change
[1:22:04] his mind your prophet said he did not he
[1:22:13] said God don't change his mind
[1:22:17] well yeah we know he knew what he was
[1:22:21] gonna do that's right
[1:22:22] cuz he knew the man was gonna ask for
[1:22:27] your dead that's the written word to me
[1:22:35] when I look at the Bible I look at that
[1:22:39] man crying out before God and I look at
[1:22:46] it as God hasn't finished this story yet
[1:22:56] so he says you got 15 more years he's
[1:23:03] gonna die anyway you know we know that
[1:23:04] huh see we think that's the story
[1:23:07] well the Prophet said God didn't change
[1:23:09] his mind within it and had never been
[1:23:14] stamped where he was gonna die it had
[1:23:19] never been told him you're gonna die in
[1:23:22] ten days from now and things of this
[1:23:25] that that's Oakland hot right that was
[1:23:28] not written it was just written you're
[1:23:31] going to die yeah but you're making good
[1:23:36] no I ain't making God change his mind
[1:23:39] I'm letting him walk right through life
[1:23:42] and see what me and you the bigger ones
[1:23:45] just messing it all up he just gives
[1:23:50] that man the time knowing what he's
[1:23:54] gonna do in every way but the thing then
[1:24:01] the thing for me can't say why did you
[1:24:03] for me
[1:24:04] because he didn't do it he gave him a
[1:24:07] choice 15 more years or dying right now
[1:24:11] he said give me the 15 years
[1:24:16] he wasn't through riding I hope that's
[1:24:21] things in it might answer a question did
[1:24:28] God change his mind
[1:24:29] no he just laid the choices out and let
[1:24:34] the man choose what he wanted
[1:24:37] because he knew what the choice would be
[1:24:47] one of these days I'll explain
[1:24:48] predestination enough to understand we
[1:24:57] think everything is stamped that's it
[1:25:04] what if he gives you a choice
[1:25:06] oh but he knows the truck Hey
[1:25:11] we're not we're not into the finality
[1:25:14] z-- we're into the writing of the book
[1:25:18] until the book is written you and I have
[1:25:22] our opportunities that's damn we'll hit
[1:25:28] rather what we got Heavenly Father 5:40

[1:26:04] [Music]
[1:26:09] for being in the writing of the book
[1:26:11] instead of the stamp out book written
[1:26:15] dead anybody have a need
[1:26:29] you had never heard running around and
[1:26:30] say you can pray for God to change his
[1:26:33] mind your listen to the message code of
