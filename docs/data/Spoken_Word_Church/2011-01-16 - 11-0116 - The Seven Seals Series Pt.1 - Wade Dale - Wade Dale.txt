========================================

we are going to now embark on a journey through the seven seal in the Bible but we have to set a basis like I said before for those of you that are late if you need any of these if you do not have a seven seal book that is Personally Yours that you can bring to class I have some you can have if you feel like you need to put an offering there're about 250 a piece I think put it in the offering and we'll order some more so the one with the blue cover is the same thing the one with the blue cover is the same thing the only difference is the old ones the ones put out in the 70s and the 80s is the pages are different it's a different um um page number there's more there's about 10 of them back there on the Shelf but you need to bring it every service from now on every service from now on right everybody right everybody every service from now on we going to have to kind of scoot around let more come in and sit down thank the lord we may have to do it out I would wouldn't bother me AIT I'm sweating like a horse right now start all right let's turn to Malachi 4 because we got set a basis of what we're going to be this may last all year which is fine with me that's a good subject all right Mal four cuz a lot of people don't understand why we know why brother brandham came he came to bring a gift of healing but that really wasn't what he come for um he came to tie up all the Loose Ends but that really wasn't his message folks that had already been preached he come to bring us the mysteries of the Bible that no one had looked upon no one had saw no one had been able to understand from the time that Jesus walked on the earth when in Matthew 24 he went through the seals six of them and him being the literal seventh seal himself which was the son of man standing on the Earth Reeve trying to reveal himself but at that time he was not able to reveal himself because the word had really not even been written at that time cuz remember the word wasn't written until after Jesus died we're talking about the New Testament right the Old Testament could not do that in that it didn't have the power not the Old Testament word but the Old Testament had the blood of bulls and goat that would cover sin but not take away sin all right so the Old Testament could not produce a change of the body we know it was in tyght with Abraham and people like that he had a body change but that was en tyght that was something God allowed to happen to show that it's going to happen in the end time but he told Daniel he said seal up all these things until what until the end time right and this is the end time so God had to come and restore all things according to Joel God had to come and Joel to and show us that the word would be eaten down eaten down and that there would be a restoration back to the book of Acts because the book of Acts was the original Church the book of Acts had power and demonstration the book of Acts had the word of God in its pure form when I say that they did not believe in a eternal hell they did not believe in a father son Holy Ghost they believed in one true Living God they did not baptize in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost no one was ever baptized that way until about 300 ad where the Nan fathers begin to come in and erode our eat the word down but let's read and see in Malachi I know maybe this is Elementary to some but uh at least some on the internet are enjoying it cuz get some good comments about it so if if it becomes old to you then then you need a Revival cuz this thing should this this word should not become old to anybody right cuz even in Malachi 45 and 6 every time I read it I really get to see something different or something new out of this that we've quoted probably since we've been children everybody can quote Malachi 4 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children stop who was that that was John the Baptist he turned the heart of the what did it say the fathers to the children what was it the Old Testament fathers those old Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel Abraham Moses John came to turn Those Old Testament people into fathers to the children what the ACT 238 young Christian is starting a new era a new time all right faith of the father's Old Testament to the faith of the children in the New Testament not something new but yes it was something new something never been done before God had never resided in the heart of man until the book of Acts like he wanted to now he would come on those Old Testament Saints and anoint them and they would do the works of God but they never were sons of God like God wanted them to be they never were Daughters of God like God wanted them to be they always had flaws they always had something that would get in their way so John come to do what he come to stand in between to introduce the fathers to the children at that time he introduced Jesus Christ Jesus Christ come had that life in him had to die to release that life and then that life came back on the book of Acts to Children the 3,000 downstairs now the 120 in the upper room they were we're going to get to that in just a second but they were at a different level because they had to come out and preach what Jesus preached the 3,000 downstairs heard one sermon and got converted because they knew some that this man Jesus Christ had come from heaven and died for their sins that was the basis so that's babies that's down here acts 238 brother rown said babbling babies and that's what they were they were speaking in tongues what does the baby do when the baby's little it rattles off and just starts it can't control itself and there a lot of things that it does but once that baby grows up and comes into a father his voice changes he can talk plain he doesn't do the thing the baby things that he used to do he doesn't make the mistakes that he used to do that he used to make so it he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children that was John the Baptist and the Heart of the children to their fathers now what is it this is the second part that's literally the part that the Prophet is bringing us brother brandham Jesus Christ through a man called William brandham bringing the heart of the children now back to that Pentecostal 1906 isza street that go back to them babbling babies again cuz we had to have a book of Acts John Christ on the scene book of Acts right then we had to come back in the end time and we had to see a book of acts had to happen again then we had a John the Baptist or the spirit and power of Elijah which was brother brandham coming to introduce Christ just like John introduced Christ to the world brother Bram introduced Christ to the world all right now everybody that's kind of that's slow and Elementary but we need to get that down because that's what this two- part is turn the heart of the fathers to the children John was bringing that Old Testament over to the New Testament now what was brother brandom doing he was taking the heart of those babbling little babies those Pentecostal babies back in 1906 where they couldn't control theel they'd stand up speaking tongues they do a lot of things they had gifts but sometimes they'd use them wrong I didn't say the gift was wrong they would use them wrong they use them in the wrong time brother Bram was trying to get those babies over now to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers the original Pentecost all right so lest I come and smite the Earth with a cur curse now see that lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse what Earth are we concerned about this ball of Earth or are we considered considering our own Earth you better consider your own Earth so I read that L lest God does something he's going to Smite this Earth with death what's the last curse the curse of sin is what death so we're all going to die unless we are turned back to these fathers that started this Pentecostal age back in ad33 ad30 everybody understand so far because see now let's brother brandom in the lay out of see Church age I keep fing with me cuz this is a good man see I got to where now I used to have to write a bunch of notes now I'm just preach off for one quote and I just leave us in my Bible and it'll give me a thought and I'll just go to preaching on it so the Lord sure does help us let to see in church a not uh 3:27 Church A's book now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 so he he he links the two together so he's not talking about John the Baptist he's talking about the Elijah in the end time this Elijah right is going to do two things one according to Mal Malachi 4 for he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers Pentecostal Babylon babies 1906 of street to the faith of the fathers where Paul and Peter and James and John and all those were standing at where they would say Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto thee arise out of your bed and W people were healed in the shadow of them passing by they believed those people so much because they acted like Christ so much they live literally knew they had been with Christ that's why they call them Christians they were called Christians in Antioch the Bible says because they had been with Christ they saw that in those people they saw enough in Peter to know that Peter had something that he didn't have before see they had all these virtues Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience God brother kind they had all that indwelled into them now what made them different they were with the word himself for 3 and 1/2 years they were with Jesus Christ he talked to them he told them things and the Bible says they held these things in their heart and they did not understand them but when the Holy Ghost fell on them on I mean on the day of Pentecost what happened all that became quickened they thought in their mind and they went back and they remembered what Jesus had told them and that all come back the holy spirit quickened all those three and 1/2 years and that put them where they weren't babbling babies Peter could stand on the day of Pentecost and say men and Brethren this is that spoken of by Joel The Prophet that this Jesus who youve crucified has been made both Lord and Christ in other words he's come down now in a group of people and we're ready to give it out to you and then somebody stands in the 3,000 and says well Bible says he was pricked in his heart in other words he said how can I have what you have what Peter say repent he say the message of the hour he said repent if you don't repent you don't believe the message of the hour all right repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost all right now so what brother brandom did this is where the big part in the me people in the message hold to this that from 1947 to 1963 you couldn't believe all that brother Brown said because God hadn't come to him that's a bunch of balone he was born a prophet when he was born again in the 20s he was a prophet with a born again experience all right and in 1933 God confirmed that by coming down on the Ohio River and telling the whole world that this man he didn't the no time did see people misquote that brother BR in no time ever says that that angel said you will forerun the second no always that says your message see that separates the message and the messenger right that makes it the days of the voice of the seventh angel all right he said your message will forerun the second coming of Christ not you right but now Elijah was in that man the spirit and power of Elijah was in brother brandom mhm to do what to be a vessel to be a conductor a trumpet that God could pick up and sound what he wanted all right and then he laid the trumpet down well what happened then the trumpet message now is what's taking us on to the Rapture but brother Bram from 1947 really to I say in 1960 when brother Brandon went across the curtain of time he saw the Saints and he saw the ones that had gone on and he asked that angel he said who are these people he said well there your convert and he said well did did Paul make it say now here's identification he said did Paul make it angel said sure Paul made it he said well I know I'll make it because I preached what Paul preached now what did Paul preach what was Paul in his Revelation he was right there at the faith of the father right so brother random to me was identifying to himself the angel was identifying to him saying hey you've made it back to that spot because see right after that he preached Act of a perfect man right after that he preaches foken word Original Seed so really he's moving his way up to that 1963 part to where we're going to get to now the messenger does two things so this messenger Malachi 4 doesn't just turn the heart of the Pentecostal babies to the fathers that's supposed to be the first thing we get see that's why we're living way past back everybody thinks we're way up in The Headstone forget it people if we don't act like the book of act act we hadn't made it to the book of Acts yet that's right that's right okay that don't mean we have to do signs and wonders every time we walk by Peter and James and them didn't either but when they needed God he was there now this message of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers does everybody understand that part brother Bram it the word had been eat down so by had in that Catholic age that fourth age till they almost killed all the Christians but when Luther came out he had just a little bit of light the just shall live by faith Wesley had a little bit more now we got to start cleaning oursel up all right Luther could smoke a pipe Wesley couldn't that's right all right see how God's moving up right then you got a Pentecostal age to where the Holy Ghost and the gifts came back on the church mhm right the Holy Ghost come himself in the fullness of the baptism that was the messenger of that age the oneeyed black man but it was the Holy Ghost in the man teaching the word of God but remember from 1906 to 1912 they still taught a father son Holy Ghost baptism they still taught a Trinity right even though the Holy Ghost fell on that winking at man's ignorance but about 192 the oneeyed black man started coming out and preaching that there was one true and living God Bishop Hayworth and all those Haywood come out if you'll read if you some of those songs that we sang if you'll look over there in the heading he wrote some of those like Mighty God is Jesus the prince of peace is he I think he wrote that song one of those he wrote himself they come down to the basis of one true and living God what God was moving up so in 1933 brother Ram comes on the scene still got a bunch of Babylon babies he's preaching and the women get up and start prophesying and speaking in tongues right in the middle of the service and and he has to call him down and he's trying to get the church calm down well what's he doing he's trying to take those Pentecostal babies just like it says here and bringing them up to the faith of the fathers again back to where Peter James John Paul and all those people were having all these virtues all these virtues got lost now it wasn't that the people were lost during that time they had the Holy Ghost in their soul but they didn't have the word of God in its truth and power to even teach these things things you got to have somebody get to that level before you can teach that level and there was nobody at that level even Luther and Wesley was not at they might have had some of these verses but they were not at the top of the pyramid where they could actually preach it to the people because remember you can go no higher than your messenger so brother randam had to be carried in 1960 back across a curtain of time he come back across and said he had preached what Paul preached and the angel verified that and the people verified that because they said we're resting on that all right but see that still did not conclude all of the prophet's message because if we did that then we have to go to another message and then we have to go to another piece of place of dying and we have to go to this and we have to go to that all right but we want to take a Rapture with the body change we better get back to something different than what they had in the ages because all those people that saw brother BR behind the curtain of time were Earthly dead they were in the grave their bodies in the grave brother Claude and I were talking yesterday and it's a real good point or Friday I guess it was a real good point that that was brought up between our conversation because in the Garden of Eden brother Brown said all of our bodies were in the Garden of Eden in the Earth all of our bodies were in this earth in the every man that ever Liv all right now what was God going to do his perfect plan was remember brother Brown talked about Adam body coming up out of the earth look like roots of a tree you know I mean he's making a point it's not literally Adam was a physical biological tree right but God brought those 16 elements together and made a man out of what the Earth that's right took that Genesis 126 and put it in that man right that's what God wanted to do now what's God doing now you and I are not being spoken out of the ground we're being permissive will we're being born by our parents by sex but that wasn't the original plan no but they eat out of the ground and that's what made you exactly the parents eat out of the ground and that's what made you that's my mother I'm getting to that okay so here comes Adam up out of the ground he I mean Genesis 126 goes into that man right that is a Son of God right correct that's a Son of God that's what God wanted now what happened let's just go through the plan then what happened Eve what happened to Eve she had her natural womb polluted but her womb up here was the first thing that got polluted then it just created the ACT where God could never do that until like I said about Genesis 3:15 the most important scripture in the in the in the Bible he's going to come without the male and female getting together now like they're having to all the way down through time and what's he going to do he's going to create that body out of what 16 elements but it's true like Mom said down Through the Ages they ate out of the same ground your body was still in this ground that's what I'm saying God's plan was not messed up at all it was just not that that man when it comes straight up out of the ground that that Genesis 126 went straight into that man that don't happen now what you have to do is you have to come through Mom and Daddy now through the beding ground come up and God knows you're going to accept it by predestination and then what does he do same thing that he wanted to do in the Garden of Eden here comes that Genesis 1 right into you at the new birth but the problem is here's the problem problem before the fall Adam was okay his body was being renewed he was not sinful okay it would have been changed see we were all going through go through a change anyway regardless I don't think God was going to raise up a Immortal body and then put that genes that's not what he done to Adam God can't change his mind about his plan that's right so Adam was in a body that was not Eternal yet but it would have been what changed in the moment in the twinking of a night and he would have become Eternal now what happened the devil stopped that from happening right so we brought sinful flesh up these bodies will die these bodies pass Adam see Even Adam died after he took on what his wife gave him he died a natural death right that's not what God wanted but now what's God going to do at the end time he's going to have two groups he's going to have the group that's going to stand that takes the chain that Genesis 126 man is going to be so real in that human manle it's going to change that very being but then you've got your people that are laying in the ground now what's going to happen to them their body's going to come out of the ground God's going to take that Genesis 1 from the sixth Dimension and bring it right back into that body and do the same thing you wanted to do to start with so Satan didn't stop God's plan God's plan still goes on and on and on he's going to have exactly what he wanted in the Garden of Eden he's going to have that exact plan at the end time but the prophet had to do two things and the reason he had to do two things is the first thing is that sinful body would still die now not saying that the person was sinful but the sinful body the sin curse the curse was still on all through these ages and the sin curse is still going on today we go to funerals so we know that even godly people are still dying right so that means that that person's not dead they're just laying the body back in the Earth where it came from right all right then there's a hole put on it that the real man goes in the sixth Dimension and then they come back together here right okay so they're not really dead they're just sleeping right all right God's putting them to rest but God required a group of people to be able to do like Adam would have done had it not been a fall was to stand in a place to where that his body would just be changed literally his atoms would be changed from falling down to Eternal so that's why this man of Malachi 4 had to do two things he had to restore the world back to the faith of the fathers 1960 6162 he was bringing it back God I don't say brother Brown God was bringing it back brother brand would always say not in the years of preparation now not saying that he was wrong no no no it took that Foundation to get you to this place all right see that's we've been 40 something years just just preaching Foundation let's be honest there's not a lot of people that's got all those Seven Virtues working in their life like Paul like Peter okay so it took 40 something years for us to even get a mindset when we can start thinking about it right but brother brandom did both those things while he was here he had to and then go off the scene and then in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery one mystery there's only one mystery left and that's the change of these bodies right right one mystery left how God can look at me and come from a sinful act not a sinful but but one that was allowed right but a sinful condition and then without dying I can just within a moment's notice be 20 years old and never have another pain never have another problem never have another hair Fallout and be totally Eternal that to me is a mystery yes all right now two he will reveal the th the mystery of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals so what is the seven Thunders it's a mystery of God that contained in Seven Seals that man never was able to look on remember brother randam had the dream remember he whipped the top off of that pyramid Mountain what was he doing he was knocking the top off looking down inside and he said man had never looked on this before but now they one man that was looking at it so we couldn't say that any longer brother Brandon when he whipped that top off see it became open right it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers literally and we preached on that before literally means it it's done just as is all right so this messenger of Malachi 4 he preached two messages from 47 to about 61 62 63 he was bringing a group of people he was bringing the word back into Power sure he was still going on the healing campaigns he was do all that but even the angel told him said that's not your that's not your message this is just a what bait on the hook to draw the people in to get the what the message not the healing sure thank God for the healing but see even here in Malachi see talking about him with healing in his wings in verse two you read the whole chapter see that's what a healing campaign had to come up first Malachi let's read it Malachi 1:2 but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing I'm sorry 14 14 shout the son of rightous shall arise with healing in his wings and ye now that makes it personal you shall go forth and grow up as cows with a stall what what does a cow do what do you do in a stall you store food why does a cow come to a stall because a stall is where the food is that's what God's telling you he's right here he's telling you that this that this Messengers going to come with a healing campaign and then ye shall go forth and grow up as cows with a stall brother brandham said he saw the vision of the food being stored up right so that's what happens the healing campaign come to get to people in to what the stored food and you shall grow up as Cales of stall and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this say the Lord remember ye the law of Moses my servant what the Ten Commandments remember the law of Moses so we're not doing away with the Old Testament we're not doing away with the New Testament we're not bringing some new doctrine brother brandham said you know somebody said about those seven Thunders he said brother brandham that's something that's not in the Bible you could write a 23rd Book of Revelation he said in other words he said they were trying to trap me but you go back to revelation 22 says if you add to this book or take away from this book you got problems so he said no he said it'll be what's in the book so the seven Thunders the Seven Seals everything we need for our journey on this Earth to change our body is inside that Bible that you hold in your hand it just took a messenger from God to come down to to deliver the pure word of God like it had never been preached before since Jesus was on the earth brother brandham literally preached the same three and A2 years that Jesus preached brother brandham didn't preach it in Parables yet it is in Parable John saw it in symol in Revelations 6 he didn't have the revelation of it brother brandham came and brought the Revelation to you and I and now what we're going to do is is we're going to that 47 to 63 is a foundation a lot of us have been in the message a good long time I assure you you'll know whether you got the foundation or not because you're the only one that knows it you know whether you're living right you know whether you're doing the right things because the first seal shows the mystery of iniquity iniquity is something that you're doing that you know you shouldn't do and you're doing it anyway if you can't get past that you're dead right this is life or death literally that's right so we're going to start I want you to bring your seal books with you and your Bibles for the next few months or weeks or years orever how long we' not got anywhere to go for the next few weeks so we'll get started we will start at Revelation 5 we'll probably start in the breach or somewhere in there but all right I don't have any notes yet so I'm just looking back over some old notes from a long time ago but um just keep it in prayer you wants to read just read read Revelations 5 and 6 read the the Revelations chapter 5 and chapter 6 in Wings be sorry Eagle age right absolutely that showed that eagle anointing where he would fly over and have a healing in his wings and then fly on over and be able to deliver the message cuz remember people we can't do away from 47 to 63 if you don't understand that then you can't get 63 to 6 okay go bless you
