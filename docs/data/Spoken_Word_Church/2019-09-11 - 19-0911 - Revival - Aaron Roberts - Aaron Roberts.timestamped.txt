[6:22] all these things to you in the name of
[6:24] Jesus Christ we pray amen we had Psalms
[6:28] 138 and it says verse seven says though
[6:31] I walk in the midst of the trouble thou
[6:33] shalt that will revive me thou shalt
[6:36] stretch forth thine hand against the
[6:38] wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand
[6:40] shall save me the Lord will perfect that
[6:44] which concern if me thy mercy O Lord
[6:48] endureth forever forsake not the works
[6:50] of thine own hands and into the book of
[6:54] Hosea book of Hosea chapter six very
[7:00] familiar reading and it says come and
[7:04] let us return unto the Lord for he hath
[7:07] torn and he will heal us he hath smitten
[7:11] and he will bind us up after two days he
[7:14] will revive us in the third day he will
[7:16] raise us up and we shall live in his
[7:19] sight there shall we know
[7:22] if we follow on to know the Lord his
[7:25] going forth is prepared as the morning
[7:27] he shall come unto us as the rain as the
[7:30] flatter and former rain unto the earth
[7:34] amen god bless you tonight you may be
[7:36] seated I want to speak on this and
[7:52] Webster defines revival as an actor
[7:55] instance of reviving the state of being
[7:57] revived such as renewed attention or
[8:00] interest in something a new presentation
[8:05] or publication of something old a period
[8:09] of renewed religious interest and often
[8:12] highly emotional evangelistic meeting or
[8:14] series of meetings restoration of force
[8:16] validity or effect such as to a contract
[8:22] and then continued own revive which is
[8:27] that state of being revived revived
[8:29] means to restore to consciousness or
[8:32] life to restore from a depressed
[8:35] inactive or unused state to bring back
[8:38] or to renew in the mind or memory and
[8:43] that's what I want to look at tonight
[8:45] where it says to renew in the mind
[8:49] because Romans 12:2 says it says but
[8:54] being a bee I beseech you therefore
[8:56] brethren by the mercies of God that you
[8:58] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[8:59] holy and acceptable unto God which is
[9:01] your reasonable service and be not
[9:03] conformed to this world but be ye
[9:05] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[9:07] that you may prove what is that good and
[9:09] acceptable and perfect will of God and
[9:14] just just laying up a little bit of
[9:17] background here this is from questions
[9:19] and answer 1957 and brother branham's
[9:22] talking about Israel and he said and he
[9:27] shows Israel and he says did you know
[9:30] that that Jewish flag is the oldest flag
[9:32] in the world and it's been laying
[9:34] dormant for 2,000 years more
[9:36] yeah about 2500 years a Jewish flag that
[9:38] 6-point Star of David never flowed for
[9:41] 2500 years since the carrying away of
[9:43] babbling and now because the Rimmer
[9:45] Roman Empire took them over and the
[9:48] Messiah come and they rejected it and
[9:50] they was scattered to the four winds on
[9:52] the earth but did you know on May the 6
[9:54] 1946 that flag come back over Jerusalem
[9:57] again did you know on May the 7th 1946
[10:01] the angel of the Lord appeared to me the
[10:03] next day up here and sent me into the
[10:06] world to bring forth a revival for the
[10:08] very next morning when that flag raised
[10:11] in Jerusalem as the going down of the
[10:13] Sun that afternoon the angel the Lord
[10:15] appeared here in the United States at
[10:17] the same time when you see the fig tree
[10:19] and the rest of the trees putting forth
[10:22] brother Branham continues on and he says
[10:31] how many remembers this is continuation
[10:35] of questions answers brother I says how
[10:38] many remembers the the star going down
[10:41] here hanging down here at the Ohio River
[10:44] many years ago when he said here's a
[10:46] picture of it here yet when he come down
[10:49] and said your message will go forth as a
[10:51] forerunner for the second coming just
[10:53] like John went forth as a forerunner for
[10:55] the first coming and look around the
[10:57] world has swept the revival tens of
[10:59] thousands times thousands and thousands
[11:02] and a great revival and he said all the
[11:05] legalists and all the different ones
[11:06] around all over the world in the big
[11:08] churches you know said the Billy day
[11:10] Sunday days are over but when they sing
[11:13] the church began to revive the common
[11:15] people they had to save there they had
[11:19] to save their face
[11:20] Charles fuller would have taken the
[11:22] place but he was too old and they went
[11:24] with Billy Graham and God took Billy
[11:26] Graham where the method or the Baptist
[11:28] Church did and they did all and they all
[11:30] got around him and Billy Graham's not
[11:32] half the preacher that brother Neville
[11:34] is so as far as being a preacher no no
[11:36] by no means but what is it they had to
[11:39] do it it's organism and everything right
[11:42] around it gathering around Billy says
[11:44] the same thing see they had to do it and
[11:47] it had to be done to fulfill the Word of
[11:49] God
[11:50] they didn't have the spirit to rally
[11:52] around so they had to take the word to
[11:55] rally around so they did and Billy's a
[11:58] word preacher and a dandy and they
[11:59] rallied around so that put all the cold
[12:03] formals in their rally and the
[12:05] supernatural being this divine healing
[12:08] and powers and working and so forth by
[12:10] the miracles of God put this the church
[12:13] the rapture bride here that's got the
[12:16] all in her lamp put her in a revival
[12:18] seat and the cold formal church had its
[12:21] revival and here's Israel turning with
[12:24] their revival so we're looking at a
[12:27] revival and you know many times we talk
[12:30] about the bride's revival but I wanted I
[12:35] wanted to see I want you show that
[12:37] everybody's got a revival everybody's
[12:40] having their own revival and the revival
[12:44] is for the different groups whatever
[12:49] group you're in because the word has
[12:53] come to each group and as we were
[12:59] reading here in the scripture you know
[13:02] God promised the word to be revealed and
[13:05] there was going to be a revival take
[13:07] place and it was he was speaking of a
[13:09] prophecy but you know each one of each
[13:12] group has their own revival but you know
[13:15] the thing is is you know why do we have
[13:18] as brother Matthew was speaking saying
[13:21] why do we have the things that are
[13:23] taking place why because the word has to
[13:25] be full filled and so there's a word to
[13:28] everybody you know the thing is is
[13:30] people act like they're not that they
[13:32] don't understand what's going on but you
[13:34] know what it doesn't matter where you at
[13:36] or what you're doing you're gonna
[13:37] fulfill a part of the word you're going
[13:40] to fulfill a part of the word for your
[13:41] day because there was a day because just
[13:45] like he was he was speaking see when the
[13:47] Holy Ghost came there was a message
[13:50] coming in the end time that was going to
[13:53] that was going to be fulfilled because
[13:54] all of the prophecies in the scripture
[13:56] was speaking of the word coming to
[13:58] Israel and Israel coming back that fig
[14:00] tree is going to blossom again and all
[14:03] those
[14:04] place but see that was speaking one
[14:06] because it was spoke of that God was had
[14:08] not turned her away from its whatever
[14:10] that he was coming back to bring the
[14:12] word back to him but there was a bride
[14:14] in the last day that was going to
[14:15] receive a word he was coming back to
[14:17] speak to an endtime group that he was
[14:20] going to make known those things that
[14:21] were that were spoken of in the
[14:23] scripture but the thing is just like the
[14:26] reason I wanted to read that scripture
[14:27] or the Rideau quote from brother Branham
[14:29] because he talks about there was a group
[14:31] that was on fire that had the Holy Ghost
[14:33] that had the oil in their lamp that was
[14:35] given for them for that day that was the
[14:38] endtime bride to had to receive a
[14:39] revival but there was a still a group
[14:42] out there that was just normal and dead
[14:44] and powerless and lifeless but there was
[14:47] a word for their day and that's going to
[14:48] be their revival but because we see that
[14:51] as brother Brennan was speaking of we
[14:53] see in the end time that we know what
[14:55] was going to take places the World
[14:57] Council of Churches and they're all
[14:59] going to gather together the tears are
[15:01] coming together one because that's their
[15:02] fulfillment of their word that's the
[15:04] word that God spoke them because they're
[15:06] not going to receive the true word
[15:08] they're not going to receive the life of
[15:10] Jesus Christ they're not gonna say
[15:11] receive the word for their hour because
[15:13] God come and he spoke to him but you
[15:15] know what it's not because God didn't
[15:17] make it known to him it's because they
[15:19] rejected it and you know what it's the
[15:22] same for you and I God has given us the
[15:25] word but it's our opportunity it's our
[15:27] right to reject it or accept it God has
[15:31] given us that opportunity giving us that
[15:33] privilege and so it has to be do you are
[15:36] you under the revival of this message
[15:39] are you just going to be as a revival or
[15:42] just them just rallying around and just
[15:45] being lifeless and powerless and many
[15:53] people you know it's it's not just the
[15:55] denominations but it's the
[15:57] denominational spirit that's inside the
[15:59] message today why because people if you
[16:02] don't have if you don't have the place
[16:04] the place to stand if you don't have a
[16:06] short foundation to stand on if you
[16:09] don't have a revelation of the word a
[16:11] word you're supposed to stand then how
[16:13] are you supposed to go anywhere well
[16:15] because there's so many that are they
[16:17] walk in darkness they're so afraid they
[16:20] don't know what to do and the problem is
[16:22] is they don't know how to release the
[16:25] hold on themselves and just allow the
[16:28] Holy Spirit to get ahold of them and
[16:30] really just turn it over to God and
[16:32] allow God to do a work in their life
[16:35] well because there's so many people as
[16:38] brother Bram said it's it was all cold
[16:39] and formal it's all intellectual and
[16:42] there's so many people that that is all
[16:44] it's wrapped up in this message it's
[16:45] cold formal intellectual listen and you
[16:48] know the thing is is is you see people
[16:51] and you know they want to study the the
[16:53] message and listen to the message but
[16:55] you the thing is is there there's so
[16:58] much of it that people have had to lay
[16:59] aside because they can't they can't walk
[17:02] walk the same way that they're walking
[17:04] today and hold to the word but see
[17:10] that's what you have to take is to
[17:17] receive all the word take all that God
[17:22] has for us in this hour you know because
[17:26] it's so said that you see all the things
[17:29] that have taken place and all the things
[17:31] that God is trying to do and make
[17:33] yourself known and I believe he did and
[17:36] through a prophet that he made itself
[17:38] and opened the word but the thing is is
[17:40] you've got to come before God and ask
[17:43] and pray for Revelation and yeah the
[17:48] thing is is how do you how do you pray
[17:50] for Revelation you know because the one
[17:52] thing that you've got to do is you've
[17:53] got to understand I don't know it you've
[17:56] got to come to a place it's just like
[17:58] when you come to a place of salvation
[17:59] you've got to realize that you're lost
[18:02] you got to come to a place that you've
[18:04] got that you can't do anything for
[18:06] yourself and somebody's got to do it for
[18:08] you
[18:09] well because you know what we can't save
[18:12] ourselves we can't do anything for
[18:13] ourselves why because we are so lost and
[18:16] alienated from God and separated from
[18:19] God God has to do something in our lives
[18:21] you've got to come to a place and
[18:23] realize you know that you're a sinner
[18:24] and God is the one that come to save you
[18:27] you didn't come seeking God he come to
[18:30] seek you and he come to save you and he
[18:32] come to bring you to his life to bring
[18:35] you to eternal life and if he's coming
[18:38] to bring us then then you know we gotta
[18:40] understand it takes God to do that and
[18:42] you know the thing is we've got to come
[18:44] to a place that just like just like when
[18:46] Jeremiah went to the to the potter's
[18:48] house and he said you know he saw that
[18:49] clay being put on the wheel and the
[18:51] wheel began to spin and the Potter had
[18:53] total control over the clay and he
[18:56] didn't have to you know the Potter
[18:58] wasn't worried about the clay why
[19:00] because that he knew what he was going
[19:02] to do he had it under control he had
[19:04] know what he had in his mind and the
[19:05] thing is is the Potter had had to do the
[19:08] work but the clay had to stay there you
[19:12] know it's the same way with you and I we
[19:14] wonder how God's going to do something
[19:15] in our lives well you know what if we
[19:17] just stay on the wheel and you know way
[19:18] we allow him to do the work and we quit
[19:20] trying to figure things out on our home
[19:22] and worry about things then you know
[19:24] what he can do the work in our lives but
[19:27] we have so many people today they're so
[19:28] concerned about other things and you
[19:30] know and I'm just I'm just gonna I'm
[19:34] just gonna say it because you know you
[19:37] see these people and they live in a
[19:38] world of fear it's a world of fear that
[19:45] people live in one because they're so
[19:48] uncertain about things and they don't
[19:50] understand things and you know what
[19:52] Jesus is the answer to all your
[19:54] questions but you know the thing is is
[19:58] people they get to this one place but
[20:01] they can't understand that it takes a
[20:03] ministry you know you see these people
[20:06] and and y'all probably know what I'm
[20:09] talking about but I'm just gonna go
[20:10] ahead and say it there's there's people
[20:12] that in this world and in and around
[20:15] this message and they want to listen and
[20:18] they won't brother branham to be the one
[20:21] that's going to lead them and they can't
[20:23] realize that it's going to take flesh
[20:25] and blood it's going to take a five fold
[20:27] ministry it's gonna take men with faults
[20:31] and failures and human frailty and God's
[20:34] gonna speak through them and he's gonna
[20:36] speak the word of redemption
[20:39] to them but the problem is as they can't
[20:41] they can't not trust that God can do
[20:43] that and you know brother Reynolds said
[20:46] God men is always always looked back and
[20:49] so praise God for what he done in the
[20:50] past and he said what God's gonna do in
[20:53] the future but they're missing what
[20:54] God's doing right now
[20:59] God why because right now is God God is
[21:02] moving right now is God's revival on the
[21:05] bride the bride is having a revival but
[21:08] people don't realize that why because
[21:14] you know what it's not a show it's not
[21:17] known to the public if it doesn't take
[21:25] if it's not if the Holy Ghost doesn't
[21:27] show it to you then you're what you'll
[21:28] not see it but you're there so many
[21:32] people and then and you know and another
[21:34] case is is you know it takes it takes
[21:37] each individual person having a
[21:41] experience and experience on their own a
[21:44] personal experience they've got to have
[21:46] a personal revelation for themselves
[21:49] because if you don't it doesn't really
[21:51] matter it doesn't really matter if you
[21:56] were related to brother Branham or not
[21:58] he doesn't really matter who your pastor
[22:00] is it doesn't reminder who your mom and
[22:02] daddy are they don't matter what you've
[22:04] done in this world and all the great
[22:06] things the thing is is if you've not had
[22:08] a revelation if you've not had a birth
[22:10] of your own to put you in the body so
[22:12] Jesus Christ can come and live in you
[22:14] and lead and guide you it doesn't really
[22:16] matter they tell you the world's full of
[22:23] religious people this message is full of
[22:26] religious people
[22:27] I mean it's overflowing with religion
[22:30] but the problem is is there's no life
[22:34] the thing is it takes people to come on
[22:37] the scene and you know because you know
[22:39] if we could see right like that little
[22:41] say that if we could see what's taking
[22:43] place then you know what it would drive
[22:45] us more to that you know we would have a
[22:48] desperation to get to that
[22:51] as brother brown said if we could see
[22:53] what's going on right here today and see
[22:55] the angels of God here ministering you
[22:59] know they're sending a descending to you
[23:01] to bring you the word to forgot to use
[23:04] flesh and blood to come to you and open
[23:09] your eyes and speak to you then you know
[23:13] what then we would have more I have more
[23:16] time for it we it would be a higher
[23:18] priority well because many times and see
[23:21] that's what Satan has come to do he's
[23:23] come to take up all your time
[23:26] to get into your mind and hinder you and
[23:28] the problem is is you've got to overcome
[23:31] that you've got to fight that because if
[23:34] you're not fighting that then though
[23:35] Devils winning pasilla takes it takes a
[23:41] everyday battle every day you get up but
[23:44] if you realize and you have to go back
[23:46] it's like David you know David had to
[23:49] encouraged himself in the Lord
[23:51] why because sometimes that's the only
[23:53] person that's around is you and you know
[23:56] what you got to dig in the word for
[23:58] yourself and find a holding place and
[24:00] get your own revival and all of a sudden
[24:05] you know what if the word comes to you
[24:06] then you know what if and nobody else is
[24:08] going through then you know what there's
[24:10] a revival taking place in you you know
[24:15] that's the reason that when Daniel
[24:17] Daniel went to the window and you know
[24:19] they said you can't pray you can't pray
[24:22] to your God you've got to pray and do
[24:23] our form and our religious program you
[24:29] know Daniel said he didn't matter he had
[24:34] it had his own plan and you know what
[24:37] the next day he done exactly the same
[24:39] thing he's ever I always done he didn't
[24:42] change his plan he didn't change the way
[24:44] he done everything you know he didn't he
[24:47] didn't sneak around and say well they
[24:48] won't find me up here on top of the
[24:50] house her in the basement or someplace
[24:51] you know he went to the window and let
[24:53] everybody know why because you know what
[24:57] if something stirs inside of you then
[24:59] it's got to be manifested
[25:05] just like the just like that Samaritan
[25:10] woman you know brother Ram said did you
[25:13] know you know Jesus coming and was
[25:19] speaking to her one day and you know
[25:20] what through her testimony said the
[25:22] whole city had a revival and that's what
[25:29] it takes
[25:32] and here in in Hosea chapter 6 it says
[25:37] after two days he will revive us in the
[25:39] third day he will he will raise us up
[25:41] and we shall live in his sight he says
[25:45] then we shall we know if we follow on to
[25:48] know the Lord his going forth is
[25:51] prepared as in the morning so after you
[25:54] are revived then you know what you must
[25:57] continue on to know the Lord because
[26:02] people you know his brother bran was
[26:04] saying you know the Pentecostals they
[26:06] had their revival but they didn't
[26:07] realize there's a further manifestation
[26:10] of the word there was a furtherance of
[26:11] the word and you stop and they stopped
[26:14] but he said you know now you must
[26:15] continue on because you know what there
[26:17] is a greater thing to continue on he
[26:21] said then he shall raise up and we shall
[26:23] live in his sight and we'll get into
[26:26] that a little bit later but we shall
[26:28] know and follow to know the Lord so
[26:30] there's a continuation that we must
[26:32] continue to follow in the Lord because
[26:35] to be revived is to renew in the mind in
[26:39] the memory to undergo back and look
[26:42] because one of the one of the
[26:43] definitions was to go back to the things
[26:45] that were old to go back to those things
[26:49] that were spoken of as Peter said he
[26:52] said stir up your pure mind in a way of
[26:54] remembrance these things that you've
[26:56] heard you've been stirred up but now you
[26:59] know there's many times that we hear and
[27:01] we see these things but you know all of
[27:02] a sudden it takes something it takes the
[27:04] Holy Ghost to quicken it you know
[27:07] I wish I could almost write a book
[27:09] sometimes of the things that I have read
[27:12] of the prophet of reading of
[27:16] takes a ministry he took a minister
[27:19] behind the pulpit to speak on the exact
[27:21] same thing and all of a sudden it's like
[27:23] did I read that I've had to go back and
[27:27] read it again you know years ago brother
[27:31] Dale preached on the book of Romans
[27:33] chapter 8 and you know and I and I tell
[27:36] everybody ever since that time their
[27:37] brother Dale preached on that I said I
[27:38] can never read Romans 8 the same way
[27:40] anymore
[27:41] why because there was an opening of the
[27:43] world that I never see it the same way
[27:46] why because I couldn't remember what it
[27:48] was like to read it when it was closed
[27:50] they was veiled there was nothing I mean
[27:52] I was reading the same words but all of
[27:55] a sudden now it's open I remember years
[27:59] ago brother Harold Hildebrandt preached
[28:01] it was a I saw a video of him preaching
[28:04] it brother Donnie and he preached on the
[28:07] masterpiece just got finished reading
[28:09] that message I had just read the book
[28:11] and brother didn't Hildebrandt's
[28:13] preaching on that and I stopped then I
[28:14] had to say is that in there and so on we
[28:18] got the book and I'm reading the same
[28:19] thing and you know what some of it I
[28:21] actually highlighted there was things I
[28:22] was reading then you know what all of a
[28:23] sudden brother brain was bringing it out
[28:25] and it was like man it's a brand-new
[28:26] book one because all of a sudden it
[28:29] takes he takes the Holy Ghost but see
[28:32] the problem is is people can't put their
[28:33] faith in a man but you're not gonna put
[28:35] your faith in a man what because yeah
[28:39] it's not me it's not brother Dale snow
[28:42] by the way snow brother Bob's gone
[28:43] brother lease it's not any other brother
[28:47] one because it's a gift of God that's in
[28:49] our lives that we can use but it takes
[28:51] you to operate the gift but the thing is
[28:54] it's the Holy Ghost that does the work I
[29:00] tell you many times I you know I don't
[29:02] know about these other brothers but you
[29:04] know people people ask how do you get a
[29:05] sermon well you know what I I don't have
[29:10] any I don't have any certain way of
[29:11] getting a sermon now some brothers they
[29:15] can say hey I've got them sermon and
[29:17] I'll get to it in three five seven weeks
[29:18] whatever 10 10 months from now whatever
[29:21] I got stuff I'm really I'm really it's
[29:26] all scattered I mean some of y'all some
[29:30] of y'all brothers
[29:30] may notice I study on something I'll put
[29:32] it up and I don't know I won't look at
[29:34] it for months and that's like I get this
[29:37] thought I start working on it and then
[29:38] it only come so far and it's just like
[29:40] it just stops so I just put it on the
[29:42] shelf like well I'll come back to that
[29:43] and then sometimes I come to church and
[29:45] people say boy that was so good I really
[29:47] enjoyed that brother and Psyche oh
[29:48] that's been sitting on the shelf or
[29:50] eight months half-finished but it you
[29:53] know it's just like you catch a thought
[29:55] you put it together some things and then
[29:56] they just and at other times how do you
[29:59] get a sermon you get a sermon the day
[30:02] the day of Wednesday night you can study
[30:06] you can pray and God won't give you
[30:07] enough you don't get nothing and all of
[30:09] a sudden on the just about on the way to
[30:11] church
[30:12] you get everything comes together and
[30:15] you know it does right try you do
[30:18] anything you know what and people people
[30:20] think it's easy it's not and sometimes
[30:23] you know what it takes it takes the
[30:25] leading of the Lord and you got to trust
[30:27] the Lord for him to give you something
[30:29] to say because you know there's so I
[30:31] don't know about the rest of you but I'm
[30:32] just I'm just talking tonight I'm just
[30:34] speaking from my heart let me tell you
[30:35] there's been plenty times I got in the
[30:37] truck card come church on Wednesday
[30:39] night and I tell you what I think boy if
[30:42] somebody else to preach I'd say Amen
[30:46] because you know what I turn it over to
[30:48] somebody else it is everyone because you
[30:52] you come up here and you think man I
[30:53] that's this is gonna flop and you think
[30:57] I don't know what am I gonna do tonight
[30:58] and all of a sudden all I said you get
[31:01] up here next thing you know the Lord
[31:02] starts moving and all of a sudden you
[31:04] think you know what it calls that it's
[31:05] not me and you know what it's the same
[31:10] way with you you get to the place in
[31:12] your life when you get your when you're
[31:14] back against the wall or you run out of
[31:16] your ideas or your plans or or whatever
[31:19] else you think well I don't know what
[31:20] I'm going to do well you know what then
[31:22] that's when God can take over because
[31:24] you get to the point where you're
[31:25] allowing him to move because you get to
[31:28] the place that you realize that's not
[31:30] you you get yourselves out of the way
[31:33] and then God can speak as I tell you
[31:40] I know and I tell people you know people
[31:45] people think it's kind of funny but you
[31:47] get up here sometimes and you don't have
[31:49] anything in there no so all of a sudden
[31:51] the Lord gives you something to say and
[31:52] you start saying it and you surprise
[31:54] yourself what comes out of your mouth
[31:55] and you think boy that was good and you
[31:59] realize you know what it's not it's not
[32:00] you it's God God's the one that does the
[32:04] speaking those Jesus told us he said not
[32:10] to take a thought what you're gonna say
[32:13] you won because he said in that hour he
[32:14] said the Lord will give you your father
[32:17] will give you what you what has to be
[32:19] said what needs to be said and so that's
[32:21] the same way it is when you come to the
[32:23] house of God because you know what it
[32:26] doesn't have to be in my notes it
[32:28] doesn't have to be something I studied
[32:30] on you know the thing is we just get in
[32:33] one in one mind and in one Accord if we
[32:37] come in and we get everything out of the
[32:39] way then you know what we come and sit
[32:41] in heavenly places then you know what
[32:42] God will come and speak to us and the
[32:46] problem is is do we come have we
[32:48] gathered in heavenly places tonight have
[32:50] you come in expecting to receive from
[32:53] God because you know I just come up here
[32:55] and saying Lord I don't want to waste
[32:57] the people's time I want the people to
[32:58] be blessed but you know the thing is is
[33:00] I have to get out of my out of the way
[33:03] Lord do whatever it takes because I want
[33:05] to see the people blessed I want to see
[33:06] the people prosper in the word I want
[33:09] somebody to get on overcoming tonight I
[33:11] want somebody to get deliverance tonight
[33:13] whatever it is that you have need of and
[33:16] you know the first time I ever window it
[33:19] preached outside of them side of my home
[33:22] church I was I told the people when I
[33:25] got up to preach he was a young it was a
[33:27] youth meeting I got up to preach and he
[33:29] said brother Frank Raiders church and I
[33:31] told the people I said I'm as nervous as
[33:33] a long-tailed cat in a room full of
[33:35] rocking chairs I mean I was I was
[33:38] sweating bullets and I got up but you
[33:40] know what there was a sister in the back
[33:43] and she told me after church she said
[33:44] brother
[33:45] she said the Lord come and healed me
[33:46] while you were preaching and so you know
[33:48] that's what it takes it takes the word
[33:51] but it takes God do this do that work
[33:53] it's not us
[33:54] because you know the thing is there's
[33:56] too many people that want everybody to
[33:58] to look at me it's it's me and mine and
[34:01] I know it's none of that it's God and
[34:05] many times people people have got their
[34:07] own on the on the ministry and and it's
[34:10] not that where it's not in the eyes of
[34:13] the ministry it's in the eyes of God
[34:16] that we're supposed to be looking and
[34:17] see that God works through the ministry
[34:20] you know people want to put their pastor
[34:23] on the pedestal well you know what that
[34:25] is that is the a disgrace to God and
[34:28] Jesus Christ and the word to put your
[34:31] pastor on a pedestal because you know
[34:37] what
[34:38] there ain't no there ain't no past ain't
[34:39] no Shepherd in the world trying to
[34:41] trying to Shepherd sheep stand on top of
[34:44] a rock you ain't never seen you never
[34:48] seen a shepherd up on the mountain and
[34:50] all the sheet down there no he live
[34:52] brother and said he lives with the Sheep
[34:54] he sleeps with the Sheep he goes through
[34:56] everything with the Sheep he's there
[34:59] with the Sheep well you know what you
[35:00] can't have them you can't see God you
[35:02] can't see God move in your life when it
[35:04] all you got is you've got your pastor in
[35:07] between you and God and you know what
[35:10] you can't get anywhere if you've got
[35:11] brother Brandon between you and God if
[35:14] you've got oh you can see his brother
[35:16] branham and you know you got a brother
[35:18] branham on this pedestal well you know
[35:20] what we honor
[35:21] we honor brother Brandon we honor the
[35:23] ministry that comes in but you know what
[35:24] you know what it would it would break
[35:26] brother branham's heart I think brother
[35:28] Brandon would be very disappointed if
[35:30] they heartbroken to see the people that
[35:32] have turned and have their eyes on him
[35:34] and not on Jesus Christ he said you're
[35:39] not feeding on the seventh angel
[35:41] messenger he said but you're feeding on
[35:43] the unfailing body word of the Son of
[35:44] Man that's who he was trying to point
[35:47] the people to he wants you to feed on
[35:49] Christ he said he said you become the
[35:54] word as you received the word well the
[35:56] thing is is what
[35:57] places we become Christ's brother Brent
[36:00] said she is him that we become the word
[36:07] not son not some tunas not some other
[36:10] idea not something else but we become
[36:12] him we are we are the manifestation of
[36:17] the word in this hour which is Jesus
[36:19] Christ this is from first John chapter 1
[36:30] the scripture says John first John 1:1
[36:33] says that which was from the beginning
[36:35] which we have heard which we have seen
[36:38] with our eyes which we have looked upon
[36:40] and our hands have handled of the word
[36:42] of life for the life was manifested and
[36:45] we have seen it and bear witness and
[36:47] show unto you that eternal life which
[36:51] was with the father and was manifested
[36:53] unto us that which we have seen and
[36:56] heard declare we unto you that we that
[37:00] ye also may have fellowship with us and
[37:03] truly our Fellowship is with the father
[37:05] and with his son Jesus Christ and these
[37:09] things right we unto you that your joy
[37:11] may be full
[37:13] this then is the message which we have
[37:15] heard of him and declare unto you that
[37:17] God is light in him is no darkness at
[37:20] all so see the thing is it's John's
[37:24] writing about what he has seen in the
[37:26] things at here because you know he
[37:27] actually saw Jesus he actually handled
[37:30] Jesus he slept with Jesus he went
[37:32] through all these things but you know
[37:33] what he's speaking of a greater thing
[37:35] that took place one because you know
[37:37] what you're not going to fellowship with
[37:39] Jesus and the friend of flesh as John
[37:42] did you're not going to see him those
[37:44] things but he's wanting you to see that
[37:46] the life that was in Jesus Christ came
[37:48] into him because it was spoken of and he
[37:51] became into him and he said these are
[37:53] the things that we have handled it's not
[37:55] that we handle the flesh but we've seen
[37:57] the Word of God one because we've tasted
[37:59] our the good heavenly gifts because
[38:00] we've received the word we received
[38:03] Jesus not as a flash man but as the word
[38:08] and that's how we're gonna have
[38:09] fellowship with Jesus it's through the
[38:11] word and you know what because they
[38:13] become so real to us and then all of a
[38:19] sudden then you realize you know what
[38:21] then you have brothers and sisters that
[38:23] are Jesus Christ made manifest see we
[38:28] are this is the word that we've handled
[38:29] this is the word that we've received
[38:31] this is the fellowship that we have he
[38:40] said that God is light and him there is
[38:42] no darkness at all program says
[38:46] continuing on brother brems says in
[38:48] pardonable sin he said you know revival
[38:50] means to revive that which is our that
[38:53] our that's already converted see them
[38:57] that's already converts see it's a
[39:00] revival needs to revive to bring back to
[39:02] make life again in the church sometimes
[39:04] we get just a little slack but then he
[39:08] goes on and talking about them said but
[39:10] we're looking for one of those old time
[39:12] like we used to have a long time ago
[39:15] so sometimes you know it's to revive
[39:17] what you already have what you've
[39:19] already heard what you've handled that
[39:21] that's what is to be revived that's a
[39:24] revival that's taking place it's to hold
[39:27] on to the things that you've heard and
[39:29] and then he said you know because we get
[39:31] a little slack well because sometimes it
[39:34] you know because we allow things to
[39:37] happen in our lives where it becomes a
[39:39] little common he thinks that things
[39:41] happen to us where where we don't
[39:43] realize we don't have the fellowship
[39:45] that we had with him before one because
[39:47] we allow the things of like the cares of
[39:49] life get in the way the battle the
[39:51] battles that we face and you know those
[39:55] things get in our way but you know
[39:57] that's the one God wants us to come to
[39:59] these things this is from the
[40:03] impersonation of Christianity 1957
[40:06] brother I'm says now if we if God meant
[40:09] for us to run his church if but if God
[40:13] meant for us to run his church by
[40:15] denominations or her Creed's the only
[40:17] thing we need is the intelligence of a
[40:20] man the
[40:21] martyrdom and better the church but
[40:23] that's what's not God's program God's
[40:25] program was for the Holy Ghost to run
[40:28] the church the Holy Ghost was given for
[40:32] the church and we can't have two
[40:34] faculties running the church at the same
[40:36] time if man runs it the Holy Ghost goes
[40:39] out if the Holy Ghost runs it usually
[40:42] the man goes out so it's just one or the
[40:45] other so we must come to this conclusion
[40:47] that God intends the Holy Spirit to run
[40:49] the church now I don't mean just the
[40:51] spirit gets up and preaches because the
[40:54] Holy Spirit sets people in the church
[40:56] for certain things and then he continues
[41:03] on he said and he's talking about
[41:07] changing things and you know the things
[41:09] that we do he said it doesn't mean that
[41:11] the church needs a face lifting he said
[41:13] that isn't what the church needs it
[41:15] needs the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[41:17] it needs the power of the Living God a
[41:19] revival doesn't mean to go out and get
[41:22] new members a revival means to revive
[41:24] that what you've already got so that's
[41:29] what we have to have is we have to have
[41:31] a revival of what's been given to us and
[41:36] you know many people in the scripture
[41:37] you know all through the scripture you
[41:39] will see where people actually had the
[41:41] word and listen to the word and held the
[41:44] word and spoke of the word and they
[41:45] failed to realize what was taking place
[41:47] in their hour but same thing is it you
[41:54] hold on to what what he said because
[41:58] it's just like the two going to on the
[42:01] road to Emmaus you know they held the
[42:03] word and it was it was them talking
[42:05] about Jesus to Jesus and they didn't
[42:08] even Rin and they didn't even realize
[42:09] who he was he said who why are y'all so
[42:13] sad and you know they certainly you're
[42:15] are you a stranger and you don't know
[42:16] these things that's taking place and
[42:17] talking about the Ministry of Jesus and
[42:19] everything and tell him all about it how
[42:22] sweet we thought he was going to be the
[42:23] one to take over and all these great
[42:25] things and all the great things that
[42:26] Jesus done and all the things and then
[42:28] Jesus began to expand to him the
[42:30] scripture right what he took them back
[42:34] to the old test
[42:35] and he started to expound the scripture
[42:37] Oh bulls so apart he said here's the
[42:39] here's what the scripture said isn't
[42:41] didn't Jesus fulfilled the one that you
[42:43] speaking of didn't he fulfill these
[42:45] scriptures isn't this what he said he
[42:47] was gonna do that is didn't the
[42:49] scriptures say that he had the comedy
[42:51] would be the one that would die and then
[42:53] he would rise again all the things that
[42:56] he would do now here here they are
[42:58] expounding to him and they're so sad
[42:59] they're like well you I guess so I don't
[43:03] know I don't know what they were doing
[43:05] because here they here they were
[43:06] speaking of the word in the words being
[43:09] spoke to them and you know what they're
[43:11] not catching that the word is being
[43:13] fulfilled and he's even telling them
[43:16] listen this is what was going to take
[43:17] place here it is the third day and Jesus
[43:20] told you he said tear down this temple
[43:22] in three days I'll raise it up again
[43:24] and here it is the third day and you
[43:25] know what if you actually believed
[43:27] actually called what was going on you
[43:29] wouldn't be walking down the road with
[43:30] your head hung down you'd be at the tone
[43:32] looking you'd be looking to see why
[43:37] because and the scripture tells us you
[43:39] know that the women on the first day of
[43:43] the week the women went to the tomb and
[43:47] here they are taking their spices one
[43:50] because they're going to prepare the
[43:51] body here's their here's their mind and
[43:54] the Bible tells us that in their mind
[43:56] there's like who's going to move the to
[43:58] the stone from the tomb one because this
[44:03] the stone was still there well who's
[44:04] gonna move it so we can do this we don't
[44:07] know what Jesus total here I'm not gonna
[44:09] be here that long
[44:11] don't don't make no long plans I know
[44:14] I'm not gonna be here I'm just gonna be
[44:15] here for a short time to fulfill the
[44:17] word and then I'm coming up I'm coming
[44:19] out I'm not gonna be there but here they
[44:22] are wondering who's gonna move the stone
[44:24] and all of a sudden they were astonished
[44:25] when they got there and realized the
[44:27] stone had already been moved why because
[44:29] he was not there and then when the
[44:31] angels came and told him listen he told
[44:34] you that he was raised he said he's not
[44:36] here but he's risen just like he told
[44:38] you he was gonna do
[44:41] he took a took a supernatural happening
[44:44] and then all of a sudden they ran back
[44:46] to tell the rest of them and you know
[44:48] what the rest of them didn't believe
[44:49] evening Peter and John's I know that
[44:52] can't be well he's the one who told you
[44:54] I was going to take place I mean he live
[44:58] with him
[44:59] you you fished with him all those
[45:00] different things and all these things
[45:02] and you can't believe that he can do
[45:03] this one thing you said you saw where he
[45:08] stood before the Pharisees and the
[45:09] Sadducees and tell them to search the
[45:11] scripture and play and take my life and
[45:14] the things that my ministry and the
[45:15] things I've done and prove me where I've
[45:17] not fulfilled the scripture when Peter
[45:21] was walking there in the in the ship and
[45:24] you know they fished all night and they
[45:25] didn't catch anything
[45:26] and here's Jesus standing on the shore
[45:28] and told him he said have you called
[45:30] anything he said no he said would just
[45:32] cast out into the deep and he said
[45:34] you'll receive and he said Lord he said
[45:37] we've fished all night
[45:38] we've not called anything brother
[45:41] branham said the one thing that Peter
[45:43] knew was had a fish he'd spent on his
[45:46] whole entire life on the sea that's all
[45:48] he had ever done his whole entire life
[45:49] was fish he's like you know we know all
[45:54] the tricks of the trade we know what
[45:55] we're doing out here but you know what
[45:57] Jesus tells him to go out and he says he
[45:59] said no nevertheless Lord he said add
[46:01] thy word I'll go out and we'll do what
[46:05] you said and as soon as they went out he
[46:07] said then they had more than they could
[46:08] they could bring in right and here's
[46:13] here's the same one that see all these
[46:15] things has taken this head that's took
[46:17] place when he cut off the high priests
[46:19] ear and the Lord touched him all the
[46:21] things that Peter had seen in his life
[46:23] and even when he before he died he told
[46:25] me he said Satan wants to shift you like
[46:28] wheat and all the things he all the
[46:29] things that he told him in his life to
[46:31] trying to explain to him about his
[46:33] ministry his life everything and then
[46:35] when all of a sudden here's Peter and
[46:38] he's trying to talk to him and trying to
[46:40] explain the weight and believe it either
[46:44] when when there were things that Peter
[46:47] got to say that nobody else got to say
[46:49] when he went up on the mountain to pray
[46:51] when he was praying in the garden he
[46:53] took Peter James and John that wasn't he
[46:55] didn't take everybody and here he is
[46:59] speaking to Peter and Peter didn't
[47:00] believe him
[47:02] Peter's one that denied him even after
[47:04] Jesus telling say listen you'll deny me
[47:06] oh I can't believe that no I wouldn't
[47:09] Lord movie right there we'd yeah and he
[47:14] kept telling listen don't look at these
[47:16] things there's a temporary setback in
[47:18] your mind what's going to take place but
[47:20] you know what it's to fulfill the
[47:21] scripture and all of a sudden here they
[47:24] run back to the team and all of a sudden
[47:25] the tomb is empty and then they come
[47:27] back and then here they are expounding
[47:30] you know he's risen well no look this is
[47:33] exactly what happened like he's saying
[47:35] and Luke Luke chapter 24 tells us and he
[47:38] and they remembered his words Andrew
[47:41] spent all that time trying to tell him
[47:43] what was going to take place then all of
[47:44] a sudden it's like oh yeah he did say
[47:46] that didn't he in the same way with us
[47:52] we we've heard the words we've heard the
[47:54] word but you know what he takes the Holy
[47:55] Ghost too quick and the word to us and
[47:57] all of a sudden it's like oh yeah he did
[47:58] say that didn't he so many times people
[48:04] people pray for they pray for a healing
[48:08] or or financial needs or deliverance or
[48:12] whatever they have need of and they're
[48:13] praying and they're praying and praying
[48:15] all of a sudden the Lord comes on the
[48:16] scene and delivers them and you know
[48:18] what they're shocked that God done it
[48:21] please they prove me he said try me he
[48:24] said knock ask seek and then if all of a
[48:30] sudden you do exactly what he said do
[48:32] then they get shot well the Lord healed
[48:34] me well you know what yeah we should
[48:37] thank God for there but you know what we
[48:39] should claim it and just walk on because
[48:40] we should which they shouldn't take us
[48:42] by surprise that he that it happens if
[48:46] the scripture has he said he said if you
[48:50] if your child asks for stone for a you
[48:54] know for bread or a fish or something he
[48:56] said would you give them to a stone or a
[48:58] snake or something he said he said if
[49:02] your child comes it has a need he said
[49:04] would you not give it to him he said if
[49:06] you being evil know how to give good
[49:08] gifts how much more your whole heavenly
[49:09] Father give unto you
[49:11] well if you have a need then while we so
[49:13] are we so shocked when God meets our
[49:15] needs why because that's the scripture
[49:19] he's doing exactly what he said he would
[49:22] do I guarantee you go back here and ask
[49:27] my boys you know if they want something
[49:28] and want some
[49:29] daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy just like
[49:38] just like it woman with the unjust judge
[49:42] drove him crazy but you know what she
[49:45] got what she wanted well you know how
[49:49] many how many of your children do the
[49:50] same thing if you know if you need
[49:53] something they're almost walk in your
[49:55] footsteps they'll almost get onto your
[49:57] feet they'll stay right there daddy
[49:59] daddy daddy daddy hey daddy you can't
[50:03] hardly turn around
[50:04] sometimes you can't hardly think without
[50:06] them being right there daddy daddy daddy
[50:08] daddy daddy daddy yeah well you know
[50:11] what I've never seen my boys in the
[50:13] whole in the whole time that they I got
[50:15] a 14 year old a nine year old you know
[50:16] I've never seen one over when I give
[50:18] them something they go WOW well how many
[50:24] of your kids when you when you ask for
[50:25] something that you give them something
[50:27] that they act they look shocked
[50:31] what's the same thing with God if you
[50:34] have a need and he said he would supply
[50:35] your needs then we don't have to look
[50:39] shocked big surprise that God meets our
[50:42] needs why because he said he would at
[50:52] times kind of get away from busy that's
[50:57] what God wants us to do God wants us to
[50:59] trust him God wants us to put our our
[51:02] every thought everything on him because
[51:05] he's the one that's going to take care
[51:06] of you if we just come on and just allow
[51:11] him to do what he has because you know
[51:14] the scripture tells us you know I has
[51:16] not seen nor ear heard neither has it
[51:18] entered in the heart of man what God has
[51:20] in store for us
[51:24] you know what if we if we trust God you
[51:26] know God will give us the very best you
[51:29] know why because he done he gave us the
[51:31] very best in the beginning the very best
[51:37] that he could do for us was give us
[51:39] eternal life and if he gave us eternal
[51:41] life then you know what that everything
[51:43] else he's because everything else like
[51:45] he said seek ye first the kingdom of God
[51:47] and all these other things will be added
[51:48] unto you
[51:49] because all you have to do is commit it
[51:51] to God and God will come on the scene
[51:53] and meet your every need and give you
[51:55] what you have need of sometimes it may
[52:01] not it may not be what we what we want
[52:03] at the time but you know many times we
[52:05] go back and look in our lives and we
[52:06] think thank God we didn't get what we
[52:08] were asking for why because God knew
[52:10] what we needed and God knew how to stay
[52:12] keep us out of situations that we
[52:15] realized that we didn't need to be in
[52:17] [Music]
[52:20] see God's God so mindful of us it you
[52:24] know sometimes it's just like trying to
[52:26] raise children many times you know they
[52:27] don't see they don't see the long run
[52:29] they don't see the big picture but you
[52:32] have to because you know what
[52:33] everybody's like well you need to be
[52:34] their friends you need to be their buddy
[52:36] well you know want sometimes you can't
[52:37] be their friend in there buddy
[52:39] sometimes you got to be the parent
[52:41] sometimes you got to be the Meany
[52:43] or as in or as in my house I'm the heavy
[52:49] we all laughing felt that's rock that's
[52:56] what well somebody's got to be the one
[52:58] to be the enforcer that's right well you
[53:02] know that's what we have the Holy Ghost
[53:04] he's that he's the one there's the word
[53:06] spoken of a Holy Ghost is given to be
[53:09] the enforcer of the word he's come on
[53:11] the scene to to make all these things
[53:13] take place and you know you know and it
[53:19] takes those because there's many people
[53:21] that have that if in the scripture that
[53:23] we see that those that have held onto
[53:24] the word but you know it takes a
[53:27] quickening of that word because it take
[53:30] it take it because you know they hold
[53:32] onto it many times what we read in the
[53:34] scripture where brother Aaron was
[53:35] talking about Mary and Joseph and you
[53:37] know they're speaking
[53:38] of Isaiah and the different scriptures
[53:40] and like well you know what one of these
[53:42] days this scripture is going to be
[53:44] fulfilled you know you know they were
[53:46] sitting there reading you know because a
[53:48] virgin shall conceive and we see how
[53:51] these things are going to take place
[53:52] while the in a speaking of the Messiah
[53:54] coming and all these things is like well
[53:56] you know we're looking for that to take
[53:57] place but you know one day that was that
[54:01] was an angel that came to spoke to Mary
[54:03] and told her you know what you're the
[54:04] one that's going to fulfill this
[54:06] scripture it's not just happening or
[54:09] something that's going to take place now
[54:10] you're the very one you're the vessel
[54:12] that's going to take it'll make this
[54:14] take place God has come to you and it
[54:17] showed favor to you that you're gonna
[54:19] fulfill this scripture and you know it's
[54:21] the same way with you and I God has
[54:23] given us favor for us to fulfill the
[54:25] scripture why because just like in the
[54:28] scripture and you know one of the things
[54:30] that I was I was looking at was you know
[54:34] many times when we when we look at these
[54:35] things and the in the scripture you know
[54:38] there's times it you know we look and we
[54:42] and lots of times what we kind of put
[54:46] women down and you know they've always
[54:49] want to talk about though we haven't but
[54:51] you know there's if you look in the
[54:52] scripture are certain things that women
[54:53] done that that man didn't do you know
[54:57] just just like Marian and Joseph you
[55:00] know Mary had to Mary had to take the
[55:02] word that Gabriel spoke to her and you
[55:05] know what Joseph didn't believe it
[55:07] here's Mary's taking this word said be
[55:10] it unto me according to thy word well
[55:12] you know what Joseph had problems with
[55:13] that here's the word coming to Mayer I
[55:17] mean to Elizabeth and speaking and you
[55:19] know what she received the word that was
[55:21] coming to her and you know what
[55:23] Zacharias had a problem with it and you
[55:26] know what they God calls their eyes to
[55:28] be a mute but Elizabeth could speak the
[55:31] word well because she received it and
[55:33] then when when Mary come and spoke to
[55:36] Elizabeth then they spoke the word and
[55:38] then she received it and a baby that had
[55:41] moved in all this in six months or
[55:42] whatever all of a sudden he jumped in
[55:44] the womb he becoming here because all of
[55:47] a sudden because at the name of Jesus
[55:49] he moved when she received this
[55:52] salutation of the word of God and
[55:54] there's many other ones in the scripture
[55:56] that you look at that it was women that
[55:58] came you know it was women it was women
[56:02] that went to the grave of Jesus and so
[56:05] that it was that it was open and it went
[56:07] to tell the rest of them and many times
[56:12] we see there's other ones in the
[56:13] scripture where it talks about women are
[56:16] the ones that actually receive the word
[56:18] and went to tell the rest of them and
[56:20] the men had a problem with it you know
[56:24] one of the things they were talking
[56:25] about in the scripture I thought was
[56:26] kind of interesting is you know there's
[56:28] no place in the scripture where a woman
[56:29] give Jesus a hard time it was always men
[56:33] and preachers you know even in the
[56:38] simplest things that Jesus told told the
[56:40] women you know what they could accept
[56:42] the word you know what why because it
[56:46] because it speaks of our day you know I
[56:50] was thinking about what brother Matthew
[56:51] was talking about everywhere in the
[56:52] scripture you see a man then you see a
[56:54] woman you see a man you see a woman well
[56:57] you know that's what takes place there
[56:58] was a man Jesus was speaking well there
[57:01] was a bride there was the women that was
[57:02] speaking of took the word that was
[57:04] speaking of our day and so it's it's our
[57:13] day the word has been spoken our day and
[57:15] you know it doesn't take somebody great
[57:17] or big it just takes a willing vessel
[57:20] God just needs a willing vessel
[57:22] he just needs somebody that's going to
[57:24] take him at his word and then you know
[57:27] because this this isn't this is the
[57:30] revival your if you if you're hearing
[57:34] the word today if it doesn't revive you
[57:36] if it doesn't stir you than you know
[57:38] what there's something wrong with and
[57:40] you know the thing is if and it's not
[57:42] just stirring you that you're hearing
[57:44] the church and inserting you but when
[57:46] it's your daily life there has to be a
[57:48] change in your daily life if it's not
[57:49] stirring you if it's not leading you if
[57:51] it's not making an overcoming a change
[57:54] in your life then you know there's
[57:55] something wrong well because it takes a
[57:59] table because this is the day this is
[58:01] the time
[58:02] of taking place of the metaphor station
[58:06] of the word God wants us to receive the
[58:10] word and he's giving it to us and now
[58:17] all we have to do is take it and go with
[58:20] it and move forward and find out what
[58:25] God wants us to do and just come and
[58:29] make a make and say Lord why what is it
[58:32] that you want me to do Lord just yield
[58:35] ourselves just like just like the Potter
[58:37] and having control of the clay just Lord
[58:40] mold us into what you'd have us to be
[58:46] and this is from the invisible union and
[58:50] there's several quotes and I'm not going
[58:52] I'm not going to get into all of them
[58:54] but from paragraph 54 brother Branham
[58:58] says now but you notice when the people
[59:00] begin to try to line with the word there
[59:03] comes a fresh message from the Word of
[59:05] God right straight to the people and
[59:07] they catch that message and line up
[59:09] every time it's just God's we have that
[59:12] and he says we have family every family
[59:15] in here is accustomed to that sometimes
[59:17] everything will run fine for you for
[59:20] years then all at once you'll hit a
[59:23] spell where we say it many times in the
[59:25] South here when it rains it pours and
[59:27] everything goes wrong you're going
[59:29] through a night then there's a day break
[59:32] then in the night time everything runs
[59:36] in continuity I take a table when I
[59:40] first read that the other night when it
[59:41] says when you're going through I thought
[59:43] it said a nightmare and it says when it
[59:46] rains it pours and everything goes wrong
[59:48] and you're going through a nightmare
[59:49] then I had to review oh it's night time
[59:50] I thought it was a nightmare because
[59:52] sometimes that's what it feels like when
[59:53] it rains it pours you feels like you're
[59:54] going through a nightmare but you know
[59:56] the thing is is you know even when you
[59:58] when you look at this and everything in
[1:00:00] your life you know what it goes in
[1:00:01] continuity you know I wanted to read
[1:00:04] that because you we have ups and downs
[1:00:06] and sometimes we feel like it feels like
[1:00:08] the downs are longer than the ups but
[1:00:09] you know what it's God leading us and
[1:00:12] still you have those ups and downs but
[1:00:13] you know God if you're lining up
[1:00:15] with the words and the words going to
[1:00:16] come to you and he's gonna give you
[1:00:18] exactly what you have need of and he's
[1:00:21] gonna lead you because I want you know
[1:00:26] because this is this is the hour in
[1:00:28] which God has come to do this you know
[1:00:32] many people are blinded by the things
[1:00:34] that you know they don't see what God's
[1:00:36] doing and they don't have spiritual eye
[1:00:38] sight to see what God is doing in this
[1:00:40] hour but you know what God wants us to
[1:00:42] see what God what he has for us and you
[1:00:45] know there's some other things I'm not
[1:00:47] going to get into not but you know you
[1:00:49] start to look and see you know even even
[1:00:52] when you see the word going forth and
[1:00:53] you know brother man talks about the
[1:00:55] former and the latter rain you know what
[1:00:59] he talks about that the former and the
[1:01:01] latter rain would come you know we see
[1:01:03] those things here here is a brother
[1:01:05] Graham said that the Holy Ghost was that
[1:01:07] was the latter rain that would come and
[1:01:09] then he said then then the former rain
[1:01:11] and the latter rain would come to prove
[1:01:13] that the lighter rain was correct
[1:01:16] and same thing because you know here is
[1:01:19] the word it's coming our day but you
[1:01:21] know we see what took place in the past
[1:01:24] and what God has done and he's been
[1:01:25] faithful all the way through and
[1:01:27] everything that he's done and you know
[1:01:29] what every age had a revival everything
[1:01:32] had to have their ups and downs and each
[1:01:34] one of them had their problems but you
[1:01:36] know what he was faithful and bringing
[1:01:38] the revival and bringing the people to
[1:01:40] their place and you know what it doesn't
[1:01:42] matter see you go through valleys and
[1:01:44] you go through hard times and you know
[1:01:46] what you think you're on the island all
[1:01:47] by yourself and you think whatever you
[1:01:49] know but you know what God is faithful
[1:01:51] he's always led everybody through and it
[1:01:53] doesn't matter what you're going through
[1:01:54] you just hold on to God because you'll
[1:01:56] go through those ups and those downs but
[1:01:58] you know what he's still going to bring
[1:02:00] the former rain and the lighter rain
[1:02:02] that he's going to quicken the word that
[1:02:04] you hold on to we must get in the word
[1:02:12] and hold on to the word you know the
[1:02:18] word is being sown would you where it's
[1:02:21] up to us to receive that word to hold on
[1:02:24] to that word and then he will quicken
[1:02:26] that word
[1:02:27] bring it to pass he will bring it to
[1:02:29] fruition hey man god bless you notice
[1:02:33] let's stay on how the musicians come but
[1:02:35] God is faithful to us whatever you have
[1:02:39] needed he's he's brought us into a
[1:02:41] revival to renew you you say lord I need
[1:02:46] another one well you know what he's he's
[1:02:48] here to do it again because you know
[1:02:51] what if he's done at one time he's gonna
[1:02:52] do it again why because you know he's
[1:02:55] gonna continue to revive this bride
[1:02:57] bring you to the place that you need to
[1:02:59] be every single time I just thank the
[1:03:07] Lord for the word because you know what
[1:03:13] it takes it takes us getting ourselves
[1:03:15] out of the way and letting him do what
[1:03:17] what he knew what he wants to do with us
[1:03:21] you know you have so many people that
[1:03:24] you know that they wish they knew what
[1:03:27] to do and you try to point them in the
[1:03:29] right direction it's Jesus Christ it's
[1:03:33] Jesus Christ you know as I was reading a
[1:03:37] sign this little story and had this
[1:03:39] great musician that came and and they
[1:03:43] were telling him oh we just love your
[1:03:45] music you're so wonderful you do you do
[1:03:47] a great job you know we just we're just
[1:03:48] so fascinated with all your music and
[1:03:50] it's like well how did you ever get to
[1:03:52] this place you must just have a gift
[1:03:54] from God that you got here and he was
[1:03:56] like you know it takes practice yeah
[1:03:58] long hours of practice no it must be you
[1:04:01] it you must be blessed above everybody
[1:04:02] else to get to these places he's like no
[1:04:04] it's practice and they're saying no and
[1:04:07] they didn't they just kept making old
[1:04:08] they were just swooning over him he's
[1:04:09] like it's practice you know I've give up
[1:04:13] a lot of things for practice and I've
[1:04:15] spent a lot of time practicing and
[1:04:17] everybody everybody thinks no it's just
[1:04:19] some gift of God and you know it just
[1:04:20] falls on top of you you know no you know
[1:04:22] what it takes practice right you know
[1:04:26] and it's just like that in the Word of
[1:04:27] God you know there you know people think
[1:04:30] that you have other people you know
[1:04:31] they're just so blessed that God put
[1:04:32] them up someplace it's like no they read
[1:04:34] their Bible and prayed and they read
[1:04:37] their Bible and prayed and they read
[1:04:39] their Bible and pray and they study the
[1:04:41] word and
[1:04:41] the read the Bible and prayed and they
[1:04:43] read their Bible and prayed and they
[1:04:44] read their Bible and frightened you know
[1:04:45] and people that people just say well
[1:04:47] it's so amazing that God come and spoke
[1:04:48] to these people and show them things
[1:04:49] it's like well you know what there's a
[1:04:52] lot of people that that you know that
[1:04:53] for meant a lot of things
[1:04:57] you know they gave up a lot of things to
[1:05:00] spend time to pray and to seek God and
[1:05:04] to listen you know because they put the
[1:05:07] time into it and then people think well
[1:05:09] you know I you know I I feel you know
[1:05:12] like well why God what does it God do
[1:05:15] this for me well you know what what have
[1:05:17] you give up what have you sacrificed you
[1:05:24] know many times because people talk
[1:05:26] about having a prayer life and and
[1:05:29] people don't realize
[1:05:30] prayer is communion and the problem is
[1:05:35] is they don't have communion you know I
[1:05:41] work I work with a guy and you know you
[1:05:43] have to get his attention sometimes to
[1:05:46] tell him something because you know what
[1:05:49] he's a motormouth I mean that's that's
[1:05:54] you know you know what pardon pardon the
[1:05:57] word but I mean that's what he is he
[1:05:58] just runs all the time just constantly
[1:06:01] talking about stuff that you know nobody
[1:06:04] cares but he's got a talk and then
[1:06:07] you've got to try to catch his attention
[1:06:07] hey hey hey Shh then you can talk to him
[1:06:12] and then he'll be doing something and
[1:06:14] he'll be doing something wrong and he'll
[1:06:16] be able to and this oh well I can't find
[1:06:17] this I can I don't know what the problem
[1:06:18] is all what the problem is and it's like
[1:06:20] hey hey hey hold on so let me tell you
[1:06:24] at the problem is you're not listening
[1:06:26] to me
[1:06:26] so I can tell you what the problem is
[1:06:28] and lots of times the Lord this is the
[1:06:31] same way Lord's going hey I'm trying to
[1:06:33] get your attention
[1:06:34] hold on like that comedian said that
[1:06:38] time God comes along and he tries to
[1:06:40] talk to us and he tries to talk to us
[1:06:41] and he can't and he hits us with a
[1:06:43] two-by-four and then we start singing he
[1:06:44] touched me oh he touched me well because
[1:06:49] he's trying to get our attention but the
[1:06:50] problem is is we don't have communion
[1:06:53] it's you know if we went in and say
[1:06:55] Lord I'm not gonna sit right here and
[1:06:57] I'm gonna wait for you to say something
[1:06:59] I don't give you time to say something
[1:07:01] yeah but you know what we just want to
[1:07:04] come talk to the Lord and tell him our
[1:07:05] problems and it's like okay we're done
[1:07:10] and we don't ever sit and say Lord you
[1:07:13] speak to me Lord what do you have that
[1:07:17] you want to tell me you know many times
[1:07:21] we just go and we sit and say lord I
[1:07:23] love you and I appreciate you and I
[1:07:26] thank you for all that you've done for
[1:07:28] me and all that you've given me but you
[1:07:31] know I want you to come speak to me and
[1:07:36] you just sit there something you know I
[1:07:38] was listening to brother Branham he said
[1:07:39] you know the best time to pray is like
[1:07:41] three or four in the morning
[1:07:43] he said when all the Devils and
[1:07:45] everything calmed down somewhere else
[1:07:47] cooled off not run not moving they said
[1:07:51] then you get up in the morning you can
[1:07:53] pray people you know I hear a lot of
[1:07:57] people talk about you know they say you
[1:08:00] know I'll wake up early in the morning
[1:08:01] sometimes three four o'clock in the
[1:08:04] morning 2:30 I'm a week and you know I
[1:08:07] can't go to sleep and you know it's
[1:08:11] always where did you talk to the Lord
[1:08:13] well no you know I tossed and turned
[1:08:18] like what did you talk to the Lord no I
[1:08:22] got up took some medicine
[1:08:23] I went got me something to drink I done
[1:08:26] this through that it's like what did you
[1:08:28] talk to the Lord no it's like well maybe
[1:08:30] the reason that the Lord's waking you up
[1:08:32] it you're waking up at 2 3 o'clock in
[1:08:34] the morning maybe that's the time the
[1:08:36] Lord realized he can talk to you yeah
[1:08:38] maybe they were trying to talk to you
[1:08:43] know I was thinking about Samuel you
[1:08:46] know he thought I was calling the whole
[1:08:48] time he kept waking up and he kept
[1:08:51] hearing the voice of God speaking
[1:08:52] tonight hey you know he kept going to a
[1:08:54] line he said here am i but you know eli
[1:08:58] was spiritual and cold on and he told
[1:09:00] him he said the next time answer Lord
[1:09:04] here am I
[1:09:06] here's your servant
[1:09:09] and you know we could do that too if the
[1:09:13] Lord wakes you up some you know you wake
[1:09:15] up in the morning sometimes and you're
[1:09:17] laying there you know just say Lord well
[1:09:19] you what would you have me to know you
[1:09:23] know I've been woken up before in the
[1:09:25] and them early in the morning sometimes
[1:09:27] and somebody come on my heart and it's
[1:09:31] time to pray for somebody and you know
[1:09:34] because there's something going on in
[1:09:36] somebody's life that God is wanting you
[1:09:38] to pray on their behalf so you know God
[1:09:43] wants to speak to us you know people
[1:09:46] people say oh I want to hear from God
[1:09:47] well you know what God wants to talk to
[1:09:49] you more than you want to hear from him
[1:09:52] and let's just let's just take a little
[1:10:00] moment of silence a little sweet hour of
[1:10:04] prayer you know I think sometimes we
[1:10:09] could all miss a little sleep to talk to
[1:10:13] the Lord have him speak to us because
[1:10:18] you know what you know we all we all
[1:10:20] need prayer we all need just and you
[1:10:24] know many times everybody wants to we
[1:10:28] want when we go to pray we want to pray
[1:10:30] for our needs it's all about us as I say
[1:10:34] it's all about me me me me me well you
[1:10:37] know what sometimes what you need to do
[1:10:38] if you want to answer from God is you
[1:10:40] don't need to be saying me me me me me
[1:10:42] sometimes you need to sit down and start
[1:10:44] praying for other people I think about
[1:10:47] brother Darrell Ward that time when he
[1:10:49] had when he messed his back up and he
[1:10:50] couldn't sleep and everything like
[1:10:52] Antony told everybody he said I can't
[1:10:54] sleep he said I'm at home I can't travel
[1:10:56] he said I can't preach but he said
[1:10:57] there's one thing I can do he said I can
[1:10:59] pray and brother Darrell said he could
[1:11:03] he was trying to sit in a chair and
[1:11:04] holding onto their handrails trying to
[1:11:06] keep his back from moving you know he'd
[1:11:08] lay in the floor he couldn't get
[1:11:10] comfortable he couldn't do nothing he
[1:11:11] was miserable but you told people just
[1:11:13] started sending his prayer their prayer
[1:11:15] requests to brother Darrell he said he
[1:11:16] was praying all the time and he said it
[1:11:20] cause there's only thing I could do he
[1:11:21] said I could I couldn't
[1:11:22] he said I couldn't do nothing but he
[1:11:24] said I can pray and you know what he
[1:11:26] didn't get to the point where he's
[1:11:27] praying for his self he said he was
[1:11:29] praying for everybody else and he said
[1:11:31] he was early one morning he said he was
[1:11:33] sitting in iron he was praying he said
[1:11:36] the Holy Spirit come in the room right
[1:11:37] and touched him and that's what we need
[1:11:42] to think of sometimes we need to be
[1:11:44] mindful of other people and God can come
[1:11:47] on the scene and meet our needs Amen god
