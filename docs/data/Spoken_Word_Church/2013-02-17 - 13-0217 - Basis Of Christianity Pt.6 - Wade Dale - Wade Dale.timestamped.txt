[0:00] all right
[0:03] next Sunday you can
[0:08] um we're gonna start on
[0:09] faith on the Statue of a perfect man
[0:11] we're going to kind of finish up today
[0:14] with what God Said here in Proverbs
[0:16] chapter 8.
[0:18] start with faith the foundation
[0:23] what
[0:25] thank you
[0:29] let's start with
[0:33] hello
[0:34] what verse 7.
[0:37] chapter 8 verse 7.
[0:42] and I want you to look at how many times
[0:46] that that God says I my because I've got
[0:50] them all circled in my Bible and it's
[0:51] just all the way down through there so
[0:53] you see that it's what God is doing
[0:56] but watch how the me and the me
[1:00] and the eye and eye becomes God and you
[1:02] together as one all right but watch for
[1:06] my mouth shall speak truth and
[1:08] wickedness is an Abomination to my lips
[1:11] all the words of my mouth are in
[1:13] righteousness there is nothing forward
[1:14] or perverse in them
[1:17] they are all plain to him that
[1:19] understandeth
[1:21] okay there's no mystery to this thing
[1:23] the mystery is history
[1:25] if somebody comes to bring you a mystery
[1:27] you better get away from them because
[1:29] the mystery's already finished brother
[1:30] Rams are the mystery is now history so
[1:32] we're looking at the open book they are
[1:35] all plain to him that understandeth
[1:38] and write to them that findeth not or
[1:41] they find knowledge
[1:42] receive my instructions and not Silent
[1:45] not silver and knowledge rather than
[1:48] Choice gold
[1:49] for wisdom is better than rubies and all
[1:52] the things that may be desired are not
[1:54] to be compared to it
[1:57] what wisdom
[1:59] I wisdom so it must be a person
[2:02] eye wisdom dwell with prudence and find
[2:06] out knowledge
[2:07] of witty inventions
[2:09] in other words just what we were talking
[2:11] about the devil's devices
[2:13] all right the fear of the Lord
[2:16] is to hate evil
[2:19] pride and arrogance in the evil way in
[2:22] the forward mouth
[2:23] do I hate
[2:25] counsel is mine and sound wisdom I am
[2:30] understanding see there's I I have
[2:32] understanding I have strength so if
[2:35] you're born again today that's what
[2:36] we're going to talk about next Sunday
[2:37] being born again because that starts at
[2:39] Faith
[2:40] when the eye
[2:42] I am see what it says I am
[2:46] understanding so who is that
[2:49] that's Jehovah God
[2:51] but when he comes down we know that that
[2:53] Jehovah's the old is Jesus of the new so
[2:55] that's what he is but if you're a part
[2:58] of that
[2:59] then you become wisdom you become
[3:01] knowledge and you have strength so I am
[3:03] understanding I have strength
[3:07] by me who wisdom or God or you can say
[3:10] by me if you're born again you see how
[3:13] close this is going to be by me King's
[3:15] Reign and Princess decree Justice
[3:18] by me Prince's Rule and Noble even all
[3:21] the judges of the Earth
[3:23] I love them that love me
[3:25] and those that I seek that those that
[3:27] seek me early
[3:29] shall find me
[3:30] praise the Lord Eula yeah praise the
[3:33] Lord
[3:34] said praise the Lord
[3:37] that's because your parents are dead
[3:39] well yeah praying for death free praise
[3:41] the Lord that's right
[3:43] that's good
[3:45] ain't that right
[3:48] you see that you'll see yeah I can get a
[3:52] lot more toys now
[3:53] because my parents don't have to pay for
[3:56] Dad
[3:58] I love them that love me and those that
[4:00] seek me early shall find me rich is an
[4:03] honor are with me yay durable riches and
[4:06] righteousness my fruit is better than
[4:09] gold
[4:11] yay then fine gold and my revenue is in
[4:15] Choice silver
[4:16] I
[4:17] lead in the way of righteousness in the
[4:19] midst of the passive judgment
[4:21] then I may cause those that love me to
[4:24] inherit substance what does the Bible
[4:27] say faith is the substance of things
[4:31] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[4:33] Seen so what's he talking about faith
[4:36] that I may cause those that love me to
[4:39] inherit substance all right and I will
[4:43] fill their treasure
[4:45] promise I will fill their treasure all
[4:48] right so we get to New Birth and we're
[4:50] going to start at Faith next Sunday
[4:51] we're going to fill ourselves up there
[4:54] or God's Gonna Fill us up through the
[4:55] statue and perfect man starting next
[4:56] Sunday
[4:59] then verse 21 that I may cause those
[5:02] that love me
[5:04] to inherit substance
[5:07] that I will and I will fill their
[5:10] Treasures
[5:11] the Lord possessed me
[5:14] in the beginning of his way
[5:17] not our way
[5:19] predestination before the foundation of
[5:21] the world now look what's happening here
[5:22] in Proverbs he's going all the way
[5:24] before the foundation of the world
[5:26] and that's what I wrote my book that's
[5:28] promised to me the Lord possessed me in
[5:31] the beginning of his way now we know
[5:32] he's talking about wisdom but if we're
[5:34] connected with the wisdom
[5:37] we got new birth we got new birth right
[5:39] I am is in us then this is talking about
[5:41] you and I
[5:43] all right
[5:45] I was set up wait a minute the Lord
[5:48] possessed me in the beginning of his way
[5:50] before his works of old in other words
[5:52] before the six days of creation
[5:56] he knew who we were before the
[5:58] foundation of the world right
[6:01] I was set up from Everlasting
[6:04] from the beginning or ever the Earth was
[6:10] when there were no depth
[6:14] I was brought forth
[6:18] when there was no fountain abounding
[6:20] with water
[6:22] before the mountains were settled before
[6:25] the hills was
[6:27] before the hills was I brought forth
[6:31] well as yet he had not made the Earth
[6:34] nor the field nor the highest part of
[6:36] the Dust of the world when he prepared
[6:39] the heavens
[6:40] I was there
[6:42] amen amen when he said accomplice upon
[6:46] the face of the death
[6:48] when he established the clouds above
[6:50] when he strengthened The Fountains of
[6:52] the deep when he gave to the Sea his
[6:55] decree that the water should not pass
[6:57] his commandment when he appointed the
[6:59] foundations of the world
[7:01] there I was by him
[7:03] and that's not by him
[7:06] standing by him we are by him
[7:10] by him all things are made so he comes
[7:14] forth by him come forth that by has come
[7:16] forth not standing beside that's good
[7:18] remember we don't want God standing
[7:19] beside woman God in us all right we
[7:22] don't want to we don't want an anointing
[7:24] or a perusian or something like that we
[7:26] won't God ends God's got to be in you to
[7:27] wrap you out of here he can be an
[7:30] anointed one God can stand right by the
[7:32] side of an anointing one him dying go to
[7:33] hell because he's not in right okay he's
[7:37] got to be in you
[7:39] then I was by him as one brought up with
[7:43] him
[7:45] that's why I see when you get the new
[7:46] birth that's why it's so important the
[7:48] Statue of first man is so important
[7:49] because that's the mind of God
[7:51] if you're not born again you can't
[7:52] understand the mind of God you can't
[7:54] understand just the simple things right
[7:57] that's just a common I mean that's just
[7:59] a common knowledge but once you do you
[8:01] come under the you come under all these
[8:03] promises that when I was then I was by
[8:06] him as one brought up with him and I
[8:09] wish daily his Delight
[8:12] this was the creator we're talking about
[8:13] here all right
[8:15] rejoicing always before him
[8:18] Where Were You Joe when uh
[8:22] sons of God's got it for Joel
[8:25] or you Joe when God laid the foundation
[8:27] of the world
[8:28] okay
[8:31] and I was daily his Delight rejoicing
[8:33] always before him rejoicing
[8:36] in the habitable habitable part
[8:39] of his Earth
[8:42] not this Earth
[8:43] his Earth all right
[8:46] where were we what's God's word Jesus
[8:49] Christ
[8:50] God's Earth is Jesus Christ right right
[8:53] right
[8:54] the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand what
[8:56] was the kingdom the kingdom was in him
[8:57] so where were we we were in him we were
[9:01] in his Earth okay
[9:04] we got to remember that this thing got
[9:06] disconnected but we got to find out that
[9:08] it what was disconnected has got to be
[9:09] reconnected
[9:10] like brother Bob did some wonderful job
[9:13] last night man I remember just perfect
[9:16] for what we needed at the time and God
[9:19] wants us back to fellowship like Adam
[9:21] and Eve Adam and Eve in the cool of the
[9:22] garden
[9:23] walking in front of God communing with
[9:26] God
[9:27] with no shame and that's what we're
[9:30] going to do over there with no shame
[9:31] we're going to commune with god well we
[9:33] got to get back to that here we can't
[9:34] wait till we get into heaven everybody's
[9:36] wanting to wait to get to heaven to do
[9:38] things why can't we do that here right
[9:39] because if we're restored back here was
[9:42] The Fellowship here's where we fell well
[9:44] when we go back to here
[9:46] it's like Bob said last night that's
[9:48] where we connect back with God
[9:51] and we get to bring our spouse with us
[9:53] who is us
[9:55] and not just live through this life with
[9:57] a spouse
[9:59] we live through eternity with a spouse
[10:02] the same one brother Brown hadn't
[10:04] meeting brother Brown had hope
[10:08] and they'll live together not as we live
[10:10] down here but like we were like I was
[10:12] saying last night
[10:14] not to have to what brother Bob was
[10:16] saying but it it does it helps us to see
[10:19] that if we love our wife our husband
[10:21] down here
[10:22] and we think man we're Inseparable we
[10:24] are one which is true but brother Brown
[10:27] said take that filial of right times a
[10:30] million times a million times a million
[10:33] and he said that's what agape love is
[10:35] over there so you think well man we're
[10:37] not going to be able to be husband and
[10:38] wife like we are and that would be
[10:39] better right we'll be more all the
[10:41] jealousy will be gone all the tones of
[10:43] life will be gone all them you know
[10:45] having to get up and go to work and and
[10:47] balance the checkbook and balance our
[10:49] finances and all those things you know
[10:51] you're going to be right there
[10:53] and you're gonna be able to live Eternal
[10:55] with
[10:57] she's not going to get old and you're
[10:58] not going to get old so praise the Lord
[10:59] for that
[11:01] so
[11:03] but like
[11:05] Boyd was saying last night we're so much
[11:07] one to where when you see brother Dale
[11:09] you don't have to see Mama but you do
[11:12] see Mom right because brother and sister
[11:14] that was so much one you see if you see
[11:16] one of them you know that they're
[11:17] totally connected and I wish that worked
[11:20] for everybody
[11:21] but uh we're getting there rejoicing in
[11:24] the habitable part of his Earth
[11:27] and my Delights were with
[11:29] the sons of men all right now therefore
[11:33] hearken unto me owe you children for
[11:35] blessed are they that keep my ways
[11:39] hear instruction and be wise and refuse
[11:42] it not
[11:43] there's the key
[11:45] he's laid out here
[11:47] but we still have to choose whether we
[11:50] want to keep it or refute it all right
[11:52] blessed is a man
[11:55] that heareth me
[11:58] watching daily at my Gates
[12:01] waiting at the post of my door
[12:05] listen to this
[12:08] for who shall findeth me
[12:10] find his life
[12:12] and shall obtain favor
[12:14] of the Lord
[12:16] but he that sinneth against me wrongeth
[12:19] his own soul
[12:21] all they that hate me
[12:24] love death
[12:25] all that to hate me love death all right
[12:28] so there we come to a place to where
[12:31] we gonna we're gonna to uh
[12:34] see if anybody has any questions but
[12:36] we're going to start next Sunday with
[12:39] faith the foundation and statue of
[12:41] perfect man to read the book I'm going
[12:44] to read a quote here from statue of
[12:45] perfect man 1962 1014. just kind of scan
[12:49] through but you don't have to go all the
[12:51] way through it just go we're running
[12:52] around covers faith and then stop
[12:53] because we're going to cover virtue
[12:55] after that but we're going to cover
[12:57] Faith face real wide
[12:59] real big long foundation so we need to
[13:01] cover Faith a lot longer then we need to
[13:03] cover the other ones all right okay
[13:05] because you got to have a good
[13:06] foundation all right like brother Tom
[13:08] was talking about Wednesday night did
[13:09] such a wonderful job you gotta have that
[13:11] Foundation built on a rock you can't
[13:13] have it built on sand
[13:15] first this is paragraph 131 first you
[13:19] must be born again right and then when
[13:22] you're born again you have faith
[13:25] because really it's just a hope all
[13:28] right faith is Faith is the substance of
[13:31] things we'll get into it next Sunday but
[13:33] listen to what he's saying watch first
[13:35] you must be born again and then when
[13:37] you're born again you have faith
[13:41] he's talking about substance Faith right
[13:45] he's not just talking about believing
[13:46] your car is going to start tomorrow
[13:47] believing that this is going to happen
[13:49] or believe no he's talking about
[13:50] substant faith he's talking about the
[13:51] faith of God when we come to a place to
[13:53] where we say God this is it I'm done
[13:57] with everything else this is it this is
[13:58] the faith I have it says when you're
[14:01] born again you have faith you believe
[14:03] the word until you're born again you'll
[14:06] argue against it you so I don't argue
[14:08] against the word if you don't do it out
[14:10] there
[14:12] you're arguing against it
[14:15] nobody understand you know I'm not going
[14:17] to argue against the word I don't ever I
[14:18] don't get up arguing no but if you don't
[14:20] live what the word says you're arguing
[14:22] against the word of God
[14:24] just the way it is sorry
[14:26] if you're just religiously inclined and
[14:29] you've got a a little human knowledge
[14:31] that you should do right
[14:33] you'll never be able to agree upon the
[14:36] word of God you'll never do it now this
[14:38] is the prophet
[14:39] he's talking yesterday somebody was
[14:44] um
[14:45] talking about something about
[14:47] denominational churches
[14:50] the girls wear shorts men wear shorts
[14:52] they take their coffee in they take
[14:54] their water in they take and they just
[14:55] and they just have a it's just a lodge
[14:58] meeting
[14:59] well somebody said well why is that I
[15:01] said guys you don't believe what the
[15:03] prophet said now
[15:06] if a prophet We Believe brother Brown's
[15:08] a prophet if a prophet declared
[15:10] something in the Bible if Elijah
[15:12] declared it wasn't going to rain for
[15:13] three and a half years it didn't rain
[15:15] because the prophet said it right
[15:18] brother Brown said they're lodges
[15:20] there'll never be nothing but a lodge so
[15:23] listen folks it's like me oh Clark and I
[15:25] were talking about last night he said
[15:28] the Bible says don't touch that unclean
[15:30] thing
[15:32] don't ever go out there thinking you're
[15:34] going to save them people as a church
[15:36] whole
[15:37] no way
[15:39] they're dead
[15:40] they're done and buried
[15:43] sorry but that's what the prophet said
[15:46] so there gonna never be no more than a
[15:48] lodge now people are going to come out
[15:49] of that
[15:51] people are gonna come out of that
[15:52] looking for something
[15:54] right but the ones that stay in there
[15:56] that's just the lodge that's just where
[15:59] they go and have a cup of coffee kind of
[16:00] like we did last night we had a
[16:02] Valentine's dinner you know we ate and
[16:04] we you know we drank some sweet tea and
[16:07] and we just had a meeting
[16:10] we talked about God a little while
[16:13] then we had fun we play party games you
[16:17] know I mean well that's exactly one a
[16:19] denomination is it's just a watch if
[16:21] brother Brown said it was just a lodge
[16:23] then it's just a lodge it never will be
[16:25] nothing else but Lodge so let's just try
[16:27] to I I love people in the out in those
[16:30] churches but as long as they stay in
[16:33] that system I'm not gonna have nothing
[16:34] to do with them don't ever go out there
[16:36] and say you're going to go out there and
[16:38] convert to people you don't convert to
[16:39] people you bring them here this is where
[16:42] the word is it ain't out there it's here
[16:43] that's dead
[16:47] John admired that
[16:49] in Revelations John turn and admired it
[16:52] and the word admired means love
[16:55] and the angel immediately showed him
[16:57] that there was a cup full of blood
[17:00] overflowing and that's where all that
[17:02] came from was that treaty
[17:05] church that he showed John in Revelation
[17:07] remember John typed us
[17:09] John Topps us right right so the bride
[17:12] was leaning and looking at that
[17:14] denominational horror sorry and was
[17:19] admiring it and immediately the angel
[17:21] said no said all the blood of the Martyr
[17:25] Saints is in the cup she's holding in
[17:27] her hand so that made John turn away
[17:29] from him same thing with us we could get
[17:30] away from this stuff well we can think
[17:32] well they're okay no they're not okay
[17:34] they're dead
[17:35] unless you're alive in Christ and you
[17:37] got the new birth you're dead I don't
[17:39] care if you're sitting here today
[17:40] that's what really attracts the foolish
[17:42] virgin to me because when they're asked
[17:45] you know what they believe they'll say
[17:47] it's better to serve God within the
[17:50] framework of the church and that's going
[17:52] to happen here
[17:53] that's going to happen in I don't say
[17:55] this church but that's going to happen
[17:56] in the in the ranks of the message and
[17:58] it's happening already
[18:00] that they're compromising with the word
[18:02] of God saying the Cloud's not right and
[18:03] this is not right and brother random's
[18:05] not right they'll become compromisers
[18:07] don't ever be a compromise
[18:10] because look but my point is watch what
[18:12] brother Brown said
[18:15] until you're born again you're arguing
[18:17] against it okay so if you're not born
[18:19] again you're always going to argue
[18:20] somebody's gonna that's why that bastard
[18:23] children can't take correction you try
[18:25] to correct somebody and they go oh I
[18:26] bless God well
[18:29] says right here until you're born again
[18:31] you'll argue against it
[18:33] if you're just religiously inclined and
[18:35] you've got a little human knowledge that
[18:36] you should do right you'll never be able
[18:39] to agree upon the word of God you'll
[18:41] never do it
[18:43] so there's the line there's the prophet
[18:45] there's a line you'll always be a
[18:47] compromiser you'll always live a
[18:49] different life out there and then come
[18:50] in here and live a different one here so
[18:52] don't don't don't mess with me on that
[18:54] one because brother Brown was very he
[18:56] was very straight on the line
[18:59] they're dead right we're alive
[19:02] don't mix them
[19:04] death and life don't mix together all
[19:06] right
[19:07] you've got to be born again and born
[19:10] again it produces faith
[19:14] all right then after you've got faith
[19:17] this right here f-a-i-t-h he's pointing
[19:19] at the chart
[19:20] then you're just in position of growth
[19:23] you just in position of growing that's
[19:25] when you really start he said when I'm
[19:27] born again a gorgeous dealing with me
[19:30] and all these things
[19:32] he's dealing with you as a baby you're
[19:34] drinking milk
[19:36] you're stumbling and falling sometimes
[19:38] because you're a little baby you're
[19:39] you're a spirit baby in Christ
[19:41] but he wants us to go and grow up
[19:44] to where Peter says Silver and Gold Have
[19:46] I None
[19:48] Peter didn't have anything
[19:50] uh physically
[19:52] because he says silver and gold in other
[19:54] words what he was saying to the person
[19:57] the guy at the gate beautiful
[19:59] he was impotent in his or in his legs
[20:03] and he said look man I can't take you to
[20:06] a hospital
[20:07] I don't have enough money to take you to
[20:09] a clinic to get you better
[20:14] we were staying up you know Benny and
[20:17] them last night till about one o'clock
[20:18] talking about this but it's loud as hell
[20:21] we get sick we're going to the doctor
[20:22] that's okay
[20:24] but what about when we can't get to the
[20:26] doctor right that's what Peter was
[20:27] saying Peter said silver and gold in
[20:29] other words I can't make you a doctor's
[20:30] appointment for us to go figure how this
[20:32] thing works he said Silver and Gold Have
[20:35] I None but such as I have right he had
[20:37] some substance
[20:39] and it came out that was The Virtue
[20:41] because remember they walked in that
[20:43] right up there where brotherly kind of
[20:45] says that Peter Paul and all them they
[20:47] were at the faith of the fathers that's
[20:49] what's been eat down through the
[20:51] denominational years now it's being
[20:53] brought back up because we got to take
[20:55] that to take a Rapture but they had it
[20:58] he said Silver and Gold Have I learned
[20:59] but such as I have
[21:01] I give underlying
[21:03] yeah I've been standing on faith and you
[21:05] can probably talk for the next year or
[21:07] just on faith oh yeah I'm sure Jesus
[21:09] even rebukes the disciples but not
[21:11] having enough Faith that's right so how
[21:13] much more
[21:14] oh absolutely well see he reviewed the
[21:17] disciples and he knew they weren't born
[21:18] again he just knew he had given
[21:20] something to use and they were using it
[21:24] because they didn't have substance Faith
[21:26] until the day of Pentecost the day of
[21:28] Pentecost they had substance faith
[21:32] the one before Jesus was imparting Faith
[21:35] he was giving him he said go out he'll
[21:38] sit cast out Devils do things like that
[21:40] but what greater though he said when the
[21:42] uh we'll read it when the shepherd's
[21:45] still here
[21:46] you can lean toward me but what are you
[21:48] gonna do when I'm gone when I'm gone
[21:49] though I'm gonna make a promise I'm
[21:50] going to come back and be greater
[21:52] right like we were talking about last
[21:54] night about the third pool brother Brown
[21:55] said what you see in part when a man if
[21:58] what his was part
[21:59] if that from from 47 to 65 if that was
[22:04] part
[22:06] he said what you've seen in part
[22:09] you'll see in this fullness when the
[22:11] squeeze comes and why because it was in
[22:13] one man then right
[22:15] now it's in a mini-membered body listen
[22:18] the worst thing they can do like Tom was
[22:20] talking about Alaska the worst thing
[22:22] they can do is put us together
[22:24] exactly that's the worst thing they can
[22:28] do is put us together
[22:29] Upper Room everybody understand 12 and
[22:33] the Feet Work Church in emphasis had 12
[22:35] people and brother Brown said it was a
[22:37] powerful Church
[22:39] so the worst thing they can do is put us
[22:41] together
[22:48] get them together so hey if I take us to
[22:51] Alaska some of y'all that get cold
[22:53] that's your problem
[22:55] sorry sister Anna you just have to get
[22:56] you a mutt luck or something or some fur
[22:58] and all that stuff you know that's okay
[23:00] but you know what though but watch the
[23:03] third pull then he said when the squeeze
[23:05] comes watch it then he's in other words
[23:06] so that's what I'm saying if we do have
[23:09] to go to Alaska and if they do tow us
[23:10] out to the elements if you break your
[23:12] leg we're supposed to be to the point
[23:14] and say Silver and Gold Have I None
[23:16] I can't take you to a doctor because
[23:19] they won't we we've been marked right
[23:21] see they're gonna Mark us
[23:24] thinking that we're the ones with the
[23:25] mark of the base it's kind of like Ahab
[23:27] going to Elijah
[23:29] and he says Elijah you are causing us so
[23:32] much trouble that's what the
[23:34] government's going to say to us you
[23:36] called and Elijah's going to go I'm no
[23:38] I'm not the trouble you're the trouble
[23:40] right okay and then go ahead Elijah and
[23:44] remember he took Elisha and put him
[23:47] right in the middle of the enemy's camp
[23:48] and opened the enemy's eyes and they
[23:50] overtook them that's what's going to
[23:52] happen to you and I we're going to be to
[23:53] a place where we say silver and gonna
[23:55] have our none but
[23:57] um brother Bob breaks the leg or he's
[23:59] got something serious went on
[24:01] lay hands on the sick say I'll recover
[24:03] that bone will come right back where you
[24:04] go sleep that's the third pull in his
[24:06] power but we don't need it now
[24:10] how many of y'all rolled in a in a cold
[24:13] car come to church this morning
[24:16] had to take a cold shower last week
[24:20] because you couldn't get no water
[24:23] how many of you when you have a
[24:25] toothache
[24:26] you go put a little Orajel on her to go
[24:28] to the doctor
[24:31] that's what I thought you think this is
[24:33] going to work this ain't gonna work
[24:35] like brother Dale said persecution why
[24:37] we should have it you know why because
[24:39] we're all out of sand
[24:41] we don't have to go scrounge for our
[24:42] food no we go to
[24:45] Ingles Kroger hey we got a choice
[24:47] so what is this
[24:49] so it's like a brother Tom and I were
[24:51] talking this is where we get the word
[24:53] packed in US
[24:55] and Brenda asked last night she said
[24:56] well what are we going to do if we can't
[24:58] come to church if we're scattered I said
[25:00] brother Dale's always said he's trying
[25:01] to pack you for so much of the word
[25:03] that's right but where if you can't get
[25:05] with somebody or you can only get with
[25:07] two or three he said we're two or three
[25:08] who gathered in my name you can get two
[25:10] or three people together God's just as
[25:12] pleased there as he is in this church
[25:13] once they close this church down so
[25:15] don't worry don't have fear this is the
[25:17] greatest time coming there's going to be
[25:19] a people that's going to make it through
[25:21] and he give it to us not the other ages
[25:24] he's give us the equipment to make it
[25:27] through right you know Alaska's Alaska
[25:29] is a scary place they told us when we
[25:32] were up there they prepare for winter
[25:33] three months in advance and one guy said
[25:35] if you don't prepare for winter you're
[25:37] probably gonna die
[25:40] because the Wilderness up there it's bad
[25:42] it's harsh 40 below zero you could die
[25:45] of you can die on hypothermia 40 degrees
[25:48] if you get wet
[25:50] imagine minus 40.
[25:52] when nothing will work
[25:55] you can't fire a gun at minus 40 degrees
[25:57] because you bolt stuck
[26:00] so what are you gonna do
[26:02] we're gonna have trust in God
[26:04] there was light and Goshen where
[26:06] everything else was black that whole
[26:08] land just like the United States had a
[26:10] total blackout and there's one little
[26:11] place in Louisville Georgia a little Dot
[26:14] and we got light and everything you know
[26:16] let's go outside and go Amanda we got
[26:17] sunshine and then you know two miles
[26:19] down the road you can't see in front of
[26:21] you your hand in front of your face
[26:24] well that's what God's going to do if he
[26:26] delivered the people of Israel and if he
[26:28] delivered everybody down Through the
[26:29] Ages just like that he's got to do the
[26:31] same thing for us I was just going to
[26:34] say my son told me it's been a couple
[26:36] years ago that those in camps in Alaska
[26:41] um
[26:43] they're fully staffed what they even
[26:46] have staff waiting
[26:49] well guys if brother Branham said that
[26:51] in 1963
[26:53] that they had camps already in Alaska
[26:55] they probably already blow bulldozed
[26:58] them over
[26:59] because that's been 40 something years
[27:01] 50 years
[27:03] them things are old by now the ones
[27:06] brother Brown was talking about they
[27:07] built some new ones now I'm sure
[27:11] so
[27:12] some people are going to be herded up
[27:14] like the Jews if we're a type of the
[27:15] Jews and the Jew was persecuted just
[27:17] like that they were taking the
[27:18] Concentration Camp some didn't make it
[27:21] some did
[27:22] but what about a place
[27:24] because the Jews didn't have the Holy
[27:26] Ghost right so they were put into these
[27:29] places and they folded their they folded
[27:31] their clothes and they thought they were
[27:33] going to live in this big dormitory and
[27:34] all of a sudden the door shut the window
[27:36] shut and the gas comes on
[27:38] and they killed him
[27:39] but what a but what a meeting to be
[27:42] there and have 500 people in a building
[27:46] 500 Believers in the building because
[27:47] you're going to know when a believer in
[27:49] unbelief that's why brother Branson
[27:50] analyzen Sapphire may not be always in a
[27:52] church
[27:54] it could be out in a meeting somewhere
[27:55] it could be out when we go you're gonna
[27:57] you're gonna find out if you got the
[27:58] goods or not but what about when they
[27:59] turn the gas on and open it up an hour
[28:01] later and we're still in there rejoicing
[28:03] and praising God
[28:05] because the gas ain't gonna bother us if
[28:07] we're predestinated to make the Rapture
[28:09] that's right without a body I mean with
[28:10] a body change and not death I don't care
[28:12] who they put I don't care what they turn
[28:14] on cyanide they didn't do anything you
[28:15] want to
[28:16] anything they want to they cannot harm
[28:19] you unless God's ready for you to go
[28:21] it's like sister Brenda out in Oklahoma
[28:23] I met her two weeks ago she was like
[28:25] another long time
[28:27] she was so smiling and just so
[28:30] she was so happy
[28:32] she's dead
[28:34] the doctors don't know broclosure the
[28:36] doctor said they do not know what killed
[28:38] her
[28:39] he said they would try this and she'd
[28:41] get worse try this she'd get worse and
[28:43] what they tried to reverse it and make
[28:45] it better than anybody else it made her
[28:46] worse so they just quit and she just
[28:48] died
[28:50] God saw her come to a point
[28:52] and that's all she could do she was
[28:54] finished with her race she was done
[28:57] so now she's asleep
[28:59] She's Not Dead
[29:01] she's sleeping
[29:02] okay she's she's not dead
[29:05] you saw the Bible says the dead in
[29:07] Christ Your Eyes First You're Dead In
[29:09] Christ now all right
[29:11] I've always and I told you another day
[29:13] that just that would just come to me
[29:14] brother Bob and you just sometimes
[29:16] you'll be thinking on something like
[29:18] that and I'm like God well now that
[29:19] scripture just sounds a little bit
[29:22] around alive and remain will not prevent
[29:25] or hinder those which are asleep
[29:28] for the dead and Crash Your Eyes First
[29:31] well there's no death to a Christian
[29:34] their sleep but if you're dead in Christ
[29:36] you're dead now so what he's saying is
[29:38] the dead that are in Christ now
[29:41] that go to sleep
[29:43] will come up
[29:45] and we which are alive and remain that
[29:47] are dead in Christ now we're not going
[29:48] to hinder those in our sleep because
[29:50] that's all they're doing is sleeping
[29:51] praise God sister Brenda was she had a
[29:53] lot of depression and stuff from coming
[29:54] out in Oklahoma
[29:56] she had a lot of depression issues she
[29:57] had migraine headaches so bad she just
[29:59] get sick and just pass out
[30:01] she'll never have to worry about that no
[30:02] more right
[30:05] Eternal as Eternal can be she's right
[30:08] there at that point so so they had a
[30:10] nice home going for her yesterday and
[30:12] her dad was not very sad uh Clark said
[30:16] maybe you'll hit him later but just keep
[30:17] keep a family in prayers it was really
[30:19] sudden she was only like 40. 45
[30:22] something like that
[30:23] and she battled depression for a long
[30:25] time but uh God took her home
[30:28] she started coming back to church about
[30:30] five or six years ago
[30:31] really really started living the life
[30:34] and give her heart to God and
[30:37] she's not a lot better place than we are
[30:39] if you ain't gotta go through nothing no
[30:41] more she's dying she's Spanish she's
[30:43] asleep she's waiting on us she's one of
[30:46] those they now they without us cannot be
[30:48] made perfect all right let's go
[30:50] Faith that's what we're gonna start on
[30:52] next
[30:53] thank you
