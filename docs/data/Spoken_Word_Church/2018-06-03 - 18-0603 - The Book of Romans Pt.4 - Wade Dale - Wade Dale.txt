TRANSCRIPT
========================================
fear and we have this outfit fixed we will head into the book of Romans again hope yet so far enjoying it roaming the second chapter of it it's good and then I'm gonna read in fact I got a long while let's read like the four first four verses you read them up here I'm gonna read the guideline okay you have to taking that look remember in Chapter 1 when we enter chapter 1 remember remember that man foot chapters in Paul just wrote a letter so he's continuing his thought of the before which was last Sunday we were talking about without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful know what the judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them to do them I think our pleasure ended up now he's beginning this talk therefore thou art inexcusable o man okay so this is we start okay therefore thou art inexcusable o man thou who judges up for in 1000 other they'll condemn estai self since now the judge does practice the same thing verse 2 then but we know that the sentence of God is according to truth unto those who practice such things and dust they'll think this oh man thou who judges those practicing such things and yet are doing this thing that thou shalt escape the sentence of God question mark barred us now despise the abundance of His goodness in for and patience being ignorant that this goodness of God entices thee to a Reformation select first for let's read it again as well ain't it our dust out despise the abundance of His goodness and forbearance and patience and being ignorant that this goodness of guarding tosses thee to a revelation alright so now let's go back and read therefore thou art it's inexcusable o man delivers whosoever thou art the judges for more in dumb judgest another thou condemn us thy self or thou that judgest doest the same thing now what's Paul talking about he sees a natural group of people doing these inexcusable things fornicators all that list before well what's he saying like I told you last Sunday we look at a two-fold thing because these people here are doing experiments he speaks in the government they have the same devil they don't have to touch they don't have to commit adultery or they don't have to be homosexual or anything like that but that demon what that demon does that demon causes you to do certain things burning your own lesson all those things that we'll do this before but what about talking about because remember I think if I go commit adultery against you not getting standing the book or some people did I can't stand in the pulpit and preach against adultery but now if I have a denominational spirit on me I've never touched a woman in my life that's why I said we don't realize folks this thing right here does not stand this flex light does not sin Jesus told them he said all you gotta do is look on a woman now nobody bad that's here that's not here cuz I'm sure the preachers not going never touch the wall Jesus did yeah but that same adulterer spirit that your that you won't accept me in other words he said you won't accept me because of your denominational ideas or your mmm Trinitarian concept or whatever you want to in it your false doctrine cuz remember false doctrine contrary to God is just like that whole list of people adulterers liars and all those things living right I mean you hit it it's just spirit because like I don't think I'm puttin this this week sermon even in the third seal and come at the black course it was the blackness of Cain we will talk about this afternoon it was the blackness of Cain that's what killed him right it was his doctrine it wasn't that he killed Abel it was his doctrine what the only God jay-z movies doctrine the problem with the game was he had no repentance just like watch this look the goodness of God led to speak to repent Cain never repented never repented okay but he would have repented I got the devil in it the ones first thing he done the worst thing Kane could have done was the last thing he did he went out from the presence of God so he showed his true colors we'll talk about that this afternoon but who long time the third single back to Genesis chapter 4 right so what's Paul saying he he's not judging me and listen we don't judge people you're not supposed to judging by remember the Bible says you guys whatever you do that'll be me to back to you we are judgmental people but we should not judge we should let God judge because what in verse 4 watch verse 4 in the emphatic die Glocke what our dust our despised the abundance of His goodness and forbearance and patience see God was patient with us dug for being with us amen and the problem with us is it is God for bearing with us but but we don't want to be forbearing with my head yeah we want that person to see it my way or the highway okay the consolation forbearance and patience being ignorant that this goodness of God incasa's the reclamation we always see my honey that's my but we are sure that the judgment of God see even if even it's mastered we don't like brother l said he don't he don't speak to your flesh that's the problem that's the problem that like I was covering last Sunday that's the problem the message when they first got started the message of the hour beat the flesh didn't do anything for the stove be the flesh beat you into submission instead to say it fifty years later it's still doing some of that and some people they think is their address yeah but if we would have ever got that group boarding in called them that's my brother Branson new versus the hilltop subject and people don't usually teach a lot just plain messy brother you got the sea then you come alive with you born again and you did you come Church don't you well know it half the time anymore so he can't say that okay so what if we count it therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judges for wherein thou judgest another thou condemned as myself well now that judges same thing one more time sure as a minister and as the gift that we have we have to stand before the people and remind you of what God's already said we can't bring judgment it's already there you being judged but we're gonna read and just dumb may if we get everything go this is what we don't want and the original says works okay see but watch you know credit daddy's got not give it up but we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth let God judge you but as we preach the word that should be the judge the conviction it's not me going that's like oh that was when we've seen it many times a preacher will go back to get somebody that's they don't want to come to the Oliver I don't agree with that even that's it makes it too full more child help brother I'll sit down all right so you can't go back then get them because the goodness of God leads to repentance you got to look and see that you are lost and God is bringing something to you that's good that's why the most illiterate person can receive the baptism of Holy Ghost he realizes the goodness of God he doesn't have to do the do's and don'ts okay because we'll read it maybe in them I think I haven't in the scripture with the third seal maybe not I would look at these come in yet today or last night but I may not have put it in there but I'm not judged by preacher I just told you that preacher can't judge you he just tells you what the words already say it he just said - what words already say it and then where does the conviction come it comes on you by what he said okay that's what Paul is saying he's saying man you always standing up Peter you inexcusable man so there's no excuse you inexcusable preachers are preaching a false doctrine just for the blackness of this a a blackness of that black horse rider is so bad because everybody will read this afternoon everybody thinks that their life is like but if the Bible says if your life be darkness how great is that darkness when you think it's like when you think you made the Christ and you're worshipping the devil that's the worst you can take I'm gonna be playing horse homosexual you can take them the most vile people in the world it's not as bad as that because that's a spirit anointing them to do that with their flesh but if you ever got that soul converted say oh it doesn't mean that all that goes away right you still remember youth they don't know when your body we bear the marks of sin right because of all of it but inside we're claiming member the one that they breath round pray for the drops you the prostitute Jude the drunk but God saved her what was her name Rosella Street prostitute drunk got saved or so now she's testifying now they don't render what she done right but if she is born again where you gonna put her she didn't do gender an assault our body did that's why we have down barriers in divorce when we make number that it's that something I believe in the third seals were rather round really saw the grace of marriage and divorce because your husband's gonna be dead black dead in order for you to marry cross all right so you gotta be like brother whoever brother once said you gonna be zeroed out all right but what's Paul talking about Paul talking about spirits I go back to that example where brother Branham discerned this guy walk and do them room that he was committing adultery he had an adulterous spirit my brother around listen brother Graham didn't see a vision if he installed vision even know what to do because he didn't ever seen the vision of him with another woman he just saw there was a spirit riding with that guy as he walked through the room okay he attacks this they'll do that well then brother branham remember he talks with him and he says he said I went on further loudly what God done God showed him the vision come see brother Branham was getting ready to judge by when he saw and I believe God said he's not committing adultery against his wife he's messing with organized religion and that is the same level that produces all these back here reprobate mind been righteousness fornicators wickedness covetousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whispers that's all done by spirit it's just manifested through your body okay Cain committed murder again stable when he did not take Abel's way of doing things which was God's Way because God was what pleased with that so there wasn't a there was a now remember the Holy Spirit went back there when I say Holy Spirit people didn't have the Holy Spirit but he did have an anointing of the spiritual part of him that God accepted what he accepted his channel of worship and he told Ganga feel worship like your brother you'll be fine what he came to Cain has spirit on him that wouldn't let him do that because we're going to look at the black of what was the blackness of Cain sure it was that it wasn't anyone out from the presence of God that's the manifestation but the whole problem was is that he accepted his way instead of God's way right and he was not repentant and he didn't have a sorrowful have acute lower heat this afternoon so Cain was more Cain was just like us he was more worried about his own self then he was he just killed Abel and he said God this is more not better so see what I mean what we need to do is that I think the thinking of this here it's the goodness of God that leads to repentance so if God can if if this person these people person can see God through you see our problem is as we go judging everybody else okay well then remember if we joined everybody else just me to run back to you the same all right and when it's meted back to you the same God told me said if you can't forgive your brother I can't forgive you and forgive ya forget it no we can't forget it well we sure can forgive so that's the rough part of this you saw I'm not in that group over there the covetous travelers them but what about that ideas you got this against the Word of God same demon same devil you say even with the Holy Ghost even with the whole ego come that's in your soul when you raise a new reasoning in your your five middle senses right okay yes for your reasoning out because remember God no reason with itself God don't argue with this hell the reason we argue with God is goes around here in this memories and cons of things okay you said are you done yeah we argue with God every day why may you why'd it happen to me what are you doing that way and Paul is saying look guys you're inexcusable because then people are what they're just manifesting what they're doing in their flesh and you're harboring the same spirit in your spirit that's what he's saying cuz of you Jackie look but we are sure that the judgment of God so you think about the gun the judgment of God in the cording countries against them which commit such things and think it's now this cold land still come my god then just then which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of God you will not are despised down the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of God leads thee to Reformation in the original let's read five now you read that I read this the boon Michael love it up here according to the hardness listen this is the problem herein lies our problem our problem is is we justify the spirits that we have I do you can meet what are you doing out there you do but what is it it's hardness and impenitent heart let's look at that word of thing Dada it many no change of mind unrepented now how in the world can you live a Christian life without repentance that's why I ask time to forgive you don't mean dealing with to a situation of the thing we just really end this that down and just forgive each other right but ask God to forgive me but I had to ask you to forgive me complete we were having enough Colley we have a problem bad it was all she done okay what I'm after first off accompanied by - oh she doesn't know it was something she done and I reacted wrong so this problem was it okay when we make them but after the harness and antenna don't know what forgiveness here and they say y'all they believe you might think I'm saying something there even I'm not same way with God because we got withdraws itself from you cuz we're supposed to have relationship with God right well when we have a problem I said we have a probably you don't ever go wrong we have a problem what do we do pull yourself away right God who are you well he's right where you left right and that's what Paul is saying goes watch it's gonna keep going we won't get to the hall today the pole is gonna bring us right back into to them to by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor immortality and eternal life Paul always gives you a way out God always give you a way out man but you got to go through those steps so when you give them a headache died you said I've never been mad at God yeah even then again yeah God why did you when you say why the god you're in your you're in the devil's playground right there right why God well don't ask you what thank you Lord and let me realize what you're doing because I want to have that intimate relationship with you begin right okay that's why we read the other day that the things that we see there in verse 1 the things that we see in our life has to creepiness to Christian people even is to unchristian but as to Christian people husband wife walk too much the Bible said it should be as Christ and the church or the body right right the way you treat your wife the way you treat your husband same thing alright I'm at four you said here's an example of how we go through our day and walk alive when we have our problems but remember we are finite and god's infinite so the argument that we had was an argument we have God won't argue so I say when you say why the God is he's like go back over there you need to rethink this thing delano why and me alright cuz you know what he's gonna do he's gonna say read what I already wrote okay I already put in its contract dear read this read what I wrote but most of the people don't religious people now that you are not having to do this in your flesh but what you have in you is the same thing that those the whole list yes that's why I don't wanna be judged by my work if I put myself in Christ he's already been judging I don't have to be jealous today okay not sure there's a judgment of be studying the body was a good bet that is correct but that is not in yourself it doesn't mean whether you were literally turn or a big eternal no you're just an eternal is gone even if you want again okay God don't he's not a respecter of person I will read unjust men but after the hardness and impenitent heart there's a problem after our hardness and impenitent our unrepentant heart treasures up unto thyself wrath against her there's what you doing baby but after the hardness and dependent of our treasure is white look it's like oh that was always said it's true we do the same thing with God you get mad at your wife than you you just build this case up you know you just build this thing up and then boy you're ready to come in and just let her have it or she get ready to let you have it and then you see the love so when love projects grace takes over you mean you don't worry about all that so what you're doing is if you have a hard and infinite heart you're laying up treasures them to thyself wrath against the damn wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God who will render to every man according to his deeds or the Bible says we will award to each according to his works I look to them goodbye patience know what do them goodbye patient patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and the immortality and eternal life in other words we'll have problems but we still got to strive have patience because he's inserting this for us no watch but then he goes back to verse 8 but unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish upon every soul oh man - do the people on the Jews first notion of the Gentile let's read the Greek had non life indeed to those verse 7 who by perseverance and good works are seeking for glory and honor and incorruptibility but indignation and wrath to those who are fatuous and obey not the truth but obey unrighteousness legend and distress on every soul of man working evil first of the Jews and then at the Greek look look verse 10 the glory and honor and peace to everyone working good to the Jew first and also the Gentile now what's he doing remember Paul speaking to the Romans the Romans are Gentiles Romans are not Jews the Romans are Gentile the next time back to the Jews first because Christ came to the Jews first and then rejected him now he's going to the Greeks are the Gentiles verse 11 very plain for there is no particular allottee God he doesn't pick this one I'll make this one better than the other one all right you can't because it can't be a righteous joke if he does what's right okay okay far as many as halves and without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law let me read verse 12 again therefore as many as sinned without local parish also without law and as many as stand under the law will be judged by the law now he's fixing to interpolate the you verse 13 now he's going to interpolate this hole now the word fifth thing see the quotation so he's interpolate he's in interjecting a thought to help you understand them before and after so now excuse me for me doing this they believe we're gonna have no wife let's take out thirteen fourteen big thing whereas many have sinned without long job so perish without law and as many as have sinned in the home shall be judged by the law in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel then he leaves a lot he leaves are thought to be desired there so what it's going to do God brings the thought of Paul and he's going to explain it right here in 1314 beeping that's the interval interpolating part Paul is not interpreting he's interpolating he's what he's stopping to make sure that you understand the point and he's giving you a few other little pointers to understand what God said we're not the hearers of the law are just before God but the doers of the law shall be justified for when the Gentiles which have not to LA cuz remember Gentiles no more the law do by Nature look there's a lot of things that the Gentiles did by nature that was in the Torah that Jews are not supposed to do they just didn't do it just like one brother Brown said about the statue of a perfect man he said there's a lot of what people have these virtues now they're not godly virtue but they have the human part of that and don't even a not even born again so the Gentiles but see that doesn't that didn't make the Gentiles right so you see what I'm saying just because you live a good and I see that and he just it burns in my heart I I saw it over a couple in the airport the other day when we were going to Arizona and what they were you know they were probably in their eighties but I mean they were just so lovey-dovey and oh just you know getting together and said and smiling and talking not you know what God you probably give them a good life but if they're not born again they're both may end up in hell I stripped away together so it's not the goodness of the Gentiles hmm come to Gentile hey listen the Jews lived along one got never lost so the wall has no strength in it Nepali tell us that later on okay mmm it was weak while I was ill all week it beat on this guy okay you can get in the stall and change that person if you let him change that person for when the Gentiles let's have enough to law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not too long our law to themselves so they've made your own law right we show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another so let's read the Little Miss read the Greek verse thirteen we're not the hearers of law are just before God but the doers of law will be justified when therefore now remember you be justified and not be born again it's ready because you will be there will be a group of people guys by law because remember the law was good before Christ came all those in the Old Testament lived under the law but that's due to know who that verse 14 when therefore those Gentiles not having a law naturally perform the things of the law these though they do not possess a law our law to themself okay demonstrate the work of the law written on their hearts their conscience Khoa testing what that word is ATP is int and the reasoning between each other accusing are defending now you paste the thought back that in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men hearts by what by Jesus Christ don't agree this right here then in the day when according to my glad tidings God will judge in things of men through Christ Jesus now watch what he done he took all first sixteen verses and put it in one verse right because God is gonna judge the secrets and that's when he stole my way up there did I tell my wife I listen it's not a secret I stay another day you know if you if you out your workshop and and your doors open you you know gobernador you thinker you stump your toe and you say that the mad word you know and your neighbor hears you well that's not a witness but what more if there was no way around than you said it God hurt you right see so what I'm saying is that's a secret it ain't a secret if you sit on your front porch and drink the twelve like a beer I mean your neighbor sees you that's not as either but if you got something in your refrigerator and I'm just drawing like this is natural think I'm gonna you understand I'm talking about spiritual things that we hide because remember we are controlled by spirits I want us to realize that we're hmm if you don't get anything from these seals get one thing there's not a horse running through your life you'd understand one thing they're not a natural horse riding through your life is it they'll give you power in the day one guard to adjust the secret square thanks brother and today when God shall judge the secrets of men by who Jesus Christ according to my gospel look how positive he was don't you two realize something what was inside of his gospel he didn't say the secrets of men hearts active Jesus came and 90% of the world never knew well 99% of the world never knew you'd fall ones 99% of the people never heard he's gone at that time and the time he wrote that is man you got to go back to the time he wrote it once he was writing it now not now that's when all over the world machines prophesy good look if you take this Bible too much there's this one do you take this Bible all over the country today people are preaching now that Bible in there Peter if they preaching a false doctrine they're gonna be judged by what Paul just said okay surely so we if we don't get it correct get those little demons of whatever happened the whole they are called a Jew and rest us in the law and make us not boast in God and know if it will and approve is the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the law no watch any reason maintain and knoweth didn't will induce discern superior thing this is verse 18 notices will improve the things that are more excellent way and dust desert superior things being instructed out of the law no words the law is good but but what are they doing his will is is your be instructed out of the law okay you're being instructed now what am I saying we're not living under the wall right now if you're born again you've come out from under the law and you're under grace but now there is a group of evil then we'll be doing is under the law okay now watch verse 19 and has to believe their self to be a guide of the blind and lot of those in darkness an instructor of the foolish a teacher of bait which has the form of knowledge and of truth in the law and the reason hearing what an instructor of the simple a teacher of babes having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law does out then 321 you will stop right about 22 if you'll recall you watch it's thought that rent talks in hill interpolate and a man he'll start on something and something else which I would put a chapter in there but you know I don't know how they did that but you know what God didn't ask me I went born that's me like a man struck to the foolish teacher Basil's have formed knowledge and truth the law verse 22 now thou art staying do not commit adultery dost thou commit adultery oh no I never touched the woman no I don't go back to 21 everyday just about men who are teaching another not instruct when we're preaching the gospel we're getting it to okay now who are preaching do not steal that's now steal you saw I've never I don't steal time don't think when we have to miss onion peel the layers you say naw don't steal we did not steal it in your life and I'm going out bucks hell wide open that's what they're gonna do they're gonna stand up on a day of judgment this is what's gonna happen and they're gonna say God I didn't steal okay god I did and they're gonna be a checklist of things that they're gonna say I didn't do this I didn't do them but there's gonna be one thing whatever it is it's gonna be one thing and God's gonna say you disbelieve me doesn't matter this big laundry list of things that I did not do and even the big laundry list of the things they didn't do God's gonna say I came to you on a certain certain day and I'm presenting myself to you and you turn me down that's all it's gonna be it's not gonna be you know God's not gonna send a friend go now Bob black you didn't and you did and you didn't and you didn't know he's gonna say you remember that day that I came to you and you tames actually where everybody in the world he's got to come to is not they need to expect a person then he'll say did you turn me down right a jig second and you'll just bow your head and you'll say I turned you down because you'll know when you know and your safety and your person you turned you down well there's your judgment not that you did this and the whole laundry list of things right the dudes it somewhere break down brother around what is sin smoking drinking gambling cussing running around no no those it's disbelieving God's Word and he'll say that day you disbelieve that that was me coming to you and therefore judgment is nobody claps because what happens is when you do that unbelief all those other things are just attributes remember brother Graham said those are attributes of sin sand in the bottom line and a red coral yesterday I don't think I brought it hey brother I was talking about something he's making a comment to somebody and what about that but he was talking about unbelief he said y'all say all these things whatever we're talking my preachers doing this don't do that y'all saying all these things he said it boils down to either you blaspheme the holy though oh he was talking about somebody come to him and said well what about these women that are doing abortions and stuff like that they they sold their soul they Bluff he said no he said no that's not true he said the only thing they're gonna be judged by for when they turn the word down or not if you're a word rejecter work rejecters go to hell if your word of objective then that come to the time where that means you blacks being on young black men with all because it's the only way that you will not make it to heaven yeah you saw no telling you my brother Brown said he said don't worry about all this all I was hooking up last night it was about this we're talking about Saul committing suicide so didn't commit suicide but even brother I'm talking about people committing suicide we're not lost they could have a demon attach themselves to the person's spirit make you do things that well you know let's just be honest we think I've seen in my life older people that were I I feel we're born-again Christians but when they come down to be about 90 years old in their life but their brother the message he just got this spirit of cussin and what's being mean and but that wasn't him see that was that body that was that spirit realm that had overcome and they took over in this realm and so you don't you really don't that's enough they see you'd say well I judge that man he's going go to hell no he's on throwing it on the black it's just that he lost his mind what about the brother the brother Ramsay God come on Christian man those can get some six-pack of beer and just in other words he continually he let his spirit get on him and he didn't want to get it off of him so God said look you can't walk around this community with a beer in your hand you're my child I'm taking you home you know why do you did the best thing you could have done what's took that man home right okay he could blast me in the Holy Ghost so God wasn't away keep going keep going keep going with that spirit honey so let the Lord judge and let the work [Music]
