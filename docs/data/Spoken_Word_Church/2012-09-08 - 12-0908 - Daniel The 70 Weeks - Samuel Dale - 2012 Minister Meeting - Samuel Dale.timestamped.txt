[6:19] individual and his name is Jesus Rory
[6:22] that's what we come together or we don't

[6:27] honor of a man but just a man
[6:31] president this morning as we started off
[6:35] brother Samuel Dale that you want to go
[6:38] first or are your soon whether Samsung
[6:41] start off and we're talking about Daniel
[6:44] 70 weeks the whole purpose of this is to
[6:46] Daniel's understanding gang of 70 weeks
[6:49] and this is the first time we have
[6:51] recorded any of the ministers meetings
[6:56] and the purpose of that of this is
[6:58] because it's very much of teaching setup
[7:02] so with teaching we've got some brothers
[7:05] that desire to be here for the bill has
[7:08] already mentioned the two brothers and
[7:10] they have supported the meetings and
[7:12] they could not be here so they have
[7:14] requested to get recording and also the
[7:18] speakers were the salmon or the wages
[7:20] are how these recorded for posterity so
[7:23] that if somebody says we you said so and
[7:26] so we can pull it up and say this is
[7:28] what to say it so that's the reason it's
[7:32] being recorded we don't completely
[7:33] normally recording with that may be
[7:35] changing is as a mistress region has
[7:38] moved forward so you ready brother Rick

[7:43] together and readers Richard get readily
[7:48] into the topic I have a bunch of quote
[7:52] here if any of you want there will be
[7:54] the exact quote should we be using today
[7:56] so if you want you could pack them out
[7:59] not enough for everybody
[8:01] there is a few that you can do let this
[8:04] do as the Prophet said nobody heaven

[8:18] praise song has blessed us now your

[8:28] recorded in your loving grace in Jesus
[8:30] now Wade Guthrie you may be seated wake
[8:34] up you're reporting the reader scripture
[8:36] comes tasting wake up record want to go
[8:38] off the internet think that their
[8:40] brother and Iran has been released
[8:52] are in James hey okay everybody for me
[8:58] it was Richard here at the Daniel 9 24
[9:02] 70 weeks are determined upon my people
[9:04] on that holy city to finish the
[9:07] transgression to make the end of sins
[9:09] and to make reconciliation for iniquity
[9:10] and bring in everlasting righteousness
[9:12] and civil division and profits into the
[9:15] north of of holy know therefore and
[9:17] understand that from the going forth of
[9:19] the commandment to restore and to build
[9:21] jerusalem unto messiah the prince shall
[9:23] be seven weeks and threescore and two
[9:26] weeks the stream shall be built again
[9:28] and the wall even in troublous times
[9:31] actually restored to which of his hobby
[9:34] cut off not for himself but not for
[9:38] himself and the people of the prince
[9:40] that shall come shall destroy the city
[9:43] in the sanctuary in the end thereof
[9:45] shall be with the flood and at the end
[9:47] of the war desolations are determined
[9:49] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[9:51] many for one week and the midst of the
[9:53] week he shall cause the sacrifice and
[9:55] the oblation deceased and for the
[9:57] overspreading of abominations he shall
[9:59] make it desolate even unto the
[10:02] consummation and that determined shall
[10:04] be poured upon the desolate and you may
[10:08] be Z now the first thing I don't like is
[10:11] mine and one we bought one message I
[10:16] thought hey me we have one absolute
[10:22] which is the word and we believe the one
[10:25] that brought us the word to be the
[10:28] Prophet this in huh so what he says it
[10:33] does matter with me what you say or what
[10:36] outside right all right guess what he
[10:39] said
[10:40] all right I think what we got to say
[10:43] about we are sheep we have no rights
[10:48] what brother up to you what I think
[10:50] that's what will get through and go into
[10:52] the message and show it that that's what
[10:55] a lot of people get your own ideas I
[10:56] mean when they do if it's a messy profit
[11:01] ok if not but I do not want to try to
[11:05] correct anybody know there's no way for
[11:08] us to correct this message was made to
[11:11] live a not correct just to say I'm going
[11:16] to correct you I know what is taught not
[11:21] we're all still learning but just keep
[11:25] that in mind out of what we're trying to
[11:26] do is to look at it and remember he was
[11:32] the prophet but around the message is
[11:35] supposed to be our absolute right and
[11:39] then we must believe what he says no
[11:43] matter what we think because you know
[11:47] yourself that run arounds message was
[11:50] contrary to our understanding i would
[11:55] say ninety percent of us but i do this
[11:57] to win 200 for him then because we
[12:00] didn't know right there in the truth the
[12:04] latter we were one is your Trinity we
[12:06] were still missing it yeah it didn't
[12:09] matter what I you were missing it until
[12:10] the Prophet Kenny so then when we read
[12:13] what the Prophet says
[12:14] take what he said even though it don't
[12:17] mathematically count even though it
[12:20] don't physically look right it has to be
[12:24] that point so then let's do this is take
[12:27] what we can and try to you know if I say
[12:31] kinds there contrary to you I'm not
[12:36] contrary to nobody I didn't come to
[12:38] argue i come to state what I believe all
[12:42] right now here's the problem i see with
[12:44] the ministry most preachers men tell you
[12:47] fully what they believe because they
[12:50] will withhold enough until they can
[12:52] float around and I don't everybody knows
[12:55] me I'm glowing I'm flying if you like it
[13:00] time if you don't like it you pray for
[13:02] me come I accuse what I gotta work them
[13:05] God's Word is the truth though carefully
[13:08] dumb donkey tail today that's right it's
[13:11] not rude right a monic now in doing the
[13:14] Atlas let's just make a few little
[13:17] statements and just give some things
[13:21] starting he said well why is it so
[13:24] important for us to understand Daniel
[13:26] seventy weeks you know do we have to
[13:29] understand it well maybe all of us
[13:36] movement don't have to understand the
[13:38] total mechanical but if it was not meant
[13:42] for us understanding why would it be
[13:43] brought yes can I
[13:47] all right and I'm going to make a
[13:49] statement like there's people that tell
[13:51] you all about the seagulls and can't
[13:54] tell you about that insinuate sure now
[13:59] let's read what the prophet said so
[14:00] let's start with quote number one unless
[14:03] they want to see it now if I don't read
[14:06] the whole thing you read it all walks up
[14:07] there I'll just get washed up raised up
[14:10] than you you know you do it revelation
[14:13] this apartment of 71 that Gables
[14:16] instruction now to unless a this well
[14:20] i'll be using the tendon of the two
[14:22] thousand converts okay the computer
[14:24] verbs of 2010 all right now there is
[14:28] some differences between the 2010 and
[14:30] the 99 the parents are different not
[14:35] necessarily wording but even they change
[14:37] some words it's different but you will
[14:40] use this because that was to get us home
[14:43] to the internet system it's easier to
[14:46] use because the brewers talking to that
[14:49] list alright well look what he says in
[14:52] revelation 6 190 21 is connected with
[14:55] the city of weeks and therefore we must
[14:58] stop and explain before we go further we
[15:00] must gotta explain one of these 70 of
[15:02] weeks cause if you don't you miss those
[15:05] seals like I said everybody knows all
[15:09] about sales but don't know about daniel
[15:12] said you ate well how can you do that is
[15:17] that too hard I didn't say it he said
[15:21] you missed the seagull if you missed the
[15:23] trumpet you missed the bottle you mr.
[15:25] play you missed three unclean spirits
[15:26] like frogs the three roads the caching
[15:29] down red dragon the woman in the Sun you
[15:31] miss it all because it don't cut
[15:33] here in this 70th we go it takes place
[15:37] right here and it's ending if we that's
[15:40] where it takes place now everybody knows
[15:44] the first CEO bought viable product oh
[15:48] yeah what was wrong what do you
[15:54] understand what he just said he just
[15:59] said we can't understand the sweet on to
[16:01] understand and seventy weeks now so then
[16:07] what are we trying to do we say well is
[16:10] it important i believe all the first
[16:15] important anytime and then you'll say
[16:18] bro brother Dale and will give a drawing
[16:22] of a second well I take what run around
[16:25] and said I to the seal clubber over what
[16:30] he said before the road you know are the
[16:33] 70 weeks now are you the problem no not
[16:39] dinner so we have no rocky you can make
[16:43] that statement because if you say we
[16:46] take after the seals you know that means
[16:50] you believe before the ceiling was not
[16:51] correct right now let's read what better
[16:56] have said about ninety seventy weeks who
[16:58] had not to look what he says and I do
[17:06] not believe that there's one person here
[17:08] for that perfect I believe that we're
[17:10] here or not because we're deadly sincere
[17:12] honest and wanting to know thus saith
[17:16] the Lord now that was wished on 60 per
[17:22] paragraph 22 go to the end I told him
[17:26] kid that coming up your ass if I get
[17:27] started with say not see if I move on to
[17:29] another
[17:30] go down Tom I gotta get in a hurry if I
[17:34] get it by forwarding a to my
[17:35] father oh look what he said well he gets
[17:38] to on further one can that's the reason
[17:40] we're praying for God to make that so
[17:42] perfect then that there are be not one
[17:45] shadow out the god murder nosipho put
[17:48] our own interpretation to those things
[17:50] it's got to come through the SAT the
[17:52] Lord so I'm leaving it right there until
[17:55] I understand Ned this is off of the 70th
[18:04] week that much my say on the old the 99
[18:07] version like those say the same in weeks
[18:09] of that right but when you get into the
[18:14] 2010 it's at the 70th week those that
[18:18] still even covers seventy weeks of
[18:20] Daniel but when they've done this 2010
[18:23] version the freedom emphasize on that
[18:25] where you won't say he's using something
[18:27] different this is the version so look
[18:29] what he said perfect 191 the safety of
[18:32] we condemn I wish you'd listened quietly
[18:35] now just for a moment the moment he
[18:38] starts the cydia tweak or seven years
[18:40] the church is done now listen I'm
[18:44] quoting again recording so you won't
[18:46] forget this is what the Holy Spirit put
[18:49] up on my pen while I was riding when he
[18:54] says it must be thus said the Lord yeah
[18:57] and he said they put on his hand that
[18:59] about we gladly accept voting her
[19:01] original seat when he said oh dear Tony
[19:03] pick up my
[19:04] right we accept that at being the staff
[19:06] the Lord but do we accept this is being
[19:09] ok now let's go to the net let's see
[19:13] what you actually said these things are
[19:15] paragraph 14 understand me is weak now
[19:18] today and we're approaching what is the
[19:20] 70 weeks this is a very bottom part the
[19:23] 70 weeks and we know that the scripture
[19:26] cannot lie we have to be true and if the
[19:29] same angel Gabriel coming to manually
[19:32] the terms only 70 weeks left for the
[19:34] Jews then we would apply that to six
[19:37] days or seven day week but in prophecy
[19:41] it's always feel incredible right yes
[19:47] right you remember Matthew 1334 all
[19:52] things were spoke Jesus unto the
[19:55] multitude in parables and without a
[19:57] parable speaking on to them so the whole
[20:02] message is in permanent amen the whole
[20:05] bottle isn't her say me weeks is in
[20:08] power so now what is a hard thing but
[20:14] the definition of apparel is a figure of
[20:16] comparison the proverb they placing them
[20:20] one thing by the side of another due to
[20:22] this potion will affect us at work which
[20:24] means it's outside and off ships invalid
[20:28] way to get some of these other words
[20:30] when he gets up but the best definition
[20:33] you can define of apparel is like the
[20:36] silence they said teach other stairs
[20:40] Jesus would give up early but you know
[20:44] what do you have next line man that's
[20:46] right what do you mean you plant leaves
[20:49] you get beings run you know the
[20:54] Pharisees kind of figured out Jesus
[20:55] don't nothing that's right you know
[20:58] the next on matters the Americans a long
[21:02] story go to crops with an underlying
[21:06] meaning that can even be a little
[21:08] different then the meaning over here
[21:12] you'll see in a minute on the drawing
[21:14] government said this line should have
[21:15] went straight across that Israel but
[21:17] then you see the church age is injected
[21:19] by joe parr now so we're going to take
[21:23] dance in which is apparent join we say
[21:27] my name 10 remember the prophet is
[21:31] speaking in prayer to hide it from the
[21:34] wise and prove that's right and here's
[21:38] the statements a lot of you know it even
[21:40] a brother just recently put out a big
[21:42] high pony that contain you 70 weeks was
[21:45] so messed up in the dates and the night
[21:46] until you can't understand well he's not
[21:51] the prophet amen we just really gonna
[21:55] run City so what God put on his pin we
[21:58] just read is coming to set the Lord to a
[22:00] prophet or what's becoming right now
[22:03] don't know get them within their own way
[22:07] you said well though they was thankful
[22:09] around in understanding the only thing
[22:14] he didn't understand was the wipers
[22:16] rider my authenticity and then no lot of
[22:24] they were shining so he wouldn't
[22:26] responsible to seal throat okay you were
[22:30] not responsible for that white horse
[22:32] rider GT is being wrong until the seals
[22:36] broke then he was responsible that's
[22:37] right huh that's why said you say what I
[22:40] say I'm responsible alright so the
[22:44] output in the ports along the way like
[22:45] that but if you know
[22:46] mm I just like to say funny this is not
[22:49] a new doctrine to me this is 40 years a
[22:51] priestess in 1974 still have the cage
[22:54] and we do have some types priest in 2005
[22:58] if you want you can take them and listen
[23:01] to them dissectum Tarla do whatever I
[23:06] would just listen if you want you don't
[23:08] want to forget that's just you know it's
[23:11] just one won't them taking let's get
[23:13] started look what the prophet said the
[23:17] reason this is done why is it done in
[23:19] parables was it done you know that these
[23:22] are that you why is it like 28 days in
[23:24] some months and 31 days in the next
[23:27] month and different times he's in the
[23:29] same delete Savannah right why is his
[23:32] done under way notice what he say but
[23:34] that was all done than the great economy
[23:36] of God to keep the church Washington
[23:38] pray being ready having their garments
[23:41] washed in the blood of the Lamb you mean
[23:45] God would deliberately do that yes you
[23:49] would deliberately do that Deuteronomy
[23:51] full of the night Deuteronomy everybody
[23:54] knows if 13 1 through 3 are arriving on
[23:56] your prophet or a dream or drink and
[23:58] give it the assign or Wonder and the
[24:01] sign or the wonderful pais where I'll be
[24:04] spake unto thee same let us try for
[24:06] other gosh you remember the two
[24:09] scriptures what they've done Elizabeth
[24:10] they use the wonderful profit prophesied
[24:12] and it comes to pass all right I'm in
[24:16] addition said if it's if he prophesied
[24:18] he gives you a sign that it comes to
[24:20] pious why would God allow that but
[24:26] there's your answer now shall not
[24:28] hearken unto the words of that rock or
[24:29] that dream of dreams for the Lord your
[24:32] God prove with you to know whether you
[24:36] love the Lord your God with all your
[24:37] heart with all your soul that's my time
[24:41] he loves to do that where he is immortal
[24:44] catchy you know that you know he loves
[24:49] to do up something he's gone all right
[24:53] go to the next this tea time immoral
[24:56] I'll give this a point for you to look
[24:58] at the sea and he said he puts these
[25:01] trials he said about the bottom he sends
[25:03] these trials to test you to prove you to
[25:05] shake you up and to give you you about
[25:07] you hope you know somebody else tear you
[25:10] up miss coach belong you know mice won't
[25:14] move in now about 10 and 15 years we
[25:17] have no real big battle all it once
[25:21] we're getting together a few what not
[25:24] stirring all right what do you think
[25:29] about it so now let's go into the day of
[25:32] 70 week with this thought in mind apero
[25:37] the daniel said before hundred and
[25:40] ninety years will really miss Porter not
[25:43] even judicial right all right right now
[25:48] I ask you to check this the only kind of
[25:52] runaround ever talks about 490 years to
[25:55] Israel is in the Daniel 70 week series
[26:01] okay if you can find it out of the head
[26:04] I've gone for 90 years a different in
[26:08] the data seven weeks he explains the 490
[26:11] years but he doesn't do that again cuz
[26:16] it we've done for one time the parable
[26:19] is given for one time for you to break
[26:23] your neck trying to figure it out and
[26:27] the Bible tells you the products that
[26:29] people have gone crazy trying to figure
[26:31] it out oh yeah 490 years do is we get to
[26:38] it in a minute getting an odd comparison
[26:40] that Jesus at any time you forgive
[26:44] seventy times seven of course both to
[26:47] again from and actually all right let's
[26:48] don't leave it on 70 times 7490 colonies
[26:53] isn't in there leaving they asked to
[26:57] have identities most forgiving 409 times
[26:59] without the mask so I that odd the house
[27:02] there'd be four hundred ninety years and
[27:04] there's four hundred ninety years to
[27:06] digital yes and render we're talking
[27:09] about Israel man we're not talking about
[27:11] Gentiles will kill absolutely go ahead
[27:14] brother and pull up to the trauma to the
[27:16] children now I all the copy in my body
[27:23] he now received in 1967 or 1968 in
[27:28] Jeffersonville it is this drawing now
[27:34] there are arguments about that draw be I
[27:39] won't get in trouble voting somebody
[27:41] else oh I won't quote the brother but
[27:45] we've received information stating this
[27:47] was exactly the drawing that brought it
[27:52] out of night like I said I've had months
[27:56] at 67 probably a lot of you have that
[28:00] drawing was there even to the little
[28:03] battle under works at four and thirty
[28:04] four years a little bit of writing
[28:07] according to the brother his wife said
[28:10] she wrote in sometimes so there is
[28:17] another one where the line comes around
[28:20] the lights of circle in BO the man
[28:21] standing there there 77 on the line you
[28:24] probably seen that one there are on now
[28:27] in the Philippines that i'll show you
[28:30] that drawing in just a second not from
[28:32] the filling and then I don't have it
[28:34] from there but it's not you know I'm
[28:37] just saying that they see by the other
[28:38] yours but look like run around and say
[28:41] now you said well we all know who that
[28:43] was great all right now
[28:45] I'm telling you I believe that's wrong
[28:50] is exactly the bottom if you change it
[28:53] in one detail you're not in the
[28:55] scripture amen that is the drawing the
[28:58] Prophet money and that is what he taught
[29:03] so there is your three witnesses as to
[29:06] it being correct all right so now that
[29:09] what it says it's divided into three
[29:16] periods time the same is weaker than you
[29:21] are about 61 I emphasize at the end you
[29:25] look on your book it says sailing with
[29:27] the dining with this is the new version
[29:30] that is the 70th week the cover he says
[29:35] it's three periods first a seven-week
[29:39] period then a three-sport doing period
[29:44] which is 62 noon and then one week
[29:47] period they're divided into three
[29:50] periods till you look at the drawing is
[29:54] divided into three periods and they said
[29:58] we're under that outfit what I believe
[30:03] I'm sorry it didn't fit me when I was in
[30:09] the baggage and that prophet told me I
[30:11] was a bastard born child if I didn't get
[30:13] out of that each you know all right
[30:19] here's what most people think brother
[30:21] random draw if you'll notice I got on
[30:25] better what some people believe if
[30:31] you'll notice from the original draw
[30:33] we'll get back to it he gives 69 weeks
[30:36] to the cross yeah now I'm this drawing
[30:40] the only thing we didn't do grill joke
[30:42] and I'll pointed out of my shirt we
[30:45] should have pulled their
[30:46] over to right here okay because that's
[30:50] what you think the drawing don't you
[30:51] think that's what brother let them talk
[30:53] you think he called 69 five weeks 69
[30:58] weeks use in administering may be thrown
[31:01] out of here and which 16 out of the high
[31:03] then his only 1i wait left over here
[31:08] that's what you've done me said the
[31:12] worst drug and worse the problems Mason
[31:15] chilly one will be ordinary ever say
[31:18] sixty nine and a half weeks to the rock
[31:22] we will show you 69 weeks approach but
[31:27] i'm helena showing because i'm
[31:30] not beach if I'm ride hallelujah brother
[31:37] news if I'm wrong and you grabbed me how
[31:40] are you I will take the wreck but you
[31:45] gonna have shown you about him not your
[31:48] idea but my opinion I don't give a hoot
[31:51] what's your opinion is God don't deal
[31:55] with opinions hey Leo with his word hey
[31:58] alright so that's why people bank run
[32:02] around said they kinda he brought up 62
[32:06] weeks and then Jesus preached three and
[32:08] a half years and then maybe threaten
[32:12] iphone on your side now there will
[32:16] recite this over over but Iran never
[32:19] preached but seven years of Jesus's
[32:22] ministry to relight it back that threw a
[32:26] knife over here and I try but around
[32:28] never preached no word but three and a
[32:32] half years of Jacob's trouble on the
[32:36] tribulation right I want to see huh so
[32:42] that's what people say he was
[32:45] look back up to the original misty
[32:49] verify C divided into three weeks seven
[32:54] wheels 62 weeks 69 he engaged dot out
[33:02] dot out and he sanity he put the cross
[33:06] haiti journey now brother Dale as Ronald
[33:09] much they need 33 look at that second so
[33:20] we'll run around change his mind I want
[33:25] to know for a change I'd go with the
[33:30] nation look there's exactly 49 day 49
[33:37] years rather in the time of the building
[33:40] of the temple then we'll start right to
[33:43] her and say well the Jews according to
[33:46] John it with what a second that John
[33:50] says that you said to Jesus that they
[33:53] would 48 six years in bill in the temple
[33:57] remember that John two and twenty
[34:06] remember Daniel 925 said and the walls
[34:10] and the streets were built yeah it took
[34:14] 40 26 years in the temple park but the
[34:17] finishing of the structure around made
[34:19] it up to 49 years reaching about right
[34:23] see those Jews thought that was smart
[34:26] they thought they understood but did the
[34:31] understand oh they were right
[34:34] technically but they didn't fit the rest
[34:38] of trip see our salad and prophetic
[34:42] weeks in the beliefs of our seven weeks
[34:45] determined to the
[34:46] rebuilding temple and it was building
[34:49] exactly 49 years now are you going to
[34:52] listen to the farae city use with the 46
[34:55] or brother Brennan for the 49 and what I
[34:59] mean by that the Pharisees today they
[35:05] want to tell you okay see March 14th he
[35:12] knows exactly bc 538 until temple was
[35:16] restored again and the streets which
[35:18] restored exactly 4900 so what do you
[35:20] hear what do we get in seven weeks means
[35:23] 49 years then one week equals seven
[35:26] years seven times 749 just exactly our
[35:30] yard now there are no more question
[35:35] about it we know now that each week mid
[35:38] seven years have you got it let's say it
[35:41] together one week equal seven years all
[35:44] right he said well I know these things
[35:48] are no a quick let's get it money he
[35:52] learn about I semester to enjoy an
[35:56] unusual thing now let's get started on
[36:01] something now we're totally going
[36:05] forward progress in the eighth cydia
[36:07] tweak of the commitment that years were
[36:11] work trouble you were troubling now
[36:15] we're totally going for the commandment
[36:17] to rebuild it city to Mossad and Mossad
[36:22] was Christ of course silly seven weeks
[36:25] and threescore two weeks making 69 weeks
[36:30] CRI in 69 x 7 x 69 equal 483 years now
[36:37] you're getting it down if you want way
[36:40] to run over be glad to they worked over
[36:42] the going forth of commandment
[36:44] the city to Messiah shall be seven and
[36:47] then he goes to explain in 249 gonna
[36:50] sell them aside coming up to his part
[36:52] all right go to the name this is
[36:59] paragraph 80 and watch this one now this
[37:04] would be released the men good men
[37:06] conjure but what's the point I gravitate
[37:12] either 70th week of Daniel now now Jesus
[37:15] Messiah wrote into the city of Jerusalem
[37:17] driving on the back of about you on Palm
[37:19] Sunday a millisecond 80 dirty and we'll
[37:24] get to that later he's oh he goofed up
[37:27] there will he goofed up in the seal book
[37:29] and he goofed up in question tonight 64
[37:34] okay we will explain these in the point
[37:38] we can now time are 80 Jesus rode into
[37:42] Jerusalem on Sunday on Sunday of 11
[37:45] Sunday before the crucifixion you're
[37:48] great Palm Sunday and then crucifixion
[37:51] was in that many roads to that Sundy I
[37:54] would say but here in the next week
[37:56] watch that is a second now watch but if
[37:59] we have already seen that's a 69 weeks
[38:02] makes 483 years now that our swear there
[38:05] trouble comes right back we got only
[38:09] with the marking of the bottle time only
[38:11] for 75 years and actually it's 483 years
[38:17] now he didn't sacred moved up he said
[38:20] actually at 483 years right but never
[38:24] survey years and what's the problem now
[38:28] God can't make it hit and if he said he
[38:31] would be so many days and seventh day
[38:32] and said so much it's so much to where
[38:34] we're going to do now the bc 4 75 to 80
[38:38] 30-hour Julian our astronomy
[38:41] earth which is 400 365 before but when
[38:45] we reuse that to our prophetic calendar
[38:49] now watch this mathematical calculation
[38:56] 475 x 365 for 25 which is one-fourth
[39:02] right three other 65 or four days in our
[39:05] calendar 360 noon and comes out I can't
[39:08] be pronounced it won't that be 170 3493
[39:12] for savings up yes that's right up by
[39:15] giving a hundred thousand earth 10,000
[39:17] you read that all right / Horner about
[39:21] 360 you get what he's doing he says we
[39:27] got to go by prophetic counter you
[39:31] divide that by 360 and look how close
[39:35] brother Brennan was terminally
[39:37] mathematica he was 480 1.9 2708 33333 43
[39:46] in other words 482 year yeah yeah he
[39:50] said well he still needs to the year
[39:52] thank you the calendar was challenged
[39:57] three-count a mean the counters of niche
[40:02] NE Gregory what is the other Alexandria
[40:08] mystery other in one year they had 13
[40:12] months to make the start line back up
[40:14] when they change the calendar in another
[40:16] year they had 200
[40:18] 30-something days in that year to make
[40:21] the calendars on it so brother Alan was
[40:24] walking even mathematically was one year
[40:27] off the one against it now he said gods
[40:32] did put into prophetic calendar it's 483
[40:37] right they read it right there but here
[40:41] on the court 75 and actually it's for an
[40:45] 83 so whatever we think I just give you
[40:50] these calendars and thanks to have you
[40:51] mind God what's your mind over say the
[40:55] Prophet said it you know right see they
[41:01] ought to be done that way all right now
[41:06] let's go to where we gonna do a mission
[41:10] 1 ok let's go to this this is part of 86
[41:17] there's new day to day four yep I my
[41:23] 34th and our prophetic calendar brains
[41:29] do witches and continuation are coming
[41:32] down for more retrieved and I am very
[41:33] vain and our prophetic calendar right in
[41:37] 30 60 days that we use down the
[41:40] scripture we have exactly one or 83
[41:43] years 30 of 43 here we have exactly
[41:46] proved by the Prophet proof of the
[41:47] prophecy exactly the truth are from the
[41:51] economy going forward to build a temple
[41:53] on
[41:53] destroying our when they rejected Christ
[41:57] and killed him in a t-33 now he just
[42:03] said the quote before then he wrote into
[42:06] Jerusalem on Sunday per second maybe 30
[42:10] now if you've words later what does he
[42:15] say see now but the point he is getting
[42:19] that and didn't they rejected Christ and
[42:21] kill him in a t-33 when Christ was
[42:23] killed in exactly four to make three
[42:25] years yes while another drawing was at
[42:27] them people say well he come in here at
[42:30] 80 30 in India crucified 1933 but you
[42:41] see church what is
[42:43] look at your phone to rebuild the temple
[42:45] 434 years and for 34 years of a 49
[42:49] things exactly 483 years the 480
[42:52] threefold four and eight forward so you
[42:57] know what that English get hit on my
[42:59] nose fine so now though go to a number
[43:08] which is a continuation paragraph he
[43:11] said numbers continue an 84 in two days
[43:13] it and God had an Olympian and the
[43:16] living world is toward the water a
[43:18] change you're on a date and then let the
[43:20] Romans come in and make up the calendar
[43:22] which hits and jumps and so forth and
[43:24] guess that in even in the encyclopedia
[43:27] where I've been reading I throw out the
[43:30] calendar get everything doing what
[43:31] you're doing reading between to all be
[43:33] there there it is exactly one day three
[43:36] years from the going forth of the
[43:39] commandment to restore and to restore
[43:40] and build till the time of the Messiah
[43:43] was rejected with 483 years by the
[43:49] calendar now whether you think it or not
[43:54] you got to stop and watch say 483 years
[44:00] if you add three and a half years to
[44:03] that you're 486 and a half it will
[44:08] calculate so now we got to find that one
[44:12] calculate go back to paragraph eight
[44:17] wrote it a little bit harder they all
[44:24] right now Jesus Messiah run into the
[44:27] city of Jerusalem come from the back
[44:28] what you up on sandy hey Ellis Adam
[44:31] maybe 30 he said well he just goofed up
[44:38] did you give them
[44:42] before we show the other part let's just
[44:44] really he gives down now remember hey I
[44:48] was sad part of sunday money would be
[44:54] the third Tuesday would be the fourth
[44:59] remember that neck as he told up okay we
[45:12] going up to 20 hi I appreciate he
[45:17] broached do anything but I can do not
[45:19] lead anyway but look what brother Ron
[45:21] Cey questions answered on the seals 1963
[45:26] after six had been briefed he says and
[45:30] you know that Jesus was flying about
[45:32] 1830 is that right he was about the
[45:36] middle of the year I he s leading 30 and
[45:39] the Bible said that he was flying before
[45:41] the foundation work no no go to the
[45:45] mansion look what he said on the sixth
[45:48] seal prior 148 now let's go there these
[45:55] three persisting who you know what he's
[45:57] answered the asking three questions and
[45:59] eventually right actually on Tuesday
[46:03] afternoon April of 4th 83rd who did he
[46:15] give about earning a difficult here go
[46:20] to look at what I told you remember the
[46:23] other one said he wrote into Jerusalem
[46:24] on Palm Sunday haila saket now he's
[46:27] saying april afford all right mind you
[46:30] would have been the third tuesday would
[46:32] have been there for blood runs exactly
[46:36] right he said yo how can that be a 30s
[46:42] and all of us at the other arm go ahead
[46:44] we've got that somewhere there it is
[46:48] your timeline comparison if you would
[46:51] take that we'd be glad to give it to you
[46:54] see our calendar system is all mixed up
[46:58] we started at one in Kenya Jesus would
[47:04] hold on and I'm saying whoa love you
[47:06] this is my quote run around never say it
[47:08] Jesus with 14 BC he never said but if he
[47:15] say he was crucified 1830 then you can
[47:22] argue point but look he according to the
[47:28] theologians and scholars and whatever
[47:30] you want all that we have it well you
[47:32] can take it away Testament so look at it
[47:35] one line runs in the college I started 0
[47:38] the other one life runs in the cross of
[47:40] doing so a 830 according to Jesus born
[47:45] for bixi run around with give me the
[47:48] Jesus was crucified Navy third right

[47:57] Jesus being crucified 8033 Joey's it
[48:00] exactly right so you can say thirty or
[48:03] thirty 30 in which calendar you you
[48:06] going to which system you're using to
[48:08] prove your point right save-a-lot phone

[48:15] hain't blue second of 18 before that he
[48:18] done he knew exactly what he was doing

[50:47] about 23 he thought that that huge not
[50:53] our had nothing to do with us under
[50:54] forty four thousand oh they are not in
[50:57] the third chapter they're over in the
[50:59] scripture father and now we see that all
[51:02] this stuff wasn't that place went over
[51:04] in this time of the 70th week the last
[51:09] week now we already had 69 weeks now
[51:18] they already had 59 week including
[51:23] exactly the way God said they didn't

[51:36] weight 77 here so here's what people
[51:40] miss them and so are you trying to say
[51:44] that there is one week left you know
[51:48] seven years but rather dig the remedies
[51:58] according to his drawing he did it
[52:00] according to the Bible Daniel 9 35 26 to
[52:05] me salad and they all know that words if
[52:12] you confirm his chemical wheels because
[52:14] a double come down meaning it means
[52:16] crossing at me
[52:17] the anti-graft because i'll ask you a
[52:19] question where did God ever like a
[52:21] covenant for seven years now you run
