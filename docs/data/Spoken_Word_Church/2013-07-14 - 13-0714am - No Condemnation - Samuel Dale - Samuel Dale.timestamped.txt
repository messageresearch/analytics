[6:23] somewhere in there and anyhow he's doing
[6:26] better but he said keep praying for him
[6:28] that the Lord would touch him so
[6:29] remember remember them any other
[6:30] announcements I generally forget
[6:32] something amen so let's pray father we
[6:35] thank you for this day and we ask you
[6:37] now that you would just guide us as we
[6:39] try to speak about you and just come
[6:41] Among Us Lord and manifest yourself
[6:43] because you said you sent your word and
[6:46] healed us and delivered us from
[6:47] destruction and we thank you and we
[6:50] commit everything into your hands now
[6:52] remember these that are sick Lord and
[6:54] for Brother Bill yonstar Lord and for
[6:56] brother Lor and for brother Ernie Lord
[6:58] and all of these and just remember
[7:00] especially today the the Canada family
[7:03] as in the loss of their loved one and we
[7:05] pray that you would just touch each one
[7:08] have your way in our hearts and lies
[7:10] today in the service forgive our sins
[7:12] lead us all in Jesus name
[7:15] amen
[7:17] Romans we just want to skip over and
[7:20] just take a little thought today and to
[7:22] uh speak something that you know we've
[7:25] been looking at and then knowing we'd
[7:27] come back to it eventually
[7:30] Romans 8:1 says there is therefore now
[7:32] no condemnation to them which are in
[7:35] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[7:37] flesh but after the spirit for the law
[7:40] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[7:42] has made me free from the law of sin and
[7:44] death for what the law could not do in
[7:47] that it was weak through the flesh God
[7:50] sending his own son in the to see the
[7:52] weakness of the law was not in the flesh
[7:55] there is no way anybody in the flesh can
[7:58] keep the law
[8:00] that's right so it's not meaning the law
[8:01] is weak the law is spiritual but we're
[8:04] carnal but see there is no way that a
[8:07] man in the flesh can keep the law so
[8:10] then all it does it just keeps
[8:12] condemning you we've been over that and
[8:13] over it uh the law just puts you in jail
[8:16] all right for that the law for what the
[8:19] law could not do in that it was weak
[8:21] through the flesh God sending his own
[8:23] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[8:25] for sin condemn sin in the flesh that
[8:28] the righteous of the law might be
[8:30] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[8:32] flesh but after the spirit for they that
[8:35] are after The Flesh do mind the things
[8:36] of the flesh but they that are after the
[8:39] spirit the things of the spirit for to
[8:42] be carnally minded is death but to be SP
[8:44] spiritually minded is life and peace
[8:47] because the carnal mind is enmity
[8:49] against God for it is not subject to the
[8:51] law of God neither indeed can be so then
[8:55] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[8:57] God but you are not in the flesh but in
[9:00] the spirit if soey that's the spirit of
[9:03] God dwell in you now if any man have not
[9:06] the spirit of Christ he is none of his
[9:09] and if Christ be in you the body is dead
[9:12] because of sin but the spirit is life
[9:16] because of righteousness but it's the
[9:18] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[9:20] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[9:22] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[9:25] your mortal bodies by his
[9:28] spirit work mortal bodies by his spirit
[9:30] that dwelleth in you therefore
[9:33] brethren we are
[9:35] debors now what not to the flesh to live
[9:40] after the
[9:42] flesh for if we live after the flesh he
[9:44] shall die but if ye through the spirit
[9:47] do mortify the Deeds of the body ye
[9:50] shall live you may be seated to the Lord
[9:52] at his Blessing to the reading of the
[9:56] word
[9:58] now I don't
[10:00] know what we will be speaking on next
[10:03] I'm not concerned I just wait for him
[10:06] and I'll take the messages as they come
[10:10] and uh you know we can speak every what
[10:14] he gives us but I just kind of concluded
[10:17] there the other day the thought that
[10:20] we've been on on marriage and divorce
[10:21] and trying to bring it to a conclusion
[10:24] and coming down to the things we were
[10:26] speaking of of the law and how that it
[10:30] was
[10:32] uh spiritual but we were
[10:35] carnal the law is right but man can't
[10:39] keep the law there's no way see the only
[10:42] person that can keep the law is a born
[10:44] again believer I hope you follow that
[10:47] see those under the law back there they
[10:49] couldn't keep it it was just a it kept
[10:52] overbearing on them so hard until there
[10:54] was no way but the born again Christian
[10:58] can keep the law but he can't keep it
[11:01] still by his flesh that's right he must
[11:04] mortify the Deeds of the flesh you know
[11:07] to be able to do that but I hope you you
[11:10] enjoyed the series I made on that and
[11:13] and all and I you know I tried to make
[11:15] the point and you'll see what I'm
[11:16] meaning in a minute because of coming to
[11:19] this scripture CU what did we cover
[11:22] first that this is a point to come up to
[11:25] here we covered that in the New Birth
[11:28] your old husband must be dead not just
[11:31] divorce not just run around with him you
[11:33] know and see him today and flirt around
[11:36] with him tomorrow and and all that old
[11:38] husband supposed to be dead the world
[11:41] because our old husband was our natural
[11:44] adamic nature that came by the Fall
[11:47] that's why we needed to be born again
[11:49] all right see then God let it die we
[11:51] went through that over and over because
[11:53] there's no way you and I can be saved
[11:56] salvation Jonah 2:9 is of the Lord Lord
[11:59] so then the only thing could be happened
[12:02] is we could just yield
[12:04] ourselves all in the world we could do
[12:06] was do as the man that was to be shot
[12:08] you know if he' had just accepted the
[12:11] pardon and walked out everything would
[12:13] be all right because that's all we can
[12:15] do we can just accept what he does
[12:17] that's right for us because it all is
[12:20] totally of him you say but I sought god
[12:22] well the Bible says no man sought God at
[12:24] any time I like the scriptures don't you
[12:27] the Bible said the goodness of God
[12:29] leadth us to
[12:31] repentance you said you ever you don't
[12:33] believe in crying and praying for the
[12:35] Lord yes that's
[12:37] fine right but that's just getting you
[12:39] out of the way I believe in fasting but
[12:42] you know what fasting is far it's just
[12:44] to get you out of the way that's all it
[12:47] is it's to it's just to get to where the
[12:49] body doesn't control right in the inward
[12:53] parts of you can come out and work
[12:54] because it's just you know but as far as
[12:57] fasting you can fast every day day life
[12:59] and still die and go to hell that
[13:01] wouldn't have anything to do with it
[13:03] whether you're born again or not and the
[13:05] only way to be born again is by the
[13:06] revealed word amen right how can they
[13:10] hear without a preacher and how can he
[13:11] preach unless he be sin all right so we
[13:13] went through that as a new birth and
[13:15] seeing that
[13:16] God you know is the one who came on the
[13:19] scene to let that old life and things
[13:23] die then we went into the marriage and
[13:25] divorce of the marital situations and
[13:27] the the grace of God to be given to the
[13:30] Bride In the End Time amen but that's
[13:32] only to the bride that can receive it
[13:34] right it is not for everybody because
[13:36] the new birth is not for everybody the
[13:39] new birth is for only those that can
[13:40] receive it all right everybody won't
[13:43] receive it that's where the trouble's
[13:44] that all right so we went through that
[13:46] to see that God let that die in his sea
[13:50] of
[13:51] forgetfulness that he could put a p our
[13:54] past apart from us
[13:57] amen yet everybody body else can
[13:59] remember
[14:01] it I I said if I ever get enough
[14:04] gumption to bring it I want to preach on
[14:05] a god with amnesia you know where he he
[14:10] he can
[14:12] forget not only that he totally forgives
[14:15] that's right and it's totally out of
[14:17] existence as far as he's concerned amen
[14:20] but we can still remember it but he
[14:22] can't remember it amen you know and they
[14:25] made a song years ago that you know that
[14:27] was about it said what sins are you
[14:28] talking about well that's true if it's
[14:31] under the blood we'll get to that in a
[14:32] minute all right but then we ended up
[14:34] with the fact of seeing that our old
[14:37] denominational husband because the
[14:40] prophet of God said it like this he said
[14:42] we're free from our sins by accepting
[14:45] Jesus Christ but he said we're still
[14:47] Bound by our Creeds and dogmas he said
[14:51] well I don't have any Creeds and dogmas
[14:54] well praise
[14:56] God pray for me right because those
[15:00] things are Creeds and dogmas are your
[15:02] ideas that are contrary to the word amen
[15:05] that's right you think you need to do
[15:07] this to do that to do this to do that to
[15:09] be saved that's a Creed and a Dogma that
[15:12] is not the word of God and I gave you
[15:14] the quote from the prophet the other day
[15:16] where he said they asked the people
[15:17] there you know what must we do to be
[15:20] saved and said we would tell them what
[15:22] to quit doing and what to go
[15:25] do he said but they didn't ask that
[15:27] question they wanted to know what to do
[15:31] but there was nothing to do except
[15:32] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and th
[15:34] sh be
[15:35] saved then your life follows after what
[15:39] your confession is right
[15:42] right see that that's why we're against
[15:45] the world and the things because you go
[15:47] out and see people living like the world
[15:49] doing like the world dressing like the
[15:51] world but yet claim to be
[15:55] Christians well that doesn't fit too
[15:57] good in the in the category but I hope
[15:59] you understand what I'm saying see that
[16:02] old husband the Bible tells us we must
[16:05] be Washed by the Water of the word all
[16:09] right or washing by the water of the
[16:12] word if you want to be
[16:13] technical all right now in doing that
[16:18] what did we find the only way that old
[16:20] husband could die of organized religion
[16:23] is for God to reveal the word to
[16:25] us all right we read our last the other
[16:27] day where what that the prophet of God
[16:29] said on Feast of the trumpets that the
[16:32] Holy Ghost had been bound for 2,000
[16:34] years at the door of Creeds and dogas
[16:37] but would be loosed by the end time
[16:40] message it didn't say it would be loosed
[16:42] by the end time messenger no right all
[16:47] right but the bride must become one with
[16:49] the
[16:50] message which is the revealed word and
[16:53] by becoming one with the message then
[16:55] our old husband will die that's right
[16:58] and get R of him sure we still have
[17:00] trouble he tries to come back
[17:03] up but we keep pushing him down so
[17:06] that's what we want to talk about now
[17:08] here in our scripture today because we
[17:10] want to look at it in the correct
[17:14] way to
[17:17] understand so we read it says there is
[17:20] therefore now no
[17:22] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[17:25] Jesus amen all right
[17:29] right
[17:31] now see taking it to try to see the
[17:34] revealed
[17:36] word is what is the New Birth the
[17:39] revealed word is what tells you the
[17:41] truth of marriage and divorce the
[17:43] revealed word is letting our old
[17:45] denominational husband die our
[17:48] understanding our beliefs our thoughts
[17:50] right yeah but I I'm out of organized
[17:52] religion that's good did you but has God
[17:54] got that out of you you know
[17:59] see what what's the difference in moving
[18:01] coats and hats you know what I mean one
[18:03] place to another amen if you don't
[18:06] intend to go on with God what they need
[18:07] a moveing that's right amen why don't we
[18:10] just go down and get us some crackers
[18:12] and start Wafers and start being
[18:14] Catholic if we don't intend to go on we
[18:17] just go back to them and sit down and
[18:20] wait all right not sarcastic just being
[18:24] truthful I'm speaking of where we should
[18:26] be and what we should be doing and doing
[18:29] it but now see we look at the
[18:33] scriptures and we'll read that part and
[18:35] we say I'm a born again
[18:40] Christian so there's no
[18:42] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[18:45] Jesus then we like to read the psalmist
[18:49] where he says you know Paul in Romans
[18:52] but quoting back
[18:54] from and it actually is not in the
[18:56] Psalms and the and that David didn't say
[18:59] the blessed is a man to whom God will
[19:01] not impute sin like we think we'll get
[19:04] to that if we have time but it Paul when
[19:07] Paul read it he said what was being said
[19:10] all right now
[19:13] but does it give us a license to steal
[19:17] to be wrong or what because we're a
[19:21] Christian you know is it okay to just
[19:24] live any life you want to as taught by
[19:27] organized religion and
[19:30] and don't organize religions in this
[19:33] message that are worse than the ones
[19:35] that are out dire right I mean is it all
[19:38] right is it okay for us to do it because
[19:40] we say well I believe in Jesus
[19:42] Christ you
[19:44] know I mean we are we so blind until we
[19:47] can't
[19:49] see the
[19:51] truth and then you know is it that we
[19:55] believe well you know
[19:58] the Bible says I'll get to it in a
[20:00] minute if our heart condemn us
[20:04] not but we leave off the next few
[20:08] words because it goes on to say that God
[20:10] is greater than our heart am why would
[20:13] it say that
[20:16] right we say yeah but I just won't let
[20:18] my heart condemn
[20:21] me I'll accuse that of being the devil
[20:24] amen you know I I'll say the devil's one
[20:27] trying to Dem me well I don't have much
[20:31] problems I don't know about you but I
[20:34] don't have much
[20:36] problems with the point of whether or
[20:38] not I'm
[20:40] guilty do you I mean I I can
[20:45] remember and I can you know realize my
[20:49] state I'm
[20:52] in but yet see we can say well I just
[20:55] won't let my heart condemn me
[21:02] I I'll say that's the devil condemning
[21:05] me I ain't going back to that church no
[21:07] more cuz they preached about
[21:11] me well did they tell the
[21:14] truth I mean no
[21:20] problem Oh Brother
[21:23] uh years ago he was sitting on the
[21:25] platform this willing back and I won't
[21:28] call his name but he had on two tone
[21:31] shoes you
[21:32] know well that back in the days of
[21:35] coming through Pentecost and things and
[21:38] the preacher was Raising Cane about
[21:39] things and he looked around and then the
[21:41] boy jumped on them two-tone shoes well
[21:44] the brother I guess he was trying to you
[21:46] know get his shoes up under him or do
[21:48] something but it was two-tone shoes you
[21:51] know that's what he's beaten on
[21:54] well but you know what the man did have
[21:56] on two-tone shoes
[21:58] yeah I
[22:01] mean and I've told my people about years
[22:03] ago we used to talk about what to do and
[22:06] and everything when certain brothers
[22:08] would come around you know we we were
[22:10] told to not wear certain clothes cuz
[22:13] they going to preach on it you know I
[22:16] mean that's no joke that's going back
[22:19] but knowing the preacher preach on it
[22:22] not meaning ungodly clothes I'm talking
[22:24] about just certain ones and this one old
[22:27] brother he
[22:28] he used to come around and he used to
[22:29] preach about a entt dress well I'm just
[22:33] so carnal I don't know anything anyway
[22:36] and I didn't know what a entt dress
[22:39] was so you know we'd heard so many
[22:41] sermons about it I went to my wife and I
[22:44] said honey what is a entt
[22:47] dress and the way she described it you
[22:50] know was where that it kind of goes out
[22:54] but then it was kind of tucked in some
[22:55] way up here you know not all together
[22:58] than knowing even yet what it is but
[23:00] some way it was done like that was kind
[23:01] of tucked in and and hung out a lot and
[23:04] it's called a tent dress and I said well
[23:07] I still don't know what a ENT dress is I
[23:09] said would you mind pointing out one you
[23:12] know because I I I don't go around see
[23:16] my wife will say what did Brother so and
[23:18] so have on
[23:21] today
[23:26] cloth
[23:29] you see I I wanted to know what a tent
[23:31] dress was I said Point some out honey
[23:33] and she said well that's them sisters
[23:36] right over there well you know where
[23:38] them sisters right over there was they
[23:41] come from from where the brother was the
[23:43] pastor they were talking about the tent
[23:45] dressing I said what don't he pick on
[23:47] these
[23:48] people said they're picking on everybody
[23:50] you
[23:51] know but we come or should be able to
[23:55] come through those things but still my
[23:58] point
[24:00] is if our
[24:03] heart condemn us
[24:08] not well I just won't let it condemn
[24:14] me but see the rest of the scriptures
[24:17] you need to read all of it he said God
[24:19] knows the heart right you know you're
[24:22] not pulling nothing over on anybody but
[24:24] your own self that's right you know
[24:27] people look got you in life and you're
[24:28] trying to convince them or something you
[24:30] ever noticed that you ever notice people
[24:32] trying to convince you of
[24:35] something it's okay to do this okay to
[24:38] do that isn't
[24:40] it they're trying to convince you of
[24:43] what they
[24:44] think all right but you see God knows
[24:49] the heart all right now a simple I mean
[24:53] maybe an odd way of approaching
[24:56] things
[24:59] but there is no condemnation the
[25:01] scripture
[25:02] says to those that are in Christ
[25:06] Jesus but now Paul never stopped there
[25:12] right he continued by
[25:16] saying who walk not after the
[25:19] flesh but after the
[25:23] spirit
[25:24] right now he didn't leave it as a
[25:30] loophole and well Paul
[25:34] said see we can quote
[25:38] Romans and we can say blessed is a man
[25:40] to whom God will not impute
[25:46] sin
[25:48] well I can just do anything I want to
[25:53] then well go
[25:55] ahead I think you ought to do what you
[25:57] want to that's right I
[26:03] do I mean I try to do what I want
[26:06] to don't
[26:08] you I thought a Christian was supposed
[26:11] to be in that category
[26:13] to let it be Christ Living in
[26:18] us so there's no condemnation to them
[26:21] that are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[26:24] after the flesh that's
[26:26] right if we walk after the
[26:32] flesh the holy spirit will automatically
[26:35] condemn
[26:37] us true right I mean somebody have to
[26:41] come along tell you that's
[26:46] wrong if it is you have seared your
[26:49] conscience that's right you have got to
[26:52] word that you're not listening to what
[26:53] anything can tell you
[26:56] amen right well it don't bother me to
[27:00] wear these clothes
[27:02] well you
[27:05] know maybe you need to get born
[27:08] again might change
[27:11] things and Heaven help you if you dress
[27:14] here one way and dress another way out
[27:17] in the world Amen you
[27:22] know now that would be a hypocrite
[27:25] that's right that's the best way to say
[27:26] it
[27:28] that's why I've always said to a lot of
[27:30] times the people here don't go out and
[27:32] tell people where you go to church if
[27:34] you're going to dress outd like you do
[27:38] here you know in act don't don't don't
[27:40] tell them where you go oh that's a lamb
[27:43] basting on me you
[27:47] know that's where people don't
[27:49] understand me they say but brother Dale
[27:51] brother so and so preached a message one
[27:53] day on there is therefore now no
[27:55] condemnation them that are in Christ
[27:57] Jesus and and I felt so wonderful and so
[28:01] sweet and I just had no
[28:05] guilt
[28:10] yeah I I wish I could preach that
[28:13] away but you know I found out a long
[28:18] time ago like I said about the
[28:21] scripture where he said if our heart
[28:23] condemn us not I found out to keep
[28:26] reading
[28:28] it says for God is greater than my
[28:32] heart and you know what according to 1
[28:36] Corinthians
[28:41] 11 which is the communion scriptures
[28:43] that I
[28:47] love the Bible says there if we judge
[28:49] ourselves will not be
[28:55] judged so we don't judge ourselves else
[28:57] you know what we're going to do we're
[28:59] going to be
[29:01] judged there's no such thing as a
[29:03] Christian now being judged of whether or
[29:05] not they're going to heaven now forget
[29:07] that now cuz there's two judgments in
[29:09] the Bible one of them is a white Throne
[29:11] judgment which means the people stand
[29:14] there will be judged whether or not they
[29:15] receive eternal life the other one is
[29:18] the Judgment of the Deeds that we do in
[29:20] the
[29:21] body that we're going to have to give an
[29:23] account for if we don't repent amen
[29:26] right I'm a firm believer in one thing
[29:29] getting things
[29:30] straight while we're here
[29:35] amen oh all I want to do just get
[29:38] there
[29:40] well you're more you're bordering on the
[29:43] basis that you don't give a
[29:45] hoot right about
[29:47] salvation right why wouldn't you want to
[29:50] live
[29:51] right why wouldn't a Christian want to
[29:53] do right and live
[29:55] right when you're a living example
[29:58] before your families your friends your
[30:01] loved
[30:04] ones why wouldn't you want to live
[30:09] right well I stand before my God the
[30:13] Bible says if a man looks on a woman to
[30:16] lust
[30:17] after he's committed adultery with her
[30:21] in his heart
[30:23] right and an explanation comes from the
[30:26] prophet like what
[30:29] you present yourself wrong and they do
[30:32] that you're
[30:34] guilty a woman can't help being a woman
[30:38] right I mean we're not old
[30:42] timey but you can't help being what you
[30:44] are you can't help being built the way
[30:47] you
[30:49] are but you can
[30:53] help you know from being the point of
[30:56] trying to make people lust after
[31:01] that you know what you're doing when you
[31:03] put on tight
[31:06] clothes
[31:08] right you know what you're doing you're
[31:10] trying to show your form you're trying
[31:11] to live in a byone days of 16 year
[31:14] old you
[31:16] know
[31:22] right hey I get up look in a mirror too
[31:25] just like you do
[31:32] like I've always said there's been more
[31:33] muscles torn by
[31:37] weightlifters in front of mirrors than
[31:39] they have on a bench
[31:41] press CU you get in front of the mirror
[31:47] it I wish I had brother forny I could
[31:50] really do a good
[31:52] job and you know I do I get up a morning
[31:55] I look in the mirror I looked pretty
[31:58] good then I turn to walk out and that
[31:59] old belly
[32:02] go as long as I can walk
[32:05] straight all the
[32:07] time I wouldn't look too
[32:10] bad come
[32:12] on do a little comical to make you think
[32:16] though but you see we say that would my
[32:20] heart don't condemn
[32:23] me the prophet say like this he said you
[32:27] got no more conscious than the snakes
[32:28] got
[32:29] hips well that's pretty good point is
[32:34] it but you see it doesn't leave the
[32:37] Bible that's what I love about it it
[32:40] doesn't leave
[32:44] loopholes you show me loopholes in the
[32:49] Bible it's not
[32:53] there if our heart condemn us
[32:56] not
[32:57] well I just won't let it condemn me and
[32:59] God said but God is greater than your
[33:02] heart in other words you'll
[33:04] automatically know you're doing
[33:06] wrong or
[33:13] should then we read that there's no
[33:15] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[33:22] Jesus but we fail to
[33:25] read to those who walk walk not after
[33:27] the flesh right but after the
[33:32] spirit Paul then goes on to say we walk
[33:34] after the flesh we are ruled by the
[33:37] flesh that's right but if we walk after
[33:40] the
[33:43] spirit then we're ruled by the Holy
[33:45] Spirit that's
[33:48] right then is it saying about
[33:53] David that Romans would say and Paul
[33:56] saying that
[33:57] blessed is a man to whom God will not
[33:59] impute
[34:00] sin was it David was a certain kind of a
[34:04] person that uh so you
[34:09] know God loved him so
[34:12] much it didn't matter what David
[34:20] done I will remind
[34:23] you as I said the Bible doesn't have
[34:25] loophole that we can follow into or C
[34:27] try to crawl
[34:29] into the same Bible that speaks of David
[34:32] it blessed is a man to whom God will not
[34:34] impute
[34:35] sin the same Bible said
[34:39] David you will not build me a
[34:45] house am I
[34:47] right that Solomon will build a
[34:51] house because there's too many problems
[34:53] in David's
[34:55] life for David to do
[35:02] it the same God that we talk about
[35:04] blessed Is He To whom God will not
[35:06] impute
[35:08] sin the same God took a child that was
[35:11] born out of wedlock from
[35:14] David and took the life of the
[35:18] child you see there's not any loopholes
[35:20] in the Bible to try to crawl into or
[35:23] find something you
[35:25] know
[35:27] it's
[35:29] straight so then we should never have
[35:31] the idea or
[35:33] thought well I won't let my heart
[35:35] condemn
[35:39] me I'll just believe what I
[35:47] believe and then I'll turn around and
[35:49] justify Myself by saying well you know I
[35:51] don't live much worse than that other
[35:54] person so if they going to make it yeah
[35:57] maybe I
[36:00] can
[36:03] right the Bible says always judging
[36:06] ourselves comparing ourselves with one
[36:11] another and never gets us
[36:17] anywhere it
[36:20] right what was the difference in
[36:25] David and anybody
[36:28] else I've preached to you before all of
[36:30] these things
[36:32] right what was the great thing about
[36:34] Abraham that God would choose
[36:39] him was he a special
[36:42] guy
[36:46] you and why would it speak of David to
[36:49] say he's a man after my own
[36:55] heart
[36:59] was it something special of course now
[37:02] we get into the message of the hour of
[37:04] the people of the message of the hour
[37:06] and they make David some great big
[37:09] seed right seed s e e d
[37:17] seed and then they'll say well now wait
[37:19] a minute then that blessed is the man to
[37:21] whom God will not impute sin is that
[37:25] seed
[37:27] what is the seed of
[37:32] God we say well the seed of God's his
[37:34] word that's right amen well did David
[37:37] have something
[37:41] special no he had a lot of
[37:46] flaws but the one thing David had that
[37:48] God loved was an honest and a contrite
[37:52] heart
[37:55] right
[37:57] the one thing about Abraham was what not
[38:00] a special guy or some seed
[38:05] relationship but he believed
[38:09] God how many people in the days that
[38:11] have always Illustrated of
[38:15] Abraham did God speak
[38:17] to maybe a lot of
[38:21] them but none of them wouldn't do what
[38:24] Abraham
[38:25] done and God knew that by his forn
[38:28] knowledge so what is the seed of God
[38:30] that we talk about all of this message
[38:33] people seed seed
[38:37] seed I thought we believed in God by his
[38:40] for knowledge knew what we would do and
[38:42] wouldn't
[38:43] do I thought that was the Simplicity of
[38:47] it was God's forn knowledge allowed him
[38:50] to be able to look down and see that
[38:54] Jacob would cherish the birth right do
[38:56] everything he could get conniving
[38:59] stealing to get the bird
[39:03] right and that Esau would just so what I
[39:08] care about the birth R I'm
[39:18] hungry see did God for orain all of this
[39:22] to
[39:25] be or is it that he know it would
[39:30] be which one is it I have no problem
[39:33] with
[39:33] predestination for
[39:36] knowledge
[39:39] right come in here with a seed in you I
[39:41] have no problem with that that's the
[39:43] words the prophet said I have problems
[39:47] with our
[39:49] interpretation amen upon those things
[39:55] right
[39:58] see then you find the people a lot of
[40:00] times that are preaching those
[40:06] doctrines um their lives are not too
[40:12] good then they go off into polygam and
[40:15] everything in the
[40:20] world cuz why because if you ever get to
[40:23] the bases you think well it don't
[40:25] condemn me to do wrong
[40:29] you know that that is
[40:32] Catholicism you know that in
[40:34] Catholicism you are allowed the fact of
[40:38] paying a Penance price to forgive your
[40:42] sins before you do
[40:48] them that's
[40:51] Catholicism to pay for the pay to be
[40:54] forgiven before you even do it
[40:59] I'm I'm sorry I'm I'm a little bit dumb
[41:00] I guess I don't mind admitting that
[41:03] stupid got a different point on that
[41:07] but I just can't believe stuff like
[41:13] that you
[41:15] know and mean you come up and you tell
[41:17] me say well brother Dale it's okay let's
[41:18] just all go get drunk and grows do
[41:21] everything want to go we're born again
[41:23] we're going to heaven
[41:25] anyway
[41:27] I'm too old I'm sorry maybe that but you
[41:30] know I didn't believe that when I was 20
[41:31] years
[41:33] old I didn't believe that for coming to
[41:38] message I told you about them coming to
[41:40] me trying to get me to come to church
[41:42] when I
[41:44] was young kid you know a boy I told him
[41:48] I said well I live a better life than
[41:51] your Deacon
[41:53] board and they didn't want to argue with
[41:55] me about it
[41:59] see I mean it then I mean it
[42:02] now there's no loopholes in the Bible
[42:04] there's no places to try to slide
[42:09] through the best thing to me as I see is
[42:13] stand up and face God straight
[42:17] ahead and take what he
[42:24] says you have many in instances in the
[42:29] Bible now if I get them wrong making the
[42:32] ones but you know sometimes it would
[42:34] offer to the children of
[42:37] Israel you can do
[42:39] this you can do
[42:42] this you remember that in the Old
[42:44] Testament you can you can fight the
[42:47] enemy you can do this you can do things
[42:50] or said you can be in the hand of
[42:55] God
[42:57] immediately they chose the correct thing
[42:59] and they
[43:00] said we'll be in the hand of
[43:03] God you remember that in the scripture
[43:05] get back in the Old Testament and read a
[43:08] little because see I'd rather be in the
[43:10] hand of God than be in the hand of my
[43:13] enemy yeah but God's going to he's going
[43:16] to do this he's going to do that but
[43:17] what's your enemy going to
[43:22] do see my whole point I wish I could
[43:25] change it to a a great thing I've got a
[43:28] title no condemnation I wish I could
[43:30] come out and preach you know so
[43:32] beautiful a sermon that that everybody
[43:35] hear it say I don't feel
[43:38] condemned and the only way you can ever
[43:40] come to that is the
[43:42] truth to be made known to
[43:50] you I don't believe in once saved always
[43:53] saved no didn't believe that in the
[43:55] Baptist
[43:58] I believe truly born again you are born
[44:01] again that's right and that you will not
[44:05] want to
[44:06] do the things of the world that's right
[44:10] I didn't say you wouldn't do things
[44:11] wrong that's right I didn't say
[44:18] that see I
[44:21] believe in
[44:24] God he has so made a way for you and I
[44:28] to take care of our problems that's
[44:32] right the first thing is to repent
[44:36] amen right yes and David an honest and a
[44:41] contrite
[44:45] heart David was quick and we life about
[44:48] it but he was quick to give an honest
[44:51] judgment
[44:52] yes when the prophet said this man had
[44:56] these sheep this man his neighbor had
[44:59] one he went over and took the
[45:01] one David was quick to give his
[45:06] judgment kill the man bring him here he
[45:10] said
[45:11] David th art the
[45:15] man changed the whole scene didn't
[45:20] it but did David start running around
[45:23] well okay but I'm I'm I'm just telling
[45:26] you I didn't do
[45:27] that he surely wouldn't have told the
[45:29] prophet that would he that's
[45:32] right you've heard all these lies about
[45:34] me now
[45:36] Prophet no he didn't do
[45:39] that he fell on his face before the
[45:42] prophet and began to cry
[45:45] out the prophet said but
[45:48] David you won't
[45:51] die why he said because I prayed for you
[45:55] y
[45:58] and we talk about the grace of marriage
[45:59] and divorce and the grace of Salvation
[46:03] the there's a lot of Grace in The Bible
[46:06] yes it
[46:08] amen you realize it didn't matter where
[46:11] he was king or what he was he was to
[46:13] have been killed for what he
[46:18] done it wasn't because he was King that
[46:20] he was
[46:23] fired many kings died
[46:30] but it was because the
[46:32] prophet received the Revelation from God
[46:35] and prayed for the
[46:37] man and went down and said you won't die
[46:41] because I have prayed for you amen
[46:47] right you realize what he was
[46:53] doing was it Nathan
[46:56] Nathan had interceded with God Amen for
[46:59] David
[47:01] amen Nathan knew the laws the strictness
[47:04] of God the condemnation and he knew
[47:07] David was dead and he knew that probably
[47:10] he would be the
[47:12] one to have to kill him right cuz nobody
[47:16] else wouldn't have tried it David was
[47:20] King but a prophet couldn't fear
[47:24] nothing
[47:28] you know I love it to look at the word
[47:29] and see those things I know you see
[47:31] things from movies but yet still truth
[47:34] is truth you read your Bible
[47:37] that
[47:39] when the prophet went before
[47:45] Saul all Saul had to do or David had to
[47:47] do is just go whack your old boy's head
[47:51] off
[47:53] right you never even thought about
[47:56] Moses going down to Egypt before the
[48:01] Pharaoh why didn't the Pharaoh said hey
[48:04] cut his
[48:06] throat shut him up he's afraid of
[48:12] him see those kings Saul even inquired
[48:17] and said what has God told
[48:22] you he said God has told me your kingdom
[48:25] will be rent from
[48:30] you so reads your Bible didn't rent and
[48:33] RAV and scream and holler he humbly
[48:36] bowed himself to the prophet to accept
[48:39] what had been done because he knew from
[48:42] his heart that he was
[48:43] guilty that's what I mean by when I
[48:45] started off with
[48:47] it if our heart condemn us
[48:52] not see Saul
[48:54] knew the God was
[48:58] right David knew that God was
[49:05] right being a Christian don't give you a
[49:07] license to steal as we call
[49:11] it like brother Mo used to make a little
[49:13] comment about it you know you say well
[49:16] the Bible says Thou shalt not steal he
[49:17] said but it don't say not steal
[49:21] chickens ain't no scripture says don't
[49:23] steal chickens
[49:31] but are you listening to what I'm
[49:32] talking about are we trying to find
[49:35] loopholes to be able to slide
[49:40] through instead of taking it standing up
[49:42] face
[49:44] value I know I offended some of
[49:47] you what I spoke on marriage and divorce
[49:50] and I've always spoke because you know
[49:52] it and I said some people would not be
[49:56] able to get their marital situation
[50:00] straight and thereby you would have to
[50:03] die and go by the
[50:07] grave I know that's
[50:10] offensive but it's a truth
[50:15] amen if I had a marital situation I
[50:18] would stand before the church and say
[50:21] I'm
[50:22] guilty and I'm not trying to find a
[50:24] loophole
[50:27] but pray that God will speak to me and
[50:29] have a
[50:31] Grace and I wouldn't blame you for it
[50:33] being brought
[50:41] up come
[50:44] on a great man one
[50:48] day rle with an angel all
[50:53] night the next day he wouldn't let let
[50:55] him go
[50:57] right he said I won't let you go until
[50:59] you bless me that's right but what was
[51:01] the blessing he
[51:03] got a
[51:05] limp
[51:08] y
[51:09] right
[51:11] right didn't the man ever complain about
[51:14] the
[51:15] limp is any record he ever gried about
[51:21] it right he knew that that limp was a
[51:27] blessing
[51:29] right
[51:32] right I remember preaching a message
[51:35] many many years ago how many of you
[51:36] remember the bless the blessings of a
[51:45] blemish a blessings of a
[51:51] blemish you got a whole field full of
[51:53] sheep yeah and you go out there and you
[51:56] look around you're looking for one to
[51:59] make a
[52:00] sacrifice
[52:04] right and you look down and you look at
[52:06] them and you say
[52:08] well this one has a
[52:10] blemish you can't use it this one has a
[52:13] blemish you can't use
[52:17] it they got to
[52:19] live because of their blemish that's
[52:23] right
[52:24] right the blessings of a
[52:29] blemish but see the main thought I had
[52:31] then and the main one I have now
[52:33] is there is a way to get rid of a
[52:36] blemish right right instead of making a
[52:40] blemish a
[52:49] curse he got a name change to Israel
[52:53] that went with his blemish
[52:56] right the chosen of
[53:01] God David you're not going to
[53:05] die you got a
[53:08] blemish but I've prayed for you to try
[53:10] to cover your
[53:12] blemish that was the only way it could
[53:14] be covered if you understand what I mean
[53:16] it didn't matter if you were king or
[53:18] what you done in God's word death to do
[53:21] these
[53:24] things
[53:29] he said you won't die but you got to
[53:31] blemish the rest of your
[53:35] life and you will not be able to build
[53:37] me a
[53:40] house can you see
[53:43] David God let me build my house oh I'm
[53:47] so
[53:52] pitiful I'm talking about me and you
[53:55] amen
[53:57] right we say yeah I know I've done wrong
[54:00] in my life but there's no need of people
[54:02] keep bringing it
[54:06] up you done it
[54:09] right why you stand up with enough gut
[54:12] sometimes to just say hey I've done
[54:13] these things I'm guilty and God forgive
[54:16] me you know that way God can forgive you
[54:18] that's I'll clap to that in
[54:22] myself that way God can forgive you
[54:31] right you said well brother D you
[54:33] telling me I can't make the
[54:36] change I didn't say you couldn't go to
[54:45] heaven you
[54:47] see no loopholes in the
[54:50] Bible or to change the title I guess to
[54:52] that no loopholes
[54:57] those that amounted anything in the
[54:59] Bible had many flaws
[55:02] yes but yet they believed in a savior
[55:06] amen they believed in an atonement
[55:10] yes was job arguing with those three
[55:14] that he was so
[55:17] perfect have you read the book of job
[55:19] lately did he argue with him I haven't
[55:22] done what you said I've done you don't
[55:25] find job doing that job said I made the
[55:29] atonement that God said for me to
[55:33] make and said I made it not only for me
[55:36] I made it for my
[55:38] family you know and God honored that
[55:41] atonement why do you think a Christian
[55:43] needs an
[55:46] advocate is that the Bible the Bible
[55:50] said we have an
[55:51] advocate with the father Jesus J Christ
[55:55] the
[55:56] righteous what do you need an advocate
[55:58] for if you're not
[55:59] guilty that's
[56:05] right see then it was Romans Paul
[56:08] talking about what David was saying in
[56:11] the
[56:12] Psalms and bringing it down to blessed
[56:15] is a man to whom God will not impute
[56:21] sin David was looking at back there and
[56:25] I mean Paul was looking back there and
[56:27] seeing that God never made a record
[56:30] because right David
[56:38] repented David repented for what he
[56:41] done he didn't run around and try to
[56:44] justify it you don't understand it's her
[56:52] fault I just followed the L to the flesh
[56:55] it's her
[56:57] fault he said yeah and you had 500 lust
[56:59] if you wanted it at
[57:04] home
[57:10] right do you understand what I'm trying
[57:13] to get at folks
[57:15] right do we use the Bible and the things
[57:18] to try to justify our our ways of doing
[57:21] or do we look at it straight and say God
[57:24] forgive me right which one is
[57:30] it you can only prop up so
[57:35] long you
[57:36] know cuz somebody's going to come by and
[57:39] expose you
[57:41] right you can say so long I'm not
[57:45] guilty but you know what I love about
[57:48] it I love it when God says I'm not
[57:52] guilty right then I don't care what
[57:55] anybody else says about how guilty I am
[57:57] right sister Gil it's when he says I'm
[57:59] not
[58:04] guilty David's sin was imputed to
[58:09] him but not the fact of losing his
[58:15] soul our sins are recorded unto us
[58:18] unless we
[58:23] repent
[58:28] we had a sister here played the piano
[58:29] with us for years and this is what we
[58:31] were T we were preaching about and she
[58:33] said I got to the place I wondered who
[58:35] do I repent to she said then if I'm who
[58:37] you say I am that I'm God in flesh I
[58:40] have nobody to repent to I said there's
[58:42] where you messed up that's
[58:46] right cuz that was what not that was not
[58:48] what was being
[58:52] taught when I'm talking about that
[58:54] you're God in flesh I'm talking about in
[58:57] that Soul by the new
[59:00] birth is the only Godly partner is to
[59:03] any of us right
[59:06] amen there is nothing in these flesh and
[59:09] spirit Realms of you and I that are
[59:10] worth
[59:14] anything oh but I remember so so done
[59:17] this look what they done look what he
[59:18] trying to do go back to
[59:23] works
[59:25] why not look straight into God's face
[59:27] and say I'm
[59:32] sorry because remember how I preach
[59:36] it some of you could take the thought
[59:38] right now and continue it right
[59:41] what brother collie does something to
[59:49] me I I do something to
[59:53] him you know I need to get rid of it the
[59:56] Bible says immediately said Don't Let
[59:57] the Sun Go Down on your wrath right amen
[1:00:01] right CU if not what am I going to do
[1:00:03] the next day well you know I'm not I'm
[1:00:06] not quite as guilty as I thought I was
[1:00:08] you know about two days later you know
[1:00:10] he's guilty and I'm not I've come out of
[1:00:13] beautiful you it was his
[1:00:23] fault it wasn't my fault cuz I run into
[1:00:26] the back of that
[1:00:28] car the car ought not have been there
[1:00:31] that's
[1:00:34] right
[1:00:37] right see we wind up justifying
[1:00:40] ourselves condemning everything around
[1:00:42] us that's not what's in the Bible
[1:00:48] amen if our heart condemn us
[1:00:52] not we have
[1:00:55] confidence with God yes
[1:00:58] right how is it that it can be that my
[1:01:00] heart won't condemn me when I'm not
[1:01:05] guilty right
[1:01:08] right you don't bother me it wouldn't
[1:01:11] bother me for you to put my name in the
[1:01:14] in the
[1:01:15] newspaper Wall Street Journal or
[1:01:17] whatever you want to put it and say that
[1:01:19] I robbed a bank that's right say
[1:01:23] well I ain't
[1:01:29] guilty but you know what the problem is
[1:01:31] is when I'm guilty you put my name in
[1:01:34] there you would not have put my name in
[1:01:37] there you could have made at least
[1:01:40] Samuel
[1:01:44] sobody
[1:01:46] right and we've trying to find loopholes
[1:01:49] to get out of something instead of
[1:01:50] repenting that's right
[1:01:53] amen
[1:01:58] it's very easy to say I'm
[1:02:01] sorry right cheap
[1:02:04] words all right but now listen to this
[1:02:07] it's hard to say I'm sorry when I mean
[1:02:09] it that's
[1:02:12] right now wait a minute you're shaking
[1:02:14] your head don't don't don't
[1:02:15] misunderstand what I'm
[1:02:17] saying I said it the way I wanted
[1:02:21] to for me to say I'm sorry it's cheap
[1:02:24] word words that's right 15 c words
[1:02:27] that's
[1:02:28] right but me to say I'm sorry when I
[1:02:31] know I'm
[1:02:35] guilty it's hard to
[1:02:38] do
[1:02:42] right I want you to be guilty
[1:02:46] too and then we're all guilty together
[1:02:48] and who's going to condemn
[1:02:52] who you see what I'm talking
[1:02:55] yes David didn't try to find a loophole
[1:02:59] well was her
[1:03:04] fault Saul didn't say now you know
[1:03:07] Lord we needed some
[1:03:11] sheep you remember the prophet when he
[1:03:13] told him he said wi's a blat to the
[1:03:15] Sheep when he said he done took care of
[1:03:16] everything oh you now Lord you know we
[1:03:19] needed some sheep to
[1:03:22] eat that kind of that doesn't work with
[1:03:25] human being let alone
[1:03:28] God but an honest and a contrite
[1:03:34] heart which is the
[1:03:39] greatest the one who simply says I'm
[1:03:41] sorry or the one who means I'm
[1:03:46] sorry see then there it comes to a place
[1:03:50] somewhere in God through the reveal word
[1:03:52] that we realize it hey wait a minute
[1:03:59] this thing don't give me a license to
[1:04:03] steal but it does show me that I'm not
[1:04:06] going to
[1:04:08] hell I'm beginning to
[1:04:13] realize as David that that somebody's
[1:04:16] taking my place or doing
[1:04:18] something I'm beginning to realize that
[1:04:20] hey wait a
[1:04:23] minute I've done that I know I've done
[1:04:25] it I'm
[1:04:27] guilty but yet God says he don't
[1:04:30] remember
[1:04:34] it you see what I meant all of that time
[1:04:37] of trying to preach about God let it
[1:04:40] die cuz that old husband can only be
[1:04:42] dead if God lets it die not you trying
[1:04:45] to kill it
[1:04:47] right you can try all you want to you
[1:04:50] won't kill it that's
[1:04:51] right you won't kill that old damic
[1:04:54] nature that's right it'll keep coming up
[1:04:58] that's right you won't kill that marital
[1:05:00] situation it'll keep coming up right you
[1:05:04] won't kill that old organized religious
[1:05:07] system that's trying to rule us it'll
[1:05:09] keep coming up that's
[1:05:13] right so I'm dependent upon God letting
[1:05:16] it
[1:05:20] die I said is the Bible said if we judge
[1:05:23] ourselves we'll not be
[1:05:25] judged but that ain't all of
[1:05:28] it
[1:05:30] right that ain't all that scripture
[1:05:32] right what's the rest of it but if we
[1:05:36] are
[1:05:40] judged
[1:05:43] amen thank God for
[1:05:45] judgment amen if we are judged we'll get
[1:05:49] rid of
[1:05:51] it you can hide all you want to to
[1:05:54] whatever doing but you're not going to
[1:05:55] hide it from God cuz he's greater than
[1:05:57] the
[1:05:58] heart
[1:06:01] right you can pretend to be right all
[1:06:04] you want to and it won't work that's
[1:06:05] right right but if we judge
[1:06:09] ourselves he's righteous and will not
[1:06:11] condemn us with the
[1:06:14] world there's the truth of there is
[1:06:17] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:06:19] that are in Christ
[1:06:22] Jesus why because are not going to walk
[1:06:25] after the flesh sure we have trouble
[1:06:28] with the flesh we live in the flesh
[1:06:34] Amen brother brandham said what they
[1:06:38] said brother Rand do you sin he said
[1:06:39] every
[1:06:43] day he didn't try to be no holy P
[1:06:47] self-righteous
[1:06:51] hypocrite I never will forget the time
[1:06:54] time that he was talking that man was
[1:06:55] was rashing him lambasting him about his
[1:06:57] doctor or something he said him mother's
[1:07:00] want he said I wanted it
[1:07:02] myself I just look at him I not meaning
[1:07:05] that he didn't mad and mean and hateful
[1:07:07] he just said I want that old
[1:07:11] boy I'm going to handle
[1:07:13] this he's
[1:07:16] human
[1:07:18] right he was a human being
[1:07:22] exactly
[1:07:25] but he was real quick to say I'm
[1:07:31] sorry when one time they come you know
[1:07:33] about to tax case and was trying to
[1:07:35] aggravate him so much and
[1:07:38] all he told his wife and they called him
[1:07:40] on the phone the phone rang she said
[1:07:42] it's them lawyers and things he said
[1:07:45] tell them I'm not in
[1:07:47] here and he walked out the door you know
[1:07:51] he was right he wasn't in
[1:07:52] there
[1:07:54] right right he went out the door he
[1:07:58] wasn't in
[1:08:00] there
[1:08:03] right he wife said somebody said well
[1:08:06] honey I wasn't in
[1:08:08] there he said
[1:08:10] Bill and why it got a way of getting at
[1:08:13] you you know I mean you can say all you
[1:08:15] want to but a while they'll say
[1:08:22] sam
[1:08:24] but he went out to pray for a little
[1:08:28] child we don't finish that
[1:08:32] story he goes out to pray for a little
[1:08:34] child and he starts to lay his hands on
[1:08:37] him Holy Spirit speaks and said take
[1:08:40] your dirty hands
[1:08:45] off now he hadn't
[1:08:48] lied right he wasn't in the
[1:08:52] house but he was deceiving with
[1:08:56] it because is there when the phone rang
[1:08:59] and who it was on the phone that's
[1:09:02] right holy spirit said take your dirty
[1:09:05] hands
[1:09:06] off he went and called that lawyer and
[1:09:08] said listen I was in the house and I'm
[1:09:13] sorry and even the lawyer said I got
[1:09:15] more confidence in you now than ever had
[1:09:17] would you be honest
[1:09:19] enough but then he went back over there
[1:09:21] and he said bring me that child
[1:09:24] yes and God healed a child right
[1:09:29] there we think well it don't matter what
[1:09:31] I do it's just little simple
[1:09:35] stuff you remember the Bible
[1:09:38] says the little
[1:09:40] foxes is what spoils the
[1:09:44] Vine I didn't even know brother ROM knew
[1:09:46] what we call those old things but L you
[1:09:49] old on don't even know nothing about it
[1:09:50] there's a little old grape thing grows
[1:09:51] out in the woods and it's bitters qu ey
[1:09:53] we used to to eat them they call Fox
[1:09:56] grapes they claim a fox what eats them
[1:09:58] so they call them Fox grapes listen to
[1:10:00] one other day and he said something
[1:10:01] about Fox
[1:10:07] grapes you see
[1:10:09] Church it don't do no good to
[1:10:15] hide try to cover
[1:10:21] up W do you a bit of good
[1:10:25] your sins the Bible says going to find
[1:10:27] you
[1:10:28] out so the best thing to do is just say
[1:10:30] I'm
[1:10:31] sorry forgive
[1:10:36] me let's move
[1:10:41] on you see that's what we can do with
[1:10:43] one another that's right you simply just
[1:10:47] say I'm sorry that's
[1:10:50] right and just move on then
[1:10:55] of course you can do like a man did work
[1:10:56] down there one day he said something
[1:10:58] about me I said you ought not to be
[1:11:00] saying that now you you apologize to
[1:11:03] me he said all right all right I
[1:11:08] apologize I'm going to say it to you I'm
[1:11:11] sorry that you're
[1:11:18] sorry see we want always to have an out
[1:11:21] that's right there something way to
[1:11:24] handle
[1:11:25] something instead of just saying I'm
[1:11:29] sorry let's
[1:11:32] stand there no loopholes in the
[1:11:35] Bible no places for us to crawl
[1:11:38] through but if we will yield ourselves
[1:11:41] to God and confess our faults the Bible
[1:11:44] said he's just and will forgive
[1:11:46] us then when he forgives us what is
[1:11:51] it come on what is it we've been through
[1:11:53] justification what is it we say I'm
[1:11:56] sorry he said you never done
[1:12:02] it why because they had an advocate you
[1:12:05] remember bam trying to go down and curse
[1:12:07] Israel or B one of the two there you
[1:12:11] know and you know he was telling God now
[1:12:14] God you know what they're
[1:12:17] doing he said I don't see
[1:12:22] it I I don't see
[1:12:25] it what about a God that could tell the
[1:12:27] devil and the devil tell him you know
[1:12:29] they done it here's where they done it
[1:12:31] I'll show you the picture of
[1:12:33] it right and he
[1:12:36] says they never done
[1:12:41] it said because you don't see the
[1:12:44] blood that I'm looking
[1:12:50] through I had a lot of quotes in here
[1:12:52] and all but you ought to know
[1:12:57] it there's no sin to a
[1:13:01] Christian why because we're going to
[1:13:05] repent it's not that we don't do wrong
[1:13:08] it's that we disbelieve that we can ask
[1:13:10] God to forgive us and he will forgive us
[1:13:14] praise
[1:13:16] God so I'd rather believe in the
[1:13:19] atonement than to believe how righteous
[1:13:21] I
[1:13:22] am
[1:13:26] but I find out there's none of my
[1:13:28] righteousness any
[1:13:30] good brother R said on the token
[1:13:34] message he said he cannot impute sin
[1:13:36] over that
[1:13:38] token the tokens of baptism of the Holy
[1:13:41] Ghost if you have that baptism of the
[1:13:43] Holy Ghost you're not going to die and
[1:13:45] go to hell it wouldn't matter how bad
[1:13:47] you
[1:13:47] sined you could never sin enough his
[1:13:50] brother Mo used to make the statement
[1:13:51] you can't sin enough to be lost if
[1:13:53] you're saved but if you're saved you do
[1:13:56] not want to
[1:14:01] sin and then truly you don't want to try
[1:14:03] to justify it and cover it up or blame
[1:14:05] somebody
[1:14:11] else we done what we
[1:14:15] done we ask God to forgive us what we
[1:14:18] done I don't have to ask God to forgive
[1:14:20] me what you
[1:14:22] done you you don't have to ask God to
[1:14:24] forgive you or what I
[1:14:27] done is what we
[1:14:31] do think on these things go number 47 in
[1:14:35] the spiral
[1:14:36] book number 47 anybody have a
[1:14:39] need I
[1:14:41] know not why God's wonderous Grace to me
[1:14:48] he has
[1:14:51] made anybody have a name oh why
[1:14:55] unworthy Christ in love redeemed me
[1:15:04] his but I
[1:15:07] know it's
[1:15:10] morning so let's
[1:15:13] believe that God will provide
[1:15:16] away and he has through the blood of
[1:15:19] Jesus
[1:15:21] Christ and our he is based upon what we
[1:15:24] can
[1:15:27] believe
[1:15:29] right we have
[1:15:33] condemnation I didn't finish the
[1:15:36] message brother Mo years ago I wrote it
[1:15:39] in my Bible an
[1:15:42] order if you go to be prayed for first
[1:15:45] thing
[1:15:50] repent no no I want to be healed
[1:15:55] first thing
[1:15:58] repentance you know why cuz then you can
[1:16:01] never come to the basis if you don't
[1:16:03] repent your heart will automatically
[1:16:06] condemn
[1:16:09] you but if you repent then you can say I
[1:16:15] repented but your heart will
[1:16:16] automatically condemn
[1:16:19] you but God is greater than that heart
[1:16:22] so it turn around and convict us and
[1:16:25] we'll ask for
[1:16:28] forgiveness you know the prophet
[1:16:30] preached a whole message on
[1:16:33] it to be healed confess your
[1:16:39] sins our little buddy doesn't have that
[1:16:41] kind of
[1:16:42] problem he just a little
[1:16:47] fell I'm talking about you and I the
[1:16:49] confidence we can have in
[1:16:52] God
[1:16:53] if our heart don't condemn us we've got
[1:16:55] confidence the Bible
[1:16:59] says well I want God to cleanse
[1:17:04] me right now that I have no
[1:17:10] condemnation so that I can pray for
[1:17:14] him
[1:17:16] right our first thing is God forgive
[1:17:20] me cleanse me
[1:17:23] you make me worthy that I can pray Lord
[1:17:28] Jesus we
[1:17:31] believe even though we could be guilty
[1:17:33] of all kind of sins a moment ago we ask
[1:17:35] to be
[1:17:36] forgiven and we believe that if we're
[1:17:39] honest and confess our
[1:17:41] faults that you'll forgive us now we
[1:17:45] come before our little
[1:17:46] buddy bringing him before thy Throne
[1:17:49] this old Heche this that's hurting the
[1:17:51] body this tempure

[1:17:58] Jesus Christ believing that by your
[1:18:01] stripes he's healed we count it if any
