[1:26] first 10 minutes or so an answer try to
[1:29] answer your question right so we are
[1:32] charged so everybody knows now that the
[1:36] first day of the Jewish religious
[1:41] calendar is what its needs nissin nissin
[1:46] nissin is the first God told when they
[1:50] left of Egypt God told them to how old
[1:53] that month as the first month of the
[1:55] year right unless that's the first year
[1:58] that's the first day the first month the
[2:00] gods of that will begin your year we
[2:03] read it in Scripture a long time about
[2:04] 18 or 20 times ago all right so nissen
[2:08] is the start of the religious calendar
[2:12] all right now the start of the civil
[2:14] calendar if you've got your paperwork
[2:15] over here look right here it says civil
[2:18] calendar their civil calendar starts in
[2:21] our september-october that's their civil
[2:25] calendar okay all right right here I
[2:28] wrote it right there its own your
[2:29] paperwork simple calendar hey nice their
[2:34] civil calendar starts here that really
[2:36] has nothing to do with damage them into
[2:38] weeds but it does have something to do
[2:40] with Israel because they go by that time
[2:42] all right just the Kingdom of Israel I
[2:45] want to say or the Israel is instead of
[2:49] state goes by that or as a country all
[2:54] right and the Orthodox you and all the
[2:56] religious world of Israel goes by
[3:00] missing one over there it's January know
[3:07] that mutt start stay here no there which
[3:11] one you don't well their civil calendar
[3:14] if it starts in September and we're in
[3:18] the fifth month here what about that one
[3:22] what's your question it is in April I
[3:25] mean is it
[3:25] over there no no listen this one more
[3:32] time this is their civil calendar not
[3:35] ours there this is their calendar they
[3:38] don't have gained wife everyone march
[3:40] april may right he doesn't know inside
[3:42] cars actually january remember we went
[3:45] back and showed in history the january
[3:47] was a Roman pagan god named Janice and
[3:52] supposedly that was the rising of Janice
[3:54] and that's why they they pick the Romans
[3:57] big game with Merck as their new year
[4:01] I'd say a lot of the names of week and
[4:04] months or name buddy planets which are
[4:07] named by god it's correct right there
[4:09] Lanka flip oh my god it's true last room
[4:12] we're really a lot of our things that we
[4:15] do our come from a pagan origin because
[4:18] we're heathens were Gentiles that's why
[4:20] we're separated from this part of the
[4:23] Jewish nation cocina we never we never
[4:26] used missing and you know we never began
[4:29] with these because these were God's
[4:32] dates that he said for his children of
[4:35] Israel everything else is Gentile
[4:38] everything else just notice there's no
[4:40] number there's no set date you
[4:43] understand one thing but with Israel
[4:45] there's twelve tribe 144,000 / tribe
[4:48] there's a set date God told them that
[4:52] from nissen 12 nissen 14 put the lamb up
[4:59] get it ready and on the fourteenth day
[5:01] you had to pass over now what was that
[5:05] according it was according to the
[5:08] children of Israel have a Passover they
[5:10] killed the lamb right then they left
[5:13] thee to go the 14th day of nisin is to
[5:17] pass over or not now remember i said
[5:21] 14-day it it's not always the date
[5:24] remember cuz you got your calendar
[5:26] swapping back and forth okay cuz you
[5:30] can't make and you can't make Jesus on
[5:34] Palm Sunday 8030 equal a second
[5:37] and then six days later he died from the
[5:40] second third fourth fifth seat going to
[5:42] sell if he died that's not 14 but it is
[5:45] 14 days after that ever that new moon
[5:48] started okay because he was killed it
[5:51] pass over right we know that where it's
[5:53] annette you killed it pass over so
[5:55] remember it technically you don't really
[5:57] count days you got to go last one said
[6:00] the lunar calendar is the closest thing
[6:02] you can get but it's not a hum percent
[6:04] perfect right so months this month of
[6:10] adar they go out remember they look if
[6:13] there's a sliver of moon left they go
[6:15] right back and start that month again it
[6:18] gives you 13 months sometimes it starts
[6:21] exactly on that or a few days different
[6:25] back and forth but it was when two
[6:27] people would go out that's what refresh
[6:29] your memory when two people will go out
[6:30] so we're going to get into some date do
[6:33] people would go out may I whatever may
[6:36] be that may job but somebody in the
[6:38] religious realm or the astronomical
[6:41] around with glad look and they would go
[6:43] back and tell the priest and the priest
[6:45] would step out and declare what it was
[6:49] ok so you priest is the one that
[6:51] declared the time that miss and want
[6:54] miss someone began ok right that's one
[7:00] of it you got to be careful with all
[7:01] your exact dates because you know God's
[7:06] exact he knows exactly what day this is
[7:08] versus the dawn of creation time and
[7:13] that's why the Jews have went back as
[7:15] far as they could and this is like year
[7:16] what 59 they don't have a year nineteen
[7:20] seventy seven or 19 30 2016 they go by
[7:23] year 7452 they have went back all the
[7:27] way to creation and tracked it by days
[7:30] just you know ever 12 every 24 hour
[7:33] cycle they have a day and we're in I
[7:36] don't know what it is but somebody look
[7:37] it up
[7:38] like seven thousands on the day or
[7:40] something like that all right because
[7:42] remember it's been six thousand years
[7:46] first two thousand years he had the
[7:48] flood saving two thousand years he had
[7:50] Jesus next two thousand years now here
[7:52] we are at the end in that six thousand
[7:54] day day you know cuz remember the
[7:58] calendars have been changed things have
[8:00] been flip-flopped back and forth that's
[8:03] one God's hiding it but he does come to
[8:06] a place to where he tells the Jews this
[8:07] is your day this is the day we're gonna
[8:09] have seventy weeks are determined so the
[8:12] seven new is determined let's see if we
[8:15] know one begins we ought to know when it
[8:17] ends because it begins an end no no
[8:19] that's donut day but within that year of
[8:22] that time alright because I've ever for
[8:25] 45pc is when the Edit went out but it
[8:27] took a 52 days to build a wall to finish
[8:29] it so sometime in that year started this
[8:33] first week our first seven years of 70
[8:38] weeks a day that 49 year then the 62 for
[8:41] the 14 to seven weeks 62 week made 69
[8:45] and we proved by the Bible and the
[8:47] prophets message that 69 weeks or finish
[8:50] nuts not 67 and are not 69 79 80 k if
[8:56] you can't have a half here and there for
[8:57] the 69 years have been finished for 69
[9:00] weeks 69 times seven alright so there's
[9:06] one more week left because if you take
[9:08] 483 years is already finished there's a
[9:11] break for the Gentiles then there's one
[9:14] week left after the rapture and we're
[9:16] going to read it next Sunday we'll start
[9:18] reading quotes right but I want you to
[9:21] see this because what happens it pass
[9:26] over now after the children of Israel
[9:30] have left once you come back and start
[9:33] studying Passover once a year once a
[9:39] year they put one lamb up for 14 days
[9:42] all right you had sacrifices all the
[9:45] time for different things
[9:47] okay sin offering trespass all these
[9:49] things but once a year the high priest
[9:53] went in on Passover took one lamb killed
[9:58] that one lamp and that was the symbol of
[10:04] Jesus Christ one man died but what it
[10:07] was they would come in and they would
[10:08] kill that lamb he would sprinkle the
[10:10] blood come back out and Israel as a
[10:13] nation was covered till the next year
[10:16] that's called the Passover right now you
[10:19] know what pass over it okay one more
[10:24] time the Death Angel passed over the
[10:30] children of Israel that had put the
[10:32] blood on the doorpost that's why it's
[10:35] called Passover it really doesn't
[10:37] connect you can't you say Passover it
[10:39] doesn't say let's not commit anything by
[10:41] killing of a lamb but God told them that
[10:44] if they would do when he said kill the
[10:47] lamb remember eat it but the blood over
[10:49] the doorpost that the death angel that
[10:52] came through remember firstborn of every
[10:54] child and first warned about me first
[10:56] one of every family and the first point
[10:59] even of the animals we're going to die
[11:02] right but but God told Moses to put the
[11:07] blood over the doorpost and I tonight I
[11:10] will pass over you if you do what I tell
[11:15] you to do and then the next day they
[11:17] went out they left all right so that's
[11:19] what pass over means God passed over
[11:22] them forgive them of their sin passed
[11:26] over whatever they ain't got them out of
[11:28] Egypt same thing with when Jesus was on
[11:31] the cross he was on the cross he was
[11:33] killed it pass over the Passover lamb
[11:35] one lamb not many lambs one lamb one
[11:39] lamb was killed it pass over got it the
[11:43] blood was sprinkled the priest went in
[11:44] once here remember took the blood in by
[11:46] self novela 20 way by yourself he went
[11:48] in sprinkled the blood where vs. Holy of
[11:52] Holies you went right totally because
[11:57] remember
[11:58] all your other sacrifices were dealing
[12:01] with the outside in that courtyard right
[12:04] you didn't go inside the Holy of Holies
[12:07] and slay a lamb called only one priest
[12:10] could go into the holy of holies I was
[12:11] there so they killed the lamb though and
[12:14] but he took the blood as a symbol and
[12:16] when he walked into that holy moly the
[12:18] dredge came down and it was him and the
[12:20] blood and God if you went out without
[12:23] the blood they haven't dragged him out
[12:24] because he's head all right Murph he did
[12:27] anything wrong right he was dead man I
[12:30] have a checklist posted them up I'd have
[12:33] a hat with a thing postage right here
[12:34] told what to do make sure you don't
[12:35] forget anything but only had to do those
[12:38] take take blood in there once a year
[12:39] sprinkling on the wall them Holies right
[12:43] God would come down and accept that
[12:45] sacrifice if I got that because this is
[12:48] going to be important because the only
[12:51] way to desecrate that is it somebody to
[12:53] go into that Holy of Holies and make it
[12:57] desolate because God will not accept but
[13:02] the sacrifice the heat said that he
[13:04] would accept that's the high priest
[13:06] dress to dress to the way he told them
[13:08] to dress take the blood and sprinkle on
[13:10] the doorpost turn around come out and
[13:12] that's it you know right if I got that
[13:16] let's pass over so Passover is somebody
[13:21] goes into the holy of holies makes one
[13:25] sprinkling and comes back out God
[13:28] accepts that till the next year
[13:32] everybody got that right so this is
[13:37] where we're going to look at some dates
[13:38] now of course the other fees now you got
[13:40] feast of unleavened bread they eat
[13:43] unleavened bread for 14 days they take
[13:45] all the way one out of the house need
[13:46] unleavened bread which is that real flat
[13:48] bread that we eat for communion that's
[13:50] pretty much unleavened bread there's
[13:52] nothing to make it rise all right then
[13:56] to feast of firstfruits remember you had
[13:58] a sheep way then because remember this
[14:01] is all in the spring things are starting
[14:02] to come up they're not mature yet though
[14:05] hear me they're not one to where they're
[14:07] just
[14:08] coming up and get their green you got
[14:11] your hay field and your your wheat
[14:13] fields out there you don't harvest them
[14:14] things when they're green because you
[14:17] know what you're going to get beer
[14:20] that's what Hopsin on it they harvest it
[14:23] in the green time and it's got so much
[14:25] fermentation in it too less how they
[14:27] make beer and stuff lead but you have to
[14:30] wait till it's dead and dry now we're
[14:31] talking about wailing over here in the
[14:32] harvest time but at first the feast of
[14:35] firstfruits priest would go out look at
[14:38] the field and if it was a certain group
[14:40] that was higher than the next that was
[14:42] coming more to maturity than the other
[14:44] ones he'd go and cut that down walk out
[14:48] and wave it across the people and say
[14:51] hey this is growing now this is growing
[14:55] this is the first fruit the first thing
[14:57] to come up that come to the more mature
[14:59] and what happened on the day of
[15:01] resurrection it was the first free Jesus
[15:06] was the birth divided tones he's the
[15:08] first fruit from the dead it was the
[15:10] first one to ever resurrect in any
[15:13] mortal body now remember Lazarus had
[15:17] resurrected several others in the Old
[15:20] Testament had resurrected but they died
[15:22] Jesus was the only one that resurrected
[15:24] into immortality all right so he's the
[15:27] first proof that come up and showing
[15:29] though that that that part had come to
[15:32] maturity and that the rest of the field
[15:34] maybe be a little bit behind but it's
[15:37] coming up to but you don't harvest it
[15:40] right you let it mature you let it keep
[15:43] growing you let the life come up to the
[15:46] stock or the to shoot them into 22
[15:50] leaves the stock and it begins to start
[15:54] growing them the week but the week seed
[15:58] is not mature until you get over here
[16:03] cuz this is harvest time remember this
[16:05] is the harvest time so that's why
[16:07] they're civil calendars won't fit their
[16:09] first part of the year as is real first
[16:12] part of the year starts right about
[16:14] september-october well how you start
[16:17] something and
[16:18] you know then you go harvest it right
[16:20] then don't tell ones then God has to
[16:23] keep it in continuity planning a spring
[16:25] right harvested in september-october
[16:29] because remember if you'll know by the
[16:31] moon's that this is very striking
[16:33] ailment you listen to this there's two
[16:36] moons that are very important in the
[16:39] world once called the Harvest Moon and
[16:44] once called the Hunter's Moon the
[16:46] hunter's moon is in November that's when
[16:48] usually your procreation of your animals
[16:51] the deer and all the things that come
[16:52] into they come into fertility during the
[16:56] hundreds of men which is in November
[16:58] that's the full moon and no ever but the
[17:01] full moon in October they call it the
[17:03] harvest man in white obviously because
[17:06] the fruit right but in the olden times
[17:10] they harvested all night they couldn't
[17:14] get to listen the other day I went by
[17:17] play a farm to have one of those sickle
[17:19] things that you ride the horse pulls it
[17:21] and it's about this long and it's got
[17:25] the blades and as the wheels turn the
[17:26] blade would do this My heavens to do an
[17:30] anchor it take you half a day now with
[17:34] the tractor we can do 100 acres and a
[17:37] half a day so it took them they
[17:39] literally worked all night and the moon
[17:41] was so bright look at your moon in
[17:43] October that money is so bright it even
[17:45] cast shadows well they would work on
[17:48] that that's called the harvest moon
[17:49] because they would harvest they never
[17:50] stopped when Sun went down it they just
[17:52] kept going to harvesting the product so
[17:55] that's where you get your harvest men so
[17:59] that loan is really important but I want
[18:01] you to realize something that took it's
[18:04] going to be very important so then you
[18:05] got feast of Pentecost which is what
[18:09] happens 50 days after Jesus was killed
[18:13] hmm no this is the feast of pink of
[18:17] Pentecost penta is what why is the
[18:21] pentagon called the Pentagon
[18:23] because it has five sides penta okay
[18:30] they came under the 50th which was the
[18:34] first year of the next forty nine but it
[18:36] was they do on that 50th year they have
[18:40] a day called pentecost and the Holy
[18:45] Ghost fell when that day had fully come
[18:47] to hold those vows but it wasn't an
[18:50] extra one year you got to keep
[18:52] remembering that you can't keep every
[18:54] Jubilee here you can't keep adding years
[18:57] you got to leave it at 49 years then 149
[19:01] then one but that one year of the next
[19:04] Jubilee cycle is there Jubilee and every
[19:08] 49 years the next year was a golden
[19:12] jubilee number it will right here
[19:17] Leviticus 25 8 we ready number your
[19:20] seven Sabbath or seven you don't want to
[19:23] call us about call it survival why are
[19:26] you going to sabbatical you don't do
[19:28] anything your ass right why it's why you
[19:31] know you professor is going sabbatical
[19:33] if you work for a huge company they'll
[19:36] give you some radical take a month off
[19:37] let's want to sound with his its arrest
[19:39] that's what it's Sabbath means is rest
[19:41] alright so 77 649 all right on that 49
[19:47] year the next year was the first year of
[19:49] the next cycle but it was a golden pupil
[19:53] they kept up with it if you read back in
[19:56] history though they never literally held
[20:00] that feast I said literally now bad
[20:03] Pentecost just when it was pointing
[20:05] toward you got that the day of Pentecost
[20:08] when the Holy Ghost fell that's why mad
[20:10] fellows because it was only a jubilee
[20:12] here if you're going again today you are
[20:16] energy bleeder you're not the 49 you're
[20:19] not enough s7 right 777 is what
[20:23] completion but eight is eternity you

[22:35] us there's not an 8th turkey
[22:38] we have to go back to the first which is
[22:41] what line 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 12
[22:49] to them there's no 8 day but to be
[22:53] eternal you have to make an eighth day
[22:56] you have to say it's something different
[22:58] listen eternity is different than
[23:00] anything we know about right that's why
[23:03] I look at an eternity of something
[23:05] different I thing but um I was listening
[23:08] to a song the other day about gotta wipe
[23:12] her tears and all those things won't
[23:15] have to you know we have days like this
[23:20] sorrow joy sorrow joy if it was sorry
[23:25] what if it was joy and you don't even
[23:28] know what sorrow is see we can't humanly
[23:32] comprehend that because we have startled
[23:35] or something we're equipped for that
[23:37] star on Joyce aren't going but they'll
[23:39] be one day we'll be just like that line
[23:41] right there maybe all joy you said how's
[23:46] it going to happen listen like some
[23:49] things God is going to have to do that
[23:50] we can't understand cuz in our humanity
[23:53] we know there's joy and sorrow we know
[23:55] about all that but what about a day when
[23:57] there's no fear now listen
[24:02] yeah yeah I'll be keeping you come to a
[24:04] place to where you don't fear those bees
[24:06] and they know that they fear you that's
[24:07] the best the whole thing happened in the
[24:09] garden when Adam and Eve were in the
[24:12] garden and the lion and the lamb laid
[24:14] down together there was no fear factor
[24:17] of the highest form creation which is
[24:19] with adam and eve but once they remember
[24:23] I told you that God said where are you
[24:24] at him out and said I was afraid he had
[24:27] never been afraid in his life that's me
[24:30] that's why I tell about these people
[24:32] thanks Randall millennium I want you to
[24:34] go and I won't throw you in with the
[24:36] lines and let's see how that fear factor
[24:39] takes over i will put you in up in a
[24:42] bowl snakes poisonous ones obviously yes
[24:46] maybe put a couple of boat constrictors
[24:48] in there may be some you're already
[24:50] scared now if I put one in this flooring
[24:52] it right down through there guess what
[24:53] empty room don't make me have to go to
[24:57] hospitals if you run over the other
[24:58] person but so there's things that we
[25:02] don't know but we got to get ready
[25:04] that's what we're talking about life not
[25:05] the bible study whether that whether it
[25:07] ends in 2019 we gotta get ready there is
[25:11] going to be a time when the rapture is
[25:12] going to take place and it can't be far
[25:15] off look at this new club we got a new
[25:18] president coming in 2017 alright
[25:21] whatever whoever it's going to be if we
[25:24] do get out of here in 2019 you know
[25:26] that's another that's another election
[25:27] year something I mean they're coming up
[25:32] to the next of twenty twenty years when
[25:33] the next election in so you're looking
[25:35] at a time period in there whether it's
[25:37] going to be a lot of turmoil I think
[25:39] whether Trump gets it or whoever gets it
[25:41] doesn't matter these next few years are
[25:43] going to be are going to tell the tale
[25:45] close ever taste kind of setup which
[25:47] should be now correct you know is what's
[25:50] looking like they're looking America is
[25:52] now against this room with that's what
[25:53] that's what they said you know Oh down
[25:55] through the ages if you brother Brown
[25:57] said America is enjoying success because
[26:02] of their relationship with Israel now
[26:05] when we break that relationship with
[26:06] Israel the Bible says the nation did
[26:09] that in other words goes against Israel
[26:11] he'll be against the nation is for
[26:13] Israel that's all
[26:14] is keeping the ramp off the bus besides
[26:16] are still being here is that we have
[26:18] been Israel friend but when we turn
[26:20] against Israel trouble big time alright
[26:24] so let's go back to this real quick for
[26:27] a few minutes so everybody got that love
[26:33] to pick off that's when the Holy old
[26:36] spell read your Bible the Bible says
[26:38] when the day of Pentecost had fully come
[26:40] right okay that was that's why they were
[26:43] all gathered the feast of Pentecost
[26:46] these were feast the enjoying him the
[26:47] head they had festivities you know it
[26:49] wasn't he wasn't something that they
[26:52] just love let's go note if you read back
[26:55] in Leviticus there was three feats that
[26:58] you were required to attend the other
[27:02] ones but all males in the household
[27:05] habit of 10 3 feet all right so remember
[27:09] that just hang on to that now watch so
[27:13] you gotta be spent on then you got a
[27:15] long period of time if you read brother
[27:17] branham many times he mentions he said
[27:19] you got the dead Pentecost 50 days ever
[27:20] he said then there's a long period of
[27:22] time what there's a long period of time
[27:25] two thousand years of Gentile when I say
[27:29] this I'm not pointing this way I'm
[27:30] pointing back over here wolf where we
[27:32] were before where you got your little
[27:34] circles on your other chart all right
[27:37] now obviously a Gentile when we get born
[27:41] again that's our damn take off but there
[27:44] is a little time that they have a
[27:47] Pentecostal feast in Israel okay never
[27:50] have a cycle that they go through
[27:51] alright so now there's a long period of
[27:55] time many many days one two three four
[27:57] months physically on the calendar until
[28:01] the Feast of Trumpets they blow the
[28:04] trumpet when brother Ron Cey trumpet
[28:06] means what an announcement at the last
[28:10] Trump on the trumpet shall sound Feast
[28:12] of Trumpets nobody got that all right
[28:15] save time when i'll explain tomorrow you
[28:18] i want to read them or look at Google
[28:20] Feast of Trumpets you'll read for months
[28:23] okay and I'm telling you let me tell you
[28:26] one more thing
[28:27] a lot of these things i did get off the
[28:30] internet but a lot of things brother
[28:33] branham god he got out of books he just
[28:34] didn't have the Internet in out google
[28:36] he had physically search them to both
[28:39] olanna scripts and your eyes smithing
[28:42] and Clarence Larkin he went back and
[28:45] studied those people but when he done
[28:47] though was he was a prophet through the
[28:49] filter of the Holy Ghost he could say
[28:51] all right well that that part's good up
[28:54] to here badness is good up to a certain
[28:59] point Methodist is good after a certain
[29:02] point but what they didn't do is they
[29:04] didn't go on with God to put the wood
[29:06] and having a word to put it together to
[29:09] keep continuing on into the Word of God
[29:12] but now we had a prophet William Brown
[29:14] come raise us up not just him he raised
[29:18] us up so that we can see in all
[29:21] directions have be prophetic that we can
[29:24] take this information there's one thing
[29:26] for sure I put the Bible prophets
[29:31] message and then anything else and I'm
[29:34] talking about me brother Dale anybody I
[29:36] don't care what creature that you've got
[29:38] to go on or profit as a highest or you
[29:40] can go in and then know what brothers
[29:42] profits there you go the Bible which
[29:46] brother brown said face final resting
[29:47] place is in the Word of God let's grow
[29:50] alright if it seems contrary if brother
[29:52] branham seems contrary what he said go
[29:55] back to the Bible running through your
[29:56] filter again and you'll find out there
[29:58] brother Brennan was saying exactly won't
[30:00] even meant to say if it hides it from
[30:03] you hides it from me I'm just I'm sorry
[30:05] that's what i was saying let's not Bible
[30:07] study have you heard any preacher ever
[30:09] preach on 1977 never have I heard of
[30:14] minister stand up say I'm gonna explain
[30:16] to you why the Bradford didn't place
[30:17] take place in that position because they
[30:20] don't know i'm not saying i know but i
[30:23] understand one thing for sure I know if
[30:25] he if he plugged it in to this right
[30:27] here then we can go back to Leviticus 25
[30:31] 8 and find out why the rapture didn't
[30:33] play take place in 1977 cuz it wasn't
[30:38] a 50th according to the benefits 2510
[30:42] the villages 2510 would have been that
[30:45] was the end of it but he said it was a
[30:49] 70th you believe since the beginning of
[30:51] Jubilees according to Leviticus 25 8
[30:54] which is seven times seven that's where
[30:57] you had 77 and had 49 years you get 20
[31:00] 26 ad ok cuz the next you believe cycle
[31:04] will start on 20 20 20 27 and that would
[31:09] be the 71st you believe well 71 x 70 is
[31:13] more than four hundred nine so that's
[31:16] that's what I'm concluding is that we
[31:18] can't go past 20 26 because if that's
[31:22] true we got to 71st Jubilee and there is
[31:24] no 74 whew bleep sandwich 7 is 49 49
[31:29] seventy times seven is 490 all right
[31:33] that's all the time allotted on this
[31:36] earth for God to deal because remember
[31:40] remember what we got a few minutes
[31:45] remember that mark right there does not
[31:50] end time
[31:55] it is the time of the seventy weeks of
[31:59] Daniel got it that doesn't in time add a
[32:09] thousand years to that because even if
[32:15] you'll read if you've been reading I
[32:16] went back in the Old Testament pulling
[32:18] up some real nuggets in Ezekiel and
[32:20] Zachariah there's going to be day and
[32:23] night still not in the temple not in the
[32:27] new city let me tell why not the temple
[32:28] not in the new city then you see the
[32:30] video milk it'll be daylight all the
[32:32] time all right but outside they're going
[32:37] to have day or night they're not they're
[32:40] not harvest I'm planting reaping all the
[32:44] way for a thousand more years so don't
[32:45] get me wrong say well that's when x
[32:47] going to end times not going to end the
[32:50] seventy weeks of Daniel has the
[32:53] beginning therefore it must come to an
[32:55] end that's right seventy weeks are
[32:58] determined God determined seventy weeks
[33:02] for the redemption of Israel he redeems
[33:07] us inside of that then he redeems the
[33:10] city okay so this is the part of okay
[33:16] that's why it's going to take I want to
[33:17] ask one more question how can you do
[33:20] this the six fold purpose has to be
[33:22] inside of Daniel seventy weeks right so
[33:25] many weeks are determined upon by people
[33:27] on the ball now holy city to what finish
[33:29] the transgression make an end of Stan
[33:31] make reconciliation for iniquity bring
[33:33] in everlasting righteousness set up the
[33:35] vision and promised in our North the
[33:36] most holy how you going to do that only
[33:38] three and a half years because you got a
[33:40] battle of Armageddon right here how you
[33:42] gonna bring in everlasting righteous and
[33:44] how you gonna do four or five and six
[33:45] can see the most people don't actually
[33:48] say that they damage they can we can end
[33:50] right here
[33:54] no the Ministry of Jesus Christ ends
[33:56] right here but there's one week left
[33:59] Africa a trip to fulfil the seventy
[34:02] weeks of Daniel that's where the people
[34:04] on the message can't separate it because
[34:07] brother Branham he puts it together for
[34:10] me to hide it God here in front listen
[34:13] if it was so easy to understand
[34:15] everybody would understand it but nobody
[34:16] understands it so there's only gonna be
[34:18] a special group of people it's going to
[34:20] be able to understand it that word
[34:21] determined means divide divide that in
[34:25] that use its means divide seventy weeks
[34:28] are divided same thing it's determined
[34:31] its divided in this three section the
[34:33] other all right but remember don't say
[34:35] that I said that the world's going to
[34:38] end I mean the time hands in twenty
[34:39] twenty six World Order of time Indra
[34:43] here you got meat World Order of time
[34:47] will hand right there the Battle of
[34:49] Armageddon will be man throwing a comic
[34:53] nuclear gases horrible stuff we've never
[34:57] seen before and we ain't going to see
[35:00] para 44,000 nothing to see but there's
[35:03] going to be a physical battle right here
[35:05] of people throwing things at people that
[35:09] you've probably never seen and don't
[35:11] want to see in Zechariah it talks about
[35:15] their eyeballs melting in their socket
[35:20] and their flesh falling off their bone
[35:22] what is that nuclear what nuclear
[35:26] fallout because remember the Battle of
[35:28] Armageddon not gonna kill her plan today
[35:31] you can throw every ball everybody's got
[35:33] there are certain places an angle hit if
[35:36] I got that so they're going to die of
[35:39] nuclear fallout it may take a year they
[35:42] don't matter to me I just don't want to
[35:45] be here when I happened
[35:47] hey man cuz remember your food spurgeon
[35:50] you learn 44,000 and your two witnesses
[35:52] are going to be gone when that battle
[35:54] begin nobody but heathen that's going to
[35:57] be demons fighting demons human demon
[36:00] not that because remember the spirits
[36:02] who don't still live on spirits live on
[36:04] through the thousand-year this is going
[36:06] to be suppressed right that's why it's
[36:09] still time all right until you go into
[36:12] that wat don't get been in the Battle of
[36:14] Gog and Magog Gog and Magog is a
[36:16] spiritual Bible and God's going to kill
[36:19] all them demons spirits and then all
[36:22] right so you got that but watch now we
[36:25] talked about Passover and I want you to
[36:27] see this just before we get started
[36:28] pulling it for next week Passover is in
[36:38] you get it right here Passover is in
[36:41] this and one right inition 14 somewhere
[36:44] in that month of nisin right ok that's
[36:48] when the priests now watch when we leave
[36:51] out of here brother branham tells us
[36:54] that the Jews will set up temple worship
[36:56] that's what they're looking for they
[36:58] need the menorah they need the red
[37:03] heifer they need the ark let's just say
[37:09] let's just some eyes that that treaty
[37:12] that because he's got those things we
[37:14] prove Rome has those things Rome has
[37:17] although when Titus destroyed the temple
[37:19] he didn't leave that go laying around
[37:22] because remember everything was in late
[37:24] and laid with gold all kind of things
[37:27] silver know you think you think that
[37:30] even left that goal in Israel knew he
[37:34] took it all back to mama so Rome holds
[37:37] the whole thing that israel needs to set
[37:40] up temple worship so what the boats
[37:43] going to do is he's just going to say in
[37:44] so many times he's going to say you want
[37:46] temple worship yes alright i'm going to
[37:49] give you because remember you don't the
[37:51] devil got to give you something don't
[37:53] hold nothing in return the Dead will
[37:54] give you something he won't something
[37:56] right so he's going to make a covenant
[37:59] with the Jews Nico say okay here's the
[38:01] menorah here's your holy holy now set up
[38:04] the temple we're gonna have peace for
[38:06] three and four seven years but what he's
[38:10] going to do is he's going to have to
[38:11] deal with two prophets in hundred
[38:13] forty-four thousand during that time
[38:14] they gonna really make him mad so what
[38:19] he's going to do is if you if you look
[38:21] and we're going to read it next Sunday
[38:22] the abomination right now listen I think
[38:29] we'll read it next Sunday but the Bible
[38:31] on my shorty and Daniel 12 and in Daniel
[38:36] 9 the abomination that maketh desolate
[38:38] we know that's that monster or over
[38:40] there that's a building it's a building
[38:43] castles not even worried about that
[38:46] building mom and then went over there
[38:48] and they're they're digging right up
[38:49] against it and even right under it
[38:51] trying to find those things so it's not
[38:54] really the building it's never been
[38:57] building the building has nothing to do
[38:59] with this whole thing if people right
[39:02] God didn't get mad at a building he
[39:05] didn't get match the buildings of Sodom
[39:07] and Gomorrah he got mad at the people
[39:09] that were in Sodom and Gomorrah right
[39:11] right so what's going to happen is
[39:13] what's going to happen is is is to the
[39:16] way I see it is that that Pope is going
[39:19] to walk in on the day of Passover that's
[39:22] going to be a sacred day because for
[39:24] three and a half years they're going to
[39:25] be making sacrifices and they don't
[39:27] think ma'am we got it going the massage
[39:30] fishing to come we're going to have all
[39:32] this together and a heathen tote walks
[39:37] into that Holy of Holies and the Bible
[39:41] talks about desecration the only way you
[39:44] can desecrate something is put something
[39:47] in there that's not supposed to be there
[39:48] if he desecrates the temple he was in
[39:54] after the after and after in the midst
[39:56] of the week the Bible says in the midst
[39:58] of the week he'll cause the sacrifice
[40:00] and the oblation the seats how was he
[40:03] going to cause it he's going to decimate
[40:05] it because once he walks in the gym
[40:08] say we can't do anything anymore you you
[40:12] you made this place unclean he said
[40:15] don't worry I'm to die remember he's got
[40:17] to come to a place to where he's got he
[40:19] said you got to start worshipping me now
[40:22] then then last one all hexagon bracelet
[40:25] really comes by that time I believe
[40:28] 144,000 is going to be closed or even
[40:30] gone to extra going to be gone your your
[40:34] foots burden is going to be dead so all
[40:36] you got standing is you got jus natural
[40:40] and the Pope the mother of all Hartley
[40:45] so if you take Passover in the midst of
[40:48] the week back it up three and a half
[40:50] years you got October of clean I think
[40:53] so remember from here to here in six
[40:59] months he comes in three and a half
[41:01] years he he comes in the midst of the
[41:03] week three and a half years he's coming
[41:06] here will count backwards three and a
[41:08] half years you got one two three I'm at
[41:16] you gotta back it up go go backwards you
[41:19] got October 2019 she'll think about that
[41:21] so we get we gotta go go go go sorry
[41:24] right over a little bit
