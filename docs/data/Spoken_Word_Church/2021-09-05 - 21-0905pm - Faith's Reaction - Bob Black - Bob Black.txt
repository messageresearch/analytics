watching from home do you believe all things are possible to them that believe and really enjoyed that message this morning i truly believe that was inspired and and it's it's so encouraging to hear a message that falls right in line with the message that i plan to bring this afternoon that just really shows i believe that god has a hand in the message just today and has his hand in it and is watching over us and is mindful of things and and he cares about us amen so this afternoon i just want to speak a little uh a little faith-building message and just kind of build your faith and give you something to edify you and and encourage you along life's road i know like uh so many have said we've got many things to be in prayer about many seems like the the list of prayer requests keeps getting longer and longer and there's there's certainly many things to labor and prayer about and be concerned with but we have a god that can can take care of us and he's ever mindful so this afternoon i want to read from uh first kings chapter 17 but before we go to the scripture let's just go to the author in prayer lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather together and uh even though we're not physically in one place we're gathering around your word lord jesus because we're eagles and we're looking to your word lord god for strength to and we just ask lord that you'll renew our strength this afternoon lord and give us something to help us along life's way lord and i pray god wherever the people are as they listen in and stream and and they'll be encouraged lord of their faith will rise lord jesus rise through whatever gloom that circumstances have have have put upon them lord jesus whatever trials and tribulations they're going through right now oh god i pray lord that you'll just encourage each one as they're listening lord jesus we just bless each one bless each home now bless the little group that's here that's standing by helping the lord things to continue on bless bless all the ones that are listening we pray now in the name of the lord jesus christ so i want to speak this afternoon on on the topic of faith faith's reaction because you know uh when when when things kind of go wrong kind of continuing the thought that brother louise had this morning when things things go wrong and and you're a born-again christian has got it's got the equipment on the inside to respond in a certain way and i believe that's what god is looking for in this hours for for faith to have a right reaction so in first kings chapter 17 verses 1 to 15 it says and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth form whom before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word and of course we know this is the first time that elijah just came on the scene uh just seemingly out of nowhere and he comes on the scene uh with just just uh just as you would say hits the ground running and he says rain is not going to fall but until i say call for it and he says and the word of the lord came unto him saying get thee hints and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherith that is before jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there so he went and did according unto the word of the lord for he went and dwelt by the brook cherith that is before jordan and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land and the word of the lord came unto him saying arise get thee to zarephath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me i pray thee morsel of bread in thine hand and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but a handful of meal and a barrel and a little oil and a cruise and behold i'm gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the crews of oil fail until the day that the lord sendeth the rain upon the earth and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the crews of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now in this story this is this the story is a story of of of of something happening a little story being woven in the time of great gloom and heartache and and depression and sadness with this little woman you you you really you really have to look at it from the perspective of elijah and this little widow woman elijah who was sitting up there and uh maybe thinking that nobody nobody was there and in the time that this story was was is relayed nobody was responding to his message and nobody was listening to him maybe he'd get down and out you know as the scripture talks about how that at one point he came to the to the place where he thought nope uh you know god had to show him that there's seven thousand still left that believe that believe your message and he's up there and he's being fed uh you know he's not holding camp meetings he's not holding youth revival he's up there alone in the mountains sitting by the brook and god's feeding him uh he sends the sins of the ravens to feed him and down that way down in that in that city there's a little widow woman and she's also going through her own trials and she's going through a place where you know her husband has passed away and and now the food is running out and she's coming to a place where you know she didn't have maybe a shotgun to defend their home when all of the all the people would come by to pillage her her her little dwelling place and she's living there like you know all the all the trials that a widow woman would go through any day any you know it in the middle east today or wherever wherever you would be a widow woman it would have would have trials and so she's she's going through a gloomy place and you you see sometimes sometimes we like brother brown said sometimes we get to a place where we don't really have the right kind of confidence that we shouldn't go in god we need to we need to be able to come we need to be able to have confidence that that the the word that we've heard is actually going to accomplish what it says it will do and so god allows us he actually allows us to go through situations and go through trials to kind of to put our faith to a test to to cause that to cause faith to have a reaction you know brother brown points out he says that you know hebrews 13 8 says that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so as we look through all these stories and examine all the stories of the old testament on into the new testament you can be assured that if god ever reacted if you ever did something one way forevermore he's going to do he's going to respond the exact same way his behavior his character his attributes is going to is going to be unchanging and so if he ever responded to someone who reached out to him in faith who stood there steadfastly on god's word who stood steadfastly believing in god's word if he ever did that once he'll do it the same way forevermore i what a confidence that should be to us in this hour that if we'll come with the same kind of faith that elijah had and the same kind of faith that the widow of zarephath had then we'll get the same results that god will respond because we come in faith believing in his word it feel approached in faith and brother branham he would equate it to like like electricity if you can if you can connect the wires together then you're going to have light you can if you flip the light switch on then you're going to have light and so if you can follow the fall of the plan follow that the that that plan of faith that to be able to connect the power switch to the source and what we've got here is we we've actually that's actually what the gospel is the gospel is the connecting force between our earthly humanity and between the supernatural so when we listen to the gospel when we hear the word preached and within our heart we say well i believe that's got to be true when you hear the preaching of the gospel and something within you just echoes that's got to be true it's actually connecting you and your little humanity walking around here in flesh it's connecting you up to the supernatural and that connecting that's that's actually it's connecting you to the source of the supernatural where where you can begin to see something begin to take place in your life something began to take place in this little widow woman's life something began to take place in elijah's life where he was being fed and directed by god and moved down to where he could he could minister to this little widow woman's need and brother branham he begins to talk about how you look at this situation that to maybe one of the most gloomiest maybe the one most depressing situations in the bible a situation of starvation where this little woman had nothing she was down to the last little bit of oil the last little bit of meal she had nothing left one night of food left and she began to get really serious brother brown he begins to describe it he says it must have been a dreadful morning so hot and dusty and people was in the street starving let's just kind of paint a picture in your mind of what the situation there's that woman in her home and she's got one little bit of meal left and one little bit of oil left and people outside of her home laying in the street starving actually dying in the street maybe scream in one place he said screaming and he said the earth was so hot it was ready to burn and that just paints a picture of something just a really dismal terrible looking situation and he said and this was the reflection this natural scene that where maybe you got in your mind now was a reflection of something spiritual it was a reflection of their sins and their moral decay or reflection of the the moral spiritual situation of the of the people of that day and he said ahab was reigning in israel at that time and he was the wickedness of all the kings of israel let's examine why he was the wickedest of all the kings of israel because brother rahm said there had he said there had been no king as wicked as they have being taught and no better so now you've got a king that he was actually instructed in the right way to live he was instructed and how he should do and how he should behave and how he should believe and what the truth was but yeah he laid it to the side and said i'm going to go my own way i'm going to marry jezebel i'm going to do despite all of the teaching that i've had i'm going to go and that you see that began to pile up and made him the most wicked of all the kings of israel now you kind of put put put in this compare that today to the situation that we're living in today looking around at america who's got this background of a christian supposedly a christian country with the backgrounds of pilgrims trying to come to america to to escape the oppression of the roman catholic church and the church of england coming to america for religious freedom so that they could so that they could have have freedom of religion pull the pull the mic down here let me let me know if that if y'all can't hear me okay comparing comparing ahab then to to the to america now and he said you see america has been taught america has heard the gospel but they've rejected it and that makes them the most wicked the most heart you think about how out of this wickedness and out of this like i was preaching last sunday how out of this the most wicked the most darkest age the out of that god has raised up a little bride to be an example to be a light to the world but what made it so what makes it so wicked is because they have heard the truth they've heard that you think of all the all the preachers the great preachers that have risen up billy graham and oral roberts and brother random and billy sunday and all the way down and they yeah and they've turned it down he said being tall and no better he failed not to continue to displease god and everything that he did although he had a great military system and the people had become very prosperous under his reign but yet you cannot displease god and expect to get by very long you can't displease god and expect to get by very long but they had it they see they had a great military system and the people had become very prosperous under this reign exactly echoing exactly typing exactly what america has become now and he said see in this wedding instead of marrying among his own people he went over and married a sinner an idolater worshipper of idols because you see what abe ahab was not looking for character he was looking he was looking on the outward he was looking for something on the outside any real true believer any real true child of god is going to look for character instead of instead of something that just fades away instead of something that that fades away over time sooner or later you know you look at a young couple getting married and sooner or later the the flesh is going to begin to get wrinkled and the hairs are going to begin to turn gray and all the things that maybe that you value so highly when you're young i'm just speaking frankly now all those things will begin to fade away but there's something on that on the inside that's worth more than all that outward appearance that's what a real true believer is going to look for for character on the inside character characters will carry characters what'll keep a little family together character where you put god first and you you're not so worried about all of the temporal pleasures and all the all that how much money you got and whether you got a big boat or a big a big truck or something to drive but character something on the inside and that's what god is interested too god is interested in getting a bride for himself that's got character maybe maybe god's bride is is pulled out from all the different place all the hedges and byways people that have bad backgrounds and people with weak weak experiences you know life life life things that they've come out of but yet god will take that all together and and build himself a bride that's got real character real godly character because that's what that's what god is after and he said that brother brown really lays at home he said no believer should ever marry an unbeliever he talked about ahab and jezebel now look at what ahab was interested in he was interested in in a painted face jezebel somebody that didn't have real the real true uh or we'll say gospel character of that somebody that was willing to listen to the word for their day and adhere to it to wear long hair and dress and want to want to do what's right he said no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances should always marry believers but ahab had done this evil thing and no doubt but what jezebel was a beautiful woman and he'd fell for what she looked like in the stead of what she was so many people make that same mistake to this day so many people get so called up and and have an unequally yoked relationship you know we were talking about that the other day just kind of sitting around because look look how ahab if if ahab would have been trying to to live live the real gospel way with with uh mary to jezebel who wanted none of that how could they how could they walk together how can even you know in the world how could how could a buddhist and a and a catholic walk together they're always going to be at odds maybe one wants to homeschool their kids and one wants to one wants to send them to the to the the to the nun school or something that they're always going to be at odds with one another you know even even in a good christian marriage there's always going to be there's going to be something that you kind of have have a little tension about what how your approach to home school or whether you whether you're going to send your kids to public school but you can't you can't walk together unless you're in agreement so that's why a lot of these things that that are in the bible that brother man taught us told us about are not there just to make us give us something to great at to give us something to be at odds with one another but they're actually there to to give us as a benefit for us something to help us and it will be a help to you young people and if you if you'll really consider these things to that you want to marry somebody that believes the same way that you do that walks the same way so that you can be yoked up with them so that you won't it will remove a lot of the strife and the struggles of life if you'll follow the advice that brother branham has given here that that the word gives here and he said ahab the most wicked king of israel because he married an adulterer he was the most wicked king of israel because he married an idolater despite knowing better and brother ram goes on he said it's a very picture of our country today we have fallen under the popular demand we might we may not think that we're idle worshippers but we are and the government endorses it people today are idle worshipers some of them worship movie stars for idols some worship money for idols and some worship television stars as idols but all that you put before god as an idol let it be whatever it may be and you i think that's so true if you look around today and see how everybody has put some so many things in front of god they'll put they'll put facebook and instagram before god they would rather have a nice looking picture they'd rather they'd rather spend more time posting pictures about how good their food looks or where they went been on vacation than actually worrying about the things of god i i would even say today we're more worried about politics and whether somebody takes a knee at a football game then whether we're actually adhering to the word of god and doing what god's word says we're more more worried about who the president is and and and those kind of things that we are about god's word brother rem said even to satan that great adversary is such a smart one until he even put sometimes the church before god he said you might have a great church it might be a great bill in there it might be a great denomination and again it might be a great congregation but let nothing come before god in your heart if you put anything before god in your heart you are an idol worshiper you know brother rahm said in one place he said our modern trend today fallen away from the things of god and has brought the world to it now listen to what he said one of the greatest idolatries that we have is he said to one of the greatest idolatries that we have and that is idleness like you could you imagine that idleness with just sitting around not willing to do nothing would be one of the greatest idolatries something that you would put before god willing to just just the spirit of the nation the spirit of the age it's just a spirit of slightness not wanting to put your hand to the plow not wanting to do nothing not people not wanting to go to church not wanting to pick up their bible not wanting to spend time in prayer not wanting to do nothing just idle around and let let the preacher do all the living for god let the song leaders or whatever do all the living for god but just isle around and not do nothing for god he said great is the iniquity of the people today making plenty of money i think that god's blessing us because he's prospered us he said that's no sign of god's blessing not at all prosperity is no sign of you know you you examine this story where elijah went down to this little whittle of his hair path and she might be one of the greatest blessed most blessed people in the scripture but yet she had nothing she had nothing and we look around and we we try to be like oh you know listen to all these prosperity preachers that'll tell you well if you'll pay your tithes and you can have a yacht or you can get promoted and you can have all these things but that is not the gospel that's not what the gospel is about the gospel is about somebody that don't have nothing but yet they got god in their heart they don't have they don't have nothing but they've given their whole life to god they've given him a preacher that'll preach the gospel whether or not he's preaching to a fence post whether or not he's on the back side of the desert somewhere and with nobody to listen to that's what the gospel is about you know brother the bible says in deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 5 it says thou shalt love the lord that's the firs that's what jesus said the greatest commandment is thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and all thy might in other words god wants you to give everything like brother louise was talking about this morning he's not god's not so care so much and care about even your body but he wants that heart he wants you to love him with all your heart with all your soul with everything that you've got to give it all to him and yet yes that nation that ahab's nation that the nation that he was the king of this nation that that that used to be a christian nation that used to put god first they came over to america because they were trying to serve god and wanted freedom of religion has become a religious nation that nation was a religious nation and this nation is a religious nation what does religion mean is mean you're trying to cover up that you're trying to cover up what you know is flawed with something else something other than the blood of jesus christ something else you're trying to cover up something that down on the inside that's crooked that's flawed that's messed up he said these people knew that they wasn't spiritual like they used to be under the reigns of other kings and they thought just because there was a religious nation that everything would be all right and that's the way we have come to that place also we think that because we got an american flag flying behind us so we go to like a patriotic thing my wife was she went with with my daughter to the little marching man thing on friday that she's in and she was she kind of observed when they began to when they had to prayer it's like everybody just glossed over that disrespectful and talking and stuff but when they said the pledge of allegiance certainly everybody got up and they put their hand over their heart you see it's backwards everybody's giving more prevalence to the pain but the politics and the who's the president and that kind of thing and they don't care about god anymore why because they become a religious nation covering up their filth and their their hatefulness and their uh their own temperance and every ungodly thing with what appears to be religious religion is trying to cover something up you remember brother brown talked about how adam and eve when they first seen they ran into the bushes and they covered up their unbelief they tried to cover it up with fig leaves they tried to make their own little religion you know the word iniquity if you'll go examine that in the bible it actually says the crooked it comes from the greek word avon avon which means the crooked the crooked behavior and its consequences something down on the inside that's crooked and religion is trying to cover that crookedness up with a with a false covering we don't need no more religion we need something real we need something genuine when you hang around people that just all they know is their denominational covering thank god that we've got a real covering that covers us over we've got the real gospel we've got the blood of the lamb to cover us over you you examine it all down through the scriptures and you look at the life of balaam and cain and esau and judas and then ahab and they were all religious they were all trying to cover up their crookedness down on the inside the crook itself they're trying to believe but could not believe because they were just being religious brother brahman said in the unpardonable sin he said if you do those things the bible said if you love the world or the things of the world the love of god isn't even in you in other words if your heart down on the inside is not right something down on the inside of it's crooked you need something to straighten it out he said you're only just religious and never had any salvation religious is a covering but salvation is freedom salvation uncovers that's right salvation uncovered that shows what you are it shows what you really are that's what thank god for real true genuine believers who can be what they are who they don't have to cover up with if they're having a great disagreement with their spouse they can just be genuine they could just be real but i i thank god for real believers that could show their spouse what's on their phone they don't have to cover it up they could show their spouse what's in their bank account real genuine they could talk their pastor about what's on their heart they could talk to one another with real genuineness without trying to cover something up with some kind of fake religion salvation uncovers and shows what you are brother said he said that's true now because that we do things wrong is because we do not believe he said what religion is one thing religion is one thing and salvation's another religion is a covering and salvation is the gift of god you see why we don't major on religion we're not just a bunch of religious people but we've got a real genuine covering of the baptism in the holy ghost we've got to risk something real that makes us genuine praise god we've got something real the only true covering is his righteousness that's why psalm chapter 32 says i acknowledge my sin unto thee and my iniquity have no i not hid i said i'll confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin that's how you get rid of iniquity is being genuine with god that's how you get rid of sin as being genuine being real with god and saying i've done something wrong and you lay it before him and let him take care of it take it away from you he'll he'll he'll get rid of it for you he'll cover it over with his blood and that's the only true covering it's his righteousness brother ram said in the sign of the time he said wade in the balance and found wanting a christian nation rock and roll all this ungodly stuff that we're having where you waited comparing us comparing america with babylon he said they're not having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away oh they was religious they called their bishops and cardinals and all they were religious but the wrong kind of religion religion means a covering you might be covered by the baptist church presbyterian methodist pentecostal you got to be covered by the blood the blood of the lord jesus that's the original price these signs shall follow them that believe christ is here that's the kind of covering that we've got this afternoon friends no matter what kind of gloom is going through your life no matter what kind of story the devil's trying to tell you we've got a covering we've got an atonement we've got a sacrifice he said i met we're america resting upon what our forefathers did and what upon our great founders of our churches what their great sacrifice was the god which is all right and so much appreciated but we cannot draw salvation from what they did it's come to the place in our country until in the midst of the most spiritual people that we have you go to spiritual men and women that you find in their heart that there's something like now listen if you go back and listen to this sermon be certain of god and listen to the way that brother and preach this it's like he's grieving it's like the people that he thought were real genuine he began to go to them what was he finding out that something was lacking on the inside of their heart down on the inside something was still crooked something wasn't genuine and he said and the man that i thought was the colonel yet i found that they're putting emphasis upon temporal things going around and saying god gives me the biggest sow and so god that's not genuine if you look to the things of the world how much money you've got how much money you can heap up to yourself or how big your church is or all these things that are temporal he said you're bluffing you're bluffing god wants somebody to be genuine just be genuine and be real that's why young ladies just be real genuine on facebook young me and be genuine when you put your pictures on instagram if you want to attract somebody that's real and be genuine real and genuine be real and genuine out there don't be fake christian me and the ladies you don't have to advertise on facebook you don't have to advertise on something all you got to do is put yourself on display like esther did with your character your character is what a really godly man or woman wants characters what what characters what the world wants to see they're looking for something genuine just be yourself jezebel couldn't be herself she wanted to cover up her face with all that paint and makeup she threw herself flirting after yahoo and yeah he said throw her out of the window and he rolled over with his chariot why because j yahoo wanted something genuine god wants something genuine elijah wants something genuine god wants something genuine today he said sometimes faith will do great miracles and still doesn't come from a spiritual heart it's the heart that matters he said do not our lord say many will come to me that day say have not i did this and that in your name and i will confess to them depart from me you workers of iniquity because god wants to change your heart it doesn't matter how religious you are and how much you go through the religious acts and how much you go to even go to church and sit in the pew and act very religious but he wants something genuine that god can make you genuine a real genuine christian a real genuine son or daughter of god if you'll let him and he said what we need today to be spiritual let's listen to the brother brahma's recipe he said what we need today to be spiritual is a person that will humble themselves before god if they haven't got a penny and we'll pray till thy spirit within them is satisfied with the goodness of god and a revival takes place on the inside of their heart that changes their attitudes and atmosphere that they live in you realize what he's saying god what we need today to be spiritual is to realize when there's something lacking in our lives something that we we need to humble ourselves and get down with god it doesn't matter if you don't have a penny if you don't have nothing to your name but if you'll get serious with that that's why i still believe in prayer i was listening to an evangelist preaching one recently and he began to talk about how people don't believe in prayer anymore but i believe in prayer because i still believe in repentance i still believe in humbling before yourself before and almighty god i still believe in drawing yourself close to god and kneeling before him and prostrating yourself before him and saying god i need something that the world can't give me the world can't give it to me i need you to give something to me he said elijah know that a holy god could not be satisfied with modern trends of an unholy religion he said god will never be pleased outside of an entire sanctified life before him god won't be satisfied until the human soul becomes the sanctified on the altar of god consecrated for the works of god and listen he said you don't find that no more you don't find that no more isn't that why when the seven church ages were drawn out on the back of the of the church there the last church age was dark and he said i left a little bit of light but why because you don't find it no more you don't find people that are real genuine anymore even in the uh all the church world everybody's just kind of covering themselves over with little religious covering but he said god found a poor little widow woman that was pleasing to him and he found that woman in the midst of gloom and despair in the midst of darkest in the darkest hour where she had no food she had no hope all her hopes was gone all the only hope she had left was her faith in a god that's the same yesterday today and forever the bible brother brown said this gentile woman had been chosen chosen to entertain god's prophet now you think about that this little woman in the midst of all this gloom and despair in her home where she didn't have anything any fancy furniture to entertain god's prophet but that's right where god god sent his word to that little home that little home that might have been overlooked by all the big churches of the day overlooked by all the great people of the day but he said this woman must have been of the caliber of elijah now you think that that woman must have been in the caliber of elijah now you think of somebody in this day that would hear the same that hear the message of the elijah that we've heard that he's that's what he's speaking of you are of the same caliber of elijah if you're a believer sitting here tonight listening in on the on the airways because being of the believer type he said because usually your action shows what you are she had been chosen to entertain god's prophet she was a gentile a gentile not a jew and now we've got gentiles that are sitting in listening in tonight that have heard the message of elijah of our day and they are of that same kind of caliber the same caliber that elijah was god would not have called her he said if she hadn't have been a worthy one to entertain god's prophet for he would have never sent his prophet to a house that was unworthy what made her worthy i want to ask you tonight while you're listening in sit maybe sitting in your gloom praying for somebody that might be in the hospital what made her worthy is the same thing that makes you worthy to hear the message of elijah is because you are a believer she believed the word of god and your belief in the word of god we believe we believe in the bad times and the good times we believe when it's gloomy when it's dark outside we believe when it's shining light we believe because that is what we do we are the light believers he said god surely went to a believer of the same nature of elijah you see that's why the word that's why the word came to your hope that's why the word came to your home and you believed that you heard it that's why the lord is visiting your home tonight this afternoon because you're a believer you've opened up your heart you've opened up the door to your home and you said i will receive this word just like she accepted the word of the lord when it came walking by you are a believer and you have the same caliber of the elijah prophet of this day if you if you don't get nothing else out of this message you're the same caliber you're the same type you're the same we put brother ram said no doubt she'd pray night after night all night and then she begins to see that mule bearer going down down see that milward going down look at that gloom and despair you compare that tonight this afternoon with looking around and seeing people getting hooked up on ventilators and laying in the hospital and wondering seeing people dying left to right but yes maybe you you see you're looking at the mill going down down but yet she was still a believer and we're still i'm still a believer i know that god is still able god still cares about you and he said the oil was just a good spoonful left in the little container just that much oil and that much meal lay between her and death it looked like all hopes was gone excuse me you see in the midst in the midst of that gloom and despair a story was being woven a testimony was being told and now and it looks like in the mid maybe in the midst of your gloom and your despair a story is being woven a testimony you're going to come out the other side with something that you can tell others about it looked like all hopes was gone but yet god still cares he said she must have got real sincere about her prayers you let that strike your home it'll be a little more sincere than we are this morning when we know that death lays at the door and he said you know it's a strange thing may god let this soak into every one of you if you never hear me preach again this is brother branham's words he said let this be a message it's strange most strange that sometimes that god does things that way now could you imagine that that now just put that in your head that god does not raise children like we do he actually well maybe he's saying he'll sometimes he'll allow things to get real bad he'll allow people at work to to get on you he'll allow people at your church to to maybe not be for your friends or maybe not treat you the way that you expect he'll allow ministers to not get invited to preach at the places that they want to preach he'll allow things to get real gloomy and real dark to maybe the sickness to come in why because he's looking for faith reaction with faith state when you've got the good man in the house there at the door it's you've got something there that will react right to fate to to bad times to the gloominess to the darkness some faith with faith speaks it it speaks assurance it knows he said when we have confessed our sins and met every requirement that god requires we believed on god we've confessed our sins and we made all the wrongs that we have did right done everything that we know how to do every requirement that god had made or asked we have met that requirement and let yet he lays silent he just won't answer us when he's silent when it looks like he's not answering that's when faith goes to work he wants to see you believe he wants to see you say i don't care if it doesn't look like i'm getting an answer from god right now i don't care what circumstance to say but yet my faith something down on the inside is stronger than all the circumstances is holding on and he said when i went back and traced my life and turned over every stone and i'd find that i did something wrong i'd go confess it and say lord god i'll make it right and go do so he's saying what he's when he's got all the background tied it up listen to what he's saying then come back again and say now lord thou art god you'll answer me surely i met every request that you required me to do and every requirement i've met it and still he won't move seems to stop silent what are you gonna do when god doesn't answer back what are you gonna do when it looks like thing gloom is closing in i'll tell you what i'm gonna do i'm gonna believe i'm going to keep believing he said that's when you've got to be sure that he is god don't be discouraged the only thing is that in your heart to be certain of god be certain of god be know that he is god he's still the god that was the god of elijah the god of the women of zeropath the god of esther the god of daniel the god of david he's still that same god he said when we met his requirements what are his requirements we begin to think in our heart that we've got to do all these things that we've got to go through all these whatever to do like the catholics and and and confess something before a priest or push a penny with our nose or walk so many miles as penance or but he said listen when we met his requirements and what are his requirements repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that's his promise when you've met his requirements and you've repented and you've been baptized and you have met his requirements and you can come even if even if he doesn't answer immediately you can be certain of god that he'll come on the scene and fulfill his promise because he promised that he would give you the baptism of the holy ghost well what if you're sick what are his requirements he said any among you sick call the elders of the church and let them anoint and all in prayer the prayer of faith shall save the sick and god shall raise him up and you come and you do you meet god's requirement you believe you believe it and you you come and let the elders pray for you and then you just maybe it doesn't look like god's going to do anything but that's when you need to be certain of god rest with faith that's when faith will answer back and say i don't care if i don't see it i don't care if it takes like like abraham many years decades i don't care but i'm standing firm on god's promises because i know that he's the same yesterday today and forever he said that settles it confess your faults one to another and pray one for another you've met god's requirements these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they'll speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things that shall not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover that settles it while we got those promises we've got an assurance now all we have to do is just put our faith to work and be certain of god certain that he will keep his promises he's the one that said it we don't have to prove it he's the one that said it he'll prove it but we just have to believe it he said be certain first before you do anything be certain in your heart that it's god and when you've met everything that he said then you're sure that he's god that's when faith goes to work right there faith stands steady for it knows that he is and you've met every requirement you believe that he is and faith holds steady oh blessed be his name faith won't move for sure that god is in a rewarder of those that diligently seek him do you see what faith is faith does not rely on seeing something supernatural or feeling something supernatural or maybe it's maybe it doesn't even matter it doesn't rely on you being a church or a minister or laying hands on you or somebody touching you faith faith just won't move regardless it knows that god's word is true it's just trusting on what god has already said he said if you met god's requirement and in your heart you believe that he is god's only testing your faith for he loves to do that what is god's requirement what is god's only requirement for you to believe his word for you to say i believe that for you to hang on and believe no matter what the circumstances look like no matter what the gloom looks like no matter whether the hospital equipment is beeping no matter what the devil says you just hang on because you have met god's requirement you believe his word then remember if his if he is his word has to be true and if he required you to meet these circumstances and you did he's obligated to take care of his word don't back off and say oh i never got healed oh you poor weak faith when you've met his requirements that brings your faith to a showdown to a showdown and the showdown is are you going to accept god's word are you going to stand upon the promises of god's word despite what everything around you looks like be certain of god [Music] listen there is no no despair in christ when you get when the high priest would go into the holy of holies and surrounded by the shine of glory there would be no that's no place of despair no place of crying out and wondering if god is going to keep his word they're surrounded by the holy of holies it's time to be certain of god and not be moved moved by gloom and fear into a place of despair while we're running toward to and fro saying oh no oh no he said when you confess all your all your sins and promise god what you'll do if you'll let you get well and then because it don't happen you run off like a coward somewhere god can't use that there's no way for him to use you there's no way for him to answer you because he only answers by faith and then all of a sudden you go away and he can't answer but real truth faith stands there being sure that god is sure that god is be certain that he is and i believe this afternoon that with the word that we've heard with the word that's laying in our heart that we've packed in over the years now we can surely say that we are certain that he is we know that he is that he's a reveal of the secrets of the heart he's we know that he's a present help in time of need we know that his word is true he said if god asked this thing to be done to confess your sins and so forth and you've done it faith says that he is it's certain that it's going to happen your request has to be granted oh i hope you don't miss that if you're sure of god god's sure of his word i want to ask you this while you're listening in from home are you sure of god because if you're sure of god god is sure of his word he's only waiting to test you to see where you believe do you believe despite of all the gloom do you believe his word do you believe all that you've heard do you believe that promises are true do you believe he's still here he's a prison help in time of trouble do you believe the bible is for a full of stories of people heroes of the faith that went through gloomy situations the hebrew children that when they were tested in gloom and despair and they wasn't to bow to an idol because god had confidence in them they know that he was jehovah they know that he answered prayer but whether he did in their case or not it would have to be for the good so they just made their statement confess their sins and walked into death when they were going to the fiery furnace knowing that they were certain that if god let them burn up he'd raise them up again in the resurrection they were certain of god because they know that god would work everything for their good are you certain this afternoon that god will work everything for your good or were you willing to walk through the fire in the gloom of despair like they were knowing knowing they all things work together for the good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose everything is seen like sometimes things are out of cater people get sick and they can't minister people get sick or whatever things get begin to get moved and shuffled around but yet all things work together for good we've got that promise that no matter what life throws at us no matter what darts the devil can throw at us all things everything is for your good to them who are the call according to his purpose so they made one statement a hebrew children they were certain they were certain and they walked right into the fiery furnace and god let them walk there sitting looking at them setting looking at them and now he's looking at you he's looking at us this afternoon he wanted to see their reaction and he wants to see your reaction what will you do god said i'll see what they'll do about it i'll see what reaction their faith has how will they react and they reacted by saying we're not we will not bow we'll go we'll go into the fire we'll do whatever it takes because we are certain of god he said they walked right up to that fiery first furnace and right at the last moment there he'd come riding out of the heavens on a chariot of wind fan the breezes off of them while he consoled them and talked to them god let your faith come to the spot where it'll react he brings you to a place of despair and gloom where something's got to happen your faith has to take over faith begins to move god lets your faith come to the spirit where a place where to react he let them go into the fire so faith would do something so look at the story of job where he began to be accused by satan satan our accuser accused him of being a secret sinner but job know that he had not seen he know that he'd confessed everything that he'd done and put a bird offering out there that was god's requirement and he met every everything that god required he offered the bird offering he'd he sacrificed for even the secret sins of his family just perchance maybe somebody's done something that they haven't confessed maybe somebody's done something that i don't know about i'm gonna offer a sacrifice that he had done he had met everything that god required he said that's all god required was that burnt offering and a confession and job done those things satan said i'll take his camels for he's a rich man i'll take his sheep and finally he taken his children the closest to his heart but still job stood pat for he was certain he was god for he had talked to him and he met his requirements he was certain he was god even though he lost everything god took everything he allowed everything to be taken away from it until he was sitting on that ball he was scraping his bowls and he had lost everything and he brother brown said oh god when a man keeps what god said do he's certain he's god he's had to answer faith calls him on the scene every time if you've been anointed and prayed for god's waiting to see what you'll believe about it not run up next sunday and run the next day until the next healer comes through the city he's waiting to see your reaction on your faith he's looking at you tonight this afternoon warning to see what your reaction will be he said when you've done what you know was right when you've met his requirement when you confessed and made right and done restitutions and laid it before god i don't care how silent he is he's still god waiting to put that faith there you've done your works now he wants to see your faith by your works he wants to see what you'll do when you openly confess that god is the same god and you're alive your life applied in his hands to be lord i am the clay thou art the potter then ask what you will faith will never move it'll stand right there what's what's god looking for he's looking for somebody that will surrender their whole heart they will surrender their whole being and say lord i know i know you're the one that you're the one that can deliver me you're the only source of my strength job said i made my confession i put the burnt offering out before god and i'm not a sinner he know where he was standing then everything went on just on and on and on just as hard as it could go trying to down job and to bring job to a place that he would deny god and deny that burnt offering he said and job said you see so many times we look at circumstances and he even said well look at we'll look at preachers and he said don't look at the preachers in their faults and their complexes how satan likes to throw that at you why you're no better than you was when you was anointed you're no better than you was when them preachers prayed for you then preachers ain't right in the first place but he said it doesn't matter about that preacher it's your faith in the living god what mouse it's not what the preacher is it's what god is the preacher never made the promise god made the promise it's not up to the preacher it's up to god and your faith to believe that that is god so be certain of god be certain that it's god and that's god's word and god is in his word a job was certain of god and even to the place where his wife began to say thou speak she said thus thou still retain that integrity curse god and die but he said unto earth thou speak us as one of the foolish women speaketh job said thou speak us like a foolish woman he said the lord gave and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord he was certain that there was god and listen what brother said he said and when he got that out of his mouth the thunders began to roar and the lightning began to flash god moved on the scene it always calls him on the scene when you are certain of his word when you are certain that he's god he said he'll sit silent for a long time that's what he's doing he said inside look at this bunch of hail bound americans church going hypocrites he said i'm not angry but sin angers anybody that's right with god i'm not angry with the nation not angry with the people but i'm angry with the devil who has caused these things to blind the people he's angry with with the situation that the devil's got the people in where they're trying to cover themselves over with the religion he said these blind pastors and preachers let them get by with some kind of a little man-made theology you've got to be born again and god keeps his word this poor little woman she knew that he was god as that barrel went down down down circumstances got worse and worse all the time but god was letting it get that way he just loves to do that he loves to put your faith to a test to see how you act on it let you be anointed and prayed for then make you worse say come on satan put him to the test i know he believes me bless god forever put him to a test now i know he took my word for it could he say that about you daylight broke she said the little fella had cried all night for something to eat and she said what will i do with one little handful of meal could you could you think about that question now what will i do she all she had was one little handful of meal left this little widow woman of zeropath all she had was one little little handful of meal that she thought was no longer maybe didn't have the value that it used to have and he said you know that meal was christ so if you just have a little just a little meager measure of christ if you just started out with a drop a little drop of christ he said any bible student knows that christ was that meal offering and that meal offering had to be ground with a special burr too because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and the oil and then she mixed that with the oil and the oil means the spirit as we know according to ezekiel 4 and so forth that's the reason we anoint with oil it's the spirit what is it and she the father seeking such to worship him in spirit and in truth the spirit the oil and the truth that meal offering jesus was the truth he was the meal offering and this oil was the spirit and the spirit mixed with the truth has got to bring something and he said put it together now you put it together the meal the word that you've heard put it together with the spirit quickening that word put it together and it makes a cake and it makes a kid it'll make a cake something that you can live off of and then but see you put those together and there's one final ingredient to the recipe that so many people forget and that's the two sticks and he said now what's it ready for it's ready for the cross it's ready for self-sacrifice that's what you have to do if the word's been preached and you've got the spirit in it mixed together it's self-sacrifice to deny every pain to deny every sickness to deny every everything that's contrary to god's word and stand on it the doctor says this that or the other that don't make a bit of difference you stand on it because god says so the meal comes you got the oil you mix it together mix it together and put it put it on the fire with those two sticks he said in the old times they never found a better way to make a fire there's not a better way to make the holy ghost in fire there's not a better way to get the holy ghost than take the meal and the oil and put it together on this two sticks of your self-sacrifice willing to die out to your own reasoning to the only to your own way of looking at things he said if the preacher preaches the word and the man that receives it believes it and acts upon it something's got to happen if you're a sinner you'll have to be saved if you're sick you'll have to be healed because god promised it as as if promised that if we are certain of god as certain as he's god he has to keep his word certainly then the command was go to the city for i have commanded a widow woman a vision before broke before the prophet he's just obeying because when the prop when the requirement is met something will happen she looked and she saw a man standing leaning across the gate thin cheeked bearded bald-headed looking across the gate with an old piece of sheepskin wrapped around him looked like he was kind of an old looking old gentleman she said i'll share my water with him and he said he can brother ram compare that with the waters of life you're you're ready to share the gospel with anybody but you know one thing i'd like to get out of this story is that everything that happened to this little widow woman as she's she she's in the the depths of despair of gloom and she don't have nothing there and here this man comes out of the wilderness dressed dressed in sheepskin he begins to say give give me the last little bit that you've got give me your water give me your meal it begins to like make all these demands of her but yet she wasn't offended you begin to look through the scripture and find all the places where it looked like people had a right to be offended but yes she wasn't she wasn't offended naaman wasn't offended when when the prophet would not even come out to see him he just sent his little messenger to go tell him and then he told him to go dip in the water and the old muddy river jordan seven times go dip in that muddy water but yeah he wasn't offended and so many times we get offended at the word we get offended at the way that it's presented we'll get offended at the way that the minister delivers it or whatever you know there's many things that you could be offended at me maybe this afternoon you could get offended at my southern accent or the way i kind of have a heat way of expressing her maybe i skip over things or whatever there's many things to be offended in the same way that maybe that little widow woman had many things to be offended at elijah there's many ways that many things that you could be maybe offended at the pastor or at brother branham with his kentucky accent the way they his delivery but yet if you just receive it in the way that it's delivered something will happen she said just a moment sir she backs with the sticks in her hand and the voice thundered again not only do you share your water but bring me a little morsel of bread in your hand bread of life water of life was it of life she'd die as soon as that perished bring me your water and bring you bring me your bread what do we find here what lesson can we find seek ye first the kingdom of god and all his righteousness put put god first in everything that you do lay down all the little things that maybe you could be offended at lay down all your ideas when the doctor says you can't get well put his word first when when somebody says you're you're too much of a sinner or maybe you're a prostitute even brother brown said or a gambler a drunkard god's word first because god's word god's word is able to deliver though your skins be a scarlet they shall be as white as snow red like crimson they'll be white like wool put god first go bring me a little cake first all that you've got bring it to you bring it to me all that you've got are you willing to give it into his hands brother branham said my life all that i am all that i know he begins to ask himself that question all that i am i'm 50 years old are you willing william branham to lay it to me are you willing maybe tonight to this afternoon i could ask that same question are you really willing bob black to lay it to me are you willing your little children to lay your life to me are you willing to ask yourself that question to delay everything are you willing can you do it sick people can you trust me put me first bring a morsel of bread in your hand and fetch me a little water she looked at him there was something told her that that man knowed what he was talking about god knows his own there had come across the fence because she was obeying and the gloom broke thus saith the lord the barrel will not go empty or the crews run die run dry and she she his brother said she made the cake she gave it to the prophet she went back and made some for her son and herself and they eat and drank with plenty upon the earth and he asked the question where did it come from where did all that plenty come from how did it get there scientifically tell me where that meal come from where did that oil come from how did it get in that cruise you might have lost your health you might have lost your fellowship but just take him at his word be certain that he's god the gloomy times that's looking now might not look might not look so gloomy if you'll just take his work if you'll just take his word and be certain that he's god you know brother brown told that story about that he was over in germany and he saw that painting on the wall that was called the cloud land and it looked like when you when you stand way back away from it it looked real gloomy and dark but the closer you got up to it then you begin to see the angels wings beating he said when you see it off in a distance this is the horriblest looking gloom you've ever seen see that's how life looks sometimes that's how the little story of the widow woman it looked real gloomy and and even today things can look real gloomy just clouds matted together when you're looking at it from a long distance but when you get real close to it it changes it changes when you get when you close in on it because you realize that god's actually he's molding your character he's doing something for your good all these things are for your good to mold you into the image of what he wants you to be to match you up with his word he's molding you and he's he's he's testing your faith he wants to see faith reaction he said when you get real close to it it changes its angels wings beating together singing hallelujahs to the lord so that's what gloom is sometimes if you look at it at a long distance it looks gloomy and dark but take god at his word and be certain that he's god and move up close to it move up close to his word move up close to god's promises and you'll find out it's just angels wings of beating together he said she was somewhat like abraham was called on to give everything she had and lay it on the altar of sacrifice and maybe you're called like that this afternoon to give up your ways give up your unbelief and give up everything you've got and then take the oil and the word and mix it together take take the take god's promises and mix it up with the quickening spirit of of his power and put it on the altar of self-sacrifice and you'll find out it'll call god on the scene as certain as i'm standing in this pulpit brother brown said he said if you have a need if you're sick and the doctor says you can't get well and you ca and you promise god that you'll serve him all the days of your life and you're certain that he's god come meet his requirement what's god's requirement to believe his word to surrender the situation over to him to surrender to him to surrender everything to surrender your will to him knowing that all things are working out for your good he said if there's a backslider that's certain that you're a god and they've wandered away may they come today because you said though your sins be a scarlet they shall be white like snow red light crimson they'll be white like wool if there's who are sick may they realize that you're god you keep your word you must keep your word and as they lay their self with their all the spirit that's in them that's confessing they believe and then also with the word the bread of life that went forth christ ground up to them in the old testament and in the new testament to show that he's the same yesterday today and forever may they mix that or that word with the oil spirit that they've got then stand to their feet at the altar saying this is all i got lord i bring it what other requirement could there be this afternoon this is all we got all we've got is to believe god's word if you'll just bring that to the altar this afternoon bring it to the altar of your heart and say all i've got is i believe your word this is all i got and i bring it he said i got a child that obeyed me i put him through the test and he proves that he loves me and he believes me he's certain that i am for it is said he that cometh to god must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him no matter how gloomy it looks you say well it might look like i'm still sick that doesn't it's just angels wings gather together that's always god in a form of blessing it looks gloomy to you but draw a little closer to it and look again see if it ain't god standing there keeping his word let's stand to our feet here in the building here and those of us that are here and those of you at home if you'll just stand to your feet it might look gloomy outside it might look gloomy in the circumstance that you're in but it's just god standing there keeping his word he's standing there he's standing there observing to see whether you'll be certain that he is still god maybe this afternoon if you just raise your hand if you're certain of god there at your home there there wherever you are if you're still certain that he's god if you lift up your hand as a sign to him as we go to prayer now before we close the service lord god we can't see the hands raised now lord but lord you know the secrets of all men's hearts you know every need lord god you know every every maybe gloomy oppressed heart lord god that's raising their hands up to you because they're in need of something lord jesus and lord i i pray lord that you'll look upon these hearts lord that are be that are certain that you are still god despite all the circumstances but despite all the things that we can look at today and maybe look at with despair and looks like hopelessness like that little widow of xeropath like like naaman there dying in his sickness like like so many others in the old testament that we could point to but yet you're still god you're the same yesterday today and forever and we lift up our hands lord knowing that you're still the same knowing that we are certain of you lord god we know that you are still the same yesterday today and forever whatever i need is this afternoon lord god we're claiming your promises we're laying the promises before you lord because we're certain lord god that you're still able to heal and deliver and to save lord god and to keep us lord jesus lord i pray lord that you'll surround about
