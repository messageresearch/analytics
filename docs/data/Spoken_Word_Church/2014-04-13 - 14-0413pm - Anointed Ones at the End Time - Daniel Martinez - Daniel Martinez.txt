TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you can be seated uh sister Peggy has one and she'll she'll be next we was going to let her go first but i' like to tell you what happened the night brother Bob was preaching uh I had stopped down coming upstairs brother Danny was standing down there and I was telling him but I hadn't been sleeping for weeks I'm talking about I ain't sleeping I count every hour I can count it I had got to where I just couldn't go I tell the Lord if you don't do something I'm through I I said I can't preach I said I can't I doubt if I'm even going to be able to leave the house if you don't do so I just S I tell I just told him this a little bit but it done something and and I'm I'm going tell you this I'm going to tell you a little story here that I believe I'm sorry I don't want to take too much time but this is what God wants I said there at the end of the service and and the praying and all was going on and brother Danny God inspired him he because he got desperate because of what he heard me say and he knows me he knows what I was going through which not only him but he was the one I was talking and he's one God chose to do this he come up here to get a prayer cloth for me I unb kny to me and he come and when every everything was through we was going out and he and I most of the last one that walks out he said I got something for you he had a prayer CLA I said praise the Lord I said I appreciate that brother I think I go home and go to bed cuz I mean we talking about not sleeping if you I got extreme sleep happeny they had just diagnosed me with so when we went out downstairs right there last thing I told him I said I'm going home and go to bed I didn't't slept in I ain't slept in weeks I mean I if if you know anything about that you know what I'm talking about I mean you can get you can die you die from it when I went home I went there and S hung around a little bit went there and get that bed slep 8 hours I slept like a baby and I and and I've been sleeping ever since he it feel good well what I wanted to say was I don't know how many of y'all know it but this morning when Brother Sam mentioned about five or six people or things being raised from the dead I was one of those and I wanted to share that with you because Dean had give his testimony because he prayed over me and I come back to this world that's right but what I wanted to do was give my own testimony and tell you and show you how the devil just can slip up you when everything is going great I was at my father's I was cooking soup for him I was bagging it up I was standing there in the kitchen had one of the best felt the best that I felt and I don't know when because I've had a lot of health problems in the last year or two and I was standing there and I was bagging up the soup you know and feeling real good and all of a sudden I felt this little drip on my nose and I thought hm I better stop here that's going to go in the soup I better stop and do something about this I just assumed it was sinus well I looked at it on my hand cuz you know how you'll do that and I looked down and it was blood on my hand and uh so it it kept dripping and I finally had you know I had to had to quit that and I went in there and Dean we have a place down where my father lives at and he was over in our camper and I've had nose beds all my life you know problems and uh so I went in there and I you know done all the laying down and that stuff and I was laying on the sofa with a little ice thing on my nose and I called Dean over at the camper and I said hey I'm laying here with a nose bleed I had had one of these in a long time I just thought I'd update you what I'm doing you know still everything was was fine I thought so I laid there a little while and it wouldn't stop so Dean come over there and he said well maybe you better call the doctor so I call the doctor and ask them what should I do and they give you the same old thing you I'll hold you your head back and do this and count to 10 and all this stuff and if it doesn't work then you know maybe you ought to go to the emergency room well i' done that for about 15 or 20 minutes trying to get it to stop it wouldn't stop it was just flowing not real bad but enough that you know I couldn't get it it wouldn't stop so Dean said well we better go on home then and we'll go by Athens Regional and my father lives about what's it about 40 miles I guess to Athens Regional well well forun well we thought about going to Watkinsville because it's an urgent care in Watkinsville so we were going through Greensboro which was about 12 miles from my father's house and fortunately they have a hospital there well about we're about 45 miles up the road and my nose was bleeding so it was clotting it was within two or three miles of the hospital I just had blood everywhere and it was just choking me I could I couldn't breathe it was choking me so and I told Dean I said Dean I don't think I'm gonna make it to Athens he said I know he said we're going to Greensboro to the hospital so we got to greensbor got in there the doctors tried to stop it they put a balloon up in my head and blew it up and um then they had me walk around a little bit say if it had stopped well I thought it stopped and then that we were washing me up cuz I had blood all over me so they were washing me up and as I I was washing it broke loose again started bleeding again just gushing and the doctor said well you know the balloon will probably hold it till you get to Athens but you really need to see an ENT said you need to go on to Athens so we went to Athens well by the time we got to Athens it had slowed down we went to the emergency room there and the doctor said well I don't want to disturb it because maybe it's sealed off now whatever is going on so they told me to go on home if it started up again come back well we went home about I guess it's about 1 or 2:00 in the morning I woke up got up to go to the bathroom while I was in the bathroom it broke loose big time all over again just gushing so Dean you know gets up and we go head back to Athens Regional we get to Athens Regional they take me in they take that balloon out of my head then they put two in there up in there and they put one up in here all the way weon there and then another one and they inflate them separately and they inflated it so bad that they thought it had damaged my head that my nose would never be normal again they had to blow it up so and uh so anyway by that time it was like 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning and they wanted me to see an ENT not just the emergency room doctor so they made arrangements for us to leave the hospital go across the street to an ENT so we got over there and he didn't want to of course disturb those two balloons but he was real concerned about them inflating them so large it was still seeping blood but it had stopped enough that he did not want to bother him so anyway when he finished examining me then we were walking out which was only maybe as far from here not even to the double doors back there and uh I was standing there and I told Dean I said Dean I said I feel strange I said I'm going to lean up here against the wall wall for a moment last thing I remember and I went out and he caught me before I hit the floor and as I was there on the floor I remember nothing except when I woke up I don't know exactly how long I was out um but it's just like a space in time now I don't remember anything about that I remember when I woke up and first thing I saw was Dean he was standing there and um then they the doctor had called an ambulance and Dean it said that the doctor was trying to get a pulse in my neck that he was screaming and holler called the EMTs but I know that I had left this world I have that space and I I I don't remember anything about it but I remember waking up and opening up my eyes and I saw my beloved one there standing over me and he prayed over me and I truly believe that's why I'm here today because he he took initiative and he said Lord he knew that that was the only help that we had and he went to the Lord for me and that's why I'm here today I'm sorry uh I just felt like I'll make this quick I was one of the other people that had been raised from the dead that's right uh as y'all know uh had some heart issues in my life one night I got up and I walked in the bathroom it 2:30 in the morning and the last thing I remembered was I was trying to breathe and it felt like somebody grabbed my heart when it contracted and locked it and it wouldn't wouldn't open back up and the last thing I remembered I was trying to take breath in but it was being driven out of me and I just H and that's the last thing I remembered and I'd always thought that maybe I'd have a heart attack one day and I said well if I did when I go down I'd try like a cattle with a stun gun I just went out busted my lip open on the vanity in the bathroom that's the last thing and it felt like when that locked up it felt like something shot up and blew the top of my head off I'm convinced my heart was locked and it wasn't beaten amen that's right Margaret my wife heard it and she came into the bathroom she said she called to me she said no motion she reached down rolled me back rolled me over she said whes on my eyes I saw she could see my pupils were rolled up in my head and she said Gary nothing and she said she wrapped her arms around me and said Lord Jesus help him and she said Gary my eyes roll back in my head I set up and went what happened I'm convinced I was one of those that's been raised from the so I'm here because of that thank you that's all stand no that's fine no that's F we appreciate the Lord ain't God good yeah he's done many many things for us all

we'll change the order of service I'll ask Brother Sam he'll come Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord we got one more testimony where you at sister Anna well you know I've just waited too long to come up and praise the Lord for what he's done for me but one thing I'm sure of right now if I don't testify I may not be here next week okay because of the goodness of God that he brought me through this problem with my heart to start with and never knowing anything was really wrong and to me I'm just a person that just goes right at things a mile a minute and say forget it I'm going I'm doing this I'm doing this I'm doing this but anyway it came to where I I didn't have much strength I didn't have much energy and I knew something was wrong but I came to brother Dale and I told him I said Brother Sam they're trying to tell me something's wrong with my heart and I said I don't believe it I said I just don't believe it so when I went in and they did the caiz I expected them to maybe put a stint in send me home well when I got there they said you're not going anywhere so I needed a triple bypass um anyway I said well I was on drugs anyway I didn't know what what I was telling them anyway but I went ahead and had it done so when I come out and I was in ICU I'm going to tell you what all I can tell you people is the wonderful goodness of God because I didn't have to come out of that you know God could have just took me on with him right then and there but he didn't and I came into that ICU the most wonderfullest people there to take care of me when I got into the room it w it was all so funny in a lot of respects because I was drugged up and you know you know tell them what you say and what you do you know um and I lose my thoughts when I want to say something and that that's one bad thing but God has just been so good that he would bring me out of that but I do remember this one thing they had to give me a a unit of blood and so I was sitting up in the chair before when they were trying to warm it up and get it ready and I sat there and I told the little girl I said let me have that before you hook it up and put it in me and so I took it and I was rubbing it in my hands and I said father God I just plead the blood of Jesus over this Blood I said if there's anything there wrong with it Lord I said you just cleanse it before it comes into me and then she took it and put it back up on the rack and put it in me and I said I do remember that very plainly and I think how wonderful the Lord was to I I can't put into words you know what it is I felt or how he brought me through that but how wonderful and you know everyone that I talked to they talk about said you don't even look like you've had anything wrong with you I was going through the place smiling Becca took a picture of me in in front of the heart place and they said goodness what were you doing in there so it's just God took care of all of it and I want to give him the praise the honor and the glory for it and I love my brothers and sisters and I know y'all pray diligently for me and I thank you my pastor amen amen amen amen thank you Lord amen God is still God sir he's always God

amen uh I pray that uh God will richly bless you from you know but uh I want to just uh let's get over into the word of God because I know that that's what we're all here for let's bow our heads in prayer Our dear and precious Lord we come before you Lord God recognizing Lord Jesus that Lord It's Fallen my lot Lord God to speak to your people once again Lord God I pray oh Lord Jesus that you just take me aside Lord God and speak to your people what they have need of Lord God hearing those testimonies Lord God I recognize Lord Jesus you're doing your work here amongst the people Lord God it's an Evidence Lord God that Lord we recognize your presence here Lord Jesus and Lord we can come Lord God recognizing Lord God that you are able Lord God to take a person like myself out of the way and use these lips of clay Lord God to bring what you've put in my Heart Lord Jesus to your people Lord God Lord bless you bless each and every one of us Lord God as we've all come to hear from you Lord in Jesus Christ's name I pray amen amen I want to turn over to uh uh Matthew the 24th chapter the 15th through the 18th verse amen and I want to speak a little bit about uh the sermon brother bam preached called the anointed ones at the end time but you know I want to take it in a little different avenue he talked about the anointed ones at the end time and he really emphasized how the denominations in the world has has gotten anointed to take the people away from the word but I recognize that in that title anointed ones at the end time there are true anointed Glory and the true anointed is the bride of Christ that'll come into His into his presence and that'll become Anointed with his Spirit Anointed with the Holy Ghost which we all claim we got and then produce exactly that book of Acts that that was to come after the first anointing of that holy spirit amen so we want to talk about these things and I recognize that uh that uh uh I just been hearing those testimonies he's doing that amen he's just doing that for us amen we're so grateful amen Matthew 24 15th verse onto the uh 28th verse then ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet standing in the Holy place whosoever readeth let him understand now I don't know brother has been to Israel right and you saw the mosque of Omar there and all that so that's that's there right now amen uh hasn't been taken down uh Temple has not been rebuilt but we recognize that we're at the season and the time when the gospel will go back to the Jews and this gen spile dispensation will be over but it's over as the bride is returned back to into the presence of almighty God or into the wedding suppers amen and that's when the bride has made herself ready we're here we're here in that we can say this day those scriptures are being fulfilled amen so let let let us okay the 16th verse then let let them which are in Judea flee unto the mountains now we remember that this was when Rome took over Jerusalem let them which are in J in Judea flee into the mountains let them which are on the hill housetops come not down to take the things out of the H out of his house neither let them which which is in the field uh return back to take the his his clothes and who and woe unto them that are with ch child and them that which give suck in those days but pray that ye your flight be not in the winter neither in the Sabbath day for then shall Great Tribulation such as such was not since the beginning of the beginning of the world till this time nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there shall be no flesh saved but for the elect sake those days shall be shortened remember that's when Titus took over Jerusalem and that has uh that that that that's a a bygone time an event that has happened back in the past but now we move on to uh uh the rest of the of the scripture there now we're looking at Matthew 24 to the 28th verse Okay then if if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there or there believe it not for there shall be false Christ and false prophets and they shall shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they should deceive the very elect Belo uh behold I have told you before wherefore if ye say unto if they say unto you he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in a secret chamber believe it not for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be for whosoever wheresoever the carcass is there shall the Eagles be gathered together amen now we realize you can be be seated we realize as we look at the at the anointed ones here that he's talking about at the end time and they're telling you uh may call you to go out to the Wilderness to follow a message or a Ministry while like Jimmy Jones maybe uh was telling his people or to go out to Guyana or or like the others who who might say well he's in this secret Chambers or or come to our church he's only in here you know nobody else has got him they're trying to tell you you know if you recognize the word of God tells you that uh Christ doesn't isn't going to present himself in that way he's going to present himself out in the open like the lightning shineth from the East and goes over to the West it's not done in secret right you know uh if you start looking at the message of hour it was not done in secret amen exactly uh presidents and and and and and and and and and great men knew about the knew about the moving of this word of God but we caught up in our denominations never knew it really happened never knew that God's presence has come on the scene and in our day and age I was what uh maybe let's see I was born in 57 so I had a few years that brother Brandon was on the scene you know during my my lifetime and yet most of us never really were in those meetings we were never seeing the presence of the Holy Ghost du The Works he was doing you know when uh when I I was I I I've been uh going through all the prayer lines and as I'm listening through the prayer lines I'm seeing brother brandham speak to somebody and tell them about the secrets and intenses of their heart and speaking the very details of how their sickness has come about how it's going to and how it's going to go away when the Holy Spirit comes by to tell him and then he turns around and says did did I whatever I said was it true you know he didn't even remember what he just finished saying and you start to wonder well what is it and then I I recognize it was Jesus Christ using his lips using his thinking to say the things he was saying to where he couldn't even remember what was being said right so you start to recognize then is wh what are we saying that brother Brandon was an anointed one in this end time but now uh can we say that that's the the only thing there is can we say that's the only message that's been brought in our day and age that that only brother brandham had the Holy Ghost like that or does it come to a time when he said that we're supposed to have the very same spirit that raised Christ Jes like the song you're just saying that raised Christ Jesus from the dead dwells in you when it dwells in you it'll Quicken your mortal bodies but not only that it'll use your body to identify to a Dying World of a living Christ The Living Christ that lives in you and the living Christ is still still doing his work in this day and age right amen so when we start to look at the anointed the anointed ones at the end time of course we know of the false teachers we know of the what the denomination has tried to portray and present to you and they're coming to A place where there like like brother uh Dale was mentioning where they will show signs and wonders where they will receive power you say holy ghost power they'll Channel holy ghost power to do miracles to present to you a false Doctrine and the anointed ones at the end time that's what they've done throughout all ages jambers and jambers weren't throwing out those snakes under witchcraft they were using the power of God Amen they were producing the very same things Moses was doing but under a false teaching right right amen balum balum came by he was okay uh uh giving the right sacrifices the right the the the the right the the uh clean clean sacri IES the right he was doing they were doing everything according to the word of God to present a false teaching and and and knowing the underlying things about this message about the message of Moses about the message of coming from the of The Exodus knowing the very right things and knowing what the people were called to he teaches baac yeah to this is how you'll defeat Israel he taught them look just get your women to go out with them men right exactly get intermingle the world into your into your into your into the church into the into the called out ones intermingle the world into it and you'll defeat them and they did and they did so where are we standing in this day and age if we want to intermingle the world into what we know as a message of this hour we'll find the same problems we'll start to lack in our faith the way they lacked in their faith you know uh uh uh we we recognize that that that ever since since the days of Noah or or before the days of Noah when the sons of God saw that the that the that the world was fair the daughters of of man were fair that was that was what it what it was intermingling and getting in getting in amongst unbelieving starting to unbelieve yourself you know the brother said go go look at that believe the sign you know uh you know I I looked a little bit of it and I said I wouldn't waste my time that's right I wouldn't waste my time listening to what they got to say about what I know is a Vindicated prophet of God of this hour cuz they don't got nothing nothing to say I mean they wouldn't say it to his face cuz the angel of God was standing right there Chicago look at what Chicago was in Chicago when when when when when when the prophet of God stood there and says you had it out for me you guys want to call me out on the Trinity on these things he says now bring your Bible and stand right here and disprove what God has revealed this the serpent seed and all this show br your Bible and stand right here and and try and dispute or disprove anything that I've said that is right in the word of God not one of them got up why because they knew for a fact that the angel of the Lord was standing there and he'd have smot them dead see so where is it we're looking at a day and age when they dare to speak now they dared to call brother brandham I mean they dared to to come back and say that he had a lustful spirit over Marilyn Monro and when when when when you recognize you recognize that almighty God was working in the message of this hour vindicating the word of God for this hour to bring a bride to a rapturing faith right and you want to just disprove any of the things that God has said in this day and age to bring you there if you're going to believe that stuff well you know they're going to they're going you may as well well go join the Catholics that's correct amen it's the same am I mean uh uh I mean you can just go ahead and go go to any Dogma so what is it anointed anointed ones at the end time falsely anointed what are we looking at what's coming look at what what what's coming on the scene now coming on the scene we recognize that is there has to be a falling away before the coming of the Lord and it's not a I mean if if if we look at a fall way we're not going to all if if if anybody's going to fall away from this message it's not to go join the denominations the denominations don't have anything right but to lose faith in the very God that's doing the work in your day and hour would or or or let you just lean over a little bit towards the world and the things of the world rather than staying with the truth what God's revealing to you in your day amen recognizing that hey now maybe I can't have faith you know maybe I maybe I can I'll have to go the way of the doctors and believe that the Cancer's going to overtake me you know lose the faith right see this message to bring back the faith that was once delivered to the Saints what's the faith that was once delivered to S go to to Hebrews 11 right I mean Hebrews 11 the whole thing excuse me in Hebrews 11 the whole thing it's goes to telling you what people were built out of in those days what they suffered in those days to stand for God's word for their hour for your hour what are you standing for amen and and what what is this what do we look at signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they would deceive the very elect Matthew 5 uh uh 4-7 I mean four four and five Matthew 4 5 four and five I think it is amen Matthew 5 oh excuse me 4 4 Matthew 5:45 that ye may that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he for he maketh the son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth the rain on the just and the unjust now when when the rain when the when now now look when we when we look at the rain coming we look at we look at at at at that Vision that brother brandham had at the at the um at The Greens Mill and there at The Greens Mill he turned over he turned over to to the scripture in in Hebrews where this where the rain cometh on the just and the unjust and he sees cuz he had that question of how is it that there's a man filled with the Holy Ghost that's committing adultery yeah and and and and and still prophesying and prophesying truth and there's a man that is truly filled with the holy ghost prophesying from the Holy Ghost and interpreting and tongues tongues interpreting back and forth and and and it being Vindicated he could tell by his his his by by by what God had given him as a gift he could tell it was a true prophecy and he says well how how is it that this man he says I thought I was amongst and then I start thinking I'm amongst Devils because the the man had a had had the wrong kind of life right and this scripture came up and said it it it comes it's it's the power of the Holy Ghost comes down to anoint in an age in a day and age and it'll anoint the good and the evil now you see why are the people that are preaching these falsehoods getting such a following that's right because there's a certain time because there's a certain season as the Bride Comes to a rapturing faith as the brides coming to the point where they got to uh H uh maybe maybe they'll go to the uh you could say I've been having a few dreams and they've been bothering me pretty much because I've been dreaming that I'm I'm I'm in Hitler's concentration camps and I'm fearing for my wife fearing for her good and realizing that and and then as I'm going through this and and and they're they're they're they're like um I don't know what they're doing they're like unloading Us From a Train sending us into into something or or or or or or or into into a gas chamber or something and I'm saying well I I'm I'm fearing for her she's gotten pulled away from me I'm fearing for her and then something comes rising up in me and says this bride of this day and age won't go down like the first one they won't go to the Lion's dence like the first ones say they'll take their stand for the word of God for their day and they'll believe by faith and then I started saying those bullets have no power over me I started I started I say th those those you know these these soldiers have no power over me and just as I was saying that I woke up from the dream I said my gosh what I fear and then I started realizing you know what we're in a day and age you guys all saw the uh or or have heard that the pope is already trying to preach or coming in to on a video to Pentecostal people right oh yeah right can't remember what the name of that Minister was but okay he's he's trying to gather in Gather in his interest was John Paul Pope John Paul two popes before had a vastedge all the denominations this second one had the same interest and he came and apologized to All America for what the priests had done to the to to people and all this stuff and he said then the Catholic Church will recompense and oh everybody was so happy about that now this one's coming in to the Pentecostal churches and saying we're all one we've all made mistakes in our past but we're all under God and we're all one and the people are just swallowing Hook Line and Sinker why because there's they have no word of God showing what the real underlying right reasoning for the whole thing is right and they they they say oh oh everybody says oh sure you're welcome here we're welcome there and on on and on well you know where it's coming from because it's it's come time has come time for the Beast to exercise her power right and gain the confidence of the false prophet that's correct and then after the false prophet well he's going to have the power that the Beast had in the original to put the pressure on the true bride of Christ or the false or or even the the what is called The Remnant right that that will be here as we look at the Book of Revelation so we're standing here and we look so where I just went to the scripture where was I uh Matthew 5 okay now let's go over to uh Hebrews 6 1-8 Hebrews 6 1-8 hallelujah how many appreciate the Lord yes sir amen how many believe that we're standing in a day and hour that this bride will prove that well this bride will will find herself ready amen we're looking at a day and hour uh Hebrews 6 1-8 okay therefore leaving the principles of the doctrines of of the doctrine of Christ remember it says Doctrine not doctrines doctrine of Christ not christs the doctrine of Christ letting let us go unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance rep and and uh repentance from wait Foundation of repentance of from dead works and and of Faith towards God for the of the doctrines of baptism and of laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment and all all these things we will we we do for God if God permits for for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift not gifts of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and having uh having taste tasted of the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they were to fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame for the Earth which drinketh up the rain and cometh upon the rain that cometh upon it and beareth forth herbs meat for them who for whom it was dressed receive a blessing of God but for them which beareth thorns and and Briars is rejected and nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned so whose end is to be burned but beloved we are not we are persuaded that that we are persuaded better things for you and the things that are um accompanied y accompanied salvations through through though we thus speak though we thus speak so we recognize that those you know almighty God has brought us to a place where as the word of God has been administered and the Holy Spirit has been freely given to the bride of Christ for this day and age to whoever wants the Holy Ghost has an opportunity to go before God and ask him and he'll give him the Holy Ghost to turn away to to turn away from what God's revealed in this day and hour the truth that God's given to our to us as as Believers would cause us to just uh uh we we we we it's it's it's like the like like if God's watering and watering and watering the garden and all it wants to do is produce thorns and thistles why would he take the time to dress the garden anymore he'll turn around and set it a fire amen and start start all over again repow it Whatever It Takes no reason no reason to work so hard on it and it's comes the same thing when God has spoken to us us of this Vindicated truth that God's given us in this day and age when he's he's he's he's he he he raises the Sun up brings the water in he the and and only the weeds want to grow and what he's trying to dress the herbs don't have don't want to don't want to produce they don't want to produce fruit worthy of repentance where's what's happening says you know you know when I was looking at the at the looking at what what what what it took what does it take for example something has to die so we can live right you know some of us say well I'm going to become a vegetarian I'm just I'm just not going to eat no more no more animals cuz I love animals so much I'm just not going to eat animals but that fruit has to die that that that that that herb has to die for you to live so you say well I'll become a vegan I won't eat any animal products I won't eat eat any any any milk I won't eat any any Meats I won't eat nothing like that still you have to eat something or you'll die so what what do we look looking at we're looking at in spiritually the Lord had to give his life amen to send down his holy spirit to come and anoint the bride of Christ for this day and hour to bring her to a place he's not doing it in vain he wants to bring your faith up to receive what he's promised for your day and hour for the bride has made herself ready what are we looking at the anointed ones we're anointed Ed for an hour and an hour's come upon us there's an hour that's come upon us that's to bring us to a revealed word for this hour to bring you to a rapturing faith to bring you to a place where you'll say look I I I can't just sit around and and and take everything the devil's trying to throw at me right right I'm going to take God's word and I'm going to believe God's word I'm going to take him at his word because he said it not me he said he gave me that promise I can believe that promise because I I've come to the place where I know who I am I know I'm the anointed one for this hour to receive his Holy Spirit and believe him and take him at his word amen well we we know that you know as jambers and jambers withstood Moses we know that that that that they they they they came against the true Vindicated ones for the power let's go over to Hebrews I got to Hebrews the 11th chapter and let's start at the first verse because I'm just going to touch at the first verse and then go to the last verse on Hebrews 11 okay for faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we we understand that the worlds were formed by the word of God so that things which are seen were made of things which do not appear right Y what do you mean God made all these all that we know of everything that's in existence that man has been able to peer into space and see everything that's vastly out there you know they were showing the one of the satellites we work on satellite on on uh nuclear we work on nuclear fuels and in these nuclear fuels we have to put these little things heat sources and stuff on these satellites that are going to go way out of the atmosphere okay uh and you can look them up uh it's uh uh on those satellites that are going to take pictures of Saturn and so forth like that uh I think that was called uh I can't remember the name of the of Cassini the Cassini robot the Cassini uh uh the Cassini uh Mission we I I was there building uh putting together or sending off all these heat sources and we we actually compiled up and made generators out of nuclear fuel to go up there and it gets way away from the Sun so they can't use solar power to to power these satellites but they told it as it was dying out there in space it was getting way away past Pluto past the last last uh Stars they told it to turn its cameras and take its last picture of Earth and it turned around and it saw where Earth should be and took a picture of it and it was just a little speck in a huge beam of sunlight way out there in space and it just kind of makes you realize how small we really are exactly but then when you start looking at the vastness of everything there is this scripture here tells you it was all made of something that's not there he didn't start with anything it's not like you all sisters making a baking a cake where you have to start with flour and and add some re add some the different things to bake a cake and make it come out the way it did no he started with nothing it was all through faith he produced produced it all out there GL he produced everything there is amen all through faith and then it goes on if you read Hebrews it tells you that Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice Enoch walked with God and went off with God Noah while he built the ark and he he did it through faith because God had revealed to him Abraham stood there and he took God's word and and received the promised son you look at Isaac that he he he he he lived with the Patriarchs and all that and and did the things he did all through a call of God you look at Moses how he brought the children out in The Exodus and all all through a call of God you look at at at at all of Israel uh and and and and of course you speak of Rahab and and all the the fathers of the faith and then we go to the end of the chapter Faith chapter and this is what I want to refer to yeah one little place in this scripture that really triggers me because we're looking at fathers of the faith whom the world was not worthy of and they and these having not and these having not obtained having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise for God having provided some better things for us God having provided some better things for us that they all these fathers of the faith brother brandom laying in the grave right now they amen without us yes sir should not be made perfect you got a calling here you got a purpose here you've got to come to a place you got you've got to stand on what God has revealed in this day and age to stand by faith and produce something produce something you know I was looking at the call of Moses his calling and and I was reading through it you know kind of like you know how you can take a scripture and let's go down into Exodus I want I'm getting way off my my subject but it it it it it kind of triggers me because it's interesting thing how let's go to Exodus and it's an interesting thing how Moses was getting Called Moses was standing before the burning bush and God was talking to him and it kind of triggers that hey just as God is calling Moses he's calling me so okay uh Moses the little uh subtitle that says Moses before the burning bush uh and it's in uh Exodus the 3rd Chapter okay in the uh the midst of the burning bush Okay okay this is the way God's talking to Moses on the sixth verse Exodus 3:6 moreover he said I now this is God speaking the word I a personal pronoun I am the god of your fathers okay and then he mentions who is uh of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob Moses hid his face from God and then and then the Lord continues saying I have I have surely seen the afflictions of my people I know then we drop down to the seventh verse middle of seventh verse I know their sorrows I am come down to deliver them this is the eighth verse uh the ninth verse he says I have also seen the oppression wherein the Egyptians oppressed them the 10th verse I will send and I will send thee okay so God saying I see the afflictions I've seen what they I remember my promises I do all these things but now now I'm sending you amen you know what it's the same thing God is sending you now the message has Glory been put down already it's on magnetic tapes Hebrews I mean excuse me uh uh uh the uh Revelations 10 said that in the day of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin with to sound the mysteries of God should be finished it's been put down on Magnetic Tape Brethren it's already on tape Glory it's record now Glory now it becomes time for the record to become in you it becomes alive in you it becomes that the God that was with Moses the God that was with brother brandom now the holy spirit is in you and it has to produce it has to produce it's no longer it's it's no longer I I remember these things I remember what I've done I've seen their oppression I've seen what they're doing but now I'm sending you right amen what's he sending you to do what am I going to do I'm just a a lay member I this is about the only place I ever preach brother I'm just a lan member really so it it's okay all right but he's calling you to something he's calling you to be a people of Faith don't make the mistake and just involve yourself in the world it's it's it's like that it's like that that that call that uh uh um what do they call it the warning that that conscience that God's placed in there right you you're you're you're watching a something you shouldn't be watching something inside you says no no turn it off let's let go go back to prayer go back to the word stay in the truth stay where you should be it's not good for you amen the conscience something God's calling you there's something more for you here you're you're being called to a higher calling amen that's because the word of God is calling you to be the faith to to fulfill the word of God of the faith that was once delivered to the Saints that's your calling you're the ones to get the faith that was once delivered to the Saints you're going to be the Peter that says I'll Stand believe by faith because it's been revealed to me what was it in Peter they says who does man say that I am Jesus says Peter says everybody answers everybody all the all the other disciples answer then he turns around and says wait a minute you guys are repeated hearsay I want to say you're the Christ of God you're the deliverer you're the one coming into the world you're the one that we're waiting for and Jesus says Flesh and Blood didn't reveal this to you Peter listen nobody gave you this message something came in your heart to receive what God's given in this day and hour I would still be over there in the Catholic Church someplace right right if God didn't reveal to me this truth amen amen off an old real toore tape that wouldn't even play right we had to stick a pocket knife on it to make it re make make it speak amen but you know what there's something on that Magnetic Tape got me to stand up that morning
