year but we're gonna be praying that you make it next year no really amen so uh amen you may be seated for just a while just some of the things I would like to express before I go to the preaching of the word first I would like to take to thank butter bonnet if he's here now because he has donated the money towards motorcycles that we are now using to reach distant places in the Philippines one of them went to some ballast and the other motorcycle went to allowing and two evangelists are now using it to bring them this gospel to the faraway places we want to express our appreciation for but about it and also to the whole church here I already thanked but a bit Dale for being involved in missions in the Philippines in a great way we we appreciate your support and your love for us amen also we want you to be in impair for us because tomorrow we're gonna be heading west to Arizona to visit couple churches there and also to have fellowship with some friends from the Philippines and then we would proceed to Oregon the to minister to a church there in Oregon and then we will be back door billing in this area for the route meetings the first week of August and hopefully we will have some more time to fellowship be together and we bring greetings from our church in Thai Thai and also other churches in Metro Manila that are in fellowship together okay today I just thought of presenting something that in my humble understanding simple way of assessing the mess aids Lord meaning I'd be able to communicate this to the brothers and sisters you know I'm not the dynamic picture but I love the word you know and I prepared a a PowerPoint presentation to assist me in doing this I'm going to speak on the subject which I call covenant of perfection see God he likes to make covenant with his people he made a covenant with Adam he said if you do this I will do this you obey my word I will bless you reject my word disobey my word then curse will come and God has always been faithful to his covenant but man has always failed you Adam fail and then Noah failed again because God said if you do this then I'll do this but then he made an unconditional covenant with Abraham and that's what we're gonna talk about this morning the Covenant of perfection God made a covenant with his people so that they can all come to perfection amen and when he made the covenant to Abraham it was no longer if you do this I'll do this it was settled forever there was no condition he said I'm gonna bless you period hallelujah the subtitle of this sermon is called perfect Liberty in the perfect will of God hallelujah let me show this slide slides of the Statue of a perfect man okay we're all familiar with the with this diagram that Batman made of the statue of a perfect man really this is the fullness of Christ the structure of a perfect man is is the measure of Christ these are all attributes of Christ amen and we'll go to the our scriptures in Genesis chapter 12 verse 2 and 3 were God made the covenant with Abraham and if you would please stand with me as we read the word of God verse two says and I will make of thee a great nation remember no conditions I will make of thee a great nation I will bless thee and make mine make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed this is not just a blessing to Abraham but is also a blessing to his seed so God made a covenant to Abraham and his seed let us all pray Heavenly Father we come humbly before your feet this morning because our human understanding are limited and we cannot there's no way we can grasp the spiritual meanings of this scriptures that be of bread this morning unless you come down and help us we pray father that the Holy Ghost the Eagle anointing come down upon the picture and this hearer alike and may give us a wonderful time together as we look at the Word of God and see our place our proper place in your word we thank you and give you the glory and honor in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen may be seated hallelujah I also have a request for a dear friend in that lives in Arizona originally from the Philippines sister Maryland Gabrielle she was diagnosed to have third-degree cancer and was operated on and is actually recuperating in her home so I just ask that you pray with us for her complete recovery okay now better Branum tried to explain this unconditional covenant that God made with Abraham and he said the next slide he said now he's making the Abrahamic covenant and the Abrahamic covenant according to Genesis a table chapter it was given unconditionally therefore it is eternal oh man I'm glad that we we are in an eternal covenant with God because it is unconditional not if you will I will like the previous covenants made with men Adam and Noah and so forth he said I have I have already done it not I will do it but I have done it past tense that's oh that that that basis faith this should be the basis of our faith hallelujah see not God he said God is determined to save man hallelujah so if God determines to Deus to do something you know nothing can stop him from doing it hallelujah because God is determined to save man he make a covenant he make a covenant if you will are real he would break it man would break it another one you will I will he broke it man can keep his covenant so God saves man by his grace aren't you thankful for the grace of God hallelujah God saves man not by law but by his grace under a covenant that's unconditional unconditional covenant hallelu he said this in you have a gyro number one okay now we go to 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 3 to 5 we're all familiar with the scripture this is spur butter Benham got the diagram of stature of a perfect man I want to read from verse 3 and want to emphasize some things here Bible says according as his divine power has given unto us all things we're talking about divine power here and this divine power the power of God has already given to us all things 2nd Peter is stated in past tense according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given did you know this past tense again whereby are given unto us exceeding in great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped you notice that is past tense all past tense having escaped the corruption that is in the world through loss and then John started enumerated all the videos virtuous Peter I should say started numerating all the virtues and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue analysis and so forth until we reach the final lather of charity in the stature of a perfect man you know sometimes because of the way it's written sometimes I think the believers they think it's their effort that brings the virtuous in because the way it's written add to your faith virtue and add to your virtue knowledge it's like we should be the ones adding to it you know but if if you think about it the very first virtue mentioned here is faith number one how can you add faith faith did not come from you faith is not a product of your effort brother Branham says a very powerful statement but BAM says faith is a revelation faith is something that God God gives to you freely hallelujah you don't have to work for it it's a free gift from God hallelujah that's why when the Bible says add to your faith virtue knowledge and so on it doesn't mean you do the working right or your making the effort to add this virtuous to your life it's simply saying that added to your faith which is a gift of God apart from faith there are more God gave us more hallelujah and this is a part of the what we call divine nature the Bible calls it divine nature meaning your effort has nothing to do with it you know you just become partakers of this divine nature it's like Berta Bram said you know a sheep doesn't make an effort to produce war it's his nature to produce more in the same way you know we don't produce pay but the god that lives inside of us is the one that produces it and God is the one that adds virtue to it and all the other attributes are characteristics that are mentioned in 2nd Peter it's God that adds to it our efforts have nothing to do with it even we just believed the promise of God hallelujah God made a covenant he made a promise a covenant is a promise right he's always faithful to the promise and all we need to do is to believe his promise hallelujah by faith and he will fulfill his part of the Covenant part of the contract hallelujah he also made a covenant in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 25 to 27 with the church he was not only determined to save man he was also determined for man to come to perfection for his church to come to perfection efficient chapter 5 verse 25 to 27 says husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word God has determined predetermined in his mind to cleanse his church wash it clean by the washing of the water of the word that he might present it unto himself what kind of church a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish in other words so that the church can be perfect blameless not a spot huh hallelujah not a sin hallelujah but it's a spotless church and in the Book of Revelations we see the bride singing a new song revelations chapter five and it's the sum of the redeemed we read endless and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof but thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth I say a mentalist Amen so the bride is proclaiming in the book of Revelation that she has already been redeemed hallelujah how are we redeemed we are redeemed by the precious blood of the Lamb hallelujah now we understand that the firstborn in the Old Testament they all belong to God firstborn of animals they belong to God the first harvest belong to God firstborn among human beings belong to God in Exodus chapter 34 verse 20 this is what the Bible says but the first thing of an ass thou shalt be deal with a lamb and if thou redeem him not then shalt thou gray his neck all the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem and none shall appear before me empty hallelujah the Bible is telling us all the firstborn belong to God you cannot take it for yourself firstling of an animal you cannot sell it and use the money for your family for your own needs our firstborn belongs to me God says that's why if you have a donkey that's firstborn the Bible says you helped to redeem it with a lamb you can't sell it you can't use the proceeds of it you can't even use it to in farming and then till in your land you can't use it and use it for anything it belongs to God and you have to redeem it how with a lamb and it has to be a perfect lamb hallelujah so you see maybe the donkey has certain imperfections about it maybe the eyes are crossed a little bit and the ears are sticking out and and the legs are bent you know and there's some scubs here and there hallelujah and the donkey thinks surely they will break my neck I'm dead because of all all the imperfections that I've got you know I'll be dead they'll break my neck but the Bible said it has to be within with the land all the imperfections of the donkey will not be seen because God will look at the perfect at the perfection of the land the perfect land hallelujah he will not even look at the imperfection of the donkey he looks at the perfection of the land hallelujah that's why in Romans chapter 8 verse 29 it says for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son this was the message yesterday I've truly thoroughly enjoyed it we have been conformed to the image of his son that he might become he might be the firstborn among many brethren if you've been born again into the body of Christ by the Spirit of God then you become a firstborn if you are in Christ you are a firstborn considered a firstborn hallelujah but the dáil here is my elder but if you think about rank in the body of Christ in the family of God we are both firstborn it's not older in me because in the mind of God we were Berthoud amen so everyone that's been predestinated in the mind of God and that has experienced this rebirth God looks at you as a firstborn child amen because we are in Christ and you know that there are many benefits to our firstborn child in the Old Testament the usefully receive a double portion of everything and remember the story of Esau and Jacob Esau's birthright being the firstborn he sold it to Jacob and that's why Jacob took the birthright and he had to come back to his motherland to claim his in his inheritance and his birthright hallelujah okay so being firstborn we have to be redeemed by the land hallelujah and that's that's what Christ did for all of us he will deemed us by his blood on Calvary in the book of Hebrews but mom says this I said God looks at Christ not you and it's Christ that God looks at not you it's Christ so if there is no fault in him how can there be fall we're thinking of our imperfections we're thinking about weaknesses of our little sins that we commit every day every single day hallelujah but God doesn't look at it God doesn't look at our little imperfections because he looks at Christ not you and if there's no fault in him how can there be fall how can he find fault when you are dead and your life is hid in Christ through God sealed by the Holy Ghost they that are born of God does not commit sin oh my hallelujah I hope you can identify with this they that are born of God does not commit sin we're not talking about the sins that you've confessed before piety or conversion but it's the day-to-day failings that we commit hallelujah after working that's converted after we become Christians and even message believers we continue to commit mistakes hallelujah how can he seen when a perfect sacrifice is laying in his place God never looks at me he looks at Christ because we are in Christ hallelujah amen oh my aren't you happy that God is not looking at your weaknesses God is not looking at the sins that you continually commit in this life even after your conversion hallelujah you see when a man is converted two things can happen everyone says the next slide in the next slide but about said now on this side when people get converted their mind is set right on Christ and if they're just a little scholarly and don't keep under prayer they will get real cold and stiff and starchy and indifferent and then if they're just a little bit nervous if you don't watch they'll just get radical and wild on this side see they go to sensations and everything fanaticism but then I like what Bertrand said about the church but now the real church is a real same gospel right in the middle of the road it's not cold and starchy neither is it fanaticism it's a real good old warm gospel heartfelt love of God going right down the middle of the road calling from both sides from both extremes right in the middle of the road that's right now and how are you going to get that church is there such a chance how are you going to get the church right out of the word there Urim and Thummim hallelujah amen first first Peter chapter 1 verse 18 and 19 the Bible says for as Masashi know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things a silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot see this takes us all the way to Exodus the scripture that we read that because you're a firstborn that you needed to be redeemed by a lamb hallelujah so Christ became our lamb without blemish and without spot hallelujah that's why God expects perfection in his church and I wrote some scriptures here that pertains to perfection we'll read each one of them fast Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1 therefore having leaving the principles of the ducting of doctrine of Christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and Anna faith or God and so on and so forth let us go on to perfection Matthew 5:48 Jesus said be it therefore perfect even as your father which is evan is it which is in heaven is perfect first questions chapter 13 verse 9 for ye for we are glad that when we are weak ye are strong and this also we wish even your perfection this is the desire of the ministers your perfection efficient efficient chapter 4 verse 11 about the fivefold ministry gave some supposes and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers what for for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry and for the edifying of the body of Christ you see this is what sets us apart from denominational Christians because you know they they also know that the gospel of salvation Christ is the only way they also receive Christ they believe the Word of God hallelujah but you see they became Saints right meaning they've been forgiven of their sins we we accept that but the Bible says we need a fivefold ministry for the perfecting of the Saints they can they they they may be Saints but Saints need to be perfected hallelujah and I'm so happy that God has provided a way a fivefold ministry for the Saints to be perfected hallelujah amen the preacher said yesterday there's no rupture as apart from this message because there is no perfection apart from this message hallelujah and thank God that God has made a way for all of us to come to this state of perfection but if I think about it you know it's it's a real tall order the next slide says God requires perfect holiness we think we have holiness certain kind of holiness but it is not just any kind of holiness God requires Balaban said God requires perfect holiness no one can stand in its image with one little speck of sin Jesus witness the same and said be perfect perfect just like God is in heaven God in heaven is perfect we think perfection is dress and skirts this part of it that's a that's just many times what we think holiness is is just an art outward manifestation or external external holiness we call it hallelujah but Berta Burnham clearly tells us here that less not real holiness holiness is sinlessness holiness being consecrated and dedicated to God being separated from the world holiness is being absent from sin from sinning hallelujah you cannot stand in His image with one little speck of sin you have to remember that and this is a very tall order hallelujah so we need to ask the question do I have this kind of holiness do I possess it but thank God Birnbaum says it's not it's not how God looks at you it's how God looks at no it's not how people look at you I should say it's how God looks at you he says now I'm not perfect in your side can say men we try to gates one another and judge one another but Bertrand said I'm not perfect in your side the Prophet saying is I'm not perfect in your son and said you may not be perfect in my side but what about in God's sight see there's birdlace and if you're born again into the body of Christ then God looks upon you us firm as a perfect as Christ was himself Oh hallelujah if you're born again God looks upon you as perfect as Christ hallelujah amen the next slide waters of separation Bertram said it's nothing you can do it's not by any works you can do at all it's by grace God has give you this offer and you have accepted it in the sight of God you are perfect oh my I love that in the sight of God you are perfect that's the main thing in the sight of men they see all the imperfections hallelujah but in the sight of God you are perfect redeemed washed in the blood of the lamb without fault without blemish without spot isn't that marvelous hallelujah and this perfection stayed the perfection let me say this it's only attainable in this age you could not have this kind of perfection but Obama was talking about and Skippy was talking about in in past ages it's only attainable in this aids sardian Church says he said isn't that beautiful or mine I love that not perfect why because they were justified Birnbaum was talking about the past ages the age of Luther they were justified and Luther preached justification and you had to be sanctified and then filled with the Holy Ghost and there wasn't their own then there wasn't their own and they were perfected by the Holy Spirit in them it's not the Christian that is perfect it's the perfect Holy Spirit in him see that's what I that's why I've said I ain't it ate a holy mountain it's the holy God on the mountain not the holy God in the Holy Church not the holy people but it's a Holy Ghost in the church and its people hallelujah we're talking about the Holy Spirit here residing in it in the hearts of his people hallelujah so in the past we could talk about sacrifice in the Bible speaks about gift love faith Liberty today we have come to perfection and now we speak about a perfect sacrifice we speak about the perfect gift perfect love perfect faith perfect Liberty hallelujah perfect faith can only come by the perfect word today we can also preach about the perfect Liberty because we now have a perfect message brothers and sisters let me let me let me make a statement we have been set free amen we have perfect liberty in Christ hallelujah because of what he did at the cross of Calvary in Ephesians chapter 4 verse 13 it says this is the purpose of the fivefold ministry now it says till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man this is the purpose of the fivefold ministry we need to come together and benefit from the gift god-given gift from this man that God is using to minister to us the Word of God until we all come into the unity of the faith and until we come to the perfect man the stature of a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ you see we are measured against Christ who is the gold standard of perfection the stature of a perfect man is really Christ hallelujah you cannot attribute it to any any man any human being it's Christ alone and by the message of the hour which is a perfect message you can become the word the perfect word BAM said in the message perfect faith Jesus had perfect faith he had it and it come because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you received the word is that simple enough how do you become the word the perfect word you become the word as she received the word if you abide in me and my words abide in you and ask what you will shall be done into you first John chapter 1 verse 8 to 10 now this is every believer is susceptible to this this is self-deception the Bible says if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins then he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned then we make him a liar and the word is not enough there's no two ways about it we say we don't sin we're not only deceiving ourselves we're actually we're actually thinking that we can deceive God there's no way we can deceive God you're just deceiving yourself hallelujah you are a sinner hallelujah but praise God because God looks at his sin first John chapter 3 verse 9 whosoever is born of God does not commit sin so thank God for rebirth hallelujah does not commit sin or unbelief for his seed remain it in him and he cannot see nor disbelieve because he is born of God we say we continue to sin even after our conversion but see God is not looking at your sin he look he's looking at the seed that's in that's in you and once you're born of God the Bible says the the seed of God remains in you and God is looking at that seed and that seed came from him that's it is the world in you hallelujah it's the perfect word hallelujah and there there can be no sin in that seed it's in proof if your God said your sim proof hallelujah that's why brother Branham countless of times he told of this story of the evangelists I think he he calls him Daniel Greenfield in the cousin something else in other stories that he told but he said Daniel Greenfield my justice requires perfection this was of the judgment bar now so the question was was you perfect when you was when you was in your life and Daniel Greenfield thought he never told a lie but in the presence of God that great Shekinah glory every little lie is exposed and magnified and when God asked him have you ever told a lie couldn't deny said yes Lord I told a lie in my life I've stole I did bad things in my life I was not perfect the question was was you perfect when he was in your life and he said no Lord I wasn't perfect I think we can all say this in our life we weren't perfect and said he was waitin to hear the last blast he was ready to hear the judgement of God depart from me you worker of iniquity but instead in the next slide instead said he heard a voice it was the spirit voice he has ever heard in his life and it turned to look and he said he saw the sweetest face that he ever saw said no mother could look could look or talk like that he said as he walked up close to him he put his hand upon his shoulder and he said unto him father that is true Danny Greenfield here in his earthly journey he wasn't perfect but there's one thing that he did when he was in earth he stood for me and now while he's here in heaven I will stand for him all of his sins put it on my account hallelujah Oh aren't you glad that we have a redeemer we have a savior hallelujah glory to God Hebrews chapter 10 verse 11 to 14 we have a high priest right and every priest standard daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man referring to the Lord Jesus this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God and from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot so for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sacrifice by one offering Jesus Christ offering his life for the ran for a ransom for many hallelujah he has perfected them that are sanctified see what I'm talking about you can be a saint but you need to be perfected and we are perfected not by the things that we do not by our own efforts not by our practicing our religion hallelujah but you are perfected because of what Christ did on Carol hallelujah but then we have been perfected we can say that we can confess that but Bell Graham said we still have this stick in nature in us he said and as long I sure in this life are we still in this life as long as you're in this lab you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live it's because of this flesh here hallelujah because you've been born again in your soul the spirit man but not the flesh hallelujah huh it is to be redeemed later on you will help to have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the scene that has gone from you see that's the thing but in spite of all of this we can claim perfection by faith we still have this stick in nature that's why st. Paul told the Philippians in in Philippians chapter 3 verse 12 to 14 we are all a work in progress hallelujah amen Philippians chapter 3 verse 12 to 14 verse 12 says not as though I had already attained this is Paul speaking now not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after that I may be apprehended that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before hallelujah I press toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus hallelujah hallelujah Paul was saying I'm not saying I have attained it but I'm looking to the future amen after Christ has taken possession of my life and thus the I looked at the Greek lexing that's this the meaning of the word apprehended apprehend in the word the Greek word used his Catalan bono which means to seize upon or take possession Paul was saying you know I'm not saying I'm perfect but I'm looking to that time when Christ will take possession of my whole life hallelujah to see his take possession of Christ by his holy power and influence laying hold of the human mind and will in order to prompt and govern it oh my hallelujah that's why we say Paul said I no longer live but it's Christ that believeth within me he has full control of my whole life now my mind my actions everything that sent me Christ controls it completely hallelujah and this is the power of the gospel Berta Branham says I have no Holiness listen to the Prophet now I have no Holiness to present to him but I'm trusting in his Oh his grace and I have it in my heart I have unmerited it nothing I could do to deserve it but by grace he called me and invited me to come and I look to him and he took the desire away from me Miriam says I make thousands of mistakes in each month I say the same amen this is the part of God's speaking now he makes thousands of mistake every month every year sure he said I do but when I see him wrong I say God I didn't mean to do it you know my heart I didn't mean to do that I was trapped into that and I didn't mean to do it you forgive me Lord and then he says if I done wrong to my brother I say brother forgive me I didn't mean to do that certainly God knows my heart oh there you are there is the blood sacrifice there is the power of the gospel that the Holy Church moving on not because something you've done it's something you had nothing to do with there is the atonement oh I'm so glad that's nothing to do with what I've done it has everything to do with what he's done hallelujah and then better madam goes on to say and we want to be so big we were some kind of a big turnaround collar some kind of clothes you know that makes us look so holy and reverent but there is no holiness with us I'm talking to message believers now we think we're holy quran says there's no holiness in us we cannot be holy holiness is of God see certainly it ain't a Holy Church it ain't a holy mountain it's a holy God that's right not not the holy people it's a holy God it's God in the people Peter referred to the mountains figuration as the holy mount it meant the holy God was on that mountain look at it now there's nothing holy about that mountain no hallelujah but it's God descending upon that mountain hallelujah and abiding in it that what that's what made it holy but it was a holy God there the presence of God is what made it holy I can say the same thing about the Church of Jesus Christ it's the presence of God that makes her holy hallelujah we have no holiness a percent to God we're just trusting in his holiness hallelujah now brother banner made this illustration about the wheat plant and he said that the real true believers they go on because the wheat they come in different stages and different form different from the the form that was originally buried and planted the grain the grain of wheat huh like the blades are different they look different from the wheat of grain and the tassels the same and then we go to the even the shop hallelujah that's sweet but better BAM said now from Wesley came forth pilgrim holiness the Nazarenes I'm just thinking but a deal that this is this is the way that the work of God progressed you know from from Lutheran's to the worst lian's and was to preach sanctification and out of that group came to holiness groups pilgrim holiness and everything and better I'm even mentioned specifically pilgrim holiness the Nazarenes and all them little holding as churches a whole lot more closer to the word then that the Lutheran for Reformation Russ but you see when Luther organized that just started those blades and when this comes up all the spirit left at Lutheran Church all that just all but just denominational and the real true believers went on into sanctification Lutheran stopped but the Reeb believers went on into sanctification there's no stopping as long as God is working they walked with God and continued on with the Lord and and and listen to what Moran said and then when the sanctification moved over the pilgrim holiness and so forth the holiness organizations the NASA is the NASA means it moved from there out into this panic hostile age these are critical states now and we will think of holiness we think of the Pentecostal groups the holiness groups and better venom even classified it the holiness the the holiness groups the Pentecostal people hallelujah he said they look more like the whit grain that fell in the ground but you have to look closely and look at the little green now of wheat says it looks a million times more like the original we talking about the holiness group Pentecostal group it looks like million times more like the original wheat that went into the ground then what the stock did or water or what the pollen did but but if you sit down put it under glass and open those little shucks up but we're talking about the shucks now they're just carriers also the grain hasn't started yet it's a little bitty ball right at the back with a big high-powered glass you can see the little tip like a pinpoint and there comes the scene and this here sharp look that looks like exactly like the real thing it isn't the real thing oh my this is what we have to realize sometimes we think we reach it we're at my bedroom said it's not the real thing hallelujah that we'll see that like a pinpoint has to come to that's to grow and come to maturity hallelujah in order to become like the bee four minutes of the original water went into the ground hallelujah and this your shop that looks just like exactly the real thing isn't the real thing it's only a womb now of course America has gone through this first before we go through it in the Philippines you know the message came from America to the Philippines but I see it more in our country people in the message Pentecostal people thinking that they are in the message all it is is a Pentecostal movement all of this is a Pentecostal concept if you look at the way they dress the way they act their prayer life even oh they look sanctified they look holy and and they think they have it they have the Holy Ghost because they're there they live clean lives but I'm thinking now wherever I'm said it looks like the real thing but it's not the real thing Halloween doesn't it doesn't have the substance that's needed hallelujah The Cedars that come to maturity hallelujah and this this is a big mistake of many believers they think sanctification is the baptism of the Holy Ghost because they were sanctified they think they had it no they have to go on hallelujah they have to lay the fundamentals the basic teachings amen and and go on to perfection hallelujah and brothers and sisters we now have a message of perfection we can go on to perfection hallelujah amen it's not by our own effort anyway it's not it's not how how how we show or manifests other to one another before the people it's not how the people look at you it's it's how God looks at you and in the eyes of God you stand perfect because Christ is perfect he has made you perfect a menu low - god that's so st. we sing we sing that song to be like Jesus a man that's like calling the musicians to come I want to be like Jesus it's my desire even though in my physical abilities I'm not able to do it there's nothing we can do to be like Christ but it's the power of the gospel the power of the message that they've heard you can become right likewise because you can become the word as she received the word and we receive the Word of God this morning amen perfection is in Christ our holiness is in Christ our perfection is in Christ it doesn't look at our imperfections the little witnesses the sins that we commit every day but God is looking at the perfect lamb our perfect sacrifice then we can have perfect confidence that even though we have we still have this stick in nature we try our best but we're trapped in this body hallelujah and like the brother said earlier doesn't care how you feel because sometimes we don't feel like we're even saved sometimes but it doesn't matter about how you feel what matters most is what God did on the cross you have been saved you have been justified you have been brought out washed in the water of the word you have been perfected in our day and age we've heard the perfect message hallelujah that can perfect it a man Holloway you be like [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] worshiping hallelujah [Music] [Applause] anybody have a name [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] to that your desire then God will back away [Music] anybody of hominy [Music] now let's see if it's real [Music] anybody else in your family [Music] I [Music] you don't run around him said if God required it when he said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect he made a requirement he said now if he made a requirement and he knows we can't do it said then he's taken care of he made it the word that can be done in him you perfection as in Jesus Christ so he's told us we had to be perfect he made a way missed accept Jesus Christ as your Savior that makes you just as perfect as God is because is his work what about this remind him of his work just remind him of what he said we have no perfection as our brother says nothing in us but in Jesus Christ we're perfect see perfect we think of perfect as being something that were sinless that's not the point perfect means complete complete that's not perfectly complete so if B therefore complete that's what she's worth then probably they're here but her brother how much you appreciate [Applause] really looking forward to this afternoon right you're forward for the word that we can believe except what he saith he we haven't talked any he didn't know that I've been preaching on the statue of perfect man for three months for matter so that's that's good it all works together if the word of god they'll all fit right together right the man just make sure you tell her brother how much appreciated father we thank you for the message we've heard today we believe it and we just ask you Lord that you would just give our brother rest and his body first because we know that Satan does everything in the hindrance to where our physical bodies just give him rest for this evening Lord and just let us all walk together in you help us to walk in you and to believe what you say as you
