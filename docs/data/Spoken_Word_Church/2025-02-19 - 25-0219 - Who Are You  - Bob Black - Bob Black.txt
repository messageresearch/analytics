one more time oh word of God true changing me and changing you we have come with Open Hearts oh let the word of God in let's bow our heads in our hearts Lord God we're so grateful to be able to come and gather around your word knowing Lord that it's going to accomplish his purpose it's not going to fall to the ground or return void Lord but it's going to change us Lord that's our desire tonight Lord is to be changed we know that's what you're you sent your word in in our hearts Lord so that it would make us like you Lord I pray God tonight that you'll take the words Lord that are spoken and Lord let them just drop exactly where they need to drop Lord Lord you know all the needs here tonight Lord you I pray God that you'll give the people exactly what they have need of Lord Jesus Lord and Quicken the words Lord Jesus so that the the real essence of the meaning and the real Spirit behind it Lord drops Lord Jesus and goes right Lord right down into the Heart Lord God with the real meaning and not some just some intellectual conception or some ideas of man but Lord I pray that you'll put the meaning to it Lord Jesus and we ask it Lord now that you'll bless the word we pray in your name I'm going read tonight we'll just uh kind of Jump Right In we'll go to Philippians chapter 2 verse 5 and and take a little topic uh tonight who are you and and Paul says these uh these famous words here in Philippians I'll just pause just a second to for the pages to stop turning I I like that we got all the digital things but it's it's good to have the oldfashioned pages uh we were joking that you know it's kind of hard to read nowadays we got the iPad so we can zoom in but it's we we get by uh so Philippians 2:5 says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be of equal to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even the death of the Cross God bless you you may be seated God bless the word and you know uh brother Brandon when he would preach this sermon and and I think Paul you know is is trying to frame up in our mind that he's telling us really he's telling us be like Christ God wants us to be like Christ let this mind be in you that and and he framing it up here explaining setting the scene for us that the the god over everything over the whole universe left everything come down humbled himself so until he was just a servant in the likeness of man of course you know to think that God coming down and humbling himself like us what what a humiliation this is this you know if you young people maybe not don't quite know humiliation yet but as you get older and older you begin to realize how humiliating the flesh is you go to the doctor and things and have to endure different things and boy it sure is humiliating and that's what God came down from glory and humiliated himself to be like us and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even the death of the Cross so he gave up everything he gave up the final culmination of his life is that God humbled himself come down and died for us gave up all of his life gave up everything and Paul's saying you need to be like that now let this mind be in you of course now to to for our mind to be transformed and our mind to be changed that's what we were just singing about that as you hear the word the word of God is actually grabbing your mind and it's grabbing your thought not not your mind your mind and your head maybe we'll kind of meditate on that tonight but it's it's good to have it in your head and everything but when it drops down into the mind of your heart and becomes comes a living reality then you begin to think like Jesus then then when when bad times come and when troubles come it it's not so it's not so hard anymore because You' got the Faith of Christ down in your soul and your thinking is different and the way you look at things is different and the way you act and the way your nature is different now see we've got to act like Christ not act like Christ but his nature is uh we were listening on the Rope coming up to uh brother R was preaching on uh uh uh now I'm drawing a blank the the the woman that came from from from Egypt to to see Solomon queen of Queen of Sheba and and he was talking about how that we we act how you act shows who you are how you act shows your characteristics and uh Christ is our example of how we should be and brother B would say he said Believers should develop the same humble and obedient and self sacrificing mind that Christ exhibited from being God in form to humbly becoming a servant and accepting death on the cross and we know Matthew chapter 16 says if any man Jesus said If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me so if you want to get anywhere with God then you're going to have to die to yourself you're going to have to die to all your thoughts all of your opinions you're going to have to do like Moses and Paul did and just lay down all those things that you've been taught may all your intellectual conceptions about how things should be and how things should work lay it all down and die and and die and that's that's our problem really a lot of times is we're not we're just not willing to die we're not willing to face the consequences of dying because if you die if you die something's going to happen maybe you'll you start sobbing maybe your your spouse or your loved ones will look over you what's what's wrong with Mama something's happening and some something's taking place you die somebody the world will begin to look at you different you're going to have to go to work different and you're going to have to dress different you're going to have to be changed cuz dying you you got to die to come up in the resurrection of life well that's why we go down to the baptismal pool and we lay somebody down in the water because it's a top of death and when you come up there's a promise that if you've done everything right when you come up God is going to fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you've done everything right according to the scripture then there's a promise you because it's typing something we're I'd be being identified with Christ in his des and we must be identified with Christ in this in this age that we're living in there's going to be an identified Masterpiece how is it going to be identified well we're identified by denominational system identified by the church that you go to identify by who who what Minister you like and what Ministry you follow but we got to be identified by the word and the Bible is actually Christ in letter form now to think about that that all the characteristics all the nature everything that you would like to know about God that it's all bottled up in this Bible in the word that we read and so when you read it it's actually a supernatural book that's it's it's changing you so that you now have the same characteristics the same it's expressing in you those attributes that God thought of before the foundation of the world they're being expressed as you partake of this book and the Bible has got all of these is part of the Bible is all these characters that are in the Bible that are also attributes and also characteristics so when you read the Bible when you when you really read it not with your mind of intellectual conception but when you really read it and begin to understand it begins to paint a picture uh because you begin to identify yourself with these characters you begin to look at the life of Noah and you see how he went into the ark and he went into that Arc with the three levels and you begin to identify well it wasn't it wasn't me it wasn't me that shut the door I sealed myself in just like Noah didn't seal himself in it wasn't me that carried myself through all the troubles and all the trials it wasn't me that built oh and you begin to identify yourself with Elijah and with Moses and with Peter and Jacob and it become you begin to realize that these are not just stories but this is the instruction book for why I am the way that I am and you begin to him maybe all your life you wonder why do I desire the things that I desire why is it that I'm made up this way and the Bible has the answer for why you are the way you are it's your identification and brother will say it was Jesus Christ in Noah it was Jesus Christ in Moses it was Jesus Christ in David amen it was Jesus Christ in no and Joseph is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever do you realize what a profound statement it is to say that he's the same yesterday today and forever that it was if it was Christ in Moses to throw himself in the breach and say God if you you're going to have to go over me if you're going to kill these people then that same God he will demonstrate himself the same way all the way down through the age the same characteristics would be demonstrated even now and you and I the same characteristics to lay down your life to to die for one another to to love and forgive the same characteristics will be expressed in you and I and he would say I'm sure tonight that we ought to find ourselves somewhere in some character of The Bible so that we would know the outcome of that character I know what our outcome will be now see see that's that's not the when you read the Bible it ain't just stories it's you it's about you it's so much about you you until Paul would say that the Bible is like a mirror that you can look in and you can begin to understand yourself begin and now now there's when you really begin to overcome you got to understand yourself if you can understand yourself it ain't about understanding the person in the seat next to you or understanding the person behind the pulpit and that's where we get caught up we want to understand the person behind the pulpit or the person next to us or whatever but if you can understand yourself and look into the Mir and the only way that you're going to really be able to understand yourself because there's so many things in the scripture about how man you just can't you can't you're not going to really know yourself just by self-examination or whatnot but the only way you can really know yourself is to look in the mirror of God's word brother br going tell this little story about the the little the little fellow that you know he said he was probably raised up like I was out in the middle of nowhere in the countryside and uh we we actually uh maybe I shouldn't say this but I know exact the exact spot where the cabin was and we because we always R ride by it going up to Kentucky and we've stopped and pull over to the side of the road many times and we we pull out and we look at that spot and and we see you know just imagine what he's explaining that his mama used to have the little broken mirror on the on the on the tree and and uh and and and and he said maybe this child was raised up like that that they didn't really have a a mirror just a little a broken sliver on a tree that they could go up to and you know Daddy would shave his face in that mirror and and when this little boy went to the city to Vis visit his Grandmama well the his Grandmama uh you know behind the door that was closed she had a mirror on the door and when he went to go exploring he he you know how kids do they go start going through the house and well let me see what's behind this door let me see what's over here and he opened the door and and there was a mirror and he he did he had never seen anything like that before so he started you know he wanted to go talk to the boy and that he could see and he got out real close to it and he said brother R said he turned around he said why why mama that's me now brother brand ain't just telling the story just for a little fun little story he he's telling he's explaining your exper you and and my experience when you read the Bible and you begin to recognize that that's me that I'm reading about when I'm reading about David crying on is bed at night and when I'm reading about the the Queen of Sheba going after wisdom and read about the wise men following a star and you read about all these stories it's not just stories but about it's about me and and there's power in these stories but because it's what gives you your identity the the word gives you identity and the word gives you your courage and your strength to know you don't get your identity from your mama or your granddaddy or what somebody said about you but you get your identity from the word of God when you begin to identify yourself with what the scripture says and he said that's what we want to look at tonight I I want to look at me and now look how he's saying I want to look at me amen I don't want to look at you I want to look at me amen and I want you to look at yourself is what he said that's a quote I want you to look at yourself and I want me to look at me amen he said I want to see myself and God's looking glass cuz if anything will show you where you're standing it's this book there is no book like it CU it is all truth amen this mirror it it shows us ourselves now you know you know the Christ Christian business is really a a lonely a lonely business it's something that you really and and and this kind of stum stumbles us sometimes we want somebody to help us get out of our predicament but you know in the greatest battle ever fought brother told us that that's right you got to get out of your egg shell on your own so many times we want to you know blame somebody else for not getting us out of our predicament or put the responsibility on somebody else but it's it's really us it's up to us it's up to you to look into the mirror of God's word cuz the only the only one you can't help a little chick get out of an egg it's up to the EG the little chick to hatch their way out of the egg by speaking but with their mouth by you know a Christian gets out of the egg by speaking the word and you just keep pecking and pecking until you get out by yourself and so the mirror is to show us ourselves amen it's not to show us one another right it's not to so we can look at one another and you know so many times I've down through now we know all all down through our Christian Journey we've we've stumbled and seen one another you different people poke at one another and say horrible things and what I'm talking about tonight though is identity that people will say sometimes horrible things about one another they'll label one another people will say you're a charismatic or fundamental or a Pentecostal or whatever but that's not where you get your identity from people people will put labels on you out of the Bible and say all kind of stff I've heard people say you know what I don't even think that person's born again I well listen that person over there is stupid or say horrible things about what but you know maybe your parents have said those things about you but you see that's not where you get your identity it's from things that people say about you you get your ident from what the word says about you but can I just stop and say for just a moment that if we if we get caught up and saying and labeling one another and then those kind of things see what Jesus said about it he said I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother Rocka shall be in danger of the counsel you'll be in danger of being hauled in front of the counsil but whosoever shall say thou fool sh shall be be in danger of Hell file you know what thou fool means this it means like calling somebody spiritually worth worthless before God you realize what what a horrible thing to say to say about another Christian person where that person there's just no value in them and what what what Jesus was saying is if to do something like that to make an accus that fool is to is is to put yourself in danger of Hellfire while because it exposes that there might be some character flaws there to look at another brother and say well I don't even think that person is born again now now we got to balance it out there because you know brother brandham even in some places he said I questioned that sister's experience now we balance it out but we're not curling accusations and things like that and and say calling our brothers worthless and things like that but to call your brother unregenerate or or whatever you look the point I'm trying to make tonight is you're are not identified by a label that someone else gives you you're identified by that look what brother R said he said don't say nothing about Christians maybe some of them don't live just right or do just right but that's God's child let the father take care of his own kitties you know if we go to fight one another God give us both women maybe so let's just leave the other fell alone and pray for him try to love him and correct him and maybe God will help him God wants us to use the word is our mirror step up to the mirror like that little boy there in that room when he flipped the door around and look in that mirror here and begin to identify and and do what remember as we get older we look in the mirror we see all the bags under our eyes and the wrinkles and things and we start remembering I remember when I got married I remember when I met my wife I remember all these things and when you look into the word of God you begin to remember just like the children of Israel did when they went up to the river the the River Jordan and they looked at those stones that had been piled up they begin to re remember what God had brought them through maybe we could do that tonight as we look into the word of God remember where God has brought you through remember what he's done for you and be reminded that if he if he was there then he's still the same today he's still with you today and and what's happening is in in second Corinthians Paul explained that we are with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord we're being changed as we look into this mirror of God's word amen now aren't you glad that you don't have to stay the same aren't you glad that you don't have to stay all right like the the cocko bur that we the other day brother random was saying that as before the service that God can change you from a cockabur to a grain of wheat that God can change you from the way that you used to be to the way that now well to to to be like Christ and it's good to know who you are who you are as a church and that's the question we're asking tonight who are you it's good to know who you are am who are you as a church who are you as a people who are you as an individual we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are amen now that's something is it that you you got to know who you are in order to have faith amen not just because somebody told you like like for example preacher could stand behind the P Pulpit all day long and tell you you're the you're the manifested uh son of man for this age you're you're this you're that and it'll just go in your head and it's good intellectual learning but you really identify Yourself by Revelation and that begins to change things not you're not looking by mental Faith anymore but you're looking by Revelation that's what we're that's what that's the target we're trying to achieve we got to know who we are and order to have faith cuz when you know who you are then you begin to look at things different and Jesus gave us the example of what we ought to be looking at when he reflected his life to us through the word what we should see when we look into God's mirror brother R said we should see our s identified with him that is a perfect example and who you are actually manifests as we're being changed in your character because your character is who you are amen he said we find out that as we go along through life that our character molds the image that we are each one knows that you as you live so is your character molds you to what you are along and along things begin to change you look back and see that you're different and now you're like maybe that eagle in the chicken yard you you think about that eagle in the chicken yard looking around for years and thinking something was wrong with him that eagle in the chicken yard looking around and and maybe all the other chickens were telling him something's wrong with you all the other chickens and look at the nature the characteristics of the chicken characteristics of the chicken is to find a little flaw and to keep pecking at it have a pecking order so somebody's above you and you're above somebody else and have all the all the characteristics of a chicken but that eagle I just don't like that something's different about the eagle yeah and one day he heard Mama scream and he began to realize why cuz he began to identify with himself with that mother eagle flying above and begin to realize I I ain't a chicken now that's the story of every believer you begin to you you're an oddball you're set in this world and something's different about your nature and and and you go along and you you don't understand why there's something in you hungering and crying for God like that duck that's crying out I I and that that duck in the chicken yard that that that knows he's craving something but he don't know what it is until finally he gets a whiff of water and the the water is the thing that he's been craving for all his life well that there there's the explanation for for why I am the way I am thank God tonight that we can say that you ain't a chicken you're an eagle you can you can spread your wings not not by your own power but have confidence and the Winds of faith that can lift you up up up into the heavenlies that you ain't you ain't a chi and your identity comes from the word you know an eagle an eagle in the Barnard ain't got nothing to prove an eagle all he's got to do is just have faith and hop up on that fence Po and look look heavenward to where is to to where he come from and spread those wings and fly Heaven an eagle ain't got nothing to prove to nobody so you know just be genuine whatever you are just be real because you you don't have to prove anything if you're a real genuine Born Again believer it's going to manifest and the real genuine character you don't have to be something that you're not amen and that's where you know that's where complexes come from complex has come from that you know you you feel you got that feeling of inadequacy or Pride or or you got a need a special need to compensate maybe because your parents put you down or or they didn't never really treat you right or your your your family always put you maybe in a corner or something and didn't really and now you feel like you've got something to prove maybe like that eagle in the barnyard maybe that eagle had a complex for a while we could say it like that until he realized realized what he was oh an eagle an eagle has no need of a complex if you know where you come from you don't have to prove nothing to nobody you don't have to put on a show you don't have to be like a crow that's putting peacock feathers in to prove that he's something that he's not oh just be real genuine church that's what God wants us to be that's why that's why God wants preachers to preach the way that they preach not to try to preach like somebody else but to preach the way that they that God has put them in the church to preach and he wants singers to be genuine enough to sing the way that God wants them to sing and not try to act like somebody else but just to be real genuine and be a real have confidence in what God has made you to be and Eagle's Got Confidence in his wing W in The Winds of faith and his wings of that Old and New Testament oh I got to meditating on complexes the other night and you you know there's so many things that can cause complexes I was I was looking at my kids and I and I think you know there's I got four kids and if you don't know that they're all sitting there and and and you know I I I got to thinking you know there's so many things that I could do wrong as I'm raising and my children that could actually instill instill something that they'd have to do get over the rest of their life right amen and I tell you I began to meditate on how God you know when God God has all of us children and he doesn't have any any favors we're all the same in his sight and I I have to say tonight that I think that's one thing that can really harm your children is when you begin to elevate one or the other and you put one up up and one down and then the whole rest of their life they're struggling with a complex because they're trying to wonder why does mama and daddy prefer this one over this one why does mama and daddy like this child over me why is Mom and Daddy giving all these gifts and things to this child and not this child why why do my parents that are supposed to love and be there for all of my children why are they preferring this one over that one and then the rest of their life they're struggling why why can't I go to holidays when the other kids can't why can't I do why don't I get presents like the other kids do for Christmas why don't I get this and and then the rest of their life they got to deal with a complex that maybe just their upbringing put on them now you know maybe you think tonight I'm talking about the children but there's a lot of adults sitting here tonight that maybe have been in that same situation where just growing up being in your environments you you didn't get treated maybe with the way that maybe you should have and it puts a complex on you because now you're trying to find your identity you're trying to find where why am I the way that I am what is my identity and you're searching for you're searching for something to identify yourself with oh you begin to look into the word of God and the word of God Will trump how you were raised you can begin to break those Cycles where you were treated wrong or your mom Mom and Daddy was an alcoholic or something and they you had to endure all that stuff that your mom and daddy poured out on you and you can begin to break out of all that cycle and break through because the word of God was given to for Liberty Liberty to set you that's what Jesus said there in the temple when he pulled the scroll of Isaiah off and he said the spirit of the Lord is on me to preach Liberty to the captive Liberty is what the word of God gives you not bondage and I tell you that's if you look at the nature of the thing you can actually watch Ministries and things and some Ministries will bind you and some Ministries will put you in captivity but some Ministries will set you free and will loose you and give you something you could take home with you that will put a spring in your step step and a song in your heart to know that God cares about you maybe when nobody else did maybe when your own mother and father didn't care for you I've seen so many examples of where mothers and fathers were harsh and hard and unloving and uncaring and things and they' treat they they they' maybe pass away and they'd leave a great big M bundle of money nether this one over here but not this one over here and you're wondering why how can I how can I deserve anything how can I be what I'm supposed to be I thank God tonight that God don't have favorites that's right if there's somebody over here getting a blessing you can have it too if there's somebody over here getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can have it too and and if we'll raise our family like that amen then you'll raise up children in the admonition of God not having favorites just loving everybody listen I'm sorry I'm I'm I'm going stay on this might as well stay on a little bit like brother Andrew Glover says I'm I'm here might as well camp [Applause] out as I watched my children develop you know some would would do things you're like I wish they wouldn't do that and and some you know that go through periods of things where some are are are more studious and reading the Bible and you'd hear the tap playing and whatnot but all the while they're all my children and just like that story of the prodical son that prodical son came back out of the pig pin and he was still the child and he got the robe it doesn't matter they're all your CH they should be they should all be your children and you should treat them all the same you're here you might as well receive it you got children God give them to you he laid them in your hands he laid them in your lap to raise you might as well treat them all like your children you know any child of God can claim any benefit any benefit you need tonight if you need healing if you need salvation it doesn't matter whether you're rich or poor or or whether you've been like the prodical son and been laid in the pig pin tonight you can claim it because God the only requirement is to believe him believe and you can receive what God has in store for you I I love this scripture in Psalm chapter 84 it says for the Lord God is a son and shield the Lord will give Grace and glory and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly so if you got a neede tonight you can claim it you don't have to look over at your brother or your sister and think well why why do they have peace and I can't why do they have this or that and I and I can't have it there ain't no favorites in the in the Kingdom of Heaven you can have it if you can just believe it amen that's right our identity is in the word many times you know the devil will come and he'll influence how people look at you that's what we're talking about tonight you can get so down by what somebody else thinks or feels about you and that's the the devil the devil will come and he'll distort things and something you didn't even mean to do he'll bend it around in their head and before long they're upset with you and that you're upset with them and and it's just all the devil creating Discord and and you know what you can start listening to things that people say about you and I like I was saying that I don't even think that they're born again I don't think I think there's something wrong with that person and it begins to pray on your identity what is it it's the devil and what I'm talking about tonight is how to combat the devil how do you combat the devil is the same way Jesus did when he he stood there all the power in heaven veiled in that Tabernacle and he didn't use none of it he didn't call down angels from heaven but he combed the Devil by the word and that's how you're going to combat the devil when somebody calls you a label or something you don't like you don't have to accept it you can respond like that eagle did with the little squirrel was yapping away well I know where I come from because I've got an identity that come oh I God thought about me before the foundation of the world and I know where I come from when I know where I'm going and it doesn't matter what anybody says about me listen as a Believer you got to know who you are cuz that gives you power it gives you faith if you don't know who you are then you can't properly believe it's see it's the devil's job to identify this message is wrong everywhere you look on the internet the the devil's doing his job to make this devil look that this message look fake and make it look wrong and my wife and I were looking on on Facebook earlier today there's this big thread where somebody's trashing a preacher and and just running him through the mud and the devil's the devil's doing his job and if you don't know what you are and if you don't know what this message is then you will fall to that you got to know that it's right by the scripture and you got to know that you are right by the scripture don't let the devil identify you amen you got to know who you are yes sir amen that's it what I'm talking about tonight is you got to know when you got the Hol when did you get the Holy Ghost let's ask this question tonight sir when did you get it when did when did a a a personal transformation in your life begin to begin to work when did you experience a personal relationship with Jesus Christ amen did you ever you got to know brother I I know where I was when I got it amen I remember where I was and and it wasn't just a little hope so maybe something I I know that I I'm identified with the explanation that that was given in the book of Acts and I'm identified with the explanation that brother random gave can you say the same thing I know the effect that it had on my life you got to know in John chapter 14 he said yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you you got to know he said you'll know at that day you shall know and the word will identify itself amen now to think about let's meditate on that we're at the top of the hour when everybody starts getting drowsy let's get let's get over the the hump in the middle of sermon you got to the word when the word begins is birthed in you and begins to grow and form like looking in that mirror you begin to be changed changed and then the word begins to identify Itself by its nature right now that's how you can identify God is identified by his characteristics you you say well I got all the doctrine but is the life actually manifested because the identification in this end time is the token life the token has to be manifest and visible that's why brother R preached it's got to be visible it can't just be something that's hidden away but it's got to be visible and he said now listen he listen how he framed it he said we also the Christian Church itself which is of no denomination but of a nature the Christian church is not of a denomination right brother but it's of a nature all throughout the world there's different denominations but we've been called out of a denomination to have the nature of Christ and that now that's why the Holy Ghost let's define what the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost is not a Doctrine or theology no where where you've stacked up all the firewood or you got the nice chromed up car sitting in the driveway you've got the mechanics but that is not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is a person amen and that's why when God gives you the Holy Ghost he will manifest his characteristics in you you will not just know about it but it will be living in you you will be the walking living manifestation of Christ now not all at first because it's a growth development process but Christ will slowly o and surely over time transform you until you have the characteristics of the person Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and if you think tonight that we've got all around the world we've got brothers and sisters in Nicaragua and Honduras and Sweden and Switzerland and the Philippines all around the world that have that same nature the nature of almighty God that nature of almighty God in Africa will make a woman cover herself when she gets filled with the Holy Ghost that nature in Nicaragua will do the same thing that nature in America will make you act the same way because it's the nature the nature of God in you and brother R would say when you're a Christian in your nature is a Christian you don't have to say you can't smoke you can't drink you can't do this you don't have to say that amen they just don't do it anyhow see their nature is different the spirit of Christ is in the person and Christ don't do those things see you say you have to love the Lord you ought to go to church you don't have to tell them people that they go anyhow they'll walk through rain see they'll walk through rain in Nicaragua but they don't do it in America know it's the same nature in a born again Christian they'll go they'll do whatever they got to do to get to the word of God CU it's the nature and he said that's what's the matter with the Pentecostal church today it's soring and puffing and enough temper to fight a buzs saw and then wonder what went with the Holy Ghost back fightings and fightings and everything else amongst the Christian church I wonder where went the Holy Ghost he said another place why don't you want to be a miserable why do you want to be a miserable decrep ungodly Crow for when you could be a dove certainly you just have to have your nature changed and you change your nature become a son and daughter of God be at peace with God now to think that God can change your nature from an old s pig that likes to roll around in the mud and change that nature to where you're a dove that that you can't stand the things of the world it's a nature change something on the inside changed that's why it it's not just oh we're not just trying the conclusion of the matter is not to get you to doctrines and theology where we can whiteboard things and diagram things but the conclusion of the matter is a transformed nature in other words a living consuming fire you know before the day of Pentecost they had been taught by Jesus for three and a half years but the fire of God fell on the of Pentecost and it consumed all of their old past all of their old nature all their thoughts and it changed them it takes fire fire consuming fire to make this word lives in other words it takes more than just sticks sticks is not the ultimate goal it takes more than just sticks stacked up on the side over there but it's it's got to be on fire I'm reminded of how John Wesley said if I if I could just be on fire then then the whole world will come and watch me burn and you know that's how to transform your home that's try to transform your work is get on fire for God let let God get a hold of you until you're just a flaming Ember and then then everybody will come brother BR said they won't read their Bible but they they'll look at you they'll look at your life they'll look at you cause you're on fire for the gospel oh that's what I want my life to be lived I want to be so on fire until until there's nothing left to me but J Jesus Christ that's what Jesus said in John chapter 4 when we was talking to the woman at the well he said God is a spirit it's got to be the spirit of God moving in the church to make the word live God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth brother Adam said it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real maybe time sometimes we go down that road if I just study study long enough I know I've been down that road before if I study and study and study but but that's not it it's not you can study and study and study like Solomon said until it's just becomes a weariness to the flesh but when the spirit comes in the spirit will give the real hidden meaning to it he said it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people amen it will take one with prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from God you hearing from God is it's like reading the Bible and and you begin to identify yourself with the scripture you know you know when you when you preach the word something that's Supernatural is actually happening AB the words are going forth but yet so many people don't actually hear from God but some do right the word is going forth and God speaks to hearts and and then others it's like it just goes right by and they don't hear but if God can reveal it to you that's what he's talking about it will take the re it will require the ability to hear from God Supernatural instruction brother R said the biggest part of our faith is mental Faith by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God but if this coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes this yeah there is a Godly spiritual Faith then what does that Faith do that Faith recognizes only the word do you realize why we we can't just rely on a mental conception of the message because when bad things happen when your family gets sick when cancer strikes that mental faith can only go so far but when it's a supernatural Faith Supernatural faith can speak to a mountain and the mountain will move Supernatural faith can speak to a fig tree and something will happen Supernatural Faith knows how to withstand all the obstacles Supernatural faith can go to prayer for your children and something will happen in their lives or your family Supernatural faith when you know that there's a God that will listen and you have been identified with the word and it's not just something that you learned about it's not just sticks that you stacked up to the side and and just sticks laying on your shelf but it's a consuming fire that has made it real that's what I want a real Supernatural Faith living in my life oh Moses had been taught all those years down in Egypt by his mama it was just sticks until he came to a burning bush and he met a consuming fire tonight have you met the consuming fire or is it just sticks to you but sure it's going to be sticks at first it's going to be just stacked up stacked up over to the side and your mental Faith but that's not the end of the story it's got to be real it's got to be a real Revelation something that will change your life transform your life mental Faith can't do anything it's just limited frail and weak but a spiritual revelation will move mountains you know there's there's even time you know you go to church services sometimes and different places and there's times you hear things and and it's the word of God but it's put together intellectually and if you put it to intellectually if you put it together intellectually it'll always lead you to an intellectual conclusion usually the intellectual conclusion is look how much I know wow look how much I got stacked up look at all this knowledge that I've got and intellectual conclusions introduce human nature why because it's come from your human nature it's come from from your mind it didn't come from a spiritual Revelation but it was put put together intellectually and Human Nature has all these weaknesses and fear is one of those weaknesses and the moment you start depending on your own ability my mind my I'm depending on how much I know and my own intellectual ability then now you've got the element of fear what if it doesn't work what if what if I can't do it anymore what if it just won't work what if I don't work cuz you're depending on your own self instead of something Supernatural and the element of fear is that thing that needed if someone's going to control your life and you'll find as you as you go through life that every false prophet is going to have an element of fear so that they can take control over you and that is a characteristic of nanism that wants to detail every element of your life so they got you doing what they want how they want when they want they got you controlled and you'll find out that that nianis spirit that brother R talked about in the first church ages the first three Church Ages was all about control it's controlling by an intellectual element that doesn't come by faith but Jesus but but Paul told Timothy God ha not given us the spirit of fear that's why that's why the preaching of the Gospel by Revelation by real Supernatural Revelation does not bring fear it is not control but it sets Liberty it sets it brings you to a place where you're not bound by those things that your mother and father told you it brings you to a place that you're not bound by something that maybe maybe a minister years ago told and set you into a place of bondage but it loses you Revelation by the spirit is Revelation by the spirit is what will take us in the Rapture our God is a consuming fire and you know what fire does it creates an atmosphere y'all doing all right you're not y'all if y'all get tired on me and draw back I might I might stop fire creates an atmosphere you know everybody's got a nature and everybody's nature creates an atmosphere I I found that quote I didn't have it in my notes but but uh you can go look at it on Facebook where brother R was asking the question what would it have been like to just sit and listen to Jesus and that atmosphere that he created that of of of Godly fear and and the other things that he said love and and so forth that when you would sit around Jesus that it just that atmosphere why because fire is going to create an atmosphere you you know you can't get warned by painted fire you can't get wor warned by just a mental intellectual conception uh of the words laying there on the page but when a consuming fire comes and sets it a blaze then there's something that you can get warmed by and a fire creates an atmosphere I I we got a picture that we like to look at years ago when we we we had the wood stove going downstairs in a cold winter and and all the kids were sitting around you know playing their little games and and that fire that wood stove set the atmosphere for the whole room and probably the kids wouldn't have even been in that room if it wasn't for the wood stove that was warming up the whole place heating up the walls and and that's what fire does is it just it just it it draws everybody to the thing and brother R would say now you have seen people that you just love to be around yet they might not exactly be in your bracket of society and again they might be of A different race the colored or the brown or the yellow but there just something about that character that you just love to be in their presence and you put out an atmosphere he said because each person is a little Dynamo of their own what is it it's the nature the nature of Christ that's right being put out the nature of Christ now I want to remind you you'll never really know if you're putting out the nature of Christ until you can identify yourself in the word you're you're not going to be able to know if you're putting out the nature of Christ by reading romance novels and and watching movies and figuring out whether you like Spider-Man or Superman better but you look into the word of God and you begin to identify yourself with that and begin to see that you match up with it that's that's the shest evidence like that eagle that could look heavenward and see it see where he come from he said you see people that were noble people but yet you were always glad to get away from them it's just they create such an atmosphere around where you are nothing against them they're nice people but you just don't like that atmosphere and their character creates whatever they are makes them what they are now if we get to look at the character of Christ brother R said his loving character of love oh for us it makes plain John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life what's he saying the character of Christ was what Paul was talking about there in Philippi Philippians uh that that that God would come down and humiliate himself in flesh to save us come all the way down and humble himself he said that's what he was that's who he was and that's why he was to save you he become you that you might become him and he said now you study that character a little bit and look then look at yourself and I look at myself you cannot no way ever produce a character like that only accepting that character in you amen and this is not something just to learn about the tonight friends that's right but it's something to experience it's actually requirement these virtues are required sir you know this this diagram that we got on the wall back behind here is is character it's the character of Christ amen that when you hear the word it birth verse the word in you and then that word starts pushing out character now the world can see the same meekness and the same virtue and the same knowledge and Temperance and all the way up until it's the same character and it makes you an oddball and makes you a different and it makes you produce and live the same way that's it he said if his sinless nature God expressed himself through that sinless nature it shows that our nature is evil and no matter how much we try to patch it up or how much we try to indument it with other thing things it's got to become sinless like his was and then God's word can flow through it and that don't mean perfection in yourself you can't be that but you see even our people are getting away from the practice of holiness but what what's he talking about we got to come to a place of perfection now now hang on just listen just for a second listen real good Perfection don't mean that you don't make no mistakes it's your character amen your character right what do you do what do you do when you offend your brother you you say something you shouldn't and he said we're going to be prickly all the way up to the Rapture yes sir you say something you shouldn't what's your character like is your character that you're going to go make it right say brother I forgive me I I done wrong or is your character that stubborn nature that he talked about that little German boy that was unregenerate because he didn't have the Holy Ghost but he was so stubborn I ain't going to ask forgiveness I ain't going to do nothing see it's your character it's the character Perfection doesn't mean sinless perfection in the human sense it's surrendering to Christ Christ is the one that makes us perfect perfect and he puts his nature in us to mold us and and put his own character until we're till we can look in the mirror and see what see Christ amen see Christ reflected back now that's what I want that's what I want tonight to to to not to look in the mirror of God's word and not see myself reflected back CU if I see myself reflected back there's there's something wrong I see all my own weaknesses all my own failings and things but if I could see Christ reflected back and you'll see Christ reflected back if you're identified with all these characters in The Bible all these people in the Bible all these stories in the Bible brother R will say a man can't be that in himself there's no way to educate him to it it it ain't education I'm I'm going be a good educated message believer but there's that won't do it there's no way to join it I'm going to be a good little Lula I'm going to come to church every Sunday and I'm going to I'm going to Proclaim to everybody how a good legalistic Lula I am so that I can brag about how often I come to church and I have a star by all my attendance record but there there's no way to join it there's no way to baptize it there's no way of doing it that he said the only way to do it is to kill it you got to die so that you can be reborn let it be born again and and what a new nature come in a new nature not that old nasty nature but but like Paul said a new lump with all the leaven taken out of your soul and then you can grow and start pushing out and and he said that's the only way kill that nature of yourself that you might become you know I I like that Story of Lazarus because Jesus gave Lazarus enough time to die and then he could go and bring into life sometimes we ain't died enough yet sometime you know tonight that we don't have an altar up here like the Romans put an altar up at the front where where you come and you do like the the old Pagan Romans and kneel at the altar but tonight you've got an altar in your heart if you'll just kneel down at that altar in your heart metaphorically speaking just lay down all your own desires and things say God open yourself up to the word of God and say God I I'm tired of being the way that I am I want you to come and live in me I want to be changed I'm tired I begin to realize as I look into the word that I'm not I'm not what I thought I was maybe tonight you begin to realize that all you've got is a bunch of sticks you've got the word maybe you've got the doctrine piled up but it's time to ignite the doctrine it's time to let it come into a blazing Inferno so your whole family and so your whole workplace can see that there is still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that he's still alive and well oh why don't we do like Lazarus and and die completely so when Jesus comes he can raise us up and we can be like Lazarus was and everywhere Lazarus went he was a testimony this Jesus of Nazareth has got to be real cuz he was dead he was in the grave and this person has come to newness of life oh then you you can be a living walking Bible like Jesus like brother R said people won't read the Bible so God has made you a Bible God has made you up now now that don't mean because of how much you know that don't mean because of the stockpile of information that you've got in your head nobody cares how much you know but they'll care about a risen savior in your life where they could see Christ manifested in you and signs and wonders following oh I I love when I go to different places and and people will say what has God done recently in your life and you could tell of all the things the miraculous things because the scripture says that signs and wonders will follow them that believe why cuz it ain't dead it's living it's a living reality God is still alive today he ain't dead in the grave but He's Alive walking in your feet using your hands and using your eyes and you don't have to do anything that's right but let him just let him as we stand to our feet let this mind be in you just let him let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus I wonder tonight if we're willing to let him just open up our mind and let these words roll around take root yes when we let his character be in us then we have become Sons by having the mind of Christ mind which is his character your mind makes your character let the mind of Christ be in you it molds the character of a Son of God Amen I wonder tonight as the musicians come do you know where you come from do you have do you know what your identity is you know the early Christians that didn't care what people said about them they could mock them and they they they call Jesus B's above what do they call you amen call them all kind label them with all kind of different things right but they knew their identity regardless of all the religious people of the day yes sir you know brother R said if you know who you are then you become an invincible Army amen right why cuz the devil can't what can the devil say he can chatter away like a little squirtel right and say you're this you're that but if you know what you are right brother man because you identified yourself in the word the devil can't put nothing over on you Lord God lord we're seeking our identity tonight Lord I pray Lord if there's anybody that doesn't know what they are Lord I pray that you'll speak to them tonight and reveal to them Lord that the answer lies in the pages of this Bible the answer lies in the word I pray God that you you'll put a desire in them Lord Jesus they'll go searching and seeking with a desperation I pray God that you'll restore a sense of desperation Lord Jesus I believe it's in this hour Lord we need to be desperate yes I want to

take them with you put them to put them to action Lord Jesus we just thank you once again father for the opportunity that you've given us Lord to come to the house of God to worship you in spirit and
