[Music] say it to him again [Music] my heavenly home [Music] amen you feel like traveling on feel like god's done something in your life then you need to praise him for it say thank you god thank you lord for doing what you did to me he died to save your soul no man could do that only god could do it himself amen we can die and be heroes and they can put a a monument up that says someone so died for so and so but that life of that person can't go back and make that person better but the man we know that died his life went back in to you and i and made us better people and gave us eternal life

nuggets i sat back down i said lord what can i say to get it started watch this oh we have a word for us all at this time it is hold fast persevere don't give up put on the whole armor of god use every weapon that he has given us use every gift in our disposal and look ahead with joy because we are going to be crowned by him who is king of kings and lord of lords the scripture tells us in hebrews 10 verse 23 said let us hold fast hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for his faithful that promise thank you and uh sister abby's in the back her and levi we got two cousins working together back there in the back so uh i just hope they don't get in a fight like cousins do so y'all be nice to each other for a little while but uh god bless you we love you with the love of the lord good to have each and everyone over here i don't think we have any visitors everybody's been here before so let's bow our heads as we begin to continue on with them who is this son of man part 51 let's pray dear lord thank you today for all the blessings that you give us and surely you told us to hold fast that profession that we have lord we come to the end time now where you got a hold of something and as a oh what a wonderful song hold to god's unchanging hand you're the only one that's unchanging you're the only one that's eternal you're the only one that knows what's going on you're the only one that's perfect so lord may we look to you today the author and finisher of our faith lord that our faith may rise up that we can take this pressure of the end time lord all the different things that are going on in in the world father the world's falling apart but your bride is going to be caught up in the in in the clouds and be moved over into another dimension this world is going to be in turmoil lord today we don't we don't want a person be left behind we want everyone to go with us lord so i pray that we diligently then lord seek you hold fast persevere lord even though it looks bad clouds and all the different things storms of life but lord there is a sun that's shining and lord may you shine down upon us today lord give us the words of eternal life for your people father father thank you for all the ones that are here and brother michael being developed lord is coming up to to having a an anointing there to teach sunday school class father we pray that you just be with him be with each one lord heal the sick bless the ones that are not here lord the ones that are traveling different ones we ask in jesus name amen who is this son of man part 51 john 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god give them a minute they'll get it up there and the word was made flesh and dwelt among there you go and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us now as we've been talking i want you to understand that is you that is your flesh being made word all right now remember it didn't come word for him as bob's bob's gonna have to quit what he's doing he just got to stop just don't do it no more we'll let somebody else teach you because i was sitting back there and i would i was thinking i thought well how can i take that theophany from a from a ball of light and bring it down into us and then of course he puts it on the screen that's god because we don't discuss that that's god that does that so we must need that we must need it when a teacher goes down a line or somebody goes down the line and they haven't discussed yet they all fit together then that's needful for all of us that was needful for me and everyone else amen and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we behold his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth because remember we haven't seen the father but the father was displayed in the sun and now the sun is being displayed into what in the bride all right romans 12 verse 2 says be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove that you may prove you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god had dealt to every man the measure of faith we'll stop right there and you'll be seated lord has blessings we're going to cover that a little bit further about this measure of faith because every age had a measure of faith everybody every everybody is not going to have to come to the body change because there's people that there's thousands and thousands and hundreds of thousands and probably millions of people bride that are laying in a grave somewhere that their bodies already pretty much rotted and gone and turned into dust but there's a soul over in a dimension somewhere that's waiting on me and you to come to some place of perfection they came to perfection in the soul they got the perfect love they got the agape love under their church age messenger i'll read it in just a second remember the holy ghost in every age it goes to the messenger message messenger and then we live it we'll read it in just a minute but let's read first corinthians 13 verse 1 it says do i speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not charity i have become a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries well that's pretty good and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing remember the prophet of god tells us that satan can pass out supernatural gifts all right so be careful if you want if you're looking for gifts i thought the bible says signs follow the believer so the signs are behind you they're following you through your life you're the one that's blazing the trail you're the one that's the god in front of those gifts they won't work without you but let's don't seek for them let them follow us all right so brother brown said signs follow the believer and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor this is a pretty good guy this is a message believer and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing now what does charity mean that's not giving out food that's not taking care of the poor in this case right here we take that as charity but look the bible tells us it's agape love all right which is that love at the top of the pyramid but you got to have it at the bottom to begin with all right brotherly love affection good will love benevolence not the love you have for your wife not the love you have for your brother not to love now you need to have agape love for your brother you got me but that's not the lustful love that you have for for your wife and you say yeah well that's what it is feel your love is the love you have and its own condition whether you love me or not if you don't love me i ain't gonna love you but brother branham says that's not agape love agape love is you love them anyway love those who despitefully use you love those who are against you it's easy to love somebody that loves you it's easy to love somebody that's just oh you're so good and you're so great but when somebody says i got an issue with you and you're like why what is it well we're going to say temperance patience all of the statue of perfect man in just a little while if we ever get to it but we i want to make sure i was praying a couple days ago i said lord i want to make sure everybody's born again if you're not born again you will not understand what i'm talking about and let me tell you something as i said before god's grace is good god's arm is long as sister sister uh um gail used to say god's arm is long amen but there's an end to it god's not a greasy grace god he's not a god he's the god of justice he's a god that says all right i've given you the word i've give you somebody to talk to you about it i've given you an opportunity to get it and if you don't get it this is what you're going to get you're going to get judgment and you know who's you who the problem is you you're the one that's going to make the tribulation period god's not going to make you make the tribulation period you're going to make it yourself i got myself a note think about this as we go along put your faith in what put your faith in what what are you putting your faith in you job brother suresh i think brother uh dutch scots worked for this company for years and years and years made real good money i walked in one day and said we're doing away with your job he's had to start all over and he's 50 years old probably got a wife with cancer hello you gonna put your faith in that gonna put your faith in your car you gonna put your faith in your family you better put your faith in god and we'll we'll talk about a little bit more this afternoon because we have to we've got to hone this faith thing down well i believe in i believe in well you better be careful there's only one faith one lord one baptism all right one not many faiths it is the faith of the son of god so there's only one thing we can put our whole being into and i'll read it to you in just a minute where brother brown says face final resting places where in the word of god not in a study book not in james dobson not in good news for modern men it's in god and your faith listen to me you got up this morning i hope you got up this morning and put your faith in that you're going to learn something from god today when you come to church not that you're going to just show up because i'm going to talk about you if you don't praise god anyway i probably will but i'm just telling you what the bible says i'm not telling you what my my idea this whole thing is if you don't go to church you're lost period i don't care who you are you show me the bible where you can go to church every once in a while show it to me if we're going to put faith final resting places in the word of god then whatever that word of god says listen we've been restored back we're not to where we don't know if there's three gods or one or we don't know if if hell is eternal or we don't know where we're going we know these things and knowing these things my i come to church like coming to school some of y'all didn't like going to school that's okay but i did you know why because i wanted to learn something so if you got the holy ghost the holy ghost wants to learn i i'm going to read it to you to man where god said he's going to put the teacher in when he puts the teacher in it draws you to being taught by what the word of god and you're just an unbeliever if you don't come to church period don't fool yourself i was reading a quote a few minutes ago brother brown said let's not fool ourselves if you're lost just say i'm lost because you know what he will he will go by your confession well i'm saved because mama was saved i'm saved because daddy was safe i listened to two tapes back in 1995. ought to be all right no you ain't all right it's got to be something where you want to come to church you want to listen to god you don't want you know what brother baby said you know what he said one time he said we don't want to come to church to see each other he said if you want to talk to your brother and fellowship with him he said do it outside that's why we don't talk in the church and carry on conversations like denomination they just get up start talking about everything in the world in the congregation no we come in here to what push all that out let the devil be uncomfortable being in here let god be so much in here that he just don't want to be here amen but you got to be born again have faith and be born again not have faith and just say well i i got to be saved why no i pray every day brother dale's 82 years old he prays every day for the lord to fill him with the holy ghost because he always has and the same thing with us lord fill me up if i'm not saved save me because that's my confession but if i walk in and say well bless god i've got it all it's all right here i'm up there at the top and everything's fine i'm just good and you're in for some issues i was gonna say something else but you're in for some issues right amen so we just need to be sober humble going off the statue of perfect man will humble you revelation will humble you it will not make your head swell up because why in the world with something eternal give you that revelation that's the way i look at why did you give it to me lord why you didn't have to but you did you gave me the new birth you know why because i wanted it i wanted to get out of the filth of this world so we have to go through our stages and we've been through this over and over again but like i said before i want somebody born again i want somebody that wants the word of god more than they want to eat some of us are not showing that but i can eat and love god too amen and all of us says amen but put your faith in what you put your faith in the doctors all they have is a book that says this and you know what it says on the front of it practice right you go see a doctor you go see him at his practice god has never in his life practiced he's always been right he's always made the right decision and he's standing there going hey i've got this book right here that doesn't say practice it says holy bible and it's the eternal word of god written before the foundational world he said just go buy it that's our issue we just don't go by it all of us somebody was talking to you the other day you know the denominational world there's people out there that are good people they love god as much as they can and they're in a system though that they can't get everything they need brother brown said they can't get all the way out they get out so far and they can't get all the way out but you and i don't have that excuse you and i are at a place a position right now today to understand it from genesis to revelations and not have a problem with what the bible says amen not have a problem i said with what the bible says about everything raising your kids dressing right eating right doing right coming to church respect for as many are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have what received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry have a father the spirit of self bearing witness with our spirit what that we are the children of god and of children than heirs we're going to cover some of that this afternoon listen if if if jesus was god right here's god right right is that right jesus is a god not a second person then if so be if we're joint hairs with god that makes us good that's too close no it's not close enough i told you we've become a bunch of tunis people where it's bride and christ we gotta see one when god walked in the air in the garden with adam and eve he saw one person and her name was adam before the fall the only separation was when she did what she did and god had to pull her apart not pull her out of that but pull her apart from the from what he's told him to do and set her over here and put her under different conditions all right i was asked that question the other day at work they were talking about the methodist church you know the methodist church is splitting now because they're wanting to have gay um gay preachers or whatever they call them priests gay pastors and women and it doesn't matter if you're a woman to gay or if you're gay and they say well what's wrong with that i said don't ever ask me that question again it all began in genesis well that's the old testament i said let's go to the new testament and paul said i tell you by the word of the lord a woman's not supposed to speak in church you're not supposed to have anything to do i'm sorry if it hurts your feelings that's you know why our problem is we try to worship christ somebody saying man we try to urge your authority over christ well we don't believe everything in here we don't have to do everything you tell us to do right if children deny the heirs of god and join heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be glorified together listen we want to get out of here we got to get all the t's dotted and the eyes peace crosstalk dotted amen we good i figured i fixed that huh some did someone's like okay i might brother dale i but he never did it but he said he was going to do it he's going to come up here and just preach something false off the wall and nobody and see how many people's going to amend it that still may be in the arsenal all right so we we got to start somewhere so we started justification we go to justification which is what is is asking god to forgive you of your sins yes i mean that whole pile load that you had back in bc before christ amen and if if he if you're asking him really asking him he's going to put it in the sea of god's forgetfulness never to be remembered again you're going to remember it the devil's going to remember it but you're not going to remem i mean say god's not going to remember it thank god so with those who he has justified he's already glorified if he's justified you and you continue on continue on hold fast persevere hold fast means to grab on to and hold on hold fast not just old no hold fast brother brown i got a quote back there brother brown said put a death grip on it put a gas grip on it have you ever had put a death grip on that thing think of that well i i just don't know if i don't know if i make it or not that's a real death grip have you ever held something so dear in your life to where you did have a death grip on it i mean you're not getting this this is mine well that's what god told us to do didn't he hold fast persevere have faith and be born again sanctification we're talking about the soul now where the unclean spirit goes out and we'll read a quote here in just a minute and i put several together this afternoon where god listen god is not in your soul along with the devil can't happen everybody good with that you become two souls well i got this eternal seed where is it it's not in your soul where's this unclean spirit leaving from your soul so it will light it in your soul you either faith or doubt now is god doubt no no it's god faith one of the two not both in your soul today if you're not born again you're sold black is sacked and you're lost now listen you might be on your way you might be heading up the ladder you might be justified even coming to sanctification that unclean spirit is going to go out but listen like we're going to talk about in just a little while faith without works is dead faith without showing it you don't have faith let the thing loose as i said before one of these days you're gonna have to let it loose you're gonna prove who you are one way or the other now he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit isn't god's spirit now this is in sanctification that's your spirit god gives you a new spirit then he says i'll put my spirit in him but the thing god has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he can't even live with you so i put my faith in that god sanctified me did you have you put your faith in that god justified you forgave you of all your sins got rid of all that if you don't then you're doubting never with me is there any doubt in god no all right there's no doubt in god so you're either faith or doubt and if you've got the new birth what you've done is you've come through a process of believing he did justify me he did sanctify me got all that smoking drinking cussing just make your laundry list that's that's not at the new birth that's its sanctification because those unclean spirits can come back in because you know what the the hole's not filled up it can come back in and make you worse watch set you in the message church and oh i got my hair long and some of you i got my dresses not tight some of you preach i believe it will ain't never in my life see if y'all can't look over and look at your wives and look at your kids and see that they are living like the world and the dress is so tight you can't hardly pull them off of their body you need the new birth you need the new birth and you women you wives i'm telling every one of you next time i see skin hanging out where it shouldn't be like there's a top with a dress on and they don't meet me and you gonna have a talk but i'm going to your husband first i saw it too much last weekend i ain't saying no more all right baptism of the holy ghost that's that's the issue right there if you got the holy ghost you won't do that are we all right if i hurt your feelings then i'm talking about you so the baptism of the holy ghost is seeing you have what purified your soul in obeying what the truth not part truth the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart what fervently why being born again you gotta have a change you gotta have a nature change because your nature is contrary to god you were born with a carnal mind you were born without god i said before please leave me alone in my revelation of redemption i was lost my whole being was lost i want the whole world to know this my whole being was lost i was doomed and on my way to hell but god by his rich and mercy grace he come one day and said hey let me in no the people in the message says no he's already in there you just want to let him out forgive me if i am going to shout a little bit more that is not the truth amen you're either born again you're not yes sir you either have faith in your soul or not being born why we got to do all this if we always was eternal i know we were in the mind of god i know we were always were eternal by the foreknowledge of god but that's god when we come down here we come down through a filter called sin and we can't give back without him coming we can't get back without him coming to get us that's redemption it's not a replacement i don't know where that come from but i'm going to charge you being born again not of corruptible seed i'm looking at corruptible seed i'm looking at what your mama and daddy produced and if you don't get born again and that will be in a grave and your soul is going to be in hell let me drive that home we can't go up this statue of a perfect man without being born again being born again not of corruptible seed but what incorruptible word of god not a little bitty baby seed that somewhere laying inside of you please oh then the quotas here they go well you was born with this you were born with a representation that you were going to come to it but when you was born from your mom and dad's womb you were lost if william branham said i was lost he said i used to wash my car on sunday before i was a christian this guy's a prophet i used to wash my car on sundays to make sure i didn't go to church and watch all them people go to church a prophet he was lost right but he screamed one day and said god forgive me when he was falling through hell when he was shot up all the you know they shot every how many times and his legs would blow it off he said god give me one more chance i want you to listen to me god's gonna give you one more chance if you don't take it you're gone but of incorruptible seed by what by the word of god you've got to hear the word which liveth in the bible forever listen take hold to that eternal life nothing else to do folks for whom he did for no he also did predestinate yes there is a group of people that is set aside given an angel at birth what to guide you through your life but you're gonna have to make a choice that angel can't make that choice for you that angel can't save you but he knew one day you'd come to it and say ah i'm done have you ever been there before if you have not alters open get to a place and say i'm done i'm finished i don't want to do this no more amen for whom he did foreign also did protest today what to be conformed to the image of his son that's why jesus came to die he died for the whole world but he only he knew in his infinite mind he knew who would and who wouldn't therefore he could place not a seed inside of you but a word inside of here amen everybody he put a word right he put a seed right here that one day a preacher preached and you responded you said that ain't nothing but the truth so that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called whom he called he justified who justified you also glorified romans 8 verse 11 says god has not cast away his people which he foreign there's no way he can like i said before if he loved you before the foundation of the world he still loves you now and he's going to love you for an eternity because he set aside a part of him agape love he set aside that part of that theophany everybody with me because he knew you would or he knew you wouldn't and even though he gave somebody like adolf hitler a million years to repent he knew adolf would never come to a place of repentance so therefore he could predestine his journey to be the cruel man that he was but he didn't make him be cruel to be a just god he can't make you do anything ephesians 1 says in dispensation of fullness of times that's right now this is our dispensation this is us he might gather together one all things in christ both which are in heaven which on earth even in him whom also we have obtained an inheritance why did we need to obtain it if we already had it i was lost i was out of the economy of god i was in another camp i was in another place but i had an inheritance being predestinated by his foreknowledge he saw where my inheritance was the will according to the purpose of him who works with all things what after the council of his own word or will that we should be to the praise what praise of his glory praise god if he'll hurry up i'll get me a nap most of you don't even wait that we should be the praise of his glory first trusting i'm sorry richard i'm doing it again and whom also you trusted look after i didn't trust god when i was a sinner did you tell us things i did i knew god was nowhere to be found oh yeah he was right there he was waiting on you but there's no way listen he won't dwell on an unclean vessel righteousness holiness that's god were you righteous and holy when you were out in the world i don't think you were so listen that makes my plan of redemption way much better is that i was gone i had no hope until he called my name is all right i'm sorry i didn't mean to go this way but this is the way we're going and whom you also trusted look after after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you got to come to a place of believing what what does believing do with faith it puts them together faith and believing is together because when you have faith you believe in something all right it's right sister freddie you have faith you believe in something all right look which is the earnest of our inheritance see down to the church ages it still was an inheritance an earnest it was an inheritance they have eternal life in their soul but there was no way by the word they were given for each age or the faith they were given for each age for them to come to a body change because it had to come to malachi 4. it had to come to luke 17 30. it had to come to the end time that last prophet messenger had to come to draw people out to bring us back to the faith of the fathers so this we're not just looking brother bob we're not looking into earnest anymore this is full possession time until the redemption of the purchased possession of the praise of not our glory his glory acts 1 verse 4. he said unto them it is not for you to know the times of the seasons now this is jesus right before he left which the father has put in his own power but you shall receive power look at that word again after listen you have no power oh we think we got these great big i mean we you know we can do all this weakest people i know is the weakest people that that are unbelievers i don't care how big and strong you are you're an unbeliever you're an unbeliever it's for you know the time of season but you shall receive power after or dunamis after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me in jerusalem listen when they were walking around with jesus they were powerless oh yeah god you know jesus said all right i'm going to impart this go over here and heal the sick cast out devils but remember they couldn't do all that they come back say lord well this was a tough one i can't we can't do this he said all that takes uh more prayer and more fasting [Music] but he told him he said you shall receive power though after now now take and go over to the book of acts and take those same people interject paul in there take those same people peter james john all the different ones now they didn't need jesus listen to me they didn't need jesus be standing there they needed him to be standing there during his life everybody with me because the holy ghost was not given until jesus had been glorified or died and resurrected and came back on the day of pentecost right we know that no one had the holy ghost until the apostles in 120 in the upper room no one had the holy ghost in their soul what about john the baptist john the baptist had the holy ghost it was an anointing it was not in his soul because if it's in your soul you're born again you can't be born again until the testator dies everybody with me i believe john 5 says the holy ghost had not been given because jesus had not been glorified in other words he not he died he had to die to release that that's why they couldn't understand him but boy he said you shall receive power after the holy ghost so he ascends he comes back 11 days later and he goes into the people and they're like whoa [Music] peter said this is that he goes right back into scripture this is that and they received power unclean spirits were cast out they even walked past people in their shadow cast out demons cloths from paul they didn't have a problem casting out demons after jesus came back inside of them amen all right dunamis power and inherent power it's something you receive after that you're born again you haven't listen you're powerless until you have god in your life oh i've got a bank account you wouldn't believe yeah i believe it a few more turns of the sun you're going to go where is that thing in every age every age is the age of the holy ghost for the true believer i say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit in other words got the new birth the teacher heard the word and that spirit of them what responded there ain't nothing but the truth and taught it and revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it followed me amen matthew 12 36 but i say unto you that every idle word wow that men shall speak they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned romans 10 verse 9 said if thou shalt confess with your mouth the lord jesus and believe in your heart not in this thing but your very soul the very core of you shall believe in thy heart that god has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation now what is confessed to admit or declare one's self-guilt listen there's no confession if you don't have guilt you've got to have guilt to confess it's actually pretty simple of what one is accused of james 5 verse 16 says confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man our sister availeth much the word possess means what to acquire to get possess you your soul or procure a thing for oneself to possess to marry a wife let's continue on pretty quick i got to get down to number 13 and we're on number three first thessalonians 4 that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor now listen as we're going to talk about right here look that's your perfect man there's only two elements that controls the human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other you're possessed today you're either possessed of god or you're possessed of the devil but i'm so sweet that person's so sweet yeah the devil's pretty sweet sometimes you rile him up though you get in his face you'll find out but let's just be i mean why do we need a list here's one two either faith or doubt you don't come to church because you don't believe faith or doubt i'm going to tell you where faith final resting place is is right here brother bob and i were talking this morning i've been watching brother donnie reagan a couple of services because he's on a series i want to do later after this and brother bob said he's listening to to brother wayne lawson and they're everyone and i mean hammering on people coming to church because this is that final push if you don't come to church you're lost just say i'm lost i'm sorry i'm lost i'm sorry i and it ain't a rule to me me and you didn't get up this morning and and go well i where's that say it jim does it still say for satan not assembling let me see if i can find that well why in the world would you want to look for it it's been in there since they wrote it there's only two elements that control a human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other you're possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much faith you have is how high you can rise now you come to the altar realize you're a sinner whoa maybe we need to do that and you're sorry for your sins look you repent of what you've done and you can stay there and cry for a week in a week out and that will never save you until you believe that you are saved then you confess it yes amen now can't do nothing for you until you confess it he is the high priest of what you're feeling he's a high priest of your confession he can do nothing you confess me before men i'll confess you before the father is that right what you say i've done down here for you that's what i say the father that in other words he said what i do down here if you if you deny me here i'm going to deny you there and look you say well i've never denied god have you ever done wrong now here he is sitting here to make intercession on my confession have we tried that see these things during the week that i do that are not right as a human surprise i'm still human but when before i walk out when they start calling me out i go over there to that to that um mirror and i look myself in the face and i say god though if you want to throw me away that's fine give these people something use me move me out of the way you use me and get done what needs to be done if you want to throw me out of the building that's fine with me but help these people amen so i don't go over there to make sure my tire's straight i i do straighten my tire once in a while when it is crooked but i look at myself and i say this is this is me and this is me this is the man that has that has sinned during the week you know the little stuff understand me you ever do that when you walk through that door right there huh i mean how many of us bring bad spirits in here because your husband and wife or your kids have been yakking with each other coming up the road and and or even you're yacking with yourself that you've done something wrong or you said something crooked or wrong not crooked but you know off kilter and then you just keep walking wow everything's fine by the way he'll pray it out of me no i won't not unless you confess it renewing of your mind all right but without faith look without faith is impossible to please god for he that cometh to god must believe that what he is god and he's a rewarder there's the promises there's that joint heirs whatever promise you've got in that bible is yours you just got to take hold of them because you're what of them that diligently seek him perfect faith the prophet of god says look you can't be saved without faith faith is something that you have to believe is there like i said before you take your new birth out and show it to me no you i show it by my works i show it by what i do all right can't physically say all right this is my new birth but i have to believe that god's done it you have to believe it so much to you know what your faith unites with his and then it becomes your faith add to your faith this is my the prophet said god gave it to me when god gives you the new birth it's not his anymore it's yours but that's what he wanted to do give it to you and faith is something that you have to believe is there that really nothing else will declare us there but faith now i'm trying to bring faith to you so that you can be ready for a prayer line in the next few minutes now faith he that cometh to god must believe that he is now look it's impossible to please god without faith you can't please him why because you've got that old doubt unbelief god can't stand unbelief it's not you that don't he just don't like your own belief now i'm talking about even in the second realm in the spirit realm he doesn't like your unbelief in that realm either and that's why we're working up the statue of perfect man once we get started but then listen if that foundation is long i'm gonna preach long on faith because we gotta have faith and then be born again all right when we get up here a little bit the brother of kindness i'll say a few words and we'll go home love you brother as yourself that's enough love your enemies as yourself that's hard to do romans 12 should be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god that word there is a renewal now look it doesn't say complete demolition and rebuild everybody with me it doesn't say complete devastation as the earth is going to be destroyed as people believe except for us in the message know that it's just going to be what burnt over your old nature was burnt out it was burnt off of you kicked out god comes in and vulcanizes his soul to your soul somebody with me is that not redemption is that not that's the plan and i'm happy with it leave me alone but i needed a renovation as i said before our house needed a renovation the other day so brother gary comes and renovates our front porch and our back porch but you know what there was a big old trash can there and it was full of trash how about let's back in the dumpster house and get rid of the trash renovation complete change for the worse oh for the better yeah june loves her front porch brother gary she loves that front porch we haven't gotten to the back porch yet because she loves the front porch and i do too i like sitting there and looking out my porch without bugs jim's just so sweet that the bugs are all over her they don't bother me because i stink but they get on her and they get to biting her and now they don't do that so that's great but ain't that happy complete renovation you got something going on you've took the same house you've took the same house but you've renovated it a good coat a good coat of paint not on the outside hello somebody i've seen some of that here too some of that barn paint still it's the same barn like what bob said he saw a preacher online the other day that this is a denominational preacher wow and i think i'm going to do it if i can find some mannequins this preacher brings mannequins into his church and dresses them like the world and dresses this one's like christians world christians separated everybody with me world christians it shows you the difference we ought not have to but visual will help men look like men they don't wear pocket books and and necklaces and high heels and other junk that's the world that's what the world looks like we got to be separated even though the bible does tell us to dress different it does tell us to do different we should be different the world's going to be destroyed one day thank god he destroyed my world back in 1997 and he renovated me and he's still working in all my rooms renovating why y'all make me holler for i'm getting old get a headache when i start hollering for i say that through grace given unto me to every man that's among you not to think himself more highly than he ought to think that's the key folks like i said before if you get a revelation it ought to humble you you get the new birth that ought to humble you we go up to statue a perfect man really going to humble us really going to get where we live it's going to get into them little inner rooms that we don't open except for ourself and we got our little secrets back there according god has dealt to every man the measure of faith now watch let's talk about measure and i want to read the scripture i interjected this this morning ephesians 3 verse 17 i think aaron kind of preached on this several years ago maybe a while ago about the breadth and length and depth that christ may dwell in your hearts by what faith you can't get away from faith it's in every scripture it's in all through the old testament it's all in the new testament and it should be all in this building that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love all right rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and lengths and depths and heights and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god to me that's the statue of perfect man scripture length depth heights that's it that's not a flat that is a flat picture but pyramids are not flat it's got four sides on it our own nature is contrary to god i've been saying that since we started our own listen it's just contrary to god and i promise you it is an effort to get to come to church it is an effort to get up put on your good clothes your good right clothes not the ones you wear out no nevermind have faith and be born again i'm getting off of that have faith and be born again look that's laying the foundation that's what we're going to talk about this afternoon we got to lay a foundation and i think we're trying now to get everybody to realize that if you're not on the foundation you can't go up the pyramid if you you can have a foundation of sinking sand or you can have a foundation of i believe i'll just try to make it on my own you know what you're going to do you're going to stand before the white throne judgment on your own and you're going to have to be judged the bible says by what by what you do by your works thank god he's covered mine confess beloved like when i give all diligence to right unto you i was reading what brother brown was talking about this scripture this is jude it was written 30 years after the new birth on the day of pentecost this was written 30 years after that and look how far they've already 30 years after i'm talking about the holy ghost fail no denominational ideas yet i mean maybe some ideas but no churches no no no i see it at 3 25 a.d yet but in 30 years they've lost their faith beloved when i give all diligence to right under the common salvation it is need for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was lost which was once delivered unto the saints for their what there are certain men creep in unawares who are before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god in our lord jesus christ that is preachers i'm gonna read your scripture this afternoon because we're gonna hone on this a little bit where jesus stood there and he said look you've made my word of none of faith by your tradition that's what satan dilutes the word of god he's still doing it he's doing it in the message he's doing it in the world he's diluting it by saying oh it's okay he didn't really mean this like i said before you you can you can you can prove to me that brother adam was a false prophet but that bible tells you what to do you got to stand before that you don't have to stand before william branham you got to stand before that well he didn't there was 12 people or 16 people fell off i don't care i do not listen if that bothers you get born again if that bothers you that you can't count 16 or 12 or ever how many he had a dream that so many fell off a bridge listen that was in the early 1900s there was no such thing as labor force and there was no such thing as ocean it was then people could have fell down in that concrete nobody ever known it look the guy just goes oops bring us another one why there was no record now you can't get by with it now you got cameras and you got ocean you got all the different things you know count your people so that does not shape me that does not shake you if you have faith if you have faith in the word of god that should not shake you at all but what if it doesn't matter he's took me to this he's taught me that he's taught me how to be a better christian all right lost faith faith of the fathers we talked about last sunday the book of acts was was the faith of the fathers everybody with me this was working in their life except for that everybody with me because the headstone was rejected that's the son of man he was rejected he went to glory he came back in the holy ghost to build a church well now as he was building the church satan gets in and says we need a pope we need a bishop we need to pray to dead saints uh i i you know we're going to tell you what jesus said father son holy ghost well i'm going to take that in acts 2 38 which says the same thing you see what i mean satan has got in there pulled it start pulling it apart so it's a lost faith so that faith listen without even going starting up the pyramid brother brown had to listen let me hold on to your seat everybody grab your seat everybody grab it brother brown had to go up that pyramid okey-dokey then you can let go now i don't want anybody to walk out or fall over he had to go through that and he had to come to a position what did he say it's been 30 years to preach that one sermon of the stature of a perfect man to get it all together to get everything to get him where he was built up where he could he says in there and i'll read the quote later on when we get into the book he says lord build me up that i can teach others how to do this and you say it's not a requirement and you say it's not we don't need that if the prophet of god needed it i need it if the prophet of god needed it you needed it all right so now we gotta have faith for the time that's needed and that's what we said down to the church ages we know the woman that that was healed of the blood issue brother brown says the woman came with a perfect faith for that time because see she was wanting heal she didn't want it wasn't she wanted to get born again right it wasn't she wanted to go up the statue a perfect man it wasn't she wanted to be a woman preacher no she want to be healed so that's perfect faith for the time notice now perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect faith masters all circumstances no matter what it is it matters it's probably god's standing there little bitty man i mean like five foot four weigh a hundred pounds and here comes this guy six four brother mom said yeah he could have picked me up and killed me right there crushed me but he didn't even step backwards he said satan come out of that man and he said that man fell at my feet he said they had to move him off my feet well that wasn't he was doing this he was standing in his ground because he had faith for the time he he that faith mastered all circumstances same way with you and i you and i got to stand one day and not start stumbling backwards stand up no matter what it is it matters now just watch when you believe anything do anything and you've got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstances that don't have one thing to do with it it masters that circumstance if it's in a room of sickness and the lord revealed that this certain thing is going to happen you just speak it and go on now he didn't say i he said you you say to this mountain not the preacher not the priest you say to this mountain oh does the just don't ask any questions it's already over why do we try to explain stuff away we do we're humans we try to explain everything it's already over just keep going it masters all circumstances paul daniel what did they do they didn't have to explain nothing paul didn't have to give him a 30-minute sermon on why the serpent did he just slung the thing off went right back to picking up wood he was a servant he was trying to get firebill for what them 200 people that were wet thank god for a servant like that daniel the same way daniel didn't say well now the lines are no the lines just sit down beside of him daniel knew by his prophet that he was coming out of captivity in two years see that's the faith we gotta have for a body change just like daniel when they lowered him down in that it was hey look from from from a from a uh television commentary well we're here today and daniel must have done something wrong because daniel is now oh look folks they're lowering him down into the oh listen to the lines you said what i'm talking about like today dramatize it all but they not they didn't see what happened because you know what a few days later they had to go back again and say well folks we're going to see bones today no they saw a man sat down there rubbing two cats remember how many it was why because faith master daniel said i can't die david says i cannot die until i sit on the throne go out doesn't matter cancer heartache troubles trials can't happen until i sit where that promise told me i was going to sit amen you take a promise and say i'm going to sit right here have faith for divine healing we pray for people it may be a week it may be a month it may take a doctor it may take an operation but you just have faith you just believe it's like dad's always said he said if i pass away he said don't put on my headstone i'm dead or that i didn't believe amen because you know what the people of the dark ages they died believing that that was the spirit of their age and that they come under that messenger they had and they died for it you and i but we got to have raptured faith we'll get to that a little bit later watch this right here god's commission this is 1953. we'll stop right here it didn't get to number 13 we'll get to it this afternoon brother brown says i have a great faith to believe that one day before the coming of the lord that all our little differences will be settled does the word of god have differences so i guess it must be that we can get back to the 100 word of god not man's ideas all right god may have to let communism looks like it now doesn't it communism sweep us together but something will take place that'll make us all one heart and in one accord if we can't have faith now for healing how are we going to have rapturing faith we've got to have faith for the little things first before the great things so there'll be something that'll cause that's in god's providence i do not know now i believe he knew later on i seen a demonstration of it recently because look at the look at the title of that sermon god commissioning moses and he was getting ready to tell the people his new commission instead of taking him by the hand he was going to tell them the secrets of their heart all right so he saw that i want a demonstration and that's what i want to tell you about james 1 verse 2 and i'm going to ask you this question and then we musicians go ahead and come my brother encountered all joy oh count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations many temptations everybody still believe the bible is right all right amen the bible's right okay my brethren counted all joy when you fall into this is the same james that's writing about this faith that works this is the same james is talking about all these other things that we're going to talk about tonight or this afternoon my brother encountered all joy when you fall into many temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith now it's yours it's not god's it's yours the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be what perfect and entire wanting nothing there's a question for you right there put your faith in what musicians come let's stand to our feet right here we'll read this and we'll start right here or we'll start back again faith takes its final resting place on the word of god that's where it finds its resting place you understand its resting place is on god's word that's where noah rested god said so that settles them that settles it so put your faith in the word of god please don't put your faith in a man don't put your faith in anything but the word of god don't put your faith in the church put your faith in the word of god all right we want to have faith in god because you know what but now see we have a church we have an organism here we have don't have an organization we have an organism we have piano players we have all these great musicians we have wonderful ministers and now we got an extra uh sunday school teacher and all these different things that's an organism that's the way we work and we saw that last weekend we saw that work but why did we do it did we do it because of brother joe just for an example he wasn't even there but did we did we do it just no we did it because we've been taught well by the word of god we've been taught well by the word of god take all the names out but we've been taught well by the word of god we can step in and do we can back up we can help this one over here we can back up all those different things are done because what's inside of you so your works expressed your faith we had faith in what we were doing last weekend we had faith for what we were doing today we had faith to get up and come to work come to church and come to work and do the things that we need to do here we come here to worship god and like i said before listen come here to learn don't come here to see so-and-so or or just cause brother wade told you to i i hope you don't do that but come here because you want to learn something from god and you don't want to just come and say well it's this sunday and then uh we got three more sundays and then it's next month and maybe we'll have somebody new that'll come in and preach better to us or something like that no hear from god how many of y'all stayed in kindergarten nobody moved to the first grade from the first grade to the second grade and we learned every year a little more then some of us went to college and boy we really learned stuff then a lot of bad stuff but we did learn some stuff and then like you know anna back there she's almost a she's almost dr roberts you get a degree i want a degree in the statue of a perfect man that's what i want to degree in because you know what we'll not have christ come back as the son of man until we do that right there until the body is fit together so the body is working as an organism so everything's working as a unit together brotherly love with charity godliness patience temperance and then what then brother brown said we'll read it several months from now he comes and caps it off that's what we want to do we want him to come and cap it off we want him to come and cap us off individually now not as a whole he comes as an individual i want him to sit down and seal that thing in and we're walking breathing prophet of god instrumentality of god let's sing a song god bless you [Music] i am blessed every day that i live i am blessed can you say that when i wake up in the morning when i lay my head to rest i am blessed sing it to him [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] through [Music] and his grace and sets me free and someday i shall stand by his [Music] [Applause] oh i am i am [Applause] when i wake up in the morning when i lay my head to rest i am i am blessed when i think about that song you

standing there he's going they're about ready to go to bed and then he gets reminded that over in the philippines they're getting ready to get up and all around the world the bride's laying our head down saying thank you god keep the devils off of me let me have a good night's rest but there's another group this alarm clock's going off at seven o'clock and they're jumping up and they're putting their feet on the floor and they're saying i'm blessed i am blessed when i wake up in the morning or when i lay my head to rest satan can't win he goes all the way around the world he keeps trying to keep up with us and he can't keep up with us because god just keeps waking the bride up all the way around the world oh what a god we serve oh i am blessed i am blessed for every day that i live i am
