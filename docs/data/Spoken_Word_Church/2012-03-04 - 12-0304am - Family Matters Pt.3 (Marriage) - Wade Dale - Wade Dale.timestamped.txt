[5:24] in our struggles to to Walk Through This
[5:27] World Lord we we know you you are in

[6:23] but Lord we pray that you just be with
[6:25] them probably give a strength bless this
[6:28] day
[6:28] you've already blessed your word Lord
[6:30] now blessed to our hearts in Jesus name
[6:32] we pray amen all right I'm going to read
[6:34] it out of the dog like and you read it
[6:36] off of the King James version
[6:40] Enlightenment or let wives be subject to
[6:42] their own husbands so that if some are
[6:45] disobedient
[6:47] to the word
[6:49] they may without a word be gained
[6:51] through the conduct of their wives
[6:54] yeah
[6:57] yeah conduct of their wives somebody can
[7:00] be converted yeah
[7:02] having seen your conduct chaste with
[7:05] fear
[7:07] whose decoration let it not be that
[7:09] external one of braiding the hair and
[7:11] putting on a gold chains or wearing of
[7:14] apparel
[7:15] but decorate the hidden land of the
[7:17] heart with what is incorruptible
[7:20] what is Incorruptible a Meek and quiet
[7:23] Spirit right which is very precious in
[7:25] the sight of God
[7:27] for this formerly also those holy women
[7:30] who hoped in God adorned themselves
[7:32] being subject to their own husband
[7:34] as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord
[7:37] whose children you are become
[7:39] doing good and not fearing any Terror
[7:42] and like man or husbands dwell according
[7:45] to knowledge with the female as the
[7:46] weaker vessel
[7:47] storing honor as being also joint heirs
[7:51] right of the gracious gift of life in
[7:54] order that your prayers
[7:56] may not be hindered amen the Lord has
[7:58] blessing to the reading of the word you
[8:00] can be seated
[8:01] and remember the theme part of this is
[8:03] that your prayers
[8:05] be not hindered amen our conduct toward
[8:08] our wives our conduct toward our husband
[8:11] can hinder our prayers is that right
[8:14] right
[8:15] that's true whether you believe it or
[8:18] not it's a Bible the Bible said it we
[8:21] believe it right so there it is it's the
[8:24] truth our prayers could be hindered by
[8:26] our very conduct
[8:27] of
[8:29] our everyday life amen right you know I
[8:33] um our preaching you know does does good
[8:37] but
[8:38] do you know our actions speak louder
[8:41] than any words that we that we utter so
[8:43] we think that uh that there's something
[8:46] to that that if we try to witness to
[8:49] somebody and and something stands in the
[8:52] way of us witnessing to them how good a
[8:54] witness are we right
[8:56] right if something we do right if the
[8:58] conduct that we do
[9:00] hinders somebody from being saved you
[9:03] know whose problem that is right amen do
[9:05] you know the Bible even says if you
[9:07] cause your wife to commit adultery right
[9:09] that she's not guilty you are
[9:13] you're guilty of making her commit
[9:15] advice pretty strong but why because of
[9:18] the double Covenant right man's the hand
[9:20] of the house period
[9:22] period right
[9:24] there's no co-equal right now right
[9:26] there was in the garden
[9:28] Adam and Eve I pulled up some uh a
[9:32] little thing on byproduct because I
[9:34] didn't cover it my wife was writing a
[9:36] couple of things down so this is kind of
[9:38] comical but I'll use it you know I
[9:40] always say you know we always say not to
[9:42] live a hound dog life unless one of
[9:44] brother Clark's favorite saying is you
[9:47] know if we leave a hound dog life then
[9:48] we ought not be Christians well leaving
[9:51] the hound dog life you know what a hound
[9:52] dog does
[9:53] Hound Dog's always hunting for something
[9:56] and that's what it is that's what I
[9:58] Hound all up you always hunt for
[9:59] something not settled let them go and
[10:01] then run out all over the woods and make
[10:04] a lot of noise yeah sometimes they find
[10:06] something yeah
[10:07] look at the byproduct
[10:10] he was a byproduct of Adam
[10:13] by product now listen to this
[10:16] my product is a secondary product
[10:18] derived from a manufacturing process or
[10:22] chemical reaction
[10:23] it is not the primary product or service
[10:25] being produced right listen to this
[10:29] this is need
[10:30] a byproduct can be useful and marketable
[10:36] or it can be considered waste right
[10:40] but look at some of the examples
[10:42] molasses is good right
[10:44] it's only sugar
[10:46] so molasses is a byproduct of sugar it's
[10:48] not a lesser product
[10:51] it's molasses
[10:53] but it's defined or refined from sugar
[10:56] asphalt
[10:58] is not lower form than crude oil
[11:01] it's just a byproduct right of the
[11:04] process
[11:05] mineral from refried and crude oil to
[11:07] produce gasoline yeah
[11:10] and of course we get salt from
[11:11] desalinization
[11:14] right so salt is not a salt is not a is
[11:18] not a lower form of the salt that's in
[11:20] the sea and what it's just something
[11:23] happened to do what
[11:25] separate it yeah so that it can be what
[11:28] used right all right I see a byproduct
[11:31] can be useful and marketable
[11:33] or it can be considered waste that's why
[11:35] my brother rounds in a woman can be what
[11:37] the greatest thing that a man can have
[11:39] besides salvation or she can be what
[11:41] water in your blood right so she can be
[11:45] both
[11:46] and Men You're not far from that
[11:49] right you can be useful or you can be
[11:52] waste right but Eve being a byproduct of
[11:55] Adam she was not a lesser form than Adam
[11:59] this is before the fall in the beginning
[12:02] when we were talking about this kind of
[12:03] review a little bit about them being
[12:05] co-equal they became co-equal when Eve
[12:09] come out of Adam right didn't make her a
[12:11] less reform she was just a byproduct
[12:13] something else to be used in the
[12:16] refining of Adam
[12:19] everything
[12:20] in the refining of Adam Eve came right
[12:23] not unless reform right
[12:26] but to enhance Adam
[12:29] Eve came out Amen to enhance sugar
[12:33] molasses comes out yeah you see what I'm
[12:36] saying about a byproduct so a byproduct
[12:38] is not dog meat like most people in the
[12:40] message preach that that man was you
[12:43] know like that he said man was ribeye
[12:45] steak and and woman was was some kind of
[12:47] tribe or something or oxtail no
[12:50] no I haven't even co-equal right I read
[12:54] you there in verse 7 and Peter he
[12:55] doesn't say it in the in the King James
[12:58] version but it does in the in the
[13:00] emphatic dying lot it tells you that
[13:02] they're we're going back to being joint
[13:03] heirs amen
[13:05] all right join air but what happened was
[13:08] from the fall in the Garden of Eden it
[13:12] brought forth a double Covenant right
[13:14] right all right now that double Covenant
[13:17] was because number one remember Adam
[13:20] began to be fearful remember it says in
[13:23] there in Genesis it says I was afraid
[13:25] right that totally right there started
[13:28] breaking the fellowship from God he
[13:30] never was afraid before Adam and Eve
[13:32] could walk up
[13:34] right up to God face to face with no
[13:36] clothes on
[13:38] and just as pure as the day they were
[13:40] formed man right okay but when what
[13:44] happened in the garden it didn't say
[13:47] that Eve was afraid because she really
[13:48] thought she was doing the right thing
[13:50] but Adam knew
[13:53] remember we're talking about iniquity
[13:54] we'll get into that when we get into let
[13:57] your prayers be not hindered would you
[13:59] be just you know a little bit later
[14:01] foreign
[14:02] but Eve Was Not Afraid Adam was afraid
[14:05] right out of that we're out now
[14:08] I was naked and I was
[14:10] afraid right
[14:12] what he was afraid to approach God
[14:14] because he had done what iniquity right
[14:16] and then it says in the last days that
[14:18] the iniquity will abound the love of
[14:20] many that's what we're going to talk
[14:21] about today love a love of many shall
[14:24] wax cold
[14:25] but the double Covenant though bringing
[14:28] the two apart what does it do it
[14:30] enhanced I am
[14:33] you've enhanced at them by coming out we
[14:35] were talking about fellowship and about
[14:37] the vows and how that devours what
[14:39] marries you not any other act past that
[14:41] of the bounds is what marries you all
[14:44] right and we'll read another quote in
[14:46] here that I'll I'll uh I'll read you a
[14:49] little bit later on talking about love
[14:51] that he tells that God brought Adam and
[14:55] Eve together and married them
[14:57] and they were husband and wife and that
[14:59] was before the fall right
[15:01] okay so it wasn't a sex act that made it
[15:03] makes you married it's your vow right
[15:05] it's what comes from here remember it's
[15:07] a spoken word we can't stay with a
[15:08] spoken word amen right all right so
[15:10] that's the original way it should have
[15:11] been but the double Covenant restores
[15:13] order of headship and fellowship it does
[15:16] cause we put man here he used to be head
[15:19] over the woman but to be in that order
[15:22] is to restore everything back to where
[15:24] it's supposed to be Manny all right now
[15:28] and it also does what it gives us a way
[15:31] back right without Eve Adam couldn't
[15:35] reproduce yourself right
[15:37] we know it happens sexually
[15:40] that was permissive of God permissive
[15:42] will to get us here exactly but coming
[15:44] out of that Jesus was born from the womb
[15:47] to bring us back into what Fellowship
[15:49] amen says in Romans 8 for us to be heirs
[15:52] and join heirs with who
[15:56] y'all sleep
[15:59] join Ayers with thank you
[16:02] I know some of you may not want to be
[16:04] yeah don't sound like it
[16:09] but anyway
[16:11] no Covenant
[16:13] so now what's happening is if men we're
[16:15] gonna we're gonna go back through this
[16:17] now if men will act like men another
[16:19] brand I'm saying women would act like
[16:20] women
[16:21] will come back under that Fellowship
[16:23] right where Christ is our head our head
[16:28] because then we're all feminist in the
[16:30] body and spirituality right all of us
[16:33] are and to get back what we what do we
[16:36] have to do we got to reproduce the head
[16:37] amen
[16:39] without Eve haven't couldn't reproduce
[16:42] yourselves right amen so without the
[16:44] church the bride we can't reproduce
[16:47] Christ so when he split them apart he
[16:49] didn't do a disservice that's what
[16:50] brother Randall said because I didn't do
[16:52] a dessert disservice or that wasn't this
[16:54] complementary to God no it was part of
[16:57] the plan right for us to be feminist the
[17:00] bride amen knew we were going to fall to
[17:02] give us a a choice
[17:05] and so that God could be a savior A
[17:07] Healer a redeemer and all those things
[17:10] right because that's what he was he had
[17:11] those attributes he couldn't get rid of
[17:13] them
[17:14] right he had to display him because he
[17:15] was gone man right so he had to display
[17:18] him by not leaving one man because
[17:21] remember creation was over at the sixth
[17:24] day Man was created on Sixth Day right
[17:25] exactly okay so he couldn't create a
[17:28] woman
[17:31] creation was over right
[17:34] he just took a part of salt right oh
[17:38] part of salt water and made salt out of
[17:40] it yeah
[17:41] took a part of Adam and made another
[17:43] part of it
[17:45] not a lesser form but now when we come
[17:48] to where in the Garden of Eden where she
[17:49] did what she did she lost her she lost
[17:52] her co-equalness with God she lost her
[17:55] co-equalness with her husband and and
[17:58] God said since you did what you did we
[18:00] remember we read the the double Covenant
[18:02] there in Genesis three we're not going
[18:03] to read it again for time
[18:05] but then God said okay we got a double
[18:08] Covenant remember last Sunday the double
[18:10] Covenant
[18:11] God is here actually it's a triple
[18:14] Covenant yeah it's god making a covenant
[18:17] with us and then us having a covenant
[18:19] with a woman but let's stay with the
[18:20] double Covenant because brother Brown
[18:21] preached on the double Covenant right
[18:23] Right double Covenant is
[18:25] that we were here
[18:28] we were here now we're here man has
[18:31] rulership over the female because of
[18:33] what happened in the garden right but in
[18:36] doing that
[18:37] that's going to restore his men will
[18:39] stay where they're at women stay where
[18:40] they're at God's gonna run this thing
[18:42] right back around and we're going to go
[18:44] right back into eternity yeah
[18:47] man and woman and be right back where we
[18:50] were had there not been a fall all right
[18:52] exactly now men would act like men and
[18:54] women act like women we will be able to
[18:56] have fellowship and relationship with
[18:58] each other in the Lord
[19:01] yeah all right we're gonna find out
[19:03] today without
[19:05] you and your spouse both having a new
[19:08] birth I'm just gonna let brother Brown
[19:10] because you'll think I'm you think I'm
[19:12] hard on people you're going to let you
[19:13] read what brother but we'll put some
[19:14] quotes up here
[19:15] but now look you get back to where we
[19:19] were going
[19:21] this is going to be a fellowship though
[19:23] based on love God knows that the love of
[19:25] God was was agape love and
[19:28] and if you pull it up now remember what
[19:30] we did a couple weeks ago about
[19:33] um agape love
[19:35] now this is just kind of my definition
[19:37] but it should be doing just well as far
[19:40] as the others Agape Love Is the Love of
[19:43] God right right brother Brown called it
[19:45] Divine love or perfect love exactly all
[19:47] right that's the baptism of the Holy
[19:48] Ghost that's the new birth right but now
[19:50] look when I read this in in Ephesians
[19:54] when it says husband love your wife
[19:57] look in the original
[20:00] it's not filio
[20:02] right everything in the New Testament
[20:04] remember I told you all right you got to
[20:06] remember in the Old Testament it was it
[20:09] was lower form of love
[20:12] it wasn't agape love right not till
[20:14] Jesus come and says love your brother
[20:16] that don't mean love him and feel your
[20:17] love that means love him with agape love
[20:19] right all right
[20:21] so that's what husbands love your wife
[20:23] so let's look at this and not Beloved
[20:24] the love of God Divine love perfect love
[20:26] that was what was in the Garden of Eden
[20:28] right
[20:29] period
[20:31] yeah
[20:34] Adam didn't love woman
[20:37] with feel your love in the garden before
[20:39] the fall exactly
[20:42] but Satan knew he could take what God
[20:45] had perfected
[20:46] amen agape love amen perfected that
[20:50] that's perfect that's Divine love of God
[20:52] perfect love
[20:53] has no other
[20:55] um
[20:56] form
[20:58] and Satan said okay I can make these two
[21:00] do this and I can make them do this what
[21:03] did Brother Brown say he said remember
[21:04] he said you take a you take a woman and
[21:06] she was a street walker went went to a
[21:09] what flapper goes to a prostitute
[21:12] horde all the way down well that's what
[21:14] that's what Satan was doing he took
[21:16] agape love because that's what we're
[21:17] going back to Glory
[21:20] We're Not Gonna feel your love for our
[21:21] wife in the Millennium right right
[21:23] surely not the other two yeah
[21:27] but what Satan has he knew that in agape
[21:30] love was these other characteristics
[21:34] so we come down now we have filial love
[21:36] which is a love between a husband and a
[21:38] wife amen amen natural love
[21:40] Eros which is sexual Central or Lush
[21:44] our storage which is a love between
[21:46] family because see a parent can't love a
[21:48] child in
[21:50] Philly or or the other one better not be
[21:53] because see that's perverted right see I
[21:54] say it's perverted all that and brought
[21:56] it down and it's just a it's just a
[21:58] snowball effect with Satan right you
[22:01] take agape love which is pure and
[22:02] perfect have you ever took a snowball
[22:05] beautiful snowball
[22:07] lay it down and roll it
[22:09] it gets bigger but what happened it gets
[22:11] dirtier
[22:12] because it picks up all the junk unless
[22:14] you you know unless your nose is high
[22:15] when it snows around here it's only
[22:17] about that deep for those that are on
[22:18] the internet so we'll start a
[22:20] snowballing his pure and white but by
[22:21] the time we roll it down the hill make a
[22:23] snowball it's got glass it's got grass
[22:25] clods and and
[22:27] if you live in a field somewhere you
[22:29] know what the other person does well see
[22:32] that's why Satan done he knew that agape
[22:34] love was the love of God he couldn't he
[22:36] cannot imitate that
[22:38] exactly but he can bring it down and
[22:42] imitate it to a way of bringing it down
[22:44] to hey love for spouse
[22:47] sensual lover sexual lover lust and then
[22:50] love between family yeah
[22:52] if you keep that separate that's not so
[22:55] bad
[22:56] because that's the way we live hey
[22:58] without number three we wouldn't be
[22:59] sitting here today right exactly
[23:02] come on please right but what what is it
[23:05] doing if you took that and put it on a
[23:07] roll and rolled it back up
[23:10] you do away with storage Eros feel your
[23:13] love and all you have was adopt me love
[23:15] the love of God that's what we're going
[23:17] back to the love of God when but now
[23:19] what's going to happen God is so good
[23:21] I'm gonna read your quote where brother
[23:22] random said we drop down here in time
[23:24] pick his spouse up took it right back up
[23:26] into eternity right
[23:29] exactly
[23:31] hey some things that that we got to
[23:33] understand that we might not all be some
[23:36] people might not be single when they're
[23:38] over there we may have we may be going
[23:39] to somebody
[23:44] it wasn't Adam by itself
[23:47] exactly it was Adam and Eve right or
[23:50] woman I'm gonna call her e but you know
[23:52] what I'm talking about
[23:53] all right so what's happening now in the
[23:56] double Covenant
[23:57] these other lungs come into effect but
[24:00] it's all got to go back to if you don't
[24:02] have agape love then look what's going
[24:04] to happen
[24:05] anybody can love you I saw in the paper
[24:07] today where somebody was married for 50
[24:09] years and around here in Gainesville
[24:12] what you find brother then y'all been
[24:14] married how long 57 57 years
[24:17] but now see you've got people that's not
[24:19] born again that love each other
[24:22] truly love that's this love yep
[24:27] only this love can be born again love so
[24:29] don't worry about that you live together
[24:31] fifteen hundred thousand years it really
[24:33] doesn't matter if you don't have this
[24:34] part of you it's just fill your love and
[24:37] it'll go away
[24:39] this right here you have it every day
[24:43] and same with this love between the
[24:44] family parents and children but see
[24:46] that's not what this is why it's not
[24:48] going to happen when we give in glory
[24:49] right but still brother Brown said you
[24:51] will have a spouse you'll know that you
[24:54] brought forth children you'll know who
[24:55] you brought forth and I'll read you a
[24:57] quote maybe the night where he says the
[24:59] family no I'm going to wait and do that
[25:01] with a family but he said the family
[25:02] will be together in heaven amen that's
[25:05] where you believe for your family right
[25:06] believe for your family your family will
[25:09] be there with you in heaven so let's
[25:10] roll this back up because this what's
[25:13] going to happen is we're still living in
[25:15] the world so these are still going to be
[25:16] part of my life right yeah
[25:18] but we're heading back toward the love
[25:21] of God and
[25:23] inside of us that's where it is but we
[25:26] still have to deal with these things in
[25:28] our in our married life
[25:30] all these other three happen every day
[25:33] right
[25:34] but remember they're just temporary or
[25:37] temporal
[25:39] this is the only thing that's going to
[25:40] last for an eternity this is the only
[25:42] thing it's Eternal these will pass away
[25:44] right but we got to still deal with them
[25:46] and live in them
[25:48] so we gotta learn to deal with them and
[25:50] I believe God give us a way to deal with
[25:52] I don't believe
[25:54] that he just threw this thing out here
[25:56] and said here live the live the way you
[25:58] can
[25:59] no he gave us an order that's why he put
[26:01] mail females right
[26:04] he knew you would take this the the more
[26:07] of the the sensual side or the emotional
[26:09] side because that was already an atom
[26:12] he just separated that on into another
[26:15] person called Eve
[26:16] everybody okay with it amen
[26:19] but he started in the garden with agape
[26:21] love
[26:22] but it was deluded by Satan into these
[26:25] other forms of love
[26:27] really all love is permissive except for
[26:30] agape love
[26:31] right all right I'm just reading my
[26:33] notes off again there's a love of God in
[26:36] our heart so if we're born again all
[26:38] these other forms are temporary
[26:40] that is why people with agape love will
[26:42] seek a mate and find true love amen
[26:45] right right listen to this now without a
[26:49] gump in love the motives are motivation
[26:51] for marriage and we're talking about
[26:53] marriage now this is part three on
[26:55] marriage we're talking about love
[26:56] without a Godly love the motives are
[26:58] motivation for marriage is one sexual
[27:01] desire
[27:02] two
[27:04] romantic feelings
[27:06] three good looks

[28:00] they're trying to do we're trying to do
[28:02] the best we can
[28:03] but God give us a way though and we'll
[28:06] talk about that in the families where
[28:07] the husband and wife should sit down and
[28:09] and talk to your children
[28:11] brother Joe Canada and sister Rachel
[28:13] does a really good job is you know
[28:15] talking to their kids about the Lord and
[28:17] praying with them and and we'll cover
[28:19] that but but that's what we should do if
[28:22] we got away from it so much to where we
[28:23] just stick the kids somewhere and and
[28:25] you know don't pray with them and pray
[28:27] for them and and what do we you know
[28:29] what are we doing we become so busy you
[28:31] know Satan has made us busy oh yeah he's

[29:18] thank you even this Christ also love the
[29:21] church and gave himself for it that love
[29:23] is not filling your love right if you
[29:25] look in your original that love is a god
[29:27] below all of you New Testament when it
[29:29] talks about love it talks about agape
[29:31] love which is the love of God all right
[29:33] now let's go to Titus two and four
[29:36] listen to this
[29:39] that they may teach the young women to
[29:42] be sober to love their husbands to love
[29:44] their children

[29:49] that sober don't mean
[29:51] get out of the liquor closet we'll we'll
[29:55] cover that when we cover the women but
[29:56] I'm telling you we're going to use some
[29:58] of these scriptures twice or three times
[30:01] but we're talking about marriage today
[30:03] between the husband and wife all right
[30:04] we're not separating we're keeping them

[30:42] I'm being serious here these quotes I'm
[30:45] pulling off because of the way we act
[30:47] right if you love your wife you've just
[30:50] got to get with her and talk with her

[31:09] believe our prophet that's what he's
[31:11] telling you
[31:12] if you love your friend you've got to
[31:14] get with him and talk to him and if you
[31:16] love God there's got to be a basis of
[31:17] Fellowship you cannot have complete
[31:20] fellowship and out what
[31:24] livelihood right

[31:36] excuse me you cannot be married without
[31:39] an agreement right you cannot have a
[31:41] wife without some kind of an agreement
[31:44] amen and that agreement is based upon
[31:48] your vow right back to last Sunday
[31:51] you're about what you
[31:53] what you said when you were standing at
[31:55] the altar
[31:57] that's your vow until death do us part

[32:49] a liar if he didn't right that's right
[32:51] amen that's right he told a lie he
[32:53] absolutely in his heart very heart he
[32:56] loved his wife so much he didn't care
[32:57] how big she got or how much hair she
[32:59] lost it man because it has to be
[33:01] something there that you have to has to
[33:04] have to meet
[33:06] that you love somebody
[33:08] what something you have to meet what God
[33:10] right that you love somebody unless that
[33:13] person loves another person
[33:15] keep scrolling this is for you young
[33:17] girls it's not married and you boys see
[33:19] when you meet that girl that you love
[33:21] and there's something you know you love
[33:23] her and that's just all there is to it
[33:25] or you love him and that you don't care
[33:27] whether he's handsome or whether he's
[33:29] not handsome or whether she's pretty or
[33:32] not pretty that doesn't matter
[33:34] but you love them just the same now you
[33:37] better watch kind of hold around close
[33:38] there because you're getting close to
[33:40] home there and a marriage based outside
[33:42] of this is sure to fall
[33:44] or it'll never be successful they'll
[33:48] never be happy right all right now
[33:50] number three
[33:52] foreign
[33:55] this
[33:57] is in the masterpiece 1964.
[34:02] am I getting in the way just treat it
[34:04] here today so I don't have to worry
[34:05] about it
[34:06] Pretty Tony said she looked at the back
[34:08] of my head and when she did a quote so
[34:10] notice the Great Masterpiece of the
[34:13] family the husband and wife
[34:14] truly a
[34:17] has to be if they're not they're not a
[34:21] good family life pulling one way and the
[34:23] husband pulling another that would make
[34:25] an awful family but in agreement look
[34:28] how many times he uses the word
[34:29] agreement right
[34:32] that's not argument
[34:35] right it's felt different
[34:39] the last four is Right meant yeah
[34:42] but it's agreement
[34:44] not argument
[34:46] with love one to the other that's a
[34:49] family now that was God's Masterpiece
[34:51] and now all the true family here
[34:54] portrays that see and now the
[34:57] Masterpiece family has come again Christ
[34:58] in his pride ready to come the second
[35:01] Adam second e who is us right
[35:03] now are you spiritualized which is okay
[35:05] ready now to return back to their home
[35:07] and the whole picture has been what
[35:09] Redemption right amen from where it was
[35:15] bringing it back see just exactly
[35:17] bringing it back again what back to
[35:20] fellowship all right now let's go to
[35:22] number four
[35:26] now listen to this
[35:30] love should govern the home
[35:32] love is the greatest force that was ever
[35:34] put in the power of a man
[35:37] a home that's not
[35:39] discipline there's one word
[35:41] a home that's not disciplined
[35:46] okay if it's disciplined then
[35:51] if you're
[35:53] daughters cutting her hair
[35:56] you got a discipline her yeah
[35:59] these signs walking around here with his
[36:01] hair over his ears it's not my job to
[36:03] discipline them it's uh yours right a
[36:07] home that's not disciplined by love is
[36:09] not much of a home
[36:10] if the husband and wife doesn't solemnly
[36:13] love each other they cannot trust each
[36:15] other
[36:16] what is that fear
[36:19] right now look at this
[36:21] now love is in two different words two
[36:23] different meanings in the Greek one of
[36:25] them is called filial that's the love
[36:26] that you have for your wife
[36:28] I've got the love it's love divine love
[36:30] now the love that you have for your wife
[36:32] and the love of God Is So contrary yeah
[36:38] not contrary
[36:40] just listen to this right the love that
[36:42] you have for your wife if a man would
[36:44] insult her you'd kill him on the spot
[36:46] with that kind of love I'll feel your
[36:47] love
[36:49] cause and feel your love you can have
[36:51] jealousy and you can have all these
[36:52] different things but with agape love
[36:54] there's one thing
[36:55] it's love
[36:57] not disagreement
[36:59] not anything else but a God we love you
[37:01] pray for his lost soul that'd be the
[37:03] difference there's two different types
[37:04] of love and I'm almost sure that many of
[37:06] us
[37:07] has been deceived with having filial
[37:10] love and thinking it's agape love right
[37:12] right billion love is
[37:15] intellectual right
[37:18] agape love comes from the heart right
[37:21] that's human love affectionate love and
[37:23] godly love Godly love does a question
[37:27] human love reason
[37:29] but Godly love doesn't
[37:31] it's perfect in its Trust
[37:34] it produces
[37:37] faith when you really love right see how
[37:41] important it is to even love your wife
[37:43] it actually produces Faith amen right
[37:45] right Crush all right all those great
[37:48] things there all right number five
[37:52] hey singing I love him I love him
[37:55] because you first love me love love him
[37:58] see what he done for you brother random
[38:01] continues humming I love him it's my
[38:03] love look at this now
[38:06] love brings obedience
[38:11] husbands love your wife I just read the
[38:13] scripture right love brings obedience
[38:16] love brings courtship love brings
[38:20] marriage and that's where we're headed
[38:24] marriage supper of the Lamb all right
[38:26] everybody got that love man obedience
[38:29] courtship
[38:31] married now we're talking about marriage
[38:33] now because 90 of us that in here are
[38:35] married so I thought about starting with
[38:38] that and then going in the other
[38:39] direction back toward the courtship
[38:41] because you know most of our courtships
[38:43] are I don't want to say over but we
[38:46] found our spouse so the courtship part
[38:49] is over but the honeymoon part shouldn't
[38:51] be
[38:59] number six
[39:03] we should be happy about this folks this
[39:06] is where we live
[39:10] I'm happy with my wife amen and I don't
[39:13] care who knows it
[39:16] I'm happy with my salvation and don't
[39:18] care who knows if you're not happy with
[39:20] your wife I doubt you're happy with your
[39:22] salvation oh
[39:24] I'll let brother brown man for that in
[39:26] just a few minutes
[39:27] I'm getting ahead of my notes listen to
[39:30] this right here now this is a really
[39:31] good one the kingsman Redeemer 1960.
[39:34] yesterday morning we were laying in bed
[39:36] a little late
[39:39] they were talking
[39:43] oh sorry
[39:46] and the kids didn't have to go to school
[39:48] and we got speaking about different
[39:49] things
[39:53] what was hatred I said hatred had a
[39:57] beginning so it has to have an end love
[39:59] had no beginning
[40:00] so it has no end
[40:03] hatred is forever
[40:05] love is eternal hatred begins and hatred
[40:08] will end
[40:09] love never did begin and it never will
[40:13] end right
[40:14] right it's Eternal and When a Man Loves
[40:16] a Woman
[40:17] and marries her because she's just
[40:20] pretty they'll be an end to that right
[40:26] that's right amen right now being into
[40:29] that right
[40:31] and let's just be honest a lot of you
[40:33] that's been married before and ended up
[40:35] something
[40:36] ow but truth anyhow
[40:39] When a Man Loves a Woman and marries her
[40:41] because she's just pretty they'll be an
[40:42] end to that but when a man finds a woman
[40:45] that he loves
[40:47] he don't know why
[40:49] but he loves her
[40:50] and she finds the man that she loves no
[40:53] matter what he looks like
[40:56] he loves her she loves him
[40:59] that's an eternal mate in glory right
[41:03] man they all death nor nothing else can
[41:06] ever separate them because they are from
[41:09] eternity and not the people but the
[41:11] eternal life they have
[41:13] right but God's not going to take
[41:15] eternal life and if you're joined one as
[41:17] a male and female on Earth you two
[41:20] become what
[41:22] and what God joined together let no man
[41:25] put us under right because they are from
[41:28] eternity and they step into out into the
[41:32] space of time right here
[41:34] and we'll return back to Eternity
[41:37] eternity has dropped down in a body
[41:39] called time then it goes right back up
[41:42] into eternity again it cannot perish
[41:44] amen
[41:46] no Amen to that right
[41:49] Amen to that
[41:50] I'm gonna read that one more time
[41:54] hatred begins and hatred will end right
[41:58] love agape love never did begin and it
[42:01] never will end it's eternal
[42:04] you see the Eternal quality that he's
[42:06] bringing in here it's an eternal quality
[42:08] it's not just all these other emotions
[42:10] that we have for our families down here
[42:12] all those other loves that we talked
[42:14] about no he's talking about the great
[42:16] agape love When a Man Loves a Woman and
[42:18] marries her because she's just pretty
[42:20] they'll get into that right
[42:22] but when a man finds a woman that he
[42:24] loves he don't know why
[42:27] you'll find out why right but you don't
[42:30] know why first
[42:32] and she finds the man that she loved no
[42:34] matter what he looks like
[42:36] he loves her she loves him
[42:39] that's an eternal made in glory amen
[42:42] they are death nor nothing else can ever
[42:45] separate them
[42:48] now look folks if you can't look at your
[42:50] spouse right now and say that to her and
[42:52] she say that to you right
[42:55] we got some work to do amen listen work
[42:58] to do people
[43:00] because that's what the prophet told us
[43:02] because they are from eternity and they
[43:04] stepped out into time
[43:06] a space of time and return back to
[43:08] Eternity
[43:09] eternity has dropped down in a body call
[43:11] time this body
[43:13] then it goes right back up into eternity
[43:15] again it cannot
[43:17] perish all right amen it was a lot of
[43:21] applications to that right a lot of
[43:23] applications to that but husbands
[43:25] love your wives amen
[43:28] love learn agape love if you learn that
[43:33] all those other three loves will come in
[43:35] line yeah yeah without the first one
[43:40] you got a bunch of junk that's right
[43:44] I lived in a bunch of junk without
[43:47] me loved right you lived in a bunch of
[43:50] junk right without a coffee love right
[43:52] but what did the coffee love do he
[43:54] brought you in line
[43:56] to where you can truly I'm gonna read
[43:58] your quote in a few minutes brother
[43:59] Brown said only the bride in the end
[44:01] time won't know anything about love
[44:02] nobody this whole world can write books
[44:05] and look I appreciate sister Anna and
[44:06] all y'all sending me stuff about this
[44:08] but if a prophet didn't say about love
[44:10] and the Bible didn't say enough about
[44:11] love I don't want to hear anybody else's
[44:13] comment about love right okay I don't
[44:15] want to hear nobody else only a
[44:17] born-again person is supposed to tell me
[44:19] about love amen
[44:21] man I'm not being hard but I'm being
[44:22] hard
[44:23] right I don't want to hear all these
[44:25] other things I want to know what brother
[44:27] Brown said
[44:28] he's the one right he's an absolute
[44:30] right he's our absolute his first one he
[44:33] brought not him as person but this is
[44:34] our absolute what he said right
[44:37] so you know you can read these self-help
[44:39] books and that's okay
[44:41] the light brother Brown said what does
[44:43] it roll from does it roll from from from
[44:47] uh denominational thought about love
[44:49] where you can divorce and do all those
[44:50] other things
[44:53] tell me where true love is right it's
[44:55] only in the people of this message that
[44:57] know what's going on without that making
[44:59] divorce him married 15 times they just
[45:01] take the word of God and just shred it
[45:03] up and throw it away
[45:05] the only true love is what we know in
[45:07] this message right here exactly right
[45:08] now and then with the baptism of the
[45:11] Holy Ghost we connect to that right
[45:15] we connect back to this that's what that
[45:17] Holy Ghost is doing it's pointing you to
[45:19] that it's not pointing you to anything
[45:21] else right it's okay to do that but what
[45:24] are you going to do you're gonna Satan
[45:26] will take that Satan will take a uh
[45:29] somebody that really loves each other
[45:30] and then then you flip it down and and
[45:32] you come down to the brother man talks
[45:34] about the more true love story books
[45:36] then all my children and as the stomach
[45:38] turns and all those you know those
[45:40] things those
[45:41] um
[45:42] he said all my children so that's what
[45:44] they had they had all them all their
[45:46] children
[45:48] the women bro we had all them feelings
[45:51] but what did that do you know what that
[45:53] done brother random you know I Love Lucy
[45:55] was on on Wednesday night
[45:58] number one it kept people out of church
[46:00] yeah
[46:01] but number two it was the first time a
[46:03] camera was put in a bedroom yep but they
[46:06] were fully clothed and on loose pajamas
[46:10] separate beds and said good night and
[46:12] turn the light off who knows how Ricky
[46:15] got made
[46:16] but somewhere in there again
[46:19] but see that was innocent but was that
[46:22] what was that like brother Claus said
[46:24] that was a saying that went forth right
[46:25] right it's okay to do this it's okay to
[46:28] show this to the world yeah then what
[46:30] happened to that then you the then the
[46:32] uh soap operas was the next thing to
[46:34] come up
[46:39] then look what you got two clicks on a
[46:42] computer you got pornography so see what
[46:44] that went from I Love Lucy
[46:46] but see the profit the prophet could see
[46:49] with his Prophet eyes he could see what
[46:52] that was going to in fact you and I
[46:54] didn't so we have to depend on what he
[46:57] said right
[46:58] right to lead us when you said well
[46:59] that's not so bad that's not well no it
[47:02] wasn't at the time but what is it going
[47:04] to right what is it leading us to oh
[47:07] it's okay for us to stay at home and
[47:09] listen to the internet we don't have to
[47:11] go to church now we got it on the
[47:12] internet
[47:13] what's Satan done right right sorry I
[47:16] know the ones you can't get here it's
[47:18] okay
[47:19] but the ones that can get here
[47:22] and I love sister Trudy she may not
[47:24] think I do but they don't love her
[47:26] because she's going to be a witness for
[47:28] for how far from your house
[47:30] from your house to here
[47:33] 249 miles a circle of this church
[47:38] yep
[47:39] I'm not talking about just from
[47:41] Charlotte down to here
[47:43] you know what I'm talking about
[47:46] it's like a radar screen
[47:49] 249 miles from this church
[47:53] she's a witness yeah right when somebody
[47:56] stays home because their cat gets sick
[47:58] yeah
[48:00] or their dogs got diarrhea
[48:02] or or they got a toothache yeah sister
[48:05] 2D drives that whole 249 miles so allow
[48:08] the whole radius of this church
[48:10] if you don't make it to church there's
[48:12] your witness right one woman
[48:16] yeah
[48:17] she's not a preacher she wasn't a man
[48:18] right
[48:20] but she's got a great ministry amen it
[48:22] reaches 249 miles right in a circle
[48:26] I look at little details like that I
[48:30] look at those little things because
[48:31] that's what God does God put somebody in
[48:33] a community brother around said put a
[48:35] woman in the community to pray and read
[48:36] her Bible remember the success of the
[48:38] Chicago meeting was because of two women
[48:40] going to their closets and praying right
[48:43] for the success of that meeting two
[48:45] women remember the baptism of the Holy
[48:48] Ghost is bringing us back to here
[48:52] right
[48:54] because according to my Bible we're to
[48:56] be join heirs with Christ and that's set
[48:58] the new birth
[49:00] but now Sister remember we're still
[49:01] under the double Covenant so don't think
[49:03] you can
[49:04] we'll cover that in the one with the
[49:06] woman we're heading back to that place
[49:08] but as long as we're in time you've
[49:10] still got the double Covenant right
[49:12] still got the mail still got the female
[49:13] underneath all right
[49:16] everybody understand that amen but with
[49:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:19] sure I'm only gonna feel a woman can
[49:22] help you but she has a position she
[49:24] doesn't have this position right your
[49:26] sisters ought to think God you don't
[49:27] have to get up here and every soul in
[49:30] the world hanging on what you say that's
[49:31] right
[49:33] what did Jacob say when he called that
[49:35] place Bethel he said it's a horrible
[49:37] place a terrible Place why because
[49:40] here's where judgment begins here's
[49:42] where judgment begins Glory right not
[49:44] judges me first and then brings it to
[49:46] you right
[49:47] all right now let's turn to Corinthians
[49:49] First Corinthians
[49:51] 13.
[49:52] now we read this
[49:55] and we read this at the marriage
[49:58] enrichment and they the NIV version is
[50:01] is a little bit more simpler but let's
[50:04] read this one because charity is love
[50:06] right right
[50:08] all right let's talk about love for just
[50:09] a few minutes I'm not we're not we're
[50:10] going to go to this till till I find a
[50:12] place to stop and it may not be but
[50:14] another 10 minutes but that's okay we're
[50:16] gonna we're gonna cover these things and
[50:18] just kind of let you chew on them a
[50:19] little bit love suffereth long right
[50:24] in other words not quick temper
[50:28] in other words not Quint tempered
[50:30] amen thank you
[50:33] and it's what kind yeah love
[50:38] there's no jealousy right that seem to
[50:41] be right there's no jealousy in love and
[50:44] we're talking about agape love here
[50:45] we're not talking about remember that
[50:47] filter's down right right if you have
[50:50] agape love you can understand these
[50:52] things now I'm not saying you're going
[50:53] to do them all every day we're not a
[50:54] walking zombie we have problems in our
[50:56] life all right
[50:58] but look it charity vaulteth not itself
[51:03] let me put that in in 2012 words
[51:08] charity is not self-centered right I I
[51:12] mean me that's what causes a lot of
[51:15] divorce in the world today
[51:17] me

[52:16] quote in just a minute Rejoice is not an
[52:19] iniquity we do not rejoice when somebody

[53:23] we can bring in a lot of scriptures here
[53:25] but we won't but let's go ahead and
[53:26] let's bring in uh
[53:28] quote number seven
[53:33] listen to this I
[53:36] think Christ's revealed and don't work
[53:37] 1965. I've been this week down in the
[53:39] country staying with some very dear
[53:41] friends I asked someone at the table
[53:43] yesterday when we was eating we always
[53:45] sit around have a little little study on
[53:46] the Bible
[53:47] we was talking about love
[53:50] now they're talking about love get the
[53:52] story
[53:53] but look what comes out of it
[53:56] and there was a certain person said to
[53:57] me I believe you're Antichrist
[54:03] I'd like to you know what
[54:04] brother Brown didn't get up and give him
[54:06] a last hook across the table yeah
[54:09] I said if that would be pleasing to my
[54:11] Lord that's what I want to be
[54:13] I want to be whatever he wants me to be
[54:15] I love him if he should cast me into
[54:17] hell all right I still will love him if
[54:20] I go with the same spirit I have now
[54:22] right
[54:24] say we can say that right we can say you
[54:26] can cast me into hell I'll still love
[54:28] you and may not mean it but he said if I
[54:30] go with the same spirit I have now in
[54:32] other words nothing welled up inside of
[54:34] him nothing was against this man that
[54:36] says I believe you're Antichrist I don't
[54:38] believe there was nothing in that man
[54:39] that he envied that man or or did
[54:42] anything you know he could have said
[54:43] well bless God I'm the prophet no what'd
[54:45] he do yeah if that'd be pleasing to my
[54:47] Lord that's okay yeah if I go with the
[54:49] same spirit I have now he looked at me
[54:51] kind of strange
[54:53] yeah
[54:54] I've seen four or five of them there
[54:56] young men young wives fine women I know
[54:59] how them boys love their wives so I said
[55:01] to them I said here's the way to test
[55:04] if your wife before you were married now
[55:06] you go back save this married life
[55:08] you've been dreaming you were married
[55:09] yeah
[55:13] yeah here's a way to test it I'll start
[55:14] again if you were white before you were
[55:16] married now you go back say this married
[55:18] life you've been dreaming you were
[55:19] married but you really wasn't married
[55:21] but you dreamed you were and you woke up
[55:24] and you went and talked it over with
[55:25] your girlfriend said you know I dreamed
[55:26] that we were married and we had children
[55:28] we living happy and waiting for the
[55:30] coming of the Lord and everything and
[55:32] then this girl would say to you you know
[55:34] I love another man better than I love
[55:35] you
[55:36] I could be happier with the other man
[55:39] could you from your heart love her well
[55:42] enough to say God's blessings rest upon
[55:45] you my dear go with this other man
[55:49] did you yeah
[55:53] now now check that
[55:56] each of you men are you women see well
[55:59] if your love is correct you would do
[56:02] that for you're interested in her
[56:04] welfare right what you know you could
[56:08] have her
[56:09] you can live with her she's your wife
[56:12] she will be she'll marry you but she
[56:14] won't be happy
[56:15] she would be happier and then if you
[56:17] love her then you want her to be happy
[56:20] therefore whatever the will of God is
[56:22] that God's will be done whether I'm
[56:24] happy with it or not I want to live so
[56:26] he will be pleased with what I do
[56:29] therefore check your objective
[56:32] and your motive by that
[56:35] you know whether you love God or not
[56:37] what if he'd say you serve me if I'm
[56:39] going to cast you away I'll let him in a
[56:41] happy man's right your objective
[56:46] and your motive
[56:48] now
[56:49] active
[56:51] and motive
[56:53] think about those two things what is
[56:55] motive that's your motivation behind
[56:58] what you do right all right your
[57:00] objective is something you're going
[57:01] toward
[57:03] right the objective of us
[57:05] going to eat is that it's going to be
[57:07] lunch in a few minutes and the objective
[57:09] of that is we're hungry and want to go
[57:10] eat right but it's something we're
[57:12] heading toward and we know we're going
[57:14] to that all right say we're building a
[57:16] house our objective is it's to build it
[57:18] a certain way but what is our motivation
[57:20] to live in it same way with your love of
[57:23] God and your love for your spouse and
[57:24] your love for your children all that
[57:26] check your objective and your motive is
[57:29] it self-centered yeah
[57:32] come on people is it self-centered right
[57:36] right if the wife is a weaker vessel we
[57:38] should submit all things
[57:40] we're going to read it out in just a
[57:41] little bit don't worry
[57:43] you ain't all just them being submission
[57:45] to us and all that good stuff right all
[57:47] right
[57:48] let's go to Romans 12 and 9.
[57:52] let love be without
[57:55] dissimulation
[57:58] right amen
[58:01] no argument no no no nothing
[58:04] a that which is evil and what do
[58:07] we say about Cleve last Sunday that word
[58:09] cleave means in the original glue yeah
[58:14] in other words glue to that which is
[58:16] good or stick stick to that which is
[58:18] good all right first John 4 18.
[58:23] there is no what
[58:28] what was Adam's first problem yeah
[58:31] yeah he was afraid he was afraid to meet
[58:34] gun because the fellowship had been
[58:36] disconnected but there is no fear in
[58:40] love
[58:41] but perfect love casts this out fear
[58:45] because fear has torment now we can take
[58:47] this in a spiritual aspect but look
[58:49] let's just take this into natural love
[58:51] just regular let's just drop down to
[58:52] fill your love there shouldn't be no
[58:54] fear in love but there is because we
[58:56] don't have agape love all right but
[58:59] perfect love agape love casts out fear
[59:01] because fear hath what
[59:03] that's right torment
[59:07] that's why brother Branham said what he
[59:10] said to that to those people
[59:12] if you love that sister enough
[59:15] to let her be happy somewhere else
[59:19] whether it hurts you inside or not
[59:21] physically you know naturally right
[59:24] I have no fear because you're in the
[59:27] right motive and objective right so
[59:30] you're not tormented by it
[59:32] you won't be tormented by if you allow
[59:34] that to happen because you're giving
[59:35] you're subjecting yourself and saying
[59:37] hey if she can live better with somebody
[59:39] else now we're talking about before
[59:41] we're mad I ain't talking about sitting
[59:42] here talking about you got to do this
[59:43] all right I don't want anybody in the on
[59:46] the internet to misinterpret what I'm
[59:48] saying and I'm not saying to you people
[59:50] are already married brother Brandon was
[59:52] making an illustration of somebody
[59:53] before they were before they got married
[59:55] all right so now
[59:57] fear half torment need it fear it
[1:00:03] read it yeah he that feareth is not made
[1:00:07] perfect in love amen
[1:00:10] because perfect love cast out fear right
[1:00:13] all right now let's go
[1:00:15] to Hebrews chapter 3
[1:00:18] well it's going to be a quote
[1:00:20] number eight
[1:00:24] listen to this we're gonna read this and
[1:00:26] and then this afternoon we're going to
[1:00:28] start on
[1:00:30] a three-dimensional love
[1:00:34] has to be you know
[1:00:36] you're a body experience a soul right
[1:00:38] okay we'll talk about three-dimensional
[1:00:40] love this afternoon but we'll be done
[1:00:42] right here you'd asked him about it well
[1:00:44] we got our television that's how we find
[1:00:46] Comfort see that's the American attitude
[1:00:48] see we got television we got plenty of
[1:00:50] money we got Fine Cars we got nice homes
[1:00:54] what do we need with the Lord we don't
[1:00:56] need that and that's the attitude
[1:00:58] about the only religion and salvation we
[1:01:01] have and love is among the real godly
[1:01:04] people right you know the Bible said
[1:01:07] that will happen congregation says amen
[1:01:09] uh-huh you Bible readers I heard you
[1:01:12] holler a man and you preachers back
[1:01:13] there that's right the love would be so
[1:01:16] far away
[1:01:18] right in the last days the only love
[1:01:20] there would be left
[1:01:22] would be between the elect of God's
[1:01:24] people father would be against mother
[1:01:26] mother against father and children
[1:01:28] against parents how many of you seen
[1:01:29] that children killing their parents and
[1:01:31] parents killing their children
[1:01:33] physically
[1:01:34] have you seen that why
[1:01:36] fear anxiety emotion stress just keep
[1:01:41] that one they have no objective or
[1:01:44] motive right you say yeah they do no
[1:01:46] they don't
[1:01:47] if I had an objective and a motive
[1:01:49] they'd be focused on what they're doing
[1:01:52] because what did Satan do he took he
[1:01:54] took that and perverted it the love
[1:01:56] would be so far away in the last days
[1:01:58] the only love there would be left will
[1:01:59] be between the lack of God's people
[1:02:01] follow me against mother mother against
[1:02:03] father and children against parents and
[1:02:05] different ones against each other and
[1:02:07] the only love would be left would be
[1:02:09] just that elect just the elected the
[1:02:11] word elect there comes from the word
[1:02:13] elected God's elected
[1:02:19] now let's read one more scripture to
[1:02:21] make it go for this afternoon Matthew
[1:02:23] 22.
[1:02:25] this is something to think about for
[1:02:26] this afternoon
[1:02:29] because out in the world
[1:02:32] you have a one or two dimensional love
[1:02:36] body and spirit yeah
[1:02:39] but the reason that we have a complete
[1:02:42] love is because we have Body Spirit and
[1:02:44] soul
[1:02:45] going in the right direction amen Jesus
[1:02:47] said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord
[1:02:49] God with all thy heart
[1:02:51] all thy soul and all thy mind amen this
[1:02:56] is the first and great
[1:02:58] commandment amen husbands love your wife
[1:03:01] with all your heart with all your souls
[1:03:05] and with all your mind
[1:03:08] love your husbands with all your heart
[1:03:10] with all your soul with all your mind
[1:03:12] man
[1:03:14] because if you love the Lord
[1:03:17] we'll read a quote this afternoon then
[1:03:18] men
[1:03:20] now what's going to happen
[1:03:22] we're going to read some things this
[1:03:24] afternoon
[1:03:25] and brother Brown is going to kind of
[1:03:26] pick through this and pick some quotes
[1:03:28] out that he made but it comes down to
[1:03:30] where Abraham and Sarah where Sarah
[1:03:32] called him more
[1:03:34] he said if you don't act like a Lord she
[1:03:36] ain't gonna call you that
[1:03:38] yeah
[1:03:39] but being a true godly man you receive
[1:03:42] that just like you say this right here
[1:03:43] Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[1:03:46] with all your heart soul and mind
[1:03:49] now we're going to be that way down here
[1:03:52] love our spouses because if I if the
[1:03:54] order is different down here
[1:03:58] you can't connect up there right
[1:04:01] I mean this is just like brother
[1:04:02] remember this is just primer thing this
[1:04:04] is just the primary stuff right but
[1:04:06] still if we don't get this done if we
[1:04:08] don't get this settled then what's going
[1:04:10] to happen right Satan is going to do it
[1:04:13] I promise you he is going to come in and
[1:04:16] he is going to put a knife somewhere in
[1:04:18] between
[1:04:21] and it's going to be a wedge right or
[1:04:24] what a division
[1:04:25] and you don't want division we're trying
[1:04:28] to put this thing back together man
[1:04:30] Satan is the one that divided all of us
[1:04:31] up right from fellowship remember I was
[1:04:34] afraid there's no fearing God we read
[1:04:36] that there's no fear in God yeah so
[1:04:37] where'd that fear come from it was a
[1:04:39] little part of Adam that was a human
[1:04:42] that Satan could get to a Son of God yes
[1:04:45] son of God let me get to you
[1:04:48] be done and pray for me I'm the only man
[1:04:49] in the world that he does then
[1:04:52] I think we all can't keep him busy
[1:04:57] but we got what the division the
[1:04:59] headship is there but all this is coming
[1:05:02] back to where it all is going to mount
[1:05:04] back together again all right all right
[1:05:06] so that's what God's wanting us to do
[1:05:08] and I think what he's done was give us
[1:05:10] so much stuff
[1:05:11] to do and things to do with the world
[1:05:15] because the world don't have love as we
[1:05:17] should have love
[1:05:19] and I'll read you some more things in
[1:05:21] here and let's stand
[1:05:28] so we will start this afternoon right
[1:05:31] there with a three-dimensional love
[1:05:34] because true love requires three parts
[1:05:36] amen you love with your body and your
[1:05:39] spirit
[1:05:41] all the other three all the other the
[1:05:43] Eros and the and the filial love and the
[1:05:46] storage you can do that with your body
[1:05:47] and your spirit right
[1:05:49] because the person a good person can do
[1:05:51] that out in the world
[1:05:52] but to be truly
[1:05:55] one with God
[1:05:57] that Third Realm or that little realm
[1:05:59] inside of you is called the soul that's
[1:06:02] your motivator
[1:06:04] and motivating its way out and we'll
[1:06:06] we'll
[1:06:07] we'll use some quotes and some scripture
[1:06:10] and brother Joe was released this
[1:06:13] morning at 10 40 from the hospital so
[1:06:15] praise God for that
[1:06:18] man I remember when you had your
[1:06:21] appendix taken out my Heavens used out
[1:06:24] for two three weeks and you know sore
[1:06:27] and it cuts you from here to here you
[1:06:29] know and gallbladder surgery too and
[1:06:31] then and now all they do is just make a
[1:06:33] few holes and go in there and just
[1:06:35] cut it out a little at a time and take
[1:06:37] that thing out without any incision
[1:06:40] but you know
[1:06:42] God had to heal that part all right man
[1:06:45] couldn't do that
[1:06:46] they just took out what was bad and then
[1:06:50] God healed the rest of them you know
[1:06:52] that so we give God all the honor and
[1:06:54] Glory you love him amen love him then
[1:06:56] you're heading all the way loving each
[1:06:58] other right amen amen all right marriage
[1:07:02] part three from this afternoon will be
[1:07:04] marriage part four
[1:07:06] we're going to talk about motive and
[1:07:08] objective again three-dimensional love
[1:07:11] and that true love requires all three
[1:07:13] parts amen okay I know and I know it's
[1:07:16] hard no one say this to right now before
[1:07:18] I forget it it's real hard for you that
[1:07:21] don't have your spouse here
[1:07:23] but we're praying for that right right
[1:07:25] okay
[1:07:27] but you truly can't be one without the
[1:07:30] baptism of the Holy Night amen okay you
[1:07:32] really can't you can't be truly
[1:07:34] one without the Holy Ghost all right
[1:07:37] either you both don't have it or one
[1:07:40] diet one don't but see you're working
[1:07:42] towards something and I'm not all right
[1:07:44] they maybe say some things in here that
[1:07:45] it may be hard to understand maybe for
[1:07:47] some of the young people but
[1:07:50] you look that we do live in the in the
[1:07:53] dimensions of of Body Spirit and soul
[1:07:55] that motivates us and before we go we're
[1:07:58] motivated by CK still smelling here
[1:08:00] right memory reason conscious affection
[1:08:04] and Imagination right consciousness
[1:08:07] Perfection love
[1:08:09] female love R.E Ross our storage that
[1:08:13] happens in that second realm right but
[1:08:15] when you take that though and you put it
[1:08:17] in it all in that to take that third Rim
[1:08:18] which is Faith about our love or hatred
[1:08:21] right
[1:08:23] all right
[1:08:24] there's only two right say faith or that
[1:08:27] one I just read you faith is love right
[1:08:30] and hatred is of the devil right all
[1:08:33] right let's say something do you ever
[1:08:35] need 93 inch Power 93 inch power bill
[1:08:38] this thing we got a little time we've
[1:08:39] seen them say a couple of songs I know
[1:08:42] this is not some kind of outstanding
[1:08:44] emotional thing but
[1:08:46] maybe it will be when you get home
[1:09:12] I don't know
[1:09:44] foreign
[1:11:05] much
[1:11:53] the man
[1:11:56] the man become crazy
[1:12:00] he got rid of all
[1:12:02] jobs
[1:12:04] drop down and
[1:12:08] if there's a whole ocean right
[1:12:11] which is
[1:12:12] more water
[1:12:14] was full of me
[1:12:17] and every tree you see with a quilt a
[1:12:20] right whip
[1:12:23] for a man ascribed by trade in the skies
[1:12:26] were just a parchment a roll of paper
[1:12:30] it drained the ocean right
[1:12:32] nor could this floor contain the hole in
[1:12:35] those fish from Scottish kind you know
[1:12:37] that man probably couldn't attain to
[1:12:39] this but you and I can Glory right you
[1:12:42] and I can attain to this
[1:12:45] because we got the person that is Love
[1:12:48] Inside Amen Brother Richard he was
[1:12:51] looking for that person and couldn't
[1:12:53] find him because of certain things in
[1:12:54] the world but if you look for him and
[1:12:56] you find him then you found a love of
[1:13:00] God right how rich and pure how
[1:13:03] measureless and strong
[1:13:04] you know to a human being that is
[1:13:06] majorless
[1:13:08] but when you and I get in that City
[1:13:11] that's gonna be amen love Glory that's
