========================================

on the internet and it was about psalms 23 and it says i have to admit i always wondered what this part of psalms 23 meant i thought he anoints my head with oil was figurative language for god keeping the psalmist healthy i never knew this parallel anoint my head with oil she can get their head caught in the briars and die trying to get untangled there are hybrid little flies that like to torment sheep by laying eggs in their nostrils which turn into worms and drive the sheep to beat their head against a rock sometimes to death their ears in their eyes are also susceptible to tormenting insects so the shepherd shepherd anoints their whole head with oil then there is peace that oil forms a barrier of protection against the evil that tries to destroy the sheep do you have times of mental torment do the worrisome thoughts invade your mind over and over do you beat your head against a wall trying to stop them have you ever asked god to anoint your head with oil he has an endless supply his oil protects and makes it possible for you to fix your heart mind and eyes on him today and always there is peace in the valley may our good good father anoint your head with oil today so that your cup overflows with blessings god is good and he is faithful the reason i wanted to read that after i read that this morning this itching from the shingles has been torment and i sit up here in church and i'm scratching and it's driving me crazy so after i read that i prayed and asked god to anoint my head with oil and to stop that itching stop that torment that this itching is driving me crazy i want to beat my head against the wall i have not itched since then well i did a moment when bob was up here doing sunday school i prayed the same prayer again and since that bob was up here i have not itched again so it worked yes probably going to sing open the eyes of my heart brother luis is ready to go so first thing let's sing open the eyes of my heart and my brother elise come open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart [Music] open the eyes [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] pour out your power and love all [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the lord jesus it's good to be behind this desk once again i've been here about eight weeks maybe yeah it's good to be back and uh appreciate sister susan that testimony god is a healing god he heals it in the simplest ways so we just thank god for that um we just um we just think it's counted a privilege to be uh to be part of this uh congregation amen i know we don't join anything we don't we're not we're not members here or anything like that but we're members of the bride of jesus christ here in lula georgia amen amen so so it just counted the privilege and um no i just really didn't have my tie to put it in so i got the sweater on so i didn't i was like okay i could just put it here but if my beard starts scratching it i'll just pick up one of the lord bless you all um we want to we want to go ahead and uh let us let's just turn to revelations chapter 10 revelations chapter 10 and and we want to read from verses uh let's just read from verse 8 down to verse 11. this is one of my favorite scriptures in the in the in the bible just one of them but this was this is the scripture that that was my theme for the uh for the for the our trip that we just took and this is what i was trying to get people to see well i was just preaching but i was hoping that the lord would just do the work let the lord do the talking um the whole point the whole point of of of what i was trying to minister to the people as we were going by different places is to let them know that that they are now the sons of god amen and to take what is already been opened for them you know to take their positions in christ not something that's coming or something that was but something that is and that if you just get into the is you'll you won't miss the what's coming and i was trying to get people to see during the trip you know uh you know it's the the gift of god is is for you it's got your name wrapped it's got your name on it it's wrapped in even a little bulge all you got to do is just take it and that's the part that i believe that we even here in the states that we have a hard time grasping that the promises of god are yea and amen and the varying man that means so be it they're yours they're yours now and not tomorrow but they're yours now and so i i believe god uh in many different instances during our trip um i believe the if i was talking to this with brother wade that uh if you could just at least get the ministers or pastors to see that then they can continue preaching that to the people because uh um it's very important um if you can just get them to see that so let's just read this real quick and then i'll have you be seated in revelations chapter 10 verse 8 says and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open which is open that's the key we know that in revelation chapter 5 it was closed but who opened it jesus christ the lamb amen now that lamb is a lion amen and and and then he came here at the beginning of this chapter with an open book in verse 1. but it says here go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i being john here and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and see that's what we do amen but he said unto me take it take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and then verse 11 which was kind of interesting that verse 11 it's the number 11 and and what hour are we living in in this hour we are we are 11th hour people and this is verse 11. so this got to be us talking about us and he said unto me thou must thou must prophesy which the word prophesy there is like preach right now i must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings amen so that to me right there just tells me that missionary work is to continue to continue going on it doesn't stop right amen and even if it's just mission work amen if you even if you're just preaching to your neighbor you're still doing mission work amen so let's just go to the lord in prayer heavenly father we thank you once again for the opportunity to serve you in this hour thank you lord for the reading of your word blessed father god may you continue to be with the needs that are there amongst us father lord many many needs father but lord you know all about them and you knew them before the foundation of the world we thank you father we commit the service into your hands now and we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen lord bless you amen so i appreciate each and every one of you all for praying for us on this trip we left november the 30th goodness it seems like it was yesterday when we left took a took a vehicle and got to the airport everything went smooth no problems thank god and we were out for a total about seven weeks [Music] ministered ministered about 41 times in seven weeks so the equivalent of we did the calculation i forgot how much pretty much i preached what i would preach in about two to three months here i preached it in seven in seven weeks would have been about 43 44 service or times but there was a few times where i had gotten sick and i couldn't preach and and there were some other different arrangements that had to take place but god was still with us amen now all the out of all of those 41 times all of them were not services at church there were some times where i had preached on the radio uh they took me to a a tv station to preach as well so i was live on tv in honduras uh they have some brothers there have a tv program and uh they uh so i was on i preached there for an hour and uh but i mean it's just like preaching i mean you get into it i mean you're just preaching and then two of those times as well i was i was interpreting for a a brother here from the united states brother david nash who was there helping preaching the youth camp that we were ministering at there in honduras so um so lord helped us and uh protected us nothing nothing really uh um you know hurt us as far as uh you know any major things you know to take place you know we got we got sick a few times fever uh my wife about her cut her finger off but uh but uh god uh healed that finger already so and [Applause] and a few little things here and there but the lord was with us overall and i could see i could see you know and i'm going to come to the to the pictures and videos but i could really see the hand of the lord throughout this trip my whole purpose for this trip was throughout the years there have been several invitations for me to go and also to help uh hold uh youth camps in in uh in different places of course when 2020 came in and uh we never got to go and so a lot of those uh invitations were being stacked and so there was different plans that i had made with with several of the brethren down there and so we wanted to fulfill those plans we wanted to to do that and and one of the main things that i wanted to do was uh visit uh some of these little places that uh churches that don't hardly ever get visited as a matter of fact in one of them and one of the places that we visited in honduras they have never had a minister or a preacher from outside of honduras visit them at all hardly anybody even even in honduras knew that that church existed and so i per supposedly i was the first person from the united states to go visit that church and so they were they were very very they were so thankful you know to to to that you know for you to have taken your time to go visit visit them the pastor he's been pastoring there since 1974 or 76 something like that just almost just as long as brother dale has been pastoring and he's uh he's 60 something years old and uh he's uh i'll show you the pictures later but he he's the song leader there he takes up the offering he preaches uh he's the deacon he's everything he has hardly no help whatsoever the majority of the of the people that go to his church are are sisters and he only has like two or three men there that so he does just about everything and he's been like that since 1970 something so and so uh you know just for you to just stop by to just to see him so uh the brother the local the brother that took me up that way um they're start they're starting to try to get more fellowship with him now and with that church so that there can be a you know a better connection and get you know more ministers coming in there to help them out but if we had not gone there to visit them that wouldn't have been that wouldn't have been done and so we just thank god for that but i wanna i wanna see if if wanna start off maybe if bella could come and uh she wants she gonna testify zoe do you wanna come with bella you can stand here no okay all right so they just come bella and she has a few words um so first off i'd really like to thank poppy and nanny for letting us go brother wade thank you for letting us go it was truly an amazing experience um our uh our main objective of this trip was to of course win souls to the kingdom of god teach people about the lord but one thing that i definitely kept in mind the entire trip was once i got there i was no longer american i became part of these people i wanted to i didn't want to be treated as if i were this sort of royalty i wanted to be treated as if i had lived there my entire life and i think that having that kind of mentality really helps shape what happens during this trip and so during this entire trip i really wanted to bond with the people to understand them to learn how they lived and it is very obvious that the way they live is completely different to how we live and you'll soon notice that in the pictures um but even though they don't have all of the commodities that we have here at home and everything that helps us be comfortable they are still genuinely happy and they don't there are homes that i've been to that don't even have electricity and yet there they are still smiling and thanking god for everything they have and i thought that was quite amazing um i was able to meet multiple people multiple youth i made many friends that i love and cherish and they send greetings to all of you um they were so excited to know that i spoke spanish because they thought that would be a problem and for a while they they didn't talk to me but once that wall was taken down i was able to create relations with them their families and get to know them and they are such wonderful people and i think that if you were to meet them you would just get along with them so well and i just felt at home i did get an a small injury i got a burn um while helping repair a sister's stove and it took a while to heal up but thankfully i just have a scar there it's completely gone um i think that i've been able to really open up my perspective throughout this trip and i'm really glad i was able to go the lord really worked through this trip and i think that it was definitely something that really will never that i i'll never be able to forget um just before i finish there are a few things that i think i definitely missed um due to the difference in um how how different their lives were one i think one thing that i definitely missed was high-speed wi-fi we rarely ever had high-speed wi-fi so we were all kind of connected to this one hot spot that ended up cutting off for a good four weeks and we were surviving on very slow internet so that was great that made school much easier um i think another thing that i also missed was um flushing toilets and i know that seems very outlandish but it was something that i did miss dragging water up and down all the time was just very uncomfortable but i gained some strength that i did not have when i left i just air conditioning in general just the things that i have here at home that i never noticed before um but most of all i think we missed you all you guys are all our family we see all of you as our aunts uncles cousins brothers and sisters most of all and i think that we're so glad to be back home even though it was such an amazing trip and it was such a great experience there's really no place like home god bless you thank you bella appreciate that yes i could say that i miss one of the things i miss is flushing toilets as well i tell you what saints uh you know it's it and i know some of you older saints you all had the how out houses here at one point and everything like that but people over there still live that way i mean you have to go to an outhouse to go to the toilet and i mean you just see that hole in the ground and that's it you got that steam coming up and and it's not it's not fun [Laughter] but uh but if you did see you know in some places and i'll show here in just a moment you if they if you if you could just at least go in the now house and there's a little commode there even if it doesn't flush i mean the kimono might be wet and stuff and things like that man that was wonderful because you could at least you know you could at least you know take a bucket and flush that way you know but i mean you can't do anything with a hole in the ground [Laughter] in several places it had to be that way there was no other option but um so it's just the things that we take for granted you know things that we take for granted and uh and to them it's just a normal thing you know it's just everyday life you know this is how we live this is how it is so it's awesome to see like she said to see both sides of the world because both sides of the spectrum because it helps you to be i guess be more thankful you know helps you be more thankful so if the brother can bring up the first uh picture and i'm just going to give you all a warning i'm i'm really i don't want to keep you all here too long this afternoon that's i don't want that but i'm not going to get done with this this is only just even a portion of where we went so maybe there'll be another part two at another time um of the rest of the trip but um we could just go ahead and start and what i did is i tried to take what i tr i tried to take the pictures in in in sequence you know an order of events of what was taking place as well as when while i was away up in the mountains and what also what is go what was happening what what was bella zoe and christine doing while i was away because they were they were doing ministerial type of things as well uh while i was up there in the mountains you know preaching and things like that so if the brothers could bring that up i don't we have a problem all right we appreciate brother anderson and richard yes there you go all right look look how nice and bright it is as a matter of fact can i turn off the light brother by the way it just looks much better with it is it don't fall asleep i hope not i got that's it all right all right so this is the day when we were flying out and so i don't know who these people are but but go ahead next um this is a a view of of of the from the plane when we were heading out next all right man thank you brother wade i i was over there and i i was going to do that but i thought i thought well no no that's okay that's fine uh bella and zoe on our way over there next all right all right next this is an island there all right so when we got there to honduras we we left uh november 30th we left at uh around uh i forgot what time we left it was real early in the morning and we got there around noon and uh so we were very hungry and so that is uh brothers took us to eat some fish and plantains and it was quickly devoured uh you know this restaurant where they took us you know you you would see the rats you know while crawling up in the up in the rafters and stuff and the roaches but that didn't matter that doesn't matter when you're hungry yeah it doesn't matter where you're hungry i don't know where they even had that fish but when you're hungry you're hungry next we just prayed over it listen that's why we pray for our food right all right let's pray for our food now this is uh this right here on the on all the way up to the right that's brother eric brother eric gaggio this is his wife sister rebecca this is their son this is a brother from their church brother eric is the brother that we help support here and that we've sent do you remember when we sent money for the truck the tires that's that that's brother eric he's the one that picked us up from the airport and um pretty much um he took us many of the different places where we went and uh but he is a pastor there um in in talanga uh honduras and now he's taking over a a another church there where the pastor had had left and uh so now he's uh i could tell you know you pray for him because the the the work there has become very stressful you know for him you know and uh but he's his heart for the people is is so great i mean the way he deals with the people um you can tell that he's he's you know he's stressed but yeah he doesn't show it i mean he just tells me you know hey listen i'm dealing with this you know you just pray for me but but he still you know just just doesn't show it and just tries and i guess that's part of being a pastor i mean brother dale would know and uh you know dealing with people isn't easy they all come with different walks of life and they have the same battles there that we do here so next there we are uh this at the place where we were eating at the restaurant this is one of the lakes there's a big lake over there and uh as i forget the name of the lake uh i can't remember the name of the lake right now next all right that's that's the lake over there um and just right below here are there are the rats next and the cockroaches too bell and zoey with the fish next all right so the um the when we got there november 30th on december the 1st uh is when we started uh the the the youth camp that we were going to have brother eric was holding a youth camp and uh it was going to be a four or five day youth camp and uh it's this is this is his church this is his church there the first service we started it was on a wednesday night we started the service there brother david nash preached and uh and actually we started back uh the the uh on on wednesday we started at the youth at the youth ground but this was thursday um and um and so we started at his church and uh i think this is i don't know if this is a video oh no this is a picture next several uh uh several people from around the the country came to in support of that youth camp [Applause] brother david nash i believe he's from washington state and he's uh he's a he's a pastor over there [Music] [Music] okay so this right here is where we actually held the youth the youth camp the youth event and what happened is brother eric this is a school that he works at uh he pastors but he also works he's a teacher at us at a school and they let him uh have that place the the this is their courtyard the school's court courtyard and they let them have that place for a very very cheap amount i mean extremely extremely affordable and so this was the first uh service or second service there at that at that campground or that that area next all right here's some of the sisters they were working feeding uh i would say probably i would say i would say maybe about 200 200 youth came out from different places and the sisters were very hard at work and constantly fixing meals for them because it was it was uh three services a day and so pretty much they would eat almost just about after every service so next there's zoe and and me next and there's christine she's helping the them cook this is where she had cut her finger so i thought about i don't know what you were that you were trying to cut sweetheart and she cut part of her her finger and uh she did a pretty good good cut on there and she said that thing it just just just like fleshed i mean just cut right through the flesh and but she's much better now thank god next all right next all right this right here is sister edie's little sister edis has a a a tremendous testimony she's um she she was really she was really wanting to have um she has she she has a daughter who's 10 years she's 10 years old but she really wants a boy so she had asked us ministers you know to pray for her and she's believing that god's going to you know give her a boy and that because they told her that i believe they've told her that she's had or her her husband has problems you know for them to be able to conceive again so but she has a background where her mom left her when she was 15 years old and she became pretty much a street girl and she's had uh in her testimony she tells about having a man she's chasing her down the street wanting to rape her and if there wasn't for some police that she saw there there would have been no telling what would have happened to her she used to work in a landfill and she has seen in the landfill where they've come upon bags and there'd be dead babies in the bags one of the worst ones they found was a big bag and it was about a eight-year-old a nine-year-old girl that was in the bag and so people just they commit do atrocious things and they just throw them out in the landfill you know and they come so she was telling me about that her testimony and and through that through those things that she was seeing as she was growing up um she wasn't serving the lord at that time but it made her think she said when i have a when i have a child i'm not to do that i'm going to keep the child i'm going to keep the child because she she her first child was with a person that wasn't he he impregnated her and left her i think he lives here in the states now somewhere but never never has seen the girl as far as i know and um and she said she said she had a choice to keep the child or not and she decided to keep the little girl and the little girl's 10 years old now we gave her some a little offering money because she said she wanted to buy her little girl a new dress and so some of that money that that you all provided which we thank you all for uh helped her buy her a little dress i think some shoes and things like that and uh we gave her actually a little bit more and she was really thankful for that so y'all pray for sister eddie's next all right this is uh that's brother eric on the on the right me brother ely uh and brother allen brother alan he's from nicaragua uh and the other two brothers they're in honduras we're out they're all ministers uh pastor brother eric and these these brothers do mission work so they're very in tune with the areas that we went to um just young brothers you know and that's that's what they do you know just evangelism and mission work next all right and so here's again um one of the days there at the youth camp and i was there interpreting for brother david nash next this is me uh now preaching on the first time i was preaching here at the youth brother dale everywhere we went your greetings went to everybody [Music] we always made sure that brother dale brother samuel dale sends his greetings and the church in lula georgia since their greetings and they always send their greetings back so so what you do is we tell them how many sentences are greetings back and they're like amen so all those amens come back to you all as a matter of fact i was in there and one of the brothers was telling me please tell please tell the church we say hello and lord bless you all so next this is one of the evenings [Music] is playing the violin [Music] very talented musicians and the majority of them are young people [Music] something's happening i don't remember what this one was [Music] next all right so this is uh one of the altar calls and uh so we would just go up front several young people that would go up after services and they wanted to accept the lord uh wanted the holy ghost and so we would just pray with them you know and uh and uh and my whole point with them is because i wanted them when i would pray for them and i would explain to them listen don't don't come up and then come back again tomorrow night and and you know take what's yours now god wants to give it to you so just just just receive it it's yours and that was that was my whole point that i was trying to get across to them um that that because they feel like they they have to do that it's like they feel like they have to put some part of it in themselves in order to appease god it's almost like a catholic mentality and uh but when you give them the word and tell them that god is a god of now you know that god wants to give it to you more than even what you're asking for you know he it's already there for you he's already done it then it gives them a a sense of of liberty you know and so next there's some of the young people worshiping next [Music] this is some of the young brothers after one of the services [Music] and they were always playing the guitar singing just very happy all right next all right and um here's some of the sisters now this is sister hannah is that hannah and she's brother david nash's uh uh niece and she was there she's from washington state and uh she studied spanish so she spoke very good spanish and on one of the nights uh i think it was the last night of the of the of that youth event they had me go up with her because she wanted to give a testimony and how and she wanted to thank everybody about the wonderful time the you know everything that had taken place and so i stood there next to her and she was reading her her what she was she was going to say but she was reading it in spanish and i didn't have to interpret not one thing for her she said it so good and and it's just and and then she said thank you all very much god bless you all and i just stood there with the microphone in my hand and then i just looked at the congregation and i just said [Laughter] and uh so she did a really good job next all right this right here is bella and zoe uh singing the special um [Music] this is the song what song is this this is the goodness of god but she's singing it in spanish [Music] is [Music] okay next all right here's some of the sisters they got their hair nets on christine it looks good on her doesn't it [Laughter] they're just busy they were they were constantly the sisters didn't really even get to to go to the to the the services because uh they're just constantly there cooking for the young people next after the after the event they were go ahead bro after the event they were uh properly acknowledged you know because they it couldn't be done without them either this is christine she would gather a lot of the young people and they would sing specials together and so they're here they're singing to god be the glory [Music] [Music] next y'all know that christine could sing in spanish she surprises me too there's some of the brothers uh they're just working hard they're at the event next all right and here's some of the places where they slept they didn't have nice bunk beds they just had little mattresses one one thing that that was requested is that they want to be able to use the same uh what they do is throughout all the uh youth events that they have in honduras they use those same little mattresses everywhere everywhere they go and so this this this cover for the mattresses is coming off and a lot of them and so uh they were requesting a donation you know if we wanted to help get the the covers back on them because they want to keep using the same mattresses and so since the mattresses are still in good condition they can just still use them but just have new covers on over them so that was a request and and so a lot of the churches there are helping pitch in to get this going for these events next all right this is me um sunday uh sunday morning which was the last service of the meeting uh the last service of the meeting [Music] we were i was trying to explain to them how god comes to our left he comes down to our level and how we don't have to be afraid you know and i was given an example of of a of a young brother a brother there who's while i was in the truck you can pause it for a moment i was there in the truck studying and just kind of looking over what i was going to preach i was preaching about now we are the sons of god and and i looked over to my right and i saw this this brother whose son he did something he hurt himself and he went he was crying and he went running to his dad and his dad what his dad did is uh he didn't ask him what's going on what happened what's wrong what he did is he got down to to his son and just kind of hugged him didn't ask him he just his first instinct was to just comfort him and as i was there in the truck i was thinking my goodness that's what god does to us you know he doesn't scold us he doesn't you know when you come to god and you've been you lost in your ways you know what he does is he come he came down to our level even when he came here on earth he came down to your level and that's what the bible says see to experience what it was so that he can be the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities and so he experienced everything that you and i experience and he understands and so that's what i was trying to explain get get across to them and uh to see the young people these young people when you preach to them the simplicity of the gospel the simplicity of what is the new birth the simplicity of being birth uh born again uh because the the way it's preached to them it's it it's because it just gets very difficult they they they it becomes almost like do's and don'ts and and that's all they hear and they get slammed on top of the head uh conked on top of the head a lot you know by the way they live and by the way they act and when and then when you bring it out and it it from the scripture of what it is to be born again and what it is to receive the holy spirit and it all goes back to the word a lot of them was like wow i've never heard that before so they were really really really touched by that and uh i believe they that some of them i think god revealed the word to them and by some by some of the things that was expressed to me next [Music] about how the bride is to do the is the voice uh in this last stage and and and how she's to do the works there was a work left for us to do in this hour next all right so um this right here is where the uh the youth camp was held at um around around around this area and so that's why i wanted to put the the map up uh as we're going through the images and videos and then i'll i'll i'll interlace this map through there so that you can see where we were at and where where the events took place next right now we are in on the road to catacamas or area in an area called holancha this is our our precious brother he's a missionary and uh evangelist here in the in the country a wonderful brother there's christine that's his wife brother lee's wife sister lily she's been holding her little baby there there's valenzuela's asleep [Music] i wanted to put these in here so that you all understand this is how we pretty much would ride everywhere we would go just crammed in there they they would they would uh try to take the most of every space available and try to take as many people with them as possible wherever so this is where we were riding we were riding to catacamas um um which was on the on the eastern part of honduras there on the map and uh next all right and this it was about a it was about a two-hour drive from from the from talanga where where the youth meeting was held and then now we arrived that evening and we were hungry so we were looking for somewhere to eat and as we were there like the lights just go out the the lights in the city just go off randomly and so it just it was it was you see how nice and bright it is there right now but then all of a sudden power was out and people were like oh the power went out again [Laughter] but they know that in about 20 30 minutes it'll come back and so power came back and then you start hearing the generators running everywhere next i'm not sure what this what happened here what this is next all right so the next day is when we were uh this this is where christine and the girls stayed this is the brethren that we were we made plans to go up to the mountains up in an area called los angeles really is what it's called i would tell the brethren and joke with them that you know we have los angeles too and they know that i said but now this is a holy los angeles this is much the one we have over there is completely uh it's gone and uh but and they would just laugh about that and of course you know that's where we get hollywood and stuff but see these are some of the brethren that went up next all right this is about now to los angeles la florida brothers are packing up this is about five in the morning and uh about five and we're gonna head on out next all right so we went up and met some of some some more people there from brother uh from the church one of the churches there some of the sisters uh that they were going up as well and from this point right here where we were at to where we were going to our destination up in the mountains it was about a four hour hike this is as far as the cars can come the rest of it was going to be a trek on foot next this is one of some of just some of the places uh heading up there next kind of looks like some of the areas up here in the mountains supposedly this is the horse i'm gonna be riding [Laughter] i almost felt like we were one of those caravans coming into the united states you know from honduras they had the baby on and this is kind of 30 minutes into uh already uh us walking next just 35 we just met up with brother nathan so we met up with the pastor that we were going to go up he came down as we were coming up and we met a certain way and he was he brought down the horses horses and and uh and so what they're doing and so uh what they're doing is they're taking our bags and they're putting them in big sacks and they're tying these sacks on the side on the sides of the horses so they'd be easier for us to get up there you can see that's what they're doing there this is brother natividad he's the pastor up there and he's just he's just a rancher he's just a farmer wonderful brother next did you just kind of get this is me on the horse and this is just kind of get a feel of of what it was like going up it was really rocky and honestly i did not even know how even the horse got up got up there carrying 174 pounds on top of his back which was me and where's the poor horse would get tired as well here with the brother there were the times where you'd be riding and and then also he just stops and i'm like and then and then i'd hit it i'd hit it and then he'd go a little bit more and then and then he'd stop again and then he's there and then you'd hit it again and then he just he'd just go you know he'd get upset because you were telling them to move next but we were on i was on horseback for about 45 minutes or so because afterwards my leg was killing me just kind of get a view where we were heading and i'm gonna tell you my legs are killing me right now later on a brother told me that uh that mules do a better job doing this uh so some of the brethren they had they have mules as well but this is what they had provided at the time these horses the horse sound that he normally made but these horses they're very familiar with this way they've already gone up and down two minutes so many times so next all right this is uh now we got there's a little bit easier part just wanted to show y'all some of the views oh it's just beautiful and this is where some of these people live and i would tell them when i would preach to them there'd be people down here you know they would just love to just be able to live there or to at least see this and to them it's just you know it's just normal you know it's just normal life it's hey i i was trying to tell them don't take it for granted there's people down there that would love to be see this uh you can you can turn it up a little bit here i tell you what but if i wanted to lose weight i probably already lost it now [Laughter] this was gonna be this is rougher than what i thought it'd be and i am so glad that christine's bell and zoey did not come on this trip this is a bit tough but it's so beautiful all right all right so this is where we got to our the brother's house for the natividad's uh place and they had uh and they just gave us one just look at they had coffee ready for us oh yeah that's they drink coffee they'd rather drink coffee than water almost you know when you get to those places and they so we were drinking coffee and just kind of show you my boots and you you have to go to those places and this is how you have to walk because this is the reason why how deep this money is if you're not wearing rubber boots you just you can't make it it's hard some of these places you just show you how how deep some of the mud is um freaking through we're gonna we're on our way to have a little service and some of these brethren do this all the time just to go to church up in the uh at home just just to go to church they do this every sunday every time they have service well we have to cross through and uh lord bless them for it this right here is their current all right so this is uh this is brother natividad's place and uh i i gotta i gotta this is his his current church right here on the left but they're building a new church because this this place uh is it's getting very old they're having to replace a lot of the uh the boards on the church for the space this is this is their new little building that they're that they're building uh and just to let you all know some of your funds went to to go support that um lord willing they might have that building done by march and they're gonna have their uh service to dedicate the the church uh and they're gonna use their old building a place to uh to have when they have big meetings you know and they have place to to for people to rest to sleep and things like that but um this is uh this is their current church right now some of some of you all uh helped uh with the efforts for this church and the brother natividad was very thankful for that all right next all right this is brother that's the pastor and uh he's carrying a master here i'm not sure what the sack what was inside the sack but uh they what they do as far as electricity up there uh they use solar panels because they don't have electricity running through there that goes up there so what they do is harness electricity through solar panels and um and so um in the solar panels that the the electricity that is gathered it goes to a battery and so the battery it turns on you know their lights at night and things like that they have one for the church and they have one for their homes now the brother he had the brother natividad the battery for the church it went out so they needed a new a new battery so we're in the process right now with some of the funds that you all gave to buy them a new battery right now we're going to be sending them that money here shortly because we gave them part of part of the money while we were over there but then we're going to we're sending the rest of it here back next week actually so so just to get a feel of what pretty much what we would eat this is just chickens from their yard they would always one time you know they they killed eight chickens in their yard just to give us chicken chicken soup and uh looks uh it was really good next all right so after all that long walk four hour four hours walking this is me laying on a hammock and the sister right here she's uh she's actually uh washing coffee beans like they what they do is they grow coffee in the area and they they produce their own coffee they they grow it they they toast it everything the whole process they do it right there and they go back down to the city four or five hours and they sell it and that's how they make some money and then they come back up four or five hours i also wanted to note that the brothers new church all those bricks that you saw there they had they had to be brought from from all that all that way multiple trips that they took so they can build the church so more power to them because i mean that's just become normal to them to just go up and down that that stretch of of through that way next so yeah it's it's nice uh if you if you've never laid on a hammock before oh my it's it's yeah i don't recommend it to sleep all night in a hammock but it's it's a nice just lay there after a long hike this is some of the areas up there next all right here's some horses and just get a little panoramic view of where we were at this is after we left brother natividad's house we were going up to the place where we were actually another brother's house where we were gonna that's where we were gonna be sleeping at and we were going to have service this evening further down so after that long walk they expected me i was going to preach that night they expected me to preach and we did thank god next just almost all right this is the little house where we stayed at this house um and this this is the brother this is his home he's the assistant he has uh three daughters and the son of the house where we were just and this brother he was just going i mean he would stop he wouldn't stop and uh and wonderful brother it's like he i never saw him tired my goodness never saw him tired look his brother eliakin is his name right here all right back in the place where we left the girls and and christine they were doing homeschool this is zoe uh doing some of her work outside next and some of the they would go out and next here's bella she's doing her school work next bella helping cook washing dishes she's washing dishes they don't have running water well uh they actually this they do here but they have to conserve as much water as possible so they'll put some of that water in a pot right next all right so this is that that same evening back in the mountains the first service uh we're heading up to the to the church and uh that we're gonna have and they were gonna have a whole we're gonna hold a three-day campaign three-day campaign and the first meeting was going to be at this brother's house that they wanted to also dedicate and so that's where we were heading up right here it was probably about a 15-minute walk from the house where we were staying that i just showed you to that place next but you know you have to go through all the mud and making sure your bible doesn't doesn't fall oh this is back down vegetables yes yeah they they grow beans they grow different vegetables as well this is zoe she's uh these are green beans next next all right so this is uh the the the service that up there in the mountains in los angeles that first night next this is the brother's house if you notice there was a brother sitting up here in the corner after i had preached that night that brother had never been around message believers before he'd always been to denominational churches and he was well versed in the scriptures and and and so after the service i talked to him because i had mentioned about a prophet i had mentioned you know i mentioned brother branham i mentioned you know god sent a prophet in this day and so he wanted to know what that was all about and so i got to testify about him i got to testify the message to him and uh gave him a a church age book in spanish and so we're just trusting that the lord is doing the work in his heart because he was very well he was very interested in in in what was what was being said so next [Applause] is i was just telling them you know it's you know when you're when your car is is broken and when you you know it's much better to be serving the lord than than having a nice car and all these things if you have god in your heart you know next all right so this is brother ely and so the reason why he's holding here two phones and and we had to get in certain little spots just to be able to get some signals because this is the brother that i would go to the radio station and to the tv station to preach with so even though we were all the way up there what they would do is they would the radio station would pipe in to through whatsapp and so i would preach all the way from up there to other areas in that in that uh in the general in that vicinity and would preach the gospel you know for about 30 minutes on the phone so next all right so this is the next day and uh we were the brothers made a little tarp outside and uh we had a service there that evening next go ahead next brother appreciate the brothers in the back uh i just nice to be able to have the service was so nice right there in front of that view it was beautiful but that night we had a lot of rain and so a lot of the people that were standing outside they had to end up coming inside and so we were we were crammed in and we were still getting wet because i mean the the the rain would gut on those tarps and they'd get heavy and then just so it was uh next [Applause] [Music] [Music] all right all right this is towards the end of the service i didn't preach that night uh brother ali had preached that night next all right back down back back back where the girls were at they were still washing dishes [Laughter] next and they were making them sweet too next they would also get on on top of tree climb trees and pick the fruit that was on the trees i don't know exactly what the huh jujuga was the name of that fruit and it was almost like a small pear and it was good zoe fell off that tree but she was okay all right so one of the mornings here we got up i got i got up this is their kitchen and this is what they had there they were gonna have for for lunch that that that morning they had the chickens already killed look at those legs it's not like chicken legs here those things were that is some tough meat because them chickens you know they're they're they're eating out in the yard and everything and so they're they're much stronger and and no hormones or anything like that it was good it was good flavored meat it was just much much tougher so if you're used to eating kfc you're going to think oh my god it's nasty but it's much healthier i could show you that all right next all right this is back down with christine and then we're at they were heading uh out that day uh they were gonna visit uh some people and also head to church that evening because this was on a wednesday you could keep playing it just kind of get an idea of what the area looked like in the roads all right next all right this is one of the sisters there that they we had fellowship with she's gonna get married soon next it's bella sporting a new hat she says she hated this picture but i needed to put it in [Laughter] next all right so this is at the sister's house this dog apparently loved zoey so much she when zoe was leaving that day the dog was like going crazy she didn't he didn't want her to leave i don't know like he took a love for zoe and apparently he loves children and so he was barking and everything i have video of that but not here but just wanted to point that out i thought that was funny next all right that night they went to service they went to church and the brother that i was up with up in the mountains brother elie the one that was holding the two phones that's his dad his dad was preaching there that that that evening at the church down in katakanas next all right next all right and this is brother this is brother margarito the brother that that minister wonderful brother we've had good fellowship with him just he's a pastor as well next all right this is uh back up in the mountains and if you see this site here in the bathroom it's beautiful sight this is a beautiful sight this is this is wonderful i mean the floor might be dirty and then that toilet is wet that toilet seat but hey just clean it up just dry it up as good as it can and have at it next [Laughter] and you got nowhere else to go all right sometimes you get so hungry so hungry and there's so much chicken up there that everything seems to just be looking like chicken this is a rock inside the ground this is not a chicken uh chicken leg this is a rock and i we were as we were walking i happened to uh like that looks just like a chicken leg i had to take a picture of it all right all right this is the toilet again it's like i said that's a beautiful sight to me compared to some of the other places we went that last night there up in the mountains we had um we had a last service more people came from different places and uh this is brother natividad's church the brother the brother who's building the new church next to it and we had service that night i preached on blind bartimaeus and the people were just so so blessed we had a prayer line afterwards and and uh gave out a lot of the prayer cloths that we have here there and so next and and you notice that a lot of the a lot of just pause it for a moment a lot of the churches there you know they split the sisters they have them sit on one side and then the brothers on the other side and this most of the churches that's how they do it next [Music] this is me there in the little study getting ready to come out and uh i was i was just right above me there was this light because you know a lot of bugs coming to the light and everything and there's these little uh these little bees flying around there and i was like hurry up and call me because i had them little bees flying around me and i was doing my best to just stay concentrated on the on the on the word and what i was studying but yeah you had all these little bugs uh just flying around next all right this is uh me preaching as you you can see i'm preaching with my with the muddy boots on and and that's fine they expect that over there you know next [Music] a true faith will help [Music] are you going to stay with the word are you going to stay with what god said about you or are you just going to just hunker down and be a coward [Music] to the saving of the soul all right next and then afterwards uh we had just me leading songs a little song after after preaching next all right this is brother like eliakin's family the brother that we stayed in in their house and they send their greetings to you all as well next this brother right here this is his son and uh just pause it for a moment that that they went to go hunt for uh wild hogs that that morning and he they just go out and hunt wild hogs and deer and everything and uh and they could not catch a hog that day but then they they went the following day but that was the day that we were gonna go we were leaving and they they caught a couple of deers so they were gonna give us some deer meat from up there but we never got to eat any but uh next like i said they they make their own coffee and so that's then right there toasting the coffee beans um everything they have to do by hand she's here and then you see how it's getting darker and i never knew how why coffee beans would get dark like that but that's the reason why is because because of the toasting they put sugar on in it and i asked her why did they they do that and she said it's it's to give it like a little camera a camera lies look to it but it's not to sweeten it doesn't make the coffee bean sweet next and then that's them getting ready to grind it and uh they had me grinding as well and uh i don't see how that sister could keep i mean that's tough it's tough but she's getting ready too uh we brought some of that coffee that batch right there that she's making right there they gave it to me in a bag and we brought it and we've been drinking it next you can see how it looks caramelized like a little camera that's because of the sugar and no well i mean it is burnt but that's that's how that's how they like it all right that's the that's brother natividad's family this is this is he has thir he has 13 children this is just only this is just only some of them you pray for this little boy because the other day he uh he he was holding a machete and he fell he fell down and the machete went over to his eye and almost took his eye out he sent me the pictures but uh but uh he's getting better now his eye puffed up luckily he the the doctor said that he he didn't lose his eye so his eyes gonna get better but it could have been worse than hit next all right now we got it give me another 10 more minutes so right now it's about all right this is when we were leaving the mountain and uh and we're walking back down trekking back down next evening yeah i wanted to show that because if we found this horse on their way and and it was a what is that called one the brandon and the brandon is bella so i thought that was funny actually it's much trickier because now you're going down and you can slide much much easier and so uh that has accumulated believe it or not i was more sore going down than i was going up so on the way down we found this this little guy and uh i don't know what it's called but it apparently they just fall off the trees and hopefully you're you're hoping that no nothing none of them falls up because if they do it's got a really powerful bite but just keep playing it the brother picks it up on the stick i mean look it's feisty and it's got like these these red pads as as their feet and he picks it up and he starts showing it to us up close and he holds it there and then the brother elise like okay all right don't get it too close now but uh it's pretty but apparently it it's got a very powerful bike next all right so this is why when we got we got home back down to the where christine and the girls were staying at next uh next all right so then that same day uh we i got cleaned up we got cleaned up and uh and then quickly we had to leave out to go to our next area where we were gonna preach and that was it it was about an hour and a half away in an area called kulmi and that's very typical just a lot of ranchers there you see a lot of cows just walking on the roads next [Music] um there's some of the motorcycles that are that they use there a lot those are the motorcycles there sister monica we're talking about next all right this is uh one of the sisters uh sister reina she's one of the pastor's wife there in that area next hard-working sister you pray for her because she's been having healthcare on our way there we stopped by the radio station and i was there preaching on the radio and then after here we went to all right and this is on the way to the church all right this is me getting ready to come out now i was already not feeling good i was already i was already i was getting sick this is where i started getting sick because when we all came down from the mountain i don't know what what it was but a lot of the people that went up there we came back down and got sick we got fever and and so i was already starting to feel something there that night when i that i had to preach and uh i was already getting feverish but i just went ahead and preached anyhow next and this is the service that night next brother margarito's church sister reina next [Music] [Music] i can't remember what it was that she was she was asking for [Music] we're just praying for them next next all right so they're in that area in that and the house and brother margarito's house they have this parrot over there and uh he's holding a piece of tortilla they give him a tortilla and uh next the beautiful bird so the next day after that service that night the next day we had like a little mini service there at his house and i i was just everything i could do to just just stay just stay because i was already having a fever there next and that evening i was supposed to preach at their church but i that's the one that's the service that i didn't get to preach at because i was just so sick i couldn't preach next all right there at the house bella was helping uh they were helping a fix one of the uh sister's stoves this is a little stove and so they were using uh mud help fix this fix the stove having fun something that that that she needed to have done and it's play-doh so bella took part in doing that next all right there's the parrot he's eating a cassava yucca [Music] next all right and then we're gonna have lunch and they're now watch this watch this y'all watch this [Laughter] i didn't know this video existed until last night yeah we were looking at it and i saw that out there we got to show them that [Laughter] that was a christina and the sister they were there plucking out the all right so that day that day when i was feeling bad i still told brother margarito i said yeah let's go to the radio let's preach you know but i mean you can already look i could already i was already i was sick and i was just trying to keep my word is what i told him i'd do next but after we left here we were going to the radio station just pause it for a moment we went to the r we were going to radio station i just had to tell brother my god my god i'm sorry you're going to have to take it i can't do it and so he said that's fine brother don't worry about it all right while we were there in the city uh christine was with me and we bought this sister a a stroller she she she that's her baby she has down syndrome [Music] and she always everywhere she goes she's carrying her and she's how old how old is she christine she's six years old and so the girl has problems and she's always that sister is always holding her carrying her everywhere so we told her that we would buy her a stroller and so we bought her stroller and that's that's us giving her the stroller there she was so thankful for it too next all right well i'm gonna stop it there we'll do part two another time it's getting late [Applause] we have we still have nicaraguan costa rica we're still in honduras [Laughter] but uh i appreciate all of their prayers um every get for the trip and uh and um there were many souls i believe they were blessed a lot of uh later on i was getting it was in this set of pictures we were able to baptize seven people originally it was going to be about three or four people they were going to be baptized but as we were baptizing some more people wanted to come and get baptized and so they it was just we had a wonderful time and then before we left before we left come to come back home to the states the in costa rica two more brothers wanted to get baptized and we didn't get to baptize them but they got that the word touched them so much that it led them want to want to get baptized they told they told the pastor there that that they were really blessed with the word that i had preached there that night and it really spoke to their heart and it led them to baptism you know they wanted to get baptized so there's another brother there that's going to be baptized that be baptizing them probably already has so we just thank god for for because you know we just we just all we do is just lay out the net you know that's all we can do and uh and let god do the rest amen and when god does the work he does it perfectly when we try to do it we might fail it may it may hit and miss but when
