[8:04] seats brother uh Tim cross will be with
[8:07] us this weekend
[8:08] and we'll have regular services

[8:15] they'll be back Monday afternoon so just
[8:17] remember them in prayer
[8:19] safe travels
[8:21] and keep in prayer to meetings this
[8:24] weekend the the regular service and just
[8:27] come expect it
[8:29] so tonight I just want to take a little
[8:32] scripture
[8:33] um
[8:33] and and read from Revelation chapter
[8:36] four
[8:37] and uh so let's just go to the altar
[8:40] before we look into the scripture Lord
[8:41] God we're so grateful to be able to
[8:43] gather here tonight Lord and and look
[8:45] into your word and we just we ask Lord
[8:47] that you'll just move Among Us here
[8:49] tonight Lord Jesus and that you'll feel
[8:51] that Liberty Lord to to speak to our
[8:53] hearts Lord Jesus and that we'll hear
[8:55] that voice speaking to us Lord Lord not
[8:57] my voice Lord but when yours speaks Lord
[8:59] and things begin to change Lord I pray
[9:02] Lord that you'll just feel at Liberty
[9:04] and move Among Us here tonight Lord and
[9:05] just make it a special night we ask and
[9:08] pray in your name
[9:10] um
[9:11] so Revelation chapter 4 says in verse
[9:13] we'll just read verses one and two it
[9:15] says after this I looked and behold a
[9:18] door was opened in heaven and the first
[9:20] voice which I heard was as it were of a
[9:22] trumpet talking with me which said come
[9:24] up hither and I sh I will show you thee
[9:26] things which must be Hereafter and
[9:29] immediately I was in the spirit and
[9:30] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[9:33] one sat on the throne you may be seated
[9:35] the Lord at his Blessing to the reading
[9:37] of the word
[9:38] I think uh you know if you go back into
[9:41] Revelation chapter four is a pretty
[9:42] short little chapter there it's only got
[9:44] a few verses but if you read that it
[9:45] sets up a just a wonderful Sublime scene
[9:48] that uh that maybe maybe tonight if we
[9:51] could just take take ourselves and put
[9:53] ourselves in the position of John there
[9:55] because we know brother brother Brown
[9:56] said that John represents us and he's
[9:59] he's seeing that uh I would think that
[10:02] that John uh got a kind of a preview of
[10:05] everything that everything that we go
[10:06] through and the whole scene unfolding
[10:08] there for him and oh you know if you
[10:11] think if you look back and think about
[10:13] John's life how that there he was at the
[10:15] cross when Jesus told him that you know
[10:17] you need to take care of Mary a woman
[10:20] behold your son son behold your your
[10:22] mother and uh and and Mary went and
[10:24] began to live with John and John take
[10:27] took care of her and and the tradition
[10:29] says that John started up a little uh a
[10:32] little uh he began to write down the the
[10:35] Bible that we read here today even now
[10:39] began to compile all the different books
[10:41] together and and he started getting in
[10:43] trouble because the uh that the emperor
[10:45] said he got wind that he was saying that
[10:48] you need to worship somebody other than
[10:49] the emperor call somebody else uh God
[10:52] and so they got so mad at him that they
[10:54] tried to bowl him on oh but you see he
[10:56] he had a power on the inside that they
[10:59] couldn't bull it out of him and then uh
[11:02] they said well the only thing we can do
[11:04] is we're going to put him in put him on
[11:06] this island all by himself where he had
[11:08] there was other prisoners I'm sure out
[11:10] on this island and all the snakes and
[11:12] all the different kind of things on that
[11:13] island that it's a real miserable
[11:15] situation but in that miserable
[11:17] situation God began to speak to John
[11:20] and so tonight I want to take a little
[11:22] topic of come up higher and you know God
[11:26] God I I think in this day God always
[11:28] wants us to keep moving up higher and a
[11:30] lot of times he'll get you into a spot
[11:32] where you just saw down and you think
[11:34] everything's against you but yeah yeah
[11:36] like like John out on that on that on
[11:38] that island all by himself uh it seemed
[11:41] like he was nobody cared about him God
[11:44] maybe he thought in moments that God had
[11:46] forgotten about him that like is my life
[11:49] really supposed to be wound up and out
[11:51] here on this island I'm supposed to be
[11:53] preaching I've got all this Revelation
[11:54] I've been with Jesus and God put him out
[11:57] on that island so he can speak to him
[11:59] and isn't that how sometimes God wants
[12:01] to do us sometimes he wants to get you
[12:03] into a place where it seems you see it
[12:05] all all dejected and seems like
[12:07] everything ain't going right and God
[12:09] will get you into a place where he can
[12:10] begin to speak to you oh when when you
[12:13] hear the voice of God the voice of God
[12:15] begins to speak to you and woo you and
[12:17] begins to show you things that's greater
[12:19] than anything he anything that the world
[12:22] can give anything any kind of rough
[12:24] times any kind of tribulations it trumps
[12:27] everything you see and you see I think I
[12:30] think that I hear that brother that
[12:31] Jesus was telling
[12:33] trying to show to John that that he
[12:35] wants us to keep going up to think that
[12:38] John that John could look up and see to
[12:40] look up and see a door open up in heaven
[12:42] now if you would just kind of set the
[12:44] set the the stage here that he looked
[12:46] and he saw a door opened up in heaven
[12:48] think about what John was looking at
[12:50] that he was looking at us at a at a
[12:52] painting lay there before him a film
[12:54] strip like it was and he saw he saw the
[12:56] bride gone and he saw that the bride had
[13:00] made herself ready and she was gone oh
[13:03] you know sitting here tonight it seems
[13:04] like sometimes things are rough and
[13:06] things things are you're going life is
[13:08] hard but one day one day the bride is
[13:11] going to be gone one day you ain't gonna
[13:13] be here no more I want to think that in
[13:16] spite of all the heartaches and
[13:18] struggles the all the ups and downs of
[13:20] life one day you're gonna be gone oh and
[13:24] I I think it's just surely it's just
[13:26] right around the corners you can you can
[13:28] see all around the earth the spirit is
[13:30] being poured out on All Flesh as the
[13:32] Bible said but there's a people that
[13:34] have a revelation of their God there's a
[13:36] people that have heard the voice of God
[13:39] and one day we're going to be going to
[13:40] surely it's it's just got to be right
[13:43] around the corner one day we'll turn
[13:44] around and we'll see we'll see Grandma
[13:46] walking through the kitchen one day
[13:48] we'll turn around and we'll see somebody
[13:49] that we love coming through the door and
[13:52] we'll say we've arrived we've made it
[13:54] now it's the hour that I'm in looking
[13:56] for the uh the time that John saw back
[13:59] there when he was in that dark spot in
[14:01] his life on the Isle of Patmos we were
[14:03] rolling around with all the lizards and
[14:05] all the snakes and all the the heat the
[14:07] heat baking them in that sun but yet in
[14:10] that moment God was able to show him a
[14:12] preview of what we're coming to
[14:14] you see I believe I still believe in a
[14:16] Rapture I still believe I still believe
[14:19] that we're marching towards something
[14:20] that's what we're we're going we're
[14:22] every day every step we take
[14:26] faith is being built up higher and
[14:28] higher until one day we're going to see
[14:31] an open door we're gonna we're gonna see
[14:34] that Open Door by Revelation by eyes of
[14:36] faith and brother Brown will say you
[14:38] said the first three chapters of
[14:39] Revelation is about the church oh you
[14:41] think the first three chapters that John
[14:44] saw rolling before him in the vision of
[14:46] of all the church ages and all the
[14:48] sermons preached and all the messengers
[14:50] coming and all those things happening
[14:51] the first three chapters is about the
[14:53] church and the message and the angels of
[14:55] the church and then she disappears right
[14:57] there in the third chapter and she
[14:59] doesn't appear again until the 19th
[15:01] Chapter and the 19th Chapter she returns
[15:03] and between this time God is dealing
[15:06] with the Jews you know in Revelation 19
[15:08] it says let us be glad and rejoice and
[15:10] give honor to him for the marriage of
[15:12] the Lamb has come and his wife hath made
[15:14] herself ready
[15:16] but to her was granted that she should
[15:18] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[15:21] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[15:23] of saints ought to think that right now
[15:25] right sitting here in this building
[15:26] there's a bride that's getting herself
[15:28] ready that's clothing herself that's
[15:30] that's the reason you're here tonight on
[15:32] a Wednesday night in the middle of the
[15:33] week that's the reason you're you've
[15:35] come that's because something's drawing
[15:37] you you you want to be made ready you
[15:39] want to get ready you want to be clothed
[15:41] in the righteousness I see your bride's
[15:43] gotta the bride's got to prepare herself
[15:45] she's got to get the clothes off she's
[15:46] got to yield herself she's got a She's
[15:49] Gotta She's Gotta make sure that she's
[15:51] clothed right but be prepared like like
[15:54] you know brother I'm always told that
[15:55] story of the the uh the young man that
[15:58] uh the son of the or the grandson or
[16:00] whatever of the armor of meat packing
[16:02] how he he proposed to that little girl
[16:04] and he made her that promise that one
[16:06] day I'm coming I'm coming back for you
[16:08] and she knew she was hanging on his word
[16:10] she said I'm not worthy I couldn't make
[16:13] a wife to a man like you said because
[16:15] you are used to great things and I know
[16:17] nothing about them I'm poor
[16:19] he said but you are my choice oh so can
[16:22] we put ourselves in that situation
[16:24] tonight that there's there's nothing
[16:26] great about us there's nothing that we
[16:27] can boast of but God made he come down
[16:31] and he chose us he chose us before the
[16:33] foundation of the world and brother Adam
[16:35] said you know you wasn't worthy to be a
[16:37] Christian but you know there wasn't
[16:38] there wasn't nothing you could ever do
[16:40] but he just chose you see it's his
[16:42] goodness his Mercy that he chose you you
[16:45] didn't choose him you know he chose you
[16:47] that's all to think that God God chose
[16:50] you before the founder he knew before
[16:52] the foundation of the world that you
[16:53] would want it that your desire would be
[16:56] for him
[16:57] you never chose him because he wasn't
[16:59] the one that was lost but he chose you
[17:01] because you were the one that needed
[17:02] saving he chose you and brother said he
[17:05] said don't look at your clothes he's
[17:06] telling the story I don't look at your
[17:08] clothes I look at what you are
[17:10] oh thank God that God don't look at our
[17:13] backgrounds he didn't look at where we
[17:14] come from and all our failures and
[17:16] faults and everything but he looks at
[17:18] our faith in him he's looking at what
[17:20] he's made us he's looking at his thought
[17:22] about us before the foundation of the
[17:24] world and he said will you marry me and
[17:26] finally the agreement was made and he
[17:28] said one year from this day I will
[17:30] return you be ready
[17:32] oh you know you tonight you got a
[17:34] promise like that he said he's coming
[17:36] back he said he's coming for you he said
[17:39] one day one day there's going to be a
[17:42] day when the church is gone when the
[17:44] bride is gone and she said he said have
[17:46] that wedding garment on for I will
[17:48] return and marry you right here on these
[17:51] grounds and I'll take you to Chicago to
[17:53] Outer Drive there well you'll have a
[17:55] castle to live in and all this
[17:57] dishwashing will be over and things then
[18:00] but you see that's what John was looking
[18:02] at down through in in the first couple
[18:05] of chapters of book of The Book of
[18:06] Revelation he was looking at a church
[18:08] going through all the dishwashing and
[18:10] all the all the stuff all the heartaches
[18:12] and all the sermons preached and all the
[18:14] song sung and all those things but then
[18:17] one day he saw a church gone he looked
[18:20] up and he saw his eyes was turned from
[18:23] Patmos up to the heavens and he saw that
[18:25] a church had been raptured and I want to
[18:27] declare you tonight one day you're going
[18:29] to look around if you ain't ready and
[18:31] the church is going to be gone so if you
[18:33] ain't ready tonight's the night that you
[18:35] can get ready tonight tonight that you
[18:37] can surrender yourself to God because
[18:38] one day the day is going to come when
[18:40] you look around and you wonder where all
[18:42] the saints were that you used to
[18:44] fellowship with you'll wonder what
[18:46] happened when you see the uh the knee in
[18:48] the news about bombs being dropped and
[18:50] all the all the things that we know is
[18:51] coming because they've been prophesied
[18:53] in the Book of Malachi they've been
[18:55] prophesied in Revelation all these
[18:57] chapters that I'm talking about here
[18:58] that one day the plagues will Begin to
[19:00] Fall one day there's coming a time when
[19:03] the church is going to be going are you
[19:04] going to be going with it
[19:12] one of them he promised that he's coming
[19:14] back he promised it
[19:17] you know it takes a lot of prep work to
[19:19] get for a wedding that's what John was
[19:21] looking at and as he saw all the seven
[19:24] Church ages he was looking at all the
[19:25] prep work he was looking at all the
[19:27] proposing he was looking at all the
[19:30] prepared he was looking at the garments
[19:31] being laid out he was looking at all the
[19:34] invitations being sent out the
[19:35] invitation who will come come unto me
[19:38] all you that labor in her heavy laden
[19:40] people being invited to the wedding and
[19:42] some would not come and some would come
[19:44] I wondered tonight if the invitation is
[19:46] given to you would you come would you be
[19:48] willing to come and maybe maybe tonight
[19:49] you're listening on the internet watch
[19:52] it in tonight and I want to ask you
[19:54] tonight when you come if the invitation
[19:56] is given to you come unto me all you the
[19:58] labor to be Laden and I'll give you rest
[20:01] the invocation has been sent out all
[20:03] down through the seven Church ages but
[20:06] after all these things after all those
[20:09] things that John was looking at after
[20:10] all the songs have been so you think
[20:12] about one day there won't be any more
[20:14] special song one day all the specials
[20:17] that have been sung all the sermons that
[20:19] have been preached will be over after
[20:21] sermons have been preached and and seven
[20:24] churches messages have preached their
[20:25] sermon and all the messages have gone
[20:27] forth and after Hearts have been won and
[20:30] after lives have been lived
[20:32] after testimonies have been given one
[20:35] day one day the bride is going to be
[20:38] gone
[20:40] after all those you know I surely surely
[20:43] we can see that there's brother Brown
[20:44] would say over and over again there's
[20:45] nothing between right now right now
[20:47] where you're standing there's nothing
[20:48] that has to happen between us between
[20:51] right now and the coming of the Lord
[20:53] sometimes we we keep trying to put
[20:55] things in in front of it and say well
[20:56] this has got to happen this has got to
[20:58] happen there ain't nothing else has to
[20:59] happen what's going to happen what's the
[21:02] only thing that's going to happen is the
[21:03] bride has got to prepare herself the
[21:05] bride has got to be made ready that's
[21:07] the only requirement there's nothing
[21:09] else got to happen sometimes we gotta we
[21:11] want to place things in front of that
[21:12] and say well brother Brown's got to come
[21:14] back to preach some more sermons but he
[21:16] already gave us everything we have need
[21:17] of well something else has got to happen
[21:19] you know sometimes we get in our mind
[21:21] well well if I can be if I could just
[21:23] live in a concrete house like they do in
[21:25] Nicaragua then might be ready for the
[21:27] rapture
[21:28] let me let me preach on that for a
[21:30] little bit
[21:31] listen you don't need a concrete house
[21:33] to go in the Rapture when we were down
[21:35] there one thing that really struck me
[21:36] was uh and that that scripture that I
[21:38] read uh I I it didn't come to mind right
[21:41] now but but everybody all around the
[21:43] world was going through the same
[21:44] problems we're fighting the same devil
[21:47] no matter where we are and if you're
[21:49] living in a concrete house you ain't
[21:50] fighting a different devil you're still
[21:52] fighting the same devil and we were down
[21:54] there and we went over we on that little
[21:55] island of omittepi we went over and and
[21:57] we visited with a little brother who had
[21:58] stopped coming to church you just think
[22:00] well uh if I was living in a concrete
[22:03] house I would be more faithful no they
[22:05] still got the same problems people still
[22:08] not coming to church down there in the
[22:10] air condition you think well if I was
[22:12] living with a little dirt floor then I'd
[22:13] be able to overcome but they got people
[22:15] I was talking to some of the ministers
[22:17] down there and they said you can steal
[22:18] down there the little kids will go up
[22:20] onto a top of the hill with their phone
[22:22] and they'll be looking at stuff that
[22:24] they ain't supposed to look at just like
[22:25] they do in the United States oh but if I
[22:28] had a dirt floor then I could really
[22:30] overcome know what you need need to
[22:32] overcome is you need the word of God God
[22:34] has given us the greatest thing it could
[22:37] ever be given for you to overcome you
[22:39] don't need a dark floor the concrete has
[22:41] to overcome you need the word of God the
[22:43] blood of the Lamb to cover you to you to
[22:45] overcome and that's the only thing that
[22:48] you need to get out of here you don't
[22:49] need hard times and rough times to be a
[22:52] Christian you don't need so you don't
[22:54] need nothing else but the word isn't
[22:56] that what God what was unfolded to us in
[22:58] the fifth and The Sixth Seal that there
[23:00] was the word of God was sufficient to
[23:03] justify you and sanctify you to cover
[23:06] you up with his blood and to purify you
[23:08] that's all you need is the word of God
[23:12] and after seven Church ages and after
[23:14] seven Messengers John looking at God
[23:17] moving and building his bride down
[23:18] through seven Church ages by what by the
[23:21] word by the word and some people in the
[23:23] seven churches were rich and some people
[23:26] were poor some people had a lot and some
[23:28] people had a little but they all had the
[23:30] word because that's what you overcome
[23:32] with you ever come by the blood of the
[23:34] lamb and the word of your testimony
[23:36] that's what you overcome with oh if we
[23:39] could realize that God has given us the
[23:41] greatest weapon in our hands to defeat
[23:43] to overcome everything that the devil
[23:46] throws at us and John was looking at a
[23:48] process down through the seven churches
[23:50] is a process that God was taking the
[23:53] bride through a process he was taking
[23:55] him from Ephesus all the way up to the
[23:57] layout to see you until they would be
[23:58] formed into the village that he could
[24:00] come and manifest himself in the for in
[24:03] the purity of of his word
[24:05] and John was looking at that
[24:07] he was looking at a process he saw in
[24:10] Revelations 4 that process was completed
[24:12] he was looking at Redemption finished
[24:15] after these things
[24:17] after the church age and all this from
[24:20] here after now will be pertaining
[24:21] brother Brown said will take place on
[24:23] Earth after the Rapture of the church
[24:25] see you after the Rapture this is going
[24:27] back now to pick up Israel after the
[24:29] church age after the ages of the church
[24:32] and they the church never appears again
[24:34] until Revelation the 19th Chapter when
[24:37] she returns again with her bridegroom
[24:40] after all of that
[24:42] after all of that you know you think
[24:43] about what John looked at all of that
[24:46] was happening right now
[24:48] all of that songs being sung and sermons
[24:52] being preached and testimonies being
[24:54] given and lives being won and people
[24:56] coming to the Altar and young people
[24:58] going to youth camps and and some giving
[25:01] of their heart to the Lord and some not
[25:03] giving their heart to the Lord some
[25:04] heart being turned
[25:06] softened up and some hearts being turned
[25:09] to stone and all those things but after
[25:12] all that
[25:14] the bride was gone
[25:17] you know the Book of Revelation didn't
[25:18] open up with this scene in Revelation 4.
[25:20] it took a while to get there
[25:22] it took a while if we could just look
[25:24] think about your own life it takes a
[25:26] while it takes a while a while for God
[25:28] to form himself into In His Image and
[25:30] you to to mold you into the place where
[25:33] he can use you it takes a while it takes
[25:35] what does it take it takes seven
[25:36] candlesticks
[25:37] seven Church ages
[25:39] seven warnings all those warning warning
[25:42] constantly warning seven Promises to the
[25:45] Overcomers all those things being played
[25:48] out seven stars that God was sending
[25:50] Seven Stars with seven messages
[25:52] seven messages and all those things and
[25:54] now the church is gone
[25:56] and The Last Enemy has been defeated
[25:59] you know on on the day of Pentecost when
[26:02] Peter began to preach his message he
[26:04] gave that promise that one day one day
[26:06] every enemy is going to be defeated
[26:10] you know there's a promise to that you
[26:11] can lay hold to that if you've got an
[26:13] enemy besetting you in your life
[26:16] you just take God at his word and you'll
[26:18] see that enemy to be defeated
[26:20] uh Peter was quoting Psalm 110 when he
[26:23] said on the day of Pentecost Peter was
[26:24] quoting it when he said the Lord said
[26:26] unto my Lord sit out in my right hand
[26:27] until I make thine enemies thy footstool
[26:29] until every enemy is under his feet
[26:33] every enemy is under your feet
[26:35] and what's The Last Enemy is death
[26:37] oh you see that's what John saw in
[26:40] Revelation chapter four that every enemy
[26:42] had been defeated somebody had overcome
[26:45] death somebody had overcome every
[26:47] sickness somebody had overcome covert
[26:49] somebody had overcome cancer somebody
[26:51] had overcome tumors somebody had
[26:53] overcome every everything every foul
[26:55] idea that the devil could put in their
[26:56] minds somebody had overcome pornography
[26:58] somebody had overcome or you you just
[27:01] listened somebody overcome alcohol
[27:03] somebody overcome cigarettes and he was
[27:05] looking at that somebody overcame
[27:08] because there's a promise in the Bible
[27:10] and Hebrews chapter 10 it says but this
[27:12] man after he had offered one sacrifice
[27:14] for sins forever set down on the right
[27:15] hand of God from his more forth
[27:17] expecting until his enemies be made his
[27:20] footstool I think that God that there is
[27:23] no enemy too difficult there is no enemy
[27:26] too difficult tonight
[27:27] on this Wednesday night she's kind of
[27:30] sitting here trying to stay awake trying
[27:32] to listen after you've been working hard
[27:33] all day working hard all week There's No
[27:36] enemy too difficult
[27:38] every enemy has already been defeated oh
[27:42] you think that should give us Faith here
[27:43] tonight that Christ defeated every enemy
[27:46] on the cross if we can just lay hold of
[27:48] that in faith and believe that the
[27:50] mighty conqueror has already gone before
[27:52] us and he's already conquered in Exodus
[27:55] chapter 14 it says the Lord shall fight
[27:57] for you and ye shall hold your peace
[27:59] the Lord shall fight for you and you
[28:01] ain't got to say nothing and you ain't
[28:03] got to do nothing the Lord is the one
[28:05] that fights our battles
[28:07] in Deuteronomy 28 the Lord shall cause
[28:10] thine enemies that rise up against thee
[28:12] to be smitten before thy face oh oh if
[28:14] we could keep these scriptures in front
[28:15] of us it would give us confidence the
[28:18] Lord shall cause thine enemies to be
[28:19] spent before thy face they shall come
[28:22] out against thee one way and flee before
[28:24] these seven ways down through seven
[28:28] Church ages the Lord has routed the
[28:30] enemy and ever turned he's caused the
[28:32] enemy to flee at the word of the
[28:34] testimony of the of Believers that will
[28:36] take the message of their day and
[28:38] believe what God sent to them
[28:41] you see if you believe what God said to
[28:44] you one day you're going to be gone
[28:46] if you could just take what God Said and
[28:48] lay hold to it one day you're going to
[28:50] be gone
[28:51] but now after all those things John is
[28:54] looking at a scene where the bride has
[28:57] gone up
[28:58] and death has been defeated oh you I
[29:01] just want to meditate tonight on what
[29:03] John saw that he saw the bride going up
[29:05] not down
[29:06] oh if our conversation could be like
[29:07] that it doesn't it just kind of get you
[29:09] down when you get around somebody and
[29:10] they're they're just they just they're
[29:12] they're talking down and they're they're
[29:14] punching down all the time well I don't
[29:16] like the way you look and I don't like
[29:17] this and I don't like the way the church
[29:19] is run and I don't like all but you this
[29:21] I thank God that we've got a message
[29:23] that pulls us up we've got a positive
[29:26] gospel you know brother said a Christian
[29:28] is an optimist why because we're always
[29:30] going up you always got to be going up I
[29:33] I believe I believe it's possible all
[29:36] things are possible to them to believe
[29:37] but this is not defeated bride we don't
[29:40] have a message of defeat we have a
[29:42] message of cheer to build us up we have
[29:44] a message that keeps us going up keeps
[29:46] us moving on up that there's no going
[29:48] back there's no turning around there's
[29:51] no stopping there's no pausing we're
[29:54] constantly climbing we're going up you
[29:56] can you can't keep the bride down that's
[29:58] what the Holy Ghost is for that if if
[30:00] you've got the Holy Ghost this afternoon
[30:02] and you were to die on the way home you
[30:05] can't keep it down down because one of
[30:07] these days you're coming up from the
[30:08] graves one of these days you're coming
[30:10] up you can't keep the Holy Ghost down
[30:12] it's coming up sooner or later and one
[30:15] day this Holy Ghost is going to take the
[30:17] bride into the skies she's going to
[30:19] leave one day it's coming you can't keep
[30:22] her in the ground you can't keep her
[30:23] down because she's got a positive word
[30:26] she's got a positive confession that's
[30:28] why I believe tonight that the bride is
[30:30] going up we're coming up we're going up
[30:33] that's where the word is taking you the
[30:35] word is taking you up you know the
[30:37] word's not taking you down the word is
[30:39] taking you up into fellowship with him
[30:41] and I thank God that we don't have all
[30:43] drawn up Sourpuss message that tells us
[30:45] how bad we are or how miserable we are
[30:48] or how backwards we are or how many
[30:50] problems we got thank God we got a
[30:52] message we got something to preach
[30:54] tonight
[30:55] we don't all the other the other morning
[30:58] I I woke up and I was just laying in bed
[31:00] and I was thinking about all the sermons
[31:02] that have been preached about going
[31:03] around and around Mount Horeb and I
[31:05] began to I began to just meditate about
[31:07] all all the all the fighting and all the
[31:10] stewing and all the going around and
[31:11] around and just you the sermons just
[31:14] being preached over and over again about
[31:15] just being born again over and over and
[31:17] over again and just staying in one spot
[31:19] and I begin to think oh God God please
[31:21] don't don't let us be guilty of the
[31:23] things that the age is past or guilty of
[31:26] if others have been guilty of going
[31:27] around and around Mount Orab and just
[31:29] staying in one spot I I don't want to be
[31:32] guilty of that in my life and I want
[31:34] tonight to challenge you that you'll
[31:36] have a renewed fervor to not go around
[31:38] matter of don't let that be your
[31:39] testimony but let's keep putting one
[31:42] foot in front of the other and press on
[31:44] toward the mark of the high calling in
[31:46] Christ and you know a lot of times
[31:47] you've got to press on you'll get to a
[31:50] place in your life where you just you
[31:51] just feel like I don't know what to do
[31:53] next seems like it's so deep for me I
[31:55] don't know I don't I really understand
[31:57] these deep things but you've got to
[31:59] press on don't stagnate don't just don't
[32:02] just settle down and just keep going
[32:04] around and around that's why I believe
[32:06] we've got a message tonight to preach
[32:08] that we don't have to go around and
[32:10] around in circles we don't have to just
[32:12] keep preaching the same old repent and
[32:14] you must be born again that must be
[32:16] preached but it's we've got to go up
[32:18] we've got to go higher we've got to go
[32:20] on to the Capstone Revelation listen to
[32:22] the Capstone has got to be preached you
[32:24] see where are you getting this from
[32:26] Brother Bob I'm getting it from what
[32:27] Paul said because he's the one that said
[32:30] therefore leaving the principles of the
[32:31] doctrine of Christ let us go on into
[32:34] Perfection let us go on from this little
[32:36] baby form things let's go on into a
[32:38] Capstone understanding let's go on to
[32:40] where we can preach the seals well we
[32:42] don't have to look at our notes let's go
[32:44] on to where we can preach the statue of
[32:46] a perfect man we don't have to keep keep
[32:47] relying back on the on our notes over
[32:50] and over again but preach it not lay it
[32:53] again the foundation of repentance from
[32:54] dead works and the faith or God of the
[32:56] doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of
[32:59] hands and of resurrection of the dead
[33:00] and of Eternal judgment all those things
[33:02] have to be preached but let's go on to
[33:04] perfection
[33:06] oh I surely God did not call me in this
[33:10] age to preach a watered-down gospel of
[33:12] conspiracy theories and fanciful stories
[33:15] and psychology of some good thoughts and
[33:17] ideas on how to be successful and
[33:19] popular or to be happy but God has
[33:21] called us in the hour to preach what
[33:23] brother Branham gave us to preach what
[33:26] brother Brandon preached he cut his
[33:28] message was The Headstone and if God
[33:30] sent the message of The Headstone then
[33:32] that's what we've got to preach
[33:33] somebody's got to preach it somebody's
[33:36] got to preach it sooner or later if the
[33:38] head is Christ and the head has come
[33:40] let's preach it I want to ask you
[33:42] tonight do you believe the seals are
[33:43] open yeah
[33:46] do you believe the head has come
[33:51] you know if you don't believe that then
[33:52] what are you confessing
[33:54] if you don't believe that then you're
[33:56] confessing something that you're
[33:57] confession is something way off in the
[33:59] future or you keep putting things in
[34:01] front of us something something way in
[34:03] front of us one of these days one of
[34:04] these days somebody is going to be able
[34:06] to live it I believe somebody's able to
[34:08] live it now one of these days somebody's
[34:11] going to be able to manifest these
[34:12] virtues no somebody's manifest I believe
[34:15] all around the Earth in Nicaragua and
[34:17] Ecuador and in the jungles everywhere
[34:19] all around in Africa somebody's able to
[34:21] live this and it ain't far off it ain't
[34:24] way off in the future there's a present
[34:26] we have a present God a present tense
[34:28] God that's able to live it right and
[34:30] down
[34:32] man ooh you cheat keeps hearing people
[34:36] preach well you ain't got it I ain't got
[34:37] it nobody ain't got it somebody's got it
[34:42] you ain't got it nobody ain't got it
[34:43] that's see that's a down message I I
[34:46] believe in a message that that's pulling
[34:47] us up somebody's gonna have uh you
[34:50] believe what I'm saying tonight
[34:51] somebody's gonna have this guy I believe
[34:53] this is a gospel where somebody is
[34:55] available to somebody if you own it you
[34:58] can have it
[34:59] I see you tonight if you don't believe
[35:01] if you don't see that the seals are open
[35:03] if you don't truly see the understanding
[35:05] of the seals then that's why it's got to
[35:07] be preached it's got to be priests
[35:10] somebody's got to preach the Book of
[35:12] Revelation somebody's got to preach to
[35:14] these mysterious things and you know I
[35:15] was thinking the other day about how
[35:17] brother Brown said the things that will
[35:18] get a minister a lead up get them astray
[35:20] is women money and popularity and
[35:23] popularity I think is tied in maybe
[35:26] maybe this is my opinion tonight we all
[35:28] just bear with me but I think it's tied
[35:30] in with preaching the Capstone because
[35:32] you preached the Capstone it ain't gonna
[35:33] be popular people want people want to
[35:36] hear a message that'll make you jump
[35:37] around and run up and down the aisles
[35:39] and and get people up at the altar but
[35:41] they don't want to hear they don't want
[35:42] to hear the Book of Revelation they
[35:43] don't want to hear Daniel 70 weeks they
[35:45] don't want to hear any deep things but
[35:47] you see it's deep things that will get
[35:48] you in the Rapture it's deep things what
[35:51] will prepare you and and the bride wants
[35:53] to be clothed the bride wants to be
[35:55] clothed with the righteousness of Christ
[35:56] so it's got to be preached
[35:59] God's got a bride that is going up God's
[36:02] got a bride that is going out of here
[36:04] and that's why John looked and he said
[36:05] in Revelation chapter 4 after this I
[36:07] looked and behold a door was opened in
[36:10] heaven
[36:11] a door was opened in heaven
[36:14] in Revelation chapter 3 verse 8 a
[36:16] promise was given to the Church of
[36:17] Philadelphia I Know Thy Works behold
[36:20] I've sit before thee an open door and no
[36:22] man can shut it for thou Hast a little
[36:24] strength and has kept my word and that's
[36:26] not denying my name aren't you glad for
[36:28] a door that no man can shut for a door
[36:32] that is set before you and anybody is
[36:35] freely available if you believe that
[36:37] that door is sitting there open that you
[36:39] can step through it
[36:41] and no man can shut it oh we thought we
[36:44] sing that song that's joy that I have
[36:46] the world didn't give it to me there was
[36:48] no man that gave me this joy that I got
[36:50] this joy that I got the world can't take
[36:52] it away cause no man no man gave it to
[36:55] me no man can take it away this
[36:57] Revelation that I have the world didn't
[36:59] give it to me and the world can't take
[37:00] it away there's no man that can take
[37:02] away the Revelation I have there's no
[37:04] devil that can take away the Revelation
[37:05] you have there's no man there's no devil
[37:08] there's no body that can shut this door
[37:10] because it's open he said in John
[37:13] chapter 10 I am the door of the sheep
[37:15] all that ever came before me are thieves
[37:17] and robbers but the Sheik did not hear
[37:19] them I am the door by me if any man
[37:22] enter in he shall be saved and shall go
[37:23] in and out and and find Pastor you uh
[37:26] maybe maybe tonight you're wondering
[37:28] what is this door that John's all well
[37:30] this door is Christ because Jesus said I
[37:33] am the door I am the door of the cross
[37:35] in John chapter 14. he said Jesus saith
[37:38] unto him I am the way the truth and the
[37:40] life no man cometh unto the father but
[37:42] by me so if you want to if you want
[37:44] access to God you've got to come through
[37:46] Jesus because he is the door he is the
[37:49] way he is he is the only access to
[37:51] eternal life
[37:54] how you get through that door by faith
[37:57] faith is the thing that opens up the
[37:59] door
[37:59] in Matthew chapter 16 Jesus told Peter
[38:02] he said I'll give unto thee the kings of
[38:03] the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever
[38:05] Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound
[38:07] in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt
[38:08] loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven
[38:10] and boy did Peter loose it on the day of
[38:12] Pentecost when he took those keys on the
[38:14] day of Pentecost and he began to preach
[38:16] the Bible says that then Peter said unto
[38:18] them repent and be baptized every one of
[38:20] you in the name of Jesus Christ I I want
[38:23] to ask you this afternoon how was how
[38:25] was Peter opening up the door how was he
[38:27] unlocking eternal life to all those that
[38:29] were gathered around he was sharing with
[38:31] him a personal revelation of Jesus
[38:32] Christ and the revelation of Jesus
[38:34] Christ will open up the door in every
[38:36] case oh if you've got a revelation of
[38:38] Jesus Christ it'll unlock every mystery
[38:40] it'll unlock every Ever every benefit
[38:43] every promise is laying there in the
[38:45] scripture if you if you can look into
[38:47] the scripture with a revelation of what
[38:49] it says it'll open it up to you brother
[38:51] Ryan said Faith holds the key and the
[38:53] key is scripture Faith takes the little
[38:55] hinges of the scripture and unlocks the
[38:57] glories and good of God out to his
[38:59] people Faith holds the key that unlocks
[39:01] Christ to the people unlocks it reveal
[39:04] it reveals it Faith what's Faith doing
[39:06] faith is unlocking faith is opening up
[39:09] to you a revelation of who Jesus Christ
[39:11] is
[39:13] n't that what the new birth is a
[39:15] revelation a personal revelation to you
[39:17] of who Jesus Christ is
[39:20] I know sometimes that that boggles our
[39:22] mind what what do you mean a revelation
[39:24] of Jesus Christ well see and when he
[39:27] when he begins to open up the scripture
[39:28] to you he'll start from the feet and
[39:30] I'll make his way all the way up to the
[39:32] head until you can see Christ perfectly
[39:35] represented in his word from cover to
[39:36] cover from the beginning to the end from
[39:39] the feet to the head and then he'll
[39:41] reveal to you your the beginning of your
[39:43] journey and the end of your journey
[39:45] what's the end of your journey now what
[39:48] we're talking about Revelation 4 1 that
[39:50] he looked he looked John looked and saw
[39:52] a bride was gone
[39:54] brother Brown said he said to this
[39:55] church age I've set you before an open
[39:57] door talking to them about the Methodist
[39:59] he said to that myth to the Methodist
[40:01] Church age they turned away from it when
[40:03] an organization but I've set before you
[40:05] an Open Door
[40:06] now after they had received
[40:08] sanctification he said I'll put the open
[40:10] door which is the Holy Spirit by one
[40:12] Spirit we are all baptized into one body
[40:14] which is Christ he sent that message
[40:16] before the Methodist church and they
[40:18] turned aside from it they come up to
[40:20] sanctification and refuse the Holy Ghost
[40:22] remember that that Open Door how do you
[40:25] get into Christ by one spirit
[40:27] Holy Spirit which is Christ's Spirit
[40:30] we've entered in not by handshaking not
[40:32] by sprinkling but by one Holy Ghost
[40:34] baptism we are all baptized into one
[40:37] body and made partakers of that body one
[40:40] Holy Ghost baptism into that door
[40:44] so this afternoon do you want Christ if
[40:47] you want Christ just take him at his
[40:49] word I I challenge you to take him in
[40:51] his word and see what happens you take
[40:53] God at his word and something will
[40:55] happen you have faith in God and watch
[40:57] the door open up to you
[40:58] he this door set in heaven that door
[41:00] when he looked up he saw the Lord Jesus
[41:03] he looked up he wasn't looking down he
[41:06] looked up oh if we can just look up keep
[41:09] our eyes on Jesus despite all the all
[41:11] the I know I keep preaching all the
[41:13] weird stuff that's happening there's a
[41:15] lot of weird stuff I was telling my wife
[41:16] I was watching a preacher a Baptist
[41:18] preacher and he was preaching about he
[41:20] got to preaching about how what a
[41:22] blessing it was to look thou on the
[41:24] first row of his church and see a a
[41:26] young couple and and and the ex
[41:30] a man with his ex-wife sitting next to
[41:34] his newly married husband and I thought
[41:37] what uh travesty this we're living in
[41:39] Sodom and Gomorrah and you begin to look
[41:41] around at all the weird things that are
[41:43] happening on the Earth all the weird
[41:44] stuff and you you can get you can get
[41:46] off track if you start doing that but
[41:48] keep you if you keep your eyes on Christ
[41:50] oh I I want to encourage you tonight
[41:52] don't don't set your eyes on the strange
[41:54] things that your neighbors doing or that
[41:56] other people are doing or you see
[41:58] Ministry is doing around the message
[41:59] around the world but just keep your eyes
[42:02] on Christ that's what John was looking
[42:04] up he looked up and he saw Jesus and he
[42:08] his eyes were turned from he was he was
[42:10] looking first at the scene of all those
[42:12] things that are happening on on Earth
[42:15] he was looking at
[42:17] seven Church ages and seven Messengers
[42:20] and preaching their sermons and and
[42:22] songs being sung and testimonies and
[42:24] lives and all those things that we've
[42:26] been going over he was watching he had
[42:29] been his eyes were on Patmos down on
[42:31] that island of looking down at all the
[42:33] all the the Heat and the the snakes and
[42:36] all that stuff going on but then he now
[42:38] he looks up and he sees something went
[42:40] on Earth here these seven churches
[42:42] dialed down through the church ages and
[42:44] then he looked up
[42:45] what was what was going on down through
[42:48] seven Church ages
[42:49] a bride was being called out a bride was
[42:52] being prepared the truth was marching on
[42:56] like that wheel in the middle of the
[42:57] wheel was going with her traveling she's
[43:00] traveling she's moving on
[43:01] and then after he got through seeing the
[43:03] church ages after that after the church
[43:06] ages has ceased he heard a voice
[43:09] that voice was the same voice that that
[43:12] same voice that was walking in the seven
[43:14] golden candlesticks that same voice that
[43:16] was walking in the heaven golden
[43:17] candlesticks in Revelation chapter one
[43:19] it said I was in the spirit on the
[43:21] Lord's day and heard behind me a great
[43:22] voice as of a trumpet and I turned to
[43:25] see the voice that spake with me and
[43:28] being turned I saw seven golden
[43:29] candlesticks
[43:31] that voice where that voice came from
[43:34] that's the one that showed John the
[43:35] mystery of them seven golden
[43:36] candlesticks
[43:39] he's the one he's the one that was
[43:41] holding the Seven Stars
[43:43] he's the one that had the white wig
[43:46] he's the one that had the feet like
[43:47] brass and eyes like fire and all those
[43:50] symbols he's the one that gave the
[43:52] gospel he's the one that gave the
[43:54] message he's the one that's been
[43:56] speaking through those seven Church ages
[43:58] that John was looking at he's the one
[44:00] that spoke through the seven Church age
[44:01] Messengers it's his voice and I want to
[44:04] ask you this question have you heard his
[44:06] voice you know John John was able to
[44:09] recognize that voice he turned he wanted
[44:10] to see that voice because he knew that
[44:12] he had heard that voice before he had he
[44:14] had walked down the shores of Galilee
[44:16] with that voice for three and a half
[44:17] years he knew what that voice sounded
[44:19] like but I wondered tonight sitting here
[44:21] if we'd be able to recognize that voice
[44:23] when the strange Doctrine is preached
[44:25] from behind the pulpit can you say well
[44:27] I don't know I don't recognize that
[44:29] voice or when when you hear the truth
[44:31] being preached can you say something
[44:33] stirs my soul that's that I recognize
[44:36] that voice I know that voice oh you
[44:39] realize one of the greatest gifts there
[44:41] is is to be able to discern not the
[44:43] level of discernment like brother
[44:44] Brandon have but be able to tell the
[44:46] truth tell when something's true oh you
[44:49] realize when you're sitting in church
[44:50] and you can shout amen that's one of the
[44:53] greatest blessings there's a lot of
[44:55] people in the world that can't tell when
[44:57] something's true or not there's a lot of
[44:59] people that can't tell the truth but
[45:00] when you can tell that John could tell
[45:02] that voice he knew that voice
[45:05] John chapter 10 says verily verily I say
[45:08] unto you that he that entereth not the
[45:09] by the door under the Sheepfold book
[45:11] climb with up somewhere some other way
[45:13] the same as a thief and a robber the
[45:15] bridegroom stands at the door and all
[45:17] comes up with an invitation the
[45:19] bridegroom is standing at that door and
[45:21] if you've heard the voice to give you an
[45:24] invitation you've got a right to come to
[45:26] the door and say I have been invited oh
[45:30] you think about when
[45:32] Esther's and Zach just got married and
[45:34] you think about how they they kept
[45:36] begging for all the RSVPs please RSVP
[45:39] I'm inviting you I've given you an
[45:41] invitation now I want to know if you're
[45:44] coming now in the in the old days they
[45:46] get that invitation and they come and
[45:48] they the the the bridegroom will be
[45:50] standing at the door and to receive them
[45:52] and they'd come up and they'd say
[45:55] you if you didn't have an invitation you
[45:57] couldn't come eat it but if you've got
[45:59] an invitation in you go and you go and
[46:03] and John chapter six he said no man
[46:06] could come to me except the Father which
[46:07] has sent me draw him and I will raise
[46:09] him up at the last day there is your
[46:11] invitation no man can come to me except
[46:13] the father oh you see a lot of times we
[46:15] come to church and we hear the
[46:17] preacher's voice and maybe it's a tired
[46:19] Wednesday night Sherman and everybody's
[46:21] like well that's just brother Bob up
[46:22] there but you know my see my voice my
[46:24] voice won't help you none oh but when
[46:26] you hear the father's voice when the
[46:29] father speaks to you and begins to
[46:30] identify with you that this sermon that
[46:32] you hear tonight that's for you that
[46:34] this promise tonight that's for you and
[46:37] you've got an invitation that you can
[46:39] receive it if you want it if you want it
[46:41] you can go through the door of Christ
[46:43] you can come to the door and you see
[46:45] then you can come boldly come boldly to
[46:47] the throne of grace come boldly and say
[46:49] well I've got an invitation why not
[46:52] because you've heard from Brother Wade
[46:53] or from Brother Bob or brother Aaron and
[46:55] brother Louise but I've heard from my
[46:57] father he gave me invitation he said I
[46:59] could come no man could come except the
[47:02] father was just sent me sent me drawing
[47:04] and I'll raise him up at the last today
[47:06] oh but when the father draws when the
[47:08] father not because the Deacon prepped
[47:10] you on the shoulder and said you need to
[47:11] go up to the altar it's time for you to
[47:13] pray not because your mama and daddy
[47:15] tapped you on the shoulder and said you
[47:16] need to go on up there but when God
[47:18] draws you it's written in the prophets
[47:20] and they shall be all taught of God
[47:22] every man therefore that hath heard and
[47:24] hath learned of the father come and
[47:26] doesn't cometh unto me
[47:27] the father told me I was invited have
[47:31] you heard of the father tonight

[47:36] got your invitation come unto me all you
[47:38] that labor and are heavy laden what
[47:40] better invitation than that if you've
[47:41] got if you're lading down with all these
[47:43] burdens and things come come and he'll
[47:45] take them away from him he'll take them
[47:46] off of you he'll give you he'll give you
[47:49] a burden bear they'll walk beside you
[47:50] and help help you along life's way
[47:54] John chapter 16 says these things have I
[47:56] spoken unto you in Proverbs but the time
[47:58] cometh when I shall no more speak unto
[48:00] you in Proverbs but I shall show you
[48:02] plainly of the father of the father see
[48:05] a man can't draw you a man can't call
[48:07] you a man can't give you this imitation
[48:09] this invitation comes from God and when
[48:12] you've got this invitation you can come
[48:13] with confidence the invitation John
[48:16] chapter 4 Jesus answered and said unto
[48:18] her when he was talking to that little
[48:19] woman at the well if thou knew it's the
[48:21] gift of God and who it is that saith to
[48:23] thee give me to drink thou wouldstas
[48:25] have asked of him and he would have
[48:27] given thee Living Water all you think
[48:29] about Jesus talking to that little woman
[48:30] at the well saying if you knew who you
[48:32] were talking to then you would ask me
[48:34] for water that's that's the invitation
[48:37] that I'm talking about tonight if you
[48:38] can recognize who's talking to you
[48:40] tonight that it ain't just some man
[48:42] behind the pulpit that God's speaking to
[48:44] you giving you an invitation to come to
[48:47] come freely
[48:48] foreign
[48:54] the bridegroom has so many guests that
[48:55] he's going to have
[48:57] and he gives out all these invitations
[48:58] he knows he knows he's going to accept
[49:01] you don't want to turn down this
[49:03] invitation
[49:04] an invitation to the marriage Shepherd
[49:06] of the Lamb
[49:07] oh you think about when you're invited
[49:09] to this wedding you come up with your
[49:11] invitation and you you meet the
[49:13] bridegroom at the door he's standing
[49:15] there and he's he's going to give you
[49:16] something what's he going to give you
[49:17] he's going to give you a robe you come
[49:19] up with your invitation I've been
[49:21] invited I have my invitation and he puts
[49:24] his robe around your shoulders and you
[49:25] know what that robe does is it covers up
[49:27] all that past
[49:28] covers up the outside covers up that
[49:31] drug addict that that person that was
[49:33] all living like the world it covers it
[49:35] up
[49:36] the bridegroom stood at the door to
[49:39] receive the invitation and each one that
[49:40] come with an invitation the bridegroom
[49:43] that he he put a robe on everyone that
[49:46] come in as identification put a robe on
[49:49] everyone that's good or bad rich or poor
[49:51] all looked alike this robe is none other
[49:53] than the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:55] that's the robe and it covered up what
[49:58] they're outside had been that road where
[50:00] the holy ghost covers up all your past
[50:02] it covers up all those mistakes you made
[50:04] aren't you aren't you glad for a gospel
[50:05] like this you've got a robe that can
[50:08] cover up all that pass
[50:09] [Applause]
[50:10] oh oh once that pass is covered let's
[50:13] just you can forget about it because
[50:15] God's forgotten about it forget about it
[50:17] because it's already covered he's
[50:19] covered it over oh thank God that we've
[50:21] got a covering like Ruth there when she
[50:22] laid there at the feet of Boaz and she
[50:24] wanted to be covered over and he spread
[50:26] his skirt over her and that was typing
[50:28] the Holy Ghost it covers over all your
[50:30] past to redeem you by the blood of the
[50:32] Lamb to cover you oh if you feel that
[50:34] tug on your heart when the gospel is
[50:35] preaching being preached that's the
[50:37] greatest thing in the world to know that
[50:40] God wants to robe you with his
[50:41] righteousness with the baptism of the
[50:43] Holy Ghost
[50:45] don't matter if you're in Nicaragua or
[50:47] the United States
[50:48] it don't matter if you're rich or poor
[50:50] old or young
[50:52] it doesn't matter
[50:53] there's a robe for whoever has an
[50:55] invitation
[50:57] Whoever has an invitation
[51:00] my brother Adam said then if the wedding
[51:02] garment is the baptism of the Holy
[51:03] Spirit how are we going to be
[51:04] represented any other way
[51:06] if the first church age had to come by
[51:08] the door Christ Jesus be baptized in the
[51:10] Name of Christ Jesus Christ receive the
[51:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost to put on the
[51:13] wedding garment how we come in any other
[51:16] way
[51:17] if you come by the Methodist by the
[51:19] Baptist or the Pentecostals or any other
[51:21] denomination you will be bound and cast
[51:24] out into outer Darkness
[51:26] you've got to come by Christ Jesus the
[51:28] way the door of the truth and the life
[51:30] one day that voice is going to call
[51:33] one day that church that bride is going
[51:35] to be gone one day the church will be
[51:37] called up
[51:38] one day the plays are going to be found
[51:40] or the plagues are going to fall
[51:44] and people are going to be bound up and
[51:46] cast into out of Darkness where will you
[51:47] be found
[51:49] so in Revelation 4 1 it says the voice
[51:52] which I heard was as it were of trumpet
[51:54] talking to me
[51:56] that same voice was speaking up in
[51:58] heaven
[52:00] y'all I know how it is on Wednesday
[52:02] night as soon as it gets to eight
[52:03] o'clock everybody starts running down so
[52:04] I'm not going to keep you late
[52:10] that same voice was speaking up in
[52:11] heaven come up here and I'll show you
[52:13] what's fixing to take place
[52:15] I'll tell you what's fixing to take
[52:16] place it's the bride's gone the bride's
[52:18] been called up so now now everything
[52:21] changes the scene changes because now
[52:23] it's a seat of judgment not a seed of
[52:25] Mercy anymore not a seed of Grace but
[52:27] now he's telling John I'm gonna show you
[52:29] what's going to happen now come up here
[52:31] and I'll show you what's fixing the
[52:32] takes place take place all these Christ
[52:34] rejecting Godless Sinners I'm going to
[52:36] pour my wrath out upon them it's going
[52:38] to be a terrible thing you know when
[52:41] these things have been prophesied in the
[52:42] Bible this coming I'll send you Elijah
[52:44] the prophet before the coming of the
[52:46] great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[52:47] aren't you glad he gave us a message to
[52:50] call us out to give us a way of Escape
[52:52] so that we don't have to face those
[52:54] things I I'm so glad that God gave us a
[52:56] message to know that we're not going
[52:58] through the tribulation I don't want to
[53:00] go through the tribulation I surely if
[53:02] you knew if you understood what the
[53:04] tribulation was going to entail then you
[53:06] wouldn't want to go either
[53:08] just as certain as this book is written
[53:10] there's going to be people stand there
[53:12] and be asked for a reason what was the
[53:14] reason why you rejected it what was the
[53:16] reason why you turned it down brother
[53:18] Brown was saying it behooves us as Sons
[53:20] and Daughters of God to check up on
[53:21] ourselves every hour of the day off so
[53:24] think about that now tonight when you go
[53:26] home and you're riding in your car and I
[53:28] think sometimes you know you might get
[53:30] in a spot where you're like well I'm
[53:31] sure I'm sure I know but let's check up
[53:34] let's check up and check our life check
[53:36] up our actions check up make sure make
[53:39] sure that we're in line with what the
[53:40] word says that the bride is supposed to
[53:42] be doing in this day check up on
[53:44] ourselves every hour of the day let's
[53:47] not get to a place of arrogance and
[53:48] boastfulness but just keep humility is
[53:51] the way to go up
[53:53] come up here I showed you the church
[53:55] ages on earth now come up here and I'm
[53:57] going to show you something take place
[53:58] up here Christ had left Earth he had
[54:00] gone up into Glory the church age was
[54:02] through his Spirit was finished here he
[54:04] was calling for John to come up and
[54:06] immediately he said I was in the spirit
[54:08] you know when you hear the voice of God
[54:11] speak to you something happens
[54:13] you know brother Ryan we've heard we've
[54:15] all read all those quotes where you want
[54:16] you want to get get in the spirit get in
[54:18] this how are you going to get in the
[54:19] spirit you begin to meditate upon God's
[54:21] word think about what his promises are
[54:24] to you because when the voice of God
[54:26] speaks to you something's going to
[54:27] happen that's what that's why he got in
[54:29] the spirit because he heard the voice of
[54:30] God when you hear God speak now not the
[54:33] minister not your pastor not your mom
[54:34] and dad but when God speaks Everything
[54:37] Changes oh you think about Samuel laying
[54:39] there in his bed one night and he
[54:41] thought he thought it was the priest
[54:42] calling him but he began to realize it
[54:44] wasn't the priest it was it was God
[54:45] calling him Samuel Samuel I got
[54:47] something for you to do or if we could
[54:49] get in that mode tonight to realize that
[54:51] God's calling you because he's got a
[54:52] purpose in your life that he wants to
[54:54] see fulfilled he wants to see he wants
[54:56] to see you live for him he wants to see
[54:58] you walk for him he wants to see you do
[55:00] something for him in your life I want to
[55:03] think that tonight tonight you could go
[55:05] home a changed person that tomorrow when
[55:07] you wake up tomorrow you could live for
[55:08] God and the people that you encounter at
[55:11] your school and the people that you work
[55:12] with that they can see different person
[55:14] somebody that's living for God oh that's
[55:17] that's what God is calling calling us to
[55:19] tonight
[55:20] brother Brown would say he'd say did it
[55:22] happen to you like that it did to me and
[55:25] I've never been the same since did it
[55:27] happen to you like that I can say that
[55:29] it happened to me like that I heard the
[55:31] voice to God one day I heard the voice
[55:34] of God speak to me and it changed my
[55:36] life I was never the same since when I
[55:39] heard the voice you know many times I
[55:41] would sit in church when I was a young
[55:42] man and I'd sit there and I'd fall
[55:44] asleep and I'd I'd wish the service was
[55:47] over and I'd get so excited when when
[55:49] the preacher would close their Bible
[55:51] because that meant we could go and get
[55:53] out of there real quick but one day that
[55:55] was me that was me hearing the preacher
[55:57] but one day I heard the voice of God
[55:59] speaking and it changed everything when
[56:01] you hear the voice of God you won't be
[56:03] different you'll be different you'll be
[56:05] different all right and his sheep are
[56:07] going to hear his voice his sheep are
[56:09] going to be able to recognize that voice
[56:10] his sheep are going to be able to sit in
[56:12] the congregation and say that is the
[56:15] voice of God speaking to me oh
[56:17] oh and you can recognize it it's God
[56:20] speaking to you giving you something
[56:22] that you can overcome with
[56:24] that his sheep will hear his voice
[56:27] John chapter 10 it says to him the
[56:29] Porter openeth and the sheep hear his
[56:31] voice and he calleth his own Sheep by
[56:33] name and leadeth him out oh when God
[56:35] calls you he don't just call you but he
[56:37] calls you by name he calls your name
[56:40] right out of the Bible today if you'll
[56:42] hear his voice Harden not your hearts is
[56:44] in the provocation if you'll hear his
[56:46] voice is what Paul said if you don't
[56:48] Harden your heart but listen to him
[56:49] listen to that voice speaking to you you
[56:51] know it sounds crazy today to think that
[56:54] God can speak to a human's heart
[56:57] you go out you try that go out to people
[57:00] and tell them well God told me something
[57:01] and they'll they'll look at you like
[57:03] what
[57:04] but I believe that God can still speak
[57:06] to a human heart
[57:08] and and all my I'll say like this
[57:11] tonight that you must hear the voice of
[57:13] God you must hear the voice of God oh
[57:16] would you really realize what that voice
[57:18] of God means you're you'll read the
[57:20] opening of the first seal different
[57:21] you'll read you'll read a revelation
[57:23] four different when you hear the voice
[57:25] to God what does that voice of God
[57:26] speaking God's speaking to you that this
[57:29] this tonight is for you that this sermon
[57:32] is for you that the promise of the Holy
[57:34] Ghost is for you that the Capstone is
[57:36] for you that the seals are for you and
[57:38] it's the voice of God speaking for you
[57:39] that I've got a promise staying there in
[57:41] the Bible for you and you've got to
[57:43] accept it the voice of God is your
[57:45] invitation and when you hear the voice
[57:47] of God tell you to do something it'll
[57:49] tell you it'll take you to move it'll
[57:51] tell you it's time to get up and do
[57:52] something it'll tell you it's time to
[57:54] get up and claim it time to get up and
[57:56] claim your healing it'll tell you that
[57:58] this is the thing that you've been
[58:00] looking for this is the thing you've
[58:02] been looking for all your life when the
[58:04] voice of God speaks to you to let go
[58:06] that in your heart come unto me this is
[58:08] is that is what the voice of God will
[58:10] speak to you
[58:12] in John chapter 5 Jesus said verily
[58:15] verily I say unto you he that heareth my
[58:17] word if you hear my voice and believeth
[58:19] on him that sent me hath everlasting
[58:22] life and shall not come into
[58:23] condemnation but it's passed from Death
[58:26] unto life
[58:27] verily verily I say unto you the hours
[58:29] coming and now he is when the Dead
[58:31] the dead shall hear is the voice of the
[58:34] Son of God and they that hear shall live
[58:38] now what's he talking about in in that
[58:41] verse right before that he said if you
[58:43] hear my word and believe believeth
[58:45] continue in faith believing you've got
[58:48] eternal life and you've passed from
[58:50] Death unto life you've passed you were
[58:53] dead and now you're alive and now in the
[58:56] next verse he says when the dead hear
[58:57] that voice they that hear shall live oh
[59:01] you think about that tonight he's
[59:02] sitting here in this congregation if
[59:04] you're dead in your sins and trespasses
[59:06] that you can spring to Life by hearing
[59:09] the voice of God preach to you by
[59:12] hearing the word of God and one day if
[59:15] you die and go down in the ground that
[59:16] voice that you heard is going to cause
[59:18] you to come up from the ground and if
[59:20] you don't die if you if you tear if you
[59:22] if you continue living until one day you
[59:24] come to the fullness the full stature
[59:27] with all the bride around the world one
[59:30] day that voice that you heard is going
[59:32] to catch you up and you're gonna live
[59:35] with him forever oh you think you think
[59:37] all those things that John John Saul he
[59:39] was he was looking at you he was looking
[59:41] at what we're going through right now
[59:43] he's looking at what's going to happen
[59:45] to the bride John was a type of the
[59:48] Rapture church he was a type of you he
[59:50] was a type of you just like Enoch was a
[59:52] type of you just like all these things
[59:54] that we read about are a type of you
[59:55] immediately after the church age is over
[59:57] this layout of seeing in church age then
[1:00:00] comes the rapture
[1:00:01] the church goes up like John did
[1:00:04] into the presence of God
[1:00:06] he said John I can't talk to you down
[1:00:08] there no more
[1:00:09] because I've left down here
[1:00:11] he's gone
[1:00:13] he's left down there down here so he
[1:00:16] said
[1:00:17] I've come up higher
[1:00:19] come up here with me
[1:00:21] come up here with me because I got some
[1:00:23] things to show you
[1:00:24] oh you see the word of God ain't taking
[1:00:26] us down he's taking us up you've been
[1:00:29] going up your whole Christian Journey up
[1:00:31] up up up up and one day like John come
[1:00:34] on up here and tonight I want to invite
[1:00:36] you let's go up come up when you look in
[1:00:38] the Book of Revelation you come you're
[1:00:39] coming up come up look look through
[1:00:41] John's eyes let's look through John's
[1:00:43] eyes and see what he saw you know
[1:00:45] brother said Paul was called up to the
[1:00:47] third heaven was forbidden to tell about
[1:00:49] it he got called up and he saw all sorts
[1:00:51] of things open up to him but he couldn't
[1:00:52] come back and tell it and first in
[1:00:54] second Corinthians he said I knew a man
[1:00:56] in Christ above 14 years ago whether in
[1:00:59] the body I cannot tell or whether out of
[1:01:01] the body I can't tell God knows such in
[1:01:03] one caught up to the third heaven John
[1:01:05] was caught up and wrote all these things
[1:01:07] in Mysteries and symbols but now it's
[1:01:09] revealed God sent us a prophet to preach
[1:01:12] the seals to us so it would be revealed
[1:01:15] in the last days so we could look in the
[1:01:17] Bible and read it like a newspaper so we
[1:01:19] can look and see we we know what these
[1:01:21] things represent we oh to think what a
[1:01:23] blessing it is to be able to read them
[1:01:25] and know what the Seven Stars are and
[1:01:27] the seven churches and to read and know
[1:01:30] what the voice of God is and what the
[1:01:31] open door is it's revealed now it wasn't
[1:01:34] revealed in those days but it's revealed
[1:01:37] now brother Brown said as we go along
[1:01:40] and I'm not I really am not going to
[1:01:42] keep you long so y'all just hang on with
[1:01:43] me just y'all okay just for a few more
[1:01:45] minutes
[1:01:47] see I after I asked for permission and
[1:01:49] y'all gave it thank you
[1:01:52] John was a type of the Rapture Church
[1:01:54] he's a type he's a type of you sitting
[1:01:56] right here now
[1:01:57] to everyone that hears this word John
[1:01:59] represented him John think about think
[1:02:02] about that when you read the book of
[1:02:03] Revelation that John represented you
[1:02:06] John was a representative of the blood
[1:02:08] of Jesus Christ testimony of the word he
[1:02:10] was a witness of the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:13] Ghost with a personal fellowship with
[1:02:14] Christ now if you've got a personal
[1:02:16] fellowship with Christ sitting here
[1:02:18] tonight that John was a type of you he
[1:02:21] represented the entire church that every
[1:02:23] man woman boy or girl that ever believed
[1:02:26] in Christ accept him on the same grounds
[1:02:28] he'll be summoned someday come up hither
[1:02:30] be called up before the tribulation John
[1:02:33] had an opportunity to see like a like
[1:02:36] see all the film strip played out to see
[1:02:38] how it was all going to end out he had
[1:02:41] an opportunity to see the rehearsal you
[1:02:43] know brother Ryan said that Cecil B in
[1:02:44] the middle when he when he preached that
[1:02:46] uh
[1:02:46] what priest when he when he made that
[1:02:49] movie The Ten Commandments he invited
[1:02:51] all these ministers to come and see the
[1:02:53] movie before it was released so they had
[1:02:55] a chance to sit there and watch the
[1:02:56] movie to see how it was going to turn
[1:02:58] out before it was released to everybody
[1:03:00] just like John was had an invitation to
[1:03:03] come and see the whole film strip play
[1:03:05] out before it actually happened he saw
[1:03:09] the preview he saw it just as though he
[1:03:12] lived on Earth and saw the whole church
[1:03:14] Ages come to pass to the coming of the
[1:03:16] Lord the whole book of Revelation he saw
[1:03:19] it God showed him the church age and the
[1:03:22] coming of the Jews and the pouring out
[1:03:24] of the plagues the Rapture and he saw
[1:03:28] all these things happen just as though
[1:03:29] he lived right down through the whole
[1:03:31] thing
[1:03:31] and he saw it all happen he showed him
[1:03:34] the film that he's turning
[1:03:36] and it says the the first voice which I
[1:03:38] had heard was that was as it were a
[1:03:41] trumpet talking with me
[1:03:43] there was a voice that called him the
[1:03:45] same voice that said to John come up as
[1:03:47] the same voice that'll turn some of the
[1:03:49] church someday
[1:03:51] the same voice that someone John to come
[1:03:53] up is the same voice that someone's lit
[1:03:55] dead Lazarus out of the grave
[1:03:58] it's the same tonight and I will just
[1:04:01] call the musicians up and we'll close on

[1:04:29] repent I'll give you eternal life
[1:04:31] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:04:34] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:04:36] remission of your sins and ye shall
