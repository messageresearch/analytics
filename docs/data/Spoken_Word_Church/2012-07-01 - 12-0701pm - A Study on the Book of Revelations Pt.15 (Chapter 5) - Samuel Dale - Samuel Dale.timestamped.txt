[18:44] God in Jesus name
[18:49] amen the revelation of Jesus Christ
[18:52] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[18:55] servants things which must shortly come
[18:57] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[18:59] his Angel unto his servant John who by a
[19:03] record of the word of God and the
[19:04] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[19:07] things that he saw blessed is he that
[19:10] readeth and they that hear the words of
[19:12] this prophecy and keep those things
[19:15] which are written therein for the time
[19:17] is at hand you may be seated the Lord
[19:19] had his blessings to the reading of the
[19:22] word and we got the fans turned and I
[19:25] turned them reverse where they wouldn't
[19:27] blow down right on C ones and I know
[19:30] it's hot but the air conditioner doing
[19:32] the best we could do brother Aaron went
[19:34] through it yesterday and things there N9
[19:36] ton of units to blowing in this church
[19:40] right now there's 5 ton blowing up here
[19:42] but it just won't work when you got 100
[19:44] bodies and and outside you got 100°
[19:48] weather it just won't do no more than
[19:50] what it can do all
[19:53] right
[19:55] now we went through the fourth chapter
[19:58] and this morning was kind of a
[20:00] review and just a few comments there at
[20:04] the end to tie on together to see what
[20:08] we've been talking
[20:10] about and uh remember we took basically
[20:13] the first chapter went through and then
[20:16] we jumped over to the fourth chapter and
[20:20] we uh begin to uh take verse by verse to
[20:25] explaining things and you know trying to
[20:28] move on and I said that would be a
[20:31] foundation to understand or a
[20:35] preparing now I want you to take these
[20:39] we go ahead and get them out way keep
[20:41] these bring them back with
[20:43] you you know fold them up you have to
[20:46] you going plan on doing it put it in
[20:47] front of the seat in front of you where
[20:49] you have one when you get back cuz I
[20:51] probably might not run anymore but see
[20:55] we've been preparing for the the point
[20:58] of trying to speak on uh chapter 5 and
[21:02] we'll get to that in a little while and
[21:04] you know try to move on into the the
[21:08] understanding going see the a
[21:10] preparation in other words you're
[21:12] preparing I'll be speaking more
[21:13] Wednesday on this but when you're
[21:17] preparing for something you're making
[21:19] ready you know it's everything and and
[21:21] all you're getting ready you uh you know
[21:23] somebody's coming to your home you clean
[21:25] your house you you go through you clean
[21:28] up everything you pick up everything you
[21:30] know and and then you you get everything
[21:33] ready and you're preparing a meal uh you
[21:36] know preparing a meal is not just uh
[21:38] going in and to a lot of people
[21:40] preparing a meal
[21:42] is paperwork to send you down
[21:45] to Cracker Barrel you know that's not
[21:49] much preparing but even at that point
[21:52] still in the Cracker Barrel somebody was
[21:55] doing the preparing and getting ready
[21:58] now you'll see more of this Wednesday
[22:00] night but I'm just saying this because
[22:03] of the way the prophet said it so what
[22:06] I've been doing with chapter 4 basically
[22:08] is preparing to be able to understand
[22:12] the fith chapter of Revelation all right
[22:15] we went through the open door the
[22:17] Rapture seeing the throne round about
[22:20] the rainbow round about The Throne 24
[22:22] Elders combat
[22:24] Beast
[22:26] um and see all of
[22:29] that it shows us the reality of the word
[22:33] of
[22:34] God in The Bride of all ages and in a
[22:38] final
[22:40] climax of The Bride in the end time in
[22:43] the Rapture of the church all right
[22:46] because you know trying to take what's
[22:48] here comparing it to what we see there
[22:52] Etc and been doing it verse by verse and
[22:56] I hope you followed what I was saying on
[22:59] that line all
[23:01] right but now to not lay much of a
[23:04] background cuz we've done that this
[23:06] morning basically doing it getting ready
[23:09] but see now we're to enter the uh fifth
[23:14] chapter of the Book of
[23:17] Revelations and uh if you want to let's
[23:21] read that fifth chapter the first
[23:26] verse
[23:29] and they don't have to pull it up
[23:30] because it's fine but they jump to our 4
[23:32] I do they generally do they can bring it
[23:34] up at Revelations
[23:36] 51 and I saw in the right hand of him
[23:39] that sat on the throne a book written
[23:42] within and on the backside seal with
[23:45] Seven
[23:47] Seals All right now as you're looking
[23:49] there in your Bibles look over to uh
[23:52] Revelations
[23:56] 4:2 and notice
[23:59] I was in the spirit and behold a throne
[24:02] was set in heaven and one set on the
[24:06] throne all right but in chapter 4 it
[24:09] doesn't mention a
[24:11] book
[24:13] right right right doesn't say anything
[24:16] about a book in the hand right all right
[24:20] chapter 5 you immediately see it's the
[24:23] same Throne the same
[24:26] situation one sitting on the throne that
[24:29] we went through in the fourth
[24:30] chapter which is the the father's Throne
[24:34] Spirit or the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[24:37] the one that Jesus come to prepare and
[24:39] make a way for the The Throne all right
[24:42] and that Throne is in the heart of man
[24:44] here upon Earth by the new
[24:47] birth true all right right but now you
[24:51] find that here in chapter 5 that there
[24:55] is a book in the hand of the one sitting
[24:57] on the the
[24:58] throne now we will not get into that
[25:03] this
[25:05] afternoon because I'm just I I want to
[25:08] go real
[25:09] slow and just uh be able to understand
[25:13] you know as we go along all right now
[25:17] Revelations
[25:19] 5 one and I saw in the right hand of him
[25:22] that sit on the throne a book written
[25:25] within and on the backside sealed with
[25:27] Seven Seals now we're not going to get
[25:28] down into that part we're only going to
[25:31] get to the point that I want you to see
[25:34] of one sitting on the throne and a book
[25:37] in his
[25:38] hand all right now remember how we done
[25:41] in chapter
[25:43] 4 door opened you didn't see
[25:47] Throne door opened right all right then
[25:51] we took another sermon then we saw a
[25:53] throne right yes all right we didn't
[25:56] talk about in the second message the one
[25:59] sitting on the throne right we move that
[26:01] over to like the third message Etc
[26:03] that's why it took so long because it's
[26:06] all a
[26:08] opening of a
[26:11] scene that God is doing
[26:15] something and watch it in a minute when
[26:17] we we cover that about a scene in glory
[26:21] and just watch the the uh the doings you
[26:26] know because that's what we want to try
[26:29] to get to but you understand what I'm
[26:31] trying to say see Revelation 4 we saw
[26:33] the the door open then we saw a throne
[26:37] MH all right we covered what that was
[26:40] and what it meant then we covered one
[26:42] sitting on the throne and who that was
[26:45] and what was going on and how was the
[26:46] Father Strong see then we saw the 24
[26:49] Elders then we saw the rainbow and then
[26:52] we saw you know and and to me it's like
[26:56] a it's like a a movie as you go in
[26:59] across you know and you see a scene now
[27:02] remember that in a minute a
[27:04] scene the scene is not the whole movie
[27:09] right it's brought forth in a the word
[27:12] scene means it's got an odd meaning to
[27:15] it the word seen actually means a stage
[27:19] not a stage like this you know not a
[27:22] stage a platform no it means the word
[27:25] stage in other words something is d on
[27:27] the platform something is there for you
[27:30] to see right all right the actors are
[27:35] there so if you were watching a movie or
[27:38] a play being acted
[27:40] out you would have a curtain in front it
[27:45] opens and a scene starts right you know
[27:49] y okay a little boy and a little girl
[27:54] you know a scene starts
[27:58] this one is over here playing in the
[27:59] yard this one's over here at the other
[28:01] house playing in the yard whatever you
[28:02] know all right then that's as far as you
[28:06] can go right cuz it's not a rolling
[28:09] thing you know like a movie picture so
[28:12] what you do is you close the curtains
[28:14] right right and that was a little boy
[28:16] and a little girl at 5 years old you
[28:18] know or something and you close a
[28:20] curtain all the next scene is a little
[28:23] boy and girl at 12 years old or
[28:25] something you know m all right you you
[28:29] get the picture right that's what you
[28:31] call a scene or a
[28:34] stage all right now keep that in mind
[28:36] and keep these quotes that I give
[28:39] you see then it just keeps unfolding
[28:44] right the and then the next third scene
[28:46] would be a young boy and a young girl
[28:48] going off to
[28:51] college and they're both in college y
[28:53] all right scene four close a curtain
[28:55] hold back up scene four Girl Meets Boy
[28:58] Boy Meets Girl you know they fall in
[29:02] love this all right see that's more like
[29:06] the acts of a play right and that's
[29:09] what's happening to me that helps me to
[29:12] understand the Book of
[29:13] Revelations but I don't just read it a
[29:16] door open in heaven and there's a throne
[29:19] and one sitting on the throne and well I
[29:21] want to know what all this
[29:24] mean or you know what's the of this
[29:28] what's the importance of knowing what
[29:31] this is you
[29:33] know well to me it's a very positive
[29:38] very important thing right
[29:43] right
[29:45] now this is something that's been with
[29:48] me for a long time so go ahead and pull
[29:50] number one on quotes
[29:54] brothers and look what brother Brown
[29:56] said about revelation
[30:02] 5 look what he's talking
[30:06] about this is taken from the breach 1963
[30:10] 317e paragraph
[30:12] 238 notice he's not an animal and this
[30:17] is in Revelations 5 all of these quotes
[30:20] today will be maybe seconds but
[30:22] somewhere out talking about but it'll go
[30:25] back to Revelations 5 okay so tie
[30:28] everything back to Revelations 5 okay
[30:31] notice he's not an animal he took the
[30:33] book out of the right hand of him that s
[30:35] on the throne that's who was it the
[30:37] owner the original owner that had the B
[30:40] book of redemption in his right
[30:43] hand and no angel no Angelic being
[30:46] nothing else could take the place
[30:49] brother Bron said Elijah was there Moses
[30:52] was there all the prophets were there
[30:55] all the sages were there
[30:57] nobody was worthy to take the book we'll
[31:00] get to that as we go on over a little
[31:02] further all
[31:05] right and this bloody lamb walked out
[31:07] and took the book out of his hand what
[31:09] was it brother this is the most
[31:12] Sublime thing in the scripture
[31:17] yep an act a act that not an angel not
[31:22] nothing could do it and the lamb come
[31:25] and took it from the right hand of him
[31:27] that set upon the throne what is it now
[31:29] it belongs to the lamb amen all right
[31:33] now without getting into the lamb that
[31:37] much but I want you to
[31:40] think about these things most
[31:44] Sublime that's right I wrote down the
[31:46] word sublime means elevated or
[31:51] lofty in
[31:54] thought Su blimy you know you say that
[31:57] was Sublime in other words you're
[31:59] meaning that it's highly elevated or
[32:02] it's lofty in thought or or
[32:06] language
[32:08] um and what it's
[32:10] doing it's impressing the
[32:14] mind with a sense of grandure or
[32:17] grandure you say that grur n d EU or E
[32:22] are something
[32:23] amen aspiring inspiring all yeah
[32:28] now I didn't say this so your Prophet
[32:30] didn't say uh Luke 17:30 Revelation 107
[32:35] Malachi
[32:37] 4 was the most sublim scriptures in the
[32:39] Bible
[32:41] right I quote those because those are
[32:43] the quotes that we give most of the
[32:46] time but he said Revelations
[32:49] 5 Y is the most
[32:53] Sublime inspiring all remember when we
[32:57] we get over about the seventh seal about
[32:58] 20 years from now
[33:01] probably that they stand in all
[33:04] right that's the words your Prophet says
[33:08] right they stand in
[33:10] all but it's like see to me the Book of
[33:14] Revelations is like a in the other
[33:17] writings is more or less
[33:19] describing uh showing him in different
[33:23] things but the Book of Revelations is
[33:26] like a SC of a play right it's just
[33:31] opening all
[33:33] right and see it I I don't understand
[33:36] how we can understand it any other way
[33:38] than
[33:40] that then to follow it is that all
[33:44] right now look what he goes on to say
[33:47] here cuz this will be a continual
[33:49] reading for a
[33:51] minute that was paragraph 238 paragraph
[33:55] 239 yeah there you go God's law required
[34:00] he's the one that holds it God's law
[34:01] required a kinsman redeemer and the lamb
[34:05] come forth come out boldly I am their
[34:08] Kinsman I am their redeemer I now have
[34:11] made intercession for them and now I've
[34:13] come to claim their rights for
[34:16] them all
[34:18] right amen amen I've come to claim their
[34:22] rights and that they have a right to
[34:24] everything that lost in the fall and I
[34:26] pay the price oh brother weed Don't It
[34:29] Make You Feel religious not my good
[34:32] works which we have done but by his not

[34:37] his Mercy oh wait a minute and them
[34:40] elders and everything else begin to
[34:42] throw off their crowns and dignities
[34:44] begin to get on the
[34:46] ground
[34:49] dignitaries no one no one could do it
[34:53] and he walked right up to the right hand
[34:54] of God and took the book out out of his
[34:57] hand and claimed his right I have died
[35:01] for them I am their kinsman redeemer I
[35:04] have I am the mediator my blood was shed
[35:08] I have become man and I did this in
[35:10] order to get to church back again the
[35:12] one I saw fora before the foundation of
[35:14] the world I have purposed it I spoke
[35:17] that it would be there and nobody was
[35:19] able to take it but I went down and done
[35:22] it myself I am their Kinsmen I became
[35:26] kin Folk
[35:27] and he takes the book amen
[35:30] watch who's waiting that who's
[35:34] who's there for me tonight who is that
[35:37] one church that's waiting there what
[35:40] else could wait there for you with that
[35:43] kinsman redeemer oh my what a Sublime
[35:46] statement or
[35:47] act now he has a title need of
[35:50] redemption I believe true Redemption he
[35:53] has it in his hand mediation is done
[35:57] he has it in his hand remember it's been
[35:59] in the hand of God all the time but now
[36:02] it's in the hand of the
[36:04] lamb now watch the title de of
[36:06] redemption of all
[36:09] creation is in his hand and he's coming
[36:12] to claim it back for the human race not
[36:15] claim it back to Angels claim it back to
[36:18] the human race which it was given for to
[36:21] make Sons and Daughters of God again
[36:24] bring them back to a Garden of Eden
[36:27] everything they lost the whole creation
[36:29] the trees the animals everything else
[36:32] know that make you feel real good he
[36:35] said I thought I was
[36:37] tired and I'm not tired
[36:39] now right let me make sure where I get
[36:43] to right I thought I was tired but I'm
[36:46] not now see sometimes I think I get I'm
[36:49] getting too old to preach and I go and
[36:51] see something like that and think I
[36:54] think I'm a Young Man m it does
[36:57] something to you see where I know this
[36:59] that there's someone there waiting for
[37:01] me there's someone paid the price that I
[37:04] couldn't pay that's right he did it for
[37:06] me Charlie he did it for you he did it
[37:09] for the whole human race and now he
[37:11] comes forth to claim his Redemptive
[37:13] rights claim it for who not for himself
[37:17] for us he's one of us he's our kin folks
[37:22] oh my he's my brother he's my savior
[37:25] he's my God he's my kinsman redeemer
[37:28] he's all for what was I without him or
[37:33] what could I be without him do you see
[37:35] he's my all and he's standing there as
[37:38] our Kinsman and now he's been
[37:40] interceding for me up there up till this
[37:43] time and now he comes forth and takes a
[37:47] book of redemption to claim his rights
[37:48] to
[37:49] what he did for us amen
[37:54] now what most people do does when they
[38:02] read see that's what people when BR
[38:04] around and preached this in '
[38:07] 63 they said see there the lamb left a
[38:09] mercy
[38:12] seat no more Redemption act
[38:16] 63 that's what a lot of Doctrine
[38:20] was they asked brother brandom and he
[38:22] said where did you get
[38:24] that I never said nothing like that
[38:29] yeah you know they asked should we
[38:31] should we preach should we give all call
[38:34] he said I never said nothing like that
[38:37] that's
[38:39] right would you see it's like the Lord
[38:42] Jesus when he said what is it if John
[38:45] remains till I come a saying went out
[38:48] from the very
[38:51] disciples among the 12
[38:54] see they said John would wasn't going to
[38:58] die how be it the Bible said he didn't
[39:01] say
[39:03] that he had no reference that John was
[39:06] going to live to be 2,000 years
[39:10] old right
[39:12] right but you see it's what we
[39:15] think so when you talk of seals and
[39:17] things and and
[39:19] Redemption we think of it all being
[39:23] over I think of it as just beginning
[39:26] that's right right amen yes
[39:30] sir we've got to be able to
[39:34] see Revelations
[39:40] 5 before we can understand Revelation 6
[39:43] now Revelation 6 starts opening in the
[39:45] seals
[39:48] right but we got to understand
[39:50] Revelations
[39:52] 5 we don't understand that it won't work
[39:58] right just like it was it brother R said
[40:01] on Daniel 70 weeks he said if you don't
[40:04] understand Daniel 70 weeks that's right
[40:06] you'll miss it in the
[40:08] seals but everybody knows all about the
[40:10] seals and nothing about Daniel 70 weeks
[40:13] yeah they won't touch
[40:15] it the man said the other day we heard
[40:18] him he said that all them numbers there
[40:20] no way to get them together what he
[40:22] already said there's no way I can get
[40:24] them together that's the only problem I
[40:26] said Billy Graham said nobody can
[40:29] understand the Trinity he would have
[40:31] said I
[40:34] can't and I don't he
[40:36] her but I'd sure like to sit down with
[40:39] the brother on the Daniel 70 weeks right
[40:41] yes
[40:42] sir but it never will happen so who's
[40:47] concerned I'm not tearing down his
[40:49] bubble I'm trying to get me and you out
[40:52] of the bubble get us into reality amen
[40:56] to see what's taking
[41:00] place I gave you statements along in the
[41:03] message on the
[41:05] fourth chapter of Revelations and I said
[41:09] if I was you I'd write this
[41:11] down you remember them how many of you
[41:15] wrote them
[41:20] down let me give you one now write it
[41:25] down
[41:27] unless we can
[41:29] see how this one gets on the throne
[41:32] right that's right and of the book he
[41:34] has in his
[41:35] hand and where the lamb comes to take
[41:38] the
[41:42] book we won't understand what's going on
[41:44] that's right
[41:46] right
[41:48] yep we will not understand
[41:53] it do we know what this is then that
[41:56] we're looking
[42:02] at brother said it was the most
[42:08] Sublime the greatest thing you could
[42:10] think of the greatest scripture one time
[42:13] I I don't remember exactly but if I get
[42:14] it wrong forgive me he said this makes
[42:17] you feel like going over crawling under
[42:19] 10 crawling under concrete block with a
[42:21] 10 gallon hat on something like that BL
[42:25] in other words how little it makes
[42:29] you of how simple God does anything
[42:33] right and yet we're stumbling all over
[42:36] it trying to find it it's always
[42:39] illustrate one rock laying out in a
[42:42] football field 300 yd long what is it
[42:45] 100 yard wide or is it 50 or 60 yard
[42:48] wide 50 yard wide 100 yard long and
[42:52] you're looking for a rock and there's
[42:54] not but one and you stumble over it
[42:57] trying to find the thing that's
[42:59] something man that's the way we do with
[43:01] our stupidity of intelligence of our
[43:03] mind right is we try to figure it
[43:07] out without without simply believing
[43:10] what God
[43:12] says that's
[43:16] right think about
[43:19] it don't think about redemption's over
[43:23] right now there will be a day when will
[43:26] be over right and he'll claim his
[43:29] possession right right there'll be a
[43:32] Rapture right
[43:35] right it's not happened yet all
[43:38] right you can spiritualize all you want
[43:41] to and I do to and believe in it but you
[43:44] know you can spiritualize it all day
[43:46] long but if it don't something happen to
[43:47] this
[43:48] body my spiritual might be something
[43:51] wrong with
[43:52] it so let's look at the next quote and I
[43:55] gave this quote to you so if you will
[43:57] keep it go ahead brother on quote number
[44:00] two I gave you this one where you could
[44:02] know
[44:04] everything on number
[44:08] two
[44:10] yeah yes this is on number two see that
[44:14] was on the breach all right now watch
[44:15] what he says here on paragraph 79 and
[44:19] 80 the revelations chap 5 Jeffersonville
[44:22] you know
[44:25] 61618
[44:29] now we find out then that this first
[44:32] beginning of the chapter that we find
[44:35] the chapter is just a
[44:38] tick now I looked up everything I could
[44:40] find on TI block it was a hard one to
[44:42] deal with I'm probably not familiar with
[44:45] a word maybe some of you know T block
[44:47] but I can tell you the definition in a
[44:48] second but it's a diamond hitch we're
[44:51] more related to a diamond
[44:53] hitch uh really a relation of a to is a
[44:57] is a rope going around a piece of wood
[45:00] in the middle yeah and it's a capability
[45:02] of moving things but really a diamond
[45:06] hitch that ties the last part of the
[45:09] church age of the third chapter now a
[45:14] diamond hitch it's in other words it's
[45:17] not a
[45:19] diamond it it would just be a hitch made
[45:23] that it be so strong you can't break it
[45:26] and things M it's you're just talking
[45:28] about something that can tie two things
[45:32] together see the ti Block in the diamond
[45:34] hitch means that there's an ability to
[45:37] be able to put two things together that
[45:40] cannot be pulled
[45:42] apart we look at it on a a car or a
[45:45] truck and we we see that there's you
[45:48] know what you call a military hits gives
[45:50] you more of an idea on your car you got
[45:52] a circular thing and on the other side
[45:55] of it that's got got a clip
[45:57] over and it is supposed to be the best
[46:00] hitch of all better than the ball and
[46:03] the thing but it just simply means to be
[46:05] able to tie two things together right
[46:07] all
[46:08] right now watch what he says is tied
[46:12] together and you'll see why I went
[46:14] through chapter
[46:16] 4 before going into
[46:20] this so the fifth chapter is just a TI
[46:23] block it it's a diamond hitch
[46:26] that ties the last part of the church
[46:30] age of the third
[46:35] chapter watch the fourth chapter tells
[46:39] what John was taken up in the
[46:43] heaven and the prepare the fifth chapter
[46:46] is preparing for
[46:48] these
[46:52] huh chapter
[46:54] 3 the fourth chapter of the Book of
[46:59] Revelation is a TI
[47:02] block a diamond
[47:06] hitch to be able to understand the fifth
[47:13] chapter
[47:15] okay something Ty the two together now
[47:18] watch
[47:20] it the fourth chapter tells what
[47:23] John was taken up into heaven and the FI
[47:26] is preparing for these were you went
[47:29] through the seven Church ages and John's
[47:32] lifted up in the four
[47:35] chapter the raptures the T block the the
[47:38] thing John went through be able to tie
[47:40] together to be able to go to heaven and
[47:42] see it all
[47:44] right and the fifth
[47:47] chapter he's just set the scene for the
[47:51] opening the Seven
[47:54] Seals
[48:03] just as he did in the first
[48:08] chapter opening the way for the seven
[48:11] Church
[48:12] ages you could have never had the seven
[48:14] Church ages yet had chapter one that's
[48:17] right you would had two and three see
[48:19] would to come right and now chapter one
[48:22] the layth place to where they could
[48:24] hitch together right tie it all into a
[48:26] channel and be in the right
[48:28] place all
[48:30] right so what does he say setting a
[48:32] scene for the opening of The Seven seal
[48:34] just as he did in the first chapter of
[48:36] Revelation Opening way for the seven
[48:38] Church edges there he stands in the
[48:41] seven golden candlesticks and he's to
[48:43] look upon his Jasper and Sh Stone and
[48:45] he's preparing for these seven Church
[48:47] ages now where was he doing that back in
[48:50] chapter
[48:52] one the one standing in the midst of
[48:54] seven gold C like son of man is
[48:56] preparing to be able to understand the
[48:58] church AG amen now he's preparing to be
[49:02] able to understand the
[49:04] seals now he's preparing for the opening
[49:06] of those Seven Seals of redemption see
[49:09] that's what the fifth chapter
[49:16] is chapter one ties together from the
[49:21] church and the book of Acts Etc and all
[49:23] and brings in the church ages
[49:27] chapter 4 is a Rapture bringing you from
[49:30] the church
[49:32] ages in the
[49:35] glory to where you can understand
[49:37] chapter
[49:39] 5 okay now one of these days I'll just
[49:42] come back and show you what I'm talking
[49:43] about in simple
[49:46] language like I did this morning just
[49:48] preach a message on it all right but
[49:50] bear with me till you get there because
[49:52] if I just preach a simple message on it
[49:55] then you won't go home and study
[49:59] it and I want you to study it
[50:01] out watch what he
[50:04] said fth chapter that's read I kind of
[50:06] read it and just take it from there and
[50:09] talk on it and give the other parts of
[50:11] the
[50:13] scripture is because it's it isn't verse
[50:17] by
[50:19] verse something that's
[50:21] happening chapter 5 is not verse by
[50:24] verse something
[50:28] happening it's
[50:30] preparing for something to
[50:35] happen and if you get the
[50:39] preparation you remember all the mo food
[50:43] together for the meal all the things you
[50:45] know you have a wedding takes weeks of
[50:48] preparing getting everything said you
[50:51] know right lot of preparation right
[50:56] then you just you read you ready for it
[50:59] then and That's the Way It Is by faith
[51:01] or something El that's this the seals
[51:05] all
[51:07] right it's not a verse by verse right
[51:11] you had to cover verse by verse you have
[51:15] to because what would be a movie without
[51:18] scenes that's
[51:20] right boy and girl playing in the yard
[51:23] one in one yard one in the other one
[51:26] blue boy and girl getting married riding
[51:28] off into the
[51:29] sunset that'd be beautiful when when you
[51:33] I've read the book
[51:35] yeah what' you read I read the
[51:39] introduction and I read the last page I
[51:42] know all about the
[51:44] book who's John and
[51:48] Mary I don't know I told you I used to
[51:51] do that when I was in school I hated to
[51:54] read to some degrees what they wanted me
[51:56] to read I want to read something else
[51:59] but I would read the introduction and
[52:01] I'd read the last few pages and I'd
[52:03] write them a what was that called a book
[52:06] report book
[52:07] report I'm just glad the teacher never
[52:10] read the
[52:13] book cuz I know what I had in it
[52:16] wouldn't what was in the
[52:21] book I just wrote in there what I
[52:23] thought and then it's elas John and Mary
[52:26] goes riding off you
[52:30] know but listen
[52:34] church it's not a verse by verse I gave
[52:36] a next
[52:38] quote look at the next one which is a
[52:40] Revelation chapter 5 um this is
[52:44] paragraph
[52:46] 58 and I just give you that where you
[52:48] get what he's to saying in chapter 4 he
[52:51] went
[52:52] through taking it verse by verse okay
[52:56] chapter 5 is not verse by
[53:01] verse it's a
[53:06] scene now listen to what I'm
[53:09] saying are you ready yes to see the
[53:12] difference in a scene than a verse by
[53:14] verse they take a verse by verse and
[53:16] they make a
[53:18] movie oh now if I miss this I don't I
[53:22] never saw the whole movie what was his
[53:24] name crocodile dunde or whatever the old
[53:27] guy you know in the movie he was
[53:29] supposed to hit somebody instead of it
[53:31] he just whooped out a gun shot him they
[53:33] just put it in the
[53:35] movie it wasn't even scheduled I
[53:38] remember that years ago or
[53:41] something see because in making a movie
[53:43] the
[53:45] director he follows the script to a
[53:48] degree but he makes out his own plan
[53:53] right it wouldn't be too good of a movie
[53:55] to go watch the life of Samuel
[53:59] Dale I wouldn't even watch
[54:07] it see about halfway through you get
[54:10] some board no but man they got all this

[55:01] verse the fourth chapter is verse by
[55:06] verse you said well why you why would
[55:08] brother R say that he said it's not a
[55:11] verse by verse it's a
[55:14] scene CU to see fourth chapter takes you
[55:18] from Earth to
[55:20] glory and you got to go through the
[55:22] verses yeah all right chapter this

[55:41] up to there it was a verse by verse now
[55:43] it's a
[55:45] scene now they got to write the book to
[55:48] get a scene from it right that's right
[55:50] but you know how they do especially in
[55:52] movies today who was the
[55:55] uh Alfred Hitchcock Alfred Hitchcock

[56:02] old you used to have that thing you know
[56:04] where that you come down and you tell
[56:06] the story it never did ended worth any
[56:07] sense at all
[56:09] right I remember one of them this boy he
[56:12] had a choice that he could take the
[56:13] right door or the left door he took the
[56:15] right door he got his wife he took the
[56:17] left door he got a line right I remember
[56:19] that but it ended before he got to the
[56:21] door you know you
[56:23] know
[56:25] see movies today they don't give you
[56:28] full
[56:30] description because they found
[56:32] out and one of these days you'll find
[56:35] out why I joke a little bit okay you

[56:40] ago I I've done that to get you
[56:43] away but listen in the movies today what
[56:46] is it there's only so many so many
[56:49] minutes of the human mind if you go over
[56:52] so many minutes on one line the mind
[56:55] will start deteriorating away w't keep
[56:58] up so you watch this stuff now it's
[57:02] fast never over 5 minutes in a scene or
[57:05] 10 they're here they're here they're
[57:08] here they're there you know these old
[57:11] Soap Box operas you see what I'm talking
[57:13] about one scene two minutes see two
[57:16] people talk Scene Three these people s
[57:19] talking and you don't know what in the
[57:20] world's going
[57:23] on but see it's clicking your mind to
[57:26] keep you
[57:28] listening all
[57:30] right so as we open in the fifth
[57:35] chapter the
[57:37] scene is a
[57:41] throne and one sitting on the
[57:45] throne and the book in his
[57:52] hand a
[57:53] s
[57:56] told you chapter 4 it was a door open
[57:59] you didn't see the throne then second
[58:02] scene was thrown third scene was one on
[58:05] the throne fourth scene was 24
[58:08] Elders you hit the fifth it's going to
[58:10] be fast because it's up there for you to
[58:13] see
[58:14] it so what do you see you bypass all of
[58:17] the
[58:18] background and you see the throne one
[58:21] sitting on the throne and a book in his
[58:23] hand
[58:30] now we'll get down later to where it'll
[58:32] show
[58:33] the
[58:35] um what these taking
[58:38] place but my whole purpose is one
[58:42] thing that I gave you
[58:45] there for you to take and
[58:48] read this is
[58:50] not a verse by
[58:53] verse this is is a
[58:57] scene setting a stage for the opening of
[59:01] the seals
[59:03] amen no way the seals can break until
[59:06] you see that Throne that one sitting on
[59:08] that throne and see that book is in his
[59:11] hand there's number two thoughts that
[59:13] I'd write down you'll never know what
[59:15] the Book of Revelations is until you see
[59:17] Revelations 5 the throne the one on the
[59:20] throne the book in his
[59:22] hand right you will never know know
[59:24] what's going on in the opening of the
[59:27] seals that's why everybody says the
[59:29] seals is the is the Holy Ghost don't
[59:32] even know what they're preaching you
[59:34] know it's
[59:35] Revelation then they'll say that it's
[59:37] for the
[59:39] Antichrist the one group goes one way
[59:41] it's a revelation it's what this great
[59:43] the other goes they can't come in the
[59:45] Middle with the
[59:48] tiit and tie it together with the rest
[59:50] of the Bible right that's why they come
[59:53] up with this polygamy under the the
[59:56] doings all right now let me throw a TI
[59:59] hitch in let me throw a d block
[1:00:04] in this message could not have been
[1:00:07] understood until this age that's right
[1:00:12] right go ahead with number four same
[1:00:15] ones we had this
[1:00:19] morning how can it ever take
[1:00:21] place until the Eagles come right
[1:00:27] right that's
[1:00:29] right could not be done pull the next
[1:00:34] one until the age of the Eagles appear
[1:00:38] can't be
[1:00:39] revealed Meli 4 had to come into
[1:00:43] being Luke 17:30 Revelations
[1:00:48] 10:7 and then the Eagles has got to come
[1:00:51] right the Eagles is the only ones that
[1:00:54] can understand understand what happened
[1:00:55] in Revelations
[1:00:58] 5 they can't understand what's going
[1:01:02] on look what your Prophet says now go to
[1:01:05] number
[1:01:06] six he's giving you some quotes to get a
[1:01:09] stage set in your mind and look what he
[1:01:13] says in the breach message 1963
[1:01:16] 317 uh paragraph 29
[1:01:20] 291 now watch when he done that watch
[1:01:23] what taken
[1:01:25] place you talk about a jubilee now he in
[1:01:29] Revelations
[1:01:31] 5 you want to read back up above there
[1:01:33] get it not then you come down here and
[1:01:35] get it below it you'll see where he's at
[1:01:37] he's in Revelations 5 he may be over in
[1:01:40] talking in the breach but he's talking
[1:01:42] about Revelations 5 to watch now this is
[1:01:47] actually exactly the breaking of them
[1:01:50] seals take
[1:01:53] place
[1:01:55] in the fifth
[1:02:06] chapter now let me state it like this
[1:02:08] brother random
[1:02:11] said if you miss the opening of the
[1:02:14] seals what did he say to
[1:02:19] do go to Christ mystery of God
[1:02:23] reveal
[1:02:25] that's quote now if you want it amen he
[1:02:28] didn't say go back to the seal book
[1:02:31] again he didn't say go through through
[1:02:33] the Daniel 70 weeks or church ages or
[1:02:35] whatever he said go to Christ and M your
[1:02:37] God revealed why in there is the
[1:02:40] complete revelation of
[1:02:44] Redemption all
[1:02:46] right now don't go back to
[1:02:50] there so if you don't understand the
[1:02:53] opening to the
[1:02:56] seals uh you might want to come back to
[1:02:58] the breach and read
[1:03:04] it and reread it and reread
[1:03:08] it and start with that thought in
[1:03:12] mind Revelations
[1:03:16] 5 is exactly the opening of the
[1:03:23] seals
[1:03:24] now I know where your mind's
[1:03:28] going see my mind is in Revelations
[1:03:32] 5 the ti hitch the
[1:03:35] diamond you know
[1:03:39] holding you're looking at it like Seal
[1:03:42] white horse rider red horse
[1:03:49] rider you might want to come down out of
[1:03:51] the ceiling just a little bit and walk
[1:03:57] I'm an eagle I'm soaring the skies yeah
[1:04:00] he soord right on out the picture
[1:04:03] remember there's 40 something Eagles and
[1:04:05] there's even vulture Eagles so Crow all
[1:04:07] you want to he said will you sure in B
[1:04:10] CU this morning you trying to encourage
[1:04:11] us to be Eagles that's right true Eagles
[1:04:14] CU a true Eagle will understand that's
[1:04:17] right so now this is exactly the break
[1:04:20] them SE watch
[1:04:23] it what he
[1:04:25] says we'll get in that high hour of
[1:04:28] Silence where's High hour of
[1:04:30] Silence Revelation 8:1 the opening of
[1:04:32] the seventh seal right just after

[1:10:19] of him that sat upon the throne there
[1:10:22] was no one in heaven or on Earth Earth
[1:10:23] or beneath the Earth that was worthy to
[1:10:26] even look at the book but one of the
[1:10:28] elders said behold the line of the tribe
[1:10:30] of Judah had prevailed John looking to
[1:10:33] see a line he saw a lamb that had been
[1:10:36] slain a bloody lamb come forth and took

[1:13:40] lion and what did he find a
[1:13:43] lamb it was a bloody lamb a lamb that
[1:13:46] had been slain how long since the
[1:13:49] foundation of the world the lamb came
[1:13:52] forth walked up up to him that had the
[1:13:54] book in his right hand and received the
[1:13:57] book climbed upon on the throne and set
[1:14:05] down that's it it's all over when when
[1:14:09] the seals were
[1:14:11] revealed when's it over when the seals
[1:14:13] was revealed when the last one that was
[1:14:16] everything that he had redeemed there
[1:14:19] was
[1:14:22] nothing look the next paragraph
[1:14:31] 151 and then when the last name on that
[1:14:34] book was
[1:14:35] redeemed the lamb came forth and took
[1:14:38] the
[1:14:39] book I'm the one that did
[1:14:43] it you know that some people
[1:14:47] believe that that was brother
[1:14:51] Brown a man person personally told me
[1:14:54] that
[1:14:55] okay

[1:16:48] foot on land one upon on the water
[1:16:50] raised up and a rainbow over his head a
[1:16:52] COV
[1:16:53] but he said you'll find him in
[1:16:54] Revelations
[1:16:56] 1 Revelations 1 and Revelations 10 then
[1:17:00] is identical
[1:17:04] yep as he climbed upon your
[1:17:08] throne sit down in your
[1:17:15] life is he the author and finisher of
[1:17:17] our
[1:17:21] Salvation is he the root and
[1:17:24] Offspring bright and Morning Star the
[1:17:26] Alpha and
[1:17:28] Omega you see the all of it
[1:17:32] amen he said brother Dale what have you
[1:17:34] been preaching today you lost
[1:17:37] me okay where I L
[1:17:43] you chapter
[1:17:46] 5 is a scene in
[1:17:50] heaven in that scene in heaven you find
[1:17:52] one one sitting on the throne the book
[1:17:55] in his
[1:17:56] hand
[1:17:59] right then you find a lamb that comes
[1:18:02] forth and takes a
[1:18:04] book where does that lamb come
[1:18:10] from and sits down on the
[1:18:14] throne becomes the one on the throne
[1:18:17] right then he can break the seals just
[1:18:21] taking the book is not the the whole
[1:18:25] story The Lamb took the book but he's
[1:18:28] got to break the seals
[1:18:30] right but there's one thing for sure if
[1:18:33] nobody was worthy even to look on the
[1:18:37] book and brother R said Moses was there
[1:18:40] Elijah was there the sage the prophets
[1:18:43] were there and said nobody was
[1:18:51] Worthy
[1:18:54] if he was worthy to take the
[1:18:56] book He's Worthy to open the seals where
[1:19:00] did he come
[1:19:02] from how did he get
[1:19:07] there he's a
[1:19:10] lamb he's not an
[1:19:12] animal we read a quote in there
[1:19:16] right he's not an animal said because he
[1:19:19] took the book
[1:19:21] right
[1:19:24] the lamb couldn't take the book but he
[1:19:26] could do it with his mouth but you know
[1:19:27] what it' be yes and how could he climb
[1:19:30] up on the throne and Sh down that's
[1:19:34] right I'll end with one
[1:19:37] statement if he's not on the throne of
[1:19:39] our hearts we're still trinitarian as
[1:19:42] well as we've ever
[1:19:45] been if he's not the one prevalent
[1:19:47] person sitting on the throne in your
[1:19:49] heart are your Revelation your Doctrine
[1:19:52] your idea
[1:19:53] your throne your
[1:19:57] concept then there's no need to worry
[1:19:59] about the opening of the seal right
[1:20:01] that's
[1:20:05] right we better find where that lamb
[1:20:07] come
[1:20:12] from think on these
[1:20:15] things A Simple Plan of
[1:20:21] Redemption a
[1:20:25] seen that when the stage would
[1:20:28] open there it
[1:20:33] is there's other things you'll find in
[1:20:35] there that we'll cover going down
[1:20:36] through there what takes place but the
[1:20:38] main scene is what Throne one sitting on
[1:20:43] the throne a book in his hand and a lamb
[1:20:46] comes up and takes the
[1:20:48] book and climbs up on the throne and S
[1:20:51] down and says I'm the one that done
[1:20:55] it amen if you can't see one true and
[1:20:59] living God Amen you can't follow under
[1:21:02] the acts of the
[1:21:05] pl
[1:21:07] right if you can't see Jesus
[1:21:11] Christ as brother around said when
[1:21:13] you're what not let's see he said when
[1:21:15] you begin to see the word you see in
[1:21:16] Jesus right right
[1:21:21] right he said if you don't see
[1:21:25] Christ in every verse y go back and read
[1:21:30] it again he said you missed
[1:21:36] something and I read the Bible the first
[1:21:38] time and I know you have to and it says
[1:21:41] and so and so be got so and so and so
[1:21:43] and so beg got so and so and 14 chapters
[1:21:46] later so and so still begotten so and
[1:21:50] so amen and I wondered well what is all
[1:21:54] of this doing in the
[1:21:56] Bible then right in the middle it would
[1:21:58] just have a little catch right in the
[1:22:03] middle but it's a
[1:22:07] lineage coming down to David and from
[1:22:11] David to Jesus
[1:22:15] Christ but you see that's where people
[1:22:17] can't even follow
[1:22:19] lineages you cannot follow the lineage
[1:22:21] of Jesus Christ from David to
[1:22:26] Jesus your lineage guns from Joseph to
[1:22:29] Joseph right didn't come to Jesus read
[1:22:32] your
[1:22:33] Bible cuz he come to Mary see and Mary
[1:22:36] has no lineage
[1:22:38] connection the Bible said Joseph right
[1:22:41] right well now we know Joseph wasn't his
[1:22:47] father we know Mary was just an
[1:22:49] incubator because he didn't even call
[1:22:51] her mother MH
[1:22:54] right she was just an
[1:22:58] incubator something
[1:23:00] used brother random says uh Masterpiece
[1:23:05] that Mary wasn't even the
[1:23:08] word he said she was a carrier of the
[1:23:11] word amen that's right he said but he is
[1:23:14] the word
[1:23:16] amen and see we can't just talk about
[1:23:19] giving birth to Jesus Christ that's
[1:23:21] wonderful
[1:23:26] we got to
[1:23:27] be the word that Jesus
[1:23:30] Christ is that's right that's right
[1:23:33] there's number three I'd write down
[1:23:35] that's right and think on these
[1:23:39] things let stand get get ready for
[1:23:51] communion
[1:23:53] today I'll get enough voice to preach
[1:23:54] instead of just talk just still then we
[1:23:57] just
[1:23:58] talk won worry about
[1:24:02] it cuz if I preach too hard I I preach
[1:24:05] my heart out down in brother college is
[1:24:07] and it's just wonderful thought that one
[1:24:09] of the old days when I used to preach
[1:24:12] you know but there sometimes I don't
[1:24:15] have the voice so I just have to waake
[1:24:18] it down and don't worry about it right
[1:24:21] don't be concerned
[1:24:23] about but think about it now the
[1:24:26] communion as we come to the
[1:24:29] par to take the
[1:24:33] communion just think on these
[1:24:36] things think about Jesus Christ what's
[1:24:42] transpiring what he's doing now what
[1:24:45] he's trying to
[1:24:47] reveal himself to you and
[1:24:50] I but he's revealing himself in you and
[1:24:54] I at the same time he reveals himself to
[1:24:58] us making us then part of the
[1:25:03] mystery if brother Rand was right I
[1:25:06] believe it's cist of mystery God
[1:25:07] revealed I than you page 74 he said the
[1:25:10] bride is part of the mystery and must be
[1:25:12] revealed
[1:25:13] yes well if you stop in revealing Jesus
[1:25:16] only you know what you are a
[1:25:20] Oneness but if you can see come over
[1:25:22] into a
[1:25:24] bride you can see who we really
[1:25:26] are we're the last in morphe of
[1:25:30] God upon this
[1:25:32] Earth it may not look like it but you
[1:25:35] know if you'd have been back there and
[1:25:36] have seen him walking you wouldn't have
[1:25:38] seen a lot would
[1:25:39] you if you didn't get to see the
[1:25:41] Miracles that took place or something in
[1:25:44] his life then what would you have
[1:25:46] thought about his
[1:25:47] life what he was
[1:25:51] doing
[1:25:53] than these things
[1:25:56] F preparing the fifth chapter is
[1:25:59] preparing for the
[1:26:05] opening if you're preparing you got to
[1:26:07] have everything in place
[1:26:11] right now said made this statement many
[1:26:14] years ago and I keep making it there's a
[1:26:17] Doctrine among the people of the message
[1:26:19] that said brother Brandon was wrong in
[1:26:20] his early part of his ministry
[1:26:22] couldn't be trusted before the seals
[1:26:24] broke and then you just come after the
[1:26:26] seals break and ours is you know you got
[1:26:28] to stay after the seals to understand
[1:26:33] anything if that be
[1:26:36] so then brother brandham could not have
[1:26:38] had the foundation of preparation for
[1:26:41] the opening of The Seven Seals that's
[1:26:44] right if he wasn't
[1:26:48] right then look what you're saying amen
[1:26:52] there's no foundation for him to stand
[1:26:54] on that's right we know you say well
[1:26:57] what about all this that the only one
[1:26:59] you can say anything about is the white
[1:27:00] horse rider and just
[1:27:03] remember even though he was a
[1:27:06] prophet God had it seal to him until the
[1:27:10] seal came off that's right so he could
[1:27:13] say the white horse riders the Holy
[1:27:17] Ghost and you go check the message when
[1:27:19] he'd say it he'd said If I'm right the
[1:27:22] Holy Ghost will come and vindicate me
[1:27:24] being right and teaching the White Horse
[1:27:26] riter as a Holy Ghost and see if the
[1:27:28] Holy Ghost didn't come down
[1:27:31] vindicate check
[1:27:34] it yeah but that's vindicating that no
[1:27:37] no light had ever shined on
[1:27:40] that he wasn't responsible because light
[1:27:42] had never shined on
[1:27:45] it after it shined he saw who it was
[1:27:50] right do you see who it
[1:27:56] is do you see Jesus Christ the same
[1:27:58] yesterday today and forever
[1:28:01] or are you just like a lot of people
[1:28:04] well you know brother br will be back
[1:28:06] one of these days and he'll pick us all
[1:28:10] up I hope that's right I told you this
[1:28:14] morning I don't want to bust nobody's
[1:28:16] boat but I just don't believe it that
[1:28:19] way I believe that we got to be right
[1:28:21] right Play
[1:28:25] Amen and people asked me something one
[1:28:28] time about those things and this is what
[1:28:30] I said to him I said if brother brandham
[1:28:32] come right out here and put a tent up in
[1:28:35] front of this
[1:28:37] church I said you would not understand
[1:28:41] what he's
[1:28:43] saying I said the reason is you don't
[1:28:46] know what he's already said that's
[1:28:51] right
[1:28:55] and I'm in at then and I still stand by
[1:28:59] right out here in front of this church
[1:29:01] Lula
[1:29:02] Georgia put up a tent preach in
[1:29:07] it if we didn't know what he had already
[1:29:09] said and had a foundation laid by the
[1:29:11] word of God and had anchored in our
[1:29:12] hearts we wouldn't know what in the
[1:29:14] world he's talking
[1:29:20] about
[1:29:23] that's where people don't understand me
[1:29:24] but I don't mind saying Lula
[1:29:27] Georgia because I know if it's not
[1:29:30] revealed you and I don't have it that's
[1:29:34] right talking about it is one thing but
[1:29:36] a revelation is another that's
[1:29:40] right think on these
[1:29:45] things 1 Corinthians 11:23 foray I
[1:29:48] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:29:50] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:29:51] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:29:53] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:29:55] he spray it and said take eat this is my
[1:29:58] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:30:00] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:30:02] also he took the cup when he had s
[1:30:04] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:30:06] my blood this do year as often as you
[1:30:08] drink it in remembrance of me where as
[1:30:10] often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:30:12] this cup you do you the Lord's death
[1:30:14] till he come wherefore whosoever shall
[1:30:16] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:30:18] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:30:20] body and blood of the Lord Lord but let
[1:30:23] a man examine himself and so let him eat
[1:30:25] of that bread and drink of that cup he
[1:30:27] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:30:29] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:30:31] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:30:34] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:30:36] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:30:38] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:30:40] when we are judged we are chasen to the
[1:30:42] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:30:44] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:30:46] when you come together to eat carry one
[1:30:48] for another and if any man hunger let
[1:30:51] him eat at home that you come not
[1:30:53] together under condemnation the rest
[1:30:55] will I set in order when I come the
[1:30:57] reason Paul made that last statement
[1:30:59] they had gotten down to where that they
[1:31:01] were just getting together and
[1:31:03] eating you know and then they maybe have
[1:31:05] something related to communion or
[1:31:08] whatever and he said don't just get get
[1:31:11] e a meal yeah make it a serious
[1:31:14] thing that's why we put it right at the
[1:31:16] end of a
[1:31:18] service take communion after the word is
[1:31:21] gone
[1:31:23] are we're supposed to have our clothes
[1:31:24] on ready to go to the promised land
[1:31:26] right right and then we can take the
[1:31:28] communion so thank on these
[1:31:31] things let's just have a moment of
[1:31:33] Silent prayer praying one for another
[1:31:35] that we may all be be together in
[1:31:46] him just have your way with each one of
[1:31:48] our hearts and lives we ask it all in
[1:31:51] Jesus name name
[1:31:53] amen the Bible said he took bread and
[1:31:56] blessed
[1:31:59] it and then break
[1:32:04] it so just think about these
[1:32:06] things think about the
[1:32:09] word of how great it
[1:32:12] was to be able to walk with
[1:32:15] them that was back
[1:32:17] there when they spoke the word wouldn't
[1:32:20] it been something to be able to stand
[1:32:21] there and seen Moses just reach that Rod
[1:32:24] out and
[1:32:25] just the sea just
[1:32:28] pared you know wouldn't it been
[1:32:30] something to stand there when a man is
[1:32:32] Dead 4 days and Lazarus come
[1:32:37] for that'd be great wouldn't it but what
[1:32:40] about all of
[1:32:43] them are waiting on you and
[1:32:47] I to become the word for this age in
[1:32:51] this time amen think on these
[1:32:58] things because if it's Hebrews
[1:33:02] 13:8 then he's the same
[1:33:05] today as he ever
[1:33:20] was
[1:33:22] this will have a whole lot more meaning
[1:33:23] to it when we get over
[1:33:27] there but now it's just an
[1:33:29] act or a thing that we
[1:33:33] do
[1:33:35] but the sick's been healed by the word
[1:33:38] like
[1:33:39] this right do just think on these
[1:33:50] things we ask you to sanctify the bread
[1:33:54] and the partakers Lord that we may be
[1:33:56] one together in you Jesus
[1:34:02] name father we thank you for this wine
[1:34:05] has gone through the part of preserving
[1:34:08] it meaning it's speaking of you Lord we
[1:34:11] ask you now that you would just bless
[1:34:13] and as we eat a little piece of bread we
[1:34:16] drank this little sip of wine that
[1:34:18] tomorrow there'll be blood cells in our
[1:34:20] body created from that very fact how
[1:34:22] much more is it in the spiritual of what
[1:34:24] we're doing Lord cuz this this is not
[1:34:28] the blood of our Lord and savior but
[1:34:29] it's an example of
[1:34:31] it just have your Holy Spirit Come and
[1:34:34] Quicken these things unto us we love you
[1:34:37] and we thank you sanctify the wine and
[1:34:38] the partakers in Jesus name amen
[1:34:50] amen
[1:35:16] be a wonderful hour to be able to sit
[1:35:17] around the throne him come and wipe the
[1:35:20] tears from eyes say Well done be a great
[1:35:25] day but this is a wonderful
[1:35:28] time to be able to
[1:35:31] just see what little bit of the word
[1:35:33] that we
[1:35:34] see and I say a little bit because we
[1:35:37] may think we know a whole lot but
[1:35:40] comparing it to what God really is we
[1:35:43] only know a little
[1:35:44] bit we're just beginning to get the
[1:35:48] scales as we preached about the other
[1:35:50] night about the eagle to get them scales
[1:35:52] off of our eyes that we can
[1:35:57] see no good for us to soar into the
[1:35:59] heavens if we can't
[1:36:02] see right so let's get everything in the
[1:36:05] right order just just depend upon him
[1:36:09] and thanks but yeah but brother Dale
[1:36:11] you've preached on the seals you
[1:36:13] preached on all this yes if I come
[1:36:14] around I got 50 more years man Brother

[1:36:52] be that old
[1:36:56] well only thing I've ever asked God to
[1:36:58] do for
[1:36:59] me I've asked him in sincerity of one
[1:37:02] thing cuz I never realized I'd ever get
[1:37:05] this old I didn't you know I didn't
[1:37:07] believe I would but the only thing I
[1:37:09] asked him I said Lord let me keep my
[1:37:14] mind I mean if I can't move a muscle and
[1:37:18] I can't do anything let me keep my mind
[1:37:23] you know the word that I
[1:37:26] can talk about him and remember him and
[1:37:29] how great he

[1:38:31] John 13th chapter verse
[1:38:33] 2 supper being ended the devil having
[1:38:36] now put into the heart of Judas this
[1:38:37] carried Simon's son to betray him Jesus
[1:38:40] knowing that the father had given all
[1:38:41] things into his hands as he would come
[1:38:43] from God and went to God he rised from
[1:38:45] suffer and laid aside his garments and
[1:38:47] took a towel and GED himself after that
[1:38:50] he poured water into to a basin begin to
[1:38:52] wash the disciples feet and to WIP them
[1:38:54] with a cowel where with he was
[1:38:56] GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and
[1:38:58] Peter said unto him Lord do thou wash my
[1:39:02] feet Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:39:05] what I do thou knowest not now but Thou
[1:39:07] shalt know Hereafter Peter Sith unto him
[1:39:10] Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus
