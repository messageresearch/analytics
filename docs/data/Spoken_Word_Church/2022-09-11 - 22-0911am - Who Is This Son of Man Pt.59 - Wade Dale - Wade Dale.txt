having fires out in arizona and different places this past summer or this summer and they were walking through and and checking out the place after it burned and there was just nothing but devastation there was just ashes everywhere and you know trees standing up and uh burnt half off and all that stuff and and um this park ranger said he happened said something caught his eye and said he turned and looked and he said it looks like it was a dead bird so he looked at it again he thought well i'm i'm just gonna you know see if everything's you know make sure the bird's dead because it was just burnt to a crisp so he took a stick he flipped the bird over there were six little babies underneath her wings that had survived that fire just cause mama spread her wings and we got underneath those wings and the fires of the devil can't bother us oh we think maybe they can but i don't think they're going to bother us we've made it through the fiery trials tribulations just by a set of feathers

husband and wife cannot be truly a family unless they are one they have to be if they're not they're not a good family wife pulling one way the husband pulling another that's pretty good i'm i wasn't going to read that but it sounds pretty good i think i'll read again they have to be if they're not they're not a good family why pulling one way and the husband another that would make an awful family but in agreement with love one to the other that's a family and now that was god's masterpiece and now all the true family here portrays that true family of god now the masterpiece family has come again christ and his bride ready to come the second adam second eve ready now to return back to their home and the whole picture has been redemption from where it was bringing it back see just exactly bringing it back again amen amen bringing it back again christ in this bride right here at the earth not in heaven they're going to start here on the earth yeah ma'am brother aaron how are you

names down last night i just kept writing and kept writing and you'll see i've got them on both sides i just kept writing almost 60 people we'd fill this church up if we could get them all to come back to church that's been with us and they're not with us they've disappeared that's why i was asking about your kids names but i was just trying to to to recall everybody's name and and we ought to

go we want to go pistachio a perfect man yes but as going up this statue of perfect man we want to bind our family together because it's a church family it's your natural family but it's a family that we're trying to build as brother brown says i'm trying not to build a church i'm trying to build individuals and we'll read that this this afternoon he's trying to build individuals not we're not trying to build a big church but what would happen if all of our loved ones got filled with the holy ghost and started coming back to church hey man have your kids stand right beside of you have your daughter standing outside of you hannah different ones jacob ashley i just started naming them last night just kept writing them down all one right after the other that we had seen in this church and now they're they're not far but they're away they're they're within god's reach i'll promise you that amen so let's don't give up on them and i'll read them this afternoon so let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this evening this afternoon that you give us lord this day yet set aside to worship you lord in spirit and truth pray lord should be with us in this service you be the active participant lord you be the one that does the speaking also lord be the one who does reveal them because without you lord we are nothing father be with the ones that are sick that are not here today the ones that are watching in lord we pray they should be with them father be with the ones that are on the highways brother louise and sister christine will obviously be coming back tomorrow or today this afternoon we pray that you'll be with them father thank you for sending the the reeds with down to visit with us some lord and may they i just feel so much at home lord that that it is home and i pray lord that we're now looking for another home a home where we never have to say goodbye we'll just say until until another million years i'm gonna go visit somebody else for a while but i'll see you again father what a wonderful time we don't know that because we're in time but lord we're heading toward an eternity we've got an eternal word that was given lord through the lips of a prophet that was given to a fivefold ministry to speak to his bride to get us all together and bind us closer together not further apart to bind us together lord in you lord we pray that you just be with us now and further my life service in jesus name we pray amen john 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was the word where it was with god and the word was god and that word was made flesh as brother bob was talking about this morning melchizedek was not your brother melchizedek was created flesh out of existence flesh but it's the same god he was the word but now that word then became flesh through a womb like i was telling you last sunday once he decide once he decided god decided this was his plan that he was going to come into the end of the world through a womb and he was going to be locked in that human body until he died he couldn't move around like he could move he said oh well he can't well no he can't he decided that he was going to be human he decided that he was going to be locked in time on this earth for a period of 30 some odd years he decided that so okay i'm going to let him just have his time have his way that's the best thing for us to do not mess up god's plan and wonder why he did that well he did it for me and you he did it so he could suffer like me and you suffer so he could grow up like me and you grew up so he could look around and see the the world and the systems of the world and condemning the denominational world and different things while he was here knowing that he would do the same thing inside of me in you amen so that word was made flesh and dwelt among us that we behold his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated i'll read the rest of these i'm going to background just a few minutes for the sake of the ones that are that haven't been here in a little while so everybody boy brother michael good looking suit man good job brother michael you know again he's teaching sunday school downstairs for a little time so we appreciate the youth of this church ain't young no more but we appreciate the the ones that are younger that were way baby young are now taking over some of the jobs and even in the back back there we've got um levi and abby and different ones that are in the very back back there running the sound system and i mean and then uh the bonnet girls are running helping with the sound system and so we've got a young group of people so us old people can kind of sit back and watch them watch them grow up like terrence said was about to read kids we were talking about last night we were wondering when was the first time they came and monique said she was four and i can remember when she was four years old she had a frilly white dress it was the whitest frilliest little dress and it was just i mean it was no baby in it it was all frilly dress so we decided to go to sonny's barbecue i don't know who did but we went to sonny's barbecue and here's this little kid that's now growing up sitting right here and that dress wasn't white when we left if you thought of that there's a turkey right who thought of that but they've all grown up so same way with us we've all grown up family so now i pray that we start growing up in the statue of perfect man we start growing up in god and that's what we're going to talk about a little bit background this morning but this afternoon i want you to really pay attention because this afternoon we're going to talk about the virtues not virtue everybody with me because these are the virtues a virtuous person but then there is a then there is a the number one which is to have virtue or brother brown said strength we'll talk about that a little bit later but we got to talk about what's going to happen when we become virtuous when we become to a place i love it when when we were reading in the bible about ruth now remember in ruth's time there wasn't any internet there wasn't facebook there wasn't tick tock there wasn't and i like what sister cletus said to uh luis the other night said i don't know what you're talking about all these tick tocks and and uh facebook's and facetime and and uh what is it instagram and twitter and all that stuff you know well it's a form of getting yourself out there well well ruth didn't have that when she was growing up but the bible says thou art a virtuous woman how did they know that because she the power that was in her made it to where people could see that she wasn't running around she wasn't doing things i was looking at the word virtuous back here a few minutes ago where brother adam was talking about he said you can be virtuous in your body every day of your life and put on that's why we dress the way we do you look at the world they don't dress virtuously they dress to where every man can see every piece of flesh they have and brother brown said i don't care if you're the most virtuous woman in the world if you put your body out there for men to see and they lust after you you've committed adultery and will give an account on the day of judgment so let it then then it does have something to do with the way you dress and man it's what you portray ruth portrayed what she was a virtuous woman she wasn't she didn't stay out all night she didn't do this she didn't do it people could see see her virtue coming forth from her because they said thou art a virtuous woman and i don't think boaz would have had anything to do with her if she wasn't a virtuous woman amen and god's not gonna have anything to do with us unless we're a virtuous woman right we're talking about brides today right amen the first thessalonians force is that every one of us you should know so we got to come to a place to where we know how we're going to know apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists we'll read it a little bit for the what perfecting of the saints that's what it's for it's not for you just come and listen to a good dissertation or a good sermon today and you get all riled up or not or you fall asleep or not amen it's to get us as i was reading the quote and i was when we were praying brother brown says i'm here to break individuals not an organization don't not organize lula church but organize an organism take an organism you are an organism and put us all together where we do work together as apostles prophets pastor teachers an evangelist for the what perfecting of all of us that's right i need perfecting by the five four ministries but by the way you're part of the fivefold ministry yeah but i gotta be perfected by the fivefold ministry i can't we're not set apart somewhere right i'll promise you that never put somebody on the pedestal because satan is there to knock them off amen let's put god up there and that's the one we want to get to anyway so that every one of you should know how to possess you know i don't know one thing about criminal justice but danielle went to school and she knows about how to talk to criminals i wouldn't have that much patience but she knows how to do it why she was schooled she knows you said well we we don't need brother brian said we don't need education he never said we didn't need that knowledge right there he never said we didn't need to learn about god amen it's kind of strange and you know when i was growing up people pulled the kids out of church out of school well some of them church too pulled them out of school because brother brown says education is of the devil when all his kids graduated high school one of them went to college and i'm like what's he teaching this and then see it's the ignorance of people amen it's the ignorance of people if you lean on your education that is of the devil your education but if you lean on god's education because a pastor teacher they teach you they teach what a teacher is to teach you something right so every one of you should know how to possess his vessel not that i don't know how to possess michael's he'll know how to possess his own all right in what sanctification and honor romans 12 verse 2 says be not conformed to this world we're going to we're going to hammer on this a little more even louise was on it wednesday night that was a good job he did wednesday night we appreciate the fivefold ministry bringing different angles but he read the same scripture but be what transformed by the renewing of what your mind look you could put a period there and be done with it but it's a comma that ye may prove ruth proved who she was she proved she was a virtuous woman they didn't have a commentary written about her it was her person her persona her her past you say i don't want the world know about my past well you better have a past with god you better have a place where you put the nail down back here and then you walked and people can see that walk is different than what it was before amen what's wrong with you i want somebody well let y'all say that about me anyway what's wrong with you but i want people to say what's wrong with that guy they tell me it works they start talking about all these series and different things you know what yellowstone and all i don't know what it is but they start talking about these and they get into it bob like they're like they're it's like a soap opera they get into it like what'd you see i wonder what's wrong with mary wonder what's wrong with john do you see you got pregnant they and they start telling me they look at me and i'll go don't know what you're talking about they say you're strange i said that's okay i can be strange leave me alone i don't want to care about i don't get wrapped up i got a big enough soap opera in my own life i don't need one on television and the bride says amen but you see how satan gets us wrapped up in all that and pulls us apart from god so this so this has got to be a transforming by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good everything i'm reading is something you got to do though remember we talked about faith and works you got to show your faith by your works and man you can't just say i've got great faith and then you don't show up for church that's right here we go again you tell me you got all this stuff and don't show up for church no it's a lie the devil has given you a lie that's right but you gotta have you gotta say well that's why that for some people it's hard because they've been in that furrow for so long the furrow that i was in is that samuel dale on sunday morning there was not one thing going to stop me from going jerks and guess what we went too okay we tried to stay in the bed as long as we could and me and tanner's support with support back then we had to sleep in the same bed of course my sister didn't ever realize any of that but we were we were laying in bed and we said well just a few more minutes daddy daddy'll forget about us yeah right he'll forget about you yeah he comes in there and he takes that big old hand and he grabs the bottom of the of the sheets and he crumples up his fist and throws them across the thing here you are you know you the cold is ice so you had to get up but that was what we came up under we didn't come up under one you feel like going to name one no well cat's got diarrhea again so we can't go grief kind of bad when you get sick and you stay sick on sunday and then you go party on monday tuesday or go on vacation or something you know but just smile better praise the lord and somebody prayed for me sunday just saying that look but you're going to pray we're going to prove who we are we are going to prove who we are regardless of whether you say well i'm just going to hold it inside i'm not going to say anything no you go one day you're going to prove who you are amen you're either and so remember i told you brother brown said there's only two things that you're motivated by what faith or doubt either you've got god in your soul today or you've got satan in your soul today that's just i'm sorry that's just the way it is that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god everybody wants the perfect will of god right okay well then let's get in the word of god ii peter once said simon peter's servant apostle of jesus christ to them they have obtained this light precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied i love those words unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord there's the knowledge of god according as his divine power has given unto us what all things that pertaining to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue he's building up to somebody to somebody this is building up peter is building up to somebody a person all right we know it's jesus christ but he's then when we get the divine nature of jesus christ that puts us in that furrow that i'm talking about you get in that furrow and you stay in that furl and you listen to what god has to say whereby are giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be what partakers of that divine nature partakers of faith partakers of knowledge particulars of virtue of temperance patience guidance partakers of that it's not so far off that we can't do it amen that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature look having escaped that's the renewing of your mind your mind is all it's it's bound up it's in prison souls in prison now what were they in prison in their mind amen but they would have escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and that's what we're beginning that's the beginning of the foundation we've been talking about forever is you must know that you're justified you must know that you're sanctified and you must know that you're filled with the holy ghost not just anointing that you're filled with the holy ghost and your desire i read your quote last sunday your desire is to be a church it's not i gotta go it's a desire it's a want to if the want to is not there you won't have the person inside of you that wrote the bible so the first stage is the birth you got to make sure you're born again that's why it's really wide down at the bottom faith really wide wide foundation because you're not going to get the virtue of jesus christ if you don't have the divine nature of jesus christ all right because look you are not your own source of these virtues think about that you are not your own source well i'm just going to because brother brown says even a statue of perfect man he says some of these have a portion of these virtues that are just out in the world but not godly virtues not the fullness of godly virtues and you can't now buy the new birth though you do have a source to get it from but without the new birth you don't have a source to get it from there's just some people that are good there's just some people that are bad it's just the way it is there's a lot of good people going to be in hell because they turn jesus christ down even though they're good people i just pray there's grace for them so the baptism of the holy ghost is what seeing you have what purified your souls i thought god did the purifying that seems a little odd doesn't it how many times have i read that several times have you ever just read that and stopped for a minute see you have purified your souls unclean spirit goes out you lock it down by the baptism of the holy ghost and then your soul has got to be still you got to be purified keep going what and obeying the truth to get that thing locked in to get where there's no hole where satan can get listen if there's a crack the devil can find it if there's a crack that you can't see he'll find it get that thing sealed together and obey what the truth so you got to find the truth through the spirit under what unfeigned in other words nothing is going to keep you from being a christian nothing i read you and i will read in a few minutes where jesus said you got to forsake father mother sister brother that's why the the carnal mind that's why we got to have a renewing of our mind the carnal mind is against all that that's why you look at when jesus was on earth everything he said was contrary to common practice think about it he was just contrary to all that that's why they hated him that's why they couldn't understand him that's why they called him all those names but now peter on the day of pentecost he didn't call him that why because that person was inside of him that person was residing in him and he knew then why jesus acted odd he knew then why jesus said hey let the dead bear the dead come follow me i didn't come to bring peace i come to bring a sword oh my he was the prince of peace but he said he came to bring a division a sword mother against father sister against brother that's what he said it's the bible but by the renewing of our mind we understand what that is it does pull us away from the world i'm not going to let my mother father sister or brother keep me away from god and listen god's not going to let your mother father sister brother keep you away from god you're the only one that's going to let your children your job your mom and your daddy like i said a million times before your kids are watching you the ones on this list right here how many times the brother dale says that maybe it's because of you they're not here because they don't see god in you that'll make us quiet just start thinking though if i can just get my mind on god purified from the things of the world unto unfeigned love of the brethren i'd rather be here than be anywhere in the world with my brothers and sisters amen see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently not just i love you no fervently being born again not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and the body forever so the only way for you to get born again is to have the word of god somewhere around you you've got to hear the word of god you can't read as dad says grier's almanac you can't read uh good news for modern men max locator and all these different ones sure they may have some good ideas they may have some good ways but i'd rather read the word of god and the prophet's message amen than all these other books and listen reading the books is not bad i've got a lot of stuff from different different people spurgeon all the different ones you know smith wigglesworth wonderful but they didn't have a message behind their message everybody with me the prophet of god had a message that was vindicated by god in the bible dwight moody had a message he had a move a move of god brother brown said he put millions of people in heaven christians but not like the bride that we're talking about today we're talking about somebody that's a little bit different a little bit odd listen when that uh the armor meat packing uh story the three sisters were common they were just oh you know we're gonna dance and we're gonna catch his eye but what caught the man's eye not the frilly dress and the paint and the what caught his eyes he walked outside and he saw a woman in her place washing in that place i mean the inner place in that place washing stuff lily hush why watch and then what did he do now listen he didn't have well i saw her on facebook yesterday i saw her she's got a twitter account oh look at that no he kept watching her and kept watching her she was different she was different she was odd to the other people that were there but guess who he came after he didn't come and get those other ones he came and got that odd one that man one year later he said i'm coming back to get you because i see something a character in you that's not in those other people so how we're going to get there therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ leaving that foundation not tearing it up building on top of it all right build on top of that foundation leaving the principle of the doctrine of christ let us go on into perfection that must mean that we're not so perfect when we first get started amen your soul by the new birth is but that outside realm memory reason conscious affects your imagination if that's not if that's not what bothers you pray for me that's what bothers me my memory of things i did the consciousness that i have of things i did man that's right am i so wrong from that that's where our problem is your problem's not in your flesh oh yeah you're getting older we're looking older we're getting pain sister francis sister francine i said how you doing she said i've got these pains that i've never had before i said you're older than you ever have been before so that that's just part of the sin curse of the fall but inside of you though is a soul that's either born again or not and then you've got an outer realm called the spirit remember reason conscious effects and imagination that all that's spinning around in amen and whatever you whichever one black dog white dog whichever one you feed the most is the one who's gonna win amen that's why i said before let it out if you've got a soul that's born again let that thing start working on it on the middle realm if you don't then you need to get born again because you never will come to the knowledge of the truth unless you got the truth inside of you therefore leaving the principle of the doctrine of class let us go on into perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance as i was saying a couple of sundays ago we had about we've had 20 people be baptized and some were baptized over again there's got to come a time where you got to quit getting wet you got to put steak down that's it no more i'm going forward hey man i'll baptize you many times as you want to but there's got to come a time where this right here has got to happen we've got to leave that in other words build on it when you have a foundation of a house you don't leave it like get rid of it you leave it where it's at and then you build on top of it that's what all of us all the years brother dale's preached 40 something years we ought to have a foundation that can't be shaken it can't be stirred it can't be moved because it's the right foundation it was built on the right place at the right time listen for the right group of people spitting all over the place of the doctrine of that how'd that happen you know what it is though can we not put our confidence on that i can put my confidence on that that we have a sure foundation a firm foundation one that cannot be moved it should not ever be shaken oh it's going to be all the winds of the winds of of things are going to come upon us doctrines or whatever you want to say or or people's ideas or or uh well i think you're doing this wrong or you think you're doing this right human beings if it weren't for humans we'd have a good church thank you sister but we got to have them amen of the doctrine of baptism and have laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment and look and this we will do or will we do if god permits so god has permitted now in the end time he has given us a place an opportunity to go on with god to not just say i'm born again no i'm born again plus yes i'm this rod that we're looking at here i'm that rod but that rod's got to have some buzz on it that rod's got to put for some almonds because that's the life that's inside of that stick and that stick was dead you and i all both were dead sticks but god is what raised us up that's right praise the lord the ark is the symbol of the son of man i'll just kind of background a little bit i'll get to my point in just a minute and brother brown thank god for a prophet he knows how to say these things look anyone who knows the scripture now probably not brother donnie there was people in you know he says anyone who knows scripture well that's probably 90 of the people in that church didn't know that he was fixing to say wood speaks of humanity and gold's piece of deity but being cordial and being nice and being sweet he's including everybody anyone knows the scripture says that gold speaks of deity and wood speaks of humanity see you shall cover it overland with gold that's what we were talking about part of that ark is wood it's not pure gold it's part wood it's got wood involved in other words it's got humanity involved in it amen but it's overlaid by gold and when christ hung on the cross it was wood but it was deity hanging on the cross standing in judgment for me and you overlaid in gold because listen inside of that ark is the two tables of stone which says thou shalt not and if you do you die thou shalt not and if you do you die but there was a man called jesus christ the gold part the deity part of it now what are me and you by the new birth we are deity yes sir unveiled in human flesh and the word was made flesh well the word's gone by the way this guy ain't left with brother branham no you're the word made flesh i thought the law speaks of judgment but between the law and the congregation there was something for deity stood in its place type of christ and then down here at the bottom brother brown said deity stands in the way between judgment the judgment of god was met by deity dedicated to death was what the three wise men brought jesus when he was born brother brown said a type of deity dedicated to death gold frankincense and myrrh then we talk about aaron's rod again look everything it was was restored again so what we're looking at we're looking at a dead stick we have debt we're all dead sticks amen but once put in the shekinah glory what's in that third department not the second one not the first one in that third compartment where nobody's back there but you and god either something's gonna die or it's gonna come to life one of the two amen but you put it under the shekinah glory everything it was was restored what that old dead stick that was dead couldn't produce anything you put it in a shekinah glory guess what please come out blooms come out almonds come out and you know what's miraculous with that it was shut up in a tent and an almond if y'all read your if y'all read about almonds your almonds only bloom when it's been pollinated and it's pollinated by bees how did that thing get pollinated overnight and make almonds inside of a building god how did you get saved god amen the impossibility of you making it you're born dead a stick that's the way a sinner is when he goes under the kind of glory of the holy spirit the veil drops behind him everything he ought to have been the son of god what bloom's out that's what we're going to talk about that's why my brother least was talking about this it just it just struck my heart it that's that's the almond that's that's just a dead stick but it's got life now it's going to start producing something and you know what when he brought that stick out guess what the whole congregation identified that that stick was different yes because why it showed what it was it showed the fruit it showed everything all right same way with me and you a son of god blooms out in him again amen remember overnight it budded blossom grow to almonds fruits of the spirit love joy long suffering goodness gentleness patience that's what we need to get in the third step in the shekinah glory in other words where that little sacred light was hanging over the mercy seat you know the night you got born again of the day you got born again there was a halo of light you just didn't see it there was a halo of light and it's not right here it disappeared in here amen you carry the shekinah glory today if you're born again you carry as brother bible talk about that part of that genesis 1 26 that's that's your kind of glory that was a that was a precursor that was genesis 1 26 coming down into this time element in a halo of light yes and you were in that hollow you were part of that that's why and you may not understand this but there's no way you can get a revelation without the one that wrote it inside of you not a true revelation you say oh that's good that sounds really good yeah but what's it doing to you what's it doing for you is it changing your life is it making you better is it making you worse but that's your kind of glory that part of that genesis 1 26 that's what he led those children of israel through their journey above them right but remember that's the kind of glory went away when jesus christ stepped on earth you say no it didn't you understand what i mean it went in that man that genesis 1 26 man was in jesus when he came on earth thereby with me he was not just part of the kind of glory he was the shekinah glory he was the holy of holies walking in human flesh well there where were you you were inside of him that's why folks i'm telling you when you get the new birth that's one evidence is that you agree not just to go well yo that's good no you don't agree it becomes a part of you it becomes a part of your life it becomes a part of you what kind of vocabulary did we have before it was pretty horrible wasn't it but now that vocabulary has changed and now i love to hear the word of god i love to talk about the word of god you should love that it should be something you say hey tell me about that don't tell me about that amen amen because when i was out in the world i promise you i wasted a lot of times reading stuff i should not read amen what a beautiful picture it is today of a consecrated life beautiful picture once enters in with christ dead to the things of the world hid away with god and the veil dropped down around and all the world shut off that's what it felt like last night that's why i like to come here when there's nobody yet no yakking going on no talking total quiet except for a little background music you come in you pray like i said before me man i was talking about joe telling joe this morning i saw him well i didn't tell him this but he'll hear it now but i walked out the door this uh brother john and sister alicia was the last two give them kudos they were they were the last two that was that ready to leave so i stepped out and i looked at brother joe walking toward his van and and he turned he didn't see me but he turned and you could just see this this happy glow just just and like i said like the like the cares of the world had just been stripped away for a little while and listen i know one thing's for sure the devil was still there okay but listen there's a power there's a dunamis inside of us that pushes that thing away listen it is a powerful force yes that we don't use a lot of times i mean what were you doing last night between seven and eight i it's listen voluntary i don't count names i don't keep up with stuff like that that don't bother me that's between you and god but had you'd rather be doing that or were you worrying about are you working on a situation at your house come on somebody were you worrying about a bill or were you worrying about your kids are you worried about yourself are you worried about how to get this now one hour folks just one hour just let god bathe you for one hour one hour what a beautiful picture it is today of a consecrated life who once enters in with christ dead to the things of the world hid away with god and the veils drop down around all the world shut off then look then christianity and religion becomes a what pleasure to every believer amen everybody believe brother brown was a prophet i'm in the right place right okay just wanted to make sure i hadn't shifted shifted over somewhere today people just have enough religion to make them miserable and that's correct just enough religion to make you miserable listen you hang around this message all you want to but if you're not born again you're gonna become the most miserable person in the world because you're gonna have to hear me complain about you not coming to church today people just have enough religion to make them miserable knowing that they ought to do this they're trying to escape hell i hope he didn't get up this morning said well to escape hell i think i'll go to church today no let me go back here christianity and religion becomes a pleasure to every believer a pleasure you say well i got my pleasure and try god sometimes everybody with me i i wasn't going to do this this morning but i guess i will you love the lord amen i love being around his people i really do god knows my heart i love being around his people but listen before i was born again i was ashamed to be around him i didn't want to be around brother colley i sure didn't want to be around tom falbush because he'd be on your head every five seconds i mean you saw big brother tom was he grabbed you by the shoulder and he said boy we ain't going without you when you coming i'm like going where living in sin you know i'm like going where i knew what he was talking about but you know what i'll stick with you we ain't going without you son can you say that to these people right here we ain't going without you i'm not going without my kids [Applause] nicole roberts well whatever she is now shepard i got some of these names a little bit wrong because they're some of them are married but asa where's julie asa grace think about them all ashley jeffrey jeffrey's back there but call james i like what brother keith said when he was here remember he was here the last time we were we were we were downstairs and in a bible study talk about speaking the word for your kids listen we can't save them but we can get so much close to god till he'll honor what we said oh i don't know brother branham that ain't nothing but the truth she didn't know one thing about a seal she didn't know one thing about a vial or daniel 70 weeks she just said that ain't nothing but the truth prophet of god and the prophet said whatever you want you ask him for it and she said the salvation of my two sons well the salvation of my children lord i'm looking the prophet's gone but the word's still here god changed me so that my kids can be changed change me so that my husband and my wife can be changed you see i've already got the new bird changed me some more brother brown said you'd be so close to god until satan won't know what to do with you i am waiting and wanting that time aren't you not aren't you tired of that idiot sitting on your shoulder [Applause] yeah he's an idiot but now that we come to the new birth with faith virtue knowledge temperance we built a foundation i hope we i hope i've said enough to where we are not going to don't ask for the knowledge of god without asking for the new birth first all right now god can do a short quick work no doubt but you got to be quickened first you've got to have the divine nature of god something what to vulcanize you got to have rubber to rubber amen in other words we got to have stone to stone a rock to a rock but here we're going to start with these virtues not this afternoon but we're going to talk about these virtues not virtue these virtues which is what it's what the son of god portrayed the son of man portrayed the son of god portrayed through the son of man when he was on earth anybody with me i mixed my words there for a minute the son of god is what spirit god that's the holy ghost that you have today that was in jesus like brother bob was talking about that wasn't that he got the holy ghost he was the holy oak amen he didn't have to get anything but now he did have to grow in grace and knowledge the bible says that he grew in grace and not what the humanity part of him he was human but he was god but now listen what's the difference now i'm human but i'm god made flesh in another form called the bride not johnny depp but you see that analogy that he used that's exactly what god is he's given himself in different forms same guy look same character same characteristic of that person i don't want an actor no man he is that person and where does that person reside if he resides in you he's going to make you be happy in christianity and religion just like i read you before happy but we're heading toward that right there we're heading toward the son of man the revelation of the son of man which is god in human flesh but look he's got to start here i'm going to read you a quote in just a few minutes where brother branham talks about why were you tonight where it says build me up lord build me up so that i can bring these people individuals up the statue of a perfect man that's not a collective bringing up that's an individual bringing up something needs more temperance some needs more patience some needs more this and than the other that's why he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors one for the perfecting the same he gave us five different avenues pick one it'll do you some good yes i was taken yesterday you know we've got now we've got like three different factions in the message now they're all splitting off from each other you've got the group that that we don't need a five-fold ministry we got brother branham to play tapes you know press play and all that group up there and wherever they're from up north then you've got a group that says well we've had enough shouting we need just the word then you got another group bob knows what i'm talking about then we got another group that says we ain't had enough shouting we got to know this over here and we don't want to be any anything that's anything that's that's dead needs to be buried can we not just draw them all together can we not just draw them all together press play when you want to do never deny listening now listen i say never deny and it condemns me because i don't listen to tapes i can't my mind wanders too much i think about y'all but no my mind wanders but if i'm reading i can read that's why i was so enamored by that what bob had on we'll talk about that later but but i love to read my books dad knows everybody that knows me that you know that my books are just like his they're all scribbled up they're all marked i love to read so i press play but it's in it's in form of words you know on a page then i hope we do come to a place to where we learn a lot from god and then i hope maybe somebody will stand up one day and start shouting and speaking in tongues that'll be the happiest thing i've ever had in my life and for somebody to do that and do it under the inspiration of the holy ghost not on the inspiration of the devil because gifts and callings are without repentance but you can't put the word together and not be born again so let's just bring them all three together and who's separating this the hierarchy of the message yeah they're they're the hierarchy of the message is separating over here they're separating here and they sit separating over here this group over here has only got you know there are five more preachers and no more and they all preach all the camps and all the sorry then you got this group over here that when we ain't going to deal with them because they shout too much we're just going to stay right here and they've got their little circle of people draw the circle bigger love them all that's right if you want to shout shout please do let it out if you want to learn from the word of god learn from the word of god but somewhere there's got to be a little bit of emotion look this is not an emotion all right so now we talked about there's talk about the cross bearing the cross because i i the analogy was just wonderful when i was reading this about the jesus not carrying the whole cross he only carried the top beam because the real cross would weigh 400 pounds it's just you can't do that even that beam probably weighs 100 or more just the beam the part that you're hanging on the bean part and that's why that that the guy picked it up from jesus and carried it for him there's a big burly guy big big um brother brown taught ethiopian kind of a black guy cyrene all right so there's enemies of the cross people's not even going to get to it then there's people that get to the cross listen i want everybody to get to the cross brother said for you to go to hell you got to crawl over the cross so listen let's don't forget calvary let's don't make brother branham god let's don't make your pastor god let's don't make anybody god but god and he's the one who died so get to the cross don't ever forget that don't ever forget calvary that's the very basic of your christianity we didn't pray to william branham last night we prayed to god he's the one who died for me but i do believe he used that man to speak to me so you know what i accept that i accept that he used a man to bring me god amen amen and then here's the difference carry your cross people get to the cross they get as brother brahma said they get sometimes they get a real good case of sanctification i'm sorry god forgive me in my sins clean that unclean thing out of me and then some get the holy ghost some don't some get the holy ghost and and and it seems like they just don't want to do anything else because carrying the cross is tough i was looking online this morning there was a cruise ship and a battleship this is not cruise ship christianity everybody caters everybody everybody's happy and everybody gets along and everybody's good now it's a battleship all hands on deck we have a mission to do we got a devil to kill inside of me and you start with us shoot me lord [Applause] and then carry the cross listen wars are one used to be not so much anymore but wars are won by boots on the ground now maybe not now because they got drones and they got this but back when world war one world war ii even korea even vietnam was won by boots on the ground it was won by the soldier going into the battle and fighting for what they believed in now that's what me and you got to come to do amen carry your cross but overlay it with deity amen your deity the deity inside of you but you still got to carry the victim did not carry the whole cross but only the cross beam and there's your crossbeam number one faith carry it yes until you get it then you grab the beam of virtue knowledge temperance grab that beam and take off with it take up your cross and follow jesus take up your cross what every once in a while no every day because we're going to read it here in luke philippians says for many walk of whom i've told you often now tell you even weeping paul weeping that they are enemies of the cross of christ in other words they're never going to get there whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things colossians 2 verse 14 says blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross matthew 10 verse 37 he that loveth father mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me like i said before they're watching you it's okay to you know i love hannah josh josh is back there now i don't have hannah but they're not going to stop me from coming to church because you know what the first time you stay out because they're standing in your in your living room they're going to go aha mama you ain't got what you think you got aha daddy you ain't got what you think you got don't tell me the devil don't work in your kids come on somebody and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me see he went before yes he was the stature of a perfect man one man but now he's calling us to be that same stature so we're following after him following with what not his cross his cross done away with your sins this is talking about a live life yes he defined us his life shall lose it and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it luke 9 23 says and he said unto them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily amen daily and follow me listen if y'all don't have any trouble on monday or tuesday call me i'd like to give you some um one of my beans i wouldn't do it for the world you know i wouldn't do that first corinthians 15 it says i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord not in anything else i die daily amen daily daily something's got to die now listen to this in smyrna church everybody all right let's read we've read this romans 8 verse 17 and if children then heirs heirs of god this is brother branham talking in the smyrna church age if children then heirs heirs of god and join heirs with christ if so be that we what suffer with him not going to vacation not going to cruise ship all right that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in him that's not what it says what shall we revealed in us brother brown now that's the end of that scripture listen brother brown says unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a victory not a gift a man without character can't rain wha what is rain that means you rule over something you rule over your self-will you rule over your your earthly knowledge your earthly temperance that's why i'm talking about renewing your mind your mind says i can get mad at somebody because they're mad at me amen hello somebody i cannot give this person something because they not giving me nothing hello somebody i i don't have to be kind to this brother cause he don't like me or he don't agree with me he said something so i don't have that's the way your natural mind is thinking but renewing of your mind brother brown said put yourself in his place i heard a preacher one time it's true you see somebody's having a bad day do we want to just stomp them and hang them maybe they're going through a trial right that's why i'm going to say it all right everybody with me wake up for a minute listen to this this is going to be a moment of teaching everybody with me when you go to a restaurant bride of jesus christ donny don't look down listen to me bride of jesus christ you go to a restaurant neat that woman or man is waiting on you that's their job hey ma'am whether they do a good job or a bad job they may be having a bad day maybe you ought to slip them an extra five dollar bill i've seen something i've not seen y'all but i've seen people message people go to go to a restaurant and get a whole table full of people and walk out and never put a dime down for for a tip that's horrible that's pitiful that's right that ain't somebody ain't got some of this right here [Applause] i tip 20 whatever if you give god 10 give her 20. because she's doing or he is doing you a service whether it was good bad or indifferent because remember don't tip because of them doing a good job you tip because they're a human being and they may be going through a rough time and you know what you may be going through a rough time you know what god's going to go he's going to go you remember that this is going to be a teaching this is going to be teaching moment for you i'm not going to give you 20 i'm going to give you none you're gonna get up from that table empty you say oh no way he's not like that yes he is he's a daddy he's corrective he lets you go through things because he wants you to build character characters of victory listen thank god boy where are you at thank god he don't turn desk over anymore we've said this before he don't care he don't mind he's not gonna get mad might have before might have might have a long time ago but he used to tell about that he had such a temporary you know flip a desk over you know what the only problem with that is he beat a he somebody was doing something with a cell phone one time and his family jeffrey i don't know if it was lame is laughing so she knows so boyd gets mad at the whole family takes the cell phone out in the parking lot and beats it up with a shovel now listen y'all are going i've never done that it's never happened to me blessed brother boyd bless his heart no it's happened every one of us if you didn't do it you sure wanted to a man all right so but he's got a victory over that he don't do that anymore far as i know common more meat than he's ever been right that's a victory that's a change of character that what his mind is still sure babbling oh if you just kick that wall you know what if you if you beat a cell phone up you just gotta go buy another one you just wasted eight hundred dollars on a good one right so you look down you go why not do that you you punch a wall and you put a hole in it guess what you gotta have to either pay to have it fixed or fix it yourself right amen so renewing of our mind now we gotta get over here and do like brother brown said you know count one two three four five six seven eight nine ten or do whatever you know but get the character of jesus christ and that really will help you everybody all right with them hey man we've all come through listen we live together we know about each other don't we boy i'm brother we we know about each other and we can say that but listen it's something we've all been through i just know he's been through it because i've experienced it with him but some of you well you're a little hiding a little center you [Applause] i don't know what i cannot believe boyd did that find you all your stories i'd be going i don't know why the world they did that either but character is a victory there's victory in that you know where that victory is that is power that's power over that thing because you know what it had power over you that's right that's what we're trying to get rid of because look power apart from character there you go it's satanic make you put a hole to a wall like that make you throw your cell phone out the window right but power with character is fit to rule that's what we want we know that god's ruling over us but you know what we're supposed to rule and reign over the earth how are we going to do it being babies we can't we got to have what a raising up we've got to get come up a little bit higher and that's what i i appreciate all of us look and since he wants us to share even his throne yes we'll stop right here and since he wants us to share even his throne this is jesus christ this is this is the one that has a throne a dominion he owns the world he wants you to sit with him and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and it's set down in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that we will be revealed what in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing who are willing who are willing to pick up the cross oh lord i love the cross thank you for dying for me i really don't want to go through that you don't have to son you just pick up your cross and follow me amen we don't have to get hung on the cross we just have to pick up a cross and follow him oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation let me read this right here everybody's very familiar with this i'll read this musicians come on let's stand the son of man is christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man now who is that that's character that's that man right there that's what struck me we've read that quote many many times but now it brings home it's the part of the statue of perfect man amen it's the we're feeding on that body word that was his body that was his character he he presented his character to that body so you and i are going to do the same thing gifts of god without virtues is a stumble block to the unbeliever it's not accepted by god this has to be first this has to be first you got to get born again then we're going to go up the statue of birth man we'll talk about the virtues in a package this afternoon so god bless you let's sing a song worship for a few minutes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] can [Music] go is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] again more time [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause]
