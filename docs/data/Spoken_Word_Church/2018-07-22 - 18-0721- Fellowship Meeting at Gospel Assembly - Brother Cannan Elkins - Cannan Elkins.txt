you become a lineman manifested before us tonight dog Lord we circle they meet God this is a living word tonight Lord a solidity message and we pray that somebody would receive what they need from you tonight Lord and wish you all the glory all the honor and all the praise for it in Jesus name Amen in the book of first corinthians chapter 15 first corinthians chapter 15 first writtens chapter 15 and we'll start in verse 45 first Corinthians 15:45 and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are dirty and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly even you may be seated in the Lord at the blessings to the ring of the word I like to call your attention to verse 49 and as we have more of the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly we shall also bear the image of the head a map and I would like to speak for a few moments by the health of the Lord and that home brother Homer you know stresses amen 30 minutes that fellowship means and brother pageant believe you said it give me thirty two and a half minutes I believe so by the grace the Lord will try to share something in these next few minutes that cannot see a blessing but my total bearing the image amen to put all or beware the image there is an image that you and I are is embarrass the bride is Jesus Christ and that's the Bride of Christ we have no glory our role and we're not to bear our own image we don't come in our own name but whenever we come in this union with cry we take on his image we reflect his attributes we have to reflect him everything that he is we are to reflect that and we take hold his name we become mrs. cries hey mister brother Brandi said that my last name was Roy he said that I already brown a man my wife was Cleveland and when she married me she took all my name's she became an elephants whenever that we is the bride in Christ we've been come into a oneness and unity with the Lord and we take on the name of Christ that's why today we're not known as necessarily a Baptist or Methodist or Pentecostals but we're Christians followers of Christ we become a science a madden what is that Brian we have the barest image were to reflect him and the image that we aware the image that we carry that shows it is a reflection of our identity is what if we are identified and known as to everyone around us and one that we see them we are know by image that we marry in 1959 for the RAM preached images of Christ and he said but we must in our souls reflect his spirit image and his manner of life I do not believe that Christians consist of joining churches and creeds I believe it's a reflection of Jesus Christ in the human being for we are his members the members of his body and we bear his image the scripture says now the churches cook in chapter 3 about the indecent church a program set price this hood says the true Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her arteries her after each are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what is she is reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to end easiest work of her Lord and all his works are perfect and fine in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of God how could one battlin have a good one understanding though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for God hath spoken he said we final fall to her she's glorious within without the Bride of Christ but it's not her lorry that's not relaxed but all the bride does my cuticle it reflects everything that Christ is the wishes driver's life yeah now we look at our world today and we're truly living in a messed up world that's tough I stand anymore not a man we can tell that identified by the Scriptures we are definitely living in the land of C&H amen all the prophecies have been fulfilled before us and we look at the people in the world today how they're so confused and how the people this world today they don't know who they are they don't know where they come from and they certainly don't know where there goes in fact today people who world don't even know what fail they don't know if they're male or female nothing's so confused completely deranged it's nothing more than they don't really know since that and today they look and they call it an identity crisis they don't know what the purpose of that life is they don't know who they really are they don't know that enrolled in society they don't know what they're supposed to be doing that if thrown into an identity crisis we also know that we are living today in an age full of fear there's all kinds of fears in the nation fears in the political realm phil fears across the world with wars agree.i all this and we have fears in the local community some crime and visionary and murderers and all kinds of things to be afraid of so many things to be scared of in this late hour that we're living in the bio said in the last days that men's hearts will be failing them for fear because we're living in a fearful age and one of the main things today that people are so afraid of and I know you don't have a television but if you did it on the commercials they're cops they talking about something called identity theft you can hear on the radio you can agree about in the newspapers and magazines people be through computers and technology they can take everything you old everything I every diamond their bank accounts all your possessions they can steal it from you without ever even meeting you without ever even stepping on your property without ever breaking into any kind of physical structure they can steal everything for you electronically do identity death thank you stealing your identity and use it to open up bank accounts and credit cards for your needs and so people will spend thousands of dollars on these companies that will protect identity theft fraud protection companies make money by protecting your identity now and you know think about it how there was a time but in Queens the Bride of Christ we didn't know who we were there was a time that we didn't understand who we really were because I didn t happen to stole from us we were made victims to identity theft back in the Garden of Eden so we can go back there and well this message is no other Church no the preacher has been ever been able to tell us what happened before Genesis 1:1 but we had a prophet that contained us before Genesis 1:1 into the mind of God and we sing in the creation story after Genesis 1:1 of God and the story of creation how when God created Adam Adam was like an amateur God for the random second right and was made to be a creator and half full rein in jurisdiction over God's creation he was to completely rule this earth as an immature God because he was a son of God he was made in the image and likeness of God according Scripture and he ruled the earth and how Adam has that son of God he held in his hand the book of Redemption that was given to him by God Almighty and he had a reign of that and the animals God would read even when you always like the name I don't got to name the animals yes and he has that book of addiction now the letter Eve was borne out and conquer the mire of all the lady but comes true the original preach I'm gone it was perfect because God doesn't do anything is not hurt what happens is Satan he's not able to create all they can do for her but God has already created and so we look at this how God's original plan Adam and Eve were so designed that they would have never died they were designed to be eternal beings they're in that garden that books are bitching out of hell they had all our names in that book because they were put there before the foundation of the world they met before this world was created existence or nature or any on that book in the Matabele and Adam being an amateur God he was to speak the names of that book and then those names those people would be bought for the movie because he was to be the mother all this that was the weight God originally created without physical attraction without carnal knowledge without a snake sack we were all to be born by the spoken word just Heineman enormous where we whose names from that book we were to be born through the one of thee by the spoken word yeah but then st. it created through the love of God where he crept in through deceit and how however was not the scenic on the scripture evil looks but because of the love that Adam had for us why he will brown and death with her and brother Graham sent in the first seal how do we said he forfeited the book of life for the knowledge of Satan and lost his inheritance lost everything and no way for redemption whatever Adam chose to walk back with his wife at the death he hated that book or intention or the title deed to eternal life he handed it over to Satan and that is how st. became the god of this world and now he would be known as the priests of Xavier that Donald is he late now it was corrupted and perverted in it now we know this Satan season but Satan could not hold the book his hands could take it so the title deed went back into the hands of the original owner named oh my god aren't you glad [Applause] him and suddenly never that book came back to their each other to God Almighty it was sealed with seven seals and in Revelation chapter five chocolate looks and he sees he sits on the throne he sees that little would bring on the inside on the outside and it was sealed with seven seals and John looked and he began to weep because there was no one found word to help we know seven seals and to look upon the names in that book and Tony when they brother Adam said he would because his name was on that book and if that was no one that was found worthy to open those seven seals uh-oh pretty sure we lost every item everybody who would go back with me lost if Noah couldn't open up those seven seals oh they didn't really didn't find one of the owners came to John and he said we don't he said behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah prevailed to open the book and loose the seven seals and just see this Lion of the tribe of Judah they don't see what he's expected maybe I am him but he sees this flying as a beaten bloody lamb and it had been slain before the foundation of the world and that bloody lamp comes out to the throne and he takes that seven sealed book on the hand of him that sent upon the throne and they own down in relation chapter 10 we see are beaten bloody lamb we see my angel 1963 on Sunset Mountain 40 miles northeast of Tucson Arizona the property novels that there are arrows of constellation of seven angels that men on that mountain may be what's called a constellation and that's where we get the fishermen clouded in particular they say it was formed by the winter of that constellation of seven angels a man named Joseph told the product go back and join us and be fully opening up for the seven seals and whenever he did that brothers and sisters a man who is showing that he had paid a price to redeem us back into himself and although he is not yet - full possession of us he has redeemed us back he has brought us back to our original inheritance he has brought back to us and told us of our rights is no Hareton son and the sons and daughters of God we are it almost officially off the Royal sea though they might have little as that beam Christ there's these sisters that's why I love this miss it so much because this message it shows us who we really are it reveals to us that we never really were sinners but we always were to chargaff them who yes tell who a weird up but I didn't

will be the one to present us the Christ on that thing as the trophies of his mission they said on that day he said I want to present you but also there's a chaste virgin to Christ he said don't let me down don't let me down and God help me I don't want my Lord and Savior down right over his prophet at home o my brothers and sister cousin and let me take my freedom you can hardly wait you're a part of I'm in elegance and there's absolutely nothing I can do to change that I couldn't be anything else even if I wanted to and I'm afraid you cannot believe this message even if you wanted to go to the pretest and see them off it's for you and you cannot even believe it and we're going to do it in an hour where people have walked away to the message but they walk away from it because they were because they ruin video of us they would no doubt still been here today but it was time that they be manifested in cycle if they were to an hour would say Micah people were leaving the message in there and it didn't matter to me Amen what John Collins and all they won't believe the science thing I read every article they got one with me every contradiction they kind of say a contradiction every time they say he missed a hearing a message there I'm finishing it because let me take my eyes my eyes to be wholly going to say what you want to a man John Collins tell them if they're actually prophecy been famille it was a promise I thought they would do this they don't realize it but they're fulfilling a prophecy that program set up and they're not even they only rather fill these props because it's in this hour that just like is Tennyson Timbers footstools so they raised up but then sweet kids got profit this week against the truth of this master team representing northern ones at the end time these three things have been fulfilled he said first the world is in a started conditioned to believe that say man it's in night out or important structure here that Tennyson Timbers appearance did what you think that thirdly it's in that same hour that the son of man is to be revealed and you know believe the sign never was right even when they were in the message the whole name of it's wrong believe the sign because the message teaches us that there's always a voice that follows the sign [Applause] for the revelation of Jesus Christ these laws have been anointed by Satan to speak against this message false Christ all said no anyone's Amen they have gone in the way obtained and they ran after the error of Balaam then go and the game say Nicole rack because they're absolutely fulfilling the prophecy they already Antichrist false I'm going to find something again it's the word and then we take my freedom this reveal word is the word of God to our generation this to the not Christ for Christ is the word for the Randy psychiatrist of one word or even to this believe she was in the hall but just go sleep in one word one word and let me tell you the not one word this revealed through tomorrow is for the nitrogen for the Christ it's just word to deny the oneness of the Godhead is for the not parties so they're not water baptism in jesus name it is to the night Christ to deny the doctrine of a servant Sita it is to the novel tries to deny that God was sent off in the corn amount of God for us it is to the knowledge possessed and I'm the word and if you not aware you are the nine o'clock any man any preacher or any way McGregor has the real Holy Ghost and now this word sanctified until the Holy Ghost I spoke with tongues I shout out damps out of the place and whenever I'm in this minute I realized I had not even had a word again and I did not even know who Christ was I'm talking this message this message Jesus Taylor's life may always be enough they don't you realize their name Christ there really are the real it'll work [Applause] and this is the image that we are debater right well you are to bear the image of Christ a word that in this last hour my brothers and sisters I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ or it's the power of God unto salvation now I'm not ashamed but maybe I didn't power this message I'm not ashamed to be identified with God they call me a brand might I call myself a rainbow but when they call me a brand might shake my head and I'll say yes I am because I'm ashamed to be identified with God no matter where I am around them and they got a problem with it the making there's going somewhere else because brother sister is a dark hour and in terms of this world is overriding the light of God and sister team us to lose our own earthly identity so that we can reflect the image of Christ because the image of Christ that is our true identity one we have landed in first Corinthians chapter 15 verse 49 and as we have borne the image of the earthy weight tune into this earth through a sex act through a natural physical birth and that's a lamp we form a team into the national person we shall also bear the image of the heavenly we're also divinity image of the head 1st Corinthians 15:51 the musicians can come he said behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment and the twenty clinging of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed we shall bear the image of the heavenly we shall be cheney's let me say it's been a long time coming but brother and sister were gone the old time home and in the Old Market Scott bus saying where it is becoming in the Lord where is that rapture and let me take all the nominal churches out here Baptist every day to say I'm going to God mental not only the rapture they'd only know directories there is no rapture outside this message because this message the only thing that got sent to give up prior actions faith only the Bride of Christ on the rapture and you can be in the message the outer it's gonna give you that rapture in vain because malachi for the seventh angel was sent to us with the material address the right and i message came to bring us to a rapture thing that we shall not all die but we shall all these changes a man would you stand at night don't you love it late I went three minutes over I'm sorry for the patch if you look [Applause] I love this message in presence engineer operate seven years and Pentecostal movements amen and I could open up a sermon and close and call people pray within 30 minutes at least every single time sometimes 20 minutes and then that I'll struggle to keep an hour because it's an eternal subject it's so rich you know that's why the denominations could not handle this mess home it was too rich for their stomachs couldn't handle it couldn't digest it thank God I found a people with the body is we're just trying to come together then when I get ready to go to that great tension await their answers already here and then the rapture really began when the message went forth that was the shout the Lord began to descend when the message shouted and now brother and sister you have the Holy Ghost that's the rapture in human interaction else intentionally I
