ultimate plan of of redemption he's going to do it in your flesh your flesh and my flesh all right as we beheld him the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word brother joe would go ahead and pull uh we had announced this morning that uh yeah probably yeah go and turn them at least those three yeah you might want to do the other ones too all right i don't know if you can read this i'm going to read it for you can anybody see that sister natasha who lives in the northeastern part of donich an area where shelling sometimes happens she works at a school as a cleaner a few days ago about 15 minutes after she left work a shell landed near the school and damaged the building then she was riding in a bus these people were working while there's a war going on then she was riding in a bus on her way home from the city center of the city and suddenly without realizing what she had done she just got off the bus sometimes we would call that alzheimer's but that was god she didn't know why she got off well you will in just a minute she didn't understand why but she waited for the next bus and drove to her destination when she arrived she saw people running in panic it turned out that a shell had exploded near the bus stop where she would have been where she had to wait to transfer to the next bus she praises god who had preserved her she's a believer there in the ukraine all right next that's what you're looking at there it's just devastation next everybody say i don't know if you can see this picture or not but that's that's brother this is his house and you see what that is i don't know if you can see that or not but that's a that's a rocket about that big around can you get it a little bit yeah there you go see that that's a rocket that went into his house and it didn't go off that big rocket that big is blow that building up you see how big that thing is we got a miracle working god amen all right next this is some of the believers over in the ukraine they're just like us folks common people work have children and serve the lord amen go ahead next that's one of the buildings that's been bombed out over there in the side of all right next they just do the best they can with that little heater right in front of the children there and it probably looks like a bomb shelter next all right today you may want to bring that there you go today two bombs landed on believer's yards one right here and one right here there's two bombs and those things are the big there's not not little bitty grenades either those are big old bombs and they didn't explode it's a miracle so next there's the believers hunker down into their home and i believe they're still having church service is what one of the one of the uh reports were so all right next they're in the shelter we just need to keep praying for them folks next and that's back to the to the lady that uh i've always said you know we rush in russian russia and try to get somewhere and and i'm guilty i'm guilty i want to get somewhere real fast right everybody knows that i get it everybody knows that but you know what and i get real aggravated when i don't get there five minutes ahead of time but if something happens and you don't then you find out something a whole bus station blew up patience have some patience brother brown said have patience with god what if we if we if she had not had patience or if she'd just not got off that bus when she did and i know some how many of y'all done that you pull up somewhere and you go what am i doing here you never know you will know though when the time comes i believe when we get across the curtain of time and we get into eternity god will let us know how much more he was with us than we thought he was with us amen so let's get started we'll we'll get on to the uh to some of the placing uh this morning we were talking about the book of ephesians we'll go through that again but let's read romans 8. verse 18. for i reckon that the suffering of the present time there we go are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us so where where's the conduit where is it going to be revealed it's going to be revealed in us through us for the earnest expectation of the creature our creation waiteth for the manifestation of god in human flesh god back in human flesh like he was when he walked the shores of galilee now though he's in a many-membered body not just one body for the creation was made subject to vanity what what happened in the garden of eden there was a fall all right the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly listen the animals in the world didn't willingly fall who fell man man willingly sorry she didn't know what she was doing but adam sure did he knew what he was doing he was selling the human race out but he knew i believe he knew being a son of god he knew that god was going to have to bring it back amen because the creature itself shall all also shall be delivered all right so here we are we it's been bound now it's going to be delivered from the bondage of corruption and to the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travails in pain together until now the whole world every volcano every tornado every earthquake is all because this world is trying to get back to where it's supposed to be because it's wobbling it's a big ball that's not supposed to be wobbling everything's out of cater now like where it was not out of cater when it was in the garden of eden amen and that's what we're going back to god's going to write this thing back up and we're going to be able to live on it there won't be any groaning or travailing there won't be any sorrow or pain no agony it's going to be all glorious time for the whole we know see look i want you to see all this we went through this this today and we're going to go through it again where it talks about us and we go to your bible and look at all the times that god has talked about us and we and look at verse 22 for we know now this that's paul telling us almost 2 000 years ago he said you're gonna know for we know that the whole creation growth now if we know that it's groaning and travailing if we know that then i believe god's obligated to let us know how to get it back how to put it back and he's going to do it through human beings he's going to do it to a fivefold ministry he's going to do it through us being what being subjected to him or to be give him the prominent will and we are predestinated that we're not predestinated to justification we're not predestinated the sanctification we're not predestinated just to the baptism of the holy ghost we're predestinated to adoption and if brother brown said your adoption and your new birth is two different things that we're predestinated beyond the baptism of the holy ghost may i say beyond because it's beyond the just the baby it's the baby that's growing up to the teenager that's growing up to the to the grown man to be able to god can speak to us and that's what our problems been listen the power has been here god the word of god has never lost its power the power in god's word is laying there what's been the problem man me and you brother brown said god's waiting on you and i adoption time when god can pour in his fullness that's the direct quote we'll get to maybe a couple of weeks but he's going to pour it into us he wants to do it he's waiting on us though to come to a place that we will not wreck the car car's there gas is in it keys in the hand but you got to come to a place to where you're able to drive the car and god's going to help us to get to the place that we're going to be able to drive this vehicle where we have not been able to listen pentecost were babies they didn't know how to drive the car god was not god give him a little bit he gave him gifts never took gifts out we've got gifts of speaking in tongues and healing and all the different things we we don't use them a lot but we have them and that's our whose fault is that that's our fault it's not god's fault because i don't want you to get locked in your mind that that god that by the way you're just telling us we we we're preda and adoption is all we got no listen martin luther didn't just preach to just y'all left by faith every sermon noah didn't preach it's gonna rain for 120 years and that was his whole topic luther's either but he he got that part and that part was quickened to martin luther so that he could take it to a group of people and it could be quickened to that group of people in the time frame that they're in wesley the same way pentecost the same way then you've got brother branham coming and calling those pentecostals out to something higher something more old pentecost you're looking for something that's already passed you know what he said you're looking for this great something that's already here they were looking for a prophet they were looking for somebody to turn the turn the um i guess you say denominational world upside down but what happened they denominated and they died and when they denominated and died god's not gonna stand still he just moved right on and he had a predetermined predestinated group of people that's going to be able to take this and take it to the coming of the lord we were talking this morning about predestination we we talk about that a lot and i we've been taught here for years and years and years the correct way i believe a predestination is not that god pulled you through a tube and made you come here today made you get saved no he saw that you'd want it so he had it here for you when you got here by what by foreign knowledge those he foreign knew he did predestinate all right and i've told you before predestination is the journey that's what god saw he saw the journey of every man what a mighty god we serve where sister johnny at but a god that could see down through time he's standing in eternity see down through time and he knows what you will do when you got here ever how long it was to go what you would do and what you would do even if you didn't take this path if you took another path he knew that there's 7 billion people on the earth today i was thinking yesterday i don't know how many people have died since the beginning of time but there's probably more people dead than they are alive since the beginning of time god knew every one of them can you ever one of them he knew sharon rose would be a baby but when brother brown went across the curtain of time she was a young teenage girl that was in the mind of god that's what god saw so what about this god we think we can fool him we think we can fool the god that before the beginning of time he predestinated a journey and predestinated a group of people that he saw would take it and take it and sweep it to the coming of the lord or to stop or to stop pentecost stopped they stopped at cadence barnea brother brown said that's where you know that you come to the judgment seat katis bernie they come to ocadis barnea and what they do they turn the word down they believe those 10 lion preachers and didn't take the two preachers but guess what them two preachers didn't do they didn't quit the message come on brother they didn't quit the message no they stayed 40 years listening to that junk going on in the wilderness but you know the whole time you know what they were doing joshua was a warrior and god knew he was going to use him at the end and he was going to fight his way caleb same way they were fighters and they sat there and they what they trained they come to church every sunday they come to church they come they studied they did up for 40 years bro john 40 years they basically kept silent there was no uprising between them two there was not there was not they didn't have an insurrection and said well we're going to get no they waited why they waded to a position they waited to a time that there the promised land was moses takes joshua up on the mountain and he said joshua you're going to lead them over i can't take them i'm going to have to stay here i'm going to have to pass away but i can see the promised land i can tell you about it but you're the one that's going to take the promised land and then what a consolation that in the first book of joshua and i didn't bring it with me today but it'd maybe for next time joshua he looks and he goes to this place and moses said you're going to take over i'm leaving and then joshua immediately meets god and said joshua you saw everything moses did didn't you because he was pretty much there the whole time joshua said yeah i saw everything he did he said you're going to do the same thing he said i'm going to be with you just like i was with joshua i mean with moses wherever your feet are that's your possession whatever you say that's what's going to happen and you'll never lose a battle listen we'll never lose a battle until sin comes into the camp amen i think we kind of touched on that the other day you know brother brown said and i'll read it here in just a few minutes where brother brown said give me a church you know get everybody in order get everybody in position he said there's no telling what will happen think about what brother branham did bless his heart he would go to a place and there'd be there'd be um all kind of demons and all kind of denominations and everything whirling around in the in the room and and it didn't bother him one bit because you know what he had a position he knew where he stood god gave him a commission just like he gave moses a commission get the people to believe you and nothing will stand in your way joshua get the people to believe you and nothing's going to stand in your way well they believed him all but one guy aiken thought he could just take a little bit of extra and keep it for himself a little monetary because it wasn't just a rock it was a golden wedge had some value to it had some monetary value always money women in popularity that's what would kill us but predestination is a journey president predestination it's the journey predestinated is the promise now that's where me and you fit in so let's look at this what we were talking about this morning let's go to ephesians 1 and go through that real quick paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus that's me and you grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ now look this is in the mind of god before time blessed be the god and father my lord jesus christ who had blessed that was horrible blessed if your favorite team would have scored a touchdown it'd have been a lot more than that who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings where in heavenly places in christ started in heaven come down here according us yes what chosen us in him before what so here we go we're up before the foundation of the world in the mind of god absolutely you were a seed absolutely you were set apart god knew where you where he was going to land but he alone held the seed you didn't hold it i didn't hold it because we were on this side of the fall we're on this side of the fall we didn't we lost that opportunity adam lost the opportunity to speak and somebody come into existence oh he can move trees he could move mountains he could move he could name animals but when that fall happened it separated him from god so much to where god wasn't going to use him anymore to bring sons and daughters of god on the earth but yeah genesis 1 26 was before that thank god that was before that and he made himself a promise i'm going to have children genesis 1 26 and what let us make man in our own image created he them and bring all that stuff down together god was going to have a group of children he was going to have sons and daughters of god didn't matter what knowing what abraham what abraham was going to do knowing what adam was going to do he knew what everybody was going to do i mean my what about a god that said moses you're going to bring those people out with a mighty hand you would think those and they shouted and they praised the lord they ate manna their clothes didn't fall off their body they had water beside them all the time they had all the all the pleasures of god right there among the camp and not a one of them made it two people but god just did just like he did me and you when we were in the world of sin he was just waiting he knew the predestination of each one of us so therefore he could set up destiny for me and you and give us a promise that when we got to the end of it this is what it's going to be same way the children of israel i'm going to promise you a promised land now they could have all made it they could all mate if they had to come catus bernie and those other 10 lion preachers didn't get out of the message they saw something different from everybody else ten of them god never is and uh he i say odd god is never an odds person everybody got that you know vegas and all these people they got odds just you know 47 percent you're gonna do this and twenty percent you're gonna god never has he never hasn't even watched for that he'll take one man and destroy the world with it he'll state one man moses and destroy a nation just like the united states of america odds doesn't bother him a bit a thousand people i've always wondered how samson i know he was brother brown said he wasn't now an arnold schwarzenegger he wasn't this great big muscular guy he called him a little a little uh what was it a seven lock a mama's boy a pretty boy is what he was because he got all the girls but he had those little seven locks and he wasn't no great big because they wondered why why were you getting their strength from well it wouldn't have been very bad if it had been somebody like arnold schwarzenegger that could lift a thousand pounds it wouldn't be a mystery but somebody like you know like me or or some of y'all that's skinny and you what are you laughing for but he walks out there and he takes a jawbone of an animal and kills a thousand veteran warriors they weren't just people they picked up on the side of the road no these were philistines that probably fought since they were a little kid what god got a hold of him what are you talking about brother let god get a hold of you when you get in your position listen samson knew who he was as long brother brown said as long as he could reach back here oh come on somebody as long as he could reach back here and feel those locks he knew god was with him because remember the first thing when he woke up when delilah shaved his head he reached back and they weren't there he had lost all of his strength what he had come out from under the promise he came out from the promise of god and god let him put his eyes out but guess what he got the victory at the end but this all being in the mind of god according to his chosen us and him i'll read that because you all don't have to say us because somebody already asleep according as he has chosen us i'll do it for you in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame look what he saw this is what god saw that you would be holy and without blame we blame ourselves all day long god never blames you at all well i'm pointing up there point by here that we should be holy and without blame before him in love what because he predestinated us saul what we would do saw that if we did do something wrong i was reading yesterday brother brown said the difference in a sinner and a christian a christian has sins a sinner's just a sinner but christians has multiple sins he said but god knows as soon as you do it you're going to ask forgiveness and he will forgive you amen now he's not a dodeo granddaddy he's not going to let you get by with it a bunch of times don't start that business with me hey man child training if you keep hitting your finger if you keep hitting your fingernail with a hammer do what move your finger really simple like i said this morning i i want you to see that we cause our own trouble i had somebody tell me the other day he said um oh i talked to greg salyer about you the other day i apologize so he was at the honey store but anyway what was i going to say oh there was somebody said i was talking to somebody and said say well they've ruined my career they've run my political career they've ruined my something and i thought no there is not a man ruined this ruin that somebody else has ruined me no man has ruined me who ruined me me who ruined you you you said why if that preacher would preach something different why don't you start praying differently why don't you start praying different but you don't run you don't ruin people people ruin their self that's our problem we blame the pastor blame brother branham for this and blame this for we even blame the devil for a lot of stuff like what daddy always tell us it ain't always the devil's fault it's yours the devil made me do it who was that said that um oh what was that guy's name flit wilson yeah the devil made me do it no the devil didn't make him do a lot of that because he didn't have god is the reason he did a lot of that that's the same way with me and you even going up the statue of perfect man we're going to get to a little bit later because see at the new birth as we were talking about this morning look how wide that is god gives you some leeway when you're first born again and you're a baby he gives you a wide base to work off of but watch what happens as it goes higher what he stuff starts being shaved off it's not a box it don't just keep going like this it's honed with it you're gonna need a lot more faith but you're gonna need some brotherly kindness too where god is going to what hone you and shape you if you'll let him if you don't let him brother brown said just like he said he's a child as a child when you're born again you're a child you can misbehave but you know what you remember the uh story of the what was it brother ramsay that brother brown met but he told brother branham he said i'm not preaching no more i'm done i'm finished he went and got some beer and started drinking and six months later the prophet of god said he died he said god took his servant home so he wouldn't marry his name amen god's not gonna god's not gonna let that happen he'll let it happen a time or two but you keep misbehaving you're going off the scene if you're a child of god if you're not he's not he's not obligated to but he's obligated to his children so once you are a child of god he does have some obligation you and i have obligation to our kids even though they may be you know 50 years old donny don't look at me accordingly he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love having predestinated us what look at the journey saw what we wanted saw where we were going to be having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ what to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and his will is his word to the praise of the glory of his grace when he has made us accepted and the beloved who is the beloved jesus christ remember we talked about heirs and joint heirs all right now we got to come down here the earth to see the redemption we know that it was in heaven we know that it was the mind of god listen we didn't know anything about a mind of god how many people have you heard talk about the mind of god in the denominational world or even most a lot of message believers brother brown said let's let's go back into the back part of god's mind let's go back he was opening up what the seals were open yes when he preached across the mystery guard reveal the seals were open and when he opened the seals he opened up the mind of god there was a portal open where he could walk into the end of the mind of god and understand why god did this and why god did that so will me and you that's why the seals are so important folks people get scared of them things i'm not scared of them i'm not scared of them because you know what they're to me that's my promise that's my predestinated promise that's my inheritance and that's my inheritance here we know we're going to get an inheritance there but i want my inheritance now we which are alive and remain shall not what prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet of god shall sign then christ your rights first and we which are alive and remain shall be called up we which are alive and remain can you believe that to the praise of the glory of his grace when he hath made us accepted in the beloved all right so now we've got to get to earth redemption in whom we have redemption through his blood he had to die down here on a cross the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded i like that word abounded heaped on toward us in all wisdom and prudence now that's to me that's going up the statue of a perfect man a kid doesn't have wisdom and prudence no but an adult does well some some haven't made a known to us but look what he's doing he's not just bringing us somewhere he's given us something having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation what we were talking about dispensations the other week in the dispensation of the fullness of times this is the time when it all comes together this is the time when for the gentile church this is the time when it all comes together paul had his part arenas martin columba luther wesley pentecost but now in this end time this is the fullness of times because we can look back and see everything the seals are open books open mysteries have been revealed and what are we doing with it that's my question what are we doing with it that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one not in four or 20 different doctrines everybody gets quiet when you start talking about doctrine but i'm reading you right here that he might gather together in one amen all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance you're going to fight for every inch of this one you're going to fight for every inch because you know what it's holding time it's time that god's going to hone you off and what sharpens steel steel steel sharpened steel two-edged sword and whom we also have obtained an inheritance why what our inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that would be his word that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ and whom you also trusted after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and him also after that you believed how you gonna receive something if you don't believe you got it or it's there for you every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line right and whom also that you after you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise all right so now that's your journey on earth and look which is the earnest now we know the promise we we look at the earnest of our inheritance and what is the earnest prophet of god tells us it's a down payment you go buy a car you go buy a house now you go buy a tank of gas you know you see that on facebook the other day the guy said said praise the lord i got my loan i can get a full tank of gas now but that's a down payment but now if you if you if you keep with the paperwork yeah if you stay with the paperwork that down payment's gonna turn into you on the net come on somebody you got an earnest but inside of here lays your full redemption but what are you going to do about it if you keep the book closed it's like a puzzle it's like a puzzle you got this over here you got this part over here and remember brother brian said it's like a puzzle he said but the problem with some people is they've got the puzzle but they've got the cow up in the top of the tree eating grass when he should be down on the grass eating grass they got the right picture they got the right pieces and if you like if you've ever watched my daddy put together a puzzle if it don't fit he gets his knife out it'll fit now but it ain't supposed to go there but it'll fit but that's not the way god is he's got a picture and that picture is for me and you to what that picture before the foundation of the world that's what we got to match to hey man which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession what was the purchase of possession remember at calvary the prophet of god at calvary jesus paid the whole price he even redeemed your body at calvary when his blood dropped on the earth where was your body your body was in this earth where do you think your body come from 16 elements of the ground potash calcium and all those different minerals your body was it brother brown said god paid the price claimed your body but remember it's not been applied yet see even even even claimed israel he claimed everybody at calvary but it hasn't been applied yet because it won't be applied to the jews until what their dispensation starts after we leave out of here but we're in the dispensation now puzzle gentiles we're in that dispensation last church age last church age we're in that dispensation we're getting preached the message not just to get born again it's going further than that that's our dispensation we've got a earnest of our inheritance which is the new birth if you're sitting here today that new birth is turning that new birth is turning brother brown said it's like a button man like a button when you receive the new birth he says like a button he said it goes in you and it grows it grows it doesn't stay baby it grows so the future what and i say future it should be now we've got the earnest and we're looking and preaching now all of us are trying to get us to see the purchased possession that he's already purchased it satan is just trying to get you to believe it it's not you amen he's trying to get you to believe right now that it's not you you're not worthy of it well you know what you're not in the human state you're in but i thought we were looking back to what god had already chosen before the foundation of the world before the foundation of the world swallowed you know you we had a man walk among us that knew some stuff when brother dale walked up there in jeffersonville and they were talking about redemption being over in 1963 when the seals opened this was about 1968 or 69 when we come into message we go to jeffersonville a couple times a year and they were talking about redemption being over after the seals were preached and there was no need to you know seek salvation because redemption was already over the lamb was off the mercy seat and brother brown quotes that but it didn't happen right then we know that it happens when everybody's in that's what he tells us but brother dale told him said well y'all fighting over where it was over in 1963's and my bible says redemption was over before the foundation of the world what are you all arguing about thank god for some wisdom but that was the kind of silly stuff that you you don't have to fight it you just give them a quote say look it was done before the foundation of the world well you worried about what time it was in 1963 or whenever i know it wasn't because about 90 about 99 of y'all well about 80 of you all weren't even born in 1963 and the rest of us were doing other things that we shouldn't have been doing amen so he wasn't talking redemption wasn't over for us so we just need to all go the house none of you saved y'all lost maybe maybe sister cleveland and daddy maybe but the rest of us are just lost can you see how silly that is why the world would you even have church why struggle why struggle to do anything if everything's over with and done because i thought that's what's going to happen when everything's over and done no struggling no strife we don't we don't have to when we get in the millennium you're not going to have to struggle my it's all be over well i thought that'd have stirred you up a little bit but some of y'all don't know if it's over or not i don't know when you go to the land of nod that's where cain was amen thank you brother which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchase possession of the praise of whose glory his glory all right galatians four verse one we're still talking about this there because we do have something now i say that the heir as long as he's a child different nothing from a servant though it'd be lord of all god a possession everybody with me got a possession though he be lord of all though he's going to clean the toilets in the bathroom because you got to learn somewhere amen but he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father that's why we've been here 57 58 60 years since the prophet left the scene we haven't been listening to our tutors and governors but there is somebody going to listen to him there is going to be a star student some of y'all used to hate them people because you never was one star student nobody liked them why they were different they were different they acted different they had a different mentality they were smart they made some other left too but as under tutors and governors of the time appointed to the father let's continue on number one we talk about now teaching i want to we harp on this a lot but do we not want to know positionally where we are and then i read your quote the other day where a church is settled if they have good teaching why in the world wouldn't you want to have something settled especially in this world why because you know what teaching does teaching is prophetic teaching is prophetic it tells you all right it tells you it puts everything in place right here knowing that whatever is going to happen over here you know it already here you already know the battle is this going to go this way if you have good teaching so you don't have to worry about this over here on this side because you've already been taught it over here amen got like calculus if you've been taught calculus it's whatever grade they start and calculus now probably third grade but not when i was going to school but uh why would you be feared of taking a calculus uh course in college if you'd had calculus for the 12 years you was in school you've been taught right so don't worry about the calculus that you're going to take in college it's just a little more you may have to study a little more but teaching places a man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith oh i'm sorry everybody believe brother brown was the prophet amen we believe what he said all right we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are i want to know who i am do you want to know who you are good or bad because once you know who you are you can do something about it one way or the other good or bad deception is going to kill a lot of people satan's going to tell you you're all right everything's fine you go to church you believe so did judas judas actually preached you know we see these people falling away from the message it's really not it shouldn't surprise us judas betrayed jesus and he stood right there and cast out devils he did mighty works in the name of the lord and he betrayed jesus sitting right there with him that night and jesus even washed his feet at the supper at the last supper knowing who he was that was the son of man folks that was the son of man being displayed and that's what about me and you same thing adoption series 1960. the prophet who said you said your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing so that what we're going to talk about next uh two sundays from now is the place and we'll get to it look down at the very bottom adoption is placing a sun it's not saving a sun it's not putting the sun in the body it's not making any mares and joint hairs he got that at his birth when he got born into the body you can't take him out of the body he's got to stay in the body good or bad prodigal son was a son adoption is placing of a son all right let's continue on now look at the three stages we were talking about this morning the first stage of adoption is the birth for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god it's hard for us to see though it's hard for people to see that once you get born again that just begins your journey that just begins your life in christ because but as human beings though what do we do we get to the finish line and what do you p you see runners it's running 25 and 30 miles what's the first thing they do when you get to the finish line they don't keep on running they fall down on the ground they're exhausted that's not with god when you get to the finish line and get the new birth you've got another race to go now you can lay there if you want to and the devil will run all over you but you can get up and run the next race which is an option which is the placing which is putting you in position of god that's what god wants god's not seen that except a few times on his face of this earth that people were people were positionally placed where they're supposed to be with the full power and authority of god it happened in jesus it happened in william branham and it happened in adam to a degree three people and then seven billion people in the world now how many of us are in that position that's why we're still here but we've seen it in part several times listen let's don't wait till we need it to get it let's don't wait till we need it to get it we need to get it before we need it amen that's what we're trying to do now for as many are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry have a father the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit what that we're going to be they don't say that that we are the children of god and if a child then heirs and heirs of god join heirs with christ if beast though we suffer with him that women may be also glorified together all right read ii peter simon peter servant apostle of jesus christ to them that have what have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ and then look we go down to verse five it says besides this what beside receiving the divine nature beside being put into the family of god give all diligence to add add to your faith virtue and your virtue knowledge and all this temperament ah these are added if we would have just read that in the scripture we wouldn't have needed a prophet to tell us we needed adam sorry it was already in black and white in the bible hidden in there it took a prophet though to shine the light on it and say these are required it says add it didn't say you already got then peter said to them repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins have we done that if we hadn't you you're you're falling behind right you falling behind peter said repent and be baptized everywhere in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise what's the promise you'll receive the holy ghost isn't to you and to your children and all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call that's me and you are we good let's go to number three questions and answers he's talking about the this morning through luther and wesley let's read the red the promise is the baptism of the spirit which is promised all through the old testament do you all know what was promised to the old testament to the new birth is promised through the old testament but it never was applied until the day of pentecost there was no new birth in the old testament there's no bride in the old testament there was a bride potential bride but she went she went horn and god had to put her away now is that right israel israel was supposed to be god's first bride i know some of you got that furrowed look again that's okay you're thinking at least you're not i'm hoping to fly one day the promises of baptism of the holy spirit which is promised all to the old testament listen what did jesus christ walk out on the promises of the old testament if you can't see christ in every verse go and read it again brother didn't say that was new testament if you can't see christ in every verse what we're talking about the children of israel that is the walk of a christian circumcision by joshua this morning that was the new birth that spoke of getting rid of the old man getting rid of the foreskin so that god could be made known the promise is the baptism of the holy spirit which is promised all through the old testament and new too now i want you to understand one more time before we get go to this that in the old testament they were covered under bulls and goats right the blood of jesus christ takes away sin blood of bulls and goats only covers capo covers your sin so there's no way you can get the new birth in the old testament the new birth is the life of god inside of you like we talked about this morning the vulcanizing to getting rid of the old person moses couldn't get rid of the old guy david couldn't get rid of the old guy david didn't have the new birth he killed the guy committed adultery with his wife pretty rotten but he'll be saved see there's a difference in being saved and having a new birth amen you ought to know that already you've been taught long enough the promise behold i'll send the promise of my father upon you peter said on the day of pentecost that is the promise the promised land is to live in this land of the holy spirit that's god's promise to the church is to live in the power of the spirit it's another world it's another land you have to come out of the conditions you've been in i pray today that we pray today that we get out of the conditions that we're in you say brother wait i've been in the message for 40 years well it's kind of like the guy was talking to another man the man walked up and said brother said how long you been in how long you been a christian and that brother said oh brother said i've been in the way about 40 years that man said that's your problem brother you've been in the way y'all get it sometime tomorrow maybe you have to be careful what you say about the way you can get in the way or you can get in the way okay you have to come out of the conditions that you've been in how many people are satisfied with where they at right now why mine i just did it for illustration purposes i'm not okay then what's our problem that's why that's why there's a call in the end time for the ministry to preach or teach to people how to get out of all that stuff how to change their condition how to get a what a new birth from according to malachi 4. to come out to live in this promised land to receive the promise let's continue on number four adoption series brother ryan said look now remember god predestinated you by foreknowledge that you were coming to this what he saw for knowledge he saw you coming to this everybody understand that raise their hand see god by foreknowledge predestinated you to come to the promised land what is the promised land for the christian today just raise up your hand if you know the promise is what unto you you chill what's the baptism of the holy ghost all right let's go to genesis 17. this is where he was at this morning talking about circumcision and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised you know jesus was even circumcised on the eighth day eight why why not the seventh why not the six eighth day showing that it's in eternity when you get into the baptism of the holy ghost when you receive the new birth you step over into eternity that's why i said it we don't really realize when we get the new birth what all we get we just want an emotion we just want to shout we just want to uh uh like i said a laundry list of things well well i shouted i spoke in tongues i quit doing this you should have done that it's sanctification i'm sorry the unclean spirit goes out of sanctification it don't go after the new birth if you let it back in it probably needs to go out to the new birth but you don't need to quit you need we need to quit that stuff and i did i quit that stuff at sanctification i didn't wait till i was born again i went through those stages just like the prophet tells us justified by faith went got baptized did a lot of bad things but remember justification you still got the unclean spirit all it does is chop off your past sins it puts all that in the sea of god's forgetfulness so that he don't remember it no more and he can start cleaning you up and then the unclean spirit goes out of a man in sanctification walks in dry places seeks rest finds none comes back sees what sees you in church sees you reading message books instead of what brother brown called two-story books i don't think they make them anymore all them things will the aliens marry people and have babies and all of them what is that isis i don't know what it is some magazine that you didn't read anymore after you got born again right right that's my point that's what changed you that was sanctification that was not the new birth the reason i knew i got the new birth is is when god started putting the word together for me because satan can't put the word together he will make it one word off every time he'll try to get you to believe so far oh surely you won't die you'll be his gods knowing good and evil well she was already a god she should have said i'm already a god what i need you for is that right yes he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generation he that is born in a house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed then we go to joshua 5 verse 1. and it came to pass when the kings of the amorites all their mites that's what we got to get rid of all these eyes right jb sites highlights amorites websites and all the mother signs that's old that's all i heard that in the youth camp 10 years 20 years ago so anyway and that wasn't much for the internet now my internet now it's just there's nothing you can't find junit listen to this i just want to tell you how how connected how how much we think we're protected and and nobody knows where we are jen and i were looking at number one we were talking about going to alaska so we looked up one or two places about vacations in alaska then we were gonna buy a camper to go take to illinois where we hunted and we looked into several of those sites you can't get out my phone every time i turn my phone on there's a rv for sale or there's a new vacation in alaska it says learn more you just punch that and guess what they listening they watching i know all you computers know the algorithms and stuff what you put in what you look up online there's certain things that if you keep punching that same word or phrase you're going to get all you know we're beekeepers so we do the same thing when we first started beekeeping we never got an ad for beekeeping anything when we first started beekeeping started looking up beekeeping stuff we got ads from man lake and all the different beekeeping supply places we never contacted in our life they're watching so don't think you're gonna don't think you're gonna outsmart the only thing that's gonna outsmart this world is god the only pavilion like brother colley would talk about this morning on in psalms you get in his pavilion you don't have to worry about it you stay out here man's pavilion oh listen they know where we at so you're gonna be able to hide you can prep all you want to may i speak a second you can prep all you want to it ain't bad to put up food we got food we put up in the 60s we can't even find or shells gun shells but that's because we thought then it was going to happen that way we were going to be and we could be run down and and not be able to buy stuff but you listen three places in the bible they were getting ready to kill jesus before his time one they were going to run him off a cliff they had him at the back of a cliff and they were going to push him off the cliff the bible says he walked through the crowd second one they were going to stone him he walked through the crowd and i think the third one they were going to stone him again they hated the son of man do you think they're going to like you even his own friends listen he stood up one day and he said i can't heal nobody in this town he had to take them outside the town jesus christ god himself because of their unbelief had to take them out of the situation they were in spiritualize that a little bit would you maybe god can't do anything to you he takes you out of the city you're living in i ain't talking about physical just saying but listen it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which were on the side of jordan westward and all the kings of the canaanites but you know what happened what jesus did he just changed their eyesight see that was the son of man that was adoption what happened to elisha and gaheza same thing gaze's eyes were shut elisha said we got chariots all the way around us gaza said um i don't know if there's there's only two of us and there's ten thousand of them what did elisha say god he was looking he didn't say god open his blinded eyes he said god open his eyes so we can see these angels hanging around though every tree limb more for us than they are against us that's what we're looking for with adoption folks we will never take a body change without being adopted then we can walk through and change the eyesight of a crowd that's trying to kill you i'm just telling you folks the son of man read matthew mark luke and john that's the characteristics of the son of man that's if he's back in power now again that's the way we're going to have to act sorry what i'm trying to get you to see i'm trying to get you to get all the doubt out get all that away from what that i can't do this and i've got a night that i can't get no you can get rid of those eyes because watch when they just heard that the lord had dried up the jordan before the children of israel until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was their spirit in them anymore because of the children of israel wow look at verse two and at that time which was that this morning at that time the lord said unto joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of israel the second time i'm gonna let that sink in for a minute do you ever ask god to circumcise you again because remember it's the furtheman of the journey it was a requirement why do you think there's a holy ghost right up there holy spirit right there what it's circumcising all this right here because that dick didn't circumcise when you got the new birth that circumcised the old man that killed the old man and put god inside of you then you need a circumcision of the what to put them things in you cut out some more of me lord kill more of me kill more of me we made sharp stones and circumcised the children of israel the second time and joshua made sharp knives and circumcised the children of israel to heal the foreskin and this is cause why joshua did this all the people that came out of egypt they were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way they were in the way after they came out of egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of egypt then they had not circumcised what they had not heard the full word of god they were only 20 years old they didn't they had only heard of what happened in egypt you can hear it on a tape all you want to folk but you got to live it it's great to have all those sermons but if we don't live it they're worthless but they're not worthless because god will not return void everything he says is going to be accomplished somebody's going to take this message and move it forward move it forward we're going to move it forward amen we're going to run this race to the people that were men of war which came out of egypt were consumed what they all had to die because they obeyed not the voice of the lord unto whom the lord swear that he would not show them the land which the lord swear unto their fathers that he wouldn't cease for he would give them but he didn't give it to them because they were disobedient what we read full obedience to the word of god entitles you to the token which the lord swearing to their fathers that he would give us a land that floweth with milk and honey and their children whom he raised up in their stead children so they were getting ready to cross them joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people listen that whole time they lived 20 years old they supposed to been circumcised when they were eight days old that was a requirement moses got in trouble because he didn't come on folks moses got in trouble sephora had to circumcise one of his kids that he forgot to circumcise and she got mad at him throw the foreskin at him and say they are the bloody husband because god would have killed moses because of the what i just told you in numbers but they've been 20 years they've been in the message for 20 years and they just hadn't heard the right message yeah they didn't have any good teaching to tell them where they were and what they was going to do but they had joshua came on the scene and when he did he said we're going to have to circumcise before we go any further that's why it cuts it cuts for people to preach like bob did wednesday night it cuts but that's okay it's cutting off the what excess skin the excess thoughts and ideas that we have and came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they have bowed in their place in the camp until they were whole in other words like i said they walked different and the lord said unto joshua this day have i rolled away look of the reproach of egypt i didn't get to that this morning today they were already crossed over jordan they still had some egypt inside of them that's in big print you'll be able to read that for all you older people and it's really it's really nice i like that but today you still had some of egypt inside of you when you crossed over the jordan trash sister shepherd's dream trash was being poured out of that pyramid where was it coming from it was her trash it was the trash it was inside today though i've circumcised you did what i said to do in the land you're supposed to be in the position that we're fixing to take there's no way we can get away from it we got to go this way this day have i rolled away the reproach of egypt from all few wherefore the name of this place is called gilgal until this day and the children of israel camped in gilgal and kept the passover in the 14th day of the month even in plains jericho and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the moral after the passover unleavened cakes and parts corn and the self-same day everybody understand what happened they were eating manna and now they ceased eating manna and they started eating the old corn of the land in other words they started eating something from the land they started listening to some good sermons they got some good food now manna was okay but you know what they load that stuff we hate this stuff they say we eat it every day three days three times a day pops wouldn't be bad three times a day though with it brother john popeye's chicken anyway but you see what but now look at that we're typing all this they eat the old corn of the land what it was already growing in the promised land god's not going to put something in there he's already got it there he actually let the world plant that stuff god's going to use everything to his advantage so he had the heathens plant corn knowing that they weren't going to eat it amen there's technology now that there wasn't before so that we can eat better but it was probably invented by healing the devil said i'm gonna get them people i'm gonna give them wireless i'm gonna i'm gonna unhook them where they can go anywhere and they can get all my songs and all my evil stuff all this pornography i i i can just i can get into and and god's going that's old technology god said i've been using wireless since the foundation of the world i didn't need anything to talk to my people i just spoke to them didn't have to be connected with no wire and so god said okay i'm going to let y'all go and plant all that because i know you're not going to eat it but my bride is going to be able to put 1100 sermons in a little old thing it ain't much bigger than you watch where we used to have that whole wall honestly folks that whole wall right there that the door wasn't there well that whole wall right there had a shelf like store shelves from top to bottom am i telling a lie from top to bottom eight inch reels as many as you can pack in there and if you needed to check out four sermons you had four things about this big four of them about that thick four of them this high four now you can put 400 in your pocket don't tell me god didn't use some of those eyes but they eat the whole corner of the land they god knew we would want to listen and not have to be connected man everywhere we went can you imagine even though the reels being this big the thing to play it on was as big as a refrigerator almost right i mean it was it big as a suitcase the biggest suitcase so you got this big thing sitting in the middle of the floor you're getting a lesson here you ought to see one of these things but it's this big and it's got two eight-inch reels on it and you play it one to the other and and you're you're listening to the whole tape and then all of a sudden it goes it breaks so you have to put it back together or run the tape back around and then all of a sudden the belt inside of it gets bad so it starts going [Music] so you have to do like daddy the other one of the brothers did they stuck a pencil in the stuck a pencil in the reel and played it just like this they did everything he could do back then they just got into the promised land now we get into the promised land now and we got well it's not just press play but we press play anytime we want to amen somebody don't have to tell me to press play i can press it anytime i want to but i got to have a five-fold ministry to get out of here hey man yeah i'll do the same thing and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the moral after the passover unleavened cakes and parts corn in the self same day so now the children of israel and type of the new birth is in the promised land they've crossed jordan they're starting to eat different food am i okay with that different food something you'd never heard before what do you know what about this like like uh where's richard he's in the back okay richard come to church here and i'm not going to tell you where he came from but richard my brother-in-law that man my sweet sister that plays whatever this thing he plays over here plays the bass he starts hearing about the statue of a perfect man now richard back there he'll tell you he said i didn't know anything about that statue of perfect man now he'd been going church since white and since he was a kid in this certain message church him and aaron bowl well aaron was there too and richard said i didn't know they were required brother that was preaching on me i didn't know that was required but they'll say yeah they're required brother around a priest that's your perfect man and said we needed these things and the bible tells you that if you don't have them it says i had and if you don't have them you're blind he said i didn't know it was a requirement you know what that was good teaching is what it took richard it made him in a position where he knew he had to have the virtues to get out of here thank god it's not bad being wrong it's bad to stay wrong because if you stay wrong that comes inequity and iniquity don't make it into the kingdom all right you can have your own idea all you want to there's only one truth okay okay let's get a part of this second stage if that's all right because we moved into the second stage for i reckon that the suffering of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be what revealed enough so what we're going to talk about next time is the placing but once the placing's there you got to have a manifestation you can't just say i'm in the land i got the old corn i got the um honey and whatever it was um milk i've never seen milk flow but it says flowing with milk and honey but in other words it was a great place to be right so we got to get there to know where we're going and then we're going to be able to find when we when we get there find out what we where there's where's it at right i know where honey is in a honey hive then a beehive but if you don't know where the beehive is it'll do you no good watch for the earnest expectation here we are of the creation or the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god now how is that going to be it's going to be in human flesh it's not going to be a spirit floating around it's not going to be and listen don't get me wrong it's not going to be a light comes in the room i read you all quote a couple of sundays ago where brother brown said that light was not the son of man that light had a form to heal it was jesus christ there's no doubt but he was there to heal the people and save them but positionally place somebody you got to have god in human flesh here you've got to have god speaking through human flesh to have to come to adoption this is my beloved son whom i'm pleased to dwell hear ye him everybody all right with that you got a little bit of silence there but that's okay think about it i don't think we've got i don't think we've grasped what we got and what we need and what we're going to and what we're heading for but somebody is going to get it for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly in other words to fall but by reason of him who i subjected the same in hope genesis 3 15 i'll put enmity in other words god said i'm going to put this thing back together i'm not going to i'm not going to depend on adam anymore surely not going to depend on eve anymore but i'm going to depend on myself same way with abraham remember he got an unconditional covenant who made the covenant god he swore by who his self he's going to have a bride that's going to speak in the end time you just got to decide whether you want to be a part of it or do you want to stay down there and go back and eat manna because the creature itself also shall be delivered thank god shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption and to the glorious liberty of the children of god we're heading toward a body change folks that's heading toward a body change because where is the corruption if you have the new birth the corruption is not in your soul where's your corruption for we know do we that the whole creation growneth and travails in pain together until right now now now let's read a couple of these and then we'll close let's go to number five i keep looking over here they want me to look up here because the way the screen is in the back so i'm gonna look here now in the spiritual sense after we were born into christ we become children of god lord now watch but then see god knows best now in the spiritual sense after we're born into christ we become children of god period but there must be more but then see god knows best because watch now here's where i say reverently disagree with my letter letter ray and brethren you think i'm persecuting the church no my dear brother no now this boy after he got a certain age he had to be adopted into that same family he was born into any minister knows that's the placing of a son he had to be adopted into the family that he was born into could you imagine that but that's the old testament teaching paul's referring to it here in the book of ephesus he brings it to ephesians because what did brother ram say ephesians parallels what joshua joshua was the placing i believe ephesians where we've been reading it that's the placing of us too all right let's go to number six and now this epistle the letter to the ephesians was written to believers not to the outside world we talked about that this is to believers this is believers that's why i thought this afternoon watch this right here that hurts some feelings right there that's why i thought this afternoon first i'd test and see if there's a group of unbelievers and sinners then i wouldn't speak this here couldn't speak this here but now seeing that it is for believers and the believers are present i thought it'd be good if we let the believer see where he was now try hard christians to understand that this day listen try hard christians to understand that this day that the message has been placing the believer in positionally placed wow if every believer in here was in their place well i'm so thankful that where the whole row of wheelchairs set there's only about two or three left in here if every believer knew their place as the lady on the cot and the man was crutches there would not be a feeble person in this building in the next 20 minutes that's right if every man could simply find his place his or her place so you sister same thing in christ what a difference it would make now i know filled your mind rolling fast he was discerning somebody was saying now brother branham i know where i'm at you think you do see that's it if you did it'd be [Music] different if you did it would be different wow number seven now after this childhood becomes of age now he's still a child but if a child was reckless and never paid any attention and wasn't so interested in the father's work that child never became adopted into the family but if he was a correct child a good child and loved the work of his father and was interested you all want to try that sometimes interested and tried to do all he could do to progress his father's work look and try he wanted to he wanted to see his father's work progress he wanted to see his father's work successful is that not what you and i are doing here i want to see my father made manifest through me i want to see my father made manifest through you [Applause] what else are we here for well brother wait we're here to make a big powerful church with a lot of money and a lot of people and a lot god can do more with 15 cents than you can do with 15 million he can do more with 10 than we do with 90. we struggle with 90 and he don't struggle none with 10 of what we got so let's don't worry about that he loved the work of his father and was interested and tried to do all he could to progress his father's work then the tudor brought that word to the father and there was what's called the placing of the son or paul gives it in galatians the adoption that we was predestinated into the adoption of children by jesus christ the adoption now the same son that was born into a family could be adopted into the same family or placed in the same family or give a position in the family that he was born into and i do believe that that is the work of the holy spirit today among the church the joshua placing is trying to place the church positionally apostles teachers prophets and so forth as we've seen many false alarms and so forth moving amongst the people which only indicates that the real genuine adoption was at hand i believe it god has to place into the church that's the business of god not man all we got to do is what be submissive to it all right number eight let's read this one let's read the the red part now if that son proved to be a right kind of son loved the father's business stayed right with his instruction what is the father's instructions the bible the word the will the father then on a certain day took that son out before the public set him on a high place clothed him in a beautiful garment and he had what they call the adoption of a son or placing a son positionally what he was they had a ceremony then the father says this is my son i adopt him or place him look this is my son he's already born into the family but now i'm going to adopt him or place him where he needs to go in my family or in my body and if they had checks in those days that son's name on a check was just as good as his father's name was because he was placed and the son could fire who he wanted to he could hire who he wanted to he was in full possession of all that the father had let's go to number nine we'll stop right here placing of a son take him out in a certain place have a ceremony before angels that's why i really believe folks in 1963 that's why brother brown went out to tucson took him up on a mountain and adopted him put a robe around him give those seven angels look at that give him all kind of sign positionally placed him and said if you're gonna hear from god you're going to hear from that man right there i'm going to open the seals but i'm going to open them through the voice of that man right there and he positionally placed him that that was his job you say oh no brother brown's job was 46 listen brother brown was born a prophet so what's what god said he's born a prophet but he come 47-63 he said that was what to get the people back the healing campaign was to get the attention he even says not in the healing campaign but when he begins to bring his message so in 1963 he brought the message he was supposed to bring that malachi 4 had already been pre produced but luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 had to be produced in the opening of the seals the mighty book with the book open all right now watch this place him positionally what he is in the body of christ then that person has the authority but power without character satanic god's not going to give you the authority because look if he gives you authority he's not going to take it away from you not an indian giver so if he gives you the authority he's going to know that you've made it to the right place all right let me say this if you count me a fanatic from this night on that very same thing that i'm speaking of will be done there'll be a power put into the church and now is coming in that the holy spirit was so anoint to people so they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen powers like that coming into the church now i know it for a fact say unto this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you've said the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the holy ghost comes into the church but wait a minute bro wait we already got the holy ghost yeah and you can sit there like a bump on a pickle i thought i'd use that i hadn't used it in a long time is that like a bump on a pickle that's a um claude why singer quote but you can you can sit there and just and die being a son you can just sit there and say well that's right i'm doing nothing else i'm not gonna raise my hands because letting it beside me ain't raising their hands this one over here ain't doing this you know what you'll be left right here the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the holy ghost comes into the church then critic's mouth will be shut it'll be a short time jesus came right off the mountain went straight to calvary um notice it won't last long but it'll be here brother branham if he was adopted in 1963 i say for you not for me in 1963 well he was he had he died in 1965. in december he didn't last long after that why short quick powerful message same way with me and you it won't last long but it will be here you can get on the bus or you cannot you can decide whether you want to go on with god or not a couple of sundays from now we'll get in to really get into where the uh the ladies when they when they had these the 12 tribes are the 12 men that was the children of israel that started the nation of israel the prophet of god said whatever they screamed their name that they screamed at their birth that's what positionally placed them but now remember it took 400 and something years for that to happen remember they were born and then they were told you'll be in captivity for 400 years and god will bring you out with a mighty hand and then you're going to go 40 or more years in the wilderness then god's going to place you so it's not going to be an instant thing this is not listen this gospel is not a microwave gospel everybody know what i'm talking about this is a crock-pot gospel you turn it on and slowly it cooks how do you cook a frog how do you cook a live frog you're supposed to cook them live right you don't put them in boiling water who's going to eat a frog you put them you don't put me boiling water you put them in warm water let them get cozy in about every five minutes you keep turning it up about 20 degrees at a time it'll cook that frog but he won't know anything about it satan's the same way we're going to cook satan he can do whatever he wants to do but look the church the power of god will be here i promise you that's our mandate that we bring it here it's here already it's just got to step into human flesh and start producing itself let's stand to our feet brother boyd's class and young adults practice after second service don't forget that uh you know sometimes the devil does get on you and he says well these people are getting bored listen if you if you're bored with just reading scripture you need a new birth i mean if you're bored with just reading scripture because i thought it was a live word i just want it to be made in in me and you i want to be able to see it brother dale wants to be able to see it brother bob all the different ministers wants brother louise there and want to be able to see it come alive what have we always told you at christmas time it don't matter you can get brother dale the taj mahal okay everybody who don't know that is google it it'll be on one of them channels or one of my places but the taj mahal is probably you can't buy it but anyway you could give him the taj mahal but he'd have he want one thing for you to produce what he's preached for 50 years and he's clapping that's what he wants he wants you to produce what he's been preaching because that's the only thing we do as ministers we want you to produce what we're preaching pretty but it's it's our mandate it's what we're going to have to do we've got to come to adoption we've got to come to where listen we'll talk about a little bit later on but even even these testimonies that people give to me that's positionally placed in this because what's it doing it's giving you more confidence in god and what he's doing in your life and even the little things that he's doing not so not the great big things the little things that he's doing in our life that's positionally placing us that's helping us to what grow to where if this next situation comes it's not going to be a tragedy anymore it's going to be a bump in the road then that then that bump in the road is going to be just a pebble then that pebble is going to be a grain of sand then then it ain't going to be where you don't even have to worry about that anymore to me that's growth not growth is just one time you come in here and then the power of god hits you and you prophesy and tell everybody what the problem is and and what's going on and all this stuff and that's okay but then brother brown said it was a life lived the life lived is the bottom line in how you handle god in your life or how god handles you in your life is the whole that's the whole thing you know what that is folks that's god in human flesh with the preeminence as brother brown was talking about it in christ in mystery gardenville with him having the preeminence in your life let's sing a song god bless you [Music] [Applause] you have been true [Music] i will see you in the rapture some sweet days sing it to him [Applause] [Music] it's not going to be a day on the calendar we got to get ready [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] forever [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] i'll see you in the rapture i'll see you at that meeting [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i'll [Music] you know when brother branham used that story about the armored meat packing boy that they saw the little girl not the three little denominational kids that he said they saw but that one girl the watch girl the one that was playing but you know when that armor meat packing boy he said i want to marry you and i'll come back in a year and i'm going to pick you up from this day i'm going to pick you up in one year now what about if that girl would have just sat down and not done anything for a year well he said he's coming back he said he's coming to get me and he'll be back in a year so i'm just going to sit here and wait on him no if she did not the story goes she was standing on the porch fully clothed in her bridal gown because she believed not so much that he was just gonna might come she was expecting him to come [Music] his wife made herself ready [Music] his future wife was standing there with everything she didn't have dish water on her hands she done moved up a little bit in her position i don't believe she was back there doing that today that he was coming no she got cleaned up she put on the white garment she put everything on and she wasn't dirty she was ready to go though because he had told her a year ago one year she had to wait doesn't matter how many years we have to wait just be ready get clothed in the garment that you're supposed to be in find our position and listen not just find our position we're going to talk about finding it and using it because manifestation means to let it go or to tell or to what make known what's inside of you listen the whole world knows there's a god some kind of god something right then you come on down to the to the christian world and there's three of them to them right father son holy ghost there's three of them to them but now with me and you we know there's one true and living god we know who he is we know where he's talking we know where to meet him at we know what he requires and we know the promise that he's already given us we're way ahead of the world but god at one period of time though he wants to use me and you to show this world he's back here in flesh me and you these testimonies the different things the things that go on in our life and and the supernatural that happens that's your position that's your manifestation that's what you're supposed to do that's a mandate from god and somebody's going to reach that some are not some are going to the three sisters they were still there they thought he was coming to get them right they actually told her they laughed at her he's not coming to get you he's coming to get us he didn't really mean that he didn't really mean that doctrine oh never mind so um he come back to pick up the one that he promised he told that girl he said i'm coming to get you and in one year i'm gonna be right here coming to get you and remember the story brother he can tell the story better than anybody he said a few minutes until time and said to them sisters they move worldly people denominational people then ah he ain't coming back he ain't coming back he ain't coming back she said he promised me he's coming back and what did they hear right about right about the time he's supposed to be there they hear the boat board i hear the sound of a mighty russian wind coming to get me and you let's sing that swing low sweet chariot and then we'll be dismissed well i looked over jordan and what did i see coming for to carry me home was a band of angels coming after me coming for to carry me home [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what a promise carry me home well if you get there before i do tell them i'm coming coming for to carry me [Music] remember brother aaron was tonight chariot [Music] well i looked over jordan and what did i see coming for to carry me home a band of angels coming after me sweet you
