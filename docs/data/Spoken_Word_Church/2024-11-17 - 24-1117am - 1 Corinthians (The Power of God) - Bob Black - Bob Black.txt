========================================

I'm switch GE again and and this morning just start studying through the book of Corinthians and uh and uh the boy the book of Corinthians has some good things about just life and and uh and and situations and um but uh the first chapter in Corinthians if the brothers can pull that up is is is kind of dealing with um uh Paul makes mention of this statement the power of God so I wanted to kind of look at that this morning and uh before we get into the scripture let's just bow our his and and uh go to the author Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word this morning and I pray God that you'll Lord just move among us to Quicken it to us Lord Jesus and to give us the real essence of the meaning as we walk through these scriptures God I pray you'll guide us today Lord open our hearts help us Lord Jesus to understand be with us Lord Jesus that you'll be in our midst today we ask in your name amen is it not working I'm I'm asking to the air I think I got it connected right Brothers reconnect let's try that there we go there we go um technology all right power of God now uh before we get into this you can you can kind of get a sense already of what the power of God is that Paul said it's the preaching of the gospel and that's that's something to kind of meditate on why why is that and and uh as as we'll study this out Paul is kind of setting in our our mind well you know you can you can look at this scene of an old timey gospel preacher preaching and and everybody's listening to him and it's it's kind of odd the way that God sets this up is that there's a man behind the pull pit that you can look at that he's got the word and so you the the the kind of the struggle is is is you you start people start looking at the man versus the word now the power of God is the word word but if you start looking at the man then you get off kilter now that's the thing that that uh Paul starts kind of attacking and in this in this first chapter but before we get into that let's just kind of think about um the relationship between the Corinth you know we we know the Corinthian Church is a is a uh uh was the little baby church that had a lot of issues and and and and we'll get into why but you know uh Paul when he when he wound up you can see where how close Ephesus is to Corinth it's just uh well not close but um just just across the way there and Paul when he wound up in the in the coast of Ephesus in uh about 8053 you know he found out that they were uh they had they were being baptizing and according to John's baptism but they didn't know anything about the Holy Ghost so he he began to stay around there and position them and and uh uh and and kind of instruct them a little bit and left them with Aquilla and Priscilla and then and uh about 10 years later he was in Rome in prison and he wrote the he wrote back to the to the Ephesian church and and by then you think about that 10 10 years later they were a strong church that knew what they were uh what what they were Paul was able to teach them about the melchisedec and all of those kind of things but during that first little visit to Ephesus uh you can read in 1 Corinthians 16 he said I'm going to stay in Ephesus until Pentecost so Paul's writing to the Corinthians from Ephesus um so that's just kind of a little interesting context there's a strong church that he or what will be a strong church that he's writing to this little weaker church this little baby Church um to kind of get them positioned and get them straightened up so he wrote this letter the first Corin the the the letters to the Corinthians he wrote this these letters to correct and guide the Corinthian Believers many of whom were CAU up in Sensations and superficial demon demonstrations now remember kind of maybe keep in mind what we were kind of laboring on the other the other Sunday about anointed ones it it's it's the word that's the main thing and so they were getting caught up in Sensations and things that that you know think the the minor the minor things instead of that they weren't really looking quite at the right thing they getting caught like as we'll find out in in the first chapter getting caught caught up looking at the people the ministers instead of the word that they're preaching and that led to division and immaturity in the Christian walk so you can see in 1 Corinthians chapter 3 Paul says I I Brethren I couldn't speak to you as unto spiritual but you're carnal even as un babies in Christ that's the way that I have to talk to y'all um because you you know we we always say you I wouldn't want to get a if if you're misbehaving well you'd get a letter from Paul you know Paul he's he's he's wording this pretty strongly isn't he you think about Paul uh here as we'll read in in in the first chapter he heard from the house of Khloe that some they were they weren't behaving right and Paul gets his pen out and goes to WR now Paul he'd say some some kind of harsh things you know i' do you want me to come to you with a rod or with a spirit of meekness you know and and he' lay it out there for him uh uh so he's he's like I I fed you with milk and not with meat for hither to you were not able to Bear it neither yet now are ye able for ye are yet carnal what why what what makes you carnal is when you're just you're majoring on Sensations and feelings and which minister you're following and what church you go to and you're putting your identity on those things instead of the word of God that's carnal for whereas there is among you envying strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men so you know just to kind of compare quickly the cor Corinthians versus Ephesians like we were just looking at the Corinthians were focused heavily on experiencing the supernatural now now there's the balance in it we we want to experience the supernatural but but when you start leaning so much toward that side and you're not looking at the word that's when you got a problem the Ephesians were considered more rooted in their identity in Christ the Ephesians they knew they knew where they stood they knew their their identity was in the word of God not in all of those other things Paul could so Paul could focus on building them up spiritually explaining predestination inheritance in Christ and spiritual warfare and all those things that he couldn't talk to Corinthians about but the Corinthians they they face confusion especially regarding spiritual gifts revelatory experiences how to worship all those things so Paul addressed rampant disorder such as Christians exalting certain Supernatural experiences above others now to really understand the book of Corinthians you kind of got to understand the the the the context of what what he was preaching preaching to you know he would use they had this saying that well the uh stomach's uh food is for the stomach and stomach's for the food another words that and and Paul would use that against them he'd poke it so you say stomach's for the food and food's for the stomach in other words if you have a carnal desire in you then you might as well fulfill it and they would they would put that on like like go to the buffet you might as well eat all you want cuz you you got a desire and you might as well do that and the same way if you have a sexual desire you might as well fulfill that so he's he that was the context the background that they're they're they're in so and the reason for that is because in in uh at at the top of this hill called the aqua Corinth there was a big old Temple to Aphrodite and and this historian called strabo said that there was a thousand Temple prostitutes up there and so the way that the Corinthians would worship is they would actually go up to that Temple and engage with the prostitutes and so it was so Eng great you think about a society where they're they're worship in like that that's how they worship and and and if you're a Christian and you don't do that then you're you're you're odd you're very odd cuz that's that that's how the Corinthians uh that that was the mode that their society worked at so this kind of gives you an idea a background of what Paul is attacking with his doctrine that that you can't you can't and now maybe maybe just lay it out like this that we'll we think sometimes as we read this that this was a historical thing that does not have any really application to modern society but I just want to warn you again it absolutely does people get caught up in these things caught up in these ideas even today even message Believers and things that well I've even you know you come across people that they are raising their family up with the standard well I if you have an appetite for something you might as well fulfill it and I I just want to lay that out there as Paul did that that is wrong we we we want to raise ra you heard that saying raise your raise your boys to be gentlemen and your girls to accept nothing less you you want to raise your family up with a standard of Holiness even if they're not born again they're living in your home and you raise them up with that standard that we're we're not going to go behave ourself like a Corinthian and and you can see here that the the Greeks actually had a a word a slang word in the Greek language called that it was a Greek word but it meant to corinthianize which meant to practice sexual immorality and that's how bad the Corinthians were is that they they it actually became a BL a by word to corinthianize just just to fulfill your appetite like that saying that Paul used at them uh stomach for food and food for stomach so divisions now we're going to kind of skip over the first part of that chap of chapter one where Paul is is is he does his greeting and and tells them that you're you're called to be to be Saints and all of those different kind of things but when he gets down to verse 10 then he really starts he he gets that paddle out and he goes he goes to writing at him and he says now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing so they got they got divisions on them and and we want to examine why they got divisions because that the same reason why they had divisions is the same thing that divides many Believers even today but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment for it had been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are of the House of Khloe that there are contentions among you so there's a little sister named Khloe we don't know much about her but I got like just a little a little illustration of a house what it could have looked like and of course we don't know she might have been a a a more wealthy person that lived in Corinth she might have had a house with with servants or or slaves even who knows and but somebody in that house got wind that uh they begin to notice some things were off and they they let Paul know so Paul's writing First Corinthians because Khloe somebody in Khloe's house told on them and so Paul's going to set things straight he said now this I say that every one of you saith now now here's where the divisions are coming in here's every one of you say saith I am of Paul they're looking at the man for their identity right I'm a Paul cuz he you know he started he's he's laying out the church age it'd be pretty good to say you're I'm a Paul right you'd think like that I of Apollos Apollos was like one of those preachers boy he could just sling the word out and leave everybody and oh wow I've never heard preaching like that I of sephus Peter Peter you see it'd be good to say well I'm a Peter brother brandom said that Peter was the only one that could open up the door of the Holy Ghost the Jews the Gentiles and the Samaritans now You' you'd think it'd be pretty good to just kind of grab onto his coattails and say well I'm I'm making my him my identity I'm identifying my Christian walk with Peter or or even some would say of Christ to say that they're more spiritual than others to that's that's what they're getting at so so Paul's laying it out he he he says to say I'm a Paul following Paul we found of the church or I'm a Apollos following Apollos who was known for his eloquence or I'm of sephus following the most prominent Apostle or I'm of Christ possibly claiming a superior spiritual status so Paul says now this I say that every one of you saith I am of Paul and I have Apollos I have I have sephus and I have Christ is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul I thank God that I baptized none of you but Crispus and gas lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name and I baptized also the household of stefanus besides I know not whether I baptized any other for Christ sent me not to baptize now now here's this is where he's setting up the division he he didn't send me to do all these things but he sent me to preach the gospel now there's what we're getting the power of God is in the word not in not in a man that you're looking at not somebody where you and this is where it gets confused we're going to look over here in the book of Acts for a second where Peter pet everybody Peter's the one laying hands on Believers and they're receiving the Holy Ghost Peter's the one that's preaching the gospel and and signs and wonders are being done and the trap is that you start identifying yourself with the man instead of the word of God now that's that's kind of a a he so Paul let me just finish that that scripture he said for Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect Now isn't that kind of an interesting dilemma that you've got a man that's carrying the Bible and you start looking at the man instead of the word it it's it's the man up there that's that's laying hands on people and praying for them like Peter was doing in the book of Acts chapter 8 but it's the word their faith in the word of God not the faith in the man that actually does the does the work if you start look believing in the man then then it it you there's nothing concrete there that will actually give you Deliverance or healing or anything like that but the word of God is the thing that powers us the word of God is is actually well Paul would lay it out is it's the power of God in other words the word of God brings life the word of God brings Deliverance the word of God brings healing the word of God makes the chains fall off the word of God but you start looking at the man and everything gets gets uh gets off-kilter so that's what the Corinth were doing the Corinthians were essentially creating competing versions of Christianity based on which leader they followed they weren't just picking favorites they were staking their entire spiritual identity and validating their salvation on their association with particular leaders so in other words saying well if you don't go to my church you're out or if you don't follow a particular preacher you're out or if you aren't in my group you're out that's that's what uh that that's what created divisions then and that's what created divisions now is instead of looking singularly like they did on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell at the word of God and that what God promised instead began to look at at at at the people right so this was and and these are just my notes just some just some statements here to kind of keep me in line but this was far more serious than just picking teams that were creating different brands of Christianity basing their spiritual legitimacy on their chosen leader and using their leader associations as proof of their spiritual superiority effectively creating different gospels based on who baptized them or taught them well if Paul baptized me then that's how that was that's what makes me a Christian no what makes us a Christian is the word of God grabs a hold of our life and changes us well if I go to this particular church that what makes me a Christian no if if the word of God changed your life that's what makes you a Christian now and and you can see you brother BR would say the three things that catches a minister is money women and popularity well what po what's popularity is to be in the word and change the meaning of the word so that instead of looking at the word they're looking at the man instead of you instead of they're looking at the man instead of the word that's and and and and uh so I I want you to just look at how amazing this is really in First Corinthians that Paul could have taken the opportunity to say yeah y'all do need to look at me but instead he directed them back to the word just like brother branam would do he'd say I don't want I'm not getting everybody to look at me I want you to look at Christ Christ is always the main thing that's right amen am now compare that with uh over in the book of Acts there was this man the Simon the Sorcerer he's called the sorcerer because it says he was bewitching the people that that he was G giving out that he was the power of God now contrast this this is exactly what we're talking about the word is the power of God versus Simon rising up and saying no I'm the power of God in Acts chapter 8 it says there was a certain man called Simon which Before Time in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of Samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of God and to him they had regard because that of long time he had Bewitched them with sorceries and it doesn't explain what kind of sorceries it it could have been uh magic tricks it could have been parlor tricks it could have been something to it something under the order to make them think that this man had the power of God but when they believe Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God in the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women then Simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with Philip and wondering wondered beholding the Miracles and signs which were done now this is this is kind of an important little story because this is always what they threw in brother brandom's face everywhere he went you're Simon the Sorcerer And and brother Bram would it it's you look at this is such an odd situation because here's Peter that laying hands on people and the Holy Ghost would fall and and it seems odd that because it's like you uh trying to trying to think how to frame it the one that's laying hands on on on the sick and they're recovering the one that's engaged it looks like like even today where people are poking at brother brandham and saying that's false but that was the one that was genuine but the one that that brother brandham said had like a a well let's see what he said about Simon the Sorcerer he said Simon the Sorcerer had a church and it was a formal Church perhaps a state church and he had them all bound down bound down by what bound down by believing that he was the only one that had the truth and they didn't have no joy and they didn't have any power but when Philip come down he preached to them Christ resurrected great joy came and healing came and then Simon wanted to buy that power see how backward they had it it was the formal stiff one that had was doing the sorcery not the healing or the power power of the Holy Ghost it was just vice versa now where does the power come from the power comes from the gospel the power comes from the word of God so the question is you know where where do you get your identification you know if you if you say you're identified because you're following a certain man or something like that and brother brandom always pointed to Jesus Christ every genuine preacher will always point to Jesus Jesus Christ we don't get identification from a man we get it from the word of God now I I just to kind of belabor the point you know that can that can work in a in a harmful way I was listening to one of the a very popular preacher that uh was sharing how that uh he was sitting in church when he was a young man I'm not going to say his name because I don't know if he wants this story shared but he was sitting in church and a minister came down the aisle and just looked at him and said I tell you what your problem is you got a problem of Pride and and if you're getting your identification from the preacher instead of from the word of God then you can do like he did and he said it it just he went into a just a a place of Despair and wondering if there was something wrong with him until he began to well what he did he talked to another Minister and he told him well that brother just that brother says that kind of stuff all the time and and and so you know you puts it in a different category stop looking and listening and just what someone's opinion about you and look to the word of God and in other words the word of God is where you where the word of God is the only standard of whether you're born again or whether you're really a holy ghost believer of whether you're doing right it's the word of God the word of God is you can get so caught up in whether somebody likes you or whether somebody doesn't like you and that doesn't not matter as much as the word of God I remember even in my own life I remember a time when when uh you know coming out of church or uh uh at this at this particular place and all of these Believers were ga gathered around and this brother got in my face and he began to tell me well you're I'll tell you what your problem is you just want popularity and and you that's a good thing to ask you know you you you just want popularity you just you're just a popularity preacher and it it uh and I'm sharing this because it'll give you Liberty you you began to you because I was you know I began to realize later that I was seeking my identification from what somebody else said instead of from the word of God and it'll bring you to a place where you just well it did for me where I I was in such a state of desperation and despair and depression that my wife would even say now she said I didn't know I thought that you had stopped loving me it brought me to such a low place because I was relying on what somebody else said about me now now where you can apply this is people always want to label you they want to label you as a Pentecostal they want to label you as an intellectual they want to label you as a prideful person or is that somebody that just wants popularity that just wants to seek after your own fame or fortune or whatever but none of that matters what matters is what the word of God says so where you get your identification is is the word of God now that if you really take that to heart I I think it'll give you Liberty to not not be so caring about whether somebody says that you're yeah you know whatever that you're mean or this or whatever a long list of attributes that somebody can label you on your life when you're trying to please somebody else or trying to get your identification from a minister or something that that you will always fall short your identification comes from maybe go back and listen to the sermon identification that's a good one to listen to your identification comes from the word of God Amen so Paul saying in 1 Corinthians chap 1 verse 17 to 18 he said for Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God now there's a just justos that the power of God to the world is a bunch of foolishness and it's foolishness it was foolishness to the Corinthians because to the ancient world the idea of worshiping a crucified savior SE berser the the cross is the is the foolishness to the world Greeks valued sophisticated philosophy and wisdom Jews expected a triumphant powerful Messiah the con the concept of salvation through a crucified man seemed illogical to both groups but it's the power of God what appears as foolishness to human wisdom is actually God's deepest wisdom the foolish message of the cross actually demonstrates God's power this apparent weakness overcomes human strength this seeming foolishness overcomes human wisdom and the Seal of God brother R would say what is the gospel not the word only Paul said the gospel come not to come to us not in word only but through Power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost come the gospel amen that's why it's the power Paul said I never come with some Seminary Ed ation come making big swell words for your salvation to be based upon swelled words and enchanting lips and some doxology or Apostles Creed or something like that I never come to you like that but I come to you knowing only one thing the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost God give us some more Pauls so what is the gospel the gospel you seow the the seed of the word in in a heart of an of a of real believer and it will do like a little Lily that begins to just begins to grow and grow up through the mud and all the muck and the m and it will you you talk about a power a power is where life is where when you're you're sitting there in church and maybe nobody else is is is reacting or responding but something begins to react in your heart like brother brand would say and look into the Unseen something begins to pulsate and it begins to move and the word of God planted in that good ground of a of a ped heart will begin to affect change and it will begin to grow up it will get it'll do something it will do something the power of the Gospel is to bring new life I got this little uh drawing that somebody made in one of Billy Sunday's sermons uh could you imagine sitting in a in a in a in a sermon where where the preacher gets up on top of the pulpit like that he's preaching some something that's alive he's preaching something that will actually do something in people's hearts and lives so preaching is the means I got a lot of notes here I'm just going to skim through that it's the means by which God has ordained his power to manifest in the lives of Believers and as the eagle stirreth up her nest he said oh I like to have sheep food good food the power of God the word of God the Holy Ghost feeds on it that's what the church needs tonight is good solid gospel preaching gospel teaching gospel salvation and a Gospel Holy Ghost we're not so interested in what this nation might not need a new president the city might not need a new mayor but what we need today is a good old time Saint Paul's Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost back in the church again that's what we need sheep food sheep fed on sheep food so in verse 19 he says for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent where is the wise Where is the describe where is the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom do not God it please God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe now it that that's this is such a good chapter for anybody that doesn't no longer believes in the preaching of the Gospel anymore that that would just sit home by themselves and and and try to understand by themselves but I I I thank God that he give us words like this to frame everything to put everything together to know that when you come and sit in church it ain't in vain that something's happening just as much as when you go to the ocean and you can see the you can't see the water evaporating and turning into a cloud and turning into rainfall but Something's Happened nonetheless because preaching is the power of God in your life God bless you [Applause] Saints for
