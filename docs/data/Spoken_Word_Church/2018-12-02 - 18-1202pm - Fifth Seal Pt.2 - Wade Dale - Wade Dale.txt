     O Lamb of God, come forward, we pray. We call on You, Lord, the great Redeemer. Come forth and show us Your plan of redemption that's been hid through the years, breaking this Fifth Seal for us tonight, Father, and revealing what's beneath that Seal for us, that we might go away a better Christians than we are now--might be better fit for the task that lays ahead. We ask it in Jesus' Name. Amen.

«  25       †        Well, now, I get started on them subjects, and we just talk on, and the people around the walls and standing in the halls and the rooms and so forth. So I'll get right straight to the message, and I want to say this... Now, I want to give thanks to Him Who's omnipresent, and that today, not knowing one thing about that Fifth Seal, it came in that same mysterious way this morning, just about a hour before daybreak that when I was out in prayer.

«  40       †        Now, this is rather a mysterious... And now, for the sake of tapes, and clergymen and teachers that's setting present, now if you have a different view from this, I did too. But I'm just taking it from the inspiration which completely changed my view of it. See?
And then I find out, as you see these revealed, it's taking right back and bringing those church ages and the Scriptures right together, tying it up. See? And that's the reason that I believe that it comes from God.

rush dunker from Minnesota sent me a text this morning said he has five inches of snow on the ground I said we got five inches of rain on the ground so the difference the difference both Donnie was it was 28 up there and it was 58 here so but he sends his greetings and and his blessings on all of us so good to be in the house of the Lord let's go and turn to the book of Revelation six let's continue our thought we're on the second part of the of the fifth seal we're just gonna review again today and bring a few thoughts a couple of thoughts I want to cover today but let's go ahead and and start go to revelation 6 verse 9 and let's bow our head before we get started the only father Lord today we've set aside a time to hear from You Lord now I pray Lord that the time will be not it'll be not just a waste of time Lord that it would be a revelation in our heart something to keep and hold and and nourish us through the week and nourish us through our life Lord we're coming down toward the end and the final push I believe it's going on now so Lord just come among us and reveal yourself to us because without you here Lord doing the speaking Lord they would be just a meeting of minds but lord I pray that that meeting of minds will all come under the come under the umbrella of the Holy Spirit today Lord and that you'll come among us Lord and heal the sick ones out in the building father and the ones that are not with us Lord may they may they receive their healing now father you already did it at Calvary may they just believe now Lord let's just be with us take care of us be with the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor father just forgive us of our sins and our mistakes clear our minds and our hearts for just a little while that we speak about you in Jesus name we pray amen revelation 6 verse 9 and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth question and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled you may be seated in the Lord as blessing to the reading of the word prop man brother Danny is not here today so he's little under the weather Regina did you did you make this the a team just because Terrence is on this side huh he's always talking about sending the B team to do stuffing so now you got the B team over here and a team over here I don't know if he paid you to say that or what no you didn't okay all right maybe it was just a devil I don't know but some said they couldn't see this so I want to kind of go over it again but I know it's got a glare to it and it's not real black looking but whole thing I can tell you to do is is tomorrow when they are this evening when they upload it guys I want you to zoom in on this thing here they got a camera on it now to zoom in on it and just kind of if you want to see it happen go to the website and view this again and then you can see what I'm talking about so just get a flash of it and you'll know kind of what we're doing I know it's hard for the ones in the back cause a long building to see but I know there's that was about four people came up to me Sunday afternoon and even Wednesday night and said that that kind of cleared up a lot that that they had that we admit doing the four seals because we come under here and we see that that we take a rapture so when we take a rapture then what's going to happen is is God starts dealing with the Jews right so God starts dealing with the Jews then that's not for us but but Co five six and seven to me is one of the most important ones because it has to come back under here and as I said before steal one two three and four tells us the whole plan of redemption that's the whole plan of redemption that's what that's thanks that's the mind of God all right seal five six and seven tell us how this happens tell us why and the all white brother Brown will read it in just a little while but I want to cover two things real quick I want to read that quote that I found because I want us to realize we are I read you the quote the other day about 20 times where brother Branham says that when when we come under the revelation of the Son of Man it comes in a different way it's different from the Son of God revelation the son of man revelation is something that man has never come under and then we ting up now listen though because of our traditions are we staying where we added up moving on into the son of man revelation is that okay all right brother brother Dale's talking about the horse forehead well yeah it's all of our ideas that we have we got to get rid of the denominationalism in our mind it's not in your soul well the denominational lives them wasn't in Martin Luther so we'll either because if he had the true baptism of the Holy Ghost that true baptism the whole goes never never spoke out of Luther's mouth that there was a Trinity but you and I have come to place that we're not looking at sinless perfection and but we're not also looking at the devil gonna beat us up all the time but you know what if you if you take the son of man take the Matthew Mark Luke and John and look at the things that with Jesus's life I was telling them in Sunday School class this morning he was so much man he was so much mantle they didn't believe who he was his humanity hid everything that whole the whole Old Testament that the priest lived by everyday they knew that word letter-by-letter and Jesus came exactly the way that the Old Testament said he didn't miss one scripture and they called him a devil they called him a demon they said you're a wine-bibber so he must have drunk a lot of wine you you what you sure don't hang around us Messi's believers where'd that come from you didn't hang around those message believers that really that's what they were saying you're not a Pharisee you're not a sad you see we can't put you anywhere so we just gonna make you a devil but he came exactly the way they said and you said well that's don't have anything to do that with the fifth seal yes it does because they were blinded the Jews were blinded so that we could come in they were blinded they had the Torah to the letter and Jesus came the exactly was supposed to but in his humanity because he didn't because he didn't go right up the Caiaphas and sake office I'm God and you're my partner you know Joe Caiaphas wanted a little bit of the credit conference was little he was a high priest and I believe you had a little head a little hot problem itself not that statue height but you know what I mean but because he was a high priest but because Jesus didn't come the way they thought it was they called him bill Zebub they're gonna do the same thing to you when we move into the son of man revelation the reason I'm bringing you this it's going to be something that the traditions that you've been brought up under and I've been brought up under has to be changed it has to be a totally different mindset than what we've ever experienced and you know what's going to happen they're going to call you belzebub they're gonna say you don't believe the message like we do praise God but that's what the seals are for folks that's the son of man revelation revelation we've never had before that's a revelation we got to come under that when brother Branham starts speaking of these things and speaking of the son of man and the son of man himself start speaking Matthew Mark Luke and John we must adhere to that not him to us so we must see what he's talking about you know I want to cover a couple of things number one even Jesus didn't have sinless perfection he learned by the things he he learned by the things he suffered and being made perfect thank you being made perfect I'm just reading the Bible right so let's get this thing you send this perfection thing out of the way it's like us me and brother Bob was talking you know you it's kind of it becomes if you need something God's gonna be there but if you go driving down the road in your car sitting on a and you drive by five service stations and you run out of gas and you say God why didn't you fill my tank he said I sent you five stations back in under I like what brother Brady said brother Brady said you know what we're all Christians we're all spiritual people but God give us five senses use them just because your motor blows up in your car you know it might mean it's got 400,000 miles on it I told the church they are downstairs this morning listen like it or not we're trapped in this first three dimension life light and matter we're trapped here we can't go into four four comes here we surely not going into five if you're born again and cinch you're just a place to hold him but in other words we can't we're stuck in one two and three all right so you know what if we need something God will supply our needs if you know even that brother Cleveland when he when he was giving his testimony about brother Branham praying for the his brakes or whatever that was it was it was the brakes or whatever it was it was going bad well now brother Cleveland didn't tell the whole story now he might have never put brakes on that till he sold it but I'll guarantee you the tires rested wore out I'll guarantee you he had to put all in the motor and he probably had to fill the gas tank up you see what God what we're talking about you said well if we are who we say we are then our car should be come on people please summer no church age brother Brown says the cloudy skies and storms of life are no sign of God's disapproval neither are bright skies in Stillwater of his love and approval his approval of any of us it's only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so he said so I said that's why and then I want to cover another thing we were talking to Bible study the point was brought up and I want to I want to go over this again because I may have made it a little bit strong but I want to read you what brother Brown said we're talking about laying on of hands and prayer lines I don't have a problem with prayer line if you need them but it's not the way it should be it is not the way it should be I'll prove it to you brother Bramson hebrews chapter six baptism laying on of hands even paul covers this paul covers laying on their hands and all these things get away move up go on to perfection that's what I'm telling you about the Son of Man our problem is is we get stuck in a rut we get stuck in our old beliefs that we have to have this we don't have to have this it's not even for us baptism Lent little hands that isn't perfect that's only carnal reform that brother brown calls the laying on of hands carnal reform and that's where the church leaves off today is on that carnal reform Wow Jesus Christ same yesterday day in there from 1958 there's very few people that are really come up and contacted by laying on of hands my ministry is not that now where did we get it from where do we get it from Pentecost my ministry is not that we realized that that's a great ministry because you can't take Leno hands out because it's in the Bible but the Bible says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but ministry of laying on of hands was a Jewish son the roman centurion said just speak the word that's it the Gentile Jesus turned to said I haven't seen any faith in Israel just speak the word because what happened now bear this in mind that Roman knew that every sickness and disease was subject to his word now if we can realize the same it's all over see when you can realize the same that every demon every sickness every disease every fliction is subject to the Word of God just beat the word of my servant will get better 19:59 my new ministry now in the American people has been caught he said caught caught a Jewish custom of laying on of hands this is my new ministry in 1959 East 7 Los Angeles California that's not a Gentile custom everybody got that say Amen I'm just reading what he said the ministry has not been my ministry to lay hands on the sick it's not being it it's been to make by a divine gift to bring presents the Lord Jesus Christ in presence by discernment of Spirit which is called in the Bible a gift of knowledge and in doing so make him manifest before the people and then they receive him as their healer that settles it blind bartimaeus 1959 I want to speak to the audience just a moment my ministry is just a little later signed to the church than laying on of hands hmm laying on them hands was a Jewish custom when Jairus daughter was dying was dead Jairus said Jesus come lay your hands on them now we've had signs of laying on of hands all down through 2000 years but now we're at the closing of the age it's something different now I'm telling you what the Prophet said it's something different now my ministry is through a spirit of discernment that it might manifest Jesus Christ presence that lamb that we are speaking of this been slain conferences with God 1959 now we've been preaching this week the Jewish custom for people in the Jewish time was to go way hands on the sick that's what they did everything was laying on of hands it was a Jewish order but it never was that way with the Gentiles never never all right let me read this last one right here let's watch this from here this is it is I be not afraid in 1960 so we have America is full of Jewish believers the Jewish people had a custom of laying on him hands that never was to the Gentile Church that never was to the Gentile Church no sir it was for Jews alone but we've seen many great things happen that's why I'm telling you I will and I'll stand in the prayer line with anybody I'll pray for you up here I told them you know to brother Branham we don't like the quote and brother Ram says you get weaker every time you come to the pulpit every time you come to the altar you become weaker why because you depend on that one day you're not going to be able to find somebody and you better depend on what you got I was thinking today I said the greatest army was the one that was trained well before they got to the battle not wait until they got in the battle and figured out what was going on no they got trained before they got brother Don he didn't they didn't just then just stay here drive this tank drive it over there in that field and shoot somebody you'd have died quick right same way with the Word of God I believe what God is doing now for 50 something years he's been teaching us he's been training us and he's wanting us to what believe in your seat so when I said I didn't I didn't never said I didn't believe in prayer lines I said I just don't think they work like they're supposed to and I just proved to you they don't they don't work like they're supposed to even laying over hands nothing worked like he's supposed to he said that's a Jewish tradition alone you saw that not even for the Gentile Church we have developed it and you know what brother Branham remembering the third pull where the angel says brother Brown this is the third pull right but remember when he was talking about the fishing and he got the line all tangled up what did the angel tell him you've explained in other words you've explained this gift you got away you keep explaining it to the people he should have come out and said believe what I say and that's it because that's the Gentile way but what he had to deal with that Pentecostal like brother Dale was talking about they sold a Pentecostal doctrine brother Branham came out of that didn't stay in it he came out of it he was he was what was coming out of that Pentecostal idea but what happened a lot of that came with him and he allowed that he never wanted that he wanted it to work the way it was supposed to work he never wanted to have prayer lines he said that's not even his ministry's laying on hands so that's what I'm telling you we need to look at it different now if we're going to the son of man revelation then we're gonna see that Jesus just spoke the word even the Centurion said you just speak the word Lord and it'll happen we come to that and I'll guarantee you will come to a place we got to come to place nobody's ever come to before so why is why I'm like this if we're going in this direction and we get nowhere we're hitting that wall for fifty five years and the hole is open over here you know what we do as humans we keep going well it's kind of like to think what's insanity what's told what's the definition of total insanity it's doing the same thing over and over thinking you get a different results that's insanity but when the hole opens up over here when the son of man revelation opens up and we're supposed to go that way we need to go that way we need to start believing pray up before you get here and you may not need prayer for the city I'm talking to me two lane time I just you know one person I'm coming all of us if we come prayed up we might not need prayer right there by okay without me because really really I mean we got to come to a place to where all these other traditions tradition he called them traditions all these ideas that we had before sure God worked through them and winked at their ignorance but when we come to place of a body changed listen the prayer line was fine the prayer line would be lay hands on the sick and the people would have a great anointing and they would get healed but they're gonna die 99% of the people brother branham prayed for it in the meetings or probably already passed away physically dead so it didn't do them any good it just prolonged their life I'm talking about up that's right it's all we won't even tell what dick said that's all at 80 something years old that's all we won't anyhow just one more breath but what about a group of people though that's promised to come to a place to I was talking about this morning where brother Brian said limbs would be restored that you would speak the word and it would what pop now it didn't say every preacher it said you you say to this mountain it didn't say go to your priest or go to your preacher it says you say to this mountain be moved well you know what you got to move into something then that you don't put all your faith that's telling the church last night and this morning I believe it I like the way this church is set up because brother Del's he's not gonna patch you and pitch you and you know what that's good because you become a little bitty you're not it's strong in faith is you should be Aaron how'd you like that that good that better y'all thought I was gonna say something different in it but we're built the West sure we like brother Dale to pray for us because we know he's a man of God we know he can connect God but one can't you could it be God what if you can't get him one day I couldn't find him one day I couldn't find him you know why cuz I needed my priest to pray for me but you know what at that moment in time I needed to realize that God was dealing with me not dealing with him he wasn't dealing with me he wanted to talk to me brother Donny he won't talk to me through him he won't talk to me same way with you and I and see I believe that's what that's what the son of man revelation is the son of man revelation is is that Jesus Christ is here and he's in the form of the whole bride form of the whole bride you embody God and I got a quote I'll read later on we're brother Brennan well yeah we're brother round says you have enough power if you're born again to create a world and go live on it when you get born again it didn't say when you come up you know when you're wimping the headstone he said when you get born again you have inside of you the ability to co-create a world and go live on it he said what you're held by a bar which what these three dimensions and what the word says we got to wait till a certain time and then I believe you know when we get over to the other side create your world go live on it for a little while I I'll just be there if I want to go see you and what I mean gonna matter but listen our thought process should I hope and pray that our thought process is changing as we all ministering as we all come to this place of perfection that we see that it's not then that the blue skies is going to be the day that you get the greatest revelation or the gloomy days like spend the past three days is not a sign that God hates us it's just a sign that we're living in a perverse world that is what controlled by Satan he brought all that God didn't so we just got we can't do away with the situation we're in at the moment we can't do away with it we're locked into this but we can start from the inside and work our way out inside and work our way out and that's and that's we've already begin with all the material then we've already been given you know the the United States government wants to give their soldiers the best equipment now the United States don't build equipment to give to the Russians to kill us now that may happen but you don't want that to happen so why am I saying God didn't give the material to the devil doc didn't give his material to the Devils kids he give the material to you to give the material to me to what to understand what God's talking about and to realize that we've got to move from the horse forehead which is the NE denominational idea against that center part of the word of God you can't move one way or the other like bob was talking about you know you say well you gotta have balance really balance means you got that much weight on that side as you do on that side they ain't two sides of the word dead center there is a center pivot that we must come to we may have this idea over here and we may have this idea over here but that ain't violence the Word of God is what it is Jim jr. okay but I didn't throw anything you know I don't like that statement it is what it is I'm just kidding all right so let's get started so let's just review but I I want us to I want us to come come higher God tells us in the word come up higher come up here the revelations for come up hither in other words what John you got to come up and you got to go through that door remember there's the door open in heaven you got to go to that door well that's another dimension this right here happens in the three dimensions we live in this whole thing does but I'm going to show you something in a minute to get to this revelation of seal number five we got to go into another dimension not the fifth dimension we know where that's that but we got to go into another dimension to see this because John went into another dimension to see this Amen so we got and you know what we're gonna we remember we call this seal the grace seal ice telling them downstairs you know grace is unmerited favor right that's why you and I can't come up with grace you and I can't come up with the word grace and put a definition to it a human definition what you know why because we have this right here a list we make a list why this didn't happen while this person's this way while this person's that way that's not unmerited favor that's favor you do something to me I do something to you you've done something to me I don't have to do anything to you grace is not any of that if you did one thing to merit grace it's not grace it becomes works now your works as your faith expressed or you works as your grace expressed I know that but grace is unmerited favor now we're gonna get into that in the fifth seal so let's just review right here real quick now remember seal number one two three and four is everybody all right listen I'll do anything to further the kingdom of God but I don't want us to go backwards I don't want to go backwards going backwards is what backsliding backwards in God does never work go forward it doesn't matter if you move one grain of sand off that mountain move that one grain let that one grain roll off and believe what God's give us he's give us the Word of God and I believe he's give it to us in a progression that we can all progress now I just stay flat the whole time that we can progress and grow amen I just believe that if you don't then you need to find somewhere you where you can because we're the hours late we got to start growing up we got to start doing doing you know doing the they have the son of man mentality because that's what we're living under we're living under the son of man meant out we're living under the anointing of the Son of Man which was Jesus Christ walking on the earth among humanity right among humanity preaching the gospel done all right not to me that's percent that's pretty simple that's the son of man message all right still number one types the first Street Church age is still number two tops to fourth church age seal number three tops the next to church ages and seal number four types this is the layout of sin church age that looks kind of like Snoopy done that for those you that can see them and get that lawfully but that look most of you can't see it anyway so just laugh Julie just laugh Julie said I can't see that I said I'm a walk it just but then let you look at she don't want to let right Gary you'd be the one to go under the seat not you but I'm doing the best I can do all right so you got your there's your seven Church ages so in the seal one through four which is your wild horse your red horse your black horse and the pale horse is paralleled in the church ages everybody got that same am paralleled in the church ages the white righteous church wrote out in the first church age pure and unadulterated word they didn't have any denomination they sure they were sayings and things right but then Satan rides out with a white righteous church looking like the same then you come to the red which is red is what blood 68 million people were killed right here because they were a Christian that's a lot of red all right then the black is in the man age which is your line ox man and eagle in the man age was the black horse rider and the black horse rider that was the blackness we can say the blackness of denominations because right in here is where denominations began to be set up now Luther didn't set up as a nomination Wesley did not set up a denominator they were denominated after they left after they died all right all right there was a Lutheran in a Westland and the Baptist started and all the ones will see that was that was a name they were living by but we're dead my brother Dale was talking about you know you got the seven women let us take your name but now we don't want to live with you we don't want to be intimate with you we just want your name we'll buy our own clothes we'll buy our own groceries we'll go wherever we want to go but we want to be called by your name and he's right you go and look outside any new church and even now I think blacks replacement is not Baptist Church anymore it's some kind of you got 12 stone you got new River you've got Worship Center you got you don't hardly see any new Baptist Church pop-up or any new Methodist Church up maybe some Catholic churches do but most of them are worship centers well who's the god of worship the devil is the god of worship I'm sorry I'm just telling you what the point the Bible said it was the anointed cherub so what he's going to do is is hey don't put no don't put my name in there don't baptize in the name of Lord Jesus Christ right that's too much of my name in there you know or Satan saying no don't put too much in there you know but let's be a worship center and and truly it used to be in the Pentecostals where they would worship and they wouldn't even have a service because the the anointing was so strong well I had a baptist friend of mine just about five or six years ago he come in and said they had the most wonderful service Sunday they'd ever had in their life they worshiped for two and a half hours and had no preaching now that's not in the Bible there's a time for everything the word is always first okay so if you put everything in place it works perfect so you got the blackness of man that comes in and what it begins to denominator then you got your pale horse which is everything mixed together in this church age that's our church age right here where everything's mixed together all right now then we type justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the Word made flesh and then we see now that in the coming up to the statue of a perfect man this is not baby form justification we're talking about in the seals we've come up a little bit higher we've come up a little bit higher is as if you never done it it wasn't you got your past sins dropped off but we are beginning to realize I hope you're beginning to realize that the real you didn't do it that motivating factor inside of you if you'll let it work it never sinned so let it work its way out it's as if you never done it then we're gonna get a little bit higher where the real you you got it when you seek really when you see grace you see that the real you never did it and this doesn't mean anything this doesn't mean anything you want me to prove it you mean to prove this doesn't mean anything again one more time the woman at the well she had she was polluted by five different men and was living with one she was polluted with that one you understand what I mean physically in her body she's gonna be in the bride so God cleaned her up inside wasn't worried about the outside now she didn't go do it no more but she was defiled that girl Rosella or whatever name was there brother brown prayed for us he was a prostitute she was a drunk she had give herself over to men she's gonna be a bride but now if a girl comes up and twenty year-old girl she's virgin never been touched by a man but if she don't give her heart to Jesus Christ she's going to hell right never been defiled you got the purest body that ever was never been defiled in her life but if she don't give her heart to Jesus Christ she's bound for hell why so that's the inside person so this inside person we're working the inside out we come up here now we look at st. duplication which is to meet that sanctification to a higher level God sanctifies you what he cleans you and set you aside for service well what's he doing here he's burning the trash out to set you aside for service then adoption we come to the baptism of Holy Ghost we come to the top effective pyramid and we see now death is destroyed in the body change has to take place in this fourth seal when it opens death is destroyed why is death destroyed because we take a body change and a catching away right here so we must know that all this happens during this time so when you got pale horses everything mixed together the Word made flesh death destroyed the actually listen folks in in the bride not only death is destroyed but that Antichrist spirits destroyed in you the horse forehead all those things we're talking about that's destroyed in you that's destroyed by the brightness of his coming and the coming of the Lord is what the revealing of his word then this last age oh let's get this this is us put your name right there wherever you are put your name right there cuz if you'll put your name right there then God can work with you put yourself in a position make yourself available that God is going to make your flesh the word not just n-type not just like I said like Sunday night that's not here say it has been here safe for 2,000 years we've heard a lot of hearsay remember we've heard a lot of hearsay Mama's walking the streets to go with Jesus today no she's not but remember like I said we're not going out and telling people this but we know that we know about the Alpha knees and we know about the white robes and we know about the position that everything goes into and how the death is destroyed in us in us we are the ones that destroy death by what by the revealing of the word not by kernel reform our carnal impersonation that all right so now there's the first four seals we've been thrilled it took us about a half a year or maybe three quarters but now we're on the homestretch because we have to lap this back under here to bring in steel five because remember steel five is white robes were given to those that were Jews that God blinded their eyes right so you would think that would have nothing to do with us but it really does and we'll cover in just a little while and then your sixth seal is definitely to the Jews it's over hearing that last 70 at 70th week of the danger 70 weeks right amen so that's the two prophets the two prophets brother Branham identified the two prophets as that seal the sixth seal is those two prophets right all right and then the seventh seal brother Branham said the seventh seal brings you back to earth well he's going out to come back to earth with us first he's got to come back to earth and ice first then he comes in what fights for the Jews remember revelation 12 Michael comes down I mean story Daniel can twelve where Michael comes down and fights for the Jews coming into the Battle of Armageddon that's what the Bible says all right so the Seventh Seal brings him back to earth the Seventh Seal to you and me brings him back to earth earth our earth Bodhi earth or earth I don't everything when I think of God doing something on earth or in earth I don't think of this ball that we're living over we are the earth where the earth you know what I believe Adam said when God put Adam in that human body I believe Adam looked and said man if if this earth then I own the whole thing I'm standing on I'm a recipient of what I'm standing on what I'm standing on is earth and I've been mater that's what you and I you and I yes the whole thing alright let's go let's read a few things here mmm everybody all right I don't want to sound harsh but I want us to shake ourselves get out of that you know that mentality that we used to have all right let's read number one because we must realize and remember now see that they're from brother branham comes to this fifth seal now remember every seal if you'll read them brother branham said I had my view on it but I had to change it okay I had my view on it but I had to change it I had my view had my view and he had his view on this one on the fifth seal he thought that was the souls of the church under the altar cried how long how long right but it wasn't it was the Jews that were given white robes so let's read a few things right here on the fifth seal Lamb of God come forward we Prague we call on you Lord the great Redeemer so see we still have to put this under the plan of redemption we have to put this under the plan of redemption you can't say well what now we're look redemption is over really come redemptions over know it you got a lap that thing back and redemption won't be over until this guy comes in you that okay that's too strong swallow that comes that's you we're going to see when we get to the seventh seal the seventh seal is you you are it you are it but come forth and show us your plan of redemption that's been hit through the years breaking this fifth seal for us tonight and reveal what's beneath that seal for us that we might go away a better Christian than we are now might be better fit for the task that lays ahead we ask in Jesus name Amen number two fifth seal paragraph 25 well now I get startling in subjects we just talked on and the people around the walls sitting standing so I'll get right straight to the message and I want to say this now I want to give thanks to him whose omnipresent and that today not knowing one thing about that fifth seal it came in that same mysterious way this morning just about an hour before daybreak when I was out praying okay so it was a mystery to him okay now let's go number three fifth seal paragraph 40 now this is rather a mysterious now for the sake of tapes and clergyman and teachers that sitting president now if you have a different view from this I did too but I'm just taking it from the inspiration which completely changed my view of it see all right so it changed his view of it so if it changed a view of a prophet why wouldn't it change our view if it changed the view of the Prophet in the end time if I got that because remember it was God and brother branham they wasn't nobody in between there's nobody you can insert but will come under our prophet messenger with the final boys to the final age right so I'm telling you what he said he it changed his view of it in other words let me paraphrase he said the Bible became a brand new book it should come to become a brand new book to us don't read it with carnal reform don't read it with the horse forehead read it with total understanding now we've all had to understand you but we want to have a hundred percent understanding fifth seal nineteen I mean paragraph 69 now notice there's no mention of another beast or a living creature to this announcement of the fifth seal now remember there was on the 4th there was on the first second third and fourth but none here all right so what's that the combat beast that's the Holy Ghost all right in the people in the Gentile church age their bow right with that now a number of paragraph 83 number five now notice I love this as in the times of the right of the four horses the rider singular of the four different horses there was a beast that announced the power every time the right riders straddled another horse and come forth to ride another kind of beast come out and announced it that's a great mystery that see that is the mystery why announcing the mystery why isn't there one on this fifth seal to announce it here it is according to the revelation of the Lord Jesus give me today or this morning early that is what the mystery of the church ages are already finished at this time the mystery of the Antichrist is revealed at this time the Antichrist took his last ride and we find him on the pale horse mixed with many colors and rides all the way into perdition now let's skip the paragraph 87 but the reason that he reveals that I as I understand that it is because the mystery of the book of Redemption he's still talking about the seals being the book of redemption whose redemption yours and mine not Israel not the world you and me as far as the Antichrist being revealed and at the same time the church is gone and these things don't even happen in the church a church age at all that's right there away from the church age the church absolutely is raptured at this time the church goes up in the fourth chapter revelation and it does not return until it comes back with its king in the nineteenth chapter but these seals here are revealing what has been what is and what will be see and now what was to be for the church ages was revealed by these seals and now watch what takes place the four stages of his rider has been revealed the four stages of the Antichrist rider riding has been revealed at this time therefore they don't have to have any more any more what any more combat beasts and there was four living creatures of God to announce the rider as they rode four beasts are four powers so the Raptors took place we know that but that's what I'm telling you the first four seals if you if we if we parallel them with the church ages that's in this time element life light and matter John and when the first Hill open the first beast said John come and see they were standing in them in the dimension John was in but now the fifth dimension he's got to be away from all this it's got to be in another dimension our thoughts have got to come from another dimension because like I said you can't you can't take this you can't take this capstone grace and give it to anybody it's got to come from Almighty God Himself everybody all right with that all right now look now watch number six now notice now in the ninth verse souls under the altar now here's where I'm going to get some real disagreement but just watch for a minute think about brother Branham think about a man when he thought when he says on the seals you're not getting it of course he's not said it yet but he's fixing to say it on the question and that's on the seals but when he come into his son man ministry I'm not talking about hundreds I'm talking about thousands and maybe hundreds of thousands of people kicked him out right and when he preached mayor's in divorce he said thousands of my friends will walk away from me so he just in other words he here we go if he is what he says he is he ought to been the most popular prophet in the world Rob to the day he died no he go he didn't get worse but what his following got worse and worse and worse to where he preached the rapture message to twenty something people in a trailer that they were having a community in Arizona because they went out there to be together so they could be a brand of mine that's what they were twenty something people where he would preach to fifty thousand or he'd have five thousand in a in a in a tent but see watch he had to change his thought though but you know what it never ever discouraged him sure in his humanity he got discouraged but you never saw it on the outside you never saw it and you know he didn't woke up after the seals he goes now y'all bless God yeah yeah ain't nobody coming to visit me no more and ain't nobody coming to see me I think I'm just gonna know he preached right on just like nothing happened he preached 224 like he preached to 24,000 you know why cuz he had a message to bring and knowing that nobody in that building that was sitting there at the time would probably be alive when it become manifest knowing that another group was coming your that group your the group if there's any of these and brother Brown head of a group of people who's gonna make it it was the people sitting in front of me today you and me they don't excite you but I bet I guess it must put you to sleep y'all have Turkey for lunch today I thought now notice not a nice verse older than the altar now here's what I'm gonna get some real disagreement but just watch a minute I thought that too but it didn't come that way there was our thought process that his whole thought process had to be turned you know why so it could turn mine and yours or we wouldn't went right on in the same way loping right along but no God come to us in the form of a prophet told us the way and then he didn't leave he come right back into the message when I say message do you think these this when I say message how many of you think of books and tapes it ain't books and tapes it's you it's you you're the living message see that live it don't you listen don't walk with your head stuck up because I'll promise you look as much rain as we're having a lot of your dream but if you walk humble that God showed it to you and not fifty million other people in the world he showed it to you he give it to you it's your message you are the books in the tapes because look rapture and faith lies in the books and tapes well there's the books and tapes gonna take a rapture so what is he talking about if rapture and faith lies in the books and the tapes rap from faith lies in me and you I thought that too but it didn't come that way I've always thought that these souls under the altar look he's going to one direction we're the martyrs of the early church and I'm sure that dr. your R Smith and every one of them says it is C but I thought so myself but when the Holy Spirit showed division to it it wasn't it isn't the souls now now you say well I don't know about that well now wait a minute we'll find out these are not the souls of the bride Church waiting their souls under the altar you see crying how long Lord how long let me read it again then you read open when it opened v else on the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and then we'll cover that later on I'm just going to try to cover the whole top of it then get started next Sunday into the depth of the revelation see the Word of God and the testimony which they held now see it wasn't the testimony of Jesus Christ it was the testimony they held all right we'll read some scripture which talks about the testimony of Jesus Christ they didn't have the testimony of Jesus Christ these souls under the altar didn't even know who Jesus Christ was right all right and they cried how long Lord how long holy and true dust our judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given to every one of them and it was said to them but they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren so it's got to be then somebody alive on this side and the ones dead on this side that are brethren so they got to be of the same nationality well it's going to be the same nationality they should rest for a little season until their fellow-servants also in brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now for they at this time now that was the scripture now he's this is his quote if you notice this fifth seal being open see the church is gone so it can't be it just can't be the souls under the early church he's talking about he's talking about born again he was actually putting this fifth seal group of people in the sixth dimension because he thought it was the Saints that had went on even after he went behind the curtain of time and so I'm standing there thought about that huh this is after he went he went behind coming onto curtain time in 1960 this is 1963 he still had that same view when he saw the ones and will read it in just a minute I got something I want to show you now please if you ever did give this attention now because this is a great controversy so I want you to listen real close and you've got your papers and things too right now I want you to notice now these cannot be themselves but them soul the righteous church because the souls of the righteous martyred and the righteous people the church the bride has done been took up in other words they've already got their glorified body they're not standing in white robes somewhere they're in their glorified wearing our glorified body and worried at the wedding supper people with flesh on them right okay maybe it's a lot to process they cannot be these souls because the souls of the righteous martyred and the righteous people the church the bride has done been took up so they wouldn't be under the altar now let me explain to you a minute I tried to find how brother branham explained exactly under the altar pretty much the way I see it because I can't get enough quotes to to put anything together it's just like he said there's a there's a bar there that they can't get to Jesus Christ so there under the altar of God brother Brahim explains at one time that Jesus has you know member his body is at the right hand of God forever making intercession and everybody's underneath that that's the altar there's not an altar there with a bunch of people at the altar no it's just there in a holding place that there's a cap over that holding place that they can't get no further at the time their bow right with that so that souls under the altar okay they're not under an altar somewhere it's a it's a it's a metaphor that they're under what the sacrifice of Jesus Christ laying on the altar and they can see there's one quote where they says he can stake and see the sacrifice I don't know other things see it physically I don't know I ain't gonna argue with it but in other words that's what that altars for there's an altar of sacrifice and the blood of Jesus Christ in and the the body remember brother Brown said the bodies up there laying on the altar what ain't laying there on the altar like this lifeless we understand it's a position Jesus was at the right hand of the Father he's not standing at the right hand of a man he's the power and authority all right there by okay without so you like to look at these metaphors you have to look at these examples so they're under the altar when I look the sixth seal right now to m60 oh the sixth dimension is under the altar when brother Branham went across the curtain of time what did the guy say the guy said these are souls under the altar not them not the fifth seal Jew not to fish he'll know it was souls under the altar in the sixth dimension killed he said where's Jesus he said he's higher you can't get to him at the time in other words you're right here in a holding place all right so he separated its church the bride has done gone see the six seals I I mean the six when I say six sealed that's the sixth dimension the six dimension is emptied out right here it's empty there's nobody in the sixth dimension because that is the bride of the 2000 year church age they've done come back that's been destroyed they've took a body change it we're somewhere in another dimension at a wedding supper so it's not those people about okay with that they'd be in glory with the bright notes that has done been took up so they wouldn't be under the altar they'd been in glory with the bride because remember Jesus Christ is the only one that's reaching immortality he's right here all the sixth dimension is under here but when they come back here and get their bodies remember what they told brother Brown we don't eat here but when we come back we're longing to come back to get our bodies so that we can what be human again because they don't have flesh bodies over there they're not theophany now you can say well there's a flesh body that's okay I don't care but it ain't that body to eat because they said we don't eat here okay for they are gone in the rapture in the fourth chapter of Revelation so the six dimensions been cleared out so there is no souls under that altar so they're gone therefore this must be a different set of people okay let's go to the next one please so in other words to see this open we must enter into another dimension to see this seal open because what did John see he saw theophanies he was in the spirit realm that okay with that you and I must enter another dimension of thought process if you still think what you're thinking now that's what's got us we're at right now is that okay we must enter another dimension of thought listen I've already said you don't get a revelation in this dimension this dimension is not even so this dimension shouldn't even been here hello it should not it was permitted when time began because life light and matter or time brother Brennan puts in there is what these three dimensions are for that we're called in now they'll come with that and our problem is as we lean toward that and not the spirit realm because truly there are other dimensions and like brother Dale said there's that there's an angel standing right here with me now there's an angel sitting right there with you right now when you get up walk out that door if you're a born-again believer there's an angel with you you're sitting in the car there's an angel with you why that's a spirit realm brother brown said one time he said oh Lord he said break back their eyes so they can see angels satin on the banister setting on the where add the pilaster in other words sitting in other words if what did Elijah do well I just said man Gaza said we're looked because guy hazel was in this 1 2 & 3 dimension God let Elijah being a prophet seeing another dimension and he says there's more force than there are them and haze' goes one two one two fifty thousand twenty thousand fifteen thousand the largest like we got a million angels over here there's a me he said Lord open thy servants eyes and he said what he saw a ring of angels all the way around the camp well hey they're there for me and you if they were there for them they got to be there for us but remember we're not angels and angels are not human we are theophanies we are born again word made flesh this is the theophany of God inside of this guy you're looking at today in the same way without any of you it's the theophany of God down inside of this thing right here it's not an angel I'm not going to an angel they're not going to an angel and he's in the fifth dimension or not angels they're people souls it says souls under the altar so we must then change our thought process entering in another dimension but watch what's what brother Branham had and we'll finish this and be done for this time I'll save a few but let's go to the next quote here's what brother Branham of thought before he went across the curtain of time all right so this is this is a pre-1960 this is 1953 I can't touch brother Neville in there because John saw them they were souls under the altar crying how long now brother Branham is going to the fifth seal John saw them their souls under the altar crying how long Lord how long you know why we went through revelations and how that in there they desire to return and be clothed upon with mortal bodies they were crying how long now they knew each other but they couldn't talk and shake hands or I beg your pardon the Lord stopped him he said I beg your pardon they could talk because they said how long but they couldn't shake hands and so forth and we know that's not true but remember the old thought process that we had playing hearts Casper the Friendly Ghost that can move through the walls and move through you and he would say me and brother never walk by and said we couldn't shake hands because there was nothing there but when we die when we die now we go directly into the presence of Almighty God in a celestial body if I would meet brother Neville up there if I died both died now in an hour from now I'd meet him I say greetings brother Neville talk to him I couldn't show you them now that's the prophets idea that's his revelation he gets an updated revelation a few years later but that's his revelation of what it is because you know what that's the old thought that were spirits floating back and forth I could not shake his hand he's in a celestial body I could talk to him he'd looked just like he does there I'd look like I do but we could talk to one another but we couldn't touch one another because we haven't got any of the five senses of see stay still smelling here Wow hmm Alice he's going to change in about seven years ago God's gonna send him across the curtain time all right there okay so now let's look at the curtains time ghostly just go back up keep going this is where brother Branham explains this is even in 1965 so I wanted to get an updated as as late as I could get not just the 1960 version and it helped me because I used to have an idea when a person died just their soul went off but he Quinn he quoted that to me if they search the tabernacle her habitation beat we already have one see we got to have everything in threes to make perfection seeing there's one body here and that body which is the celestial body then the glorified body in the resurrection see that makes it complete the body here the celestial body in the body and the resurrection that's the three there buddy got that say ma'am all right wake up for just a minute see that makes it complete it's not a myth it's not an idea it's not a spirit it's a man and woman like you are just exactly and then years ago I've seen the regions of the law then was there I tell you friend as an old man let me persuade you this across the nation this morning don't never want to view that place there's no way at all that I could if I was an artist with a brush I couldn't paint the picture as a minister I couldn't describe do you talk about Hell being a burning place it'd be a million times worse than that the horrors that goes with it in heaven or this place wherever it was I don't know what to call it he referred to it there as souls under the altar but when it was I have never there's no way to explain how great it is there is now you just have to take my words I'm just a man but these tell about the vision is always coming too fast keep going now here he is he asked him he says I said do you eat he said not here we don't eat here but when we go back to earth will receive a body we eat in well I could feel them now that's totally contrary to what he was thinking before I could feel them they was just like that see and I said well you have oh yes they have a body just not a myth it's a body we knew we know one another they all knowed me was hugging me millions of them and I said I want to see the one that brought me here says you can't see him you have to wait why did you put me they said you're a leader on earth do you mean all these are Brandan's he said no they're your convert so I looked around then it hard night the trials passed away when I could see their face a young woman run up there and one of the most beautiful women she throws her arms around me said precious brother and when she passed by now she was a woman but in there there's never be sin see our glands were changed there they won't raise children no more there see all the same so what it was in other words when he hugged her he knew she was a woman that's how real that person was that's how real these people are in the fifth dimension but you got to separate the two you can't put on the same they're totally separate because these are given white robes we get our white robe we've already got them own if we're born again you've got the righteousness of God in your soul right now if you're born again you don't go get it in another dimension the only way you're gonna get something in another dimension is is you gonna hope your foolish version you gonna hold a cup of white Saul I hope but if you got it now see we take our robes with us this group gets white ropes that makes the difference of the two these this group of people are not born again this group this group that group he's talking about is alright now let's look at number nine and then we'll close right here and then then we'll start on the we'll get into the specifics of all the where we're going what we're doing now look now this is 1961 this is after this is after he went across the curtain of time but now the steel hadn't broke to show the two differences but he's gonna watch what he's don't say to me and you this is this is this is our prophet talking to this group of people today right here in this room no one else all right so shake yourself if you want if you want to be in enough if you want to sleep in another dimension go ahead but you may miss something when we die our souls will go under the altar of God where I was privileged to see a few morning's ago as you know in the vision where the Bible speaks up our spirits will go to God who give it our body shall return to the dust of the earth but some day with us when the scriptures fulfilled our spirits will be released from God will pick up the soul and the soul to the body and the power that'll raise us up is right in us now we are now in heavenly places we are now in the power of the Resurrection see that's why we got a lap this thing back under here because right here's where the resurrection that's where that power comes made manifest right here's where it's made manifest not over here is made manifest right here it's seen it's got to be in you now to carry you somewhere if there wasn't a law to that sons and daughters of God would create them a world out there and go live a private life it be your own little world some of you do that anyway you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow a shadow of the power of God in you you've got the power to do it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it hallelujah there you are now that's not this group of people okay they're powerless they don't get all the benefits of these but they do get a benefit a great one and a great revelation but the great revelation to me is is it happens we have to go to another dimension to see this thing take place and we're going to find out about that white robe next Sunday and about why they were given to them but we're gonna also see that if it how many times in the fifth seal I'll count them if you read the fifth seal count how many times brother Branham talks about grace go there's no way this has to be the Great Seal of the of the Bible because how in the world can God give eternal life to a group of people that hated him literally hated him said let his blood be on us and our children but God put him in a place so he could break a seal to show you that the real you never did it because if you come to these people right here and if they've got one little speck that God can see he can't give them eternal life they have to be totally wiped clean and white robes had given to him because of what God did now you and I you said boy they're kind of Rascals no you not come under that same thing we were a group of people that didn't want God you didn't come out of the womb crime for God you went and did your thing right I went and did my thing I didn't want nothing to do with God but you know what he had a place called grace he had a place called grace that we could come to that one day that he'll call your name and you answer and then the predestinated that are here we get our white robe here they get their white robes in another dimension they're already dead they're already there their bodies are laying somewhere they've been burnt up they've been shot they've been gassed but someday God's gonna honor what he said he's gonna give them eternal life just for being a Jew and for him blinding their eyes but he blinded their eyes so that you and I could come in let's stand our feet he blinded their eyes so that you and I could come in you and I would have never had an opportunity of salvation if Israel would have accepted Christ the way he was when he came to earth you and I did not have a chance though look what we didn't have a promise we had no promise until the Holy Ghost fell that's the only promise we had all right hey man the Holy Ghost is the only promise would thinkable is the only promise we had and that came after Jesus left so we thank God maybe we'll see now that that what grace really is when we get finished with this sale that it's amazing grave sting God came to us but that he also brother Kern allowed us to see this thing happened see these seals not literally open out there but we see them open what in our room we see them open to us and they become something to me like brother brems said he says the greatest realm he's ever worked in why because all the things he had thought was this way and when those seals open they were that way and what happened God enough grace to God to do this he turned that prophet to where the back side and the front side finally matched and then what he give it to us and what do we do what do we do do we do this no we need to come back and learn that thing have it lined up so we can see what God has for us musicians come you know I'm sorry we got communion today let's bow our heads chamblee father thank you for this day we pray that what we've said Lord has been satisfying to you father I know it sometimes you feel like you're not getting to the people but Lord somebody's getting it I know that I know that we stand here and we we speak what I believe you give us and Lord they will not return void it will accomplish what it set forth to accomplish Lord forgive us of our sins we stand today Lord and taking communion that we're gonna for a few moments here we're going to commune with you Lord I pray that that communion Lord is so close to where we're going to take that communion with you with our glorified bodies where we can eat Lord the ones that are in the sixth dimension are longing to come back because they can't take communion they can't eat while they're where they're at they're not complete the Lord just told us in Hebrews 11 they without us cannot be made perfect so the perfection comes when we stand on this earth and a glorified body that's the Alpha knew that was before the foundation in the world has took over it took over every cell and every fiber of our being and made us in a glorified condition father just give us grace forgive us of our sins Lord as we stand at the communion table we all partake Lord that we'll think about you never forget Calvary the Prophet told us even all the things that even this great seals that we're looking at today brother Branham calls it the book of Redemption and redemption Lord you went to Calvary to pay the price to get us back in the right condition father thank you for that we ask you just bless the ones that are not feeling well Lord ones that are sick that's you at this moment Lord that you would touch them and heal them in the Gentile way the Lord we just believe that you're here we believe what you say in the name of Jesus Christ we ask these things amen let's go to communion okay let's get a print of cloth here y'all go ahead and come up with a communion we'll be ready in just a second
