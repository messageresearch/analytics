[0:07] four
[0:11] verse 7.
[0:14] good to have everybody back
[0:17] that was gone
[0:20] did they have bells that are here here
[0:24] and then now next Sunday I'll be doing
[0:27] this but the next two Sundays
[0:29] you'll make it
[0:33] here a lot of stuff no he's fine well
[0:38] he's got two weeks
[0:42] next Friday when I was flying out
[0:45] give it to yourself where are you going
[0:48] okay going to Kansas I don't know I'm
[0:51] going to Oklahoma
[0:52] one brother Claude we got a they have a
[0:55] Minister's meeting at brother Frank
[0:56] prater's on Saturday so they invited me
[0:58] to come not the three but to come
[1:02] so we're fun you're not gonna say
[1:05] anything
[1:09] well sure I'll say God bless you
[1:11] Brothers
[1:12] but now Clyde's speaking at The
[1:15] Minister's meeting on Saturday and then
[1:16] I'm preaching for him on Sunday
[1:18] then the next weekend we're going to be
[1:20] at Doug Scott so
[1:24] that'll just be a one day trip but the
[1:27] wonderful keeps in Kansas because we
[1:29] always flew into Kansas and drive the
[1:32] clogs but the AirTran doesn't go to
[1:35] Wichita anymore so we had to fly in the
[1:37] Tulsa thanks to Delta Airline and
[1:40] brother Benny you weren't around nowhere
[1:41] but we could find you to get any tickets
[1:43] from you so that's all right but you can
[1:47] see turn the camera and just point to
[1:48] this telephone so we had to get some
[1:52] I've never you know that thing right
[1:54] there never answered the thing I pulled
[1:55] that thing up here and it's nothing
[1:56] happens
[2:01] so we got it from some stranger down in
[2:03] at Delta gave us two tickets don't even
[2:06] know his name Benny said I got six
[2:07] tickets you want two I said yes
[2:09] so anyway
[2:11] so we'll be flying out to Tulsa next
[2:14] Friday not this coming Friday but the
[2:16] next Friday remember our fishing trip
[2:20] um
[2:21] all the brothers need to meet here
[2:23] that's going after second service for a
[2:26] brief meeting okay for a brief meeting
[2:31] immediately I have to take a service yes
[2:34] um also remember my buddy Claude Jr just
[2:38] sent me a text and he is running a very
[2:41] high fever he has a urinary tract
[2:43] infection again and he's heading to the
[2:46] doctor
[2:47] so they couldn't get his temperature
[2:48] down so probably they're not having
[2:50] services this morning so just keep him
[2:52] in your thoughts you don't have to
[2:54] it's called diabetic
[2:57] yes very very much he's been diabetic
[3:00] since he was 14 years old he's 58 years
[3:03] old now so oh wow he's lived a lot
[3:07] longer than they said he would so he was
[3:09] a severe diabetic at 14.
[3:13] no come to find out he went fishing a
[3:17] few days ago the last two days Ginger
[3:19] said and he didn't drink hardly anything
[3:22] so he got a new boat for his birthday so
[3:26] I just got some stuff for her to duty um
[3:30] that's part of that okay that I'll find
[3:34] out the name of it well Martin sent him
[3:36] some colloidal silver but I think he
[3:37] took all that up back when he was sick
[3:39] the first time he got better
[3:41] and then I guess now
[3:44] if you're diabetic and you need detox
[3:47] every night and stuff finishes do a
[3:50] castle okay so I'll get the name of it
[3:54] eating a bottle of before you go okay
[3:57] just remember the people out there they
[3:58] have a hard time because they have no
[4:00] other preacher to preach so nobody close
[4:02] by so
[4:03] I don't know what they're doing for
[4:05] service but just remember them
[4:07] Ephesians 4 verse 7 we're going to take
[4:09] a little different angle
[4:11] because I still I want to get started on
[4:14] faith but I still want us to be
[4:16] established and grounded in like last
[4:18] Sunday we were talking about the order
[4:20] of how brother Branham preached uh our
[4:23] last Wednesday night also the key and
[4:25] then then preached the key was faith and
[4:28] then preached statue of perfect man then
[4:30] preached my guide then he preached damn
[4:32] 70 weeks and then you could see how God
[4:35] was laying that in order well that's the
[4:36] way you and I are going to have to
[4:38] understand
[4:40] Church ages is a doctrinal point of a
[4:43] message right when you pick up a church
[4:45] age book and you you know a lot of
[4:46] people hand the church age books to a
[4:48] new convert or somebody you want to
[4:50] explain the message to you hand them a
[4:52] church age book well in that church age
[4:54] book what it has all the foundational
[4:56] doctrinal points of one God water
[4:59] baptism no eternal hell and all those
[5:01] things and brother Brown breaks that
[5:02] down plus he brings the church ages
[5:05] together and shows how each her takes
[5:06] messenger had a had a a message and then
[5:10] there was a group of people locked away
[5:12] with that message so see there's your
[5:14] foundational and that's what he preached
[5:16] in 6061 and there with any come in 1962
[5:19] he brings statue of a perfect man in he
[5:21] brings Daniel 70 weeks and that's what
[5:23] I'm saying about
[5:25] our understanding our understanding of
[5:28] of should be if brother Brown had to
[5:31] understand it that way then you and I
[5:33] are going to have to not exactly the way
[5:34] he did but we're gonna have to put it in
[5:36] that order
[5:37] because once you put it in an order I
[5:40] see that it's more simple than just
[5:42] everybody won't know what the seals are
[5:44] when you're in sure everybody knows what
[5:46] the letter of the seals are but do you
[5:48] know or have you got the foundational
[5:49] Doctrine down have you got the Daniel 70
[5:53] weeks
[5:55] right and in order if not you're not the
[5:57] seals are not going to open to you
[5:59] okay so you got to go get the
[6:01] foundational Doctrine get that down pat
[6:04] then you got to come up to the key which
[6:06] is Faith then you got to come to Daniel
[6:08] to assess your perfect man showing how
[6:11] to get the man in order Daniel 70 weeks
[6:13] how to line the scriptures up then
[6:17] you can look at the seals as something
[6:19] that is part of your life that that is
[6:22] going to open and be revealed to you and
[6:25] it will show it will manifest itself
[6:26] once you get to that point that's where
[6:30] brother Graham said that was the third
[6:32] pull and it can't be imitated you can
[6:35] imitate
[6:36] how many people do we know been in the
[6:39] message a long time had the foundational
[6:41] doctrines right but it was by letter
[6:43] right
[6:45] you can quote it by letter
[6:49] but if it was a revelation they'd still
[6:50] be here right it was a revelation that
[6:54] still be here but if it was just do's
[6:56] and don'ts God sent a prophet
[7:00] don't cut your hair do cut your hair
[7:03] men you know the vice verses of all this
[7:06] or the the foundational doctrines
[7:08] because watch what happens then you come
[7:11] on up to a little bit further and you
[7:13] start getting into the statue of a
[7:15] perfect man well
[7:17] brother Ramsey some of them start
[7:18] falling off
[7:19] uh We're Not Gonna read it today but I
[7:21] have another quote where brother Brown
[7:22] said we see these scraps he scrap heap
[7:25] of ministers that go out past God's plan
[7:27] and you see them on the side of the road
[7:29] not saying that they're wrong but they
[7:31] just run roll around freaks to a sermon
[7:34] of running without a message and that if
[7:37] you run without a message I mean you're
[7:39] running
[7:40] but you just don't have a message behind
[7:42] it so there's no there's no
[7:45] character there's power there and power
[7:48] without that character power without
[7:50] these virtues
[7:52] you see what they're doing now they're
[7:54] discrediting the message they've been in
[7:55] the message sure they know the
[7:57] foundational document they know to see
[7:59] they're stuck on they're stuck on
[8:01] brother Branham was wrong here and this
[8:03] one's wrong here there and and brother
[8:05] fiscal lied in 1974 and you know crazy
[8:08] stuff like that
[8:12] but we see if it's a revelation then it
[8:15] will carry you and sure we can have a a
[8:18] knowledge of the seal
[8:21] because you can walk in sanctification
[8:23] for years without having the Holy Ghost
[8:25] and all of a sudden one day boom because
[8:27] look what happened you say well give me
[8:29] an example
[8:32] 12 apostle
[8:34] actually 11.
[8:36] because number 12 walked with Jesus all
[8:40] the way through the foundational
[8:42] Doctrine right
[8:46] the devil was there and 11 good ones he
[8:49] was there with him all the way up to
[8:53] the third pool
[8:54] well there was God hanging on the cross
[8:57] Judas couldn't take that Judas turned
[9:00] him down before that but Judas had the
[9:02] foundational adoption Judas had the
[9:04] preaching of the word right
[9:06] casting out Devils signs wonders and all
[9:09] that right right okay same way with a
[9:12] message
[9:12] but now remember Judas was not
[9:15] unconvertible he could be he could have
[9:17] been converted if he would have made
[9:18] that choice but we know he didn't make
[9:19] the choice because God knew it wouldn't
[9:21] make that choice
[9:22] right so but the other 11 did they but
[9:25] they walked in a state of sanctification
[9:27] and had a lot of power
[9:31] but not a lot of character
[9:33] Peter did have a lot of character when
[9:35] he cut the guy's ear off
[9:37] but now about 50 days later
[9:41] right Peter would have never cut that
[9:43] guy's ear off
[9:45] Peter was changed on the day of
[9:47] Pentecost in other words he Jesus was
[9:48] crucified the next day and then 50 days
[9:50] later came the Holy Ghost going down
[9:52] Pentecost so Peter was you know 51 days
[9:55] after that day Peter was the same person
[9:58] and he had the same power but he had
[10:01] character to go along with the power
[10:03] because what happened on the day of
[10:05] Pentecost 120 in the upper room
[10:07] they received these virtues for their
[10:10] time in their fullness when they
[10:13] received the Holy Ghost because God had
[10:15] already taught him just like you and I
[10:16] even though it's like I was trying to
[10:19] say the other Wednesday night and I hope
[10:21] people didn't take it wrong I just I
[10:22] just see that a lot of people were just
[10:25] were parakeets or or something and we
[10:27] just say what brother Dale said or we
[10:29] just say what brother Brown said
[10:30] it's got to be personally revealed to
[10:32] you and you've got to go in the same
[10:34] steps you can't act like a sinner and
[10:37] get the and get the seal
[10:40] so here we got power we got power we got
[10:43] the word
[10:45] we need the character to go with it so
[10:47] that God can say hey you've got the
[10:50] power now you have the ability to handle
[10:53] that power
[10:54] right you if you've got the Holy Ghost
[10:59] you've got the power
[11:01] okay but without character
[11:04] it's a pain but pile with characters
[11:06] Victor rule power with character is
[11:08] something that you take in your everyday
[11:09] life it's like I was saying Wednesday
[11:11] night the seals are on the front side of
[11:13] the book and the back in other words
[11:14] coming and going if you're walking in
[11:16] that direction your life behind you is
[11:18] the same as it is in front of you in
[11:20] other words you act the same in churches
[11:22] you do at work
[11:24] I've always said it it would be
[11:27] it would be funny but it wouldn't be
[11:29] would brother Dale to walk up every
[11:32] person and say bro Bob I'm gonna go
[11:34] spend a week at work with you this week
[11:36] now if he goes into a connection set and
[11:39] falls over with hives and sweats and
[11:43] maybe causing sick that week
[11:45] I know something's going on
[11:47] right yeah but if brother Neil could
[11:50] walk all the way through when you say
[11:52] well brother now well what about God
[11:53] he's there already
[11:57] see he's there already he's there with
[12:00] you during that time that you're doing
[12:01] what you're doing you know I mean uh
[12:04] brother they don't can't be there all
[12:05] the time but this this man can
[12:07] but this right here in the book of
[12:09] Ephesians we see that Paul picked it up
[12:13] Peter showed us what to do and to your
[12:17] faith virtue after getting the divine
[12:18] nature of God then God is going to start
[12:21] adding these virtues but now how are you
[12:23] going to get them
[12:25] I believe Paul brings back into a point
[12:28] in Ephesians 4
[12:31] and he says look verse 7 but unto every
[12:34] one of us
[12:37] all right the divine nature of God
[12:40] remember Peter says having the divine
[12:42] nature of God you
[12:43] you've escaped the Crux into the world
[12:45] through lust all right well now watch
[12:47] what Paul's doing Paul's picking it up
[12:49] and telling you how to do it all right
[12:52] you got it but unto every one of us is
[12:55] given Grace according to the measure of
[13:00] the gift of Christ now that means that
[13:01] everybody has a measure
[13:05] right everybody has a measure
[13:09] of gifts
[13:10] this thing's not on again
[13:14] a measure
[13:16] of the guest man I love watch him
[13:19] wherefore you stay at when the when he
[13:22] ascended up on high he led captivity
[13:24] captive and gave gifts plural
[13:27] yes on demand
[13:30] now that he ascended what is it but that
[13:33] he also descended first into the more
[13:35] parts of the Earth
[13:37] in other words he went to hell remember
[13:39] Priests of the stolen prison he that
[13:41] descended is the same also that I said
[13:43] it far above all Heavens that he might
[13:45] fill all things and he gave some
[13:48] Apostles he says how are you going to
[13:50] get this because when he says afterwards
[13:52] and he gave some Apostles and some
[13:54] Prophet some evangelists and some
[13:57] pastors and teachers for what
[14:00] for the perfecting of the Saints
[14:03] for the work of the ministry for the
[14:06] edifying of the body of Christ
[14:09] teal
[14:12] teal
[14:14] that's how long
[14:16] and it's up to you how long
[14:20] that teal is yours
[14:23] you know we're going to wait until that
[14:25] word tell is until
[14:28] I get ready to go
[14:30] I'm not gonna go right so kill
[14:34] we all
[14:37] do you not leaving one out till we all
[14:40] come into the unity of the faith
[14:42] same Doctrine
[14:45] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[14:47] unto a perfect man
[14:50] until you're working towards something
[14:52] all right unto the measure
[14:55] of the stature not statue stature is
[14:58] height or growth development all right
[15:00] of the fullness of Christ
[15:03] that we hint forth
[15:06] now henceforth
[15:09] in other words something happened
[15:12] and it's not going to happen anymore
[15:13] henceforth
[15:16] in other words when we all come to the
[15:18] unity of Faith all Heaven Knows the Son
[15:20] of God unto the perfect man to the
[15:22] measure the statue that we hint for
[15:25] be no more children in other words you
[15:27] won't be children if God gives you these
[15:28] gifts Faith versions based okay Faith
[15:31] you are baby but Merchant only
[15:33] temporation God is another kindness you
[15:34] have these things working in your life
[15:35] you're not a baby
[15:37] you come to a stature or a growth
[15:39] development
[15:41] because look here's where I catch my my
[15:44] wording on people in the message and
[15:47] they go up through the foundational
[15:48] doctrinal points and oh they can even
[15:50] preach them and go on but watch into the
[15:52] statue of a perfect man because watch
[15:53] what he says then we hence forth be no
[15:56] more children toss two and fro thank you
[16:01] there it is right there
[16:03] toss to and fro and carried about
[16:07] with every wind of Doctrine by the slide
[16:10] of man and cunning craftiness whereby
[16:14] they lie and wait to see
[16:17] right there is where they fall off if
[16:19] they don't have
[16:21] the new birth
[16:23] if they don't have the faith in the
[16:24] message that they're preaching or
[16:26] walking or doing right there's where
[16:28] you're going to fall off all right let
[16:30] me read that one more time that we hence
[16:32] forth be no more children
[16:35] Paul's compelling us milk is good
[16:39] strong meat is good too all right that
[16:42] we in for it be no more children
[16:45] costume and fro don't know who this
[16:47] doctor's right I don't know whether this
[16:49] one line or I don't know where the
[16:51] distance got the truth or I don't know
[16:52] where I don't know what I need to come
[16:54] church today or not God's just not going
[16:56] to be there I'll just sit right here and
[16:57] you understand what I'm saying are the
[17:00] carriers of Life remember
[17:03] the store the seed
[17:05] the seeds the children of the Kingdom
[17:08] that wasn't centers that was sold that
[17:10] was
[17:13] Children of the Kingdom and the Bible
[17:17] said the cares of Life
[17:19] choked them didn't make them not a son
[17:22] it choked their development
[17:24] they didn't come to maturity because
[17:26] remember God was pleased with those two
[17:29] little ships that come out of the ground
[17:30] now that wasn't a bit of corn there's no
[17:31] way you could Harvest that corn
[17:34] right but Luther come up out of that
[17:36] ground with two shoes that dog was just
[17:39] as pleased with that because that
[17:40] started something well that's the same
[17:41] way with you and I when you start eating
[17:44] a new birth you're just too little
[17:45] tender young cute all right then you
[17:49] come up out of that and grow into
[17:51] maturity
[17:52] but look how what happened toss two and
[17:55] fro and carried about with every wind of
[17:57] Doctrine by the slide of men
[18:00] so it's not just one man it's men
[18:02] and cunning crafting this whereby they
[18:05] lie and wait to deceive
[18:07] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[18:10] up
[18:13] there's your growth to grow up
[18:16] into him in All Things
[18:20] which is the head of the church even
[18:22] Christ from whom the whole body Bentley
[18:24] joined together
[18:26] and compacted
[18:29] all right
[18:30] everybody got the compacted part the
[18:33] compacted part
[18:34] if we'll read we'll probably get to it
[18:37] today
[18:40] but remember what we were preaching
[18:41] Wednesday about the
[18:43] not the two Holy Ghost but the two the
[18:45] difference in getting the holy ghost at
[18:46] the bottom of the pyramid in the top of
[18:48] the pyramid all right here's where it's
[18:50] compacted
[18:53] brother Brown says the Holy Ghost
[18:58] seals these virtues in what is compacted
[19:01] you take compacted dirt you can't dig it
[19:05] because wine it's Bentley joined it's
[19:07] pressed together everything's where it's
[19:09] supposed to be you can't move it you
[19:11] know water can't uh water can't move it
[19:14] and water can move loose soil uh that's
[19:17] why you don't build your house on sand
[19:19] is very movable all right but now
[19:23] talking about this right here it's not
[19:26] but now look who he's talking to
[19:29] he's talking to the Ephesians who are
[19:31] immature group of church very strong
[19:33] Church
[19:35] very powerful Church
[19:38] not even as many sitting in his room
[19:40] today
[19:41] there's 20 something of you sitting here
[19:43] today and they had 12. and they were a
[19:46] mighty powerful Church why they all had
[19:47] the Holy Ghost you all had gifts working
[19:48] in their life they all had to uh Power
[19:51] with character all right so that's what
[19:54] we're looking at if 12 can have that
[19:56] much power and turn the world upside
[19:57] down look what we as 20 something people
[19:59] sitting here should be able to do if we
[20:02] come to a full mature stature of God all
[20:05] right from whom the whole body Bentley
[20:07] joined together and compacted because
[20:10] see you're in the body at Faith right
[20:12] right the divine nature you're in the
[20:15] body of faith
[20:16] but he wants that thing to be sealed so
[20:18] together joints and everything Maryland
[20:21] everything to be working as a unit
[20:25] from him the whole body feeling joined
[20:27] together and compacted
[20:29] by that whichever joint supplies
[20:33] not cutting it off not cutting somebody
[20:35] out no everything working together in
[20:38] unity according to the effectual working
[20:42] see and the measure of every part
[20:47] make it I like that word makeup you do
[20:50] these things remember and if we'll be
[20:52] reading for second Peter if you do these
[20:55] things they make you
[20:56] that you'll be established in the
[20:58] knowledge of God right they'll make you
[21:00] they'll literally transform you that's
[21:03] what you want you want something because
[21:04] you know what
[21:06] the creatures of habit
[21:09] human beings we have to be made to do so
[21:13] why do you think that Bell had to go off
[21:17] to make people go upstairs where they
[21:20] should have already went
[21:23] but but it's human I mean
[21:26] look outside we got speed limits
[21:29] we're all governed by somebody making
[21:32] you do something whether you think
[21:33] you're a free country or not you go try
[21:36] to get a permit to build a building
[21:37] outside of your house and it don't
[21:39] conform to the code of that of that area
[21:41] you know what they're going to tell you
[21:43] no you can't do that
[21:45] or you got to build it a certain way
[21:46] well if they make you do that for a
[21:49] certain reason well the Bible
[21:51] I know it's all by grace and it's all by
[21:54] love but love look how many times the
[21:56] Bible says make it will make you what
[21:59] it's doing is giving you a promise that
[22:01] if you'll do this it will make you
[22:03] conform to this all right and you won't
[22:05] have as much of that to and fro and and
[22:08] am I right and am I wrong and and all
[22:11] that just do the simple thing this if
[22:13] you do the simple thing
[22:16] God promised if we never fall according
[22:19] to the eventual working in the measure
[22:21] of every part
[22:22] don't be a don't don't think you're a a
[22:26] heart when you're a pinky
[22:30] that's why you got to find your place
[22:33] we got all these people that that they
[22:36] they come in a message and 20 something
[22:37] years old and like Daddy said they'll
[22:39] read one book and they want to be a
[22:40] preacher
[22:42] if I was a minister or a pastor in that
[22:45] church
[22:46] I would absolutely grill that child
[22:50] in a lot of things before I'd let that
[22:52] child ever do any of that and I said
[22:54] child
[22:56] because you see a lot of young kids out
[22:58] here just preaching and all they got to
[23:00] fire but they don't have a whole lot of
[23:02] wisdom and they don't have a whole lot
[23:03] to say as far as that but
[23:06] just like this here it says some
[23:08] apostles
[23:10] so if you if you find out you're an
[23:11] apostle stay in that group
[23:14] Pastor stay in that group evangelist
[23:17] stay in that group look brother Brown
[23:19] says when we know who we are and what
[23:22] we're doing here right what if I know
[23:25] I'm a pinky can I listen everybody wants
[23:29] to be the heart everybody wants to be
[23:30] the brain
[23:32] most everybody wants to be the mouse
[23:39] but there is this little thing right
[23:41] here and you know what the other day
[23:42] just for a carnal illustration my two
[23:45] fingers right here were too fat to fit
[23:47] in a little hole to get something I
[23:48] stuck my old Pinky in there and pulled
[23:50] it right out all right
[23:52] well that was important if I didn't have
[23:54] that little pinky Brother Ray I'd have
[23:56] one got a screwdriver but God gave this
[23:59] to be used
[24:01] you couldn't pinky swear without one of
[24:03] these
[24:05] you understand what I'm saying though
[24:07] yes but if you are if you are like like
[24:11] take for example sister Gabby she's here
[24:13] and she's got her children part of them
[24:15] well she got all three of them
[24:18] one two three
[24:21] I know where the other one is got four
[24:24] most of the time
[24:27] right right yeah
[24:29] you know if if her position is to
[24:33] be the mother of those three children
[24:35] raise them in the ablation of God and
[24:37] and I love her to death because because
[24:40] she's solid in what she believes but you
[24:42] know what she don't have to go out here
[24:44] and tell everybody
[24:46] you don't have to come in every Sunday
[24:47] and tell him no
[24:49] and you know what if that's the position
[24:51] that God
[24:52] put her in and she feels safe and able
[24:56] to work in that position she's just as
[24:58] much of a witness
[25:00] she's just as much as a
[25:03] preacher
[25:05] more than so if she stays where she is
[25:08] and if I'm in my own place
[25:11] more so
[25:13] than her being her place gosh more
[25:15] please than for me saying well I'm gonna
[25:17] start evangelizing I'm gonna be in
[25:19] evangelist I'm gonna quit teaching I'm
[25:20] gonna be in abandoned I'm gonna go out
[25:21] and just tear the world apart yeah you
[25:24] might go out there about three or four
[25:25] weeks but then you won't be there no
[25:26] more
[25:29] so find out your position
[25:31] have you ever asked
[25:34] what am I doing in this church
[25:36] well what am I doing in my community why
[25:38] did God move me over here why did I do
[25:41] this or that or the other have you ever
[25:42] asked him that
[25:43] oh
[25:44] you need to ask him that sometime
[25:46] you know
[25:49] and for those of you on the internet
[25:51] there with both children
[25:55] yeah I I was not I always wondered where
[25:59] where you were supposed to put the
[26:01] emphasis on the sentence that says he
[26:05] gave some a process should you put it on
[26:08] some he gave some Apostles some profits
[26:11] or some people having a
[26:14] some people
[26:16] that's right
[26:18] but now remember
[26:20] like I told you it's got to work like a
[26:22] unit
[26:23] like five fingers that's a five-fold
[26:26] minutes he's got five fingers all right
[26:28] but now sometimes my thumb
[26:30] is more important than my pointing
[26:33] finger right
[26:35] so sometimes
[26:38] this is what I need
[26:40] sometimes this is what I need
[26:43] I hope I never use that much the world
[26:46] likes to use that one
[26:48] but this one and this one you understand
[26:50] some
[26:51] how many of you enjoy teaching we all
[26:53] enjoy teaching minutes because that's
[26:55] that's what we're we've been grown under
[26:58] but now what if you had an evangelist
[27:00] every single Sunday
[27:04] that's where he gave some
[27:07] you'd move right
[27:09] here hey look nothing on the internet
[27:12] again nothing against evangelist at all
[27:15] that's right they have their place
[27:18] absolutely they have their place brother
[27:20] Brown said evangelist comes in stirs the
[27:22] people up gives them the word and leaves
[27:24] right then the pastor comes along and
[27:28] takes that word maybe and I'm talking
[27:29] about maybe just one word
[27:31] that Sparks in your heart
[27:34] God puts it in brother Dale's heart to
[27:37] expound 30 sermons on it right right
[27:39] that's right and that's what we're doing
[27:41] when he gave some he gave something you
[27:43] couldn't stand Apostles all the time
[27:46] you couldn't stand prophets all the time
[27:48] right right it's not that you can't
[27:50] stand it's just we all have individual
[27:52] individual needs and wants we need an
[27:56] evangelist maybe once a month or once
[27:58] every two months come in stir the gift
[28:00] up and then leave
[28:02] do it no it's not a plan there's no way
[28:06] an evangelist
[28:07] wow should be a faster
[28:10] because it's a gift it's a different
[28:12] gift look look where the Bible says look
[28:16] he gave some apostle
[28:20] right
[28:21] and some profits
[28:24] separated
[28:26] and some what evangelists
[28:30] when I look down at the bottom
[28:32] he didn't say some pastors and some
[28:35] teachers they said some pastors and
[28:37] teachers
[28:38] puts the two together
[28:40] because if you'll read over here
[28:42] somewhere else in the in the Bible
[28:45] it only lists like four
[28:47] somewhere in the but it puts the two
[28:49] together because because really actually
[28:51] a pastor can fulfill all five gifts
[28:54] at once at a certain time
[28:57] but he don't need to do it all the time
[29:00] okay
[29:01] on the PCS indeed in the church he'll be
[29:03] in evangelist maybe one service okay
[29:05] somebody comes in with you know
[29:08] acting up or whatever
[29:10] but but because the pastor has to be the
[29:12] one that's there every day every hour
[29:15] every day and he can teach
[29:17] because you got the pastor and teachers
[29:20] together all right
[29:22] because honestly a prophet is not made
[29:26] to be every Sunday get up in the same
[29:28] group of people
[29:30] the people couldn't handle it
[29:33] because he'd have a discernment or he'd
[29:35] have this or or he would be something
[29:37] that would that would um scare you to
[29:40] death I guess sometimes he's needed
[29:42] somewhere else too absolutely because
[29:44] you got to understand
[29:46] these people are not five preachers in
[29:49] one church right you can have five of
[29:52] these preachers in one church but that
[29:54] abandons this kind of evangelize in the
[29:56] same church he's not an evangelist then
[29:58] evangelist means to go out an apostle
[30:01] means to go overseas you know a prophet
[30:03] means to come in have a word for the
[30:05] people call out the sin of the people
[30:07] individually or as a group and then move
[30:10] on but now pastor and a teacher can stay
[30:13] there
[30:16] see that's why honestly they when we're
[30:18] getting off but let's just fill our time
[30:21] up with this because this is what's
[30:22] going to do this and you've got to
[30:24] understand what you need
[30:27] you gotta understand what you need and
[30:30] Paul's telling us we need all five of
[30:31] them for the perfecting of the same so
[30:35] that's this is the perfecting of the
[30:37] Saints statue of a perfect
[30:40] man right but you take the gifts that
[30:44] God's given us you give us a fine full
[30:46] ministry and he give us all these things
[30:49] but you take a
[30:50] a prophet would be one that would that
[30:52] would
[30:54] you know hear straight from God come out
[30:57] bring a message
[30:58] then go somewhere else
[31:00] uh you don't see too many of those
[31:03] you see some that fulfills that office a
[31:06] little bit but if you stay in that
[31:07] office
[31:08] you've got to be going
[31:10] it's like dad's always said with a
[31:13] five-fold Ministry in the economy of God
[31:15] if you take a five-fold Ministry and do
[31:17] it the way it's supposed to be done
[31:19] you can send evangelist out and he ain't
[31:22] gonna live enough
[31:24] a shack and make 200 a week
[31:27] right
[31:29] what's happening is we got pastors that
[31:31] go out and preach a lot
[31:34] and that takes the part of the
[31:36] Evangelist because the evangelists
[31:38] listen when that's why under bands looks
[31:42] like brother Joel could you imagine I
[31:44] mean I preach maybe a
[31:47] four or five places a year
[31:49] sometimes multiple places
[31:52] but could you imagine bro Joe Forney
[31:54] told me he preached it 88 different
[31:56] churches in one year
[31:59] 88 different churches now there's only
[32:02] 52 weeks in a year
[32:04] if you just preached on Sunday that's
[32:06] just 52.
[32:07] every Wednesday's 52 he's got the same
[32:10] thing the 88
[32:14] different places if he'd come here like
[32:17] two times a year but 88 different places
[32:19] in one year you know why
[32:21] sure he was on he was in demand
[32:24] but you can't just go preach on Sunday
[32:27] and make a living
[32:29] I mean Jewel makes a living just off of
[32:32] what the people pay
[32:33] okay I don't know if both him give them
[32:36] any or not and that's none of my
[32:37] business
[32:38] but some people will evangelize out of a
[32:40] church and they'll give him a little bit
[32:42] of a salary to kind of Hell by but you
[32:44] take an evangelist that comes in here
[32:45] and into pure evangelist he lived off
[32:47] what you give him
[32:50] and let me tell you something
[32:54] I don't see how they make it
[32:58] I mean you go to church and preach and
[33:00] they give you a hundred dollars and it
[33:02] cost you about 200 to get there
[33:04] right figure that out you need a bigger
[33:07] watermelon truck you can't make it
[33:10] enough
[33:11] and I know it's not all about money
[33:13] but what's happening is pastors
[33:16] are evangelizing and taking that part
[33:19] out of the money in the evangelists and
[33:20] also when evangelist comes they don't
[33:22] have enough to pay them because they
[33:23] don't keep up with their own ties so
[33:24] that they can pay them to a minister
[33:29] but but that's neither here nor there we
[33:31] I believe we do it right here at this
[33:33] church so I believe we can we can handle
[33:35] that but
[33:37] I'm sure if Jewel said that he went to
[33:39] one place and they gave him like I wrote
[33:41] him a check for eighty dollars and it
[33:42] bounced
[33:44] the brother asked him about a month
[33:46] later if he'd come preach for him
[33:49] he said well brother you need to make up
[33:51] this bad check oh I'll make it up you
[33:54] come back preach and I'll write you
[33:55] another one
[34:00] y'all didn't go back
[34:02] but you see you want to talk about that
[34:04] you're going to get perfected though
[34:06] when an evangelist can't evangelize this
[34:09] is my point when an evangelist came
[34:11] evangelize he's got to go get a job and
[34:12] it ain't bad to get a job but if you're
[34:14] evangelized if you're an evangelist you
[34:16] need to be out there in the field in a
[34:18] different places preaching
[34:19] that's just the one on evangelist there
[34:21] yeah all right an apostle one cent okay
[34:26] you send one to you send one to you send
[34:29] one you're sending them across the world
[34:31] or wherever and
[34:36] I don't see why in the world that they
[34:38] don't have an apostle that would
[34:41] that would stay in a place for a while
[34:43] because an apostle is one cent over to a
[34:46] place
[34:48] not just to evangelize
[34:51] he sent there to help the people grow up
[34:53] but then you got the teacher well here's
[34:55] the teacher nobody wants a teacher
[34:56] except your own home church
[34:58] and not saying that because I'm a
[35:01] teacher but I can see it in many places
[35:02] you go to place and preach and and the
[35:04] people just absolutely just crowd around
[35:06] you like your uh uh you know like you're
[35:08] a rock star Jim said it many times but
[35:10] the pastor don't ever ask you back you
[35:12] know why
[35:14] a little bit on jealous side well you
[35:17] know what's he doing but what's she
[35:18] doing though
[35:19] he's killing his people
[35:22] that's the point I'm trying to say he's
[35:24] killing his people
[35:26] starving them to death malnourished good
[35:29] Christian
[35:30] sitting in the church hearing nothing
[35:32] but evangelists and then you know this
[35:34] and then hear that but you never hear a
[35:36] teacher the teacher does more of showing
[35:39] you where you are with God because
[35:41] that's what the teaching and the
[35:43] preaching and teaching that I hear is
[35:45] that it shows me where I'm at and what
[35:47] I'm lacking
[35:49] with God so
[35:51] that's how we're to be perfected
[35:54] is to and I'm not thrown off on any
[35:58] Pastor some pastors can't afford because
[36:00] they got little beef Roots but I'd find
[36:02] a way to get my people to have an
[36:04] evangelist somehow some way and you know
[36:07] what God said he'd make a way because
[36:09] you can't get perfected without all five
[36:11] all right so God Will Make A Way that's
[36:13] where you got to rely on God and say God
[36:15] you're the one who's going to do it
[36:16] bring that guy in
[36:18] and we'll give them to our people but
[36:21] here we don't have that problem but I
[36:23] see people starving to death well how do
[36:25] you think they're going to make this
[36:25] statue a perfect man
[36:27] how do you think the Saints are going to
[36:29] be perfected
[36:31] if they don't have all five folds and
[36:33] not just all five in one person
[36:36] can't do that
[36:37] you gotta have a five-fold Ministry all
[36:39] right just think about that until next
[36:40] Sunday and then we're gonna we're going
[36:42] to start with face
[36:48] is the key
[36:53] foreign
