Aaron will be preaching this coming uh Wednesday Saturday will be the fellowship meeting in Alabama if you want to go with us we're leaving at 11:00 make sure you let us know um Wai and Brother Dean are out preaching today and traveling back home remember them uh Bible study April the 5th brother CLA will be with us on April the 6th Easter Gathering will be April the 12th the uh fellowship meeting will be May the 17th here brother Ernie villan NOA will be with us the Lord willing so remember these uh Brother Anderson said that they was going to be leaving a little early today go to take Mom back to the airport we enjoyed her being here with us and PR the Lord will will be with her as she travels and then she'll be back the Lord willing uh in April we enjoyed having you there here with us Amen in Matthew 13 and then Luke 1 let's just pray are we that all the meetings we got tried to give them an order where we'd remember Heavenly Father we thank you for this day in your grace and love we know and realize without you there wouldn't be nothing here anyway you created all things and everything is for your being and your point that you desire for us to be is what we want to be and we ask you to just help us guide us now forgive our sins cleanse us and guide us and as we speak about you Lord you come on the scene and you manifest yourself through what we're trying to speak about and just have your way we love you Lord thank you for everything just bless all the sick among us we know that you are the Healer and Lord we need you to come and speak to us about the sicknesses and the things and to heal each one Lord you promised it so we believe it you said that you sent your word and healed us father we know you sent your word so now the healing has got to be there in the virture to follow have your way with us now as we read your word you come and speak to us in Jesus name amen so we'll go to Matthew 1336 remember you go back over um in the beginning of Matthew and it'll be the uh the second mystery then this is the mystery explained so it's reason we're going that way then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the terrs of the field he answered and said unto them he that sth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tires are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels and therefore the tires are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity now notice the angels from the son of man will what gather out of his kingdom you're going to they're going to drive them out of it uh you know and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the son in the Kingdom of their father who hath an ear to hear Let Him hear now let's go over to Luke and just read the one we were reading this morning the one verse 24 Luke 21:24 they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captivity into all nations and we know that happened back under you know woe unto them that are with child and Gil suck and all that was back there and and Titus coming forth in ad70 and surrounding Jerusalem and then what and Jerusalem shall be troden down of the Gentiles until the time of the Gentiles be finished you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now not to back up a lot but for those who maybe won't hear uh this morning to make sure that they know kind of what we're talking about and to get our minds into the right channel because that's what we want uh we're talking about this morning and we'll keep the same title this afternoon we'll stay with the title of dispensations and uh we read here in Luke that it says in the time of the Gentiles the prophet used it and said in the dispensation of the Gentiles so then that was my point was trying to get us to this morning to look at it that dispensation deals with a time wise that we're looking at or you know what's taking place in in the day and uh dispensation more or less refers to like a stewardships or something like that is the natural word or even pulling from the Greek and it doesn't give I believe the true meaning of what we need to see but I you know I'm not trying trying to change anything I'm trying to speak of what is there in the word that it is the time of the Gentiles the dispensation or the times and I'm trying to get our point to looking at times and not looking at something that what would not fit together with all of the word of God and uh that way see it's all got to fit because the Bible can't as I said this morning you can't see if you say well brother brand said uh we had a dispensation of the Old Testament dispensation of the new dispensation of the law dispensation of Grace and uh that's true we believe that but remember he goes on to say then I'm not much on a dispensationalist after he'd said he was well if you asked me today you'd say brother Dale are you a dispensation I said yeah according to my understanding of dispensations but maybe according to a lot of people's understanding of that I would not be one because I believe it's the same God in the Old Testament is revealed in the New Testament all right it's not two different gods it's the same God all right you'd say well now if the Old Testament reveals one dispensation and you say well that's a dispensation of a father and you know that being one God and then the New Testament being a dispensation of the sun it being a different God then I'm not not a dispensationalist either I believe that's the former idea of the point that he was saying when he said I'm not on that but he went on to say the quotes I gave you the three he said the Gentile dispensation right in the same quote Parts you know so my point is uh I believe in one true and living God revealed throughout the entire word of God all right now I believe that the revealing of God was not complete now take my wording and listen or finished even in Jesus Christ and even though he was the fullness of the godhead bodily all right and he was the son of man amen but that was not the completion of it right all right because there is a bride to be revealed that's right and the prophet said she's part of the mystery that's right and must be revealed all right now I believe that's Christ of Myster I'll get back to those points later but see I believe that it's the same God being revealed all the way through and I believe like in the ages then that it's uh not him revealing himself in one age is something and the other age is something else the ages is the revealing of God to us of the part that was not made known back there in human flesh as he was walking the Earth he was the fullness of the godhead bodily yeah but we had to be in him all right so we're not something added that would be a dispensation like mankind is looking at as something here and something here different no we are not anything different we are him made manifest in a many membered body whereas it was once in one body see now we are the body of God upon the Earth and he's revealing himself in the way that is to be done all right we'll cover in a little bit that down through the church ages he was revealing himself as Son of God Amen all right then in the end time he'd be revealing himself as son of man all right now I want you to watch this real careful in a minute I'll say it and then repeat it cuz I want you to follow the line and I remember in my early years of studying it and uh we had an old battery ped tape player uh for the 7 Minutes real recorder you know thing that we we carried to work and back and we'd listen to R around preaching as we'd go to work you know and coming back and we would uh it was a battery pirate and we didn't all those have hookups in the car you know so in the old days so we'd have to uh run batteries and I have sat there because itd have enough battery to keep the voice I've sat there with a pencil and actually turned the thing halfway home cuz I was that interested in hearing you know I turn it myself make it go and the rest of it you know because I wanted to hear and I remember we we hit something I've mentioned this before to you but we were playing and we'd always just choose you know like I choose one day brother Mo would one day brother Holland one brother LS and for some reason one week we never any of us chose but one tape we had the unveiling of God and uh so we played that for 5 days you know it just went that way we just didn't bring another one well you know about the fourth day I really caught what he was saying and uh you know it it really dawned on me the point that he was making and it cleared up the Scriptures it cleared up a lot of things uh to me as to my understanding of the one true and living God now we'll read this in a minute so then we'll go back through it but see he's revealed as three sons name right son of man Son of God Son of David all right but see if you don't see it in the correct order look what you'd be going and then when we would cover that son of man man was there Prophet dying giving his life come forth Son of God in the ages then you'd be looking at the next thing to be would be son of David you'd be totally out of the scriptures that's right you know even though you're quoting identically because there's only three sons names the Son of God or son of man Son of God Son of David all right but you got a little key in there that you got to understand and we'll read it in a minute but see then it just clicked when he said it one day see then he son of man Prophet God himself in human flesh come to die died son of man Rose Son of God come forth the church ages Son of God in the end time he comes back as son of man and then he'll go to to Israel as son of David right and see then the scriptures beautifully fit the things that he was trying to explain begin to unfold as it did then that's where I preached that the bride would be there in 1969 that the bride would be the son of man in the last days all right and uh because you think about it look how you would mess up your scriptures son of man his Prophet as we'll review these in a minute cuz I want you to let him say it I'm saying it and getting your thought in your mind that he was son of man and he died it was prophet son of man cuz you couldn't kill Son of God there was no way see that that the Son of God at Calvary had to exit out of the body or the spirit of God the very life of God had to exit out of the body all right then on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost could come back the and be son of God Through the Ages but if you went right straight on the son of David how are you going to get there you can't go and I thought how many of us has missed that and knowing this all these years and tried my best to preach it unto you you know it surely gets more interesting every day you can't go from Son of God to son of David that's right you got to come back to a human element wise you know you got to come back to that son of man so I'm saying this if you miss the message you know at least what I'm trying to say it's got to be then that Luke 17:30 would come into line and and it would be falling into place and see then once he comes in fully into bride and son of man he can go right on to Israel that's right amen but you know what he'll start off to Israel son of God right New Birth or what you want to call it for them not in the Kingdom but eternal life you don't have to die again to give it to them but he'll give them the Holy Ghost then they'll see through those two prophets the son of man right and then they will see and realize that he is now son of David to them that's right all right we'll read a quote here in just a minute where brother R said he's the son of David to us now I love them little things it's laid in there and then it makes me Ponder consider what is being said you know cuz you see he's revealed to you and I as son of man Son of God and Son of David amen he reveals himself to his bride while she's here living all the manifestations that he'll ever be to anyone is made known to her yes sir so he's the son of David in my Revelation but yet he's the son of man yet he's the son of God CU it's the same God that's right and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ all right so if you miss the message now you'll know that's what I'm talking about so we'll let him let him do the reading all right now watch as we go through it and watch watch this to point that we were talking about dispensations because then he's going to be the dispensation of the son of man and we'll let the prophet read it to you that where he say he he couldn't be the Son of God now that don't mean he's not Son of God he was born son of God right right and there's a quote in there where the Prophet you know because he he just time after time he says that he never revealed himself as Son of God see he never called himself Son of God he never referred to himself as Son of God that he referred to himself as son of man but see he was born the Son of God because that's God in human flesh and he growed in Grace and knowledge because he was born Emmanuel but then he never mentioned son of man until he enters his ministry then he begins to talk about son of man and isn't it odd how that as I've always said to you that none of the scholars caught it Scofield's got some good points about it even Paul Peter and them didn't write about son of man but then when brother R starts out in his ministry just immediately when he enters his ministry as to preaching he starts talking about the son of man that's no coincidence to me that's exactly what it's supposed to be all right now we've quoted this many times to you the prophet of God said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for he said Satan will be powerless before her do you think Satan could handle or could now let me quote it and get it straight where brother R said none of us is a match for the devil no no no Luther wasn't a match for the devil no way but yet when God revealed that just shall live by faith Satan would know match for that message they came forth in Martin Luther they said Martin Luther don't you know the world is against you he said I want them to know that I'm against them see nothing could tackle that message they could pick on the man and look what they're doing now nobody can tackle this message or the hour that has been given unto us but look what even inward ranks are coming forth and now they would not have Dar said a word while he was alive but now they're running forth with their own messages well you know what I believe they're doing they're running without a message because they run out of this message into their own all right but think about it now and just watch the point and remember when we read it that he never referred to himself as son of man because that was not his office at the time that was not his dispensational of revealing himself and then he even goes to Peter you know who do Man say I the son of man am and Peter said thou aren't the Christ the son of the Living God he never said Peter now hold it hold hold it I'm not the Son of God now let me tell you I'm going straighten you out you know no no cuz he knew that's all they could handle so he said Peter you didn't answer my question cuz you don't understand son of man but said you got the right point that I'm the Son of God and upon that Revelation I'll build my church on the revelation of Son of God but said in the end time I'm going to come back in the day when the son of man is to be revealed you know all right think on these things see then that way I'm not a dispensationalist to believe in changing of gods or changing of and I believe every Church age there was God made manifest for the age they were in that's right all right but I believe he puts it all in the end and not giving us anything any different because I believe what Luther taught I believe what Wesley taught I believe the truth of what they taught I believe what the Baptist taught the Presbyterian taught the Pentecostals taught I believe the truth of it because it's part of God's word all right and see that way I'm not rejecting anything I'm not an isolationist or what you'd call it or you're just a a brandom no if anything I guess we Lula ites we just that's what I believe that we're trying to be what God wants us to be for the hour we're in okay now watch as he begins to as it begins to unfold and and you'll see the pattern coming down and the dispensations will fall into place or the times or the revealing will fall into the place to where we can see it so go ahead brother Joe I guess who's back our da Bob and Joe I guess other day I was looking around I I said they must have this thing on automatic all right look what he says I wish you would listen to the unveiling of God the Mighty God unveiled especially those two messages and study them and then like I said you'll see there's words in there that'll if you'll really study what he's saying and then when you do you'll see something and it'll just open up the beautiful picture of the Plan of Redemption from God all right now watch he came in three names three sons name he came in the son name of the son of of man the son of David and the Son of God now he didn't put in order but yet we know the order because he puts you know the messages he put them in order then he explains it now now he came first in the son of he started to say David and or whatever cuz they put the point there he said Son of Man so he came first as son of man because he was a prophet now Jehovah himself called Ezekiel and the prophets son of man what see us thou you know son of man man Jesus never referred to himself as Son of God he referred to himself as son of man because the scriptures cannot be broken right now look how specific a prophet with no education could talk it baffles me cuz maybe you don't follow it the way I do and I maybe that's good that you don't but look he never referred to himself as Son of God he never referred to himself as Son of God he didn't say that didn't right that he was the son of God look how perfect maybe you don't follow scripture like that I mean those things mean great to me the Bible could call him a Son of God when he was born the Bible can put him in the lineage and call him a Son of God right we says he see Jesus never referred to himself as Son of God how perfect the being it is he referred to himself as son of man because his scriptures cannot be broken all right going to the next that was paragraph 60 this is paragraph 68 same message unveiling of god notice he came first as the prophet and they crucified him his own crucified him he came as the son of man then after the Holy Spirit came he was then the Son of God God is a spirit he was the Holy Spirit Son of God he lived through the church ages as Son of God watch you now in the Millennium he' be son of David sitting on the throne of his father David he is the son of David now he is to you and I and he is the son of David he just wouldn't making itself manifest to them he was the son of David but you know he didn't change Gods he was the same God what I tried with all this about dispensation to get you to look at it there he stood Son of God Son of Man son of David standing on Earth that's right that's right but he was not making himself known in that way right he was making himself known as son of man because you can't kill God which would be the Son of God and you certainly can't kill the son of David so he had to come as a human man to release that life that was within him right that's why he's called son of man see watch it but look at the point this is what caught me at listening see he's the son of David's sitting upon the throne of his father and remember between the Son of God and he just kind of stops in the lady you see an age they put him out who and be real careful with me they rejected this message and Le Yia and they put brother brandom out because he start out preaching to 400,000 went up preaching to 30 y you know 30 people or something or less and see they turned him out and just like it was to Samuel when God said they haven't rejected you Samuel they've rejected me they wanted Samuel and the organizational systems of this world wanted the great prophet of this day to come and have healing campaigns right one thing was to draw money for their own benefit but yet it was to benefit the people of healings and great things but when he begin to preach right and what did he say when you begin to say I and my father are one all right so then look at what it's doing now I want to I want to be slow if I have to real slow I want you to get this I've got notes written now that would take if I preach it four more sermons and I've never been that far ahead I hadn't I've never been that far ahead in 40 something years of preaching remember the son of David and the ladies in church a a Son of God excuse me they put him out he said but brother Dale they didn't put out the Holy Spirit no like not wanting it they want it to be there to the Great Signs and the Wonders but they don't want the word that is related to the holy spirit so you see what they're putting out you return down the word you automatically turn down the spirit and you can holler and scream all you want to I got the Holy Ghost right and you dress and act and do like the world now don't tell me too late right see in that way you can say I love the word but it's only up to a certain degree right so father what we're going through and in Luke watch look at the point they put him out they put the Holy Spirit out of the church you remember Wade Wednesday night and what he was bringing remember what brother Brown said that the Holy Ghost has been bound for 2,000 years at the door of Creeds and dogmas that's right but to be loosed in the end time by the last Angel's message right right so the Holy Ghost even in the Great Book of Acts you look right over it and there it was right in the church beginning to fall away right right see then the Holy Ghost never really been loosed for 2,000 years that's be back before Cal that's back before it came right you get the point the Holy Ghost has never worked the way he wanted to work right but it's to do that in the end time but look the let you see in age they put him out now son of God so look like he should have been saing and next he revealed himself as son of David that's supposed to be the next in line isn't it son of man Son of God Son of David 1 2 3 well look son of man Son of God Son of Man son of David and just in case some of you out there are so smart that you think four is an antichrist number I happen to know that is white black red pale but I happen to know that four is a restoration number right that's right justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the word that's right amen right so then we think we're so well I just cut him all CU he don't even understand for you got to pull Pit All I want is to ask you a question how can you go from Son of God to son of David to go to son of David you got to come back to earth that's something right so watch him and in Luke now he's put out of the lady of sin age Son of God and in Luke he said he'll be revealed as son of the as son of man the proph it come on fulfilling the rest of it see the scriptures TI perfectly together son of man Son of God Son of David the Myster is hidden right there in a few words that's right it is to come back from Son of God Through the Ages and the end time is to come as the son of man a great mystery that's right but yet everybody knows all about the prophet it came amen thank God but remember the prophet is just like Luther Luther preached the message of the just shall live by faith but the Catholic Church never got scared of him right it was when the people began to believe the message Satan wouldn't have scared of brother random he couldn't tackle him he knew better to try it but yet when he passed off look what he've done they've attacked his message from every form of could be thought of that's right that's right but look the scriptures tie perfectly together son of man Son of God Son of David what was it it's the same God all the time just changing his form in morphe right he just changing it it's a great drama to him he is acting it out amen that's right displaying himself as son of man the prophet God to come and die right can't kill Son of God can't kill son of David son of man right had to come but then he comes down Through the Ages as Son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost right but in the end time he's be revealed as son of man then he can go to Israel as son of David to me that's marvelous I saw it then and I rejoiced and you know I've cried and done everything in the book Tred to get people to see that well I just don't know don't want to get confused don't worry honey you already are you was born and I was born confused it's going to take the Holy Ghost to straighten this out and just because that he went from because now I'm going to show you something that's going to you're going to think I'm against brother brandom we're going to give you a quote after where while I or this maybe not this evening where he said he died son of man and Rose Son of God I thought the son of man raised that's right I thought the son of man flesh was one that appeared to marry that's right I didn't know it was just some theophany form of Son of God it's the way he's explaining how it's going to change dispensations it's going to change the way he's revealing himself CU I said of when he said who the man say I son of man they didn't get it so he said all right I got to bring the church ages right but what's going to be amazing is when we get about two more sermons over and we'll come back into what we preached all 40 something years he stands in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the son of man because she's going to give birth to him whether we believe it or not whether we want to be a part of it or not that's our choice all right what is it same God all the time just changing his form right well who is the last form of God in the Gentile dispensation of course the way most people believe it it was brother brandham now brother brandham was a part of the body of Christ cuz he was was a born again Christian that's right but he was not the complete IM morphe of God or the form of God we've been through all that we preached it over over over but follow it now remember between the Son of God and remember between the Son of God where would his thought be going when he would be going between the Son of God and what Son of God and Son of David he's going to come back as son of man does everybody what do you believe what I'm saying or not do you understand I can't reveal that I can't make you see it right but do you understand what I'm saying well we don't believe you we believe brother Brandon well I just read what he said no you argue with him but what about it look how he keeps referring and like I said isn't it odd cuz these all these quotes and things I deliberately brought in things about the the end time prophet of melachi 4 as to keep our thoughts in the line the son of man would not be in The Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time unless God fulfilled his word to bring Malachi 4 into being in Luke 17:30 and Revelations 10:7 that's right bless God I don't need no Prophet I'll just be what I'm supposed to be I'm going to be God made manifest now you're the devil that's just plain as I can put it cuz you got it in the wrong line if it ain't lined up straight we're not going to come out to the right thing that's right right and even if it's lined up perfect until it's revealed it does us no good that's right well it's been revealed to me cuz I read it that don't make a revelation you read the Bible before you heard the prophet that's right why wasn't it it was revealed to you why because God has to reveal it that's right amen okay let's go on now and get to thought look at the next one number seven God's provided place of worship 65 425 paragraph 192 talking about the coming of the Lord Jesus for the Holy Ghost and the living presence of the Living God Jesus said in St Mark here he said in that day the son of man will be revealed that's in Luke and brings it out in Mark also now remember not Son of God he came in three sons names son of man Son of God Son of David when he was on Earth he come as the son of man he was a prophet and I said is it coincidental that there had to be a prophet you know a man on Earth to bring the message in the end time if that don't give the honor and Glory to the position that brother brandom held in I don't understand you in your thinking cuz that puts the whole dependence upon whether or not God sent the man there's been a lot of good men and good thoughts and good preaching and thing but see we putting all I or I am at least I have everything I've got I don't have no extra basket you know in financial matters you don't put all of your eggs in the same basket well I don't have many eggs so it don't matter how many baskets I could put them in four baskets and wouldn't have to worry about too many in the baskets all right but in religious matters that's what I tried to say this morning if you're talking about a dispensation that reveals a different God from one time to the other then that's Den that's the doctrine of dispensationalist theology that goes into into the unified part of mankind trying to bring it out but to see the same God revealed in many forms but yet the same God that's wonderful to me I me but look he came in three sons name son of man Son of God Son of David when he was on Earth he come a son of man he was a prophet son of man is a prophet Jehovah himself called the prophets Jeremiah and them son of man what sayest thou Jesus come because he had to come according to the scriptures he had to come as the son of man Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me now they he was referring to his own s wasn't he because he referring to the prophetic side and he had to be a prophet son of man but after his death burial and Resurrection now he has been Son of God the supernatural the Holy Spirit see that's what come back on the day of Pentecost CU that son of man died to release that Holy Ghost and after his Ascension and the things that happened to that human element of his and I believe he raised in an eternal body amen so then you you're losing your son of man contact point I was just trying to bring out an illustration a moment ago that the prophet is right when he died son of man he rose Son of God on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came to prove it so it's going to be Son of God down to seven Church ages right all right and look what he goes on to say it's the great Holy Spirit this is the unveiling of God per 65 and notice now as he came he had to come a son of man because the holy spirit said that he would God would raise up a prophet to them so he could not come calling himself the Son of God because it wasn't that dispensation you got it right I need to walk back you put me down we got it got you we got we got it okay he could not come calling himself the Son of God because it wasn't that dispensation that's right all right he was the son of man prophesying to fulfill and revealed to them all the things that had been done and taught what he was then he was on the earth as son of man then say Luke 17:30 says he'll return a son of man it's no coincidence that God would send a prophet in this age and time right promised in the word now these are for me your statements but let's just get at least one out of it go ahead with number nine and think about what he's saying now we're in a change ing dispensation and never change just like building a building you come to the corner you have to make that bend it's strange everybody wants to run a straight line on down you'd have just one big wall but we're building a building and we've come to the corners and you got to change those Corners as Brother Don price so well he and so well stated it not long ago at those changes is where the Trouble Comes where the it's hard on that corner to make cut that corner and make it just right simple illustration we built a house in 1965 we had the you call them batter box boards or what is it called batter boards that you put out and you square everything up and you you get it and you run your strings you know and you you get that right and you start out and and it don't matter what this building you can take that corner to that corner and if the same thing is that corner to that corner it's Square he knows that's good right it's square if you ever want to do anything and you want to get it Square just measure from you know this is not Square so we'll cut it down a little it's measure this corner make sure it's same that corner you got it squired you can fool around all you want to you can cry and pray doing what you want to trying to Market just do that and it'll Simply Be Square we had to do things a little different in our day and easiest way to level a house a room is they got it new today cuz it got a water hose a water glass is the most simple thing if you wanted to see if this pull pit was level set a water glass fill it to the brim if it's off right it won't be right so what's he saying he said we're in a change in a dispensation all right he said everybody wants to go down the wall That's Pentecost and different ones come see easy if you can get one string to the other one to just keep things going we underpin a house one time and old house we lived in and and already had some kind of pillars in it and we were doing them well I came in one day and my little wife she had laid about uh 10 6 by 10 section of blocks and it was good good the only problem she had she laid according to the Contour of the land cuz she didn't know you go over step down step down she she just let them qu well she done it and she just took pieces of concrete and just put it in the top it was perfect we were going to stuck over it anyway so what it matter all right but you see anybody can lay a straight line if you got a string to go with it's easy he just gets distrain but when you come to a corner was I saying about that house we built the the the patter boxes or what you call them put them up well one day this cow decided she wanted to go through where the building was going to be so she tore down in the corner well I asked the man I said what in the world am I going to do he said we'll try to square it like we do corner to corner and do the best you can so we drove back to Stakes we put them up well it looked pretty good and they laid the blocks according to the strings I put by but when we got ready to put down the floor joist we come to find it out that it wouldn't exactly square and you know how you do it with floor joist if you want to make sure they're squared it's take you 4x8 sheet of plywood and nail it down on one corner it's going to square it so when they got over that corner it couldn't find out it was sticking over about 2 Ines and we had to do a little scabbing on you know but my point is I wasn't a carpenter but a real man that can make take that take that corner a real Carpenter can start right here on this corner and you can worry yourself to death he can go to another corner and start if he really knows what he's doing brother randam knew what he was doing that's what he said he come to change the corner right God sent us a profet to change the corner but what did he say we're doing we're not building a build a a a line a wall he said we're building a building all right see there had to be that last Corner turned to make this building come out right and let's say that a real Carpenter he doesn't have to have all of the modern things of lines drought for the Gir you can tell you you get three corners you can get the other Corner if you know what you're doing might be off for half inch quter inch on a big house but not much we got a problem for that I'm going to Sol we was doing something up at teran's one day he looked at it and he said daddy that ain't right said that corner's off said there's a gap there I said we just going to fill that up with cocking he said but Daddy they don't make 3/4 inch caulking all right Shake everybody a little bit but we're changing he said changing dispensation another know down below there we're talking about changing dispensation see when he come into the when this prophet came into being in the last days he knew that he wasn't just laying a straight line but you know what he had to do now this is me okay when theusa Street came in see Luther Wesley Pentecost when theusa Street came in they had the lines going straight supposed to be to start with it was up to him to find that corner so what did Brother randam do remember he had to back up to the Pentecostals and relay every bit of that that's right have you heard him enough on to say that you know his message didn't begin until 1963 but in the years of preparation he said and the I will restore the years of the can of worm P worm Locust the caterpillar so he had to back up to that line of zusa Street and know that was exactly right and shoot that line and get that line straight and rebuild a wall but then he had to make a corner that's right to make that finalized change or dispensation to turn that corner to head it back to hit back with Luther it had to be a prophet so then God would be promis in Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10:7 to send us a prophet to be able to take that word and turn that corner and square back up to be able to hit exactly on that other one CU hey folks you draw a line at 100 100 ft draw at 50 ft and if you don't get it exactly squared you can be an inch off in a hurry you remember the prophet you shoot the gun what about it you shoot a gun he said you're off a high here right you just twitch the viral you let something putch the barrel move it or something Danny Shake in his head these shooters know what I'm talking about 100 yards you're way off see he couldn't afford that God knew what he's doing so he went back and let that man relay all of that building he laid Luther in Foundation he laid w ly he laid to Pentecost brought it all back to Restoration that's right then he made the corner that's right all right now but when he made the corner I thought and I'm just honest and just always believed this I believe what the Bible says amen that the apostles prophets pastors of his teachers is for the perfecting of the Saints now once brother Ram got the corner laid and turned with his message now you and I can go straight down that line that's right as long as we stay with this message but remember we're trying to hit where Luther left off we're lining up Amen in the right way they say Tony and I believe he's the best tile layer in the country but if he don't like what it looks like and it ain't exactly right he'll take it up and do it again that's a good tile layer you say w it's just a 16th of an inch laying some at Richards the other day and I told him I said he said that sure is funny looking over one corner I said yeah but it' have been a whole lot more fun here if I hadn't leaned it see instead of putting it down square and being with the wall and all that being perfect I turned it made this wall straight and that wall come off about that far and if it hadn't this wall over here would look like that on one end and that way on the other end you ever hung vinyl you don't hang vinyl from the bottom you measure from the top down right and if you got to put anything out of line put it out of line on the bottom right and then lay it all up there and you come up to the top and you got 14 ft or 20 ft or 100 ft you want it to look right cuz you sure don't want it look like that on one then and that on the other one it shows up you don't know what you're doing so you get out of level down who's going to look at the bottom and say oh that ain't level no let see brother random put it right amen this message is Right amen he laid that corner perfectly his message is laid that corner he said we're not building a wall we're building a building well I thought the building that we were supposed to be building is the body of Jesus Christ into the stature of a perfect man amen right and I believe the five full ministry you see them now my Lord they come one time and got did and he said I want you to come to help me what you want and I know you can lay blocked I've seen you he said we're building chicken houses 300t long you can do it I said yeah but I said you wouldn't want to work my way he said what I said if it don't look right I'll tear it down start again I'm Tony with that he wouldn't like it for 3 days later I'm still turning the wall down putting it back cuz I want it to be right see this message is Right folks the prophet came and turned that corner he gave us all the dimensions all of the things and told us we got done on Wade's house remodeling it and we had a GU with a TR it to shoot it you know perfectly in line perfectly level we laid the for the foundation I look side that house we started lay to re BL I said this thing ain't right we said will he shot it was a Transit I know I help him I drove the stage and I marked the mark and put the stay right he said what do you mean I said it's out about 2 Ines and we can't afford that cuz the house is going to be sitting off the corner right you see that's how people are sometimes made for jobs of doing things Brother Gary does a marvelous job of building that's right it's good to build behind him you know it's good to work on something he's worked on because you can depend on it being Squire things will be right we see that's what we are in the five4 ministry the fold Ministry is to Build That Wall after the prophet turned the corner right now what do we build it with he gave us all the material he gave us everything I don't have to worry about laying blocks I just line up with a message and look down to there you get into machinist work any you have your machinist in here the Donny I know he's worked kind of around there but you know there's people that can see 5,000 of an inch in machinist work that's how good the eyeball is 5,000 that's a good chewing gum paper ain't even that thick if we're that particular why wouldn't we be particular is that not what Paul says be careful how you build upon the foundation is that scripture you get it lined up straight we've got to string strung from one corner to the other one we just keep laying it right on down the line four 40 years later we're still laying but somebody's going to complete this building it's going to be finished cuz we're changing dispensation it isn't a wall it's a building he builds a house and there's many cuts and turns that he's predicted here in the Bible why don't we believe it what are those turns and cuts let's deal with it just a little amen we're going to have another sermon out of this one look at number 11 we we kicked off 10 we can number 11 64 427 where he called a trial on tson Arizona paragraph 235 now Jesus never said in the days when the Son of God will be revealed he was revealed in the church age I read it he was revealed in the church age Son of God but the church has put him out that's right that's what they put out they put out the Son of God they didn't want it now when it begin to be lined up when that Prophet begin to get them corners and bringing it down they didn't like it it's too straight too straight to talk to women about cutting their hair painting the face wearing pants different things men long AR too straight I'll go somewhere where they don't preach on them things find you a building I hope you got that point on me well look he was revealed in the church ages as Son of God it's been the Holy Ghost in every Church Age come on 464 seal book justification sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost and another great prophet sent he refers to and I give you the quotes before ausa street is referred to as the prophet he said the Holy Ghost came himself that's right on the day of Pentecost ususa Street Pentecost then the word comes look 236 then he would be revealed a son of man when the son of man is being revealed God God manifested amongst the human beings like it was then son of man prophetic right Malachi for is Promised a SE her to come forth with a Voice come on R well how do you read that God manifest amongst the human beings well that was brother random when he come to preach he was a monk to human beings Glory that's good well now in a minute when we read it's in the people are you going to shout about that remember this morning raise your hand if you think you got the Holy Ghost raise your hand if you thank your bride raise your hand if you believe the bride going to be the fullness I go far wait a minute my hand not getting up right good all right you see that's what most people believe that's saying when the son of man is being revealed God among God manifested amongst the human beings like it was then son of man Prophet okay we go brother brandham was the prophet he had the resurrection message right he had the dead raising message physically and spiritually all right but now let's read on a little go to the next one number 12 which is the unveiling of God 1964 PR 73 far for his acts now remember he's in the acts of a play uh it's on the unveiling of God F must taken he said that he just acted the part of death cuz all of this is AC acting amen remember you got to have characters if you're going to have acting right for for his acts to change he changes his form then he came the son of man now watch divide that so don't read that he came the son of man and then think the next go watch he came the son of man now starts your sent for the reformers age Wesley Luther and all down through then we find out they got it so bundled up just like the Israelites did then when he does appear in the last days in the Pentecostal age as the Holy Spirit they rejected they did the same thing Israel did and what does he do now he's going to be rejected and then he returns as son of man and then from that son of David see how close we are son of man son of David Son of God is revealed in the last days as son of man according to Malachi 4 all the rest of prophecies pertaining to this hour no more dealing with the church after he they put him out on the outside knocking at the door some predestinated seed in there yet be he must get to them now we know brother random was put out we know that you know they finally got where they wouldn't even hard nobody W him but really where's he at now the first sermon I preached in this Lula was not at this church it was the week before in my home and then the next week here was going Beyond man's camp because that was 71 and they already started camping down and I preach going Beyond man's camp and you know what they' done be going Beyond man's Camp let us go out unto him you realize if he's out of the church sister Gil we better get out of it you remember the Catholic priest on the message he said we've either either got to get to church straight or get out of the church he's seen that much if God is outside the church where you want to be right well I'm going in there try to help them yeah they went to n to try to help them and they brought out a trinity Doctrine it's finally developed what do you want and I'm not against going anywhere as a matter of fact I've told you I ain't saying I won't go nowhere else and preach I didn't say that but I'm through with trying to preach outside of this church but I'd rather go right over there and preach in that Baptist non- denominational church then to try to go to people at this message and preach you can say what you want to about me you on internet anybody we ain't paying you and you ain't paying us because already to shut you out oh yeah I can call him up on the phone I'm going to be in your community next week you know I thought I might come by and preach for you that's what they tell me you know well how can you turn down a guy which tells you that fell came one time me and brother dick was outside the man came up he was supposed to come and sing he called me wanted to come and sing I said come right home I never mentioned preacher brother dick knows what happened man came up me and brother Dick and him we standing there talking he reached over in his car and he said if I want to preach today I better get my stuff in you and get ready brother dick looked at me and said he going to preach I said I reckon he is but my phone don't never ring they go anywhere to preach well I'm not sad at that I'm glad my voice is wearing out my body is wearing out the best for me just to stay home be the best I can I'm just if I quit I'll just sit down here we not worry about it cuz why why me be concerned with trying to go help somebody you go preach in their church and then way went one the other day man got it behind him you know and said now if there's any seed in it not worth seed just throw it out I have got up and said tell me where the seed is you know but that's the way people go where we at we turn his son of man then son of David how close we are look where we at go to the next one he's outside the church as Son of God trying to reveal himself as son of man and look as I said brother Brandon was welcome El in his early Ministry everybody wanted him oh he's got some strange Doctrine about serpent seed but we still want him cuz he draws a big crowd and we get a big old money out of it you know and we get a lot of people come in our churches well isn't it odd that's the way it was with the Lord Jesus that's right the young Prophet From Galilee was welcomed but when he begin to say I my father one he wouldn't too welcomed look what he says on the unveiling of God paragraph 8 184 oh brother sister are you catching it congregation says amen look don't don't you see it it's been veiled through these ages okay according to what God Said and it will be opened in the last days those Seven Seals would be broke and the full thing would come into view of the people what took place all along the hour of the seventh angel message what all the mysteries of God should be made known in that Elijah this last hour how that Christ is put out of his church the Son of God how he is revealed as son of man again how that the church is to be put in order and everything for the last days l no Creed no denomination you remember that quote from the message on the fullness of the godhead bodily brother said no leing among her brings the fullness of the godhead no Creed no denomination absolutely the word living in the individual I'll take one and leave one now he ain't dealing with just a prophet right I'll take this and leave that one that's just there's no strings no denomination no bindings or nothing it's the it's the heart with God and him alone he said see look at the next one the Rapture preaching 65 1204 paragraph 117 and now that's the age that we're living in right now the seventh Church age now it's all to be manifest in the grain of wheat at the end now are you with me did have the all of the message that I preached about the grain of wheat the original to come back if you lost that if it's not drop back about 3 months ago and start listening over and come up to where we at you'll see what I'm talking about notice it's all to be manifested in the grain of wheat at the end another comeback now if you'll take Luke the 17th chapter and the 30th verse he's referring to the grain of wheat and it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man begins to reveal himself what is reveal make his revelation of what he is in this day revealed reveal out to the people the word that's made known for the day revealed to the People by the manifestation of the Holy Spirit making that Jesus live among us that's a promise for this age let me get okay corn of wheat U byass 15 go to 16 the unveiling of God paragraph 318 and the remember the grain must be germatize see come back to Perfection back to regular grain again all right right the grain must be gered see if it don't it won't live see none of that was outside of them messages will ever come to life look how straight a man could talk it has to be gerti to it but remember the same life that was in the stalk is in the grain it's just maturing itself right back see the see he revealed himself what son of man the grain that went into the ground get the message congregation said amen oh boy ain't that something amen where are they now the Greek said to him we would see Jesus he said except the grain of corn fall into the ground see all right now I'll end right there I saying this go listen to s we would see Jesus and see if it's not referring that when they come to Jesus they come to see God go get the message when they come to see Jesus sir we would see Jesus they wouldn't saying we want to see Jesus you know they knew that had to be part they wanted to see God come on get it listen to the table see what your Prophet said they wanted to see God I'll bring it the next message nothing El when they got there they wanted to see God but what did God say God said lest a corn of wheat dies and go to the ground it theide alone but if it goes forth it'll come forth in multiple forms they wanted to see God the only way you'll ever see God is through the grain of wheat that goes into the ground the grain of wheat is the word the son of man is the only sewer of the seed that there is that's why brother brandom listen could stand here in the end time to not give us a different Revelation but could tell us what no man could ever tell you the Lord Jesus preached six seals in Matthew 24 he didn't preach the seventh that's right am I right that's right and see a Prophet come taking us into to not what Jesus didn't preach I don't believe that I don't believe brother random could bring anything to you and I that wouldn't in the word of God see Jesus knew he was the corn of wheat that going into the ground you remember the message the corn of wheat had to go into the ground in the dark ages to the church are you with me still in the message but promised to be restored to the full original grain again in the end time in The Bride of Jesus Christ I'm just trying to tell us where we are I wish have G out some way and I had a great education some words or something to be able to express it somebody has got to make the word manifest that's right I didn't write the message I wasn't the prophet that said the bride is to vindicate Malachi 4 right vindicate Luke 17:30 vindicate Revelations 10:7 and these other things well I didn't know he'd said that you got a computer run it in if you ain't call me but I put it on the message a dozen times man told me one time he said something I said you hang on a minute I got to go fire at my computer because my natural computer says brother R said so and so that's my brain but you don't you won't bleed my brain so if I can't find it if I can't find that quote for you all that he just said what I said it I'll send you an apology and you can send it to the world that I'm a false prophet I said because I know he said it I just don't have the memory to tell you the page number I reckon he figured if I was that straight about it then I knew what I was talking about but that's where people think well I don't know he said that that's why I read it you can't argue with me about what I read right come on musicians we'll make a number three out of this thing am but see church I'm just trying my best to get you and I to realize what God has made us it is he that hath made us the scripture said and not we ourselves the Bible says you can't even that was written for to come
