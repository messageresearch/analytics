Bible study then brother fornia be here on the fourteenth and then fellowship meeting will be on the third Saturday and remember all that remember late in June we'll be coming back I think Tuesday or Wednesday one so remember them in traveling Brett the Lord blessed be with Terence and Leasing them and the loss of Brittany their daughter now you know her mother her grandmother passed away and it was burying her today so remember all of those okay father we thank you for your grace and thank you most of all for you being you that way we can depend on you we don't have to worry about it you're the same yesterday today and forever we just have your way bless all of these remember all the ones that are traveling the children coming home bless all of these father and just let your loving grace be with us and take care of everybody father forgive our sins let your love be made manifest into our hearts and their lives you know there's many sicknesses of understand you made the promise you said that you would heal us and deliver us from our destruction so we believe did we commit it all to you just have your way now in Jesus name Amen we'll try to pick up where we left off if we can and continue on visions too for by grace are you saved through faith remember journey through a journey that not of yourselves it is the gift of God okay now let's go to Ezekiel thirty-six I told you to notice the way that it the reading because it's not just we read something and we say well that's what it said but then we keep on reading and see maybe find out what it's talking about so look what he says I have taken you from among the heathen and gathered you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land that's natural happening right okay then once he brings them back to their land now this is back Dhara remember this is before this is not coming this is a promise to the end yes because it will transpire but this is mine Liebeck dire that he's telling them what's gonna come as iki was looking forward to the children of Israel coming into their land then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols now cleanse you now watch he's gonna tell ya he's gonna do that code it's not talking about natural land and natural cleansing if the people and what's to take place a new heart also will I give you in a new spirit well I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in the land that I have that I gave to your fathers and you shall be my people and I will be your God you may be seated Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now to try to pick up where we left off this morning and to continue our thought I like for you to get involved in the things and you know no brother Joe brought me a thing and you remember this morning we were talking about how that you come to that let's pull that up pull it up to the clean heart clean soul but they could pull that up and remember we were talking about how we come to this part of life and what happened and what caused that to change and be into the unclean you remember but we backed up like this is a baby and then the baby comes down all right and it gets worse and worse and worse all right see that's what happens to me and you when we come to a point if that unclean spirit goes out and we don't get it replaced it's gonna come back and it's gonna be worse than it ever was so listen to what he says I'll read one above that I told him but you remember what I read are just quoted here while back brother Brent them for the message believe in God he says in the only thing that kept me from being saved when I was twelve years old was the spirit hung over me a devil saying wait a little while longer that's the reason you wasn't saved when you become the age of accountability a spirit you got in the crowd and that hovered over you and kept hanging over you you wanted to do right there's not a man that's got his right mind well what wants to do right but there something won't let you do it is that right it's the devil on here's the one brother Joe gave me from Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now there's two elements just for a few moments on this subject there's two elements that make up the human being one of them is your mind the other is your soul and the mine is your mental thinking not intellectual I mean your your intellectual and your soul is a part of God that's in you and when a man can when you're born into the world a child you grow into a living soul and we're going to grow into a living soul and at the age of choice you hear the Gospels in some way and something way down inside tells you to receive Christ well you say well I'm too young now I'll wait a little longer now there's where you make your first mistake right there for you grieve this person inside and he's describing the human being coming into the world that I was trying to and that was what I kind of ended up on of doing then I was asked a question they all stated this way that's the question what happens to that if that unclean spirit comes back into us brother Branham said the way back for a person as backslidden is the same way for a person that's lost you know I'm saying you'd have to come back to order and do this that years but he says the way that a person backslides then he said then that's the same thing it would have to be for a repentant sinner so you got to come back ask God to forgive you snakes in there you got to get him out all right now that's plain language to you because what the prophets say if that thing comes back when is it going to be a religious demon and you're not going to admit it's a wrong spirit you're going to think it's the Holy Spirit Cody's gonna tell you some good things if it's a religious demon it's going to tell you religious thing it's going to want to go to church come on now I'm sorry sorry for being blunt but anointed people religious anointed people who love the presence of the Lord will not lay out of services like people that are not anointed now did you get that and I need to quote that again see if that no Noi thing is on your spirit you're going to want to go to church you're gonna want to do not but what's wrong the guy inside he's gonna sit there no that ain't right tell it right I know what it is I know what it I know what this they don't want to listen to me I've got I've got it see that guy inside he'll override that guy outside you said brother they'll well okay that's where I stand because that will put it to the basis that I can follow it throughout the message but now listen the point that I'm getting to as I said this is to Ezekiel if speaking to Israel back dark pointing to coming of Israel to their homeland for number one and for the coming of the Holy Ghost to come on the day of Pentecost to the children of Israel all right so what does he say he says to two that he says I give you a white now look how hard it seats and we'll we'll use another scripture in just a minute but cast away from you your transgressions whereby and make you a new heart and a new spirit zekiel 1831 that's not 36 now 36 he's got another scripture I'm wanting to point to where you think he said in Ezekiel 1831 go ahead and pull that up if you want to that's number six just cast away from all your transgressions what about you transgress and make you a new heart a new spirit for why will you die o house of Israel now that's telling you read it cast away from you all your transmitter that's not talking about God just casting away all your trust it's you we need to cast away all our transgressions and things and make a new heart and a new spirit you said well that something for us to do that new heart a new spirit is something for you to do now back up one more scripture back up to Ezekiel 11 19 I think may not have this one's because it's cut off okay now watch what he says and I will give them one heart you can deal with all this other and you can get a heart you can Ollie say but when it comes to God he gives you one heart there's only one heart in the Bible I'm concerned with there's only one soul that word is heart our soul is totally interchangeable alright I give you give them one soul the only soul I'm interested in is the soul that God gave back that when he gave his soul a ransom it doesn't say the bible doesn't say he gave his heart a ransom they gave his soul see because he's dealing with the soul what now remember it's not but one heart watch that in a second now give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you and I'll take away that stony heart out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh okay all right so it was speaking of the coming of the Holy Ghost at Calvary in the Upper Room the experience and all like that code there's only one heart now read this one Malachi 4:6 that familiar with us milik I four sixes and turned the heart it does not say hearts it says turn the heart of the children to the father's that's the same heart as iki was talking about because that was what they were supposed to God and as the remnant part are the one true genuine Israelite they got that on the day of Pentecost right they got a new soul they got eternal eyes they got a new heart with that heart if not another heart it's a new soul it's God's own life okay God's own life all right now is that true now because there's only one heart now you're talking about and he doesn't say I'll give you new new hearts give you a new heart now go to Ezekiel 36 what we read our men to go and I will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathen which you have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that i am the lord says the lord god what when i have shall be sanctified in you before their eyes he's gonna do a work but i will take you from among the heathen together you're out of cut all countries and will bring you into your own land coming to Israel coming in a natural ok watch then I'll sprinkle clean water upon you washed by the water of the word that's Ephesians 5 of something all right because he says back that night with no he ain't out there sprinting water what I'm saying we read it but read it in this mind of understanding not what you're reading physical words I'll sprinkle clean was I could find a bunch of that don't you because of what he says and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols and I'll cleanse you now then but one thing and cleanse you from your idols and your think and that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost right come on now let's get it and watch it says a new heart also I will give you and the new spirit well I put within you okay we'll go to it and read it in just a minute but around said that's where people made their mistake because when it says a new spirit did they say that's the Holy Spirit he said no that's not the Holy Spirit will read it on down a new heart will I give you that's what we won't you said well what's the new heart that white drawing in it perfectly clean right the heart drawing of the soul of the individual and it beautifully perfectly clean that's the soul I want to be able to come before God because that's the only one that dove can come into can't come in where there's an unclean spirit what won't dwell in an unclean vessel so don't think you're gonna put the devil in God in the same soul that's where I tried to tell the two so people that in the seventies I said show me that the Bible said he won't do it see they had two souls one from garden one from the devil he said well you're still fussing about that now you know what if I was overseas you know what they'd ask me the question about who started that doctrine cuz I happened to be over there one day then they asked something I said no you got the wrong name you got the wrong man claiming he preached that doctrine he said what are you talking about there's people all over the world that they still deceived by this part of understanding the soul the spirit the doings they still got that same doctrine listen a new heart I'll fill what I give you a new spirit when I put within you that's not the Holy Spirit watch that and I will take away that stony heart out of your flesh and I'll give you a heart of flesh clean that soul out make it pliable make it acceptable of God make it not stoning you know I bless God I got my way I believe what I believe you ain't gonna tell me no different I believe what I believe that right tires gonna send a lot of people to the wrong place yeah come on look what he does now a new heart also what I give you and a new spirit when I put within you and I'll take away that stony heart out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh that's just cleaned now watch the scripture and I will put my spirit within you run said ours the Holy Spirit that's not your spirit we'll get to that point in a minute and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you see I'll keep my judgments and do them and you still dwell in the land that I give you right back to the same park my because the world is to be redeemed as well as only others let's see I had one more No we'll leave that alright we back on where Wes was this morning the last thing we read was reading from and North it not where brother branham was describing the human being in describing the body with the five sentences the spirit were the five senses in the soul as one sense free moral agency he calls it all right now he said if you'd ever get this right you'll understand what the truth evidence of the Holy Ghost is now the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he no let's don't change the Bible and going there and race out words and put it let's just read it like it hit undo so not a new heart a new soul get there to get it right no one is speaking of a heart as a man thinketh in his heart as a man thinketh in his soul his being of what he is you don't think the Prophet says with your body you don't think with your soul that's why you can love God genuinely love God with your spirit and all kind of signs and wonders and still be lost in the soul now that's the mystery that the end time didn't get even then he hid when the Prophet come along I'm saying that is honest as I can say it they ain't getting it now and they ain't getting it cuz they don't know what it is okay now watch as a man thinketh in his heart the devil thinks through his mind to show him something with his eye but his heart will make him believe something that would be impossible to look at because it's the faith that he has in his heart it's off the message united under one head he believes in his heart the devil thinks through his mind to show him something with his eye but his heart will make him believe something that would be impossible what about it what do you think from the Bible said that a man thinketh in these are now you know the story the prophet went through many many times that's got here you want a word that they found a little inch square compartment in the human beings heart and said that could be the abode of the soul the heart of man is the soul of man the heart of anything watermelon what everyone is this seed of that fruit is what we call the heart huh as a man thinketh in his heart as he thinks from his soul being and what he is cause ain't nothin in the heart think with that's the thumping gizzard it won't work alright so then the Bible he said then see he said God he said I always said that the Bible was right as a man thinketh in his heart he said that's the way he believed it well I think that's the way were to all think about and believe it as a man thinketh in his soul his heart his being coz I've got him if you wanted I've got the definition of heart and the definition of soul even though there's a higher phrase difference between the two words they're basically the same word taking and showing it from the the concordance if you want then I'll be glad to give it to you but listen Church this is what I want to know I give you a new heart and a new spirit I told you the warning for old message was what the danger stage of sanctification is for the unclean spirit to come back and what to happen the people become anointed on their spirit and do all signs and wonders the yet brother Ron said it's still lost do we actually believe that or do we put our whole life upon some form of experience listen I found that one while ago that we'll have time to get to read it but I was ahead is it off the message why there's so many Christians it harder to live the Christian life he said brother Branham I got all the evidences that would be number four fifteen good enough he said I know but we're not talking about evidences we're talking about the product he said I've seen healer and shout all kinds of things but the product is the product and I love that part don't you alright but he said I'll give you a new heart all right do you see that part now they give you a new heart he takes away that old stony heart these you lead looking to sin what do you see the beautiful picture of a heart wouldn't oh nothing in it because he can't give you one that's got wrong in it so what's he gonna do work on what you got he ain't gonna give you a new soul you know he ain't gonna take your soul out no more than he don't take your heart out he's going to give you an opportunity to be saved redemption is not taking out and replacing is that doctrine is in the message also that they call it the exchange of the soul I asked them a simple question I said what's the difference in exchange or change they didn't know the difference to me it's the same thing when they're saying you take out something and put something back in play God has never done mankind out of what he's going to redeem he ain't told this world away right he's going to redeem this earth is that the whole message of future he's not going to annihilate your soul he's going to work on the nature of it the nature of it is what it is if the unclean spirits in there the nature of it is the devil if God is in there the nature of it is God that souls in prison is that the nature of your soul is God if you're born in sin if notice of the devil ain't no in-between no options but let's just take this let me just read some where you won't misunderstand me about this stony heart in this new spirit and then finally get to the point of put my spirit and listen to your prophet let's go to number 12 will start dire cold we got you were to see the stack I had on this one go to number 12 on the message called Intervale God promised through the prophets have said we'll write my laws in their hearts now how's he gonna write it allow any heart but there's what the Bible says he's gonna have to write it in your nature of you being what you are take away that stony part that's against everything and make it mellow in other words talking to that Jew take that nature away from that Jew that he right now hates us but one day he's gonna love us think about all of them ain't talked about no natural nation I'm talking about dogs that will finally receive Jesus Christ they're gonna love you cuz they're gonna find out what you doing I'll write my laws in their hearts now put it in the tables of their hearts showing that that would be the dwelling place of God in the human heart okay that's transmitted work so human soul okay not to human head but the human heart amen I'll write them in the heart and in their art and they'll keep my statutes and so forth saith the Lord God said in another place over in Ezekiel he says I will in that day take out your old fleshly stony heart and I'll give you a new spirit and I'll put my spirit in you okay now listen to a lot of people even Pentecostal people lots of time gets mistaken in there you get a new spirit that's not God's Spirit that's you that's what he said that's you that's not talking about God that's what he's saying that's where the people missed it they said the new spirit was God he said no that's you he said then he'll put his spirit in you is it now that's the holy spirit so read it you get a new spirit that's not God's Spirit that's you that isn't God you get it a little happy now you see why I'm hollered so much about justification chopping off you PI sin you come to order you're happy you go home rejoicing everything's fine and wonderful well after a while things start coming back and you become the old person you was right this is where I got it okay he said that isn't God you get a little happy because you get a new spirit you say where's that new spirit working on your spirit and trying to go into that person that's pure and white and work upon that but that's you remember the pure White's you now so this is you because you get a new spirit you jump up and down run around over the floor maybe it's out a little bit and speak with tongues run around a little bit and think you got the Holy Ghost that's not it that's a new spirit God gave you that's you then after he give you your spirit then he said I'll put my spirit that's what's the matter with miss me or Crouch you think you're right miss me was what he said miss me or crowns miss me or crams that's when you think you're right and it's wrong you got today that's right the reason you think here nowhere with God see you think you're right you have listen if you believe the Bible you have a new soul part of you God has taken your soul washed it out of the unclean spirit to God all of those things through sanctification chopped off your sins made you a wonderful person then a new spirit comes into view and you think you got to haul the spirit come on we read from Ezekiel do we need to read it again then it says I gave you a new heart a new spirit then on down it says and I put my spirit in you go listeners what's your prophet saying going to the next one what was that one thirteen or fourteen thirteen why did so many Christian is hard I give you a new spirit and I put my spirit now listen to this the new spirit is put right in the middle of you then you're gonna have to read and listen to what he's saying well this go right met while right the new heart okay I'll give you a new spirit and I'll put my spirit known as I said the other way but I'll bring it right back to it the new heart is put right in the middle of you the new heart that's you so that's your being when it's clean of the devil white clean it's right in the middle of you call this your heart and the new spirit I'm just wanting to reading that part looking at it two different phases what this one says the new heart is put in the middle of you and the new spirit is put right in the middle of your new heart that's why everybody thinks it's the Holy Spirit read it new heart is put in the middle of you so you clean set aside Stoney gone away wrote it down then what is it to say a new spirit and the new spirit is put right in the middle of your heart in the middle of your soul is the new spirit well I thought it no that's where the wrongs that in his spirit is right right in the middle of the new spirit you get a new heart new soul you that's you what would you thread he gives you a new spirit it's put right in the middle of that soul now when he says my spirit it's foot right in the middle of that spirit if you'll just think just simplify he cleans out the old soul right it's pure and completely clean I asked you the question this morning over and over what are you gonna do with that person what are you from the time that you're sanctified do you get the baptism with all the ghosts that might be two minutes or 10 years what does it matter what are you you are what you was you was a human being you had your own nature that didn't go out brother Branham says my conversion did not take out the part that I loved to hunt right no what is it you clean that soul up something's got to come in place up he says a new spirit comes in we got some more keep on them read it again the new heart it's put right in the middle of you and the new spirit is put right in the middle of your new heart in his spirit is put right in the middle of the new spirit we've always stacking them up he's explaining Redemption the soul is swept and cleaned by the blood of Jesus Christ the soul the heart the soul of man and then a new spirit company what what do you need that new spirit far when he's going to put his spirit in there okay let's keep reading know more about it the prophets got the answer where are we 13 okay go to 14 yeah okay yes that's what we need today is experiences of the new birth now I want you to watch the order that Ezekiel brought it in what is it go bring in the experiences are that new birth to tell you how to get the new birth Ezekiel tells you right there what he's saying and that's what we need today is experiences of the new birth now I want you to watch the order the physique you brought it in he said I'll give you a new heart and I'll give you a new spirit and I'll put my spirit in here now that we need to read that over from Ezekiel to show you this in the Bible come on somebody raise your hand if you need to read it again so you're satisfied is what he's saying but I want you to watch there's three of it a new heart I'll take away the old Stephanie Hardaway there's the old different heart you had that's you that's that old soul that's you that's that being that person you klenda that out by the whole by the sanctification the word is done and brought you to a place that you're standing there like the draw it is perfectly clean now he tries to help you because he gives you a new spirit well that's the Holy Spirit I said that's when I got out you ain't reason I'll take the old stony heart away that's that old different heart you have and I'll give you a new spirit now many times and there's been a terrible mistake the people it's thought sometimes that the new spirit was the Holy Spirit but it isn't it's a new spirit when you need it far we're gonna read what he said what do you need that new spirit God gives you new why why'd you give you a new spirit what raise it up worry about it might certainly somebody raise it up or down good we need to say okay there you go but it isn't a new spirit God gives you a new why you couldn't even get alone with yourself with your old spirit now he's talking about cleaned out vessel sanctified vessel right with a new spirit in it come on we're gonna read some more in a second huh yeah you couldn't even get along with yourself with your old spirit how you gonna get along with the Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost is God's own spirit right come on God had to give you a new spirit so you could get along with his spirit and some townspeople a new heart and a new flash so you will receive it then a new spirit in that heart then I'll put my spirit in that you see new heart and you spirit my spirit three things he spoke of well as soon as you get the new spirit then which one you talking about one two three which one is he talking about one is the heart new next is the spirit the next is the Holy Spirit right one two three well as soon as you get the new spirit you quit you're stealing you quit you're lying things like that you say Oh hallelujah I got it and you find out the first time anyone crosses your path a little bit oh mercy what a difference see you blow up like a frog eating buckshot and let me tell you brother that's the reason you never got God's Spirit Oh now remember back a few weeks ago you remember how we've tried to explain it the brother Branham says you have accepted Jesus Christ right but says has he accepted you do you remember that you've accepted Christ but as he accepted you right back sign statement go look that's the reason you never got God's Spirit the reason you never got the Spirit of God is because you get messed up in that new spirit part you stopped seeking God come on church and many times have I said it I'd rather seek God out of my life find out at the end that I got something then to get out the end find out I didn't have nothing because of my religious over brother della he's seen visions he sees angels he's heard God's voice he's done all kind of oh he's got to be that that don't mean a thing that's what I said brother Brennan says we talk about experiences he said I want the product I want that new spirit I don't want this the new spirit I want God's Spirit that's the Holy Spirit come on you say he stepped on my toe I'll just not put up well that shows what you got in you oh that's true I'll put a new spirit in there and then I'll put my spirit in you now the heart is the center of the emotions of the human being right translate soul in that your soul is the middle of you cuz that heart salts what you are that seems like it right so God puts a new heart in the middle of the old man he cleanses up the man right he sank justifies him he sanctifies him he makes him a new man he don't take it out throw it away he's still work you know and I said earlier emotions of the human being your heart is the middle of you that's exactly right so God puts a new heart in the middle of the old man and he puts a new spirit in the middle of the new spirit our heart and he puts the spirit in the middle of the new spirit now there's a Redemption it gives you a new heart you don't take it out throw it away right he cleanses that that you are then he puts his spirit in there Wow remember the drawing and asking what would you need something far or what happens between your justification same thing in the new birth if you don't get to hat Satan will come back so that's you right come on we get that one done 14 okay let's go to the next one forget it mark 15 we don't know sometimes I get the wrong numbers only cause like everything else when is it so many Christians find it hard to live the Christian life I live the life of the croc you get a new spirit you quit your drinking supposed to tell everybody you understand what I'm reading is far he's showing you under that new spirit that you get you turn out to be very religious and you wind up wanting to go to church you want him to live right you're wanting to do right but you're still not right well bless God I love God you can't tell me I love him I do everything that he says and don't do it Percy hypocrite the best way to say it now listen you get a new spirit you quit your drinking you get a new spirit you quit your drinking line you get a new spirit you can do most anything with that spirit ain't talking about a new spirit right but that isn't what God's talking about a new spirit he said I'll give you that once I give you a new heart and a new spirit why he'd have to give you a new spirit to live for him that's not the Holy Spirit that's the spirit my son that comes to you for to try to help you don't get helmets Oh cuz it says beer that's it you don't understand cause you don't want to understand you said in your bygone ways for all these years but get out of it what do you think we're here 50 years after the prophets gone and I'll tell you that judgment one way or the other I preached that 40 years ago 50 - matter of fact I've been screaming about all of this well I don't remember you preaching that that turns up my righteous indignation okay but that isn't what God's talking about a new spirit I said you know what forgive me for that I give you a new heart a new spirit well you have to give you a new spirit to live for him well you couldn't even live with yourself with the spirit you did here you couldn't live with your neighbor you couldn't associate it with the next man on the next corner you couldn't associate with these Christians why you've had an awful spirit so it has to give you a new spirit I give you a new heart a new spirit no once and I'll put my spirit in you there's the difference I'll put my spirit in you and there's where you find it so hard as you go down to the churches and you get a different concept you know what I believe I ought to go to church is that a religious attitude then you go back home and say hallelujah I got it no you haven't then you go down to church and yourself oh I believe that something's happened I don't look at things the way I used to hallelujah in a few days you find yourself right down into the same old rut he was doubting reasoning everything else well now if pastor Sancho said that was right I don't believe it right I just take his word for it I'll tell you I'm going I'll have to worry about that around here you ain't gonna take his word for it well that's you read it that's why I read it I tell you what I've got to say about it you listen to me but you can't argue what he says come on you try to do it let's see oh you say brother I've got all the evidences I know but we're not talking about evidences that sorted we're talking about the product that's right yes sir I've seen heaters out I seen them speak with tongues I've seen them lay down a pencil and write an unknown tongue and the witch rise up and read it interpret it and tell the truth if a man could speak with tongues if a man could see out if a man could see visions if a man could do any of these that these other things that hope he can do without divine love they are lost in other words for you to do that without your anointed ones do you get it that's right Christ is in the heart don't get deceived by signs and evidences Christ is in the heart now I ain't kidding you I'm asking if you want to use your computers type in new heart new spirit sit down and read a while cause you're gonna read a long while if you don't get it that away right type in stony heart and see how many of them brother branham will say I'm just giving you a very few all right number 16 where did we get that far number 16 this is from the message impersonation of Christianity they say yes sure I don't want to go to hell I want to accept Christ that's alright that's good that's just your first step what's that a new desire I want to do right now I know I'm a Christian I go I'll smoke one more then I'll throw it away many of you live that ain't Timbo will you die on your head for me and you've been together and you try to quit these things but without him it don't work ain't picking on him I pick Adobe okay but now that's the new spirit excuse me he's stop just for a moment that's all she had to do but now that's the new spirit to notice the order of the scripture after you get a new heart and a new spirit he said that I'll put my spirit see oh that's what that's the what the scripture says here that's the order the numerix are in numerical order of the scripture a new heart a new spirit and in my spirit then God's Holy Spirit God's new heart then he put in you sets right in the center of you okay and that's that's your impulse or what motivates our makes you going is from the very end word part of you come on not just your second realm of your spirit listen your impulse for you your emotion goes out and the new spirit since right in the center of the heart your new spirit is going God's Spirit is going right in your it's gonna come into your heart before it works on to the next stage so don't just don't take that as him saying it's wrong he's saying it right then you spirits that's right in the middle of the you are because that is exactly what is invent explain it then where does it go and God spirit the Holy Spirit since right since right in the center of your new spirit and there it controls your emotions he says like a - praying of a watch they don't just read something and you'll read it in your mind or click new spirit sense right in the middle of the news new heart he said well that's what he was excited that's right but don't he went right on to explain it and God's Spirit watch this order new heart new spirit God's Spirit sometimes read by revelation instead of reading what you think it says but remember you're doing your own interpreting he said the minds praying and if I must watch it's no wonder you don't have to want it every day God's wound it once for all and he says right in the middle of your life the new life and as the minds frame as it really read leaves and ticks away the watch it controls every little organism oh that was too perfect okay we're at 16 go to 17 still only impersonation of Christianity wrote it up oh excuse me let's back her down cuz that's where she's going the whole thing now watch the Bible I'll give you take the old Stoney Hardaway and give you a heart of flesh tender-hearted and I'll give you a new spirit then I put my spirit in you know what his spirit was different from your new spirit the spirit is different from your new spirit he gives you a new spirit then he comes in and his spirit lives in that's the new birth I'll put my spirit now watch his spirit was different from your new spirit and many people get the new spirit and think they got the holy spirit they get feeling happy and jump around and maybe do a few things religiously and they think that they got the Holy Spirit oh no the Holy Spirit makes you act different the Holy Spirit makes you think different the Holy Spirit was put right in the middle of your new spirit and your new spirit is put right in the middle of your new heart he's coming about backwards now come on the new heart the new spirit in the middle of the heart and God says I'll put my spirit in you now then God's Spirit gets right in the middle of your spirit your new spirit then you don't have to go out and act like mirror's Jones does and like mirrors you'd be like a sister told me one time she said I know my children how the Holy Ghost the baptism with holder goes she's called I was Darwin they receive the baptism I'll hold off and said every one of them come for speaking in tongues I'm not gonna go into an elaboration I'm will just make the statement I said do you believe your daughter doing what she's doing right now oh that's what she'd called me to talk to him I said you believe your daughter is doing what she's doing right now and you say she was born again by the new birth I said I don't believe it you never called me no more no she wanted me to tell her kids were safe I ain't gonna tell you you're safe nor your children are safe I ain't gonna tell my wife's I ain't gonna tell my kids are safe I ain't gonna tell my grandkids the great-grandkids and whatever they are I ain't gonna tell you your safes I'm gonna tell you you got to tell me so there's got to be your experience not mine so what'd he say Newhart Zico's exactly right he's explaining the plan of salvation now come on brother branham goes here from these old tapes back in the fifties and sixties and he goes to the future home and he said I've talked three stages from the beginning and never changed one iota so he always talked what Newhart no cleansing you out set in your side God putting his spirit in you a new spirit and then the Holy Spirit coming to live in you there's the new birth but I say this without the crying in the deepest parts of my heart the biggest part of our religious Society is based upon what he just said he said people believe that new spirit means they have the Holy Spirit but he said it's not it's his spirit put in you is your Holy Spirit hey where'd we get to okay listen church I'm sorry to be offensive in words I said to her the other day they don't wine in the world and I say that about the women in the advertisement and it was for sale maybe I didn't say it but they're so human being repented because I didn't outright say that because it's your right you want to go out and show yourself to the world and act like the world it's not my responsibility other than telling you the truth you go cut your hair women it's your responsibility not mine but if I tell you it's wrong it's not me telling you it's wrong that's a word man you go out and do something that's nothing for them in my brother Dale don't preach this clothesline and this that in the oven ever service you know is your wife worthy of the gospel you know is this let's get two women straightened up or you know if y'all would get straightened up we'd be ready to go what if everybody's waiting on me oh you base everything on dreams and visions inside hey you want me to tell you feel you want me to tell you when I had a dream and showed all of you gone in the rapture and me walking back into the world in the darkness what you don't know it was you know one thing for sure I had a happy heart because I saw you go on they don't matter about this old boy sister Barbara had a dream one time that each one around here was kind of needing to be carried a little bit and since she'd look and said wanted me said known brother Dale shoulder and said I had a wallet set that and down and pick up a nut and put it on his shoulder never that sister bar we'll see that's the happiness for me I can say from the bottom of my heart if I miss it I still am proud for what God has revealed to me but he hasn't made known to me all these 50 years that I can stand on it and still believe the same thing that I believe 50 years ago and it just keeps unfolding unfolding that's the way I know whether I'm born again or not it's because what I preach cannot be tore down oh you're exalted now I'm just telling you as far as I know the truth I've tried to bring you the plan of salvation from what the Prophet had to say but how many of you is the same as the prophets it where it says I give you a new heart father God I give you a new spirit you thought well that's the Holy Spirit cuz I got it from that altar I prayed and I cried and Gardner and I kind of learn I felt so good and I just went out and I've been living for the Lord ever since but I'll tell you this and one more time on sale you anointed ones will outshine you ain't gonna like this one look away anointed ones because they believe their anointing is what saves them and what happens they're going to outshine in life the real genuine because the genuine is not putting their life upon some works or Salvage I mean some something they've done what they've seen what they yes he I've seen the Lord through his opening of his word that's greater than to me than all the other things that I've seen because you tell me some of the point of the new work when you're prophet right to her message after message after message explained a new heart and that was the Stoney take that away explains give you a new spirit and he said puts that into your heart or the center of you but he said that ain't right then he gives you his spirit to put inside of there no wonder Paul said come on musician Paul summed it up by saying it's not I that liveth the Christ that liveth in me the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith for the Son of God now Stan but we got we are and I know [Music]
