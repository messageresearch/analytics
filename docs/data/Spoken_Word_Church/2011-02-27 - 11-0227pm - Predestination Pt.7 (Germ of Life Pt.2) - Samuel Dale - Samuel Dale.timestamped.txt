[27:16] read in
[27:17] John
[27:19] 12 try to disc continue the thought on
[27:22] this morning cuz I didn't get to finish
[27:23] all the notes and and the quotes and
[27:26] things so we'll continue that on
[27:29] Amen I uh ran off one back there of what
[27:33] one statement I'd made this morning and
[27:35] I made it just a little incorrect so I
[27:37] figured I better give it to you exactly
[27:39] but brother Brown said on the Statue of
[27:41] perfect man
[27:43] 1962 uh 10:14 the morning service which
[27:46] would be page 58 it's talking about the
[27:49] gold standard to throw her back on the
[27:51] gold standard and you people just keep
[27:53] your homes and things but you belong to
[27:56] the Catholic Church church right see I
[27:59] said you'll take the mark of east or
[28:00] something like that but it said but you
[28:02] belong to the Catholic Church the nation
[28:04] belongs to the Catholic Church the whole
[28:07] thing is captured right in like that
[28:09] through their
[28:11] currency so you know maybe one of these
[28:14] days we'll have to give up our
[28:16] homes that's right that's a you know you
[28:20] say well I don't think that'll be for us
[28:23] well all right that's up to God and
[28:27] really it's up to me and you cuz I
[28:29] preached many many years ago
[28:32] a sermon on persecution now not
[28:35] tribulation I don't believe in it now
[28:38] persecution pre-tribulation and thing
[28:41] and why we we must have
[28:43] it I remember the title remember the
[28:46] sermon see why we must have it you know
[28:47] why CU we won't line
[28:49] up and if we won't line up God's going
[28:51] to line us up so he may make us hungry
[28:55] may make us a lot of things not put us
[28:57] in in the tribulation no
[28:59] way but you say well I don't believe
[29:01] that that's what our God would allow us
[29:04] to do well he did your brothers and
[29:06] sisters does he love you
[29:08] more I guess you think you're special or
[29:10] something he loves you greater but I'm
[29:12] sorry that just won't won't pan out okay
[29:16] but just remember that remember now the
[29:17] Bible study will be uh this coming
[29:21] Saturday at 6:00 and then we will be

[31:56] verse3 blessed be the God and father of
[31:58] our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us
[32:00] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[32:03] places in Christ according as he has
[32:06] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[32:08] of the world that we should be holy and
[32:10] Without Blame before him in love having
[32:13] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[32:15] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[32:17] according to the good pleasure of his
[32:19] will to the praise of the glory of his
[32:22] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[32:24] in the Beloved in whom we have
[32:26] Redemption through his blood the
[32:27] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[32:29] riches of his grace wherein he ha hath
[32:33] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[32:35] Prudence having made known unto us the
[32:38] mystery of his will according to his
[32:40] good pleasure which he ha purposed in
[32:42] himself that in what that in the full
[32:45] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[32:47] of times he might gather together in one
[32:49] all things in Christ both which are in
[32:52] heaven and which are on earth even in
[32:55] him in whom whom also we have obtained
[32:58] an inheritance being predestinated
[33:01] according to the purpose of him who
[33:03] worketh all things after the counsel of
[33:06] his own will that we should be to the
[33:08] praise of his glory which first trusted
[33:11] in Christ now let's go over to
[33:14] John
[33:16] 12 verse 23 and
[33:21] 24 you know immediately that this is
[33:23] when they came to Jesus and they said
[33:25] sir we would see Jesus
[33:27] and this was his answer back of the only
[33:29] way you'll ever see Jesus right and
[33:32] Jesus answered them saying the hour is
[33:34] come that the son of man should be
[33:35] glorified verily verily I say unto you
[33:38] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[33:40] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[33:42] it die it bringeth forth much
[33:46] fruit you can read on the rest of it let
[33:48] you be seated let's just stop there
[33:50] because that's what I want you to get
[33:51] the the point of
[33:53] seeing that he is that corn of wheat and
[33:57] we must be that all right and uh now
[34:02] talking of
[34:04] predestination you I hope you enjoyed
[34:07] this morning try to bring out a few
[34:10] things cuz I just thought of that the
[34:12] other day and I thought well sometimes
[34:14] it's easier to understand something by
[34:17] to use tops and shadows and uh to see
[34:21] things that way so you know that's why I
[34:23] chose to use and it to me it's very f to
[34:27] see that that the children of Israel in
[34:29] the
[34:30] natural they were brother R said in the
[34:33] church a book it was necessary that the
[34:36] people of Israel the children of Israel
[34:38] be there and be their way for the people
[34:41] to stand the Jews to stand and be
[34:44] against Jesus cuz see the predestination
[34:47] of God even your natural life is coming
[34:50] by predestination because that's right
[34:52] uh who or how did you get here yep you
[34:56] know like he said that there's many uh I
[34:59] know people will argue and say there's
[35:00] only one egg but you can argue with
[35:03] brother random all you want to he says
[35:05] there's thousands of eggs and thousands
[35:07] of germs comes down or sperm and he said
[35:10] it's not the first ones that meet said
[35:13] even your natural birth is by
[35:14] predestination said it'll crawl over and
[35:17] connect because that way then uh you
[35:20] know all of it is uh gathering in what
[35:23] he desires but see the children of
[35:26] Israel natural Seed of
[35:28] Abraham you know they as I said they
[35:32] showed their
[35:33] colors right because they would not swap
[35:35] with the word all right so then the
[35:38] spiritual seed showed their Colors by
[35:40] staying with the word like Joshua and
[35:42] Caleb and you know uh Isaac staying with
[35:45] it AB Abraham being with the word you
[35:50] and you come to find out then that they
[35:52] were the they were the Christ are the
[35:54] seed was there in them and I believe as
[35:58] I said this morning I believe that those
[36:02] people come with a seed within them yes
[36:05] all right and uh you know I believe
[36:08] that's the point that that we need to
[36:10] look at I believe everybody can with an
[36:14] opportunity one form or the other to be
[36:16] able to serve God right whether you
[36:19] Worship in totem poles in Africa or at
[36:22] the North Pole with the Indians and them
[36:24] worshiping things you know still there's
[36:27] a connection there to God because God
[36:30] created us right all right then we want
[36:32] to worship him you know then we pervert
[36:35] that and turn it away I don't believe
[36:37] Judas this carot was any different baby
[36:39] than anybody else he wasn't a mean
[36:41] little devil all the time you know no he
[36:44] he wasn't that Adolf Hitler he was a
[36:48] probably a good little baby and all like
[36:50] that and probably tried in his life to
[36:52] be decent you know but then he turned
[36:56] and you know you know and was against
[36:57] the Jews and brother BR said that you
[37:00] know he didn't understand because he was
[37:01] a half Jew see and you know but he the
[37:06] story goes with Hitler that see he he
[37:08] wanted the Jews to raise up and fight
[37:10] and he figured they would but they
[37:12] wouldn't do it so that turned him
[37:15] hatefully against them right and you
[37:17] know he began to kill them all over
[37:20] because that they wouldn't even raise up
[37:21] and fight right but they could not do
[37:24] that because they were under that period
[37:25] of time that they had to be drove back
[37:27] to the Homeland right and had they took
[37:29] their money which they owned Germany
[37:31] basically the the Jews did if you know
[37:34] your history you know they were the
[37:36] money people they were the money people
[37:38] in every country that they've ever been
[37:39] in and they could have took that money
[37:41] and CA uh insurrections and all kind of
[37:45] things but it wasn't a time so God held
[37:48] back from them doing that and and
[37:50] allowed Hitler to come forth and them to
[37:52] drive them back to the Homeland all
[37:54] right but now see there's a natural
[37:57] people all right then there is a
[37:59] spiritual Seed of Abraham that was in
[38:02] the Old Testament did you follow that
[38:05] all right then when we come into the New
[38:07] Testament down through the church
[38:09] ages then we come forth to see that they
[38:13] would also be a religious system of the
[38:17] churches and the things that would form
[38:19] organizations after every man you know
[38:22] went forth with his message like the
[38:24] prophet said a message in Elish about 3
[38:27] and 1/2 years and then they would begin
[38:29] to organize or or denominate that
[38:32] message you know and things and by doing
[38:35] that then we
[38:36] see that at the same time there was a
[38:39] spiritual group of people that's right
[38:41] which was the Christ that would come
[38:44] forth to follow the word and you have
[38:46] them in every age see that they came
[38:48] down you know maybe it got small amount
[38:51] you know but then it it it was still no
[38:55] matter if you just had one person that
[38:57] would be enough for God to display his
[39:00] seed upon the Earth so right I believe
[39:02] people came with a seed in them I
[39:04] believe the Old Testament people had a
[39:06] seed in them in those that were the
[39:09] Christ of the time you know not
[39:10] everybody now but in the Christ of the
[39:13] time and it was planted there because of
[39:15] for knowledge of God that he knew who
[39:18] would you know do what they would do and
[39:20] and line up but I believe it goes back
[39:23] further than that into the very mind of
[39:26] God
[39:27] to where that God would have a family as
[39:30] I saying Wednesday night right see this
[39:33] didn't have Hazard happened to where he
[39:35] says well I'll just throw the people out
[39:37] and you know whatever they go and if
[39:38] some of them's pretty good I'll just
[39:39] pick me out a few now I don't believe
[39:42] God done that amen I believe he had in
[39:45] his mind his attributes his thoughts
[39:49] right and we were there in his mind
[39:52] we'll get to that more later I've got it
[39:54] in the next message but I won't be able
[39:56] to get to it this evening but we had to
[39:58] be there in his mind or we'll never be
[40:00] there you know you're not pulling
[40:01] nothing over on God you're not going to
[40:03] get saved is a bad just said we won't
[40:05] have revivals because that way somebody
[40:07] might get saved that wasn't meant to be
[40:09] saved you know and that's pretty well
[40:11] the people of the message if I believe
[40:13] what the people of the message I'm
[40:15] talking about a big portion of the
[40:16] people of the message if I believe it
[40:18] that way I just quit and go home right I
[40:20] just go home forget it I wouldn't do
[40:22] nothing El why call I'm predestinated
[40:25] yeah I have eternal life yeah no matter
[40:29] what I do I'm going to
[40:31] heaven that's you know people get hate I
[40:35] mean get mad at you because you expose
[40:37] those things right but just remember I
[40:40] wasn't the one that come up with the
[40:42] doctrine you know right Paul said have I
[40:45] become your enemy because I tell you the
[40:48] truth you know he didn't want to tell it
[40:51] did he but he become an enemy to him
[40:54] okay so then we see as we've got right
[40:56] at the end of it talking about how that
[40:59] each age had a predestinated seed right
[41:03] all right now that was the word that was
[41:07] predestinated eternally right right now
[41:11] in talking about that we're still on The
[41:13] Germ of life cuz we didn't get to finish
[41:15] it but that seed had to be predestinated
[41:18] the prophet said 154 Church age book the
[41:21] seed or word come predestinated
[41:23] eternally from God all right
[41:27] see we look at it as being and it's fine
[41:29] to hold us until we get to the truth but
[41:32] we look it at as just well the seed is
[41:34] just you know here's mankind here's the
[41:37] world and God just
[41:39] goes and the seeds just fall you know
[41:43] and every who that fell on just happened
[41:45] to be you know well if he knew every
[41:49] that and every time it would bad it eye
[41:51] all of that I I don't think that's
[41:53] exactly the way it is you know and but
[41:56] see you're saying well well if you go
[41:59] anything further than for
[42:01] knowledge then you know you're making
[42:04] God a respector no I'm not right if he
[42:09] deals with everybody on Earth by for
[42:11] knowledge he's dealing with me and you
[42:13] by for
[42:14] knowledge he knows exactly what we'll
[42:17] do it's all dealt on for knowledge and
[42:21] he knew that before the world right but
[42:23] then his
[42:25] children
[42:27] are you going to tell him that he done
[42:34] wrong now I'm going to ask you that
[42:36] question over and over are you going to
[42:38] tell him that he done wrong by doing the
[42:40] way he done if you believe that they was
[42:42] happen to be a children of
[42:44] God well then I'm going to ask you where
[42:46] did the foolish virgin come in at where
[42:49] did all of those things and what about
[42:50] those people that's going to be given
[42:52] eternal life one day if you think he
[42:54] ain't a God of love and and
[42:57] cuz brother rown said it even who was it
[42:59] that was it Isaiah was supposed to come
[43:01] through which one of them was it
[43:03] supposed to come through the wound of of
[43:05] Eve
[43:06] right but said she didn't come I mean he
[43:10] didn't come that way and said but
[43:11] everybody he had to come right amen
[43:14] right why cuz he was a predestinated
[43:15] seed right see we you you and I the true
[43:18] seed of God right here today all of you
[43:21] know that are true seeds that are are
[43:22] born again Believers we should have come
[43:24] without this fall right
[43:27] but we
[43:29] didn't you know we should have come that
[43:31] way but we didn't we would have come
[43:33] through the wound of Eve right you say
[43:36] well how would that be done see then you
[43:37] can argue there you get tied up with
[43:39] that and you make a Doctrine out of it
[43:42] well it didn't matter how just let God
[43:44] let it be the way God would have done it
[43:46] but you say well it wasn't going to be
[43:47] that way I know it wasn't going to be
[43:49] that way right because in God at the
[43:51] same time he had a Healer and a savior
[43:53] and all of those attributes and he was
[43:55] going to see him displayed right so he
[43:58] allowed us to come down forgive me for
[44:01] blowing my nose but I'm
[44:03] sorry if it keeps running down you'd see
[44:06] more than you'd want me to blow it
[44:09] but all right but now
[44:14] listen get down to the seriousness of
[44:17] it can you see what I'm talking
[44:20] about now that see then each age would
[44:24] have a predestined ated word right right
[44:29] right all right amen just as each time
[44:31] in the Old Testament there was somebody
[44:34] stood out right I mean each writings it
[44:37] was always somebody stood out in a a a a
[44:41] way to uh you know to show that they
[44:45] were the seed of God back there but we
[44:49] found then that the problem was that
[44:51] they didn't
[44:53] have the Holy Ghost back there to be
[44:56] able to give that seed life so David
[44:58] would go right back even after he'd say
[45:01] I have hid Thy word in my heart that I
[45:03] might not sin against thee turn right
[45:05] back around and go back out and sin
[45:08] right because he had nothing to take
[45:10] those things away from him there was no
[45:13] ability he could be anointed yes but
[45:16] anointings is can be upon anointed
[45:19] ones huh but down inside the
[45:23] soul is where the life is that that's
[45:26] right all right so that's what David
[45:28] said in my soul in my heart not his
[45:32] stumping gizzard right see his heart his
[45:36] soul his being he longed for
[45:41] God and God looked down and saw that and
[45:43] he
[45:44] said he's a man after my own heart amen
[45:48] you mean a murderer adulterous all kind
[45:51] of things right but he said he's a man I
[45:55] my own heart
[45:56] you know he's the apple of my
[45:58] eye you he loved David didn't he you
[46:02] know why cuz David loved
[46:04] him they had a lot to do with it see for
[46:07] knowledge gets involved in a lot of
[46:08] things all right but now get to the
[46:10] point see see then coming into the New
[46:13] Testament you had the ability of the new
[46:16] birth
[46:19] coming and giving eternal life to that
[46:22] seed that's right all right which would
[46:25] not be in the old Testament see it
[46:26] wouldn't the ability back there to bring
[46:28] the seed to life they needed the rain
[46:29] but couldn't have it all right now
[46:32] brother brand let see spoke the word
[46:33] Original Seed he said there was 120
[46:35] Little Seeds laying in the upper room
[46:37] waiting on the rain to fall right you
[46:41] know all right see then you know without
[46:44] that as most people would say all we got
[46:47] to do just believe it we just take it by
[46:49] faith well you remember brother Bram
[46:51] emphasized that one of the disciples
[46:53] said we've been up here 78 days or how
[46:55] many days you know so let's just take it
[46:57] by faith in other words we already cast
[46:59] already cast out Devils heal the sick
[47:01] and all the thing and they thought they'
[47:03] just go right back and take that
[47:04] ministry right back up you know but it
[47:07] wouldn't
[47:08] work so they had to stay until the Holy
[47:11] Ghost came right all right but as I said
[47:13] this morning now then you got the people
[47:15] in the New
[47:17] Testament that to show just like the
[47:19] natural Israel was shown the people in
[47:22] the New Testament see claimed to be the
[47:25] children of of God right there's not a
[47:27] denomination there's not any kind of a
[47:29] thing that doesn't claim to be a child
[47:31] of God even Buddhist and Hindus Muslim
[47:33] whatever they all claim to be the
[47:35] children of
[47:36] God see and and in that but yet we see
[47:40] then down to that ages that there was a
[47:43] predestinated seed or word amen all
[47:47] right predestinated word to come forth
[47:50] for each age all right that was where we
[47:52] kind of left off at and I was giving you
[47:54] those quotes where brother around was
[47:56] talking
[47:57] about on the uh Church age Books San
[48:01] Church age 284 number three on your
[48:04] notes that's where we'll be starting
[48:05] from he talking about names being
[48:07] blotted out and all the different things
[48:09] and he said that great Royal
[48:12] seat they had to be we had to be chosen
[48:14] in him before the foundation of the
[48:16] world now why was we
[48:21] chosen to be chosen now I didn't bring
[48:24] this out but I want to Brak some message
[48:25] M on that if I can get back to
[48:28] it you think I'm dragging out a lot of
[48:30] things and I think I'm dragging out a
[48:32] lot of things then come find out I ain't
[48:33] dragging enough you and slowing down
[48:36] enough but see chosen in him means
[48:39] exactly what it
[48:41] is when he was chosen we
[48:45] chosen right that's that's simple isn't
[48:48] it to be chosen in him you know if I'd
[48:51] have been chosen in brother colie that
[48:52] means I had to be in brother collie
[48:55] right amen this is not choosing up sides
[48:58] on the ball team try to get the best
[49:00] players right no this is this is the
[49:03] word of God see and if we were chosen in
[49:06] him that means we had to be in him
[49:09] that's right then you say what brother
[49:11] Dale and I know I got it the message we
[49:14] wasn't Spirits we was nothing back there
[49:17] we was in his mind that's
[49:19] right but go back in there far enough to
[49:21] find out that he was a time when he was
[49:23] self-existing right all right now that
[49:26] self-existing is a very deceiving
[49:29] thought because most of our thoughts of
[49:31] self-existing means he existed totally
[49:35] alone you say well that's exactly right
[49:37] but if you wouldn't there in him that's
[49:39] right you never will be that's right
[49:41] amen so was there ever a time that he
[49:44] was our word our word self-existing
[49:48] well brother random you said
[49:52] amen how you going to do it got to get
[49:54] it down to us
[49:57] but there was there ever a time that he
[49:58] didn't have his
[50:01] attributes was there ever a time that he
[50:03] didn't have eternal life right you have
[50:07] eternal life today then that eternal
[50:09] life that you have had to be in
[50:11] him there is no two Eternal lives and
[50:14] all like
[50:15] that so then we have to be a part of him
[50:17] I don't think I think that's just he was
[50:19] the evening
[50:20] message I get so slow all right but he
[50:23] says on proving his word
[50:27] number four when you noce it he by for
[50:30] knowledge predestinated a seed for every
[50:34] age that would believe it you said well
[50:38] that's just for knowledge right but
[50:41] that's not just for knowledge it's for
[50:44] knowledge that he knew that where the
[50:46] seed would
[50:47] fall
[50:48] right because that's my emphasis was
[50:52] that if for knowledge is
[50:54] first
[50:56] all right if forn knowledge comes before
[51:01] predestination then forn knowledge would
[51:03] mean that there was somebody that had to
[51:05] have full knowledge we'll get to where
[51:07] the sons of God shouted for joy and all
[51:09] of that when we get to it we preached on
[51:10] it before but we'll bring it out you
[51:12] know if we get time if we don't we'll
[51:14] meet in the in the Rapture and we don't
[51:17] have to worry about it but we'll sure
[51:18] have a good something good to talk about
[51:20] amen you know see proving his word then
[51:22] paragraph 122 he goes on to say that he
[51:25] knows that seed will be there just at
[51:29] that
[51:30] time he said he predestinated a
[51:34] bride now the bride is not just
[51:37] predestinated by for
[51:40] knowledge the life we live upon this
[51:43] Earth where we're here is predestinated
[51:46] by for
[51:49] knowledge but you back up into
[51:52] eternity and you can go far enough back
[51:57] to be able to see what redeem means
[52:01] right right so you know we're going
[52:04] somewhere
[52:06] right but we got to get it in the right
[52:08] order all right so we've got down to
[52:10] this one this Rising the sun number six
[52:14] 65418 he said Don't Fear anymore forever
[52:17] ordained excuse me ever foreordained
[52:20] predestinated seed of God shall come to
[52:23] life when that light spreads across the
[52:26] Earth of the Glorious
[52:28] gospel he said it was in every age it'll
[52:32] bring forth the crop that God ordains it
[52:35] to do all right now so that's why we
[52:39] read in number three of your notes up
[52:40] there it talks about him being the Royal
[52:42] seed how that he was
[52:46] planted and see this New Testament
[52:48] Church is not me and
[52:50] you it's Jesus Christ in me and
[52:54] you but the seat of
[52:57] Christ is not just me and you it's not
[53:00] just me and you anointed see Christ
[53:03] anointed no it's Christ in you the hope
[53:05] of glory it's not anointing in you hope
[53:08] of glory see that doesn't mean that you
[53:10] say well Christ means the anointing well
[53:12] that's right it's a person that's
[53:14] anointed all right but it's Christ in
[53:18] you the hope of glory all right so then
[53:22] when we come down to it what are we
[53:24] looking at
[53:28] we're looking at what he said here on
[53:30] 152 of the church age book number seven
[53:32] on your
[53:37] notes he's talking about the thoughts of
[53:39] God and then how here we are coming to a
[53:42] conclusion as the Eternal logos God that
[53:45] was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus
[53:49] dwelt all the fullness of the godhead
[53:51] bodily and that Eternal one was the
[53:53] father manifest in flesh right all right
[53:57] now and thereby gain the title of
[54:01] son that's what made him was that he was
[54:04] in flesh upon the Earth with us and
[54:05] would be called a son right see now
[54:08] watch even so
[54:12] we are you listening Eternal in his
[54:18] thoughts in our
[54:21] term became the many membered spoken
[54:24] word SE
[54:25] right now what does it say in Psalms 139
[54:29] is that what it is in continuance was my
[54:32] members fashion when is not yet
[54:34] perfect the in continuance one after the
[54:38] other was my members fashioned all right
[54:41] so now looking at it see Eternal in his
[54:43] thoughts in our turn became the many
[54:45] membered spoken word seed manifest in
[54:48] flesh and those Eternal thoughts now
[54:51] manifest in flesh are the sons of God
[54:55] because his eternal thoughts coming into
[54:58] flesh made him a Son of
[55:01] God right the father manifest in flesh
[55:05] right they we're not children of Jesus
[55:08] that was a child of God that's right
[55:10] we're children of God were Sons and
[55:12] Daughters of God not Sons and Daughters
[55:14] of Jesus that was a Son of God that's
[55:17] right he hold it in a straight
[55:23] line then what he
[55:26] say even as we are
[55:29] soall we did not become seed by the
[55:36] rebirth and here's where everybody goes
[55:38] to with that quote see we always was and
[55:42] then they'll take quotes from brother
[55:43] brandham and all like that and what he
[55:44] said's
[55:46] right but I believe it needs to be put
[55:48] together in the right order or we'll get
[55:51] the wrong
[55:52] idea watch what he says now we did not
[55:55] become
[55:57] seed by the
[55:59] rebirth we were seed and there were
[56:03] reborn for only the elect can be
[56:07] reborn right
[56:11] no so
[56:13] then we did not become
[56:16] seed we came here with a seed in
[56:20] us
[56:23] right just as
[56:26] Abraham was the
[56:28] seed just as Isaac was a
[56:30] seed what were
[56:34] they they were the word for the hour
[56:38] they were living upon the Earth amen
[56:41] right is that not true with you and I
[56:43] yes now that seed is not that he's asked
[56:47] a question see is the New Birth the
[56:49] birth of the word you come here with or
[56:52] is it what you heard now it's got to be
[56:54] what you heard or else you're going to
[56:56] eliminate the ministry which you
[56:58] eliminate the prophet and you just go
[57:00] back to what I said this morning and
[57:01] just hey let's just have a good time CU
[57:03] we all going to heaven
[57:05] anyway now that's not scriptural that's
[57:08] right
[57:09] see all right but you see then what was
[57:15] it we did not become
[57:20] seed you had to have that seed before
[57:25] you could come to the word that's right
[57:27] amen but not a seed like a spot or a
[57:30] word down inside of you the last quote
[57:33] you have is whatever the little woman at
[57:35] the well she had
[57:37] representation from predestination she
[57:39] had representation of predestination all
[57:42] right by predestination God knew where
[57:44] the seed would
[57:46] land but he did have a seed and as I
[57:49] said he didn't just cast it out all over
[57:51] the world and well now everywhere of
[57:53] that land all just
[57:55] well that would make him choose
[57:57] him no but he had a plan and a purpose
[58:00] go to Christ and M your God
[58:01] reveal and he was going to see it
[58:05] achieve the prophet said
[58:07] right well that's that's that's exactly
[58:10] what them other brothers talking about
[58:11] seeds well did they approach it by for
[58:16] knowledge can they tie four knowledge in
[58:18] with it
[58:20] right just asking you a
[58:23] question to get you to see what we're
[58:26] talking about because the next part is
[58:28] what I like because we were seed is the
[58:31] reason we could be
[58:34] quickened in nonone seed there is
[58:37] nothing to Quicken that's right all
[58:40] right now what makes a natural seed be
[58:43] able to be quickened or you plant it it
[58:45] comes
[58:47] up it has to have the germ of life
[58:53] right all right
[58:56] now is that germ of
[58:59] life eternal
[59:03] no right no it's not right it can be
[59:10] destroyed if it would be possible I know
[59:13] you're going to say it's impossible but
[59:14] if it could be possible then
[59:17] uh well let me put it this way it was
[59:20] impossible in the Old Testament for them
[59:22] to have eternal life right
[59:25] cuz Jesus had not died yet all right so
[59:28] they had
[59:31] deceived but what was different about
[59:35] them they were the word for their day
[59:38] they received the word we'll get to it
[59:40] in a
[59:43] minute it's not just I'm a Christian
[59:47] right that's what people thinks it's
[59:49] just say well I'm a Christian well
[59:50] everybody in the world today
[59:52] Christians like Steven Wilson says ain't
[59:54] nobody going to hell they going to have
[59:55] to do away with
[59:57] it cuz everybody's going to
[59:59] heaven you know it might be because you
[1:00:02] PID the parking lot or something but you
[1:00:04] know or put a Pew in a church with your
[1:00:06] name on the side but you know it might
[1:00:07] be something like that but everybody's
[1:00:09] going to heaven well I don't agree with
[1:00:11] that exactly do
[1:00:12] you cuz we're going to get something on
[1:00:14] the next but now what is
[1:00:18] nonseed nonseed is a seed without the
[1:00:22] germ of life right
[1:00:25] right
[1:00:27] right as I said the prophet talked about
[1:00:29] them making a grain of corn that they
[1:00:32] could take it down and they can make
[1:00:33] corn flakes they could make cornbread
[1:00:35] out of it they could do everything you
[1:00:37] know all right and in doing that it
[1:00:41] looked exactly like but there only one
[1:00:43] problem it didn't have the germ of life
[1:00:46] now can you see the germ of life in a
[1:00:52] seat actually let me ask you SK even
[1:00:55] more I I don't know about this but I'm
[1:00:57] going to ask you the question can
[1:00:59] science find The Germ of
[1:01:03] life I I really don't know have can they
[1:01:06] can they go back in there with highed
[1:01:08] microscopes and go far enough to be able
[1:01:09] to find some germ of life I don't really
[1:01:11] know if they can it's all right if they
[1:01:13] can't it's all right my point is you
[1:01:16] can't see the germ of
[1:01:20] Life all right so then quit looking
[1:01:22] around at people you know to condemn
[1:01:26] them cuz they might have the germ of
[1:01:28] life and you might not have
[1:01:30] it all right good
[1:01:32] point okay but you see in
[1:01:38] nonseed
[1:01:41] now see we want to say nonseed is
[1:01:43] serpent
[1:01:48] seed
[1:01:50] now what happened with
[1:01:53] Judas
[1:01:57] right didn't Judas take the word of God
[1:02:01] y didn't he walk with the word of God
[1:02:04] didn't he have part of the
[1:02:08] Ministry Jesus never said you're N
[1:02:16] Seed what about
[1:02:18] Judas I serpent
[1:02:20] seed well then why did Jesus choose him
[1:02:23] to walk with him and allow him to walk
[1:02:26] close to
[1:02:28] him the Rich Young Ruler was he serpent
[1:02:34] seed when the Bible said Jesus loved
[1:02:37] him cuz he knew what he said was
[1:02:41] right he knew he had kept all those
[1:02:44] Commandments from his
[1:02:45] youth but see what is none
[1:02:50] seed wouldn't it be then that the
[1:02:53] natural Seed of
[1:02:55] Abraham I'm not talking about Isaac now
[1:02:58] hold point the natural Seed of
[1:03:02] Abraham the natural
[1:03:05] Israelite would be showing you the
[1:03:07] nonseed
[1:03:11] situation but Isaac would be showing you
[1:03:14] the germ of
[1:03:17] Life Jacob and
[1:03:19] Esau see Esau would be showing you the
[1:03:22] germ of life
[1:03:26] right
[1:03:28] see whereas Esau would not be having the
[1:03:30] germ of
[1:03:34] life cuz Esau was a whole lot better man
[1:03:37] than Jacob
[1:03:42] right but see it couldn't be dealt upon
[1:03:44] that because we read this morning we're
[1:03:47] talking about where that
[1:03:49] Jacob had the seed yep right Jac Jacob
[1:03:54] was a
[1:03:56] seed what seed the seed of
[1:03:59] Christ all right so now where are we
[1:04:06] here the only thing you could have from
[1:04:09] God would be the germ of
[1:04:14] life now when you get down to it and
[1:04:17] you're studying what brother brandom
[1:04:18] says and we will get those quotes he
[1:04:21] talks about he said you had a gene of
[1:04:23] eternal life
[1:04:29] now I'm not no
[1:04:31] scientist but I have read a little bit
[1:04:34] and you know I can make wrong statements
[1:04:36] but scientist doctors be sitting here
[1:04:38] they' know it's right see it's not a
[1:04:41] germ it's a gene Gene comes before a
[1:04:44] germ I know it can be translated back it
[1:04:46] and forth okay all right but basically
[1:04:49] you're a
[1:04:50] gene and then it comes out to be a
[1:04:53] germ
[1:04:55] see and that's the only way that a baby
[1:04:57] can be born see because you were a
[1:05:02] gene in your mother and
[1:05:04] father you know especially in your
[1:05:06] father but then one day through the
[1:05:08] bedding ground of
[1:05:11] wedlock it transferred from a gene into
[1:05:15] a germ and a germ into a sperm and that
[1:05:19] would bring forth the child see because
[1:05:22] of the connection of all right now said
[1:05:26] it ain't no doctor but I think that's
[1:05:29] right so
[1:05:32] then we were seed and could be
[1:05:37] reborn right
[1:05:40] see we were in God's mind before the
[1:05:44] world Amen right or we'll never be
[1:05:48] right and he said if you wasn't part of
[1:05:50] that word now I'm not giving these
[1:05:52] quotes I'll give them later sometimes
[1:05:53] when need them but if you need them man
[1:05:55] you're in bad shape as much as I
[1:05:57] preached around here about it most of
[1:05:59] you already to know probably the
[1:06:00] paragraphic comes from in the books you
[1:06:03] know but you
[1:06:05] see the word is not Eternal because you
[1:06:09] have it
[1:06:12] right now come
[1:06:14] on you have the new birth right amen am
[1:06:18] the new birth is the quickening of the
[1:06:19] word right that's right but do you know
[1:06:22] everything do you know every word no no
[1:06:25] then there's something wrong there ain't
[1:06:26] it
[1:06:29] right well I know everything the Holy
[1:06:32] Ghost didn't me knows everything does
[1:06:36] it I'm asking you a
[1:06:39] question brother Brown said the Holy
[1:06:41] Ghost is sitting in your soul waiting on
[1:06:42] you to bring him the word and he said
[1:06:44] when it's brought in it'll be quickened
[1:06:47] that's his way of saying it so you know
[1:06:49] don't get off on your big Ideas you know
[1:06:52] just be sensible
[1:06:56] see just take what he's
[1:07:00] saying if you were not
[1:07:03] seed you could never be reborn right
[1:07:07] right if you was not a part of God
[1:07:12] before the world you will never be a
[1:07:14] part of God
[1:07:16] right okay sensible so let's go on look
[1:07:20] at number eight which is this is from
[1:07:22] Christ the my God revealed look at which
[1:07:24] is PID 50 there's only way you'll know
[1:07:26] him today only way you'll get that
[1:07:29] three-fold revelation of God is for the
[1:07:30] Holy Ghost and the only way it can ever
[1:07:33] be is you're predestinated to see it
[1:07:38] right now uh hold that for a little
[1:07:43] because see every age is not
[1:07:46] predestinated to the same place right I
[1:07:50] don't want to choose to get on that much
[1:07:52] because we'll be on to adoption of
[1:07:54] eventually cuz this age is predestinated
[1:07:57] unto a full adoption amen right all
[1:08:00] right but every age before us was not
[1:08:02] predestinated for a full adoption so
[1:08:05] thereby the word of the other ages
[1:08:07] couldn't bring you to adoption that's
[1:08:09] right full adoption
[1:08:12] am it couldn't do it it didn't bring
[1:08:17] them The Headstone hadn't come yet to
[1:08:20] Prophet said so then hold off on that
[1:08:22] but see just keep it and remember what
[1:08:24] he's saying is you're predestinated to
[1:08:27] see
[1:08:30] it all
[1:08:32] right if you don't you'll never see it
[1:08:35] that's right if you're not predestinated
[1:08:38] to see it you'll never see it cuz that
[1:08:42] light can Flash and you'll go away and
[1:08:44] make fun of it and explain it away by
[1:08:46] some intellectual conception when the
[1:08:49] very God himself manifesting himself and
[1:08:51] proving it see but if it ain't upon you
[1:08:54] to see it you won't see it right now
[1:08:59] that's getting down to some
[1:09:00] predestination now see right cuz if it
[1:09:03] ain't preached to you how can you see
[1:09:09] it all right keep on
[1:09:13] reading God never said never just said
[1:09:16] I'll choose this one choose that one but
[1:09:19] he knew by his reason he could
[1:09:21] predestinate is because he's infinite
[1:09:24] and he he knows he's infinite so
[1:09:26] therefore he knowed everything he knowed
[1:09:29] the end he could tell the end from the
[1:09:31] beginning he's God if he can't do that
[1:09:34] he's not God that's it he's infinite all
[1:09:36] right now this is a continuation of
[1:09:37] reading right in Christ of mystery
[1:09:40] right John would have never known him no
[1:09:44] sir had the Holy Ghost not pointed
[1:09:48] out see how God hides his mystery to the
[1:09:52] highend educated in and everything look
[1:09:55] every one of them people saying and
[1:09:58] simplicity reveals it to whom he has
[1:10:01] predestinated to see it look at here
[1:10:05] others standing by and never see the
[1:10:07] dove
[1:10:09] sure they never heard no voice but it
[1:10:12] was only sent to the predestinated seed
[1:10:15] predestinated certainly he was
[1:10:16] predestinated for Isaiah um 712 years
[1:10:21] before he was born talking about John
[1:10:23] and the spirit raised up out of these
[1:10:25] human senses and said there's a voice
[1:10:27] one crying in the
[1:10:28] wilderness predestinated that Li Prophet
[1:10:31] to the ceiling of all the prophets of
[1:10:34] the Old
[1:10:35] Testament
[1:10:37] now everybody's not predestinated to see
[1:10:39] it that's right that's
[1:10:43] right that's why
[1:10:45] everybody in this message is not
[1:10:47] predestinated to come to the same place
[1:10:50] because it's the body of Christ there's
[1:10:53] no argument about who's predestinated to
[1:10:55] what it's just knowing that's truth so
[1:10:58] if you're not predestinated God is not
[1:10:59] obligated to lay the word in front of
[1:11:01] you where you could attain them to
[1:11:04] it that's why brother Dale don't throw
[1:11:06] off on people like they throw off on him
[1:11:08] see when I say something that old
[1:11:10] brother D he just gone he serpent se but
[1:11:13] see I I like to think everybody's got a
[1:11:15] place you know that's right that's place
[1:11:17] for them and they'll be what they're
[1:11:20] supposed to be I've never de
[1:11:22] christianized nobody I just leave it to
[1:11:24] that point we will show what we
[1:11:27] are all right see then that was would be
[1:11:29] no trouble but see there's a an age and
[1:11:32] a time look what he says now he cares do
[1:11:35] you care
[1:11:36] 1963
[1:11:38] 7:21 now he did that to the
[1:11:42] elect now we know that he did that to
[1:11:45] the elect only to the elect now they was
[1:11:49] the ones who had accepted this germ of
[1:11:52] life
[1:11:54] they were the ones who were
[1:11:56] predestinated to see
[1:11:59] it because why they could receive a germ
[1:12:03] of
[1:12:05] Life all
[1:12:07] right do we have the germ of
[1:12:13] Life we've heard the word right but have
[1:12:17] we made it a germ of
[1:12:22] life
[1:12:25] what if we made it right trying to find
[1:12:28] some
[1:12:29] scriptures
[1:12:34] anyhow what about the difference in
[1:12:37] Judas and
[1:12:41] Peter what was the
[1:12:46] difference one of them had the germ of
[1:12:49] Life the other one
[1:12:52] didn't what was the difference I'm
[1:12:54] trying to look down through but we might
[1:12:56] as well go ahead and read all the notes
[1:12:57] I got written up to there and we'll get
[1:12:58] to a point then we'll go over to to acts
[1:13:01] and take up our
[1:13:03] thought number 10 on your notes believ
[1:13:05] in God 1952 to
[1:13:10] 24 but plant of wheat he's talking about
[1:13:13] to take a handful of wheat laying down
[1:13:14] in my hand and lay it on this desk it
[1:13:16] would never be nothing but wheat laying
[1:13:20] there you say I've got the wheat I've
[1:13:22] got what about the life on it see but
[1:13:25] plant that wheat in the ground and it'll
[1:13:27] produce maybe a bushel of wheat you know
[1:13:29] one little grain that's what he's
[1:13:31] talking about see but the germ of life
[1:13:35] is in the
[1:13:37] wheat but the wheat has to fall into the
[1:13:40] ground and
[1:13:42] die Jesus said or Pauls I believe that
[1:13:45] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[1:13:47] ground and die it abides
[1:13:50] alone M and then this is God his
[1:13:57] word now what's God the word the whe
[1:14:00] right and when the word anchors down in
[1:14:03] the
[1:14:04] heart oh if I could get you to see it
[1:14:08] when that word anchors D it'll produce
[1:14:11] what I said y it'll do just you know
[1:14:15] it's God it has to all right let's go
[1:14:18] over now to
[1:14:22] Acts
[1:14:25] 8 it be a little ahead because all I
[1:14:27] want to do is read the scripture and get
[1:14:29] back to it go over to acts 8 and let's
[1:14:31] read
[1:14:35] it everybody knows when we get there you
[1:14:38] see what it is the Ethiopian unic go to
[1:14:41] verse
[1:14:42] 28 the Ethiopian
[1:14:44] unic all
[1:14:47] right verse
[1:14:48] 28 all
[1:14:51] right said he was returning and sitting
[1:14:54] in his
[1:14:55] Chariot
[1:14:58] read Isaiah the prophet now this is what
[1:15:01] the guy was doing he was sitting in his
[1:15:02] chur and he he read to Isaiah the
[1:15:05] prophet then the spirit said unto
[1:15:07] Phillip go near and join th to his CH
[1:15:10] this charot and Philip ran hither to him
[1:15:14] and heard him read the prophet isus and
[1:15:17] said understandest thou what thou
[1:15:21] readest now look at it
[1:15:24] he'd been up there to
[1:15:25] worship he'd been up there he knew the
[1:15:29] scriptures he was reading the
[1:15:33] scriptures
[1:15:35] see but yet look what he said and he
[1:15:38] said how can I understand except some
[1:15:42] man should guide
[1:15:44] me and he desired philli that he would
[1:15:46] come up and sit with him it gets into
[1:15:49] the scriptures with him now so you see
[1:15:52] what the Prophet is saying over here
[1:15:54] that we just
[1:15:57] read see it anchors down in there when
[1:15:59] you hear
[1:16:03] it you said what what it was always down
[1:16:05] in there was it always something down in
[1:16:08] there you know like a
[1:16:12] spot or was it a
[1:16:15] word that the man was able to comprehend
[1:16:19] look at the next one number 11 on your
[1:16:22] notes is your life worthy of the Gospel
[1:16:24] 63 6:30 the
[1:16:26] evening let's compare something one time
[1:16:29] of a life worthy let's compare the life
[1:16:32] of St Paul to the Rich Young
[1:16:35] Ruler now you know who the Rich Young
[1:16:37] Ruler was and what he was and Jesus
[1:16:38] loved him and all the same light struck
[1:16:41] both
[1:16:45] men now that's what your Prophet you
[1:16:48] argue with him now the same light struck
[1:16:51] both men
[1:16:54] both had the same invitation from Jesus
[1:16:58] Christ is that right they both was well
[1:17:02] trained in the
[1:17:04] scriptures they were both theologians
[1:17:07] remember Jesus told told the Rich Young
[1:17:09] Ruler keep the Commandments said I've
[1:17:12] done this from my youth he was a trained
[1:17:14] man so was St Paul both were well
[1:17:18] trained in the
[1:17:19] scriptures but both of them had the word
[1:17:26] okay one had it from a
[1:17:32] knowledge the other one had the germ of
[1:17:36] life in
[1:17:40] it
[1:17:44] no when that light flashed across it
[1:17:47] front of front of Paul he said who Lord
[1:17:50] who are you right
[1:17:54] Paul had the germ of
[1:17:57] Life remember the other night we were
[1:18:00] bringing it out that the germ can only
[1:18:02] well I've got it down the next I'm going
[1:18:03] down spoken words Original Seed 62
[1:18:06] 318 cuz he talking about the unic and
[1:18:09] Philip had been up to Pentecost
[1:18:11] Jerusalem to worship how many says Amen
[1:18:13] to that the unic he had been with all
[1:18:16] the DDS and LDS and everything but why
[1:18:19] didn't he get something he come back
[1:18:22] down studying the Prophecies of
[1:18:27] Isaiah although an angel directed philli
[1:18:30] to
[1:18:31] him but the germ of Life had to come
[1:18:33] through the body Philip oh brother now
[1:18:37] we're on the line where did The Germ
[1:18:41] come from through the
[1:18:43] angel angel couldn't do
[1:18:46] it the angel couldn't remember Gabriel
[1:18:48] delivered the message to Mary but it
[1:18:50] took the Holy Ghost to plant the seed
[1:18:54] Angel couldn't do it right the angel
[1:18:57] showed him where to go an angel is a
[1:19:01] messenger here's a son Philip had the
[1:19:03] germ the message the word that's how a
[1:19:07] child can be
[1:19:09] born what from the word the message
[1:19:12] Philip laid his hands upon Him Philip
[1:19:15] baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:19:17] they come up out of the water sure now
[1:19:19] The Germ had to come from the body what
[1:19:21] body Christ body correct and Philip was
[1:19:23] a member of the body all right
[1:19:31] now the Ethiopian unit he had the
[1:19:37] word but he had it by head
[1:19:43] knowledge Paul had it by
[1:19:46] germ you said
[1:19:49] when they both studied the word
[1:19:53] see I've always defended Paul on one
[1:20:00] thing and I've still never got a
[1:20:02] definite answer from anybody I've heard
[1:20:04] a lot of lot of definitions of where
[1:20:06] that Paul said you know he he was
[1:20:08] talking about the it's hard for thee to
[1:20:10] kick God did that Paul and said it's
[1:20:12] hard for thee to kick against the
[1:20:15] Pricks and see I've asked people about
[1:20:17] that and they give me the natural
[1:20:18] definitions because I know that I used
[1:20:20] to plow the mules and they put you
[1:20:23] know spikes back there we didn't have to
[1:20:25] do that but they kick the the double
[1:20:26] trees and single trees and it hurt their
[1:20:29] feet but in the them days they just put
[1:20:31] a spikes back there well that's
[1:20:32] everybody gives that answer that's good
[1:20:34] that's all right I'm not throwing off on
[1:20:35] nobody now I'm not saying nothing I'm
[1:20:37] just saying that it still hasn't given
[1:20:39] me the full concept of what God was
[1:20:43] saying to
[1:20:44] Paul Paul was a good
[1:20:48] man I believe that you call him a hook
[1:20:51] noosed Jew I agree with you but yet he
[1:20:55] was a good
[1:20:58] man I believe he
[1:21:01] was and see I believe God was saying to
[1:21:03] him Paul why are you doing these things
[1:21:05] you're
[1:21:10] doing you've heard about
[1:21:13] Christianity Paul had heard of it
[1:21:15] because he was out there killing them
[1:21:16] for what they believed he said you've
[1:21:18] killed a lot of these people and you've
[1:21:21] seen them people
[1:21:23] take death instead
[1:21:26] of turning against right God sure you
[1:21:31] cause some to blaspheme by rejecting
[1:21:35] it I said
[1:21:38] Paul it's hard for you to kick against
[1:21:40] the
[1:21:44] truth cuz the truth is you know what's
[1:21:47] going
[1:21:49] on you know them people wouldn't give
[1:21:51] their life for the
[1:21:53] gospel you remember who was it the stone
[1:21:56] Steven and Paul was holding his coat and
[1:21:58] brother R said that never did leave Paul
[1:22:01] right even after he become a Christian
[1:22:04] and went on to his own to death he
[1:22:06] wanted to die right that's what run said
[1:22:11] he said that never left him when he seen
[1:22:13] a man laying on the ground and him
[1:22:15] throwing stones on him and he's looked
[1:22:16] up and he said father forgive
[1:22:20] him Paul might not have been there when
[1:22:22] Jesus was crucified to hear those words
[1:22:25] but surely he heard them from a lot of
[1:22:28] people that told
[1:22:30] him it's hard for you Paul
[1:22:33] to go against these
[1:22:37] things it's hard for you
[1:22:39] to turn down the
[1:22:43] truth and see that was The Germ that was
[1:22:46] in in
[1:22:49] Paul not because of the letter of the
[1:22:51] word that he had had planted
[1:22:55] because the Ethiopian unit had
[1:22:58] it now the Ethiopian unit went on anded
[1:23:01] it proving he had it but the Rich Young
[1:23:02] Ruler had it and proved it wasn't so the
[1:23:05] Rich Young Ruler had it by head
[1:23:07] knowledge
[1:23:10] all Paul had it by The Germ of
[1:23:17] Life can't you think of after becoming a
[1:23:21] Christian you know
[1:23:24] and to go back through your life and
[1:23:25] remember the things of
[1:23:27] life that's
[1:23:31] right I told you I wasn't a Christian I
[1:23:34] mean I was a nominal Christian okay I
[1:23:37] believe I come to sanctification I
[1:23:39] believe
[1:23:42] that but I wasn't a born again Christian
[1:23:45] until after come in this message about 2
[1:23:46] years after being in the message before
[1:23:49] I receive the new
[1:23:51] birth but yet at 11 years old I saw God
[1:23:55] standing in a
[1:23:57] church not as a human being form and all
[1:24:00] but just the knowledge of where he was
[1:24:03] and from that day on I wanted to find
[1:24:06] what that was and I talked to people
[1:24:08] about it and they tell me say you need
[1:24:09] to go to a Pentecostal church cuz they
[1:24:12] you know that was more in the realm and
[1:24:16] uh just telling myself you know my story
[1:24:19] that you've heard thousands of times
[1:24:21] already
[1:24:24] but what would be the germ of
[1:24:32] life and then when I began to read the
[1:24:34] Bible after joining the Baptist Church
[1:24:36] in 58 my wife was a Christian I wasn't
[1:24:40] and uh I joined the Baptist Church and I
[1:24:42] told her I said well I guess I need to
[1:24:44] read the
[1:24:45] Bible I began to read
[1:24:47] it and I read all of that and so and so
[1:24:50] we got so and so and so and so got so
[1:24:52] and so so and so and so we got so and so
[1:24:53] I read every bit of that so and so
[1:24:56] because I realized it could be and I
[1:24:58] found a lot of things right in the
[1:24:59] middle of so and so we got so and so I'd
[1:25:01] find a good key key verse you know that
[1:25:03] would really emphasize it so don't get
[1:25:06] tired of reading the Bible when you get
[1:25:07] into that but see in the Baptist you had
[1:25:09] to get that gold star from being able to
[1:25:12] say you'd read the Bible Well if I left
[1:25:15] out so and so we got sh and so I
[1:25:17] wouldn't have read the whole Bible all
[1:25:19] right but see I
[1:25:22] as going through then I come to Malachi
[1:25:24] 3 and I come to Malachi 4 and you've
[1:25:26] heard this over and over so it's not a
[1:25:27] new thing and I told my wife I said the
[1:25:30] way I see it before the end of the world
[1:25:32] comes there's going to be two prophets
[1:25:36] come cuz I can see that's what the
[1:25:38] scripture
[1:25:40] said so when brother Mo began to talk to
[1:25:42] me about a prophet in the end time I
[1:25:44] said we in the
[1:25:46] Bible he said Malachi
[1:25:49] 4 and he could qu it to me now I I said
[1:25:52] well okay who's this guy over here in
[1:25:54] Malachi
[1:25:56] 3 he said well that was John the Baptist
[1:25:58] and then he took it Luke 11:17 he took
[1:26:00] it right through the scriptures and he
[1:26:01] just fixed it up there and there it
[1:26:03] was see well now see that scripture is
[1:26:07] more important to me than any scripture
[1:26:09] in the Bible right don't you have
[1:26:12] certain scriptures that are more
[1:26:13] valuable more more closely related to
[1:26:16] you right that one is to me you know
[1:26:20] maybe it you must be born again maybe
[1:26:21] something you know
[1:26:22] but that was I think Wade what is it
[1:26:25] Genesis 26 and 27 is Wade scripture all
[1:26:29] right see maybe that has something to do
[1:26:31] with us personally right that God knew
[1:26:35] that and that would be your
[1:26:37] foration you say well then is it a
[1:26:40] scripture laying there no it wasn't a
[1:26:41] scripture laying there I had to read
[1:26:44] it I had to read the
[1:26:47] Bible you have to read the Bible before
[1:26:50] it can be in you you're not something
[1:26:52] that brother randam wasn't that God just
[1:26:54] whacked off his head
[1:26:55] and closed it up and he had all the
[1:26:58] word no he studied it
[1:27:02] amen he was even wrong and would take
[1:27:05] correction from the word of God uhuh
[1:27:09] right see but what was that
[1:27:12] word see some little spark of life
[1:27:16] right some little something that relates
[1:27:18] you to Jesus Christ am you can't
[1:27:21] remember the
[1:27:22] things see so this Ethiopian
[1:27:26] unic he couldn't get it himself that's
[1:27:30] right so he needed somebody to teach
[1:27:35] him I didn't write in the Bible that the
[1:27:38] 5old Ministries for the perfecting of
[1:27:39] the Saints right I didn't write that and
[1:27:42] I didn't write in there where Paul said
[1:27:44] in the Corinthians letter that how can
[1:27:46] we hear without a preacher and how can
[1:27:47] he preach unless he be sin I didn't
[1:27:49] write them scriptures right but I do
[1:27:52] believe them you know I believe it's
[1:27:55] true you say well well brother Dale you
[1:27:58] do away with me no I I encourage I beg I
[1:28:01] plead with you to read and study the
[1:28:04] message the Bible and the
[1:28:06] things don't just depend upon me
[1:28:08] bringing it to you cuz you know read it
[1:28:12] and study it I encourage that I'm not
[1:28:16] like the man told Brother Mo said you
[1:28:18] let them people have the books and
[1:28:19] they'll know as much as you do well I
[1:28:21] want you to know much as I do that's
[1:28:23] what I want you to know it's as much as
[1:28:25] I do and then more than I do where you
[1:28:28] can help me you know I want you to do
[1:28:31] that but see that that unic then
[1:28:36] once
[1:28:37] Phillip
[1:28:39] expounded
[1:28:42] upon what he was
[1:28:47] reading is this man speaking of himself
[1:28:49] or is he speaking of another see yeah
[1:28:53] and once he expounds upon those
[1:28:56] things then the unic receiv received
[1:28:59] water baptism and the baptism of the
[1:29:01] Holy Ghost and went down to Ethiopia and
[1:29:03] converted that whole part of the country
[1:29:06] there from that and that's what a lot of
[1:29:09] people don't
[1:29:11] like cuz this thing ain't natural in the
[1:29:15] Ethiopian unit was a
[1:29:17] unic
[1:29:19] right but it don't make no difference he
[1:29:22] was in the body of Christ and could
[1:29:23] carry the seed so there not that
[1:29:27] kind well bless God he can't carry the
[1:29:29] seed like a brother told me one time
[1:29:32] about brother he said he can't
[1:29:36] preach he ain't married you got to be
[1:29:38] mad to preach I said well Jesus missed
[1:29:40] it I
[1:29:44] guess I know that's right sorry
[1:29:47] sarcastic you know I can't help it if
[1:29:50] it's laying there brother said I told
[1:29:53] you he'd bring you a quote for it but I
[1:29:56] can't help it if I studied the message
[1:29:58] for 40 something years and if you
[1:30:00] studied one message 40 something years
[1:30:02] you ought to know a few
[1:30:04] answers you know you don't hear that
[1:30:06] anymore but boy back in the in the late
[1:30:08] 60s and early' 70s what was it beware of
[1:30:11] them that have all the
[1:30:14] answers
[1:30:16] intellectualism well I cond to phrase
[1:30:20] you know beware of them that don't have
[1:30:21] any
[1:30:25] answers cuz if you got a lot of answers
[1:30:27] at least some of them can be right you
[1:30:29] got no answers you have nothing that's
[1:30:32] sensible but now think about
[1:30:35] it what was it that they
[1:30:42] had let's read this one number 13 on
[1:30:45] your notes things that are to
[1:30:47] be 65 1205 he's talking about the word
[1:30:51] as you're looking Looking Glass and
[1:30:52] coming down and he saying and make that
[1:30:55] an altar cu the altar is sitting full of
[1:30:57] people and make that an altar another
[1:30:59] words your own self don't worry about it
[1:31:01] there in the chair where you're sitting
[1:31:04] make that heart of yours heart of theirs
[1:31:07] the altar he's praying about it see May
[1:31:10] the world move off from ever brother
[1:31:14] sister in here and may that little germ
[1:31:17] of life that Gene of God that we just
[1:31:22] talked about that
[1:31:25] attribute that come down from God and
[1:31:28] has been manifested here to honor and
[1:31:30] glorify God God moved the world from
[1:31:38] them may that little germ
[1:31:41] Jean that we talked about that
[1:31:45] attribute see when brother brandom will
[1:31:47] say you always was eternal and check
[1:31:49] what he's saying he said the eternal
[1:31:51] life to that you have cuz you have
[1:31:53] eternal life you always was
[1:31:56] eternal that's
[1:31:58] sensible there was a day I didn't have
[1:32:00] eternal life and there was a day I did
[1:32:02] what gets me as the people of the
[1:32:03] message on the other part of it that
[1:32:05] I've actually heard them preach great
[1:32:07] messages and things I'm not throwing off
[1:32:09] but I've heard him preach that then I've
[1:32:10] heard him preach that Jesus didn't even
[1:32:12] have eternal life he had to receive it
[1:32:14] on the River
[1:32:16] Jordan well that me he was no part of
[1:32:18] God that's
[1:32:20] right that's s
[1:32:23] let need a big light bu turned
[1:32:25] on he wouldn't no part of God if he
[1:32:28] didn't have God's own life at his birth
[1:32:30] am then the Bible said he's born Lord to
[1:32:32] Christ but now let's take just the two
[1:32:35] quotes that I've quoted a lot the future
[1:32:37] home 1964 802 and let's talk about the
[1:32:41] little woman
[1:32:42] there that Jesus was talking
[1:32:47] to he talking about how that
[1:32:50] the well you say well look at this
[1:32:53] priest wasn't he a Son of God it proved
[1:32:56] he
[1:32:57] wasn't he couldn't recognize
[1:33:01] what now what he couldn't recognize what
[1:33:04] did he say I believe the Bible sure but
[1:33:07] he couldn't recognize the expressed word
[1:33:10] of the hour right he only had an
[1:33:12] intellectual learning from some group
[1:33:16] that been back before him and it's the
[1:33:18] same thing today see I know that strong
[1:33:21] but it's the truth there was a word
[1:33:24] that's spoken exactly for the day for
[1:33:27] that
[1:33:28] day and yet and he yet he was a scholar
[1:33:33] yet he was a renowned person but he
[1:33:35] could not recognize it why no matter how
[1:33:38] scholarly he was anything like that he
[1:33:41] still didn't have
[1:33:43] representation of
[1:33:48] predestination now what is
[1:33:50] predestination d Desy determined
[1:33:53] beforehand in other words he wasn't a
[1:33:55] part of
[1:33:57] God okay that sense will not to say
[1:34:00] right and you can only do it because
[1:34:02] look it proves predestination cuz if you
[1:34:05] got eternal
[1:34:07] life you had to be a part of God all
[1:34:10] times cuz he's the only one that's
[1:34:16] Eternal if you have eternal life you had
[1:34:19] to be a part of God right so the little
[1:34:21] woman there she was part of
[1:34:24] God
[1:34:26] what living in a garbage can out in the
[1:34:29] world and going
[1:34:31] wrong but she had
[1:34:34] predestination she had representation
[1:34:37] that's right now if you read all of up
[1:34:39] and down on that you'll find brother ROM
[1:34:40] telling you that that priest didn't have
[1:34:43] representation that's right he wasn't
[1:34:46] back there in
[1:34:48] God but yet he was a renowned known
[1:34:52] scholar had the word to the
[1:34:56] letter
[1:34:58] huh sure the only thing he missed was
[1:35:01] the word made alive right rest of it he
[1:35:04] understood now look at the next one
[1:35:06] proving his word 1964 816 that was 802
[1:35:10] 64 the future home you read all the way
[1:35:13] down CU you know what it says and was it
[1:35:15] Jerusalem the Jews and things why he
[1:35:17] said you've told the truth because
[1:35:19] you've had five and the one you now have
[1:35:21] is not your husband see watch something
[1:35:24] happened see something took
[1:35:29] life now if it hadn't been if it hadn't
[1:35:34] have been in there to begin with it she
[1:35:37] hadn't have had
[1:35:40] representation from
[1:35:43] predestination it take it never took
[1:35:47] hold see she had the germ of life
[1:35:53] and what is the germ of
[1:35:56] life okay we'll get to it on the next
[1:35:59] message cuz I'm trying to get that
[1:36:01] scripture in my mind I know it's I got
[1:36:02] in the next message but we'll get to it
[1:36:05] more of
[1:36:06] studying of how that people would come
[1:36:09] to
[1:36:10] things and how come that you you would
[1:36:12] come to something and the the person
[1:36:15] next to you not receive it right and how
[1:36:18] come it is
[1:36:20] especially
[1:36:22] in this message that you even find now
[1:36:24] that preachers are just falling by the
[1:36:26] wayside that have followed this message
[1:36:28] for 30 40 years preach this
[1:36:31] message and now they're falling by the
[1:36:37] wayside what about the people that you
[1:36:40] know and remember that's been in the
[1:36:42] message since you were in the message
[1:36:44] and where are they
[1:36:48] today brother Ray has a good memory talk
[1:36:50] to him sometime
[1:36:52] about a lot of the
[1:36:54] people that he and I used to know that
[1:36:58] you love them that you just you know you
[1:37:01] think that they would
[1:37:03] never in no
[1:37:05] way some of the people not talking about
[1:37:07] brother mol and them now but some of the
[1:37:09] people that actually were were
[1:37:11] instrumental into bringing us into the
[1:37:13] message are no longer in the
[1:37:17] message the ones that were there when we
[1:37:19] were at our beginning that were really
[1:37:22] on fire see that just rejected
[1:37:26] everything seemingly to be able to try
[1:37:29] in some
[1:37:30] way help
[1:37:33] you you know
[1:37:36] right went to Jeffersonville rode at
[1:37:39] that time you know he'll tell you listen
[1:37:42] to brother random people that rode from
[1:37:45] Georgia all the way to Jeffersonville
[1:37:46] just for a
[1:37:47] meeting you know and right on up Beyond
[1:37:51] Way Beyond go to other meetings and
[1:37:52] things like that you know but where are
[1:37:55] they
[1:38:04] today would it be that they never had
[1:38:06] the germ of
[1:38:11] life now what is the germ of Life
[1:38:14] brother
[1:38:15] Dale to me the germ of life is the fact
[1:38:21] that eternal
[1:38:23] life why we don't believe in Eternal
[1:38:25] sunship I can come back into the message
[1:38:28] where it was before on this we don't
[1:38:29] believe in Eternal sunship
[1:38:33] right Jesus was an was not an eternal
[1:38:36] Son of God cuz you can't have a son of
[1:38:39] God
[1:38:39] Eternal now you can have God I read you
[1:38:43] either this morning or this evening one
[1:38:44] manifested as a
[1:38:46] son and that can be Eternal right all
[1:38:49] right right God manifested as a son can
[1:38:52] be Eternal but you don't have eternal
[1:38:54] sunship
[1:38:55] right so God manifested In You by the
[1:38:59] new
[1:39:00] birth is eternal
[1:39:03] life and that's not a son of Jesus that
[1:39:06] was a Son of God so who are you sure we
[1:39:10] call ourselves we are the children of
[1:39:12] God we
[1:39:14] are the sons and daughters of God Amen
[1:39:17] that's all right but really the correct
[1:39:19] way is to say I'm God made manifest in
[1:39:21] another form called a
[1:39:25] son because we're his offspring that's
[1:39:28] what Paul said there I was trying to
[1:39:30] think of a minute ago to them on Mars
[1:39:33] Hill he said this unknown God you guys
[1:39:36] have got to place up here far I'd like
[1:39:38] to tell you about it and said you even
[1:39:40] your poets
[1:39:43] say that we are The Offspring of
[1:39:50] God
[1:39:51] we are the children of God what is the
[1:39:54] germ of
[1:39:55] life that God before the
[1:39:59] world not just had you in his mind as to
[1:40:02] come down because had Judas in his
[1:40:05] mind
[1:40:07] right but back up in his mind I told you
[1:40:10] before I don't want to necessarily be in
[1:40:12] the mind of God cuz I could be a
[1:40:15] Judas I want to be the mind of God
[1:40:18] displayed upon
[1:40:19] Earth
[1:40:22] I want to be eternal life
[1:40:25] displayed and I want you to have it cuz
[1:40:28] like I've always said it's the only
[1:40:30] thing that I really want to give away
[1:40:32] right and I don't want to do it you know
[1:40:35] what I'm saying but eternal life is the
[1:40:36] one thing that I've tried to my best to
[1:40:38] give away cuz I do it every day in the
[1:40:41] services and things trying to express it
[1:40:43] to you to see about the God that I'm
[1:40:45] talking about right amen cuz I believe
[1:40:48] then that the germ has to come through
[1:40:50] the body amen
[1:40:51] well that don't look like you put
[1:40:53] nothing in
[1:40:54] there you just missed the whole
[1:40:59] thing then when brother Brown says you
[1:41:02] always was
[1:41:03] eternal I have no problem
[1:41:08] right if I could take that bench right
[1:41:11] there and give it eternal
[1:41:14] life that's what we're thinking it's
[1:41:16] just something give you know we can just
[1:41:18] just goe just give it to it just give it
[1:41:20] eternal life you know no that's totally
[1:41:31] impossible because to be Eternal means
[1:41:34] you got to be a part of
[1:41:35] God
[1:41:37] now you may think you've trapped me okay
[1:41:40] let's see if you have I don't mean here
[1:41:42] necessarily cuz it's going out
[1:41:44] everywhere what about the foolish virgin
[1:41:47] they'll be given eternal life won't they
[1:41:49] that's right they don't have eternal
[1:41:51] life but it ain't like that bench no
[1:41:54] right God's for knowledge knew exactly
[1:41:58] where that foolish virgin would land and
[1:42:00] if anybody is ever given eternal life
[1:42:03] that eternal life they're given is a
[1:42:05] part of the life of
[1:42:09] God all right that's a part of the life
[1:42:11] of God the problem is it just like
[1:42:15] Israel they didn't receive their Earth
[1:42:18] here they rejected sunship
[1:42:21] right right they turned it down so we
[1:42:24] could receive it but one day when we're
[1:42:27] finished up then they'll receive
[1:42:30] it and they'll be made Eternal that's
[1:42:33] all in God's
[1:42:35] plan but the germ of
[1:42:38] God is not some kind of a something that
[1:42:42] you know and I know I know what brother
[1:42:44] Brown said said the soul maybe the inch
[1:42:47] square compartment in your heart is the
[1:42:50] Abode of the Soul you know that science
[1:42:52] is technology and him expressing it as
[1:42:55] to a point that that's you know that's
[1:42:58] what they think about it and he says
[1:43:01] could it
[1:43:02] be could it
[1:43:04] be the abod of the Soul now do you think
[1:43:07] your soul then is just one little thing
[1:43:09] little inch our compartment no we'll get
[1:43:12] to it eventually your soul is your being
[1:43:15] that's what you are that's right and
[1:43:18] it's not just an anointing of a spirit
[1:43:20] right
[1:43:22] you are a
[1:43:24] person and God is a person then brother
[1:43:27] Brandon says it he said by the new birth
[1:43:30] you and God become together as
[1:43:33] persons now he didn't mind saying
[1:43:38] that well what do we have the life of
[1:43:40] God what is the germ of God then brother
[1:43:42] Dale the
[1:43:45] representation from the predestination
[1:43:48] of God Amen that would allow him to look
[1:43:51] all the way down yes and see who would
[1:43:53] be what that's all right that's good
[1:43:55] that's for
[1:43:56] knowledge but the germ of
[1:43:59] life is that part of you that can come
[1:44:05] alive thank God for it that's right amen
[1:44:10] thank God for the
[1:44:11] ability to do it and don't worry about
[1:44:14] it if you don't have the germ of life
[1:44:15] you will never be born again right but
[1:44:18] if you desire to be born again
[1:44:22] then you got a good
[1:44:24] hope so then if you D up and say well
[1:44:26] God predestinated so it don't matter I
[1:44:28] just be what I
[1:44:30] am
[1:44:32] well I've always told
[1:44:34] you I love
[1:44:37] God if he wanted me to be an antichrist
[1:44:40] I want to be a good one
[1:44:43] right right cuz I love
[1:44:46] him do you love him that
[1:44:49] way do you love him to be able to the
[1:44:51] fact brother Brown said The Prostitute
[1:44:53] would walk across the platform and God
[1:44:55] at judgment and never look
[1:44:58] up but religious hypocritical Pharisees
[1:45:02] will come up and say have not I done all
[1:45:04] of these
[1:45:05] things look at me you was there when I
[1:45:09] done
[1:45:10] it you say depart from me I never knew
[1:45:13] you knew there as brother dick says
[1:45:16] means to be
[1:45:19] pregnant with a
[1:45:21] word he never knew it a relationship
[1:45:24] that's right right we're supposed to be
[1:45:27] children of God by relationship not
[1:45:30] intercourse right but by a new birth
[1:45:33] that's right the birth of the word let's
[1:45:35] Stand Together come on that's right
[1:45:37] think on these things The Germ of
[1:45:40] Life we'll go out this spring and we'll
[1:45:43] plant some corn beans potatoes
[1:45:46] Etc if that germ of life is not in there
[1:45:49] it don't make no difference right
[1:45:51] now you tell me that God doesn't know
[1:45:53] what he's doing and let me just Express
[1:45:55] what brother brandham said as I said a
[1:45:58] while ago in the he said like in the
[1:46:00] birth of a little
[1:46:03] calf he
[1:46:05] said that there's millions of
[1:46:08] eggs and millions of
[1:46:11] germs now you go back let's see I
[1:46:14] believe it's invisible
[1:46:17] union he says it like this
[1:46:20] he said see all of them was
[1:46:24] alive you know that every one of them
[1:46:27] little wiggle Tails as we call
[1:46:30] them would be capable of producing a
[1:46:34] another cave
[1:46:35] sure if he just went through the right
[1:46:38] process see we think one of them is all
[1:46:40] alive no one of them was chosen to live
[1:46:44] the others was alive but
[1:46:47] died right cuz that's God's
[1:46:51] predestination he said how come you
[1:46:52] wound up to be
[1:46:54] redheaded and all your families behind
[1:46:57] you was all blackheaded or blonde headed
[1:46:59] or something he said keep on checking
[1:47:01] you'll find out great great great great
[1:47:03] great grandmother back there cuz that's
[1:47:05] what the people of the message don't
[1:47:06] even realize you inherit from your
[1:47:08] mother cuz the egg that she produces is
[1:47:10] what brings the body that's right and
[1:47:13] you can look exactly like your
[1:47:15] mother it's the bloodstream that comes
[1:47:18] from the
[1:47:19] father
[1:47:21] and you can look exactly like your
[1:47:22] mother and you can run the DNA all the
[1:47:24] way back through the
[1:47:26] mother to find out whether or not it
[1:47:29] matches we just don't study enough D go
[1:47:32] ahead brother dick what we got 341 in
[1:47:34] the red
[1:47:37] book let's start off with the
[1:47:40] verse Satan like a roaring my inory to

[1:51:21] sick unless yall recover said pray the
[1:51:23] prayer of faith even if they've
[1:51:25] committed any sin said it be forgiven so
[1:51:28] we believe you Lord and we just lay
[1:51:29] everything aside and put it right on the
[1:51:31] word of God to believe and we thank you
[1:51:34] for then in Jesus name
[1:51:45] amen into the

[1:52:36] I'm Healed whatever I have need
[1:52:38] of that's the only way I get anything is
[1:52:41] the way I go to
[1:52:42] goder is
[1:52:45] he I don't just pray one prayer and then
[1:52:48] quit and that's good because we ought to
[1:52:51] pray and believe it right but sometimes
[1:52:54] we don't believe it so we keep praying
[1:52:56] until we believe
[1:52:58] it I don't have no trouble saying
[1:53:01] that faith is the substance of things
[1:53:04] far but there's a lot of difference in
[1:53:06] my faith and God's
[1:53:09] faith when God's faith come I don't pray
[1:53:12] no more because it's finished but until
[1:53:14] that time comes I pray and I
[1:53:18] believe
[1:53:31] our sister said she had a headache but
[1:53:32] it's
[1:53:35] gone we believe
[1:53:37] it just take the
[1:53:39] word believe it say thank
[1:53:45] you with the power greater than let's
