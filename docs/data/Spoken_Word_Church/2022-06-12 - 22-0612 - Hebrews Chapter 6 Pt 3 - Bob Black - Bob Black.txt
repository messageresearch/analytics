========================================

god bless you saints you happy to be in church this morning like that song says i woke up this morning feeling fine i woke up with heaven on my mind we've been studying on uh hebrews chapter six and the whole book of hebrews and we've about made it to about made it halfway through uh chapter six so we'll see if we can if we can finish today lord jesus we just ask you lord to bless the reading of your word and our study this morning bless brother wade as he studied preparing back there lord and we'd like we'd ask lord that you'll just answer every need this this morning lord as we come expected and we pray in the name of the lord jesus amen so hebrews chapter six and really hebrews chapter six is talking about anointed ones and those that uh turn back and begin to strike at the word um so hebrews chapter 6 says for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and we're made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they should fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame for the earth which strengtheneth in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from god but but that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected and is nigh into cursing whose end is to be burned so paul is talking about he's laying out a scene that we can uh if you just kind of picture that in your mind of of rain falling on the earth and and um and and it brings up different kinds of seeds that been planted all the different kinds of seeds benefit thorns and briars and then the true seed that's been planted but uh it the ones that have that you're going to have some that that that actually come to church and and benefit with the of the holy ghost falling on the people and and they they tasted the word and they they they they benefit from it and they but yet there's there's they don't continue on to the holy ghost so if you if you fall away from that if you turn back and begin to strike back at it and say brother branham's not right and the the messenger from the for the day is not right and those kind of things how can you how can you you actually are crucifying god afresh by ref rejecting the word for your day so how how can uh how can you be if you fall away to renew them against it would be impossible to renew them again to repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the very thing you're crucifying the very thing that would save you and put him to an open shame so brother brown when the message anointed once he talked about you know both but you got brain falling on all these different kinds of people both partake of the same nourishment water and sun both prayed now you think about that both prayed both like like balaam all these examples in in the bible balaam had all the different sacrifices he was it looked like he was doing the same thing cain looked like he was a good religious person both particular the same nourishment water and sun both prayed both received help from god for he maketh his son and reign to fall on both good and evil and though they both had the same wonderful blessing and both had the same wonderful manifestations that will steal that one great difference they were of different seed so the seed is what makes the difference and and in matthew chapter 13 we last time we kind of looked at that parable of the sower that that the the word is sown and and and received in different ways the sun will burn it out and you know somebody will that all the cares of life will choke it out and but if you just hang on to that word and receive it in good ground ground that sometimes is god will get you to a spot where you get that you get take he'll take you to a valley where you you do a a valley of desperation where you begin to realize that something's got to take place in my life i'm tired of the situation that i'm at so jesus is saying that he that receiveth great seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth seven hundredfolds some sixty some thirty and understanding doesn't necessarily mean just with your intellectual mind but understanding this kind of understanding i believe comes from from actually a relationship with jesus christ where he reveals to you what the word is speaking and you don't read it the word necessarily like a newspaper anymore but you're reading it like a love letter where you read between the lines where you read the story of abraham and sarah and you began to read between the lines and see how that their body was changed back and you begin to read between the lines and you begin to understand that all all these all these mysteries that are that are laying there in the bible but you begin to get the sense of it the essence of what the gospel is and how can you get the essence of it unless you have a relationship with christ christ is our absolute he's the one that we're our rock and our foundation and he's the one if you've got if you've got the author of the bible in you he will give you the understanding and give you the sense of what you're reading so you see see the difference is the seed the difference is the seed the revelation of what the bible is about the revelation and the revelation comes by receiving that word and hanging on to it until god can make it manifest in your life so brother brown would say uh or actually this this is the bible jesus jesus said in matthew chapter 7 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven not everybody that goes to church and cast out devils and preaches the gospel not everybody but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven and the will is the word which means the word is that seed so he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven the will now see if you're walking in the word and you're doing the will of the father then that means that your your life begins to match up right see how it's all tied together with if you have a revelation then acts your works will begin to follow you're going to go to church you're going to pay your tithes you're going to do the things that are required you're going to be baptized the right way you're going to outwardly demonstrate the faith that's on the inside that you have received because the word is becoming real to you so he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name i've cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then i will prophesy profess unto them i never knew you i never have a relationship with you i i never i i never revealed myself to you because you didn't receive my word depart from me you that work iniquity therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and do with them i will liken unto him like him liking him unto a wise man which built his south house upon a rock right there which built his house upon a rock and the rock is the revelation of jesus christ now now you notice in verse 23 it says i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so there's really the problem that we're gonna we're gonna uh maybe take a brief diversion into this uh into into what iniquity means here in just a second and the pergament church age brother and said and there it is you can't claim that manifestation is the evidence of being spirit born spirit-filled no sir i will admit that true manifestation is the evidence of the holy spirit doing mighty acts but it is not the evidence of the individual being spirit-filled even though that individual has an abundance of those manifestations now isn't that interesting that just because you come to church and shout and rejoice and run up and down the aisles that that that's good but that is not the evidence the evidence is that you've received the word for your day and it's manifested in your life with acts following what kind of acts virtue temperance knowledge patience the same kind of acts that were demonstrated in jesus's life because when you believe and it's bottled up on the inside you sooner or later it's going to work itself out and you're going to demonstrate those same acts of a believer you're going to be in church and paying your tithes and doing what a believer does because a believer if christ is living on the inside of you then it can't help but manifest the evidence of receiving the holy ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of our lord it is receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word the works would follow if you get the word the works are going to follow so we don't we don't major so much on well because you know the pentecostal the pentecostal ideas let's force something to happen but you get the word and you don't have to force nothing to happen all you got to do is relax and let it automatically happen like a lamb that eats eats grass and boom out it all of a sudden out out comes wool or a little dove that's just eating and eating what is going to eat and and it just naturally produces that oil out of its feathers out of its skin and doesn't have to force nothing to happen at all it just automatically happens so why would they not go on why would you just not go on and why would why would david and corey and all those not go on why would that walk with with moses and saw the actual pillar of fire and the manifestation of the signs and wonders and and all the things that moses demonstrated why would they god not go on now in luke chapter 13 and i got my little diagram of body spirit and soul of a person that's anointed and and in church but an anointed with the baptism of the holy ghost on their spirit but in luke chapter 13 it says jesus said then said one unto him that they were asking jesus lord are there few that be saved and he said unto them strive to enter in at the straight gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able there's many that come to church but the swinging incense in front of you doesn't save you confessing things to a priest doesn't save you as many come to church and they want to get in but what gets you in is receiving the word for your day when once the master of the house has risen up and has shut to the door and you begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord lord open unto us and he shall answer it and say unto you i know not i know you not whence you are i i don't know where you come from i don't i don't recognize you then shall you begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy presence we we went to church we were there we we felt the baptism in the holy ghost maybe maybe somebody will say that i said and i said in brother branham's camp meetings and and i was there and i saw things moving and i saw the presence of the lord doing things and thou has taught in our streets but he shall say i tell you i know you not when you are depart from me all you workers of iniquity all you workers of iniquity so the problem is iniquity iniquity now iniquity is one of those words that uh we we don't use you know you don't if if you see something wrong in the grocery store when you're standing in the checkout line you're looking at the magazines you don't say look at that iniquity that's not a word that we use commonly that's but but if you really if you want to understand what the bible's talking about and how he was bruised for our iniquities and and he he paid the price for our iniquity you've got to understand if you don't understand what iniquity is then you won't get the sense the essence of what the bible is about because you got to to know that you're born and sin shaping in iniquity that you come that way and you need something to pay the price for that iniquity if you don't know what iniquity is then you don't realize what what situation you're in brother brown will say iniquity i got this picture of a crossroads you got a crossroads and you got evil and good you you got and every one of us are at the crossroads where we we've got a choice laid before us just like just like adam and eve which way you're gonna go the choice was laying before adam and eve don't don't eat from the tree of got knowledge of good and evil don't don't do what god says don't do and they had that choice now when he got to listening to the to the beast that the devil speaking through the beast she began to look at maybe look at things in a different way and think maybe she had a little bit more understanding than her husband did and and and she had that choice presented to her and iniquity got to working what is iniquity to know to know what to do and to go the other way now now think about what a strange thing it is to know what to do if you know what to do and you know what's right and you won't do it that seems like the confession of a madman if you know what to do and you won't do it but yet we were born that way we come into the world because we're a product of that decision that adam and eve made adam knowingly eve deceived into it and and from that from that uh that decision that they made everyone came forth from that shaping that way shaping in iniquity to know what to do and to not do it you think of all the all the decisions all the things that are placed in front of us that you know uh even this morning when you got up you had a decision whether to come to church or not or to you know to to just sit home with your with maybe with your nose running or whatever and say i'm not going to do it you had you had a decision you have a decision whether to pay your tithes or not and see my i use a lot of people get antsy when the preacher starts talking about paying tithes because they think well you're you're pulling for money or or whatnot but you know paying tithes is uh there's a blessing in malachi 3 that if you pay tithes he will rebuke the devourer he'll rebuke the devourer so that means when somebody when the economy starts crashing or something or you get laid off then you can lay that before god and say well i did everything you're saying and you can you can you can you have something that you can you can say lord i've done everything that you require now i i come on the scene and fight for me because you promised that you would rebuke the devourer but if you're not paying your tithes then see there's iniquity because you know what to do and you won't do it something that you actually know is right and you won't do it now so so brother ram said workers of iniquity something that you know that you ought to do and will not do it and the international standard bible encyclopedia says not an action but the character of an action so before before you sin before sin comes into the picture there's iniquity so let's picture you at that crossroads and you before you take the first step you got your foot up in the air you're you're thinking i'm not i'm not going to church or or let's do you know you need to be born again and you think i i don't need to be born again and before you take that step there's iniquity because iniquity is what drives the action a new what is iniquity iniquity is it comes from that the the hebrew evol which means crooked or bent like a like an old man that's bent over or a road that's twisted and so iniquity is when you take the truth the correct the correct meaning of the thing the correct actioning and you twist it up so that it means something different now isn't that what he didn't have what the uh the the devil told eve in the garden he took the truth and twisted it up by just adding a little bit extra to it you'll not surely die you'll not surely die and twisted it up and and then iniquity entered the picture and it got it twisted up all the action it twisted up all every everything from that point forward crookedness perverseness evil regarded as that which is not str straight or upright moral distinction to bend make crooked or perverted now see that's what paul's talking about these workers of iniquity that that the the reason they didn't go forward was because there was iniquity in them you think about jesus sitting there talking with nicodemus at night telling him explain to him you need to be born again why would nicodemus not keep going on last next time we find is nicodemus nicodemus there at the cross helping take jesus down off the cross but he didn't wind up at pentecost why would he not keep going on brother brown said what is iniquity it's something that you know that's right and you concede it and won't do it in your heart when you know that that bible teaches a certain thing and you won't do it that's iniquity and david said if i hide iniquity in my heart god will not even hear my prayer why would god hear a prayer of a man that knows he's supposed to do something and down in his heart he's like yeah i should have done that but he won't confess it and make it right but if you repent with a pure and a contract heart lay it out there before god just lay it out there and admit your wrongs that's the heart that god will forgive but if you're holding in there i will i know that i'm doing something wrong but but i'm not going to make it right god won't hear hear that brother brown will say iniquity is something that you going out and you do it and you know you ought to have done it now now look let's keep it in the context of what we're reading hebrews chapter six taste of the good word of god and the powers of the world to come and if they shall fall away to renew them again under repentance this is really the problem the root of the problem what is iniquity iniquity is something that you know that you're doing that you ought not to do and still won't repent of it if i regard iniquity in my heart knowing that i should do it and don't do it then god promised the bible promises that god will not hear your prayer if you know you should do it and won't do it what is iniquity and i just got all these quotes kind of strung together here inequity is something that you know you ought not to do and you do it anyhow iniquity is something that you know that you ought to do and you won't do it you know better but won't do it it's iniquity see you know they should stay with the word of god but for the church's sake or somebody else's sake or something else you'll stray from the word of god and do what the organization says so there we got the sense of what iniquity is when you won't do what the word says because of your pride well i can't do that because i might i don't want to get born again because i don't want my parents to get credit for anything that i've done with my salvation i don't want somebody to see me jump and shout i don't want to preach the truth because my organization stands for it differently or or anything anything that you put in front of the word of god so let's go to this next lie y'all like this these are not quotes for brother randall these are quotes from brother dale this is what brother dale said iniquity is the conceiving part of it the baby is the product the baby is what's brought forth and we've already seen we were products of iniquity the new birth took care of the iniquity for our soul made a way for the body to be redeemed but the body is not yet redeemed is not redeemed yet it's still a product of iniquity and unless you're born again unless you are a christian you are totally a product of iniquity your soul is doomed for a devil's hell so look now you come born in sin shape and iniquity you come the wrong way and you need something to make your soul right you need something to make your spirit right you need something to make your body right but god starts with your soul and every man knows that he's got to be born again by the spirit of god this is what brother brown said you've got to receive the holy ghost so to go away from that and to turn back from it like dathan or cora or judas did is iniquity because you know you need to be born again that's everything just runs up into that the umbrella of all those things is that you've got to be born again because being born again is what takes care of the iniquity problem in your soul you're not even positioned to believe right if you don't have if you're not born again but when god enters into your soul then you start thinking right you start thinking looking at the scripture differently because now that iniquity problems taken care of in your soul look at what the bible says about iniquity in job chapter 34 there is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves in psalm chapter 14 have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat of my people as they eat bread and call not upon the lord in psalm 37 a psalm of david frett not thyself because of evil doers neither neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity somebody that knows what the right path is to take but they won't do it the way of the lord is strength to the upright but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity draw me not away with the wicked and with the workers of iniquity which speak peace to their neighbors but mischief is in their hearts because they know the right way to go but they won't do it in luke 13 he said but he shall not say i tell you i know you not whence you are depart from me all you workers of iniquity and in second thessalonians remember you not that when i was yet with you i told you these things and now you know that with what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity does already work now what's the mystery of iniquity deception you know it's it's the devil working and starting off in a little baby form where eventually he winds up well there's there's iniquity and maturity but the iniquity iniquity is deception iniquity is is a lie something to deceive you with to make you do what you know the opposite of what you know to do now now look let's just tie in daniel 9 70 weeks are coming upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish their transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and see the jews need something something an antidote for their iniquity and there's another quote for brother dale when they see him incarnate that proves that their iniquity is gone and leadership brother ram said many of you think i got the baptism the holy ghost i'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell how can that be if you've still got iniquity in your heart and you won't receive the word for your day you won't do what god says for you to do if you've got iniquity and you know that you need to be baptized but you won't do it or you know that you need to be born again it doesn't matter if you're baptist baptized with the holy ghost in your spirit on your flesh it doesn't matter because down on the inside of your soul the thing that drives your being the thing that that that that drives the course of your life there's something wrong you look at this diagram of a believer on the left there's a i got a little a little serpent down in the bottom of that uh and on the inside of the soul with in the body and spirit you could be anointed but there's there's something wrong on the inside but but when you receive the word for your age and it's quicken it lights up that that soul drives out the iniquity changes that heart so you're positioned to believe and you begin reading the bible differently but you you know god the the the what god and i'm i'm going to wrap up here in just a minute but god wants to take over all of your soul and your spirit and your body and that message the door to the heart he said you want him as a savior but what about him being your lord that'll control you control your emotions control your thinking control your every fiber of you that you could say like the man years ago who led him in for me to live as christ and to die is gain so brother adam would say and the anointing ones at the end time he said what is iniquity it's something that you know you ought to do and you won't do it they know that word they hear it you're listening to this tape you're listening to this message that's a strong statement right there somebody be listening to the same message but yes have something something askew in their heart you see the lord god said so you see him confirm it make it true and you know this just as plain as the sun is shining outside but you that'll hold on to your denomination the musicians can go ahead and come forward hold on to those false things you worker of iniquity oh yeah i did i had great campaigns i'd done this i'd done that said you depart from me you worker of iniquity i never knew you well the holy ghost fell on me i don't doubt that a bit i spoke in tongues i sing in the spirit i don't doubt that'll be it no question of that old brother sister what kind of a condition this is a trembling time where we at this word is coming to life now god bless you thanks [Applause] you
