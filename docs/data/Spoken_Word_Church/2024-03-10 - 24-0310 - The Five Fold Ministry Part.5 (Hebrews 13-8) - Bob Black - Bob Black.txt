========================================

God bless you Saints and good morning and and my dad is doing a whole lot better thank you for your prayers he's U it's one of those strange things he'll forget be forgetful and can't remember things for few hours and then um they he spent a night in the hospital and he's doing much better now but just keep him in prayer let's see where were before we got interrupted by necessity Hebrews 13:8 Lord Jesus we're so grateful to be able to come together around your word and we just ask Lord that you'll just bless us this morning as we study these things out and guide us Lord through your scriptures I pray God that you'll just be with brother weight as he's prepared and studying Lord Lord guide our hearts and our minds Lord to be in the right attitude today Lord Jesus to hear what you have in store for us in your name bless us we pray amen so um we're getting close to Hebrews and uh we'll just pray pray that the Lord will guide me into what we're going to study next I've got a few things on on my mind um but Hebrews 13:7 says remember then which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and brother would say in scriptural signs of the time remember our God is still the god of Elijah he is still the God that he ever was he's still the same God he moves in the same cycle he does the same thing he is the same God same yesterday today and forever I've seen them stand dumbfounded paralyzed and taken off the field God Still Remains God now wasn't that Elisha's testimony when he come after Elisha Elijah went up in the fiery Chariot he he he come back to that the the the River Jordan and said I I know that he's still the same yesterday today and forever and he took that that mantle and and struck the river and said where is the god of Elijah because he had confidence that God is still the same yesterday today and forever and he's still the same today and lead not unto thine own understanding brother R said if I had listened to reasons there would probably have been thousands of people died years ago but I carried a message exactly like he said around and around the world and I'm going again by the grace of God not by reasons but by commission Hallelujah I lean not you say you're 55 years old if I was 95 that don't mean a thing he is still the same God that he was with Abraham yes sir and what a confidence we can have this morning that he is still the same that he always was and in Hebrews 139 Paul says be not carried about with diverse and strange doctrines now all these different kind of things that you could believe about different voices for it is a good thing that the heart be established Lish with Grace not with meat Meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle now look what he's saying let's not be established with Meats now you know the Old Testament they had all these requirements of different kinds of food that you could eat you could eat clean food you could eat vegetables with fruits and nuts and honey and milk and butter and eggs and cheese imagine even to this day the the the Hebrews the Jews are so careful not to mix this kind when they're preparing their food they don't mix this kind of food with this kind of food the the everything's got to be prepared in just a certain way better not eat any rabbits hairs and rodents no web footed birds and their eggs and so they were very focused on all this on all the structure of the law the dos and the don'ts and and they they've got they had they've got their rule book now maybe this morning there's many of us that might have have a a rule book that we're trying to follow trying to live our life by a rule book but that's not the new test that's not the New Testament the New Covenant is not living your life by a rule book now look what if if we read from the from the new international Readers version of what Paul's trying to say he said don't be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings it's good that God's grace makes our heart strong don't depend on Foods the law requires they have no value for the people who eat them so in other words if we could kind of distin that down into what he's trying to say salvation is not based on a list of rules that we have to follow you're not you're not bringing uh you know the Christian Life will produce fruits it will produce fruits but you don't start off your journey by bringing your fruits that's where Kane messed up in it he thought well I I want to I want to be a good person I want to I want to I want to you know I'm trying to trying to do trying to manufacture a good life so to speak we'll put it like that and he brought his fruits first and tried to make that the offering but that's not how we come you come you come like Abel did identifying yourself with your sacrifice crying and balling and dying out to yourself and and that's how you start your journey and then the fruits will manifest from that amen look what Paul's saying it's a good thing that the heart be established with Grace not with meech which which have not profited them that have been occupied therein spiritual power and growth come from God's grace rather than adherence to rituals or laws transformation and power comes from within through God's grace rather than external observances what's Paul hitting at that legalistic mindset that when you come to the house of God or in your Christian Journey you've got a l a bunch of rules you got to keep rule rules won't get you anywhere well let's look at some of the traits of legalism if you got that legalistic mindset it makes you self-righteous or you're trying to find somebody you you've got your list of rules and you start pointing with that finger well you're not keeping the rules that I think you should be keeping at when you start judging the other person it gives you that judgmental attitude you're quick to criticize or condemn others often without understanding or empathy see what legalism does it takes away your empathy you don't really care about the other person all you're caring about is that rule keeping you're caring about the you're caring about the rules could you imagine if if uh when David was hungry and he ran and and he he went to he found the Tabernacle and he ate of the showbread in the in the Tabernacle which was only lawful for the priest to eat if you're if you're looking at it from a legalistic standpoint you'll say well I know you're hungry and you're about famished but my rule book says that you can't have any food you see how the devil will twist something something that could be good and twist it because you're you're looking at it from the wrong you're from the wrong perspective that legalism makes you you won't have any compassion like like somebody that's just legalistic no David sorry you can't have any you can't have any food the Jews there as as Jesus was going through the corn fields with his disciples and they on the sabath here you are on the Sabbath trying to get a little sustenance but our rule book says no you you got to you just got to be hungry no compassion and you become resistant to growth unwilling to change due to fear comfort and familiarity or closed mindedness and legalism makes you motivated by fear following rules more out of fear of punishment or judgment than out of love or understanding now that's what a legalistic mindset will do you're you're you're just com I got to do this or I'm going to get in trouble I got to I got to follow this rule or I'm going to lose my salvation if I don't follow this Rule and you've got your little rule book say you got to you got to adhere to now that's what Paul is adhering at in Romans 14: 13-1 17 he said let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather that no man put us stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth anything to be unclean to him it is unclean But If thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walst thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died let not then your good be evil spoken of for the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost right what's what's he talking about you you can't make somebody be a Christian by putting them in a headlock and making them not eat or or you know it's got to be something that God's word produces in their life something natural because you can't come like Cain with your fruits first you got to come like Abel with your sacrifice first and then it will work out the way that it's supposed to that's right there's the pattern in Matthew chapter 23 Jesus said woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and Anis and cumin and and have admitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and Faith these ought you to have done and not to leave the other undone you blind guides would strain at a KN and swallow a camel they had they had forgotten they've beg gotten so wrapped up in their legalistic mindset that they forgot about just being good people they forgot about they forgot about judgment being be looking looking at things from a a a a right attitude they forgot about showing Mercy they forgot about showing Faith but they were so wound up in doing the taking taking care of tithing their little the little herbs and their little spices but he was saying you should do both of those things you should take care of the T tithe what you're supposed to tithe but also don't forget to just be be good and righteous righteous and loving to one another do all the things that that really the law was actually speaking of and that's why in second Corinthians Paul tells us that the letter kth but the spirit giveth life and you can see there that the letter if you don't have the spirit to Quicken it and and really give the true interpretation you could be you could be like uh uh maybe a legalistic priest when David comes running up want some food and You' be ready to kill him because I'm sorry you just can't have any food or maybe like the Pharisee that says well uh I'm sorry you can't have any corn for my field because it's the Sabbath day and you're just going to have to starve I'm sorry and that's how the letter kills because it that you don't have the right inter ration of it the right interpretation will make somebody willing to sacrifice themselves willing to lay down their life for their brother willing to give up things so that somebody else can have it willing to willing to do good and love and and love one another that's that's what real Christianity is about now now here we've got the story in Matthew 121:4 that says where you got to got a picture of real legalism Jesus and his disciples going through that cornfield at that time time Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the corn and his disciples were in hunger and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat but when the Pharisees saw it they said unto him Behold thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day but he said unto them have ye not read what David did when he was in hunger and they that were with him how he entered into the house of God and did eat the Sho bread which was not lawful for him to eat Nei neither for them which were with him but only for the priest only for the priest and that legalistic mindset there they they they could not fathom that Jesus could go isn't that interesting how the Pharisees had such a legalistic mindset such a twisted view that they could see Jesus healing somebody in the next to the pool of Bethesda on the Sabbath day and they think there's something wrong with that that their Viewpoint was looking at something good the son of man coming and doing something good and they looked at it from an evil perspective right I I think sometimes how you know even in church you can you can sit everybody's listening through a different filter you know one I I I got to minister at this one Church where there's a brother that everybody knew in the church he had left the message and he didn't he he was sitting in the church disbelieving and I'm sitting there preaching away at him and everybody's got they're listening through their different filter Believers and here's a everybody knows he's an unbeliever it's not a secret and he's sitting there but he's amening but he's amening through his filter I I'll say something like you got to have a real revelation of God for yourself and he'll my my wife's sitting in front of him so she could hear him behind him amen but she knows that he's amening from a position of disbelief because he's not really believing what I'm saying he's believing from his perspective now see how you can the Pharisees there they're they're they're listening they're they're they're looking at the word from their filter from their a different kind of understanding and it twists it it twists the meaning of it so you can come I you know i' I was talking to a minister up in Ohio one time and he really he said something that really stuck with me I I want to be known for what I'm for not for what I'm against because see the Pharisees the Pharisees they they got it in their mind that they're just against something and you can come into church and you're just against everything and you're you're not you you lose sight of what you're really for I want to be for something I I was reading last night about that story brother R I'm telling the little story of the of the little boy on the bicycle and and uh all the other kids were making fun of him and and uh and you know they could ride their bikes with with no handlebars but he got on up on that plank and he began to look at the destination where he's going and he began to pedal and he got to the end of it and they began to how did you do it and he said well I I wasn't looking at what my situation how it was maybe less than ideal maybe my situation was maybe not exactly the way that I would want it but yet I'm looking at the destination where I'm going and our destination where where we're going is we're going to a Rapture we're going to a body change and we we don't look at the obstacles and everything because we're for something we're not against everything right look look at this mindset this is the that legalistic phical mindset where you just start looking looking at everything from a negative perspective and and everything's everything's got to be a challenge you everything your whole journey is you got to be against somebody or against something do you want to be against this do you want to be against that I'm against this other church I'm against this Doctrine against everything but but if you can get break out of that and be for something be for Christ be for living a real Godly life being a be for for being a real Christian then we'll get somewhere and what is being a real Christian in Romans chapter 12 it says do not be Paul said do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good now see see the difference between Cain and Abel and the Pharisees and Jesus they the Pharisees thought they were being good but they were actually horrible evil and a and real Christianity is good it's willing to lay down your life for somebody else it's willing to do something when everybody else wrong you you're willing to reward evil with good in every circumstance to not say something about somebody not do something harmful and Ephesians 4:29 let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths but only such as is good for building up as fits the occasion that it may give Grace to those who hear Galatians 5:22 says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness self-control against such things there is no law but you don't bring your fruits as your sacrifice the fruits is the end of the story that's where Cain got messed up in 1 Thessalonians 5: 15 see that no one repays anyone evil for evil but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone and James 3:17 it says but the wisdom from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle open to reason full of mercy and good fruits impartial and sincere in 1 Peter 3:11 let him turn away from Evil and do good let him seek peace and pursue it it's peace peace and Reconciliation and love and goodness are all the things that the gospel is proclaiming that's why God keeps his word brother said God has a program and that program is written in his word and his word said we should be one all together not a divided divisions and fusses and stews but we should be one Christ prayed that we would be one and he said this will all men know you are my disciples when you have love one for the other now here's the thing that really I is a sticking point how how can gifts and signs work in a church how can God perfect his church when there is so much Division division Among Us how can when one says this and one says that and one says something else and all contrary one to the other there is one supreme judge that's God's Eternal Everlasting word and God keeps his word so quicker we can line up with that word the better off we'll be God keeps his word what is this trying to express that you can get all wrapped up in everything that you're against or you can be for something now that's what happened on the day of Pentecost they forgot what they were against and they begin to set their eyes on what they were for they wanted to see the spirit and the power of God fall and they begin to look in with one Accord with one goal toward toward that goal and that's how you see the spirit of God fall in a congregation you can almost say this might sound negative you will never see people speaking tongues you will never see see a move of the spirit when you've got a divided congregation you will never see people run up and down the aisle you will never see people lift up their hands in Liberty and worship God when you've got people that are divided but when you people have have a group of people that are in one Accord looking toward a common goal looking to Christ like that little boy on the bicycle then you'll see Liberty then you'll see God begin to move on the scene but you'll never have that in a divided congregation you can almost say that that's thus sayith the Lord you will never have God move in a congregation that's divided you must set your sight on Christ and look to him look to him with one Accord and look for for something not with for not against something that's how he said all men will know you're my disciples when you love one for the other the world's so thirsty for that friend and God is love until we can get Brotherly Love we'll never get very far with God we need a Revival of Love amongst the children of God love is what we need that's why in 1 Corinthians 13:2 Paul said and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries like like like the Pharisees like the Jews they understood all the things that by the letter in the Bible they understood all those things but what good does it do if you don't have the true correct interpretation where you can love somebody that hates you where you can lay down your life for somebody that that that says something wrong about you right all and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing we are nothing without love love will make you give up something for somebody else in Hebrews 13:10 he says we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle now let's examine that and see what it says see what it means we have an altar where of they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle the altar is where the sacrifice is made so what that means is those who continue to adhere to that legalistic way of thinking symbolized by serving the Tabernacle with their rules with their list of rules that they've got to adhere to do not have access to the spiritual benefits you don't have any right to eat of the New Covenant if you're still serving that that that Old Testament rule book that where you've got a list of things that that you you're trying to adhere to you have no right to eat of that new covenant the promises of the New Covenant and Hebrew and Paul goes on in verse 11 for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come now in the Old Testament when they sacrificed an animal they would take it like in Leviticus 41:12 when they would make a sin offering for the priest or sin offering for the congregation they would take the blood and they would offer it on the Altar and then they would take the animal skin and all the pertinence and they would take it outside of the camp to a clean place and they would burn the ashes and burn it on the burn them on the wood with fire where the ashes are poured out and then again when you you you had the scapegoat that would uh go free Into the Wilderness and and the the other goat was offered as a as a sin offering they would take that uh the skin of that animal and they would carry it forth without the camp and that's a type of Jesus when he was offered up you can see here this map of Jerusalem that outside of the gate they took him and they offered him up there at gtha which was outside outside of the walls and brother AB would say I know there is some reason that people are not getting through to Christ if they would they wouldn't act like that Jesus suffered without the gates that he might sanctify his people with his own blood sanctification comes from a Greek word compound which means cleaned and set aside for service and when God cleans his people with the blood of Jesus he cleans them from the filth of the world and sets them aside for service and going beyond the camp said it seems today to be a day of when people are going beyond the camp and everything they're going Beyond you know I was told some time ago that they had a jet plane now that can make them noises we hear around here that shakes the windows it's when the plane has got so fast that it crosses its own sound called sound barrier and when it goes beyond its own sound barrier it's almost unlimited to what it'll do and I think in there that we get a lesson when we go beyond our own sound barrier into the word of God then it's unlimited what God can do with a man that's ready to go beyond the camp the camp of man that is now we see that going beyond the camp going Beyond this and then again he said 3,000 years ago a man can meet God most anywhere it was a common thing for a man to meet God but why don't they meet him today in the case of Abraham and in his Camp why it was almost an everyday occasion that Abraham met God he talked to him not only that but when they went down into guar to sojourn we find out down there that guar was in the camp with ailec a Philistine it was a very common thing they lived in the camp of his presence what's he talking about if you go go beyond everybody's got camps you got a little Camp of your own ideas you camp your Camp of man but if you can get past that camp of your own ideas and your own thoughts and get into the camp of God then you can have Fellowship continually go with God get past all break past that sound barrier and and and and begin to fellowship with God and and again he said so notice he rebuked them and they put him out of their Camp Jesus suffered without the camp they put him out of the camp outside Way Beyond their camp we find out that the Bible said in this last day under this leay out ofy and age they would do the same thing they would be put out of the camp now watch what he says to do now in closing put out of the camp where the sacrifices was burned that's where he Bel he was the sacrifice he said now brother sister do you know that each one of you all must sacrifice you must be God's sacrifice sacrifice the things of the world sacrifice your own pleasures of this world sacrifice the things of the world you know the reason that people won't do it he said we're not asked to manufacture something that's Cain bringing his fruits we're asked to Bear the fruit of the spirit that is the ins side of the sheep what he is on the inside makes the wool on the outside and when a man has got Christ on the inside it makes him Christlike on the outside not some artificial put on that artificial put on is that legalistic Pharisee is trying to fake it trying to trying to put the the real feathers in his you know trying to trying to act like something that he's not but a real a real genuine a real genuine Holy Ghost experience will make the letter it it will take the letter and produce produce something real and we'll stop right there God bless you Saints [Applause] amen
