[Music] god bless you saints we got a little small crowd this morning good to be here we're two and three together together we sure been getting a blessing out of listening to the to the camp and uh i'm so proud of all the the kids getting up and singing we were watching the specials and everything it's uh it's it's good you know when they get to camp they can kind of they make their own decision i guess you know that's good that when when they don't have mom and daddy there to prod them they're doing they're doing it they're they want to do something for the lord and that's good that's good to see how many enjoy brother ryan's sunday school lesson last sunday appreciate it appreciate that if you didn't listen to that i encourage you to go back and listen i sure enjoy that story about the uh don't forget the main thing um and the other things he shared let's go into we're just i think we're about done with hebrews chapter one um we're just taking our time with if the brothers can pull that up and uh and we're um just kind of going going through at a at maybe a slow pace but just so some things settle in so verse seven is where we uh or well actually we we ended up at verse 13 but let's just kind of read a background we'll just briefly background some things this morning to kind of set some context again before we keep going and verse 7 says and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and as ministers of flame of fire but under the sun he saith thy throne o god is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom thou has loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god even thy god hath anointed thee with all of gladness above thy fellows and thou lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands they shall perish but thou remain us and they all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a vester shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy year shall not fail but to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make thine enemies that footstool so last time we kind of dwelled on this a little bit if you go to the next slide and we begin to kind of meditate on how god has set himself down somewhere and we began to ask the question where did we see it and uh you know i'm kind of trying to follow a thread of the thought through this and putting because you know you can you can be in it begin to think um you know that uh a lot of times our mind will begin to go that god is somewhere far off on on like the other side of the galaxy or somewhere far off unreachable but the bible says he's not he the word is nighty even in thy mouth he'll be with you he's with you and he'll never leave you forsake you and those kind of things so so the thought is that he's actually he sat down in your heart and if you go to the next the next uh slide that he's in the old testament the type was that there was a mercy there was a seat for him to sit and he sat down between the cherubims and in type showing that one day he would set down in your heart in the middle of your three-room house and the bible says in psalm 99 1 the lord reigneth let the people tremble he sitteth between the cherubims let the earth be moved it's really important to kind of set this framework down so that when you begin to all the scripture ties together so beautifully and you begin to get over in revelation and it talks about one sitting on the throne and those kind of things and it's helpful to be able to you got to have the picture set so that you can so that you don't have the cloud uh the clouds on the ground and the cow up in the sky and everything and it creates a great big beautiful beautiful picture so when you get over in revelations you can read it the right way of what it's really saying so when and when brother brown went on the next slide when he preached revelation chapter 4 he said now the mercy seat now the mercy seats in the heart seek where the shining forth of his glory and all of his children the shekinah glory and the human heart is that the mercy seat and then in in yale a highlight he said is god's presence and when a man walking or a woman he's reflecting the shekinah glory he don't go into gambling dens and carry on and go out here and deny the word no matter what the people says he's got his heart set on one thing god because god is set down on the mercy seat in his heart and in the next slide and that's why peter on the day of pentecost began to quote that the lord said thou almight he began to quote that scripture from psalms for david is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand until i make thy foes thy footstool and then the next slide we talked about how that the enemy the last enemy to be to be defeated is death or in first corinthians chapter 15 says then cometh in when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall put down all reign and all authority and power for he must reign until he hath put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed as death so now you got a picture of of christ he's now he died on the cross for us but he couldn't yet take his he couldn't yet to go and sit on his throne so he comes down and sits on the father's throne which is in your heart and he's doing the work of the high priest in the old testament the high priest would go beyond the veil and he'd put the blood on the altar and he would he would go in and do the work and then he would come out he'd come out and and everybody would you know everybody maybe would be breathlessly waiting for him to come out wondering if he was going to die i wonder if everything worked out all right and they'd have that tassel tied to him so that if he did die while he was doing the work he would they could drag him out that rope the rope tied to him and so he's doing the work of the high priest and all that speaking of something that christ is doing if you go to the next slide christ has been doing for the last 2000 years now see this is why uh daniel's 70 weeks is so important so i just want to i'm just going to touch on this really quick because daniel 70 weeks lays out the pattern a lot of times when you read scripture it's so important to see the pattern everything god does he's the same yesterday today and forever and he works in patterns if you can see the pattern that he works in then everything begins to start fitting together and the pattern here is that christ died on the cross he preached for three and a half years and then he sits he sits on your throne for two thousand years and then when he's done with the atonement the atonement process when he's done when he's finished he rises and is made he visibly comes and takes his throne again he's visible again so there's a pattern now now he uh god actually even repeated that pattern and the six-fold purpose a lot of people wonder you know i've talked to people what am i supposed to really be getting out of daniel 70 weeks we'll get that pattern and then then the pattern is repeated the pat the whole pattern that you can see as the seals are open and all the the the process of redemption that christ has brought us through then it repeats in the sixth full purpose six seals finishes redemption there's a six-fold purpose to to that god brings uh israel in the and and and works through that seven years to until he can finally come and take his throne again you know there's even a pattern in genesis where for six days got first he he spoke and there was light and then he's began to separate the atmosphere and then life began to come up from the ground and then he began to turn just like the seals he began to turn his attention to the to the heavens turn his attention to the sun and the moon you you can apparently see there's patterns things and then on the seventh day finally you got a masterpiece family again back in harmony walking in the garden and then when christ comes when he returns to sit on his throne you've got him coming back with his bride coming back in the millennium to rule and reign coming back in harmony so see i got down here at the bottom sit until see it he's sitting until the last enemy is defeated so let's go to the next slide and the fourth seal brother brown said and then we find out that in the revealing of the seals that the lamb had left his mediatorial work as an intercessor because he's he's done he's done the media tour he's he's he's done the work of the high priest and had come forth now to claim his rights all that he had redeemed by his death and then no one could open the book no one understood it it was a book of redemption and god the father spirit had it in his hand because christ was at the throne as a mediator the only mediator where's the throne at now we just laid that out the throne is at the throne of your heart doing the work that when you the work of a mediator when you might do something wrong then his blood is covering you he's on the throne of your heart that when you when you just do something wrong because he's on the throne you you want to repent you you go and you ask god forgive me because and he's there he's there to to do the work of a mediator you see that's one of the main topics of hebrews is that christ is our high priest he's he's our high priest and that's what paul as we go through hebrews he's bringing that out he's he's fulfilling what was typed in the old testament the work of a high priest he's he's the he's the high priest and he's sitting on the throne of our heart doing that part doing that work therefore there could be no saint no mary no joseph no nothing else on that altar because it was blood and only the blood of jesus could make the atonement and in the first seal brother brahm said and notice every time joseph left when joseph rose up from that right hand of that throne watch glory there set joseph by the right hand of pharaoh and when joseph raised up to leave that throne the trumpet sounded bow the knee everybody joseph is coming when that lamb leaves the throne yonder on his days of mediatorial work when he leaves the throne up there and takes that book of redemption and walks forth every knee will bow and every tongue confess there he is there he is visible now now see when you look at that chart of daniel 70 weeks and you see that pattern uh one thing i kind of want to bring out you can you look at that pattern of what how god is how the redemption plan and and you look and you study it and you see the pattern begin to unfold but then then slowly something begins to reveal to you god begins to speak to you of a work that god is doing in you so that's the really the main thing it's got to be personal we can look at we can look at the chart of daniel 70 weeks and weeks it's like it's like a history lesson you know things things happen in the first three ages and then the next age and then the next two ages and the next age and so on and so forth the souls under the altar and it looks like something that you just study out but what you got to be getting out of it is something that god's doing in you that's why when you when you it's so important to understand where the throne is because it's not just something to learn about something that we we just kind of have the mechanics about but to know that god is actually abiding in your heart that he's come down to sit in you that see then it becomes personal then it becomes god's doing something something real in your life and then and the soul's in prison now uh in on the next slide brother brown said uh that's a fantastic sermon if you want to dive into the seals too brother brown says things that in that sermon i don't know if he says anywhere else he said but under the sixth seal were these trumpets opened remember under there we find out that the lamb came forth appeared on the scene he appeared on the scene he had left the mercy seat his work of redemption was finished and he came forth and took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on the throne and time was no more and that next quote the revelation of jesus christ he said do you see it the lamb the high priest the high priest holding his blood as an atonement on the mercy seat for our sins is the lord god almighty that is his present office that is what he is doing now pleading his blood for our sins but one day that lamb will become the lion of the tribe of judah he will come forth in power and glory and take his authority to reign as king and when he's king he'll become visible again visible manifested in the flesh so that he can come and actually sit down on the throne a physical throne manifested physically so the next slide just to kind of sum up that again where where did he sit he sat on the throne he's sitting now on the throne of your heart and that's why paul in hebrews 1 13 but to which of the angels he didn't say that to any angels he didn't say that any old testament prophets sit on my right hand until i make thine enemies that footstool to sit on the right hand of god and power and authority to sit down not on a thrown way out somewhere but on the throne of your heart not to just play games but in power and authority to actually overcome overcome all your stubbornness like brother brown was saying in that sermon that that was playing before to overcome all your stubbornness and pride and and overcome your desire for sin sitting down in power and authority on your throne until every enemy has ever come the overcoming he's overcoming uh pride and avarice and lust of the flesh and the pride of life until every enemy including death is overcome so let's go to the next slide and we're just going to read this real quick we're just going to touch on this real quick just to kind of lay a thought give you something to think about and meditate on and the first seal brother adam said the voice is a thunder the voice came from where from the throne where the lamb had just left as intercessor to where the voice come from now he's standing here to take his position and his claims but the thunder came from the inside of the throne thundered out and the lamb was standing out here the thunder where the lamb had left left the father's throne to go to take his own throne now he said now don't miss it friends i was listening i was mowing the yard and brother brown was preached i think it was the fourth seal where he spent like 15 minutes talking about y'all y'all ain't gonna see it but i think now we're at a time where we can see these things we all know as christians that god swore to david that he would raise up christ to sit on his throne to sit on his throne and give him an everlasting kingdom here on the earth he did it and jesus said he that overcomes the antichrist and all the things of the world shall sit with me on my throne as i have overcome and have set down on my father strong now someday he rises from the father's throne and goes to take his own throne now he comes forth to call his subjects how's he going to claim them he's already got the book of redemption in his hand now you see how it's got to be personal it's got to be when you when you read it like like that maybe you read it when it becomes personal you're reading it differently because something that is actually happening in your life now let's go to the next slide and we'll finish up we're going to finish up with hebrews chapter one which says which closes out which to which the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make thine enemies that footstool are they not are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of celebration see then he brings it back personal the whole story is about god trying to redeem you he's doing something for you are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation and you are the heirs of salvation so this story this story is about christ and his bride now let's go we got about about 10 more minutes let's start on hebrews chapter 2. and let's just read this and see what good things we can pull out of this chapter as we as we keep moving along hebrews chapter 2 says therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard isn't that the truth after we've heard all those things that paul laid out in hebrews chapter 1 all those good things about where christ sits and that he's greater than all the angels in the old testament and all those things about how he's a high priest and we're going to get into that more lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed to us by them that hurt him god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come wherever we speak but one in a certain place testifies saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visited him thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crowned him with glory and honor and it's this set of set him over the works of our hands thou has put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now now we see not yet all things put under that's a scripture that's packed with lots of interesting things let's go to the next slide but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should take death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and the children which god has given me for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil let's go to the next slide we got a few more verses i'm just kind of reading this to kind of set a little background so we understand what we're getting into and verse 15 says and deliver them who through fear of death we're all their lifetimes subject to bondage my in in that in that good that that's why he came to deliver us from all this fear and all the turmoil and to give us something concrete that we can live for him with for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham wherefore in all things that behooved him to be made unto to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest and things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people there he is being a high priest again for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to sucker them that are tempted that's the kind of high priest we got is not some unfeeling man that that's kind of going through his life he's got his own problems but we've got somebody that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities that that went went through the things that we went through and and and knows and understands whether you're a child or an old man or old lady or whatever it is he knows so let's start let's start going through some of these scriptures and hebrews chapter and i'm going to just kind of read some of the things that brother branham uh said when he was preaching about these things and in hebrews chapter 2 verse 1 therefore we ought to give them more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip now brother adam said what what type of people are now he he really tears to hide off when he's getting into this what type of people ought we to be when we see the great jehovah come down and do the things that he does and see them compared scripture by scripture that they're the truth and we sit around sometimes like wars on a log and just so unconcerned he said we ought to be and i highlighted all these arts we ought to be and we should never be we ought to be busy every minute trying to get people to christ we ought to be lively stones we should never be slothful like we are why because of all that paul laid out in hebrews chapter one all these things that we have access to we ought to be busy for god we'll he said we'll get up to go to church and we'll see the lord jesus do something or bless us in such such a way and then we'll go back out and say very nice meeting wasn't that a good meeting somebody told me one time it was like when they said when i like to hear somebody when they when they say that they enjoy the service actually say something specific about what they enjoy to the service because a lot of times you know we'll kind of let our eyes glaze over and we we go out of this out of the meeting and we we don't really sometimes we just don't really it was just a very nice meeting a very a very nice get-together but church should be what's he saying church should be more than that it should be more than just a get-together why because we've got christ the high priest that was that came to take away all of our problems and and and help us through life and we should be we should be fervent we should be given everything we should we should come expecting we should come expecting to see a miracle in our lives i got i got three minutes we'll do a couple more verses uh let's go to the next slide and brother adam he he went on with with verse one he said then when we see those things take place that we do see take place enough we should never let these things slip we just let it go through our fingers that's what's the matter with the great pentecostal church today they've let the very cream of the crop slip through their fingers when they had it in their hands my goodness not recognizing what you got they didn't recognize what they had but he said but look what they've done they've done like the rest of the churches they run in the game in the way of coral and perished in the way of cane and perished in the gang saying of course and let's let's go on to the next slide what he said he said how did he said the the scripture therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip and he said brother brown said people let it let things slip by by instead of really getting into the scripture we we just start all these arguments and we you know you you're so worried about who's right and who's wrong and everything everybody's all this contention and everything instead of just coming with humility and and bowing ourselves down to the word and just taking it like a little child and accepting what god said uh you know a lot of times well let's let's read what brother brown said he said how did the indians lose this country to the white man is because they were disunified and we'll end on this and the musicians can go ahead and start coming he said if they had one big forefront but they were fighting one among each other they would have held their grounds if they have all come together how are we going to lose it because we're disunified how we how we lose our experience with god is because we disunify we just unify the body of christ we should never be divided we might different ideas but let's be heart and heart brothers god wants us to be he died for the entire church of god and we do not want to be disunified you love him this morning god bless you we go into the song service
