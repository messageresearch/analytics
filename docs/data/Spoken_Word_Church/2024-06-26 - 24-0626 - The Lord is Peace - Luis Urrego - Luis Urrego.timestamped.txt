[4:44] she's on my heart very
[4:46] heavy in this
[4:48] [Music]
[4:52] time Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord

[6:27] Holy you are holy holy
[6:34] holy holy
[6:36] holy
[6:38] holy I want to see
[6:43] you praise the Lord Jesus good afternoon
[6:46] Saints good to be in the house of the
[6:48] Lord this
[6:50] afternoon amen I trust that you all are
[6:53] doing
[6:53] well and uh and so it's definitely hard
[6:59] hard to be up here you know after this
[7:02] week's events so but I know it's harder
[7:06] for the family and so you know I love if
[7:10] I could just say that you know I would I
[7:13] would say probably on behalf of all the
[7:16] other ministers here I don't think we
[7:18] would ever be able to fit the shoes of
[7:21] brother Dell take the place of brother
[7:24] Dell I I just he had he was special in
[7:27] his ministry and what God gave him you
[7:29] you know and uh I can definitely say
[7:33] that I was helped a lot by his ministry
[7:37] I don't think that I would be in the
[7:38] place that I would be in now if it
[7:40] wasn't for the word that he preached and
[7:43] he definitely as I was telling brother
[7:45] Wade he definitely loved this messag he
[7:48] loved the prophet and uh and so I have
[7:53] confidence that what we have heard here
[7:56] in the last 40 or so years or the time
[7:59] that you all I know you all have been
[8:01] here longer most of you
[8:03] all that word will take us to the other
[8:06] side amen because it was the word that
[8:08] brother Brandon preached and brother
[8:10] Brandon preached what Paul preached amen
[8:13] so I I I I definitely I'm I'm confident
[8:16] in that amen and I know that each and
[8:18] every one of us continue to serve the
[8:20] God that he served amen we will see him
[8:23] there on that other side amen and it's
[8:25] not it's not it's not a time uh I I
[8:29] don't think he would probably want to
[8:30] come back in the state that he was in
[8:33] and so we're actually rejoicing amen the
[8:36] have that he's graduated amen amen and I
[8:40] I just I'm I'm ready to see him too am

[8:46] the family in prayer Nanny needs your
[8:48] support needs needs prayer and and and
[8:52] just support her in whatever way you can
[8:54] amen I know that that that would
[8:56] definitely encourage her amen just put
[8:58] yourself in her shoes
[9:00] what would you what would you want
[9:01] people to do for you you see so so with

[14:27] go we were we read we get the word uh
[14:30] Shalom from from uh from Judges chapter
[14:33] 6 and let's just read this here real
[14:35] quick and and it was Gideon that that
[14:38] that said this in in the scriptures and
[14:41] he it says then the angel of the Lord
[14:42] put forth the end of the staff that was
[14:45] in his hand and touched the Flesh and
[14:48] the UNL cakes and There Rose up fire out
[14:50] of the Rock and consumed the Flesh and
[14:52] the UNL cakes and the angel of the Lord
[14:54] departed out out of his sight if you
[14:57] remember uh uh Gideon was in a state of
[15:00] fear at the moment he was in a state of
[15:02] turmoil the people uh his people were in
[15:06] the state of of of fear that they were
[15:09] having to fight uh I believe it was the
[15:11] uh the um H forgot the people that were
[15:14] fighting against at the time uh the
[15:17] Philistines I believe and uh and so they
[15:20] were always constantly in a struggle and
[15:22] they were in and Gideon came to a point
[15:24] where he was in fear but the Lord come
[15:26] to Gideon amen and told him amen you're
[15:29] are a mighty man of Valor even though he
[15:31] was in fear even though he was in
[15:33] turmoil in his mind and tribulation he
[15:36] still spoke to him in a peaceful way and
[15:39] told him positive news gave him positive
[15:42] positive things amen because I I I just
[15:44] want to say that sometimes amen that's
[15:47] that's what we need amen we sometimes we
[15:49] don't need a a rebuke amen what we need
[15:53] sometimes is just peaceful words or just
[15:56] to be heard amen just to be listen
[15:59] listen
[16:00] to you know just to have someone to
[16:03] listen to you that just does wonders to
[16:05] you amen the person may not even say
[16:08] anything to you but that is the therapy
[16:10] within itself just listening to somebody
[16:14] amen causes It's a Wonderful therapy
[16:16] within itself cuz you and I can't fix
[16:19] everybody else's problems you and I
[16:21] can't fix the world's problems amen God
[16:23] is the one that gives the solutions amen
[16:26] but but this is this is what Gideon
[16:28] needed and the angel of the Lord came
[16:30] and and and told him this and and and
[16:32] Gideon gave a a fleece a put of fleece
[16:37] before the Lord and and and and and this
[16:39] was one of the the the fleeces that he
[16:41] put before the Lord then the angel of
[16:43] the Lord put forth the end of the staff
[16:45] that was in his hand and touched the
[16:46] Flesh and the unleavened cakes and There
[16:48] Rose up a fire out of the Rock and
[16:50] consumed the Flesh and the UNL cakes
[16:53] then the angel of the Lord departed out
[16:55] of his sight and when Gideon perceived
[16:58] that he was
[16:59] that he was an angel of the Lord Gideon
[17:02] said alas oh Lord God for because I have
[17:06] seen an angel of the Lord face to face
[17:09] and the Lord said unto him peace be unto
[17:12] thee fear not thou shallal not die amen
[17:17] then Gideon built an altar there unto
[17:19] the Lord and called it Jehovah Shalom
[17:23] unto this day it is yet an Oprah of the
[17:26] aites amen so shalom means Jehovah is
[17:30] peace amen and he is the peace amen when
[17:34] when when we feel like there is no peace
[17:37] he is the the the the the peace that
[17:39] passes all understanding amen and so we
[17:42] we if we can just keep in our mind that
[17:45] nothing happens amen just to happen all
[17:48] has a purpose amen the the the the steps
[17:52] of the righteous man are ordered by the
[17:55] Lord and He Delights in his way amen
[17:59] and so we we we find ourselves in in in
[18:02] in the in in in what we in in what we're
[18:05] in today amen because God deemed it
[18:08] deemed it to be that way amen for
[18:10] whatever reason I he knows we don't know
[18:13] we don't have to know all the details
[18:15] about it amen but as long as he knows
[18:18] amen as long as he is in control amen
[18:20] then we could just rest and have peace
[18:22] and shalone on that amen praise God and
[18:25] and and and sometimes you know we we
[18:27] feel like we we need to explain
[18:28] everything we need you know there's lots
[18:30] of things in the scriptures that we
[18:32] can't explain amen they're there amen
[18:35] even in brother bram's Ministry amen
[18:37] there was things that he couldn't even
[18:38] explain but it happened but as long as
[18:41] God has them in his hands amen as long
[18:43] as God knows all about it amen I want to
[18:46] put my burdens upon him and let him
[18:49] control the the the situations amen
[18:51] praise God and so Saints you know
[18:55] sometimes uh you know Jesus he allows us
[18:58] through to go through painful things
[19:00] amen uh some shame and suffering amen
[19:04] because he knows our expected end if we
[19:07] read in Jeremiah in in Jeremiah CH 29:1
[19:12] he says I like the way the way he says
[19:14] here he says for I know this is God
[19:17] talking through Jeremiah says for I know
[19:21] the thoughts that I think toward
[19:24] you now think about that he knows know
[19:29] every detail every thought that he's
[19:31] thinking of you from the be from from
[19:33] before you were in the mother's womb
[19:35] when you were an attribute of of his he
[19:38] was already he knew exactly what you
[19:39] were going to go through he knew exactly
[19:42] what brother Dale was going to go
[19:43] through amen Seth the Lord so it's the
[19:47] Lord saying it amen thoughts of what
[19:49] thoughts of Peace thoughts of peace and
[19:53] not of evil so we might think oh my this
[19:57] is happening and this it's evil it's
[19:59] tearing me apart but his thoughts of you
[20:03] are not of evil he just said
[20:07] it my thoughts of you are a peace and
[20:10] not a evil what to give you an expected
[20:15] end in other words an end that he he
[20:18] already knew before the foundation of
[20:20] the world and he mo took you in your
[20:23] life amen to come to the point where you
[20:25] are at now amen and it didn't take him
[20:27] by surprise it might take us by surprise
[20:30] but to him amen nothing takes him by
[20:33] surprise amen because he knows the
[20:34] beginning from the End Amen praise God
[20:37] so he knows all the details of our of
[20:39] our of our lives and everything that
[20:41] you're going to go through every every
[20:44] aspect of your life amen the schools
[20:45] that you're going to go to the the jobs
[20:47] that you're going to work every single
[20:50] thing amen he knows and he's guiding the
[20:52] footsteps of the righteous amen praise
[20:54] God you're not here at this moment amen
[20:57] by just because
[20:59] by accident that's right and nothing
[21:02] that has happened Amen in the last few
[21:03] years has happened by accident it was in
[21:07] the plans of God Amen so uh we can rest
[21:11] on that amen the the lives the events in
[21:14] in our lives that they're not surprises
[21:17] amen but they're expected by God because
[21:20] it's what he's seen it's part of
[21:21] predestination amen praise the Lord
[21:24] Jesus amen Colossians 3:3 tells us this
[21:29] it says for ye are dead and your life is
[21:33] hid with Christ in God now notice what
[21:37] it says it's hid amen how many how many
[21:40] played hide and seek
[21:43] before when we played hideing and seek
[21:46] you know and and it was it was you're
[21:48] hiding and and that person is counting
[21:51] and and you're you're away and you're
[21:53] looking for a place to hide and you get
[21:55] down to a certain place and you know
[21:57] they're not going to find you there
[22:00] eventually they're finding everybody
[22:01] else and then eventually either you're
[22:04] going to have to go run to base or
[22:07] they'll find you
[22:08] right but not with God Amen Satan can't
[22:12] even find amen where you are it's it's
[22:16] it's it's a mystery to him how you are
[22:19] HID in Christ Jesus amen that's the
[22:21] reason why your life is coming to an
[22:24] expected End Amen an end that that he
[22:28] had from from the beginning amen from
[22:29] the foundation of the world why because
[22:31] you are HID in him if you are in him
[22:33] amen praise God and your life is hid
[22:36] with Christ in God Amen so nothing that
[22:40] can happen to you nothing that happened
[22:42] Amen to brother Dale amen was unexpected
[22:45] amen God knew all about it before the
[22:48] foundation of the world Amen and it
[22:51] pleased him amen that he had he he went
[22:54] through that Amen in order to get to
[22:55] where he's at now amen
[22:59] praise the Lord Jesus and I and you know
[23:02] sometimes we think death is terrible and
[23:05] I know it is I've seen my in-laws
[23:08] they've passed away I've seen them there
[23:10] with death rattles and my my wife she
[23:13] she took most a lot of the burden with
[23:15] her sisters on that so we know what what
[23:19] the Dell family has gone through in that
[23:22] regard
[23:24] but you know death isn't pretty death
[23:27] isn't pretty but at the same time what a
[23:30] what a gracious thing to have amen a
[23:33] vehicle of
[23:34] death that we can pass from this life
[23:37] amen to graduate to the other side amen
[23:40] what what if we were stuck in in in in
[23:42] in a body amen and just just feeble and
[23:45] getting feeble and getting feeble and
[23:47] older and older and older and there was
[23:49] no way out of that think about that who
[23:52] who would want to live that way amen and
[23:56] so but I'm thankful amen that there is a
[23:58] a that you know from the beginning death
[24:02] it wasn't the intention of God it wasn't
[24:04] his perfect will amen but but it had to
[24:07] happen that way Amen in order because if
[24:10] if if we see death now then that means
[24:12] we can enjoy life amen we we we're we're
[24:16] we're Desiring life amen because we're
[24:18] seeing death all around us you know but
[24:21] brother Brandon preached this message
[24:23] Shalom he talked about the darkness that
[24:25] was squeezing upon the the the the Earth
[24:28] and upon the land that we see all kinds
[24:30] of Darkness taking place in the land uh
[24:34] and and if it's just the darkest age
[24:36] that we've ever lived in total chaos
[24:39] total insanity if brother Brandon
[24:41] thought it was that way back in 1964
[24:45] when he preached this how much Us in the
[24:47] hour that we're living in people just
[24:51] their minds have have been totally is
[24:54] totally insanity and there's nothing
[24:56] that you can say or do to change their
[24:59] mind people are going to go do what they
[25:02] have been anointed to do in order to
[25:04] fulfill the scriptures amen but there's
[25:07] a bride in this hour amen that they're
[25:09] anointed to also fulfill the scriptures
[25:12] amen praise the Lord Jesus they're
[25:15] anointed amen for a resurrection they're
[25:18] anointed for a body change amen they're
[25:21] anointed Amen to to to tell death amen
[25:25] like this and shrug it off and keep
[25:27] moving on Amen there's a people that's
[25:29] going to come to that place amen a and
[25:32] and and it's just as sure as I'm
[25:33] standing here because the why the word
[25:36] declares it and I believe it and that
[25:39] settles it amen so the things that have
[25:42] gone on before us amen we're expecting
[25:44] to see him again because the Bible says
[25:47] so amen we're expecting that we're
[25:50] expecting that brother we're going to
[25:52] see brother Dell again and he won't be
[25:53] the way he left that's right amen we're
[25:55] going to see him Amen in in in Young
[25:59] I never really got to see him how really
[26:01] young amen but I'm going to see him that
[26:05] way when I see him again amen praise the
[26:08] Lord Jesus and some of the other saints
[26:09] that have gone on before us amen they're
[26:12] going to be young praise
[26:13] God so God he has a vision for each and
[26:19] every one of us and he and he knows what
[26:21] it will take to get us to that place
[26:24] amen praise God it's like the Potter
[26:26] amen that's building that out that Clay
[26:28] Pot amen he has a vision before he
[26:31] actually starts working on the pot
[26:34] before he even goes and grabs the water
[26:36] and grabs the clay he already has a
[26:38] vision of the end finin product amen and
[26:42] that's the reason why God Amen he has he
[26:45] knows you from the beginning to the end
[26:47] he has a vision of how you are at the
[26:50] expected End Amen praise God it's
[26:53] something that he expects amen I expect
[26:56] that when I go out there to the car amen
[26:58] this this evening that the car is going
[27:00] to crank amen it's expecting something
[27:03] amen is that you know it's going to
[27:05] happen praise God and so God in his mind
[27:08] he he he just he knows that it's going
[27:11] to happen he knows because it's the
[27:13] expected End Amen praise the Lord Jesus
[27:16] and so that Potter amen he's building
[27:18] this pot he's he's he's working on it
[27:20] amen but as he's working on it amen it's
[27:23] not not looking pretty sometimes
[27:26] sometimes it looks very messy and
[27:28] remember he's he's part of that mess as
[27:30] well the Potter is part of that mess
[27:33] amen he's working and molding on and
[27:35] he's getting dirty himself and I'm so
[27:38] thankful amen that he took the curse
[27:39] before we before us amen he got his
[27:42] hands dirty before we we get our hands
[27:44] dirty amen and he's the one amen who
[27:46] took our place amen and went to hell be
[27:49] for for us amen that we don't have to go
[27:53] hallelujah amen he's the one that did it
[27:56] amen because why he had he did it for an
[27:58] expected end in your life amen praise
[28:01] God and so he's working on this pot amen
[28:04] and then eventually right before right
[28:08] before the pot might be saying if the
[28:09] pot could talk if the vase could talk he
[28:13] would be like wow I've gone through this
[28:16] this pain this this this molding this
[28:19] this this handle that he's made me and
[28:22] I'm gone through
[28:23] this now he can set me aside the Potter
[28:26] will leave me alone
[28:28] no amen you're going into the oven
[28:32] buddy you're going into the oven because
[28:34] we're going to toughen you up amen you
[28:38] that's not the the the soft little pot
[28:41] you know it's got the the the the
[28:43] molding of what it's going to look like
[28:45] but it's not the expected end amen and
[28:49] so in the expected End Amen is for us
[28:52] Amen to go through the fire amen and
[28:55] it's in the fire amen that's going to
[28:57] try us amen it's the fire amen that's
[29:00] going to that's going to keep you or
[29:02] it's going to it's going to keep you
[29:04] there or or or you're going to give up
[29:07] amen because sometimes when the pot goes
[29:09] in the fire it can't handle the fire
[29:12] amen but if the if the Potter has done
[29:14] the right job if it's done exactly what
[29:17] it needed to do that that that pot's
[29:19] going to withstand the fire amen and so
[29:22] we're confident that the the work that
[29:24] God has done in our lives amen he is
[29:27] going to finish it to the coming of the
[29:30] Lord Jesus Christ he is going to finish
[29:33] the work that he started in us
[29:36] hallelujah amen I'm confident in that
[29:39] that I'm expecting that praise God
[29:42] because he has an expected end of me
[29:45] hallelujah amen so don't let sometimes
[29:50] and I say this for everybody amen don't
[29:52] let the fire crack you
[29:56] up the fire is to make you
[29:59] better amen know that the Potter have
[30:04] confidence that what the Potter has done
[30:06] and that he's done a good work in you
[30:09] that you will withstand the fire Amen
[30:12] Let Me Tell You Saints you know we're
[30:14] we're we're all of us Amen brother
[30:16] Brandon talked about a squeeze amen if
[30:20] we if you might be saying well I'm
[30:22] feeling a squeeze right now look at
[30:23] these gas
[30:25] prices squeezing the money and the
[30:28] change everything out of me I just look
[30:30] at and but tell you what there's other
[30:34] there's other things that are coming
[30:36] about that way Beyond gas prices amen
[30:40] and if you can't handle amen problems
[30:42] right now how are you going to handle
[30:43] that amen because it's it's coming the
[30:47] prophet talked about it amen but thank
[30:50] God Amen that we have amen the winner
[30:53] the Victorious One in US amen the one
[30:55] that has molded our lives and has given
[30:58] us the holy ghost that we can conquer
[31:00] amen during that time amen I don't know
[31:03] what's going to
[31:04] happen sometimes I don't even care to
[31:06] know what's going to happen it's so uh
[31:09] daunting and so uhhh overwhelming the
[31:13] things in the media and in the news it's
[31:15] just constant bombarding of something
[31:17] bad happening all the time amen that is
[31:20] trying to lose our focus on the word
[31:23] it's really what it's doing and so amen
[31:26] just stay in the word saint
[31:28] stay in the word stay with the vision of
[31:31] that he has for you praise
[31:33] God so we know that pain amen is part of
[31:37] that Vision that God has for you that
[31:40] expected end pain is part of it amen
[31:44] there's a little story a little story
[31:46] that I was reading one time of a of a of
[31:48] a bear that was that was stuck in a
[31:51] trap and there was a a a a hunter that
[31:55] was going by he was hunting hunting
[31:58] deer and uh he saw the the bear was
[32:01] stuck in the Trap and he went over there
[32:04] to try to grab the bear from the trap
[32:08] and and and and was wanting to help the
[32:10] bear out of the Trap but the bear just
[32:12] would not stay still would not let would
[32:15] not let go just would not let the the
[32:18] hunter do what he needed to do to get
[32:20] him out of the Trap and so the hunter
[32:23] he's like well I have a tranquilizer gun
[32:25] so let me just pull that out and when
[32:27] the bear saw that he went
[32:29] Bonkers and just would not let the the
[32:33] the the the the hunter uh shoot him up
[32:36] with the tranquilizer gun so that he
[32:37] could stay still he had all intentions
[32:40] the the the hunter had all intentions to
[32:43] let him go but the bearer thought that
[32:46] he was doing something bad to him and he
[32:49] was already in a in a in a in in a
[32:51] mess and and so the hunter what he was
[32:54] trying to do he couldn't he couldn't get
[32:57] him to to s still he was trying to press
[32:59] more on that trap amen so the more he
[33:02] would press it would hurt him more but
[33:05] that was the only way that he could
[33:06] loose
[33:07] it and the more it would hurt the the
[33:10] more the bear would try to growl at him
[33:12] the more he would try to bite him and
[33:15] unfortunately the hunter wasn't able to
[33:17] let him
[33:21] L and that's how sometimes we are
[33:24] Saints when problems and situations and
[33:27] Trials Come amen we're like the
[33:29] bear God wants to has given us his word
[33:34] to let set us
[33:36] free I believe every answer that he has
[33:39] for us is in this
[33:41] word this is
[33:43] peace but sometimes we don't think that
[33:45] it
[33:46] is sometimes we think that we can fix
[33:49] the situation ourselves with our own
[33:52] ideas and our own thinking when God has
[33:55] given us a source of peace and he he he
[33:58] is peace and if we turn to him amen and
[34:02] just sit still and let and let let go
[34:04] and let God have his way amen stand
[34:07] still when when when Moses came to the
[34:09] Red Sea what did God told him he said
[34:11] stand
[34:12] still let me take care of the bear
[34:15] trap man let let me pull this out I'll
[34:17] I'll think of something I'll know what
[34:19] to do amen you just stand still and
[34:23] that's what we should do amen and in the
[34:25] hours and The Temptations and the
[34:27] tribulations amen just stand still and
[34:30] see what is it that Lord you are trying
[34:32] to do in my life with this situation
[34:36] with this with this problem amen
[34:39] problems are going to come problems we
[34:41] have them every day but as always say
[34:43] problems are not
[34:46] Eternal problems have a beginning
[34:49] problems have have an end they don't
[34:51] have eternal life I'm so thankful for
[34:54] that amen
[34:57] praise God Psalms 23 1-6 tells us
[35:05] this it says the Lord is my shepherd I
[35:09] shall not want he maketh me lie down in
[35:12] Green Pastures he leadth me beside the
[35:15] Still
[35:16] Waters he restoreth my soul amen praise
[35:20] the Lord Jesus Psalms and and so it
[35:24] continues saying yay though I walk
[35:26] through the valley of the shadow of
[35:28] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[35:32] with me thy rod and thy staff they
[35:35] comfort me amen thou preparest a table
[35:39] before me in the presence of mine
[35:41] enemies thou anointest my head with oil
[35:44] my cup runneth over surely goodness and
[35:46] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[35:50] life and I will dwell in the house of
[35:52] the Lord forever praise God Amen he even
[35:56] though we're walking through the Valley
[35:57] of the shadow of death
[35:59] amen he says we don't have to fear any
[36:02] evil I know that's
[36:06] tough but it takes walking through the
[36:09] valley of the shadow of death to prove
[36:11] whether you're going to fear evil or not
[36:14] otherwise you wouldn't have the
[36:16] opportunity to not fear evil if you
[36:19] didn't go through that Valley amen for
[36:22] thou art with me how many believe God is
[36:24] with you amen how many believe God is in
[36:28] you amen praise God thy rod and thy
[36:32] staff they comfort me amen praise the
[36:35] lord it's like the word it Comforts us
[36:37] amen praise God you know let's talk
[36:40] about the permissive will and the
[36:42] perfect will of God you know sometimes
[36:44] God allows us sometimes he allows us to
[36:47] make a fool of ourselves amen before we
[36:49] can understand his perfect will for our
[36:51] lives
[36:53] amen and and and it makes me think of uh
[36:56] of of that of that uh one door that that
[36:59] oneway mouse trap that that has the door
[37:03] that opens amen and the mouse goes in
[37:06] and he thinks that he's got it
[37:08] made but he can't come
[37:10] out and you as the homeowner
[37:16] yes but he is in there like I can't get
[37:20] out and I had the piece of cheese right
[37:22] there or the PE the peanut butter you
[37:24] know ready to go you know and God allows
[37:26] us sometimes amen that we go we go
[37:28] through that one-way door amen so he
[37:31] allows it he allows us so you can see
[37:33] the foolishness in your life amen
[37:37] sometimes we're just foolish in the way
[37:39] we think and in the way we talk he's
[37:41] like okay go ahead go right through
[37:44] there and you'll see that you won't be
[37:45] able to get out thinking the way you're
[37:48] thinking amen instead of holding on to
[37:50] my word and putting all your your your
[37:55] faith in the word amen
[37:58] because your ideas and my ideas your
[38:00] opinions and my opinions amen don't mean
[38:03] nothing for before God as long as they
[38:06] align amen with the word amen they're
[38:09] you're good to go you could you'll be
[38:11] able to get out of that mouse trap amen
[38:14] but if they don't align with the word of
[38:16] God you're stuck and you're going to dep
[38:19] Lord you take me out of here I can't do
[38:21] it I I can't I can't I can't I I've
[38:25] tried I I've done it all all everything
[38:27] that I could on my end Lord you the one
[38:29] who's able to open and you know what
[38:32] that Mouse can be freed from that mouse
[38:34] trap if the owner all he has to do is
[38:36] just open the door
[38:39] himself and the mouse can walk right
[38:42] out right but now if the mouse is
[38:45] sitting there leaning against the
[38:47] door you know trying to get out trying
[38:50] to get out the owner won't be able to
[38:53] open the door and sometimes that's what
[38:55] we do we're saying they're just leaning
[38:57] leaning on our own
[39:00] understanding leaning on our own
[39:02] opinions leaning on on our on what we
[39:05] think it's right amen and God is not
[39:08] able to open that door for you to be
[39:10] released free Amen in his in his word
[39:15] amen so let's not get stuck in the mouse
[39:19] trap in the spiritual mouse trap praise
[39:23] God Amen I it reminds me also of when
[39:26] when brother Brandon was lost how many
[39:28] read the story when brother Brandon was
[39:30] lost in the
[39:31] woods he took his wife a hunt a hunting
[39:34] for a hun mooon and Billy Paul was there
[39:37] with him and he thought that he could
[39:39] kill two birds with one stone because he
[39:42] was a Trapper he was a hunter I mean and
[39:44] and he was also a husband and a father
[39:47] and I mean he just thought he had it
[39:49] made everything was was I mean he was
[39:52] Unstoppable a amen and and and and when
[39:56] he got up there and
[39:58] he got lost he couldn't find his way
[40:01] back down to the mountain Amen to get
[40:04] back to his family to get back to his
[40:06] wife to get back to his son and there he
[40:08] was getting worried because he was said
[40:11] that he was he in his testimony he was
[40:13] given you you can go back and read it in
[40:15] the message uh a guide or and uh and
[40:19] he's uh he's there right walking around
[40:22] and he calls it the Indian death walk
[40:24] and so he's there doing circles and
[40:26] doing circles and and finally he gets to
[40:28] a point where he gets afraid and he
[40:32] realizes that he is not as as as tough
[40:36] and as strong and as he thought that he
[40:40] was and God allowed him to be in that
[40:43] position so that he could realize that
[40:46] he was limited in what he could do and
[40:50] sometimes God allows us Amen to get in
[40:52] positions in our lives so that we
[40:54] realize that you are not capable AP of
[40:57] changing every
[40:59] situation amen you and I can't amen but
[41:03] God can and God has the expected end for
[41:07] everything and everybody amen praise the
[41:10] Lord Jesus amen so God knew exactly
[41:14] where brother brandham was at and how to
[41:17] get him out of that situation amen but
[41:20] God wanted brother brandom to realize
[41:22] that amen so he had him walking in
[41:24] circles for
[41:26] hours until finally he said Lord I just
[41:29] he prayed and just listening to a
[41:31] testimony and his testimony he said he
[41:33] just prayed and when he and said Lord
[41:36] you guide me I can't do it on my own he
[41:38] looked up and he said I'm just going to
[41:40] take this direction and when he did he
[41:43] said something stopped him and got
[41:46] touched him in the back and said go this
[41:48] way because that was after he gave up
[41:53] his own thinking his own understanding
[41:56] and let go go and let again God was able
[41:58] to guide him amen he was able to guide
[42:00] him down to the line to the electrical
[42:03] line and using that electrical line and
[42:05] he was able to get down to the bottom of
[42:07] the mountain to everything that he loved
[42:10] his wife and his family amen praise the
[42:13] Lord Jesus so God allows us Amen to go
[42:17] through pains and sufferings in our
[42:19] lives so that we can recognize that God
[42:22] is our only help
[42:24] amen that we can let him lead us
[42:28] otherwise we just continue in our own
[42:30] stubborn ways amen praise the lord we
[42:34] can look at the life of Peter amen Peter
[42:37] walking on water and and he
[42:40] sinks but at least he walked on water
[42:44] amen but he sunk when he was looking at
[42:46] the his his problems amen Peter also
[42:49] rebuked Jesus one time did you know that
[42:52] he said Lord no you're not going to uh
[42:56] you know you're not going to die you're
[42:58] you're going to be here always amen he
[43:00] got rebuked by
[43:01] Jesus and said no it's not your will
[43:04] it's my will let my will be done amen
[43:08] praise the
[43:09] Lord and then Peter of course denies
[43:12] Jesus after he said he
[43:14] wouldn't a big bad
[43:16] Peter you
[43:18] know he said no I'll never deny you Lord
[43:22] and that was what he did because why God
[43:27] ultimately is his will amen his perfect
[43:30] will praise the Lord and he'll allow us
[43:32] to walk in permissive will for a while
[43:34] but eventually it would lead us to his
[43:37] perfect will amen praise God Amen as
[43:41] parents we have to let our children
[43:42] suffer sometimes did you know
[43:46] that yeah just let them suffer sometimes
[43:50] amen they may not understand it at the
[43:52] moment they but in in time they will let
[43:56] them suffer let let Let Them Fall let
[43:58] let them let them do so obviously you
[44:00] know you know uh the limit because
[44:03] you're the adult let them let let them
[44:06] go through that then they realize okay
[44:09] it's not as um as wonderful as I thought
[44:13] it'd
[44:14] be you know there's pain that goes
[44:17] behind it it's like the story that the
[44:19] the little story that that brother Eric
[44:20] told here about about his son when about
[44:23] touching the
[44:24] fire you know he realized then if he
[44:27] touched that flame it was hot amen and
[44:30] so that's what sometimes our kids need
[44:32] to know for our for themselves you know
[44:34] if you try to just keep them covered
[44:37] from everything they'll never learn
[44:38] anything in life right amen they'll
[44:42] never know anything in life and and and
[44:44] and and and they'll just be just stuck
[44:48] in a room forever and won't ever want to
[44:50] go out to out there in the world
[44:52] Amen and you're you're doing more damage
[44:55] to them by doing that you're harming
[44:57] them as a parent see God doesn't want to
[45:00] deal like that with us that's why he
[45:02] allows you to make mistakes he allows
[45:05] you to go ahead Peter deny me because I
[45:10] said I know you would he allows you Amen
[45:13] to make the mistake so that you realize
[45:15] that you're not on all control but he is
[45:18] amen praise God hallelujah I'm going
[45:21] skip skip this here amen Hebrews
[45:24] 5 amen
[45:28] see if we are children of God Amen we
[45:31] will learn what God needs for us to
[45:33] learn by what we suffer look what
[45:36] brother brandham says here in this
[45:38] quote I know you all have read this
[45:40] quote before he says he says in the
[45:43] sperian church age why does he stand by
[45:47] speaking of God the reason is in Romans
[45:51] 817- 18 and if children then heirs Heirs
[45:55] of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so
[45:59] be that that we suffer with
[46:02] him when you became a Christian he
[46:04] didn't say that you're never going to
[46:06] suffer he already told you in the Bible
[46:07] that you were going to suffer so that's
[46:10] an expected end that's expected amen if
[46:14] so be that we suffer with him that we
[46:17] may also with that suffering be
[46:20] glorified together amen for I reckon
[46:23] that the sufferings of this present time
[46:27] are not worthy to be compared with the
[46:30] glory which shall be revealed not over
[46:33] us but in US amen because the work is
[46:37] From the Inside Out
[46:38] hallelujah amen and then he continues to
[46:41] say this unless we suffer can you all
[46:45] read that okay unless we suffer with him
[46:49] who Christ we cannot reign with him so
[46:54] if everything is easy and honky door in
[46:57] your life you are not a candidate to
[46:59] reign with Jesus because Jesus
[47:02] suffered amen you have to suffer to
[47:06] rain the reason for this is that
[47:10] character simply is never made without
[47:15] suffering you want to have character in
[47:17] your life right you're going to
[47:21] suffer suffer
[47:23] away but Christ has suffered already for
[47:26] you
[47:27] amen so he knows what you're going
[47:30] through because we all want character we
[47:33] all want want to be like Jesus but we
[47:35] don't want to suffer like
[47:38] Jesus character is a
[47:42] victory and not a gift we don't come
[47:45] here to this world with character in our
[47:48] lives amen it is built upon your life's
[47:51] experiences right A Man Without
[47:54] character can't reain because power
[47:58] apart from character is
[48:01] satanic but Power with character is fit
[48:06] to rule
[48:08] Hallelujah so character is important in
[48:10] our lives right how many how many
[48:13] believe that character is important get
[48:16] ready to
[48:17] suffer
[48:19] suffer but suffer for the Lord
[48:24] amen and since he wants us to share even
[48:28] his throne on the same basis that he
[48:32] overcame the reason why he overcame is
[48:35] because he suffered and they sat down in
[48:37] his father's Throne then we we have to
[48:41] overcome to sit with
[48:43] him and the little temporary suffering
[48:46] we go through now is not worthy to be
[48:50] compared to the tremendous Glory that
[48:53] will be revealed in us when he comes oh
[48:57] what Treasures are laid up for those who
[48:59] are willing to enter into his kingdom
[49:03] through much
[49:04] tribulation
[49:07] W so we've got to have tribulation in
[49:10] our lives amen so these are four
[49:12] blessings that come from Pain one it
[49:16] often brings us to
[49:19] repentance when you have pain you start
[49:22] checking your life Lord where have I
[49:25] failed you what do I need to do to draw
[49:27] closer to God so that is one of the
[49:30] purposes that God allows pain in our
[49:32] lives and that God and that God puts
[49:36] allows trials in our lives trials drive
[49:38] us to our knees instead of to despair CS
[49:41] Lewis he wrote and said pain is God's
[49:45] megaphone to Rouse a deaf
[49:48] World a megaphone you know like a
[49:53] bullhorn so God allows painful and
[49:56] hurtful situations in our lives Amen to
[49:59] Rouse you to draw you closer to him not
[50:04] to not not to separate you from God he
[50:07] doesn't not allow pain in your life so
[50:08] that you can walk away from God he
[50:10] allows pain in your life so that you can
[50:12] come closer to him
[50:15] amen Another Blessing that comes from
[50:17] pain is pain and hurt strengthen our
[50:20] faith it can break us or build us amen I
[50:25] put there like a seed falling on the
[50:27] rock or in in the middle or in the
[50:29] middle of the Thorns you see so that
[50:32] pain it can either break you or whatever
[50:35] or it can it can mold you it can make
[50:37] you a better Christian amen God wants
[50:40] the latter praise the Lord Another
[50:43] Blessing is that hard times increase the
[50:46] effectiveness of our witness a person
[50:49] going through drug rehab becomes an
[50:52] empathetic
[50:53] counselor amen a person that that has
[50:56] been in the the streets that has been in
[50:58] drugs that has that has has lived the
[51:01] life of the streets knows how to be able
[51:03] to help another person that's going
[51:05] through the same situation so if you've
[51:07] never experienced any hardship in your
[51:09] life you won't ever be able to help
[51:11] anybody else in that same hardship amen
[51:15] so we've got to have pain because the
[51:17] pain is not just for us it's for also to
[51:20] affect the others around us praise the
[51:23] Lord PA Paul spoke effectively to the
[51:26] Pharisees because he used to be a
[51:28] Pharisee amen praise the Lord and and
[51:32] the fourth blessing is that it helps us
[51:34] to step back and look at the big picture
[51:38] and that God truly is in control amen it
[51:43] helps us to look look look at the whole
[51:45] picture and say Lord what is the
[51:47] ultimate goal amen behind this what is
[51:51] the ultimate
[51:52] goal and that's very important because
[51:55] sometimes we're just very
[51:57] narrow-minded and we get we we we we get
[52:00] used to the routine and we get used to
[52:03] the to the to just how things are at one
[52:06] point and and God wants to expand your
[52:08] vision God wants to expand your your
[52:11] your
[52:12] horizon Amen to look amen at what at
[52:16] what God has in store for you but you
[52:18] can't see what God has in store for you
[52:20] if you got blinders on right and he's
[52:23] got he's got something right here ready
[52:25] for you amen see I can't see that water
[52:28] right
[52:29] now and and I'm I'm a little thirsty but
[52:32] see if I if I got these blinders on I I
[52:34] can't I won't be able to benefit from
[52:36] the water CU I won't know the water is
[52:38] there and it's right there and because
[52:41] it's right there I'm going to take a
[52:45] sip I hope you're enjoying this
[52:48] tonight maybe it wasn't what you came to
[52:50] look a little for
[52:52] but amen what we talking about is peace
[52:55] shalom praise the Lord amen we're
[52:59] finishing up brother brandom says here
[53:01] and I guess if I want to if I want to
[53:03] finish it is is is let's finish it with
[53:07] with what brother brandham said amen
[53:10] this is what brother brandham says in
[53:11] the message Shalom he preached two this
[53:14] was in January 12th 1964 and then he
[53:17] preached another one January 19th the
[53:19] same year and he says and remember when
[53:21] the full Bible listen in closing when
[53:24] this full Bible has been thoroughly a
[53:28] Vindicated then there will be an eternal
[53:31] Shalom an eternal peace amen what is he
[53:35] saying in other words when the full word
[53:37] has been fully uh uh Vindicated or or or
[53:42] or fulfilled amen because nothing is
[53:46] going to go amen Jesus said this world
[53:50] will not pass until every jot every TI
[53:53] every eye is dotted everything
[53:56] passes exactly the way he thought about
[53:59] it the expected end that he had
[54:02] amen nothing's going to end until that's
[54:06] when an eternal Shalom will be praise
[54:09] God how many would desire that Eternal
[54:11] Shalom Eternal peace but you got to have
[54:15] the Eternal Peacemaker inside of you
[54:17] first amen if you don't have the Eternal
[54:19] Peacemaker inside of you you're not
[54:21] going to be able to enjoy the Eternal
[54:23] peace out here cuz you won't be there
[54:26] I'm sorry to say you won't be there to
[54:29] enjoy that Eternal peace so enjoy the
[54:31] Eternal peace maker right now praise God

[55:28] he wants me to live so that I can see
[55:31] them praise God but there's more word to
[55:35] be a Vindicated brother brandham says
[55:37] he's got to vindicate more word and when
[55:41] the last word is Vindicated is
[55:44] Vindicated rather then death is
[55:46] swallowed up in Victory Hallelujah and
[55:50] the dead in Christ shall rise amen the
[55:54] Millennium will set in and it'll will be
[55:56] one great peace Shalom amen why because

[1:06:32] preached himself into that place so by
[1:06:35] the grace of God let's do the same thing
[1:06:38] let's honor brother Dale by doing what
[1:06:39] he said doing what the word said cuz
[1:06:42] like brother Louise said he loved the
[1:06:43] word of God he loved a message of the
[1:06:46] hour more than anybody probably I've
[1:06:47] ever known he he he dug in when some
[1:06:50] didn't want to dig in he preached some
[1:06:52] things sometime people didn't want to
[1:06:54] preach but he did did such a good job
[1:06:56] doing it he's left us a legacy he he's
[1:06:59] left us something to look forward
[1:07:02] to I told June today and I we hadn't
[1:07:05] cried much and we were looking each

[1:11:05] it a Joy's time it is sad but let's make
[1:11:07] it a Joy's time let's um let's move
[1:11:11] forward remember I told you brother
[1:11:13] Dell's greatest gift you could ever give
[1:11:15] him is to do what he
[1:11:16] says do what he walk into what he
[1:11:19] preached amen if you walk into what he
[1:11:22] preached he's a he's the happiest man in
[1:11:24] the world
[1:11:26] you can give him gifts that that means a
[1:11:29] lot but what did he take with him he
[1:11:30] didn't take gifts with him over across
[1:11:32] the other side he took what was in his
[1:11:34] heart and what he preached he took it
[1:11:36] with him let me tell you one let me tell
[1:11:39] you two things before we leave and I'll
[1:11:41] be telling probably
[1:11:42] Saturday dad in 1998 when I came back to
[1:11:46] the Lord um and I know he told it here
[1:11:49] some he told a
[1:11:52] dream and um he um he told a dream that
[1:11:57] that he saw a spaceship I know some of
[1:12:00] younger ones won't remember this his own
[1:12:01] tape probably in in the '90s
[1:12:03] but he had a vision or a dream that
[1:12:06] there was a spaceship come over his come
[1:12:09] over his head and landed on a
[1:12:13] hill landed on a hill and the lights
[1:12:16] were on you know and dad said remember
[1:12:19] in the dream he's helping people up that
[1:12:21] hill helping them pulling them pushing
[1:12:25] them up to get in that spaceship and
[1:12:29] they all got in the spaceship except
[1:12:33] him is that him it left without him well
[1:12:37] now we all going to leave without him
[1:12:39] but I believe he's got a group of people
[1:12:41] that he put in that spaceship that's
[1:12:43] going to bring that man back to Earth in
[1:12:46] a glorified
[1:12:47] body and about 3 months ago and I was
[1:12:51] telling brother Luis I have dreams but
[1:12:54] some of them you couldn't tell by the
[1:12:55] pull pit don't you can laugh cuz you've
[1:12:57] had the same ones and you don't know
[1:12:59] where in the world that came from so I'm
[1:13:01] not a hard dreamer but I had a dream
[1:13:03] about 3 months
[1:13:04] ago and the vision popped open and and I
[1:13:08] was sitting in a like a
[1:13:09] booth and it was all white behind me and
[1:13:12] I turned and put my arm up over the
[1:13:13] booth like this and I turned it look
[1:13:15] like over the the white banister and
[1:13:19] here come a man
[1:13:23] walking there's a picture of me him
[1:13:25] holding me he was 20 years old he was
[1:13:28] almost 20 when I was born in January he
[1:13:31] was 20 in um April so he was 19 when I
[1:13:35] was born and it's a picture of him
[1:13:37] holding me on the back of a of a
[1:13:39] Chevrolet um truck a car and it was I
[1:13:43] was about 6 months old so he would have
[1:13:44] been right at 20 years old and that was
[1:13:46] the exact man that walked up black
[1:13:51] hair tall
[1:13:53] skinny and he always smiled a lot of
[1:13:55] times like
[1:13:57] this and he was just smiling looked at
[1:13:59] me and smiled and then the vision
[1:14:03] left don't
[1:14:05] worry he's more alive than we are
[1:14:08] now and he left that old pest house and
[1:14:10] that's what we're going to put in the
[1:14:12] ground but he will be back all right
[1:14:16] I'll promise
[1:14:17] you he'll be back but he's left us a
[1:14:20] good Legacy and and there's no way I can
[1:14:22] fill his
[1:14:23] shoes I don't want to
[1:14:25] I want him to have his own shoes his own
[1:14:28] legacy but I just want to be able to
