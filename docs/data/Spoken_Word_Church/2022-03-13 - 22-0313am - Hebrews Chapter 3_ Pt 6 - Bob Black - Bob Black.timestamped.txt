[0:05] god bless you thanks and good morning
[0:12] trying to get used to all this fancy new
[0:14] equipment and everything this is this is
[0:15] awesome
[0:23] all right we're on uh hebrews chapter
[0:25] three looking at the i think we're
[0:28] almost done with the provocation part of
[0:30] it
[0:31] let's just let's just pray before we get
[0:32] into this lord god we're so grateful to
[0:34] be able to gather together and we just
[0:35] ask your blessing as we look into the
[0:37] word and study these things out and i
[0:38] pray lord that you just bless brother
[0:40] wade for the service this morning and
[0:41] this afternoon lord as we come expecting
[0:44] granite lord in the name of the lord
[0:45] jesus amen
[0:48] so let's just read
[0:50] uh through a few of these
[0:52] um verses where we kind of left off last
[0:54] time hard not your heart says in the
[0:56] provocation and the day of temptation in
[0:58] the wilderness
[0:59] when your fathers tempted me prove me
[1:01] and saw my works forty years
[1:04] wherefore i was grieved with that
[1:05] generation and said they do always air
[1:07] in their heart and they have not known
[1:08] my ways so i swear in my wrath they
[1:10] shall not enter into my rest
[1:14] so that's what we're going to in hebrews
[1:16] chapter 4
[1:17] is the rest to see what see what that
[1:19] what what that's about
[1:21] take heed brethren lest there be in any
[1:23] of you an evil heart of unbelief i see
[1:26] where he's placing unbelief is in your
[1:28] heart so that's that's where it all
[1:30] stems from as if you
[1:33] your faith and doubt starts in your
[1:34] heart
[1:35] and departing from the living god but
[1:37] exhort one another daily while it is
[1:39] called today
[1:40] lest any of you be hardened through the
[1:42] deceitfulness of sin now exhort one
[1:44] another means to constantly be
[1:46] be uh
[1:47] we're trying to help one another because
[1:49] we're all we're all
[1:50] going to try trying to get to that place
[1:53] of rest where we have where we can
[1:56] have confidence in what we believe and
[1:57] be resting in in christ so we exhort one
[2:00] another daily poking and prodding at one
[2:03] another and and moving along
[2:06] so in verse 14 it says for we are made
[2:08] partakers of christ if we hold the
[2:09] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[2:11] unto the end
[2:13] while it is said today if you will hear
[2:16] his voice harden not your hearts as in
[2:18] the provocation
[2:20] for some when they had heard did provoke
[2:22] howbeit not all that came out of egypt
[2:24] by moses but with whom was he grieved 40
[2:26] years was it not with them that had
[2:28] sinned whose carcasses fell in the
[2:30] wilderness
[2:31] and to whoms where he that they should
[2:32] not enter into his rest but to them that
[2:34] believe not so we see that they cannot
[2:36] enter in
[2:37] because of unbelief
[2:40] now brother brahma said and why it had
[2:41] to be shepherd and we we read this last
[2:43] time he said now that uh
[2:45] all israel did not receive the prophet
[2:47] shepherd's word all of israel didn't
[2:49] receive it he said now notice they was
[2:51] complaining oh when he was performing
[2:53] the miracles he was a great fellow but
[2:54] when it come to his message
[2:56] that was different
[2:58] all great signs follows a new message
[3:00] coming
[3:01] we know that in the wilderness they
[3:03] complained in the wilderness and died by
[3:05] the thousands
[3:06] frankly there wasn't only two of them
[3:08] that ever went through that was saved
[3:10] out of a two and a half million two out
[3:12] of two and a half million you say what
[3:14] happened to them they're eternally gone
[3:17] all of them brother branham jesus said
[3:19] so they said our fathers he manna in the
[3:22] wilderness
[3:23] and they drank from the rock and he
[3:25] jesus said and they are everyone dead
[3:28] eternally separated see everyone
[3:32] and why why were they why are they so we
[3:35] will talk about death here just for for
[3:37] a few minutes why were they separated
[3:38] from the fellowship of god because of
[3:40] their unbelief
[3:42] they failed to believe and you see how
[3:44] sometimes unbelief can sneak up on us
[3:46] they they failed to believe they failed
[3:48] to recognize what their purpose was that
[3:50] their purpose was to go into the
[3:51] promised land if your purpose is to go
[3:53] into the promised land and then god's
[3:55] going to take care of everything else
[3:56] leading up to it when they get thirsty
[3:58] god's going to give you a rock to drink
[4:00] from when they get hungry guys are going
[4:01] to give you food
[4:02] when they when they got into a rough
[4:04] spot when they got to bitter waters
[4:06] god's going to take care of that if you
[4:07] just if you'll just trust and so so many
[4:10] times we'll lose sight of what our
[4:11] purpose is
[4:12] you're the church has been the bride has
[4:14] been commissioned to cast out devils
[4:16] we've been commissioned to to to
[4:18] overcome
[4:20] we've been commissioned to tear down
[4:21] strongholds to tear down idols and if we
[4:23] lose sight of what that is then then we
[4:26] begin to we begin to you can see how
[4:28] even in a morning in christian's life
[4:30] you can begin to start faltered the
[4:32] devil
[4:32] the devil we'll read a quote here in a
[4:34] minute where in the greatest battle ever
[4:35] fall the devil wants to to try to for to
[4:39] get you to doubt what you've got to
[4:42] doubt what you have access to and to
[4:44] disbelieve that that you've got a sword
[4:46] in your hand
[4:48] now so so you see where death comes from
[4:50] death
[4:51] comes from disbelieving god's word
[4:56] now in john chapter 6 jesus said verily
[4:59] verily i say unto you he that believeth
[5:01] on me hath everlasting life
[5:03] i am that bread of life now so he's he's
[5:06] tying himself back to that manner that
[5:08] they ate from in the wilderness your
[5:10] fathers did eat manna in the wilderness
[5:12] and are dead
[5:14] so they they they ate man in the
[5:16] wilderness and they in other words they
[5:18] went to church and they did all the
[5:19] things that you know
[5:21] you know so-called christian would do
[5:23] and everything
[5:24] but yet they failed to believe what god
[5:26] had given them
[5:28] and it and and see that how that ties
[5:30] back with with what eve did in the
[5:32] garden of eden
[5:34] of the tree of the knowledge of good and
[5:35] evil thou shalt not eat of it god told
[5:37] them for in the day that thou eat is
[5:39] thereof thou shalt surely die
[5:44] now you can see that that the devil the
[5:46] devil is a liar and you know and so
[5:48] we're going to examine that a little bit
[5:50] this morning because brother ram you
[5:51] know he in the friend when he preached
[5:53] the first seal he talked about how that
[5:54] that
[5:55] that is that how the devil twisted that
[5:58] thou shalt not surely die he twisted
[6:00] that and it became the lie
[6:02] and we'll see how you know really
[6:05] it it could come become really easy to
[6:07] slip over into into taking something
[6:10] that the devil throws at you and saying
[6:11] well uh you know that's not so bad
[6:14] that's that doesn't sound so bad
[6:16] now listen to what brother brown said in
[6:18] oneness he said now when adam and eve
[6:19] and again the whole context of what
[6:21] we're talking about is the provocation
[6:22] in the wilderness the reason why they
[6:24] couldn't go under rest because because
[6:26] they they disbelieved they got caught up
[6:28] in their own ideas and looking back to
[6:29] egypt
[6:30] thinking that they were better off then
[6:32] than they were now discounting the the
[6:35] leadership that god had given them
[6:36] saying i directed let's let's just elect
[6:38] our own captain let's let's let's just
[6:40] uh we want somebody else to lead us than
[6:43] the leadership of the holy spirit
[6:45] brother raymond in message oneness he
[6:47] said now when adam and eve listened to
[6:48] the lie of the devil
[6:50] the holy image of god left them their
[6:52] fellowship was broken with god their
[6:54] fellowship of oneness with god was
[6:56] broken
[6:57] the very minute they listened to the lie
[6:59] of the devil
[7:01] that broke their fellowship
[7:03] and the very minute that you listen to
[7:04] the lie of the devil
[7:06] it'll break your fellowship
[7:08] that's the very minute that you go out
[7:10] from the presence of god like she did is
[7:12] when you fail to take god's word just as
[7:16] it is
[7:23] now in genesis
[7:26] make sure i got my slides here
[7:30] in genesis you know we just read that of
[7:32] the tree of good knowledge of good and
[7:33] evil
[7:34] don't don't eat it but you'll surely die
[7:36] and the serpent just twists he just
[7:37] added one word to it and the serpent
[7:39] said unto the woman you shall not surely
[7:41] die
[7:42] now now you see what what happens when
[7:44] you when you add one word or take one
[7:46] word it what it what it does is it
[7:48] changes the meaning
[7:50] you know you can you when we when we
[7:52] think of one word off or we lose our
[7:54] fellowship
[7:55] you can almost get into like a nervous
[7:57] nervous situation where you're you you
[7:59] know
[8:00] one word off let's let's think about
[8:02] what that means one word off the hebrews
[8:03] could say the jews would say well you've
[8:05] got to understand the hebrew the
[8:07] original hebrew to get it exactly right
[8:10] or you've got to you've you gotta go
[8:11] back to the original greek and get it
[8:13] exactly right and and and you can kind
[8:15] of belabor that point but but really
[8:17] what we're talking about is the meaning
[8:19] when when when the devil added one word
[8:21] when satan added one word or when he
[8:23] takes one word it changes that
[8:25] underlying meaning
[8:27] but that's why brother i listed out all
[8:29] the all the places where he said a word
[8:31] what a word is he said a word is a
[8:33] thought expressed
[8:36] a word is a thought made manifest
[8:39] when god thinks anything in his mind and
[8:42] then when he expresses it it's eternal
[8:45] so so think about this the one word off
[8:48] where does it start from it starts from
[8:50] your thinking it starts from the
[8:52] revelation of what that thing is or the
[8:54] the understanding of what it is so when
[8:57] the devil added one word to it it
[8:58] changes changed the meaning
[9:01] god thought it then when he expressed
[9:03] that it has to happen for the world was
[9:05] framed by the word of god
[9:07] a word is a thought expressed you have
[9:10] to think it before you express it
[9:13] now a word is a thought expressed it's a
[9:16] thought first you think it then you
[9:19] speak it amen that's why in chapter in
[9:21] luke chapter 6
[9:23] jesus taught us that a good man out of
[9:25] the good treasure of his heart
[9:27] bringeth forth that which is good
[9:29] and an evil man out of the evil treasure
[9:32] of his heart
[9:33] bringeth forth that which is evil for
[9:35] the abundance of the heart his mouth
[9:38] speaketh
[9:39] now you see the problem of the of the
[9:42] the children of israel in the wilderness
[9:44] was they started thinking they started
[9:46] thinking wrong they started thinking
[9:48] they needed a different leader they
[9:49] started thinking that the
[9:51] giants were too big they started
[9:52] thinking and then when they started
[9:54] thinking they started speaking
[9:57] we need another leader we need uh
[9:59] moses who do you think you are to lead
[10:01] us and and and all so i once you start
[10:04] thinking wrong you start speaking wrong
[10:07] now now let's examine this and i don't
[10:09] know if you can read that just if you
[10:11] can't see it i'll just
[10:13] i'll just i'll just listen
[10:16] in first corinthians chapter 2 verse 12
[10:18] says now we have received not the spirit
[10:21] of the world but the spirit which is of
[10:23] god that we might know
[10:25] know
[10:26] the things that are freely given to us
[10:28] of god which things also we speak so now
[10:32] that you know you can speak
[10:35] not in the words now now see what what
[10:37] the point remember the point i'm trying
[10:38] to make is
[10:39] i i if you to be one word off starts
[10:43] starts in your mind
[10:44] starts in your thinking
[10:47] which things also we speak not in the
[10:49] words which man's wisdom teacheth
[10:52] but which the holy ghost teacheth
[10:54] comparing spiritual things with
[10:56] spiritual
[10:57] but the natural man receiveth not the
[10:59] things of the spirit of god
[11:01] for they are foolishness unto him
[11:03] neither can he know them because they
[11:05] are spiritually
[11:07] discerned now there's that word
[11:09] discerned to know right from wrong now
[11:11] see go back to eve standing there the
[11:14] reason why she was she listened to the
[11:16] devil's lies because she lost sight of
[11:18] what her purpose was she wanted to jump
[11:20] the gun and and have more wisdom than
[11:22] than adam or even to to have to know the
[11:25] secret and and think about how almost
[11:28] strange that would be to go listen to a
[11:30] beast
[11:31] plowing in the field or whatever doing
[11:33] menial labor
[11:35] while they're walking in the cool of the
[11:37] evening with god every evening or you
[11:39] know god would come down and talk to
[11:41] them but she wanted to go out it felt
[11:42] like she had to go out and get some some
[11:45] secret revelation from from their from
[11:48] their gardener that wasn't even human
[11:51] and and
[11:53] she that's lacking discernment
[11:56] to be able to know truth from from false
[12:00] but he that is spiritual it says
[12:03] judgeth all things
[12:05] he that is spiritual judgeth all things
[12:07] what are you judging by you're judging
[12:09] by the word to know what is right and
[12:11] wrong
[12:13] yet he himself is judged of no man for
[12:15] who hath known the mind of the lord that
[12:18] we may and that he may instruct him
[12:21] but we have the mind of christ
[12:24] so that's how that's how you keep things
[12:27] straight is by having an understanding
[12:29] that you know you can get so much in
[12:31] like a nervous frustration or how how
[12:33] how do we
[12:34] if i'm if i misplace one little thing
[12:36] but if you have a if if it's revealed to
[12:39] you
[12:40] if it's revealed to you the right words
[12:42] will be spoken
[12:43] if it's if you have a revelation now
[12:45] let's let's let's dive in a little bit
[12:47] more
[12:48] in romans chapter 12
[12:50] it says and be not conformed to this
[12:52] world but be transformed
[12:55] by the renewing of your mind
[12:57] so as you eat the word
[12:59] your thinking is actually changed
[13:02] so that when you look at circumstances
[13:04] you're not swayed by them like like a
[13:07] goliath rising up or or how they would
[13:09] say that the the land does devour it
[13:11] will devour us when they saw the
[13:13] promised land that you're not going to
[13:15] be swayed by that because your thinking
[13:17] has changed and instead of looking at
[13:18] the circumstance you're looking at god's
[13:20] word
[13:21] in hebrews 11 it says now now hebrews 11
[13:24] we're going to jump over there and
[13:26] we'll get to there eventually but look
[13:27] how they
[13:28] all of these all of these saints
[13:30] considered
[13:32] they didn't just go in with like a blank
[13:34] slate mind but they thought about it
[13:37] in their mind they thought and they they
[13:39] reasoned out whether these things could
[13:41] be true
[13:42] through faith sarah received strength
[13:44] the conceived seed and she was delivered
[13:46] and was delivered of a child when she
[13:48] was past stage because she judged
[13:51] she judged him faithful who had promised
[13:54] and hebrews 11 19 accounting that god
[13:57] was able to raise him up abraham even
[13:59] for
[14:00] abraham talking about isaac even from
[14:02] the dead from whence also he received
[14:04] him in a figure
[14:06] and hebrews 11 24 to 26 by faith moses
[14:09] when he was come to years refused to be
[14:11] called the son of abraham's daughter
[14:13] choosing rather to choosing rather to
[14:15] suffer affliction with the people of god
[14:17] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[14:19] season esteeming the reproach of christ
[14:22] greater riches than the treasures in
[14:24] egypt
[14:25] in other words these people thought
[14:26] about it they reason if god was able to
[14:29] deliver me from all of these things that
[14:31] in my past brought me from point a to
[14:33] point b this far then he's able to carry
[14:35] me on to the end
[14:39] now now look look how
[14:42] you we're talking about one word off
[14:43] look
[14:44] go ye therefore jesus taught in matthew
[14:46] 28 go go you therefore and teach all
[14:48] nations baptizing them in the name of
[14:50] the father and of the son and of the
[14:51] holy ghost
[14:53] now peter on the day of pentecost didn't
[14:56] just repeat those words but he he had a
[14:58] supernatural understanding in other
[15:01] words his thinking had been changed he
[15:04] thought he knew he knew how what it was
[15:07] and so because he knew he was able to
[15:10] speak it
[15:11] and peter said unto them repent and be
[15:13] baptized every one of you in the name of
[15:15] jesus christ for the remission of sins
[15:17] and you shall receive the gift of the
[15:19] holy ghost
[15:21] you know maybe maybe just consider you
[15:23] know how are we going to come to a
[15:25] speaking condition where we can speak
[15:26] the word
[15:28] is because we will come to a place where
[15:30] we know what god wants done with the
[15:32] word
[15:33] where we know
[15:35] not because we've just memorized a lot
[15:36] of scriptures in our mind but we have an
[15:38] understanding of those scriptures the
[15:40] meaning that's what i'm talking about
[15:42] the meaning here
[15:44] now you you think about how easy
[15:47] well let's here's another example
[15:50] in matthew chapter 16 and and i know you
[15:53] there's a little small to read but um
[15:55] so i'll just i'll just kind of tell the
[15:57] story at the beginning of of this of
[15:59] this story
[16:01] jesus asked the disciples who who do you
[16:03] say that i am and and simon peter said
[16:05] thou art the christ the son of the
[16:06] living god and and peter gave him the
[16:09] jesus told him all these things about
[16:11] flesh and blood has not revealed it unto
[16:12] thee and but my father which is in
[16:14] heaven but but uh go a little bit longer
[16:17] down you keep reading
[16:19] and jesus began to tell him how he was
[16:21] going to suffer and die on the cross and
[16:23] and and and peter began to rebuke him
[16:26] now now see peter did not have an
[16:28] understanding he didn't have a
[16:30] revelation
[16:31] and so jesus turned and rebuked him and
[16:34] said get me get thee behind me satan
[16:37] now right after jesus had had that great
[16:39] or peter had that wonderful confession
[16:41] of of thou art the christ the son of the
[16:43] living god right after that jesus turns
[16:45] around and rebukes him
[16:47] and says get thee behind me satan
[16:49] you see how how deceptive a lie can be a
[16:52] lie because peter did not have the
[16:54] understanding he didn't have he didn't
[16:56] know the meaning of of jesus's life his
[16:59] purpose of his life was to die for us
[17:02] and so peter not being inspired by the
[17:04] wrong thing spoke something that was
[17:07] wrong because he didn't have an
[17:09] understanding his thinking was not right
[17:12] the thought that that what he was
[17:14] thinking about was not lined up with
[17:16] god's word
[17:18] so you can see how a lie
[17:20] can sound pretty good
[17:23] a lie can sound pretty good it sounds
[17:24] pretty good to say jesus why you why you
[17:26] got to die i love you why would you want
[17:29] to die why would you want to go on the
[17:30] cross
[17:34] in matthew 16 we just read and peter
[17:36] took him and began to rebuke him saying
[17:38] be it far from me lord this shall not be
[17:40] under thee
[17:41] and that's what and
[17:43] you compare that with with eve or where
[17:45] she listened to the lie of the devil ye
[17:46] shall not surely die and and that all
[17:49] the things that the devil said to her
[17:51] sounded pretty good
[17:53] for god doth know that in the day you
[17:55] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[17:57] opened and ye shall be as gods knowing
[17:59] good and evil
[18:00] it sounded pretty good but she had lost
[18:03] sight of what her purpose was
[18:05] that god was going to use her to bring
[18:06] life
[18:09] if she'd just wait wait on things
[18:11] now see what brother brown said in the
[18:13] greatest battle ever fought he said see
[18:15] his attack
[18:16] listen close this close and his attack
[18:19] is what to disbelieve god's word
[18:22] that's his attack
[18:24] there can you see the greatest battle
[18:26] was ever fought there's only two forces
[18:30] satan and god
[18:31] and what is satan's weapon against you
[18:34] is to try to get you to disbelieve your
[18:36] weapon
[18:38] he disarms you
[18:40] let's listen real quiet now listen if he
[18:42] can get you to disbelieve your weapon is
[18:44] equivalent
[18:46] if he gets you to believe that your
[18:47] weapon is not strong enough
[18:50] he has disarmed you
[18:53] now now see he's talking about he's
[18:54] talking about christians
[18:56] christians going along going along
[18:58] through the wilderness going going
[19:00] through a place of go trying to get to
[19:02] that place of real i will say trying to
[19:04] get to adoption trying to get to a place
[19:06] where you're in the maturity of god's
[19:08] word
[19:09] if he can get you to doubt what you've
[19:11] got how are you going to get to rest
[19:13] now you see
[19:15] that devil's lie you shall not surely
[19:17] die
[19:18] see how that that comes in stages now
[19:21] you take somebody that's a young person
[19:24] that's in the church or or maybe someone
[19:26] that's new to the message and the devil
[19:27] will tell you a lie
[19:29] that you don't need to be born again
[19:31] that that uh he'll he'll tell you that
[19:33] it's not for you that god doesn't care
[19:34] about you and and pile on all these lies
[19:38] and then and then you maybe you'll start
[19:40] to thinking thinking that that's right
[19:41] that you that the world is better and
[19:43] and and and you'll believe the level
[19:45] devil's lie if you're not careful and
[19:48] and not be saved now see the devil's lie
[19:51] you're not going to die if you go away
[19:52] from god's word if you if you don't
[19:54] believe god's word you're not going to
[19:55] die but you will die
[19:58] the only the only
[20:00] you see what a gentleman god is that he
[20:02] won't force it on anybody
[20:04] he lays the word in front of you and you
[20:06] have a choice whether to exceed receive
[20:08] it or accept it to
[20:10] to you you're right right now you're
[20:11] judging whether these things be true as
[20:13] we sit in church all day long you know
[20:15] you're judging whether it's whether it's
[20:17] correct
[20:18] and then then after you're born again
[20:21] after you're born again
[20:22] then then the devil changes his tactics
[20:25] he said he'll say you you're not going
[20:26] to die now look look how brother ramone
[20:29] preached that message uh why pentecost
[20:31] failed
[20:32] all these pentecostals they got the
[20:34] baptism of the holy ghost and they they
[20:36] they began to speak in tongues and these
[20:38] kind of things and then then they began
[20:40] to think he said you failed because you
[20:42] didn't go on
[20:43] and you think well i i'm good i'm set
[20:46] but yet you got to go on because you
[20:49] need to come to adoption you there's
[20:51] more to it and to think well i'm i'm
[20:53] good i'm i'm good and and then they
[20:56] you'll just you'll keep going on and go
[20:58] down into the ground because because
[21:01] there's
[21:03] there's more to it
[21:05] you see how if we go back to that chart
[21:07] that we looked at from the very
[21:08] beginning
[21:10] can you let's just let's just ask some
[21:11] questions can you see god's purpose in
[21:13] your life
[21:15] or do you do you stumble at parts of the
[21:17] word like eve did because we're coming
[21:19] to a place where we're trying to come to
[21:20] a place of rest where we know the things
[21:23] of god are true
[21:24] do you stumble at things like like eve
[21:26] did where i'm gonna have to go out and
[21:28] listen to
[21:29] some some kind of false thing so i can
[21:31] get truth
[21:32] are you willing to let god be the lord
[21:35] of your heart
[21:36] are you willing to take correction
[21:38] are you willing to let the word have
[21:40] have preeminence in your life and
[21:41] correct things that are wrong
[21:44] brother brown said in the message
[21:46] conferences he said will not be like eve
[21:49] one have this and one have that a
[21:51] disfigured body
[21:53] it'll be word
[21:54] by word what god said
[21:57] it'll be word by word there's going to
[21:59] be a bride that will be that will be
[22:01] built up and know what god wants done
[22:03] with the word that will have a complete
[22:05] understanding of what our purpose is
[22:08] now brother ram in the message one this
[22:10] he said let me make that again do not
[22:12] believe this believe any word of god's
[22:14] bible
[22:15] but just don't say yes i believe it
[22:18] say but no there's nothing about that
[22:21] you believe it
[22:22] you'll accept it
[22:24] if you lay it aside say well my church
[22:26] don't believe it that way then you do
[22:27] not believe it's god's word and you'll
[22:29] walk away under the same condemnation
[22:31] that eve went away under
[22:33] you separated yourself from the eternal
[22:36] when you had a chance to be united with
[22:38] him
[22:38] now remember that cannot be questioned
[22:40] because it was one word that in god's
[22:43] that that in god's word
[22:45] and now if god had just a few words
[22:47] there that people must obey
[22:49] and in them few words one of them was
[22:51] misrepresented cause death caused death
[22:55] look at the words we got today
[23:01] so we need all of them
[23:03] we need daniel 70 weeks we need christ
[23:05] the mystery god revealed we need who is
[23:06] this
[23:07] kid we need a paradox we need to know
[23:10] what the message is about
[23:12] we must receive every one of them hold
[23:15] on to them and enter into them as
[23:17] promises from god
[23:19] and a true wife of god will do that true
[23:22] engaged espoused one
[23:25] now i hope these little things go down
[23:27] deep now so we can catch them
[23:29] what was the first thing that caused eve
[23:32] to disbelieve god's word
[23:34] it was because satan promised her more
[23:36] wisdom you will be wise
[23:39] now you see the human race is always
[23:41] reaching after something
[23:43] and eve was reaching after more wisdom
[23:46] now let's stop just one minute isn't
[23:49] that the condition of the world today
[23:50] they want more wisdom
[23:52] better class higher educated wanting
[23:54] something that's different more wisdom
[23:56] that's what he wanted
[23:58] but let me say this also
[24:00] that there is no wisdom can surpass gods
[24:04] yes it's in such a humble form
[24:07] that people miss it
[24:12] so what's he saying
[24:13] take god at his word we you i think one
[24:16] of the greatest deceptions
[24:19] around today is that is that we don't
[24:21] need we don't need these things but he's
[24:24] saying we've got look at the words we've
[24:25] got today
[24:27] we need everything that's in the message
[24:32] now that's why uh paul in hebrews
[24:34] chapter four exhorted us let us
[24:36] therefore fear
[24:38] let's say let's have a little fear
[24:40] let's let's come into with with
[24:41] reverence and respect
[24:43] and uh
[24:45] he said lest the promise being left of
[24:47] us enter
[24:48] left us of us entering into his rest any
[24:50] of you should seem to come short of it
[24:53] for unto us was the gospel preached
[24:56] as well as unto them
[24:58] but the word preached did not profit
[25:00] them not being mixed with faith and then
[25:03] them that heard it
[25:04] for we which have believed do enter into
[25:06] rest
[25:08] as he said as i have sworn in my wrath
[25:10] if they shall enter into my arrest
[25:12] although the works were finished from
[25:14] the foundation of the world for he spake
[25:16] in a certain place of the seventh day on
[25:18] this wise
[25:19] and god did rest
[25:21] the seventh day from all his works
[25:24] and in this place again if the musicians
[25:26] can go ahead and come and in this place
[25:28] again
[25:30] if they shall enter into my rest
[25:32] and we'll find rest
[25:34] as we dive into this a little bit more
[25:36] rest
[25:37] comes from knowing god's word
[25:40] all right
[25:42] god bless you
