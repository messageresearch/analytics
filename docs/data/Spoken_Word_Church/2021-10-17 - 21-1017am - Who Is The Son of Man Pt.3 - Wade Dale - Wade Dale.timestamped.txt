[2:05] when i went to brother richard's sunday
[2:07] i said well i'll just kind of hit on it
[2:08] and just see
[2:10] you know
[2:11] how it goes because uh
[2:13] you don't hear a lot of preaching just
[2:15] on the son of man
[2:17] um
[2:18] now they'll hit it in sermons but just
[2:20] to go ahead and preach who he is well
[2:22] after the service was over i kind of put
[2:23] part one and part two together from last
[2:26] couple sundays ago and
[2:28] one brother said you know what he said
[2:30] i've been in the message forever how
[2:31] much longer he'd been and how long he'd
[2:33] been in the message and he said i never
[2:35] understood
[2:37] the dispensational change of the son of
[2:40] god son of man and who the son of man
[2:42] was back in the back in you know 2000
[2:44] years ago and he said i really
[2:46] appreciate it
[2:47] so
[2:48] if i went for one person
[2:50] that's all we're looking for we're
[2:52] looking for the last one right we're
[2:54] looking for the last 12 we're looking
[2:55] for the last one all right or the last
[2:57] hundred we're looking for the last one
[2:59] and we want that last one to grow up in
[3:01] god we want somebody you know when
[3:03] somebody comes to you and said i never
[3:05] saw that now i see it well see that's a
[3:06] revelation
[3:08] and that'll stick with him forever that
[3:09] will actually help him put things
[3:11] together maybe that that he'd had a a a
[3:14] mystery about before because i thought
[3:16] all the mystery is supposed to be
[3:17] revealed in the in the end time and as
[3:19] we read here that we're going to read
[3:21] that the son of man is to be revealed
[3:22] not to just be not to just be here but
[3:25] to be revealed who he is what's he doing
[3:27] here and what's he
[3:30] he's taking us home so john 1 let's read
[3:35] before that let's bow our heads
[3:38] the heavenly father thank you for this
[3:39] morning that you give us
[3:41] lord that's truly a resurrection
[3:44] that we honor the resurrection of the
[3:46] empty tomb lord it may be over there in
[3:48] israel but
[3:50] lord you came out of that empty tomb and
[3:52] then you came into a heart of people
[3:54] and as brother bob was talking about
[3:56] that throne now is in our hearts it's
[3:58] not in a place sitting somewhere it's in
[3:59] our the throne room of our heart and
[4:02] lord today i
[4:03] pray that you will speak to us through
[4:05] that throne room lord not just be
[4:07] intellect or intelligence lord but let
[4:09] it be lord of revelation
[4:11] let it be the knowledge of god that
[4:13] takes over and gives us lord complete
[4:14] revelation of what's going on because we
[4:16] need it in this end time as brother bob
[4:19] was talking about the daniel 70 weeks
[4:20] putting all the pieces together lord
[4:22] because we're going to read a quote from
[4:24] your prophet
[4:25] this afternoon that's going to thrill
[4:27] the people lord and it's going to get us
[4:29] thinking lord a little bit different
[4:31] than we thought before
[4:32] father forgive us of our sins bless this
[4:34] day continue to
[4:36] bless our pastor and raise him up for
[4:38] your honor and glory lord
[4:39] it was good to see him in the pulpit
[4:41] last weekend lord
[4:42] we pray that you just bless him now and
[4:44] take care of each and every one of us in
[4:45] the furthermore service in jesus name
[4:47] amen
[4:49] john 1 1 in the beginning was the
[4:51] word
[4:52] and the word was with god and the word
[4:54] was god all right the same was in the
[4:57] beginning with god
[4:59] how many people we got ran around here
[5:01] one
[5:02] all things were made by him and without
[5:04] him was not anything made that was made
[5:07] in him was life and the life was the
[5:09] light of men and the light shineth in
[5:11] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[5:13] it not
[5:14] there was a man sent from god whose name
[5:16] was john john the baptist the same came
[5:18] for a witness to bear witness of the
[5:20] light that all men through him might
[5:21] believe
[5:22] he was not that light
[5:27] he was not that light
[5:30] he was sent to bear witness of the light
[5:33] amen doesn't that sound familiar in the
[5:34] end time
[5:36] there was another elijah prophet
[5:38] that came in the end time to introduce
[5:41] not be him not be the not be the
[5:44] the
[5:45] the son of man but be a son of man
[5:46] revealing the son of man
[5:48] that was the true light who go back to
[5:51] jesus the son of man which lightly
[5:53] lighteth every man that cometh into the
[5:54] world
[5:56] he was in the world and the world was
[5:57] made by him and the world knew him not
[5:59] so listen if the world didn't know him
[6:00] then then when we go to the have the son
[6:02] of man revelation in the end time the
[6:04] world is not going to know who he is
[6:07] all right
[6:09] that's what we're looking at this whole
[6:10] series is taking the characteristics if
[6:12] we believe that the son of man is
[6:14] supposed to come back and be revealed in
[6:15] the end time we got to know what his
[6:17] characteristics is we got to know what
[6:20] he's going to act like when he gets here
[6:22] amen or we'll miss him because they they
[6:24] thought they knew what he looked like
[6:26] back then and what he was going to act
[6:27] like
[6:28] but he came exactly the way the
[6:30] scripture said but not according to
[6:32] their denomination and that's the same
[6:34] way in the end time and we'll read that
[6:36] quote a little bit later on maybe
[6:37] tonight or this afternoon he came into
[6:39] his own and his own received him not the
[6:41] world didn't know him
[6:43] he came to his own they didn't know him
[6:47] he was alone
[6:49] but look
[6:51] but as many as received him
[6:54] to them gave he power
[6:57] to become the sons of god that's me and
[6:59] you the baptism of the holy ghost amen
[7:02] even to them that believe on his name
[7:04] which were born not of blood
[7:06] nor of the will of the flesh
[7:08] nor of the will of man in other words
[7:10] not born between a man and a woman
[7:13] but of
[7:14] god and the word
[7:17] was made flesh
[7:19] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[7:20] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[7:23] of the father full of grace
[7:25] and truth you may be seated in the lord
[7:27] at his blessing
[7:28] to the reading of the word
[7:31] we want to look again i'll read genesis
[7:33] 3 15 in a minute but look
[7:35] thing right there where's and the word
[7:38] was made flesh everybody got that
[7:42] now
[7:43] the son of man
[7:45] the son of man
[7:47] was the word
[7:49] made flesh
[7:51] he was word before he was flesh
[7:54] now the difference in me and you is
[7:57] being a son of man our sons and
[7:59] daughters of god
[8:00] we come different from that
[8:03] we came flesh fallen nature first
[8:07] and then the word found us or called our
[8:09] name and then we became the word made
[8:11] flesh when we received the new birth
[8:14] jesus christ didn't need a new birth he
[8:16] was the birth
[8:17] amen so he came with the word inside of
[8:20] him we did not
[8:22] we came lost contrary
[8:25] we were contrary to the word how in the
[8:27] world you going to say would come here
[8:28] with something if it were contrary to it
[8:31] amen
[8:32] we have representation
[8:34] you got to see that and the
[8:36] representation is in the word and the
[8:37] word is the seed
[8:40] the only seed that god has
[8:43] is the word
[8:44] he has no natural seed
[8:46] he doesn't need a natural seed he says
[8:48] let there be
[8:50] amen
[8:52] so now look
[8:55] we come to a time though
[8:58] and we'll look at it in just a second
[8:59] when we get into genesis 126 man but
[9:01] think about this i was speaking on this
[9:03] in
[9:04] in kentucky and it kind of the thought
[9:06] came to me as much as i read genesis 1
[9:07] 26 donny something came unfolded sunday
[9:11] because what there was adam
[9:14] you know eve was supposed to do exactly
[9:17] what mary did
[9:23] eve's commission was be it unto me
[9:25] according to thy word
[9:27] adam spoke it he produced it
[9:30] right
[9:32] so what happened in the second adam or
[9:35] or christ what happened
[9:37] here comes the angel
[9:39] and says the holy ghost is going to
[9:41] overshadow you and the holy ghost is a
[9:42] man we know that that's the man christ
[9:44] jesus him to god himself
[9:47] and what'd she say
[9:48] be unto me according to that word she
[9:50] had to say that
[9:53] and then it was placed in a womb and
[9:54] what did she do she produced
[9:57] the child
[9:59] and that's exactly brother brown said
[10:00] that eve was supposed to bring the body
[10:02] of jesus and that's what he was supposed
[10:03] to do just step into it
[10:05] and then we're all supposed to leave
[10:06] eternal then whatever whatever adam
[10:08] would speak eve would produce it and
[10:10] we'd be there that would be the sons and
[10:12] daughters of god right
[10:14] you say oh how's that going to be in the
[10:16] end time well listen brother brown said
[10:19] god's going to prove that this eve won't
[10:21] fall now who's the even this hour that's
[10:23] the bride of jesus christ
[10:25] and how did you come into the body you
[10:27] had a bride
[10:28] person
[10:30] life comes through the body
[10:32] someone had to talk to you a preacher
[10:34] had to preach to you and he had to
[10:36] preach the holy ghost to you and listen
[10:40] you might get born again if the preacher
[10:41] don't have the holy ghost but he really
[10:43] needs the holy ghost for you to get it
[10:44] because seed life comes through the body
[10:46] amen so that's where the seed the word
[10:49] comes from that's why many many many
[10:52] preachers if you you got to be careful
[10:53] brother brown said money women in
[10:55] popularity
[10:57] those are three things that will mess
[10:58] you up more than anything why because
[11:00] you are planting a seed
[11:03] into a woman
[11:05] the bride
[11:06] but it's spiritual if you keep it
[11:08] separate you're okay but if you live
[11:10] real close to that
[11:12] be careful
[11:13] many women in popularity that's what
[11:15] brother brown said the three things you
[11:16] need to watch out for because there's an
[11:18] anointing there
[11:20] listen eve had an anointing she was
[11:21] anointed to do a job
[11:23] she just took that anointing and
[11:25] listened to who listen to the beast or
[11:27] listen to satan before she listens to
[11:29] her husband is that what the prophet of
[11:30] god said she came out from behind adam
[11:33] amen and that's what happens to me and
[11:35] you we come out from behind adam and we
[11:38] get in big trouble
[11:39] amen stay with this second adam
[11:42] stay with this son of man
[11:45] because what was the first adam he was
[11:46] the son of god
[11:47] he wasn't the son of man listen if he
[11:49] would have been the son of man he could
[11:51] have saved eve
[11:54] he could have saved eve he would have
[11:55] been a savior if he would have been the
[11:57] one the word was made flesh if he would
[11:59] have been the son of man he could have
[12:01] saved eve but he wasn't he was the son
[12:04] of god
[12:05] he was created in genesis 1 26 man was
[12:08] put into the 2 7 man
[12:10] wasn't a savior
[12:13] though he could have complete control he
[12:15] wasn't a savior he wasn't a healer
[12:17] he had not did not have those attributes
[12:20] the only attribute he had was is to
[12:21] control the world
[12:23] okay
[12:24] but now see by the power of you and of
[12:26] you and me receiving the new birth
[12:29] see he didn't receive a new birth
[12:31] the first adam
[12:33] the second adam didn't receive a new
[12:34] birth he was the new birth but all the
[12:36] sons and daughters that born after that
[12:39] had to receive a new birth
[12:41] which gave us
[12:43] power
[12:44] as the son of man because genesis 8 i
[12:46] mean romans 8 says what we're heirs and
[12:48] joint heirs with jesus christ okay
[12:51] so this is where we're going to and i'll
[12:52] read you a quote this afternoon
[12:55] and i'll just kind of quote it but i'll
[12:56] read it and it's in there
[12:59] where brother branham says
[13:01] this son of man revelation
[13:04] will come in a different way
[13:09] the son of man revelation will come in a
[13:11] different way that's why you have to
[13:13] separate it that's why you have to keep
[13:15] it separate
[13:16] you sure it's the same person yes it's
[13:18] the same person but look the same person
[13:21] went into martin luther and he sat in a
[13:24] pub drank a beer and smoked a pipe and
[13:26] talked about god and got people born
[13:28] again under justification same holy
[13:30] ghost but me and you can't do that
[13:33] why god has moved on
[13:35] god has moved on to a higher revelation
[13:37] and we'll read that they got partial
[13:39] revelation in the church ages that's why
[13:42] this is important who is this son of man
[13:44] that's why jesus asked that question who
[13:47] do men say that i the son of man i am
[13:49] and they told him the revelation of the
[13:51] son of god so he said okay i'll build my
[13:52] church on that we'll talk about in a
[13:54] minute
[13:55] so let's go to genesis 3 15
[13:58] because we know what happened remember
[14:00] the fall happened all right and it
[14:02] messed everything up it messed us up it
[14:04] didn't mess god up and messed us up it
[14:06] made it to where his attribute could be
[14:08] displayed he could be a savior he could
[14:10] be a healer he could be a redeemer and
[14:12] all these different things
[14:14] and then god after the fall says what i
[14:17] will put enmity i will
[14:20] not adam anymore i will put enmity
[14:24] between thee and the woman and between
[14:26] thy seed and her seed now that's natural
[14:28] seed because look natural seed had been
[14:30] planted
[14:32] everybody got that
[14:34] when he spoke this natural seed had come
[14:37] into into view
[14:39] eve was already right here pregnant
[14:44] with adam and the beast
[14:47] right
[14:48] so now i will put enmity between then
[14:51] the woman in between thy seed
[14:53] serpent seed
[14:55] and her seed
[14:56] natural seed because she's going to
[14:58] receive a natural seed she didn't
[15:00] she didn't receive
[15:02] the seeds she was supposed to receive
[15:04] when you come down here to mary she
[15:06] received the seeds you're supposed to
[15:08] receive
[15:10] without the instrumentality of a man it
[15:11] was the holy ghost amen that
[15:13] overshadowed her
[15:15] and in her will be
[15:18] jesus christ
[15:19] the son of man
[15:22] amen you're all right
[15:24] genesis 3 15 i will put enmity i'm
[15:27] in other words i'm going to do it there
[15:29] will be no more covenants you will i
[15:31] will or you don't you do
[15:34] i'm just going to do it
[15:35] abraham i'm going to save you abraham
[15:37] i'm going to put you in the land i will
[15:40] i will i will look in genesis about 14
[15:42] 15 16. i will i will
[15:45] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[15:46] shalt bruise his heel all right let's go
[15:48] now
[15:51] so that's genesis 3 15. that is
[15:53] something coming
[15:55] through a woman to flesh
[15:59] and god's going to use that that's a
[16:01] promise
[16:02] of the son of man
[16:05] a woman is going to receive a seed
[16:07] with no instrumentality of man she's
[16:09] going to say revelation be it unto me
[16:11] according to thy word
[16:13] or let's take an updated revelation
[16:16] brother branham that ain't nothing but
[16:18] the truth
[16:20] that's a little heady right same thing
[16:22] god came down and said okay whatever you
[16:24] want
[16:25] mary was told she's gonna have a child
[16:27] how can i have a child knowing no man
[16:30] but when the when the lord when the lord
[16:32] or when gabriel explained it to her she
[16:34] said okay be it unto me according to my
[16:36] word or
[16:38] gabriel that ain't nothing but the truth
[16:40] amen so we see that now in the end time
[16:43] and that's what you and i are going to
[16:44] have to work with we work in that same
[16:46] realm lord be it unto me according to
[16:49] that word lord let it be me
[16:52] i'll do it
[16:54] that ain't nothing but the truth
[16:57] preacher that ain't nothing but the
[16:58] truth
[16:59] try that sometimes
[17:04] but it comes to a woman but it but
[17:06] remember
[17:07] the word was made flesh
[17:09] the word was spoke back into in eternity
[17:12] right john 1 1 was not written 2 000
[17:14] years ago it was all written for the
[17:15] foundation of the world so that word was
[17:17] made flesh through a woman
[17:21] because through a woman came to fall
[17:24] ma'am
[17:25] okay but not by sex
[17:28] by spoken word
[17:30] because the spoken word is the original
[17:31] seed
[17:32] all right deuteronomy 18 15
[17:35] proving again that god's going to come
[17:37] in flesh
[17:39] all right god's going to come in flesh
[17:40] the lord thy god will raise up unto thee
[17:42] a prophet from the midst of thee now
[17:45] listen what is the son of man
[17:49] you say okay that's jesus in it no
[17:51] what does son of man mean
[17:54] prophet
[17:56] just remember son of man means prophet
[17:59] prophesy
[18:01] son of man we'll read it in ezekiel this
[18:03] afternoon ezekiel son of man prophesy
[18:06] tell israel
[18:07] why well that's
[18:09] that's kind of what jesus did didn't he
[18:12] he came down here and he prophesied
[18:14] he told us all the things that was going
[18:15] to happen and people people were going
[18:17] to kill him and then he was going to
[18:19] come back in three days and all these
[18:21] things and he was
[18:22] not a prophet he was the prophet
[18:25] moses was a prophet the lord jesus was
[18:28] the prophet
[18:29] so he was the son of man because he was
[18:32] born not of a man
[18:33] all right
[18:35] the lord thy god will raise up unto thee
[18:36] a prophet from the midst of thee
[18:38] of thy brethren look like unto me so now
[18:41] what was moses moses was flesh
[18:44] moses was a flesh man
[18:47] a prophet
[18:48] so that's what he's prophesying
[18:51] that there's going to come one just like
[18:53] him a prophet that's capital p in the
[18:56] bible if you see the prophet there
[18:59] like unto me unto him
[19:02] you shall hearken so there's another
[19:04] flesh man so now we're going to jump
[19:07] several thousand years to matthew 16
[19:09] verse 13 and that flesh man is standing
[19:12] on earth he's been on earth for about 30
[19:14] odd years at this moment
[19:16] and jesus came into the coast accessory
[19:18] of philippines asked the disciples whom
[19:19] do men say that i the son of man am
[19:22] and they said some say they were john
[19:24] the baptist
[19:25] some elijah jeremiah or one of the
[19:28] prophets
[19:29] and he said unto them but whom do you
[19:30] say i am simon peter answered said thou
[19:32] art the christ
[19:33] the son of the living god
[19:36] the son of the living god not son of man
[19:39] and jesus answered and said unto him
[19:41] listen if they would have known who that
[19:42] man was they would have been there
[19:43] during the whole time remember they
[19:45] scattered the night of the crucifixion
[19:46] that over the day of the crucifixion
[19:48] they wanted nobody around him peter
[19:50] denied him three times they were scared
[19:51] to death
[19:53] to not even be
[19:55] to not even be associated with jesus
[19:57] they've been with him for three and a
[19:58] half years and all of a sudden they're
[19:59] like we don't know that guy
[20:02] we're gonna hide in the bushes and see
[20:03] what's going on
[20:05] jesus answered and said on him blessed
[20:06] are thou simon bar jonah for flesh and
[20:08] blood
[20:09] hath not revealed it unto thee but my
[20:12] father which is in heaven
[20:14] so it's not a it's not a carnal
[20:16] revelation
[20:17] it's a spiritual revelation right that's
[20:20] why everybody says he built his church
[20:22] onto different things well brother brown
[20:23] said he built it on a spiritual
[20:24] revelation and we'll read that quote
[20:26] here in just a minute
[20:28] and i say unto thee
[20:30] thou art peter and upon this rock i will
[20:32] build my church this revelation i will
[20:35] build my church and the gates of hell
[20:36] shall not prevail against it and i will
[20:38] give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
[20:39] of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind
[20:40] on earth shall be bound in heaven
[20:42] whatsoever you shall loose on earth
[20:43] shall be loosed in heaven so peter had a
[20:45] little power given to him because he was
[20:47] going to be the spokesman on the day of
[20:49] pentecost but let's read this quote
[20:51] from thirst 1965.
[20:56] to know him as life
[20:59] the person
[21:00] christ himself not comparing it's a
[21:03] revelation that god built his church
[21:05] upon
[21:06] all right and if we don't build upon
[21:08] that same church the bible says abel by
[21:11] faith
[21:12] and faith is a divine revelation it's
[21:15] not just an aha moment it's something
[21:16] that sticks with you something that's
[21:18] part of you and it'll still be a part of
[21:20] you listen you can't get a revelation
[21:23] and then lose it
[21:25] not a true one from god you can't get a
[21:27] true revelation from god and it become a
[21:29] part of you and it sparked something in
[21:30] your heart
[21:31] you know you might well you know what
[21:33] you might humanly forget
[21:36] about the revelation because you're
[21:37] human beings but you know what it's
[21:39] always there and if somebody says
[21:40] something it pops right back up amen i
[21:43] know it's happened to you it's happened
[21:44] to me
[21:45] but now if we get some thoughts in our
[21:47] mind
[21:48] and they don't ever come back that was
[21:50] your thought
[21:51] amen
[21:52] best that it don't come back
[21:54] best that you bury it in the sea of
[21:56] forgetfulness never to be remembered
[21:58] again i've had a few of them haven't you
[22:00] bro john
[22:01] yeah uh-huh some of them i don't want
[22:03] them no more i don't even want to write
[22:04] them down because i want to remember
[22:05] them no more
[22:07] the revelations i thought i had all of
[22:09] us all of y'all that went through the
[22:10] denominations and swore on this and
[22:12] swore on that and swore on
[22:15] father son holy ghost and swore on the
[22:16] baptism and swore on it yeah
[22:18] that wasn't your revelation not from god
[22:21] it wasn't
[22:22] and if we don't build upon that same
[22:24] church the bible said abel by faith and
[22:26] faith is a divine revelation see faith
[22:30] is a divine revelation look this whole
[22:32] thing is built upon the revelation then
[22:35] and unless
[22:36] this is revealed to you jesus said i
[22:39] thank thee father thou has hid these
[22:40] things from the wise and prudent and
[22:42] revealed to the babe such as we'll learn
[22:43] now see now the whole thing look is
[22:45] built
[22:46] there you've got to know the person
[22:50] not an idea
[22:51] not something wrote down on a piece of
[22:52] paper but a divine revelation of the
[22:55] person now who is that person
[22:57] the
[22:58] son of man
[23:00] you got to know that jesus christ in
[23:02] flesh died for you
[23:04] and that he released that son of god and
[23:07] it came inside of you called the holy
[23:08] ghost everybody got that
[23:10] okay
[23:12] that's the way you got to see it it's
[23:13] like bob said this today
[23:15] if you don't go through justification
[23:17] saying catching baptism holy ghost
[23:19] i don't see how you can get the holy
[23:20] ghost
[23:25] i don't
[23:26] because it's required
[23:28] amen
[23:30] all right let's look at the next one
[23:31] what is the vision 1956. this was in
[23:34] spindale north carolina that's the paper
[23:36] brother joe
[23:37] joe green lives
[23:39] he was probably miss henry was probably
[23:42] brother henry green when his daddy was
[23:44] probably sitting in this meeting in 1956
[23:46] i guarantee you was
[23:48] you see the bible said the prophet said
[23:50] there'll be a day that will not be
[23:51] neither light nor dark
[23:53] but in the evening it shall be light
[23:56] now i want you to watch this now
[23:57] remember this afternoon
[24:00] we're going to talk about
[24:01] a different way the son of man is going
[24:03] to be revealed in a different way
[24:07] all right listen
[24:08] now watch this though
[24:10] now when the holy spirit first fell on
[24:12] the church
[24:15] pentecost
[24:16] 2000 years ago upper room acts 2 38
[24:21] it was in the eastern people in
[24:23] jerusalem that's where the holy ghost
[24:25] fell and great signs and wonders were
[24:26] done by the church in the early
[24:28] pentecostal age of the early church
[24:30] then the next round of apostles then
[24:33] come in the catholic church then 1500
[24:36] years then the lutheran
[24:38] and then from then on down it's been a
[24:40] day now roll it on up a little bit
[24:41] please so everybody see
[24:43] and then from then and then from then on
[24:46] down it's been a day where the light
[24:48] went out
[24:51] and it's been a daylight enough
[24:55] that you could see that jesus was the
[24:58] son of god
[25:00] not son of man
[25:02] jesus was the son of god
[25:04] you should repent
[25:06] acts 2 38 repent and be baptized in the
[25:08] name of jesus christ with your mission
[25:09] in remission of your sins and you shall
[25:11] receive the gift of the holy ghost what
[25:12] is the holy ghost son of god
[25:15] all right you should repent but the real
[25:18] bright light of the holy ghost has never
[25:21] shined through these ages
[25:23] now see if you don't if you don't
[25:24] balance that right
[25:26] it'll be like the group that says well
[25:28] you nobody got had the holy ghost until
[25:30] the end time well that's not true
[25:33] that's not true
[25:36] they all had the same holy ghost
[25:38] it was promised
[25:39] in in paul's age all the way up to to
[25:42] now
[25:43] but they only got a portion of it
[25:46] almost went out he said but the real
[25:48] bright light of the holy ghost has never
[25:50] shined through these ages certainly the
[25:52] bible said it wouldn't why because these
[25:55] prophets says what in the evening time
[25:57] it shall be light
[25:59] gross darkness will be upon the earth
[26:01] and all these different prophecies in
[26:03] the old testament
[26:05] just don't ever do away with the old
[26:06] testament
[26:08] as the prophet said it wouldn't just as
[26:11] sure as he said they couldn't believe
[26:13] because isaiah said there hasn't been
[26:16] light because the prophet said
[26:18] there look
[26:19] scroll that all the way up let me
[26:21] let's read that
[26:26] look there's been enough light to know
[26:28] that you ought to do right and wrong
[26:33] that's the holy ghost that's your
[26:34] spiritual rudder amen
[26:37] there's been enough light to know that
[26:40] you believed on the resurrection of the
[26:42] lord jesus accept him as personal savior
[26:45] put your name on the church book and
[26:47] live the good life
[26:51] but as far as signs and wonders in the
[26:53] direct rays of the sun shining it hasn't
[26:55] been since pentecost
[27:00] in the revealing of who
[27:02] the son of man
[27:05] that's the son of god revelation right
[27:06] there
[27:10] when jesus stood and said peter this is
[27:12] what i'll build my church on
[27:15] and the gates of hell will not prevail
[27:17] against it
[27:18] that's what he built his church on
[27:19] believe on the resurrection believe the
[27:21] lord jesus came up enough life to know
[27:23] that you believed on the resurrection
[27:25] you ought to do right and wrong and all
[27:26] these other things up there that's the
[27:28] son of god revelation through the church
[27:30] ages got him in the body
[27:33] gave them a little bit of maybe some of
[27:35] these virtues but not a lot
[27:38] brother branham you remember in the um
[27:41] what was it in the dark ages
[27:43] he said for them just to say they were
[27:45] christians
[27:47] they got killed
[27:49] he said just enough of the holy ghost to
[27:51] get them in the body because what
[27:52] happened was a lot of the soldiers
[27:54] received the holy ghost too i believe
[27:57] when they saw them when they saw the
[27:59] believers walking into that lion's den
[28:01] and just praising god and worshipping
[28:02] the lord and those soldiers threw down
[28:05] well they might not have known nothing
[28:07] but they believed in what those people
[28:09] believed in
[28:10] believe on the lord jesus christ and
[28:12] thou shalt be saved that is a revelation
[28:16] for god so loved the world that he sent
[28:17] his only begotten son that whosoever
[28:19] shall believe in him what shall not
[28:21] perish but have everlasting life
[28:23] there's your son of god revelation
[28:25] that's to there's enough light to know
[28:27] that you ought to do right and wrong i
[28:28] kind of like that that that kind of sets
[28:30] the stage
[28:33] but remember
[28:35] it's the same holy ghost
[28:38] it's just the difference of the word
[28:40] not the different word
[28:42] i was thinking uh brother samson sheddie
[28:45] sent me a message this morning
[28:49] they are just now translating the church
[28:50] age book
[28:52] in one of their languages in in india
[28:54] just now
[28:56] what we've had for 40 years or longer 50
[28:59] years
[29:01] what we cherish and read and listen i've
[29:03] got about five copies of them
[29:06] i like my church age book
[29:08] they're just now getting them
[29:11] now whose fault is that i stepped back
[29:12] there and i said it's our fault
[29:15] it's our fault they didn't get those i
[29:17] mean translations have been forever
[29:20] and they're just now getting translation
[29:22] of
[29:23] of the church age book i just it's
[29:25] unbelievable
[29:26] but brother brown said he said you'll
[29:28] get we'll give an account
[29:30] if we don't get this message out to the
[29:32] people
[29:32] you and i will give an account because
[29:34] we didn't go get the message out to the
[29:36] community and instead of going across
[29:38] the world all right so there's been
[29:39] enough light so let's go to this
[29:42] question son of god is who
[29:44] put it up please
[29:48] because i asked them the same question
[29:49] like brother dale asked
[29:51] years and years ago it's when you say
[29:53] son of god i asked him in
[29:55] in kentucky i said when you say son of
[29:57] god who do you who you know you let you
[30:00] put that title out
[30:02] because jesus said who is this son of
[30:04] man
[30:05] uh who do you say are the son of man i
[30:08] am so he put the title out
[30:10] but he also there was many that said son
[30:12] of god
[30:14] you think well
[30:16] that was jesus
[30:18] no
[30:20] that wasn't jesus first
[30:25] the son of god was the creator
[30:28] the one that stood before the foundation
[30:30] of the world that went out of god as i
[30:32] was trying to you really you have to get
[30:34] a revelation to understand that how god
[30:37] can move himself over
[30:40] and still be this person here
[30:43] not do away with this one right here
[30:45] amen not do away with the almighty the
[30:48] the great one that covers all space time
[30:51] and eternity
[30:53] but listen as i was telling them in
[30:55] kentucky god didn't write the bible so
[30:58] he could explain to himself who he was
[31:03] he wrote the bible to explain himself to
[31:06] me and you
[31:08] and he had to write it
[31:10] so that somebody would catch it
[31:12] or he'd be an awful father
[31:15] he'd be an awful person to write
[31:16] something so mysterious that nobody can
[31:18] get it
[31:21] he had to write it to where it we could
[31:23] understand what it was
[31:26] so first was god jehovah and out of him
[31:30] let's just picture now a little drama
[31:33] i was i think i may have this quote
[31:35] again remember where brother brown said
[31:37] the first creation was god himself
[31:40] now boy you're talking about some
[31:41] furrows in the brain of those
[31:42] theologians
[31:43] they were probably going
[31:48] god created himself
[31:51] well i'm telling you that's what the
[31:52] prophet said
[31:53] the first creation was god himself what
[31:55] do you say
[31:56] we got to go back to creation
[31:59] listen a car has always been in this
[32:01] earth
[32:03] a computer these benches everything you
[32:06] see
[32:07] is minerals in this earth and was here
[32:09] at the flood
[32:13] car was here the whole time
[32:15] it just took the intelligence of a man
[32:18] to form or create
[32:21] put the pieces together that's what
[32:23] god's doing
[32:24] he's putting the pieces together because
[32:26] you know what
[32:27] go back and
[32:29] even go back in well go way back before
[32:31] the wheel
[32:32] go back in and say car and they go what
[32:36] like naaman chariots jocelyn in the
[32:38] streets he saw cars
[32:39] but he didn't know what to call him in
[32:41] other words he hadn't developed
[32:43] but there was a car
[32:45] in his in his uh mind
[32:48] he was seeing a vision of a car
[32:51] chariots jostling in the streets bumping
[32:53] into each other that's me and you going
[32:54] down the interstate right but he didn't
[32:56] know what to say or how to say it so
[32:59] listen it's kind of like me and you we
[33:01] don't know how to understand god how can
[33:02] you understand something that's eternal
[33:06] tell me how
[33:08] okay go back 10 billion b
[33:11] billion years
[33:12] you ain't even got started that's right
[33:14] right
[33:16] go 10 billion maybe million years that
[33:17] way
[33:19] you ain't now win
[33:21] so how are me and you and our finite
[33:24] we have a beginning and an end
[33:26] here on earth
[33:28] how are we going to understand this guy
[33:30] he's going to condescend or lower
[33:32] himself
[33:34] and bring you a revelation
[33:36] and then that's the first creation was
[33:39] god himself
[33:41] because i can't understand how a man can
[33:43] just be hanging out in the middle of in
[33:45] the middle of nothing
[33:49] that's what he was doing he was standing
[33:51] somewhere
[33:53] and he said let there be
[33:55] and boom
[33:57] i was thinking yesterday
[34:00] i was watching a video about
[34:03] trees they were
[34:05] like to amazon it's got oh
[34:08] billions of trees you don't know how
[34:09] many trees is in this world
[34:13] i'm talking about in the world
[34:15] god made every one of them
[34:17] god put the seed in the ground to make
[34:20] every one of them
[34:23] and he didn't bother him one bit
[34:25] he didn't have to get a calculator out
[34:27] so how you gonna understand that man
[34:30] you can't
[34:31] you can't understand how he was standing
[34:33] out in nothing a halo of light a little
[34:36] drama
[34:37] let's come let's see coming out of space
[34:40] where there's nothing let's make it a
[34:42] little white light like a mystic light
[34:44] now remember god never was a light
[34:47] he was a human or we would have been
[34:48] born a light
[34:50] all right
[34:50] i'm going to read genesis 1 26 we were
[34:53] born in the image of god made in his
[34:54] image okay
[34:56] so we were made in the image of a man
[34:58] but as i've always said if you and me
[35:01] would have been standing if we would
[35:02] have had moses as a buddy
[35:05] and we had the baptism of the holy ghost
[35:07] take me and and put me back in moses
[35:09] walking up through there and he's
[35:10] walking he's looking he sees a a bush
[35:12] that's burning
[35:14] and it's not being consumed
[35:17] and he hears a voice come out of the
[35:18] bush
[35:20] now see i'd know who it was
[35:22] you'd know who it was you know that was
[35:24] jesus christ standing in that in
[35:26] revelation moses revelation was god's up
[35:29] here
[35:31] god's a spirit great jehovah god
[35:34] i've heard him before
[35:35] maybe in his life
[35:37] but now i see him in this bush well see
[35:39] mine your revelation i believe i could
[35:40] see jesus standing there
[35:42] as a person because i've got the person
[35:45] inside of me well see that's the same
[35:46] way with god he's trying to reveal
[35:48] himself and look this is the only way he
[35:50] can reveal himself that you and me can
[35:52] understand it
[35:53] okay
[35:55] so let's see coming out of space where
[35:57] there's nothing make a little white
[35:58] light like a halo that was the logos
[36:00] that went out of god in the beginning
[36:02] that was the son of god the creator
[36:06] that came out of the bosom of the father
[36:09] that was what was in the beginning was
[36:11] the word
[36:12] the word was with god and the word was
[36:14] god and then the word was made flesh and
[36:16] dwelt among us and the beginning was god
[36:18] and then out of god came to logos a part
[36:21] of god that went out of god in other
[36:22] words god stepped over so that you can
[36:24] understand a little bit more right here
[36:26] then he stepped over a little bit more
[36:27] so you can understand him a little more
[36:28] right here he condescended down and all
[36:30] of a sudden for us to really be able to
[36:33] understand god
[36:35] he was born like me and you
[36:38] a baby i mean not not through sex you
[36:40] understand what i mean virgin born but
[36:42] still that baby had to come out
[36:44] a baby had to be born and that baby had
[36:45] to grow up that baby had to suffer
[36:49] he learned by the things he suffered all
[36:51] right and being made perfect
[36:54] he became the author of salvation
[36:57] all right so that part of god that went
[36:59] out of god now let's read genesis 1 26
[37:03] so god said let us make man in our own
[37:04] image
[37:06] after our likeness and let them have
[37:08] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[37:09] the fowl of the air and over every
[37:10] cattle
[37:11] and all the earth and every creeping
[37:12] thing that was upon the earth so god
[37:14] created man in his own image and the
[37:15] image god created in him male and female
[37:17] created him so he had a male and female
[37:22] he put him he put
[37:23] both in genesis 2 7
[37:26] then he separated genesis 2 he separated
[37:28] genesis 1 26 over in another form called
[37:31] eve
[37:32] everybody with me
[37:35] when adam was first formed
[37:37] he was male and female eve was literally
[37:40] a part of adam
[37:46] and then what
[37:48] god took the rib he didn't have to take
[37:50] a rib but he took a rib he took a piece
[37:52] of adam
[37:54] and formed another body
[37:56] and then he separated that spirit
[37:59] that was both male and female
[38:02] and put this one brother brown said the
[38:05] feminist spirit went into eve and then
[38:07] he kept the masculine spirit that's why
[38:08] god said
[38:10] let us make man
[38:13] the image of god created to him male and
[38:15] female created he them
[38:17] so then he put them in flesh human flesh
[38:21] and he knew they were going to fall but
[38:22] he had to put him in human flesh
[38:25] he had to because he's a creator he did
[38:28] all that creating coming up
[38:30] pollywog frog
[38:32] cow
[38:33] horse
[38:34] monkey
[38:36] beast
[38:38] don't forget him
[38:40] god created him
[38:42] in creative evolution and then
[38:44] man amen they'll be okay with that
[38:48] that's what brother brown said he said
[38:50] we're just animal flesh now we can't
[38:51] procreate with the animal but we are
[38:53] animal flesh
[38:55] we're the flesh of animal all right
[38:56] we're just a higher form of an animal
[38:58] because we have a soul that's that
[39:00] genesis 1 26 man comes into adam and
[39:03] makes him a living soul
[39:05] all right
[39:06] so now
[39:08] let's fast forward through this genesis
[39:10] 3 15 that's when he talks about putting
[39:12] enmity we already read that genesis 3 22
[39:14] he had to drive them out of the garden
[39:16] of eden
[39:18] he had to separate from them because he
[39:20] couldn't talk to him anymore the way
[39:22] they were
[39:23] the sinful condition they were in he
[39:25] couldn't talk to him anymore all right
[39:27] so he drove them out
[39:29] and he placed the east of the garden of
[39:30] eden cherubims and a flaming sword
[39:33] which turned everywhere but now look
[39:34] what is a sword
[39:36] a sword is the word
[39:38] he put a word there to keep him get back
[39:40] in it i don't think it would be you know
[39:46] no adam i got you nope you can't do that
[39:50] no it was a word he told him he said you
[39:52] can't get back in
[39:54] you can't get back in there you're done
[39:56] you're out you're out
[39:58] to keep the way of the tree of life
[40:00] because what's going to happen now
[40:01] brother brown said now that same sword
[40:03] or those same angels run you to the tree
[40:06] of life well what's running you to the
[40:08] tree of life an angel now the word
[40:12] the word's what's driving us back to our
[40:13] homeland the word is what's driving us
[40:16] to do the things that we do if you're
[40:17] christian amen
[40:20] and eve should have said like i said
[40:22] before being unto me according to thy
[40:23] word before that
[40:26] but it didn't happen she took the lie of
[40:28] the devil
[40:29] so now genesis 6 verse 5
[40:31] i got to catch up here a little bit read
[40:33] some of this from last time
[40:38] saw the wickedness of man now this is
[40:39] before the flood it repented that he
[40:42] made them
[40:43] the lord said i'm going to destroy man
[40:45] that i've created from the face of the
[40:46] earth both male both man and beast
[40:50] and everything
[40:51] but remember noah found grace
[40:54] in the eyes of the lord amen
[40:57] he would destroy this earth if he didn't
[40:59] find grace in the earth today and call
[41:00] the bride of jesus christ
[41:02] because that's the only thing that's
[41:03] holding up this wrath amen
[41:07] is me and you
[41:08] okay
[41:10] so now let's go to luke 17 26 because it
[41:12] says as it was in the days of noah
[41:15] so shall it be also in the days of the
[41:17] son of man now remember we were talking
[41:19] about that it says days of the son of
[41:21] man all right now watch they did eat
[41:23] drink married wives given in marriage
[41:25] until the day noah entered in the ark
[41:27] and then the flood came
[41:30] and destroyed them all
[41:32] all right now let's fast forward after
[41:34] the flood
[41:35] to genesis 18 1
[41:38] and the lord appeared to who abraham
[41:42] the lord appeared to abraham in the
[41:44] plains of mamrie and he sat in the tent
[41:46] uh abraham this is abraham not abram he
[41:48] didn't meet him as abram but this is
[41:50] abraham and he lifted up his eyes and
[41:52] looked and three men stood by him and
[41:54] when he saw them he ran to meet them
[41:56] from the tent door and bound himself to
[41:58] the ground and said my lord
[42:00] all right he had met this guy before so
[42:02] he knew who it was he said my lord and
[42:04] we know the meaning of that is adonai
[42:06] and which means of men or it's a spoken
[42:09] word spoken in place of yahweh in jewish
[42:12] display of reverence so he knew who he
[42:14] was
[42:15] brother brown said he knew that was
[42:17] elohim
[42:18] he knew that he and look
[42:21] he didn't even acknowledge the two that
[42:23] was beside him that's why i'm telling
[42:24] you there's going to be a separation
[42:26] time to where abraham focused on that
[42:28] one man
[42:31] the the son of man right
[42:34] he was focusing on him the other two we
[42:36] know that they went on to sodom but
[42:38] abraham never even acknowledged who they
[42:40] were
[42:42] because they were not to him
[42:45] they were to a different generation or
[42:47] they were to a different set of people
[42:53] and as they went to the world as
[42:56] billy graham and oral roberts
[42:59] and i know the bible says and brother
[43:01] branham says many times that they went
[43:02] down to blind
[43:04] the eyes of the sodomites or or blind
[43:06] the eyes of the world but listen there
[43:08] was people saved during that time
[43:11] because lot came out and his two
[43:12] daughters came out
[43:14] so they was people saved they didn't
[43:16] just go in there and blind them and
[43:17] smile and blind and they all went to
[43:19] hell
[43:20] no i believe under their ministry there
[43:22] was people that were saved
[43:24] they knew right from wrong they knew
[43:26] jesus christ died on the cross and he
[43:28] resurrected and came back into their
[43:30] heart son of god revelation
[43:33] amen because what stayed with
[43:35] abraham though
[43:36] the son of man stayed with abraham
[43:39] the two witnesses separated
[43:43] and took a message different from this
[43:45] message
[43:46] because this message was to save a group
[43:48] of people out of a city
[43:50] a sodom condition
[43:52] this one
[43:54] this one
[43:56] stayed for a body change
[44:00] this one stayed
[44:02] these two left
[44:03] there was no body change with these two
[44:07] it was destruction
[44:09] the whole world was destroyed or those
[44:11] two cities were destroyed and abraham
[44:13] stayed back or
[44:14] um
[44:17] melchizedek which would be you know
[44:19] jesus christ
[44:20] the theophany
[44:22] everybody got that
[44:24] he stayed back
[44:27] and he said abraham i'm going to visit
[44:28] you in a time of life i'm going to give
[44:30] you this you're going to have a child by
[44:31] sarah he told him everything he needed
[44:34] amen
[44:37] then i was listening the other day i
[44:38] don't it was one of the it was right
[44:40] after he preached marriage and divorce
[44:43] who is this melchizedek brother adam was
[44:45] standing and he had to divide the
[44:47] um
[44:48] he was preaching this way to the
[44:50] auditorium but
[44:51] he must have been standing in the middle
[44:53] of the basketball court with the
[44:55] the basketball goals on each end and
[44:58] they split it with a curtain and they
[44:59] split it where people would set all the
[45:01] way up here he said because there's
[45:02] audience on my left an audience to
[45:04] mariah
[45:05] well remember at the end of the service
[45:07] he turns his back
[45:10] and he said and
[45:12] in other words he's speaking
[45:14] he said
[45:16] and the lord told sarah the secrets of
[45:18] her heart in the tent behind her
[45:20] and he told the guy to stand up he said
[45:22] i can see a guy he said you stand up
[45:24] something about his daughter was sick
[45:25] well what he was doing he was showing
[45:27] the sign of the son of man
[45:29] he was showing us the same thing that
[45:32] you know that
[45:33] but see you got to keep it separate
[45:35] that wasn't jesus christ standing there
[45:39] william branham
[45:41] it was jesus christ using william
[45:44] branham using that trumpet
[45:47] to let us know
[45:48] because remember
[45:50] if the son of man's prophet
[45:53] prophetic
[45:55] then it's the word
[45:58] what's the old testament it's prophecy
[46:00] written in word
[46:02] but there's a revelation to that that
[46:04] we've got to catch amen
[46:07] so let's read genesis 18 verse 20 and
[46:10] the lord said because the cry of sodom
[46:11] and gomorrah is great and because their
[46:13] sin is very grievous
[46:14] i will go down now and see whether they
[46:16] have done all together according to the
[46:17] cry of it now remember there's no record
[46:19] of him going down there
[46:21] he sends his two witnesses he sends his
[46:24] two
[46:25] minor prophets
[46:27] that's okay
[46:28] billy graham and oral roberts brother
[46:30] ram said
[46:32] and i will know and if not i will know
[46:34] and the men turned their faces from this
[46:36] and went toward sodom but look but
[46:38] abraham stood yet
[46:40] before the lord abraham was not going to
[46:41] let that man out of his sight
[46:44] he knew there was something coming from
[46:46] that man
[46:47] because that man had just told him that
[46:49] he's going to have a baby
[46:51] and he told what sarah said in the tent
[46:53] she giggled in her
[46:54] heart it's kind of strange that abraham
[46:57] got on the ground and laughed at god and
[46:58] god didn't do anything to him
[47:01] but sarah giggled in her heart and
[47:02] brother brown said god would have killed
[47:04] her if it hadn't been for abraham
[47:07] yeah and then then you take another
[47:09] prophet called abraham the same guy sent
[47:12] him down to wherever that was and
[47:15] the
[47:16] egyptian was going to marry her marry
[47:18] his wife
[47:20] and the
[47:21] holy ghost gives him a vision and says
[47:23] no you can't you don't need to do that
[47:25] he said and also by the way you need to
[47:27] go get abraham the one that lied to you
[47:30] that give
[47:31] that made this situation the way it is
[47:34] he give his life away you need to go
[47:36] call him to come pray for you
[47:40] that he'll restore the womb of the
[47:41] because they remember he closed all the
[47:43] wounds up they never had would never
[47:44] have a child after that
[47:46] kind of interesting how much he thought
[47:48] of abraham and that's kind of like me
[47:50] and you
[47:51] that's why the faith of abraham if we
[47:52] took abraham and took him from genesis
[47:55] 14 to genesis about 20
[47:58] how he's the father of our faith
[48:00] sometimes you just don't know it
[48:02] he laughs at god
[48:04] gives his wife away
[48:06] he thinks he hears the right thing and
[48:09] takes hagar listens to his wife
[48:15] but you got to look at the revelation
[48:18] that he was strong in faith you know why
[48:20] because god said he was going to have it
[48:22] right here didn't matter about the
[48:24] journey
[48:26] he was looking at the promise
[48:28] he was looking right here
[48:30] got the birdie in the buddha i said i
[48:32] don't know how in the world i'm going to
[48:33] have that baby but this man said i was
[48:35] going to have it so that's it that
[48:36] settles it
[48:37] and then when he did like we did he kind
[48:39] of tries to jump in there and mess
[48:40] everything up
[48:42] all right so now let's go to genesis
[48:45] 19
[48:47] and there came two angels to sodom and
[48:49] lots that in the gate
[48:51] we see what happened watch his
[48:52] revelation verse two says behold now my
[48:54] lords
[48:56] he sees both of them
[48:58] right he doesn't have a real revelation
[49:00] and we know what happened but now let's
[49:02] go to luke 17 verse 28
[49:05] because likewise as it was in the days
[49:06] of lot they did eat they drank they
[49:08] bought the soul that planted the
[49:09] building just like noah but now remember
[49:11] in noah it says in the days of the son
[49:13] of man now watch what it says here but
[49:15] the same day that lot went out of sodom
[49:17] it ran fire and brimstone from heaven
[49:18] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[49:20] it be in the day when the son of man is
[49:23] revealed
[49:25] that's why brother brown goes to luke 17
[49:28] 28 to 30.
[49:30] he says that's the promise of the son of
[49:32] man being
[49:34] revealed and we'll get to that
[49:36] in just a minute with a quote that we
[49:38] got here and we'll read it real quick
[49:39] and then we'll be done
[49:41] so now
[49:42] moses comes on the scene and i'm going
[49:45] to read something this afternoon
[49:47] about moses and we'll we'll just save it
[49:49] for later and then remember what
[49:51] happened to joshua joshua 5 13. now what
[49:54] happens in joshua 5 13. i was thinking
[49:56] about the other day do you know that
[49:59] yeah going up to joshua that's good
[50:02] right there and it came to pass when
[50:03] joshua was by jericho that he lifted up
[50:05] his eyes and looked and behold there
[50:07] stood a man over against him
[50:10] with a sword and drawn drawn
[50:12] in his hand
[50:15] he was a threat
[50:18] kids
[50:19] young adults
[50:21] god is not some 80 year old person
[50:25] 90 year old person sorry about y'all
[50:26] they're 80 or 90.
[50:29] sorry i'm not even going to look over
[50:30] that way
[50:34] god's not some 61 year old person either
[50:38] because he was so formidable that joshua
[50:40] pulled his sword
[50:44] he was so he was so in good shape
[50:47] he was so young
[50:50] he was a threat to joshua because joshua
[50:52] without a revelation at the moment
[50:55] went unto him and said
[50:57] are you for us
[50:59] are you against us
[51:03] and and god said nay
[51:07] no i i'm not no you don't understand
[51:10] you're fiction too
[51:11] but you don't understand at the moment
[51:13] nay but as captain of the host of the
[51:15] lord am i now come and joshua fell on
[51:18] his face of the earth and did worship
[51:20] and said unto him what saith my lord
[51:21] unto his servant
[51:23] the captain of the lord's host said unto
[51:24] joshua loose thy shoes from off thy feet
[51:26] i'll bet you well i don't say bad i'll
[51:28] guarantee you moses
[51:30] told joshua the story about the burning
[51:32] bush
[51:36] i'll promise you moses because remember
[51:38] he schooled joshua in all of his life
[51:40] trained him up to do everything right
[51:43] i'll i'll guarantee you he said
[51:46] when i was walking by that bush
[51:49] he said when god gave me this commission
[51:51] he told me to take my shoes off
[51:54] that i was standing on holy ground and
[51:56] when that happened right there
[51:58] joshua said
[52:00] my lord
[52:02] i
[52:03] he had he had two of and the captain of
[52:05] the lord's host senator joshua loose thy
[52:07] shoes from off thy feet for the place
[52:09] where on thou standest is holy and
[52:11] joshua did so i'll promise you joshua
[52:14] was a different man after he met that
[52:16] man he was a different guy but see that
[52:19] man was a formidable opponent he was not
[52:21] somebody that was like i've told you
[52:23] before when
[52:25] june was went to the baptist church and
[52:26] backslid a little bit and
[52:28] she uh got this little book that said
[52:31] experiencing god
[52:33] it looked like rip van winkle
[52:36] it was this old man wasn't jim
[52:39] this big picture of experiencing god and
[52:42] he has a staff in his hand
[52:44] and he's bent over like this he's
[52:46] looking at
[52:47] a beard down about right here long
[52:50] long gray hair
[52:52] remember in daniel 9 brother brown said
[52:55] he always wondered about that he said
[52:57] that's was not his
[52:58] hair when he talks about the white wig
[53:01] one he said that was a wig that he put
[53:03] on because the people in
[53:05] in um
[53:07] i think they still do it over in britain
[53:09] when they walk in that chamber they pull
[53:11] the
[53:12] it's a white wig he was a white wig one
[53:15] god's never had gray hair
[53:18] he's always been a young man
[53:21] amen
[53:24] why didn't mary think it was the
[53:25] gardener when he was standing in the
[53:26] garden he was he was the lord jesus
[53:28] changed back to a 20 year old man
[53:32] where have you took him
[53:34] but when she when he said mary
[53:36] she knew who he was
[53:38] amen so let's read this number four
[53:43] and number five and then we'll close
[53:45] while we'll get back to it this
[53:46] afternoon so now look the unveiling of
[53:48] god
[53:49] you ought to read that book
[53:52] notice now
[53:53] he came first as the prophet
[53:56] they crucified him his own crucified him
[53:59] he came as the son of man so the son of
[54:01] man is a prophet
[54:03] all right then after the holy spirit
[54:04] came he was then the son of god god is a
[54:07] spirit he was the holy spirit son of god
[54:10] he lived through the church ages as son
[54:12] of god in other words he was building
[54:14] his own body
[54:16] he took his body upon high standing on
[54:18] the right hand of the father stood there
[54:20] making intercession because that's what
[54:23] uh who was it stephen saw
[54:25] he saw jesus standing on the right hand
[54:26] of the father not standing on top of a
[54:28] right hand but in authority and power
[54:31] all right
[54:32] and after the holy ghost came he was
[54:34] then the son of god god is a spirit he
[54:37] was the holy spirit son of god he lived
[54:39] through the church age as the son of god
[54:41] like i said before
[54:42] just enough light to get them in the
[54:43] body of christ
[54:45] no seals no daniel 70 weeks
[54:49] no major doctrines
[54:51] paul didn't know a thing about a sale
[54:52] folks he died in 1856 and the seals
[54:55] didn't come out to ad-90 when
[54:57] john went over to patmos so he had
[54:59] already passed on but he spoke about him
[55:01] the whole time he just didn't know what
[55:02] to call them
[55:03] all right we know what to call them we
[55:06] can read the mystery of iniquity
[55:09] we can read those things and fit it in
[55:10] the seals because you know what god sent
[55:12] us a prophet
[55:14] now in the millennium he'll be son of
[55:16] david sitting upon the throne of his
[55:18] father david he is the son of david now
[55:20] he that's not now look he is the son of
[55:23] david comma he paused he said now to
[55:26] catch his next thought
[55:28] and remember between the son of god now
[55:30] see it was he always said son of man son
[55:33] of god son of david son of man son of
[55:35] god son of david everybody got that
[55:37] but remember between the son of god in
[55:40] the loudest in church age they put him
[55:42] out listen and
[55:44] excuse me in revelations 3 that's the
[55:46] son of man knocking trying to get back
[55:48] in that was a man standing there called
[55:50] jesus christ that's the son of man they
[55:52] had put that revelation out the door
[55:55] knock knock knock
[55:57] in the laodicean church age they put him
[55:59] out and in luke he said he would be
[56:01] revealed again as the son of man why did
[56:04] brother brown have to stand and he stood
[56:06] there in that coliseum and he said i
[56:09] indict this generation
[56:11] for the second crucifixion of the son of
[56:14] man in other words
[56:15] right
[56:17] god had to die in human flesh everybody
[56:19] understand that
[56:20] well they crucified him again and put
[56:23] him to an open shame that's why a
[56:24] prophet had to indict him
[56:26] that's why the son of man now has to be
[56:28] risen again from the dead
[56:31] dead denomination dead works
[56:35] all right look
[56:36] and he said he would be revealed again
[56:38] the son of man the prophet
[56:42] listen
[56:44] brother brown said the messenger of this
[56:46] whole church age was who the lord jesus
[56:49] christ
[56:50] amen
[56:52] christ came down in revelations 10.
[56:54] christ came down
[56:56] and sun's over on in wherever the
[56:58] mountain it was over there in arizona
[57:01] right
[57:02] brother brown didn't come
[57:04] christ came
[57:05] brother brown was already here brother
[57:07] brown said i was here
[57:09] when he was here i was just there when
[57:11] the picture was tough
[57:12] what a humble man
[57:14] knowing that though he was preaching
[57:16] that message of the son of man
[57:20] fulfilling the rest of it the scriptures
[57:22] tie perfectly together son of man son of
[57:24] god son of david what was it it's the
[57:26] same god all the time look just changing
[57:28] his form
[57:29] just like i said before in morphe you've
[57:31] changed his form to logos to word speech
[57:35] he comes down to where we can understand
[57:37] him he changed his form in morphe he
[57:39] just changed it's a great drama he is
[57:42] acting it out
[57:44] a great drama
[57:46] he's acting it out all right let's go to
[57:47] the next quote
[57:49] proving his word
[57:51] another good book you ought to read it
[57:52] too
[57:55] well i did bring it we'll talk about
[57:57] this a little bit
[58:00] this evening a little more in depth all
[58:01] right previous word after now after 1900
[58:05] years
[58:06] with the church ages past
[58:09] where is he talking about us he's right
[58:11] here
[58:12] 2 000 years the church ages were 2 000
[58:14] years ago
[58:16] a.d 30
[58:18] to 2021
[58:20] or somewhere around the time brother
[58:22] brown was talking here
[58:24] now watch all things that he prophesied
[58:26] of luther wesley we just went through
[58:28] and seen it drawn out
[58:30] and the moon came down and drawed it out
[58:32] and the lord drawed it on the board here
[58:33] for us and showed it now that's when he
[58:35] was preaching the church ages and come
[58:37] down himself and confirm confirmed it to
[58:39] be right after 1900 years
[58:42] and we're at the end of the loud to sin
[58:44] church age now when does the messenger
[58:46] come
[58:47] come on people the messenger comes at
[58:49] the end of the age
[58:51] not at the beginning he comes at the end
[58:53] of the age to bring his message
[58:56] all right
[58:58] he promised
[58:59] we're at the end of laodicean church age
[59:01] he promised in luke 17 30 that this same
[59:04] son of man he promised it
[59:06] would be revealed in the days like it
[59:08] was in sodom upon the earth
[59:11] did he do it
[59:13] does it have to come to pass it's
[59:15] impossible in other words it's
[59:16] impossible for it not to come to pass
[59:18] now remember he came in three names the
[59:20] son of man a prophet
[59:23] everybody got that
[59:24] all right stay with me just a minute
[59:26] y'all doing pretty good
[59:29] the son of god spirit that's the holy
[59:32] ghost everybody got that
[59:34] son of man was we saw him
[59:37] as hoffman painted him brother brown
[59:39] said that was close
[59:41] close as what he saw
[59:44] standing on earth in flesh
[59:47] that was the son of man and he
[59:48] prophesied he was a prophet
[59:52] and then when he left they killed him
[59:53] and he left
[59:56] he came back on the day of pentecost not
[59:58] with that same body again
[1:00:01] no no he was getting ready to build a
[1:00:03] body
[1:00:04] he was building a flesh body
[1:00:06] me and you
[1:00:07] amen
[1:00:09] so we're going to get to that that's
[1:00:10] going to be way over in this in the
[1:00:12] sermon where she is him
[1:00:15] amen
[1:00:17] she's not a part of
[1:00:20] she's not like him
[1:00:23] the devil is like him
[1:00:26] she is him
[1:00:28] we can't lose
[1:00:30] if we're him
[1:00:31] you cannot lose there's no way but our
[1:00:34] problem is we keep separating ourselves
[1:00:36] from him
[1:00:38] man has done it denomination well what
[1:00:40] happened on the mountain god said bring
[1:00:42] these people right here i'll talk to
[1:00:44] them the people come to the mountain
[1:00:45] they go nope don't want you to talk to
[1:00:46] us
[1:00:47] you got to talk through this man right
[1:00:49] here called moses and moses said i can't
[1:00:51] talk
[1:00:53] so god said
[1:00:54] don't worry you got a brother that can
[1:00:56] talk
[1:00:58] you tell him i'll tell you you tell him
[1:01:00] and him tell the people
[1:01:02] it's been that way ever since
[1:01:05] so it revealed in the last days does it
[1:01:06] have to come to pass now remember he
[1:01:08] come in three names the son of man a
[1:01:10] prophet the son of god the spirit so now
[1:01:12] he's working as the holy ghost his body
[1:01:14] is not on the earth
[1:01:17] we're his body
[1:01:19] can't have two bodies at the same time
[1:01:21] we're his body so we're here he's over
[1:01:24] in another dimension remember brother
[1:01:25] brown said i want to go see him he said
[1:01:27] you can't see
[1:01:28] he's in a higher dimension in other
[1:01:30] words he is now immortal
[1:01:33] these people you're seeing they're not
[1:01:35] immortal
[1:01:37] they got a body sitting back here on the
[1:01:39] earth
[1:01:40] jesus's body connected with him and he
[1:01:42] went and took it up in the seventh
[1:01:43] dimension that's where we're going to
[1:01:44] meet him at so now the son of david for
[1:01:47] the millennium but look but in between
[1:01:50] this conjunction roll it up so we all
[1:01:52] see it
[1:01:54] all the way on up
[1:01:56] now in between this conjunction so it's
[1:01:59] son of man son of god
[1:02:01] now we know son of david is to who
[1:02:05] the jews
[1:02:06] in the millennium he just said
[1:02:08] millennium
[1:02:10] for the millennium now is a millennium
[1:02:12] to me and you no
[1:02:14] it's not to the bride
[1:02:16] so what's he saying is he's saying that
[1:02:18] in between this conjunction now
[1:02:20] according to his own word and the day
[1:02:23] when the son of man shall be revealed
[1:02:25] now watch reveal himself as
[1:02:28] what
[1:02:29] not son of god
[1:02:32] will reveal himself
[1:02:34] in a different way
[1:02:37] god different
[1:02:39] no
[1:02:40] it's just more light
[1:02:43] it's just more revelation
[1:02:45] he will reveal himself though in a
[1:02:47] different way so listen that's why it's
[1:02:49] so important you stayed with the son of
[1:02:51] god revelation
[1:02:53] do you know
[1:02:54] we we make that quote
[1:02:57] i'll read the rest of this in a minute
[1:02:58] we make that or say the quote like on
[1:03:01] the
[1:03:02] on the questions and answers on the
[1:03:04] sales he said it's gone from you
[1:03:06] it's not for you
[1:03:08] right
[1:03:09] do you know what he was talking about
[1:03:12] he's telling them
[1:03:13] you're under the son of god revelation
[1:03:16] you're good christian people you love
[1:03:18] god you love the lord you le you know
[1:03:21] that jesus resurrected you know that
[1:03:22] he's in your heart listen brother brown
[1:03:24] could discern he knew that people had
[1:03:25] the holy ghost he knew who did and who
[1:03:28] didn't
[1:03:29] so he was saying go on as you are
[1:03:32] stay right there
[1:03:33] don't wind yourself away from it why
[1:03:35] because he knew they wasn't going to get
[1:03:36] to revelation
[1:03:38] in a different way
[1:03:40] because what is a revelation of the son
[1:03:42] of man the seals
[1:03:44] and he had just got preached to number
[1:03:46] six and they were asking about pantyhose
[1:03:49] should you wear pajamas at night
[1:03:51] he explained to father son holy ghost
[1:03:53] baptism for him for the hundred
[1:03:54] thousandth time
[1:03:56] preaching the greatest message they ever
[1:03:57] preached well see they were working
[1:03:59] under the son of god revelation they
[1:04:00] were working in that era that he said
[1:04:01] okay it's not for you
[1:04:04] it's coming in a different way
[1:04:06] and from 63 to 65 i believe that was the
[1:04:09] different way
[1:04:10] you and i got to catch that different
[1:04:11] way though to take a body change
[1:04:14] you can have the son of god and not take
[1:04:16] a body change but i don't believe you
[1:04:17] can have a full revelation of the son of
[1:04:19] man and miss the body change
[1:04:21] because he's the one that got changed
[1:04:23] he knows how to do it will reveal
[1:04:26] himself in a different way
[1:04:29] now what does that make malachi 4
[1:04:32] exactly right see the son of man will
[1:04:34] reveal himself not in the whole big
[1:04:36] denomination of things that we've had
[1:04:37] through the ages but he would manifest
[1:04:39] himself as son of man again
[1:04:42] to make manifest malachi 4 and in that
[1:04:44] day i will send you elijah the prophet
[1:04:46] he shall turn the hearts of the children
[1:04:47] back to the faith of the apostolic
[1:04:49] fathers away from all this
[1:04:50] denominationalism and come back to the
[1:04:52] original word
[1:04:54] again
[1:04:55] amen
[1:04:57] let me read this one real quick they
[1:04:59] don't have this one but watch this right
[1:05:00] here
[1:05:02] because listen there's always three
[1:05:04] classes of people
[1:05:06] that's what we'll be covering from now
[1:05:08] all the way through
[1:05:09] elijah in the meal offering 1960. we're
[1:05:11] living in the shadows of the end time
[1:05:13] there may not be a tomorrow night i
[1:05:15] don't know lord that's up to you it's a
[1:05:17] prayer he's praying but while it is yet
[1:05:19] possible that some could enter in
[1:05:20] tonight father i pray that you'll send
[1:05:22] the holy spirit
[1:05:23] you said as it was in the days of sodom
[1:05:25] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:05:26] of man
[1:05:28] in the days of sodom they had three
[1:05:30] classes of the people
[1:05:32] the sinner
[1:05:34] the lukewarm church member
[1:05:36] and the elect
[1:05:39] that was who was there the center got
[1:05:41] destroyed
[1:05:44] right
[1:05:45] lot was the lukewarm church
[1:05:48] and the elect was abraham
[1:05:51] that's why brother brown said we have
[1:05:53] three classes of people in every
[1:05:54] congregation right believer mate
[1:05:56] believer and unbeliever right
[1:05:59] sodomites lodites and abraham called out
[1:06:01] of the world the sodomites received two
[1:06:03] ministers with a great message
[1:06:05] and abraham's group received a sign
[1:06:08] and the sign was a man
[1:06:11] with dust on his clothes
[1:06:14] who knew abraham being a stranger and
[1:06:16] knew his wife sarah what her name was
[1:06:18] and told abraham with his back turned to
[1:06:20] the tent where sarah was why did she
[1:06:21] laugh oh god may the church wake up and
[1:06:24] see as jesus said as it was the days of
[1:06:26] sodom so shall it be at the coming of
[1:06:27] the son of man that same god would
[1:06:30] appear now hold on a minute
[1:06:33] we're going to read something here it's
[1:06:34] going to shock you
[1:06:36] that same god
[1:06:38] would appear in flesh
[1:06:41] of his
[1:06:45] can church read that one more time
[1:06:48] oh god may the church wake up and see as
[1:06:51] jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:06:53] sodom so shall it be at the coming of
[1:06:55] the son of man that same god would
[1:06:57] appear in the flesh of his church
[1:07:01] that's me and you
[1:07:05] and would show the same sign granted
[1:07:08] lord
[1:07:08] we ask in jesus name
[1:07:11] amen let's stand our feet
[1:07:12] musicians come
[1:07:15] he would appear in the flesh
[1:07:18] of his church
[1:07:21] and it was listen it's not a church
[1:07:24] it was his church
[1:07:26] amen
[1:07:31] but i like that quote there where he
[1:07:32] said he would reveal in a different way
[1:07:34] you brother wait are you saying i need
[1:07:36] another a different mindset yeah
[1:07:39] yeah you do
[1:07:40] i just read you what the quote said
[1:07:43] if he's going to reveal it to you in a
[1:07:44] different way
[1:07:46] then it's not the normal was jesus
[1:07:48] normal
[1:07:50] not to the people around him he wasn't
[1:07:51] normal
[1:07:55] now that doesn't make us crazy people
[1:07:57] not normal and we're not something
[1:07:58] different okay
[1:08:01] but jesus was considered
[1:08:04] a wine bibber
[1:08:07] a sinner
[1:08:09] the chiefest of sinners
[1:08:12] he hung around prostitutes and drunks
[1:08:14] all the time
[1:08:17] his disciples
[1:08:20] collectively
[1:08:21] except maybe matthew because he was a
[1:08:23] tax collector he had to know his numbers
[1:08:26] they couldn't got together and told you
[1:08:27] their abcs
[1:08:31] couldn't write their name right
[1:08:35] and that's what he used
[1:08:36] and we're looking for this and we're
[1:08:38] looking for this and we're looking for
[1:08:39] this
[1:08:41] he's in his church
[1:08:43] he's he's he's not coming back as the
[1:08:46] son of man
[1:08:47] he is here
[1:08:49] the son of man in his church but he's in
[1:08:52] his word first you gotta grab his word
[1:08:54] because that'll be in a different way
[1:08:59] and our thought process has got to be
[1:09:01] different
[1:09:04] move on up the statue of a perfect man
[1:09:08] move on up into the seals and the
[1:09:09] different things that were required
[1:09:11] listen it's a requirement
[1:09:13] i didn't make it
[1:09:14] god did
[1:09:16] but you know what to make a requirement
[1:09:18] brother brown said he had to make a way
[1:09:21] so who stops the way me and you
[1:09:24] we stopped the way to get there amen so
[1:09:26] let's open that thing up like i said
[1:09:28] first of the year whatever you got
[1:09:29] inside of you let it out
[1:09:32] if it's wrong but you need to let it out
[1:09:35] if it's god i'd like to see it
[1:09:37] amen i would i'd like to see it if it's
[1:09:40] god i want to see it if it's the devil i
[1:09:42] like to see it because we know when he
[1:09:43] gets out he's going to leave
[1:09:45] because we want him to be uncomfortable
[1:09:46] let's sing a song if you have a need
[1:09:49] oh
[1:09:50] yes
[1:09:52] oh yes i love this song
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:14] [Music]
[1:10:17] yes
[1:10:19] [Music]
[1:10:48] [Music]
[1:11:04] amen amen
[1:11:07] let him show it let him show it
[1:11:12] [Music]
[1:11:19] start acting like the child of a king
[1:11:25] [Music]
[1:11:38] can
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:46] [Applause]
[1:11:50] no
[1:11:51] yes
[1:11:54] [Music]
[1:12:01] is
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:20] praise
[1:12:24] [Music]
[1:12:29] amen if you're a child of the king you
[1:12:32] get what the king gets
[1:12:34] you get what the king gets
[1:12:37] i'm a child of the king
[1:12:41] he came and died the only the only king
[1:12:43] that i know that ever died
[1:12:46] to save
[1:12:47] the world
[1:12:49] but he could do it because he could come
[1:12:50] back inside of us not everybody else can
[1:12:52] do that just the lord jesus could do
[1:12:54] that but the son of man we're going to
[1:12:56] get into him a lot more because there's
[1:12:58] a lot of little intricacies that we need
[1:12:59] to talk about for the son of man in a
[1:13:02] different way
[1:13:03] now listen you're not going to hear it
[1:13:05] no different what brother they'll preach
[1:13:06] then
[1:13:07] so don't think we're getting something
[1:13:08] that we found a new book
[1:13:10] or a new tape or we've talked to this
[1:13:12] new preacher
[1:13:13] nope you're going to hear the same thing
[1:13:15] but you know what i'm praying that it'll
[1:13:16] be given in a light
[1:13:19] and a light that will help you
[1:13:23] and they'll give us revelation to get
[1:13:24] out of here
[1:13:25] because it will have to be revealed in a
[1:13:27] different way you think about brother
[1:13:28] brown from that 1963 to
[1:13:30] 1965 he preached to people in a trailer
[1:13:33] and had 30 people in the trailer and it
[1:13:35] was an old run down trailer somewhere
[1:13:37] out in arizona
[1:13:39] 30 people and he used to preach to 30
[1:13:41] 000.
[1:13:43] 30.
[1:13:46] and when he was coming back from
[1:13:49] from
[1:13:50] texas and he was going to jeffersonville
[1:13:51] he was going to preach on the trail the
[1:13:53] serpent and he said they'd they'd be
[1:13:54] more than that going to be leaving him
[1:13:56] so he would have literally stood alone
[1:13:57] by itself just like the lord jesus did
[1:14:00] and that's the same way with you and i
[1:14:01] money women in popularity
[1:14:05] i don't ever want to be popular
[1:14:07] i want to be well known but i don't ever
[1:14:09] want to be popular
[1:14:10] because popularity would go to your head
[1:14:12] hey man and the money and the way i'm
[1:14:15] money i'll never have them women i got
[1:14:16] one that's enough
[1:14:20] hey man
