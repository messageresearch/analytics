[21:27] i want to read you something real quick
[21:28] before we before we start
[21:30] this this is in a resume of the church
[21:32] ages i was just thinking about some
[21:34] things that i said this morning
[21:36] brother brown tells us he says he's
[21:37] talking about denominations protestants
[21:39] nicoletism
[21:41] humanizing the leadership of the church
[21:43] and disposing deposing the spirit
[21:46] he says you see they are ignorant but if
[21:49] the rapture should take place at this
[21:50] moment ignorance would be no court of
[21:53] appeal
[21:55] listen
[21:55] ignorance would be no court of appeal
[21:57] from the judgment of god for being in
[22:00] the wrong ranks
[22:05] one more time
[22:06] you see they are ignorant
[22:08] but if the rapture should take place at
[22:10] this moment now that's
[22:12] 1960-something one or two
[22:14] ignorance would be no court of appeal
[22:17] from the judgment of god for being
[22:19] in the wrong
[22:20] ranks
[22:24] you believe brother brown was a prophet
[22:26] okay then you got to believe what he
[22:28] said
[22:29] all right so let's bow our heads dear
[22:30] heavenly father we thank you for this
[22:31] day that you give us
[22:33] we pray now that you would help us in
[22:35] this journey lord
[22:37] we know one thing's for sure that the
[22:39] battle is going to get harder
[22:41] but the victory's also sweeter
[22:44] victory is mine
[22:46] through jesus christ and no one else
[22:49] we're not preaching that we're going to
[22:51] be so great lord you know we're trying
[22:53] to get the people to see how great you
[22:55] are
[22:56] and how great you are that you've
[22:57] decided to live in a group of people
[22:59] called your bride
[23:00] and that you are going to manifest
[23:02] yourself just like you did 2 000 years
[23:04] ago walking on the earth in just one man
[23:07] you're gonna do it in thousands of bride
[23:09] around the world
[23:10] and lord we're looking for that time
[23:12] we appreciate you sending us a prophet
[23:14] lord without him we couldn't say these
[23:16] things
[23:17] and lord at this quote here lord it just
[23:20] rings in my heart that
[23:22] that if we need to get on the bus we
[23:24] need to be at the bus station
[23:26] we need to be there and ready to go
[23:28] father i pray that you would help us to
[23:30] do that lord
[23:32] i believe you have given us a roadmap i
[23:34] believe you have give us a gps god's
[23:36] predestinated seed
[23:38] lord i believe you give us that they'll
[23:40] take us if we'll just let it
[23:44] out and let it work
[23:46] father we pray that you'll be with us
[23:47] furthermore service bless us in jesus
[23:48] name amen
[23:52] you know i read a book one time
[23:54] and
[23:55] i cannot remember the name of it i think
[23:56] i still have it in my
[23:58] in my little library over there or
[24:00] something maybe dave ramsey gave to me
[24:01] but
[24:02] it was a book that a man wrote
[24:06] he said you know he said
[24:08] anything you do is kind of like a bus
[24:12] you can be on the right bus
[24:17] you can be going in the right direction
[24:21] you can have the motor running
[24:24] but the wrong person in the driver's
[24:26] seat
[24:29] and the wrong position of the people
[24:33] in the bus
[24:35] right people
[24:37] right bus
[24:38] motor running right direction
[24:41] but you're not in your position
[24:43] that's what we're going to talk about
[24:44] today being in in position
[24:47] amen
[24:48] you get on the bus you've got people
[24:50] that sit in the front you've got people
[24:51] sitting the back you got people that are
[24:52] tour guides you got people that are
[24:53] there that are that different ones
[24:56] if you have the tour guide which may be
[24:58] blind driving the bus disaster
[25:02] but if you put everybody in the right
[25:04] place
[25:05] that's why i read that about the wrong
[25:06] ranks being in the wrong race at the
[25:08] time of the rapture is no excuse
[25:10] and man brother dale's quoted that a
[25:12] thousand times and i tried to look it up
[25:13] the way i just quoted it and it ain't
[25:15] quoted that way it's quoted like this
[25:16] right here but it's the same thing
[25:17] paraphrasing being at the wrong being in
[25:19] the wrong ranks of the rapture is no
[25:21] excuse
[25:22] but there's no court of appeal brother
[25:23] ram said if you're in the wrong ranks at
[25:26] the time of the rapture man so let's
[25:28] just pray that we'll get to that
[25:30] i i don't i don't listen i don't
[25:32] discount anybody if you want to discount
[25:34] yourself that's fine but i don't
[25:35] discount anybody i think we're all going
[25:37] to make it
[25:38] i think we've all got a position to
[25:39] fulfill too
[25:41] right and then
[25:43] when the bride realizes who she is and
[25:45] what's she doing here
[25:46] she being invincible army i believe
[25:48] we're getting to that place
[25:50] to understanding who we are
[25:52] and what we're doing here and man let's
[25:53] go to john 1
[25:55] 1-14
[25:57] in the beginning was the word the word
[25:58] was with god and the word was god
[26:01] come on levi
[26:12] levi
[26:16] something wrong with it
[26:17] uh oh
[26:19] malfunction
[26:21] we have become malfunction junction here
[26:23] the past couple of weeks
[26:25] you all need to pray for this internet
[26:27] thing
[26:28] we good oh you gotta turn the thing on
[26:30] okay
[26:31] all right well we can and the word was
[26:33] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[26:35] behold his glory the glory of the only
[26:37] begotten of the father full of grace
[26:39] and truth you may be seen in the lord as
[26:41] blessing to the reason of the word and
[26:42] we were talking this morning
[26:45] therefore when he cometh into the world
[26:46] sacrifice and offering that what is not
[26:48] but a body has thou prepared me and look
[26:50] this body has to be
[26:52] brother brown tells us many times that
[26:55] that we can be that we can have the word
[26:57] that was talking about the bus we can
[26:59] have the word
[27:00] and we can dislocate it
[27:03] we can mis we can misplace it
[27:06] but it be the word
[27:09] because listen
[27:10] truly the denominations are the or the
[27:12] world that preaches a father son holy
[27:14] ghost baptism is true
[27:18] jesus said
[27:20] and that's the way we baptize
[27:22] we baptize according to jesus telling
[27:25] the disciples you'll hear us when we
[27:27] baptize people
[27:28] in accordance with jesus telling the
[27:31] apostles to go into all the world preach
[27:33] the gospel baptizing them in the name of
[27:36] the father and of the son and of the
[27:38] holy ghost i now baptize you my brother
[27:41] or sister in the name of the lord jesus
[27:43] christ because we're doing exactly what
[27:45] god told us to do
[27:46] we know what the father is we know what
[27:48] the son is we know what the holy ghost
[27:49] is it's the lord jesus christ but to
[27:51] fulfill that scripture he did listen the
[27:54] problem with us is message believers
[27:55] sometimes when we see a false doctrine
[27:58] or we see um
[28:00] the denominations preach that and take
[28:02] that father-son holy ghost baptism we
[28:04] say oh well that's there's something
[28:06] wrong with that scripture it's just not
[28:07] right no it's exactly what he said
[28:10] please let's don't dis dislocate that
[28:12] scripture
[28:13] well the denominations take this
[28:15] scripture but we take this one no you
[28:16] can't fight scripture with scripture
[28:19] they either both right or both wrong
[28:21] all right so that's the same way with
[28:23] what we see now the body now has
[28:25] prepared me go to hebrews 10.
[28:27] but a body has now prepared me now
[28:29] you've got to decide whether you're in
[28:30] the body but god is going to build a
[28:33] body
[28:34] he's going to have a bride on the earth
[28:37] in the end time that's not going to be
[28:39] at the wrong ranks they're going to know
[28:40] who they are and what they're doing here
[28:42] all right now that's a promise
[28:44] everybody believe brother brown was a
[28:46] prophet
[28:47] okay all right then we got to understand
[28:48] what he's saying
[28:49] let's go to ephesians 5 verse 23
[28:52] for the husband is the head of the wife
[28:54] and i'm going to try to fly through this
[28:56] because we went through it this morning
[28:58] for the husband is the head of the wife
[28:59] even as christ is the head of the church
[29:01] and he is the savior of the body now
[29:02] remember
[29:06] there was a bridegroom
[29:08] listen to me just a minute
[29:10] there was a bridegroom that came to the
[29:13] old testament
[29:15] hello
[29:17] to marry his first bride israel
[29:20] amen
[29:23] you've seen many scriptures in the old
[29:24] testament of the voice of the bride and
[29:27] the voice of the bridegroom is not heard
[29:28] in her anymore why it's left
[29:31] there's only one bride and this is the
[29:32] end time people who we are that's alive
[29:34] now there's pride down through the
[29:36] church ages we know that
[29:37] but this group of people is supposed to
[29:40] hear from the bridegroom and then make
[29:42] him manifest because we it took a
[29:44] prophet to tell us that the scriptures
[29:46] that spoke of the bride groom
[29:50] also speaks to the bride
[29:52] so whatever the bridegroom gives we're
[29:53] heirs and joiners with christ it took a
[29:55] prophet to tell us that
[29:57] amen
[29:58] and the prophet told us that he said
[30:00] look
[30:02] husbands
[30:03] you're the head of your wife even as
[30:05] christ is the head of the church now how
[30:06] did that happen
[30:09] how did it happen
[30:11] before the fall they were co-equal
[30:14] before the fall
[30:18] eve's headship was christ
[30:21] or the father whoever you want to say
[30:23] the one who came down to cool today and
[30:24] talked to both of them equally he didn't
[30:27] have any secrets for the for the adam
[30:30] and
[30:30] no
[30:31] the one that had the secret was the
[30:33] serpent and he got involved in between
[30:34] them and that's what caused the problem
[30:37] but remember they were co-equal
[30:39] that's why paul could tell us in romans
[30:41] that we're heirs and joint heirs with
[30:43] christ
[30:44] in other words he has restored us back
[30:47] to full fellowship
[30:50] bride and bridegroom won
[30:53] but now since what happened with the
[30:55] fall the husband has to be the head of
[30:57] the wife
[30:59] as christ is the head of the church man
[31:01] let's don't drag our wives around by the
[31:02] hair with a club on their back and drag
[31:03] them into the
[31:04] into the cave
[31:06] unless you want god to grab you by the
[31:07] hair and drag you into the cave
[31:09] amen
[31:12] but that's the order that we got to go
[31:14] in i want you to listen this because
[31:15] we're going to go all the way to the
[31:16] very end
[31:18] and i want you to look at something here
[31:20] i think i brought it
[31:24] [Music]
[31:25] yes
[31:26] all right so the husband is head of the
[31:28] wife even as christ is the head of the
[31:29] church and he is the savior of this body
[31:33] that he is building
[31:35] all right everybody got that all right
[31:36] so let's go now to colossians 1 18. for
[31:39] he is the head of the body the church
[31:41] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[31:42] the dead and all things he might have
[31:44] the preeminence and i read you what that
[31:46] brother russ was talking about this
[31:47] morning do we give him preeminence
[31:49] listen it's nothing there's nothing
[31:50] wrong with going on vacation there's
[31:52] nothing wrong with making money there's
[31:53] nothing wrong with having a nice house
[31:55] but if you put that before god
[32:00] and if you say that is my success is
[32:03] because
[32:07] you understand what i'm saying
[32:10] listen there's a lot of dirt filthy
[32:12] people filthy rich people in this world
[32:15] that are horrible
[32:18] why they say filthy rich
[32:20] why they say filthy rich
[32:22] but there is
[32:24] this going to hell and if they don't
[32:25] give their life to god they're going to
[32:26] bust they'll wide open and have billions
[32:29] and billions of dollars why they didn't
[32:30] put god first but then you got somebody
[32:32] that i believe like stewart kathy the
[32:34] chick-fil-a founder we ain't working on
[32:36] sunday
[32:37] we're gonna do more business on monday
[32:39] through thursday on monday through
[32:40] saturday that mcdonald's does 24 hours a
[32:42] day seven days a week and they passed
[32:44] that just a few years ago
[32:46] in six days
[32:48] they do and have you ever been listening
[32:51] me and jim grew up working for
[32:52] mcdonald's but you look at the people
[32:54] that hire chick-fil-a and you look at
[32:56] the people they hire at mcdonald's
[32:59] those chick-fil-a people are nice
[33:02] you have a good experience when you go
[33:04] there i don't care if the listen the
[33:06] drive-through at mcdonald's if it's if
[33:08] it's y'all quit lifting the drive
[33:10] through at mcdonald's would can be lined
[33:12] out into the street and they'd be
[33:14] cussing and fussing
[33:15] chick-fil-a the lines will be wrapped
[33:17] around the building and out into the
[33:19] street and they're like just as happy as
[33:20] they can be and you know what that makes
[33:22] you happy yeah what are you saying
[33:24] brother wait listen stewart cassidy put
[33:26] god first
[33:27] now he might have not been a message
[33:29] believer come on people good grief
[33:31] there's going to be more people in
[33:32] heaven that don't believe this message
[33:33] than our
[33:39] there's only a small group of people
[33:40] that knows that god sent a prophet in
[33:42] the end time
[33:43] small group compared to seven billion
[33:45] people in the world
[33:47] let's go turn them out
[33:49] let's bring them in
[33:51] let's be salty
[33:53] because you know what
[33:54] i like to go to chick-fil-a now the
[33:56] reason we don't all the time jun don't
[33:57] like their french fries
[33:59] but i do so
[34:01] i bow to her every once in a while we go
[34:03] somewhere else but i need chick-fil-a
[34:05] all the time why it's a good experience
[34:07] good food good experience and i'm not
[34:09] i'm not just when i get get finished and
[34:12] look at one of my mcdonald's five
[34:13] minutes in the drive-through and haven't
[34:15] got your order yet
[34:16] it makes you a little bit upset
[34:18] oh oh temperance
[34:21] temperance
[34:24] and you white brother kindness out
[34:26] you got to have tempers first
[34:30] i'm just saying
[34:31] you oughta we ought to
[34:32] be able to even in our life to look and
[34:35] see
[34:36] who has
[34:37] who has lived a godly life
[34:39] and how that that their
[34:42] their uh economy their children all
[34:45] different ones i mean we got you know we
[34:47] got some of this but you take most
[34:49] people that try their best to live a
[34:51] christian life
[34:53] and god will
[34:54] bless them
[34:57] remember tithing is not
[35:00] just for the bride
[35:02] and to pour out the windows of heaven is
[35:04] not just for the bride
[35:07] the poor out of the windows of heaven is
[35:09] for everybody
[35:11] now you may not go to heaven
[35:14] but you sure will be blessed if you're
[35:16] not born again
[35:18] you're not going to heaven i don't care
[35:19] if you pay 90
[35:21] but see the right ranks the right order
[35:24] if you go the right order everything
[35:26] will work out i promise you
[35:28] you can tell when people don't pay
[35:30] tithes
[35:32] it don't take brother branham to be here
[35:34] to be a prophet to discern who pays
[35:37] tithes who don't
[35:39] so don't think you're hiding anything
[35:43] and i listen i don't look at the title
[35:45] book it ain't none of my business
[35:49] really ain't nobody's business
[35:53] just saying
[35:56] but he's the head of the body of the
[35:57] church who's the beginning the firstborn
[35:59] from the dead and then all things he
[36:00] might have the premise that's where we
[36:01] got to him preeminence
[36:04] but if we don't see though
[36:06] if we give him the preeminence what are
[36:08] we doing with it after that
[36:12] turn it over to god and then take it
[36:13] back away from him how many times have
[36:15] you turned your children over to god
[36:17] come on people
[36:19] raise your hand everybody every every
[36:21] parent in this room raise your hand
[36:23] you give them over to god and then you
[36:25] took them back
[36:28] [Music]
[36:30] that's just human
[36:33] brother brown said turn them over to god
[36:35] and let them go
[36:38] let them go
[36:40] regardless i told my you know my kids
[36:42] are not here today but
[36:45] i said god save their soul i don't care
[36:46] if they're laying dead almost dead in
[36:49] the street
[36:50] give them time
[36:52] to repent
[36:53] give them time to repent because you
[36:55] know what i want to see them for an
[36:56] eternity
[36:57] if you don't have a desire to see your
[36:59] kids
[37:00] for 15 minutes while we're on this side
[37:04] i don't know why i'm doing this but
[37:07] but really
[37:08] if your kids ignore i mean
[37:10] never mind
[37:11] anyway
[37:12] what's going to happen over yonder

[37:21] somehow in this world y'all gotta learn
[37:23] to love me

[38:16] people
[38:17] will never like you because your spirit
[38:19] irritates their demons
[38:20] [Music]
[38:25] i'm glad we're family
[38:27] but we do have family arguments every
[38:29] once in a while so it's okay
[38:31] but he's the head of the body of the
[38:32] church but listen we got to have
[38:34] headship we've got to have somebody to
[38:37] lead us that's what god said it's not
[38:38] something i did
[38:40] it's something god did
[38:41] god said you've got to have apostles
[38:43] prophets pastors teachers and
[38:44] evangelists oh sister lily you weren't
[38:46] in when i read that let me read that
[38:47] again
[38:49] go ahead you've heard it before about
[38:51] irritating my irritating demons
[38:57] i'm glad we got some said yeah yeah this
[39:00] police say yes they all said please say
[39:01] yes let's get on with this
[39:04] but he's the head of the body of the
[39:05] church who's the beginning the firstborn
[39:07] from the dead then in all things he
[39:08] might have the preeminence let's go to
[39:09] romans 8 verse 14 we're going to enter
[39:11] into that
[39:12] we'll probably do this next sunday or
[39:14] sunday afternoon
[39:15] let's talk about romans because as
[39:17] brother bob's preaching on three stages
[39:19] of of of grace
[39:21] there's three stages of adoption brother
[39:23] that was preached on it many many times
[39:25] but we've got some newer ones in here
[39:26] and we
[39:27] we want to bring it out again there's
[39:29] definitely according to romans
[39:31] if you'll read romans 8 read the whole
[39:32] chapter that just really gives you the
[39:34] whole walk of a christian
[39:35] even if the spirit of him that that
[39:37] raised up jesus from the dead dwelling
[39:38] in you he'll also quicken your mortal
[39:40] body
[39:42] hold on a minute your mortal body
[39:45] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[39:47] so let's wrote romans 8 14 for as many
[39:50] are led by the spirit of god they are
[39:52] the sons of god now that's your
[39:53] born-again experience that starts in
[39:56] verse 14 and it continues on we'll not
[39:58] read all of it for ye have not received
[40:00] the spirit of bondage again listen
[40:02] you're in bondage as we were talking
[40:04] about this morning you're in bondage by
[40:06] the law
[40:07] the law will bind you
[40:09] grace will set you free
[40:11] and man grace will set you free that's
[40:13] why the headstone comes in jerubal is
[40:16] crying what not just grace
[40:18] grace grace unto it
[40:20] double grace is what we're going to have
[40:22] to have to get out of here for we have
[40:24] not received the spirit of bondage again
[40:26] to fear
[40:28] but we have received the spirit of
[40:29] adoption
[40:31] whereby we cry daddy daddy
[40:34] and that's the way you get started in
[40:35] your journey you become a christian
[40:38] if you ever remember you ought to
[40:39] remember you ought to just let that run
[40:41] through your mind maybe it'll keep you
[40:42] awake run through your mind of how you
[40:44] got started
[40:46] and how when i remember when i was a
[40:48] christian a young christian there in 99
[40:51] and received the holy ghost there
[40:53] in kentucky come back here and then
[40:55] started
[40:56] opening services like terence does and i
[40:57] started doing bible study or sun school
[40:59] class and then god called me to preach
[41:02] but i can see myself going through that
[41:06] that i needed something
[41:08] but you know i just asked
[41:11] and god gave it to me
[41:15] first six eight months maybe a year i'd
[41:17] ask things
[41:18] and he just silver platter
[41:22] why because i was a baby
[41:25] i needed child training though but at
[41:27] that moment you don't spank a child when
[41:29] they're three months old
[41:32] if they don't know what they're doing
[41:33] wrong they're not going to process
[41:36] but as they get older
[41:38] yeah
[41:42] and that nerve in that rear end goes all
[41:44] the way to the brain
[41:46] some of them not so much
[41:51] but that's what god did for me i don't
[41:53] know if he did that for you but but now
[41:56] but now
[41:59] where are you
[42:00] lord then the last three things i asked
[42:04] i ain't got no email no text
[42:06] nothing
[42:08] hey man why
[42:10] grow up baby
[42:14] grow up baby i don't have to go crying
[42:15] to mom and dad say oh oh my dad i'm
[42:18] having a rough time
[42:19] i'm having a rough time you know what
[42:21] they tell me go back home
[42:25] you chose this road
[42:27] you live it
[42:29] that's the way god is folks
[42:31] for us to see what god does to us is to
[42:33] see what you're doing in your life
[42:36] and you know more than anybody else how
[42:39] you and god deal with each other
[42:41] hello
[42:42] you know
[42:44] because you either take the devil with
[42:45] you all the time or you take god with
[42:47] you all the time and you know that
[42:49] now there is times where you do it's
[42:51] like brother dale said how many times do
[42:53] you
[42:54] question your new birth he said every
[42:55] morning
[42:56] you do because you say mine why did i do
[42:58] that but there's guys come a time where
[43:00] you put that state down and say uh
[43:04] we're not going back no more
[43:06] we're going forward we're gonna hey
[43:08] we're on the right bus
[43:11] we're going in the right direction we
[43:12] may not know which seat is ours
[43:16] not yet but that's okay at least we got
[43:18] the bus into going in the right
[43:19] direction and we know we're on the right
[43:21] bus
[43:22] the right place
[43:25] amen but not in the wrong ranks
[43:28] no excuse the prophet said
[43:30] but we receive the spirit of adoption
[43:32] listen when you get born again you
[43:33] receive the spirit of adoption every one
[43:35] of you do
[43:37] whether you want to make it or not you
[43:39] know whether you want to go up a statute
[43:40] of perfect man if you're born again
[43:41] today you're a child of god just like
[43:43] brother brown was a child of god
[43:47] you got to decide
[43:50] how far you want to grow up
[43:52] amen because you know what we baby feed
[43:55] people
[43:57] babies
[43:59] until when
[44:01] it'd be real strange if we go downstairs
[44:04] between services
[44:06] and sarah's having to feed levi's mouth
[44:08] you know
[44:11] looks like he's doing a pretty good job
[44:12] doing himself
[44:13] but
[44:14] it wouldn't not be strange though to
[44:17] walk into a room and here's a 15 year 16
[44:20] year old kid and his mama's spoon
[44:22] feeding him and he's going
[44:25] [Music]
[44:26] listen what would you think it would be
[44:28] something mental
[44:29] well see i think it's something
[44:31] spiritual
[44:32] that's the way god will see something
[44:33] spiritual if he's still gotta spoon feed
[44:35] you
[44:38] what
[44:41] do like we used to do here comes the bus
[44:43] open up here comes the bus
[44:46] now god will do that for a
[44:48] while because he's a good god
[44:52] but you know at one time point in time
[44:53] he told moses he said look buddy grow up
[44:57] grow up why cry moses
[45:00] speak
[45:01] and go forward that's what god's want
[45:03] he's never listened to me he's never had
[45:05] a bride on the earth
[45:07] since he came himself he's never had a
[45:09] bride that could speak the word like
[45:11] this group of people gonna be able to
[45:13] speak the word
[45:14] cannot will not
[45:17] because you and i
[45:19] i've got a quote in there i'll bring it
[45:21] next time
[45:22] where brother brown said
[45:25] tell me my brother my sister
[45:29] when has god filled the church as he's
[45:30] going to feel in the end time
[45:33] he said just for a moment

[45:38] see
[45:38] another jesus christ on the earth not
[45:41] just of not just as speaking
[45:43] but in action

[45:46] trouble what do we do now when we get in
[45:48] trouble well i know what your kids do
[45:50] you start lying
[45:52] just kidding just kidding
[45:55] i'm lying
[45:58] but the bible tells us that if you're
[46:00] sent before what
[46:02] if you're sent before governments
[46:05] figures
[46:08] he said don't even think what you're
[46:10] going to say
[46:12] now what's the third first thing we do
[46:13] we start trying to figure that out
[46:15] hello
[46:17] we gonna we start going wait a minute
[46:20] what angle can i take
[46:23] to to
[46:24] to make that cop
[46:26] just give me a warning ticket
[46:30] oh i tell him i i gotta get my mother
[46:32] sitting in the hot you guys start lying
[46:37] most of the time if you're just telling
[46:38] the truth look i wasn't looking at the
[46:39] speedometer sometimes they'll give you
[46:41] that but anyway with god it's the same
[46:43] way
[46:44] we try to get out of stuff
[46:46] just admit it
[46:48] god i'm a sinner
[46:50] i'm lost i'm talking about people that's
[46:51] not born again just admit it
[46:53] even people has been in a message 30
[46:55] years we've ought to sit down one saying
[46:56] look god
[46:58] what's wrong with me
[47:00] and he's going to say you're what's
[47:02] wrong with you
[47:04] i'm not what's wrong with you you can't
[47:06] blame god for stuff you do
[47:08] right
[47:09] we okay can i preach a little bit this
[47:11] afternoon
[47:13] but he's creating himself a body
[47:16] so he's always had the right bus
[47:21] he knew what he was going to have he was
[47:24] going to have seven church ages
[47:26] with seven stars
[47:28] and seven spirits
[47:30] real simple
[47:32] but the one in the end time is the one
[47:34] that's gonna have to be able to drive
[47:36] the bus
[47:37] to where it's going on its destination
[47:39] and see you can have all that look you
[47:41] can have all the 50 people at 50 people
[47:43] supposed to ride the bus and one guy's
[47:44] supposed to drive it what's the driver
[47:46] don't show up
[47:48] or what if the driver
[47:50] he says i think i'll ride this i'll ride
[47:52] the bus today
[47:54] the bus ain't going nowhere
[47:58] he's the driver and he's on the bus
[48:00] the motor's running
[48:02] but he says no i'm not the driver i'm
[48:04] this over here
[48:05] wrong ranks
[48:10] but somebody's gotta get an in drive
[48:11] that bus
[48:13] and i'm talking about your bus
[48:15] i'm talking about you driving your bus
[48:17] with your family and your kids and all
[48:19] the things that you do all your job and
[48:21] everything you the one that's got to
[48:22] take control
[48:27] folks it's got to be
[48:29] but it's not somebody like moses to rise
[48:31] up to take us over because moses didn't
[48:35] take us over
[48:38] moses died
[48:39] the prophet of the end time passed away
[48:42] but he showed us the promised land
[48:45] he showed us where to go and then he
[48:48] sent not
[48:50] not
[48:51] the third in line or or the the pot
[48:54] washer or the gravedigger
[48:57] joshua was his warrior standing right
[48:59] there beside him
[49:01] and god spoke to joshua the same as he
[49:03] spoke to moses as i was with moses
[49:07] so i want to tell you today just as god
[49:09] was with william branham
[49:12] except in the prophetic him being a
[49:14] seventh messenger but i thought under
[49:16] the seventh messenger we were the voice
[49:18] of the final voice of the final age
[49:20] so he has instilled in us
[49:23] joshua you're going to take them over we
[49:25] were talking about this today
[49:27] i've been reading a little book and it's
[49:29] not it's not a message book
[49:32] not a message believer either
[49:35] but he does a real good job to show how
[49:36] everybody was placed in the land
[49:39] but do you know some of their land was
[49:41] so big you know what god told them
[49:42] though he said when you get in this land
[49:44] you drive every ite out of that land
[49:50] kill them all
[49:51] drive them out that's your property
[49:55] you know what happened
[49:56] they got lazy
[49:59] they got lazy and some of their
[50:00] properties was so big until they didn't
[50:02] drive everybody out they just said oh
[50:04] they're up there in the north part of
[50:06] ghad we're just going to leave them
[50:08] alone
[50:09] and you know what that was their
[50:10] downfall every one of them
[50:12] all them ites
[50:14] standing out of churchite
[50:17] not reading your bible light
[50:19] looking at the wrong website
[50:22] and all them otherites
[50:24] amen
[50:26] that's what's wrong with me i don't know
[50:27] about y'all i'm preaching to me today
[50:28] okay y'all can just take it if you need
[50:30] to if you don't if you've already passed
[50:32] all that
[50:33] you sleep
[50:36] but this is for us people we got to see
[50:38] who we are yeah and what we're doing
[50:40] here and who's our leader who was the
[50:42] lead josh sure joshua but joshua type to
[50:44] what the holy ghost
[50:47] the holy ghost placed you we'll talk
[50:49] about that in a little while
[50:50] is placing that's what we got to come to
[50:54] we got to come to placing
[50:56] right bus
[50:57] right people right driver right mechanic
[51:01] everything's got to be exactly right
[51:04] because it hasn't been right in the
[51:05] church ages
[51:09] i read you that quote
[51:10] where the prophet of god said they had
[51:12] just enough to get them saved
[51:14] just enough to get them on the bus
[51:18] just enough to get them on the bus but
[51:20] they didn't go anywhere they didn't know
[51:22] where to go
[51:25] so
[51:26] an adversary gets on the bus and says
[51:28] i'm the driver
[51:31] and t takes them to down a false
[51:33] doctrine
[51:34] gets on a baptist bust or a pentecostal
[51:36] buzzer
[51:37] what a brand of might bus whatever you
[51:39] want to say
[51:41] i like what brother brown said in the
[51:42] rest of this quote i didn't read it he
[51:43] said it's not the people
[51:45] he said it's the system
[51:47] now listen can we be in a system
[51:53] i read you a quote the other day where
[51:54] brother brown says i don't know that
[51:55] we're getting them to christ he said i
[51:56] think we're getting them to an idea
[52:00] or theology
[52:02] or terminology
[52:05] our terminology is different than the
[52:07] world
[52:08] because we don't believe in three gods
[52:09] we don't believe in water baptisms in
[52:11] the name of fathers on holy ghost why
[52:12] our terminology is different but if
[52:14] that's just something you do as a ritual
[52:17] it'll do you no good
[52:19] that's what'll kill you
[52:21] that's why paul said the letter killeth
[52:24] but the spirit giveth life
[52:26] the letter
[52:27] of the law is what killed israel
[52:30] but the grace of god got israel into the
[52:33] promised land
[52:36] it was grace all the way through even
[52:38] when adam and eve did what they did it
[52:40] started grace right there
[52:41] actually grace started before the
[52:42] foundation of the
[52:44] world god slade himself remember slave
[52:48] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[52:49] world
[52:50] everybody all right
[52:52] but now we've got to come to this we
[52:54] talk about new creation and we'll try to
[52:55] jump through all that new creation a new
[52:57] race
[52:58] you and i are the aliens that that the
[53:02] earth has been looking for
[53:09] you ever thought about that
[53:13] we're supposed to be aliens right you
[53:14] know what the bible says
[53:16] we're supposed to be aliens we're not
[53:18] supposed to be like the world
[53:19] you see all these people how this
[53:21] superhuman race comes to earth
[53:24] becomes superman batman spiderman all
[53:27] these other people women too wonder
[53:28] woman all that stuff
[53:31] this is a superhero sitting here
[53:34] and it's not a comic book
[53:36] and it's not something you got to put on
[53:37] except christ
[53:39] a uniform won't save you captain america
[53:43] right they all had a flaw though
[53:45] remember
[53:46] but man has took that idea and said oh
[53:49] there's a superhuman race
[53:51] hitler wasn't far off
[53:54] but look what he'd done
[53:56] he killed 6.8 million
[53:59] human beings
[54:01] men women and children just because they
[54:03] were jews
[54:04] no other reason he wasn't mad at one guy
[54:07] because he was this no he was mad at the
[54:09] whole race
[54:11] you know why because they had his money
[54:14] but the mentality was i'm going to get
[54:17] rid of this race
[54:19] and make me a new one
[54:22] well
[54:22] the quote here says new creation new
[54:24] race how far off was he
[54:28] if he had to listen to god not listen to
[54:29] the devil
[54:31] he could have been a good preacher what
[54:32] brother branham say he wanted to talk to
[54:34] albert einstein
[54:36] see we had a spiritual einstein on the
[54:38] earth at the same time natural einstein
[54:40] was on the earth
[54:41] because you know by physics and by by
[54:43] even by mathematics
[54:46] he proved
[54:47] he
[54:48] einstein proved that if you could see an
[54:50] infinity you'd see the back of your head
[54:53] and that's the truth because what
[54:55] light travels in a circle
[54:58] light doesn't travel straight light
[54:59] travels in a circle
[55:01] so when you go so far to infinity and
[55:03] come back you see the back part of your
[55:04] head he proved that by what mathematics
[55:06] brother brown proved it
[55:08] by spiritual mathematics he put the word
[55:11] together
[55:12] he put this word together so me and you
[55:13] would have have a less hard time seeing
[55:16] what's going on like i said before if
[55:18] this message is hard you don't have the
[55:20] holy ghost
[55:24] oh
[55:26] i'm sorry
[55:27] i mean if you say i cannot understand
[55:29] this how can god
[55:31] give you something and then not let you
[55:33] to understand not let you have a
[55:36] something to understand it by
[55:39] there's a lot of things you can say look
[55:41] i don't understand that but you should
[55:43] never say i don't believe that
[55:46] that's the difference
[55:48] maybe i'm giving you some life lessons
[55:50] today
[55:51] you're staying awake a little bit more
[55:52] maybe it's okay we'll talk about life
[55:54] lessons more often
[55:56] husbands love your wife
[56:00] for you've not received the spirit of
[56:01] bondage again to fear that's what that's
[56:03] what the world what is what's going on
[56:05] in the world today
[56:07] everybody's scared of everything
[56:11] more than ever before
[56:15] you do that and about 20 people just
[56:16] fall
[56:18] and they go to doing this putting that
[56:20] sanitizer up
[56:24] man we used to play outside as kids kids
[56:26] were there old as me
[56:28] we used to play outside and my mama and
[56:30] daddy have to
[56:32] they're sitting right there they'd have
[56:33] to find us
[56:35] find us in the woods mom would scream
[56:37] supper
[56:39] if we wouldn't if we were already a mile
[56:41] or two out in the woods we didn't hear
[56:42] but you know what we come home
[56:45] we come home with
[56:47] tater patches around our neck anybody
[56:49] know oh sorry
[56:51] not an idaho tater patch
[56:53] i love you man
[56:54] but we did everybody who knows what a
[56:56] potato tater patch is
[56:58] donny
[56:59] huh
[57:00] me it's that real brown
[57:03] streak that runs around it what happens
[57:05] is all your sweat
[57:07] why i'm doing this i don't know all this
[57:09] sweat
[57:10] and dirt collects right here
[57:14] and you get a tater patch
[57:16] where you can grow taters around your
[57:18] neck if you were to plant them
[57:20] now today we sanitize everything
[57:24] we sanitize our kids we sanitize
[57:27] everything
[57:28] we never call it disease by having a
[57:30] tater patch
[57:34] what am i saying same thing with the
[57:35] gospel have we overstepped
[57:39] the simplicity of the gospel
[57:43] and thinks this is what we need to do we
[57:45] need to sanitize everybody
[57:47] you need to you know sneeze into your
[57:50] arms
[57:50] when they sent that out
[57:52] the other day well when it first got
[57:54] started they sent us a big you know
[57:56] we're federal i'm a federal employee so
[57:57] they send it to us first
[58:00] sneeze
[58:02] into your elbow
[58:03] i want y'all to try that
[58:06] no that ain't your elbow sister that's
[58:08] your elbow
[58:12] that's not your elbow that's your arm
[58:15] that's your elbow sneeze into your elbow
[58:18] that's why i think the the virus kept
[58:20] going people didn't sneeze in their
[58:22] elbow
[58:25] but that was instructions
[58:30] but how insane is that
[58:32] and how insane is it that
[58:35] us
[58:37] we want to be so protective
[58:40] and i know most of you in this room has
[58:41] had the virus before
[58:43] some bad case some not so bad case
[58:45] but come on
[58:48] how do these people that stay home
[58:52] never go out
[58:54] and they get the virus
[58:58] you snuck out went to walmart one day
[58:59] didn't you
[59:02] guarantee you
[59:06] huh
[59:08] think about it oh i'm not going to
[59:10] church because i might get or give
[59:13] but i got to go to walmart
[59:21] just saying
[59:25] the little things that we do or don't do
[59:29] affects all that
[59:32] and for god to be effective
[59:37] it's for us to listen to him
[59:40] now we said many times before you know
[59:42] the virus thing is some it's all a lot
[59:45] of it's political a lot of it's
[59:47] you know my stand on it i took one of
[59:49] the shots and i've been crazy ever since
[59:51] my body has my body
[59:54] not my brain
[59:57] but some of you didn't some of you
[59:58] didn't and that's okay you do whatever
[59:59] you want to do but what i'm saying is is
[1:00:01] when are we gonna just
[1:00:03] quit crying
[1:00:05] we're gonna quit crying
[1:00:07] say god
[1:00:08] i've had enough of this i'm going to
[1:00:10] church
[1:00:12] because remember what i just read you a
[1:00:13] couple a couple of days ago that the
[1:00:15] more you stay out of the church the more
[1:00:17] you don't want to go
[1:00:19] that's that's what it is it's the
[1:00:21] repetition that you get in that god
[1:00:22] wants you to get into that reputation
[1:00:25] repetition of going to church and then
[1:00:27] if you cut that repetition out look
[1:00:30] some people disappear and you never see
[1:00:32] him again
[1:00:35] just saying
[1:00:38] but we have an adversary folks that he's
[1:00:40] very very smart
[1:00:42] he's very very smart
[1:00:45] he actually is going to take this whole
[1:00:48] world
[1:00:49] and deceive him
[1:00:51] one man
[1:00:53] is going to deceive the whole world
[1:00:54] except the bride
[1:00:56] and when we leave
[1:00:58] he's got a hundred percent
[1:01:00] he's going to take a hundred percent of
[1:01:01] the people
[1:01:03] and persecute him all at the same time
[1:01:07] but he's here now
[1:01:08] he's trying to get me and you
[1:01:11] but we must believe
[1:01:16] that this whole body
[1:01:18] this body of believers
[1:01:20] there's a work for each one of you to do
[1:01:22] i want you to get into your place
[1:01:25] learn that position
[1:01:27] and stay in it
[1:01:31] husbands love your wives and we'll go
[1:01:32] through all that
[1:01:34] as
[1:01:35] he loves the church
[1:01:37] because we are his wife
[1:01:39] we're his bride
[1:01:40] and you are coming to a place
[1:01:43] let's skip all over all that
[1:01:46] i know second peter 1 verse 3 we'll talk
[1:01:48] about the the
[1:01:49] virtues we're going to get back and talk
[1:01:51] about the virtues but let's go
[1:01:53] um
[1:01:54] all the way to where we were at this
[1:01:55] morning to galatians 3 18
[1:01:58] which uh brother levi you're gonna have
[1:02:00] to scroll through
[1:02:02] it's hot up here
[1:02:04] what's it on over there
[1:02:08] lyre
[1:02:09] that thing's lying it's about 80 up here
[1:02:11] i got sweat and i'm not even trying
[1:02:14] all right let's go to galatians 3 8 team
[1:02:16] it is hot up here though sure enough
[1:02:20] so now listen
[1:02:22] we all as human beings
[1:02:25] we talk about inheritance
[1:02:27] jim just got an inheritance if you mom
[1:02:30] or dad passes away
[1:02:31] you get an inheritance but remember it
[1:02:33] has to be the death of a testator before
[1:02:35] you can can get this
[1:02:37] all right they don't read the will while
[1:02:38] the man or woman is alive
[1:02:40] you got to be passed on that's why when
[1:02:42] jesus christ took took that cup and he
[1:02:44] said this is a cup in the new testament
[1:02:46] in my blood because that testator had to
[1:02:49] die to create a new testament because
[1:02:51] the old testament was by the law
[1:02:54] the inheritance of the law it is no more
[1:02:57] promise there wasn't a promise in the
[1:02:59] old testament
[1:03:05] read hebrews 11
[1:03:07] where it says day without us will not be
[1:03:09] made perfect but read the scripture
[1:03:10] before that not having the promise great
[1:03:13] men david it names them all abraham um
[1:03:16] moses
[1:03:18] noah all these great men
[1:03:20] are
[1:03:21] able
[1:03:23] it says not having the promise
[1:03:26] what is the promise god listen when god
[1:03:29] said in genesis 3 15 he started in
[1:03:31] genesis 1 and said i'll make man in my
[1:03:33] own image well that got marred as the
[1:03:35] prophet said there's no way that could
[1:03:36] be
[1:03:38] birthed
[1:03:39] but god said in genesis 3 15 he said
[1:03:42] i'll put it back together
[1:03:44] i'll put enmity or division between you
[1:03:46] and me but i'm going to come back as
[1:03:48] human being and i'm going to put it
[1:03:49] right back together again
[1:03:51] under a new testament because the old
[1:03:53] testament only puts you what condemned
[1:03:56] you
[1:03:59] but god gave it to abraham by promise in
[1:04:01] other words when you start in genesis 12
[1:04:02] or 13 he says i will i will abraham i
[1:04:06] will i will give you this i will do that
[1:04:09] i am i am i am
[1:04:14] well wherefore then serve at the law it
[1:04:16] was added because of transgressions
[1:04:19] till the seed could come to whom the
[1:04:21] promise was made
[1:04:24] us us
[1:04:27] and it was ordained by angels in the
[1:04:29] hand of a mediator who's our mediator
[1:04:31] jesus christ
[1:04:33] but he wasn't that mediator in the old
[1:04:35] testament
[1:04:37] hello
[1:04:39] it was the father above them looking
[1:04:40] down through the blood it was the only
[1:04:42] reason they didn't die it's because
[1:04:44] there was a substitute there
[1:04:47] bulls and goats
[1:04:49] but when christ came let's go on all the
[1:04:51] way up scroll down
[1:04:56] now a mediator is not a mediator of one
[1:04:58] but god
[1:05:00] levi you're not driving a car okay
[1:05:02] there you go
[1:05:04] listen i appreciate these brothers doing
[1:05:05] that i'm playing with them but they know
[1:05:07] i appreciate them i appreciate brother
[1:05:08] joe and brother anderson and them
[1:05:10] training them so that they don't have to
[1:05:12] be in there the whole time they can come
[1:05:13] out here and sit and enjoy the service
[1:05:14] y'all don't understand what goes on back
[1:05:16] there in that room
[1:05:17] it takes up a lot of their time a lot of
[1:05:19] their mental time
[1:05:20] especially if something goes wrong and
[1:05:22] and 15 people start calling on the phone
[1:05:24] you don't hear it but they hear it back
[1:05:25] there they get hey man that's out i
[1:05:27] can't see nothing i can't hear nothing
[1:05:30] but thank god they're they're training a
[1:05:32] lot of people in this room
[1:05:34] to be back there
[1:05:36] and to do the work
[1:05:38] so that some of our brothers can rotate
[1:05:40] and sit out here and and enjoy the
[1:05:42] service
[1:05:43] now mediator is not immediate everyone
[1:05:45] but god is one is the law then against
[1:05:47] the promise of god so now look it's the
[1:05:49] law against god no
[1:05:52] the law was given because of
[1:05:53] transgression the bible tells us that
[1:05:55] jesus came under the law
[1:06:00] and not he couldn't do away with the old
[1:06:02] testament
[1:06:04] but he made it where we could live it
[1:06:07] he gave us grace
[1:06:09] to where we can live the ten
[1:06:10] commandments
[1:06:11] to what we can understand what isaiah
[1:06:13] was saying what uh
[1:06:15] joshua and all these different ones were
[1:06:16] talking about is the law then against
[1:06:18] the promise of god god forbid
[1:06:20] for if there had been a law given which
[1:06:22] could have given life
[1:06:24] barely righteousness would have been by
[1:06:25] the law in other words if there would
[1:06:26] have been a mediator
[1:06:29] come in the old testament and give his
[1:06:32] life
[1:06:33] instead of giving
[1:06:35] animal life
[1:06:37] we wouldn't have needed it
[1:06:39] righteousness would have been by the law
[1:06:41] but you can't get righteousness out of
[1:06:42] the law
[1:06:43] but the scripture have concluded
[1:06:46] i like paul's writings
[1:06:48] all understand
[1:06:50] he just threw it out there
[1:06:53] all of you
[1:06:56] and then if he left it right there
[1:06:59] we're all in trouble
[1:07:00] but he didn't watch that the promise by
[1:07:03] faith of jesus christ might be given to
[1:07:06] them that believe thank god
[1:07:08] that's me and you that's right now
[1:07:09] that's today
[1:07:11] but before faith came we were kept under
[1:07:13] the law listen when you were born you
[1:07:15] were born under the law
[1:07:19] because jesus didn't come to bring us a
[1:07:21] new way to get born by sex
[1:07:26] that's plain but he didn't
[1:07:30] you must be born
[1:07:32] again
[1:07:35] and poor nicodemus
[1:07:37] bless his heart
[1:07:38] if i got to go back and get in my mama's
[1:07:40] womb
[1:07:42] have i gotta go back get in my mama's
[1:07:43] womb
[1:07:44] carnal
[1:07:45] jesus said you can't understand because
[1:07:47] this is coming from above
[1:07:51] but before faith came we were kept under
[1:07:53] the law shut up unto the faith which
[1:07:57] should afterwards be revealed
[1:08:00] that's why brother brown many many times
[1:08:01] he said faith is a revelation
[1:08:04] your new birth is what a revelation a
[1:08:06] personal revelation between you and
[1:08:08] jesus christ not between you and so and
[1:08:10] so in jesus christ no you and jesus
[1:08:12] christ
[1:08:13] there is no mediator as the catholic
[1:08:15] church see they insert mediators
[1:08:18] men human men that come in and and women
[1:08:21] sometimes if you're a saint they throw
[1:08:23] them in between that you've got to
[1:08:24] mediate to them and they mediate to this
[1:08:26] one and this mediates the god
[1:08:28] no
[1:08:28] there's one mediator
[1:08:30] the man christ jesus
[1:08:32] wherefore the law was our schoolmaster
[1:08:34] to bring us to christ there's your
[1:08:36] schoolmaster that we might be justified
[1:08:39] by faith but after that faith has come
[1:08:41] in other words after you're born again
[1:08:43] you're not under school master
[1:08:46] bible
[1:08:49] what did the school master do
[1:08:51] told you you were lost
[1:08:55] but before faith came
[1:08:57] here's faith here's your new birth
[1:08:59] before faith your common life was what
[1:09:01] under the law shut up in faith which
[1:09:03] shall be after be revealed wherefore the
[1:09:05] law with our schoolmaster to bring us to
[1:09:07] christ
[1:09:10] to this point
[1:09:12] right here
[1:09:14] that we might be justified by faith but
[1:09:16] after faith has come we don't need the
[1:09:18] schoolmaster
[1:09:20] it listen you say oh now what do away
[1:09:22] with the schoolmaster no the
[1:09:23] schoolmaster what he's told you is now
[1:09:26] inside of you
[1:09:29] it's imprinted in you and if you're born
[1:09:31] again you can't have that taken away
[1:09:33] from you
[1:09:36] so it doesn't that the school master we
[1:09:37] have to do away with it
[1:09:41] paul when he says leaving the principles
[1:09:42] of doctrine of christ the baptism he
[1:09:44] don't mean to leave it not ever do it
[1:09:46] again
[1:09:47] he means that should be already in you
[1:09:49] so much it should be part of your
[1:09:51] dna
[1:09:53] christian dna
[1:09:55] amen that you don't have to fight over
[1:09:57] that anymore
[1:10:00] the schoolmaster brought you to a place
[1:10:01] to where you don't fight over these old
[1:10:03] things anymore
[1:10:05] now you got to fight still
[1:10:08] so that's why it gives you a tutor and a
[1:10:09] governor
[1:10:11] as you continue on with your schooling
[1:10:14] wherefore the law was our school master
[1:10:15] to bring us to christ that we might be
[1:10:16] justified by faith but after that faith
[1:10:19] has come we are no longer under a
[1:10:20] schoolmaster
[1:10:21] for you are all the children of god by
[1:10:23] faith in christ jesus in other words
[1:10:24] when we read romans 8 we'll come back to
[1:10:26] this romans 8 said you received the
[1:10:28] spirit of adoption spirit of adoption
[1:10:32] in the line of adoption
[1:10:35] because listen folks
[1:10:38] the prodigal son was the son
[1:10:42] you all understand that
[1:10:44] the prodigal son was a son he didn't
[1:10:46] become a son when he came back
[1:10:50] now in the mind of god
[1:10:53] you always were that's where the people
[1:10:54] get all this mixed up in the mind of god
[1:10:56] you always were that son
[1:10:58] remember brother brown said you're not
[1:10:59] become sons by the birth
[1:11:01] but that's in god's mind folks i know i
[1:11:03] was lost
[1:11:05] i know i didn't have god nowhere in my
[1:11:07] life
[1:11:09] because he will not live an unclean
[1:11:10] vessel he won't even touch uncleanness
[1:11:14] but when faith came
[1:11:17] when the real mind of god come to you
[1:11:20] and said i want to birth you if you'll
[1:11:22] just believe me
[1:11:24] take me at my word
[1:11:27] then it will change you change your min
[1:11:30] change your thinking
[1:11:33] for we are all the children of god by
[1:11:35] faith in jesus christ whereas many of
[1:11:36] you that have been baptized into cross
[1:11:38] have put on christ there's neither jew
[1:11:40] nor greek there's neither bond or free
[1:11:42] there's neither male or female why we're
[1:11:44] all one in christ
[1:11:45] heirs and join us if you beat christ
[1:11:47] then you are abraham's seed and heirs
[1:11:49] according to the promise now let's go
[1:11:51] down to the next
[1:11:53] which is this is a continuation
[1:11:56] now i say that the heir as long as he's
[1:11:58] a child difference nothing from a
[1:11:59] servant though he be lord of all like i
[1:12:02] said before now look at that position
[1:12:05] boy the son the son as soon as he gets
[1:12:07] about
[1:12:08] 16 years old or whatever he says
[1:12:11] you gotta listen to me
[1:12:13] you gotta listen to me
[1:12:15] because i'm the son
[1:12:18] that ain't the right attitude
[1:12:22] if it didn't humble you when god saved
[1:12:24] you you didn't get saved
[1:12:27] if that you let me say that again if you
[1:12:29] didn't get humble
[1:12:32] and thank god for what he did for you
[1:12:34] and that he didn't destroy you in your
[1:12:36] previous life
[1:12:38] that ought to humble you
[1:12:40] not make you proud
[1:12:43] now i say that there as long as he's a
[1:12:45] child different nothing from a servant
[1:12:47] though he be lord of all
[1:12:49] but he's under tutors and governors now
[1:12:51] here we go he's under tutors and
[1:12:52] governors now
[1:12:53] we got a little bit higher we're fixing
[1:12:55] to go to college now
[1:12:57] we got out of high school
[1:12:59] but under tutors and governors until the
[1:13:01] time appointed
[1:13:03] of the father
[1:13:04] what time was that
[1:13:06] now
[1:13:08] now
[1:13:11] until that's when we needed it see that
[1:13:13] in the in the
[1:13:15] six church ages i say seven church ages
[1:13:17] i wasn't going to say that but even in
[1:13:18] seven church ages that's not the time
[1:13:20] appointed to the father for people to
[1:13:22] come to adoption
[1:13:27] everybody received the spirit of
[1:13:28] adoption crying father father
[1:13:31] everybody did
[1:13:32] but only one is going to be what placed
[1:13:36] that's what we're going to get to in
[1:13:37] just a minute placed
[1:13:39] that's the whole deal
[1:13:41] you got to be placed
[1:13:44] right bus
[1:13:48] right direction
[1:13:51] place yourself
[1:13:53] in the right seat
[1:13:55] even so we when we were children were in
[1:13:57] bondage under the elements of the world
[1:13:59] but when the fullness of time was come
[1:14:02] god sent forth his son made of a woman
[1:14:04] made under
[1:14:08] the law
[1:14:10] look to redeem them that were under the
[1:14:12] law
[1:14:14] redeem bring back
[1:14:16] that we might receive the adoption of
[1:14:18] sons and because you are sons
[1:14:22] god has sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:14:23] into your hearts crying of a father or
[1:14:26] father father wherefore they are no more
[1:14:28] a servant but a son and if a son than an
[1:14:31] heir of god through christ as i said
[1:14:33] many times before
[1:14:35] never make yourself special god will do
[1:14:38] that for you
[1:14:40] god will make you special
[1:14:42] i've heard listen we've been in the
[1:14:43] message long enough i've seen people
[1:14:45] come by and they're like
[1:14:47] i wear this special we see like i said
[1:14:49] we have this special seating us when
[1:14:50] we're born
[1:14:53] well now you can call quote brother
[1:14:55] brown hey there's a verbatim quote
[1:14:57] but what's he talking about
[1:15:01] i've always tell him i'll tell you one
[1:15:02] more time
[1:15:04] god's a just god
[1:15:08] judgment is passed on sons and daughters
[1:15:10] too
[1:15:11] but it's not the great judgment
[1:15:12] everybody got that
[1:15:14] but everybody is equal when they're born
[1:15:17] or gods of respect they're persons
[1:15:21] so if adolf hitler walks up to the white
[1:15:23] throne
[1:15:24] he's going to look up and say
[1:15:27] well if you put something different in
[1:15:28] them than you put in me you can't judge
[1:15:30] me
[1:15:31] [Music]
[1:15:33] but god's going to say no you got it all
[1:15:36] wrong
[1:15:37] i came to you in 1939
[1:15:39] so dave whatever it is he'll tell him
[1:15:41] exactly i tried to get you saved i tried
[1:15:44] to get you to believe in me and you
[1:15:45] wouldn't do it
[1:15:46] he said these people behind me i'll tell
[1:15:48] you what day they got saved
[1:15:51] that's the mind of god folks that's the
[1:15:53] mind of god not what's going on down
[1:15:55] here on the earth
[1:15:57] in the mind of god listen in the mind of
[1:15:59] god this thing's finished in the mind of
[1:16:00] god you didn't you didn't have a regular
[1:16:03] life
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:08] brother brown said if god
[1:16:10] saw your sin
[1:16:13] he'd have to destroy you didn't know
[1:16:14] what he said
[1:16:16] if he would have saw adam and eve sin he
[1:16:19] would have had to kill them both we
[1:16:20] always talk about him throwing evil way
[1:16:23] he'd have thrown out him away too
[1:16:26] but remember there was a lamb
[1:16:29] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:16:31] that was grace that was a covering for
[1:16:34] them
[1:16:35] were heirs of god through christ all
[1:16:36] right let's go to the next i want to
[1:16:37] read these quotes to you and then we're
[1:16:38] finished
[1:16:40] [Music]
[1:16:42] and i was going to read these quotes
[1:16:43] anyway this is not coming from anything
[1:16:45] that i said before
[1:16:47] but listen
[1:16:51] when i read these i want you to think
[1:16:52] about something
[1:16:56] we're talking about placing
[1:16:59] we're talking about a position
[1:17:02] i'm not calling no names
[1:17:05] no churches okay everybody understand
[1:17:08] what i'm saying
[1:17:09] i'm just going to tell you what brother
[1:17:10] brown said we needed
[1:17:14] i remember staying a year and six months
[1:17:16] in this book of revelations in the
[1:17:17] tabernacle this is on the seven church
[1:17:19] ages 1954 this is before he preached him
[1:17:22] in 60.
[1:17:23] that's what i like in teaching i just
[1:17:25] love teaching oh my i think it's
[1:17:27] wonderful it gives the basis and settles
[1:17:31] the church
[1:17:34] now who in the world wouldn't want to be
[1:17:35] a settled
[1:17:37] a settled church
[1:17:39] in preaching now there are some people
[1:17:41] that are preachers
[1:17:43] they can pick up the word with
[1:17:44] inspiration
[1:17:52] levi
[1:17:53] help me please thank you
[1:17:57] they can pick up the word with
[1:17:58] inspiration watch
[1:18:01] and sway it out there in places
[1:18:04] that's watering the seed
[1:18:06] that the teacher has taught
[1:18:11] i'm re yep i believe brother brown was a
[1:18:13] prophet
[1:18:15] okay then we're going to believe what he
[1:18:16] said
[1:18:17] that's watering the seed that the
[1:18:19] teacher has taught see now you've got to
[1:18:21] put some seed in first
[1:18:24] then water it
[1:18:25] and the watering comes from the
[1:18:27] preaching of the word
[1:18:28] there's a great vast difference between
[1:18:31] a teacher and a preacher
[1:18:36] see it's two different gifts of the
[1:18:38] spirit all together two different gifts
[1:18:40] and i humbly say this but i haven't a
[1:18:42] gift of either
[1:18:43] that's humble
[1:18:45] that's a prophet of god standing
[1:18:47] saying he doesn't even have both no he
[1:18:49] had all of them
[1:18:51] but how humble was he all right let's go
[1:18:53] to adoption listen
[1:18:56] just a few more we'll be finished
[1:18:58] adoption 1960.
[1:19:00] bible teaching is a little usually a
[1:19:02] little treacherous
[1:19:03] although you know kind of walking on
[1:19:05] thin ice we call it
[1:19:07] but we just feel that maybe at this
[1:19:08] point and this time it might be good
[1:19:10] kind of to bring the church to what i
[1:19:12] think is a complete understanding and
[1:19:14] watch his next word positionally
[1:19:18] positionally of what we are in jesus
[1:19:20] christ and sometimes i think that
[1:19:21] preaching is a wonderful thing
[1:19:23] but i believe sometimes brother bealer
[1:19:25] that teaching goes beyond that it kind
[1:19:27] of especially to the church
[1:19:31] everybody still believe brother brown
[1:19:33] was a prophet
[1:19:34] believe what he said okay some of you
[1:19:35] don't
[1:19:38] that's your problem
[1:19:40] but teaching places a man positionally
[1:19:43] what he is
[1:19:45] and we can never rightly be able to have
[1:19:48] faith until positionally we know what we
[1:19:51] are
[1:19:53] never rightly have faith
[1:19:56] everybody believe brother brown was a
[1:19:57] prophet okay
[1:19:59] we can never rightly be able to have
[1:20:01] faith until positionally we know
[1:20:03] know
[1:20:04] what we are
[1:20:06] everybody got that
[1:20:08] now let's read these next few right here
[1:20:10] there's one long one and i'll read it
[1:20:11] but
[1:20:12] brother brown explains it way better
[1:20:14] than i do so brother brown look
[1:20:16] what we're talking about this morning a
[1:20:18] couple weeks ago now what is adoption
[1:20:21] let's get this now i don't know whether
[1:20:23] i won't have time to get through this
[1:20:24] but i'll hit it then if there's a
[1:20:26] question you can ask me a little later
[1:20:27] on something to message sometime your
[1:20:29] adoption is not your birth
[1:20:34] scroll on up um
[1:20:36] so that they can see it your adoption is
[1:20:38] not your birth
[1:20:41] two different things but you can't have
[1:20:42] one without the other but you can have a
[1:20:44] new birth without being adopted but you
[1:20:45] can receive the spirit of adoption when
[1:20:47] you're born again
[1:20:49] so what is it folks it's what we do with
[1:20:51] it
[1:20:53] god's not going to pull you up that
[1:20:54] statue of perfect man
[1:20:56] if you don't want to go
[1:20:58] the holy ghost is a gentleman
[1:21:00] if you want to stay right here and say
[1:21:02] well just well that's what the
[1:21:03] pentecostals did and i'm saying this
[1:21:05] with
[1:21:06] extreme caution and extreme
[1:21:09] um
[1:21:10] in my heart
[1:21:12] when you watch most people in this
[1:21:14] message that's what they got
[1:21:17] they got the holy ghost
[1:21:18] and they shout the house down
[1:21:21] but no teaching
[1:21:28] he said that's where pentecost failed
[1:21:30] and a lot of people are just
[1:21:31] pentecostals and moving over into the
[1:21:32] message
[1:21:33] nothing wrong with that folks they're
[1:21:35] going to be there just like me and you
[1:21:36] but there's going to have to be a place
[1:21:37] that somebody is going to have to bring
[1:21:39] that headstone back
[1:21:41] not be a baby not be a pentecostal baby
[1:21:44] and you can't be a babe you can't stay a
[1:21:46] baby
[1:21:47] and have these virtues working in your
[1:21:48] life
[1:21:51] your adoption is not your birth
[1:21:54] and i will do that we'll pull it apart
[1:21:56] because i want to show you the two
[1:21:56] characteristics of each one but your
[1:21:58] adoption is your placing
[1:22:03] i'm the bus driver
[1:22:06] someone has taught me how to drive
[1:22:10] i have my driver's license to drive a
[1:22:12] bus
[1:22:14] so i know that's my position
[1:22:17] someone else raises their hand i know
[1:22:19] i'm the tour guide
[1:22:22] i didn't get my license to drive a bus
[1:22:25] somebody taught me
[1:22:28] how to be a guide
[1:22:33] in other words then you got
[1:22:35] other than that you got 50 people
[1:22:36] sitting on the bus and it's just sitting
[1:22:37] there
[1:22:41] somebody got to step up and drive a
[1:22:42] thing
[1:22:43] somebody got to step up and be the tour
[1:22:44] guide
[1:22:47] when you're born again john 1 17
[1:22:50] i believe when you're born again of the
[1:22:52] spirit you are sons of god
[1:22:55] but look folks we were predestinated
[1:22:57] every age was predestinated we know that
[1:22:59] for a fact
[1:23:01] but what are we predestinated into
[1:23:04] adoption
[1:23:06] according to the scripture we'll read it
[1:23:07] later
[1:23:08] but we were predestinated now here's
[1:23:10] what i'm trying to get you to
[1:23:12] for this sons of the last day
[1:23:16] not luther not wesley
[1:23:18] not pentecost today
[1:23:21] to see we were predestinated to unto
[1:23:24] adoption
[1:23:26] now here we are now this is what hurts
[1:23:28] pentecostal a little bit they say i got
[1:23:31] born again praise the lord god the holy
[1:23:32] ghost brother brown said
[1:23:34] fine
[1:23:36] [Music]
[1:23:38] but yet that ain't what i'm talking
[1:23:39] about see you were predestinated into
[1:23:42] adoption adoption is placing
[1:23:45] a son
[1:23:47] we'll get into that play i want to get
[1:23:48] to the placing part but now let's let's
[1:23:50] read this real quick
[1:23:52] and this is that big old word that
[1:23:53] brother dale can't
[1:23:55] pronounce it's called bar mitzvah
[1:23:58] okay it's it's a jewish tradition
[1:24:02] bar mitzvah bar means
[1:24:04] son of
[1:24:06] remember you are simon barjona
[1:24:09] he knew that barjona that jonah was his
[1:24:11] son
[1:24:12] he was jonas's son simon barjona all
[1:24:15] right so bar mitzvah is son of the
[1:24:18] promise
[1:24:19] son of and mitzvah means promise
[1:24:22] so what they do in in that stage is is
[1:24:25] they take them at 13 or 14 years old
[1:24:27] whenever they're able to pass some tests
[1:24:31] that sound familiar
[1:24:32] whenever they're able to pass some tests
[1:24:35] not fail them
[1:24:36] pass some tests
[1:24:38] when they're able to pass some tests
[1:24:40] the father says okay
[1:24:42] now you can read scripture in the you
[1:24:44] can read the torah because before then
[1:24:46] you couldn't even touch it that thing's
[1:24:47] so sacred
[1:24:50] they don't let kids handle the word
[1:24:52] that's why jesus
[1:24:55] being who he was
[1:24:57] under the law
[1:24:58] he pops up at 13 years old and he's
[1:25:00] reading scripture in the temple
[1:25:03] because he went through his bar mitzvah
[1:25:07] but he's fixing to go through one
[1:25:10] spiritually
[1:25:12] on that mount transfiguration
[1:25:14] he went through a bar mitzvah up there
[1:25:15] and the whole world
[1:25:18] whole world us
[1:25:20] saw it
[1:25:22] so now look when this child was born he
[1:25:24] became a son the very moment
[1:25:26] he was born in the family you get it
[1:25:29] brother brown was trying to get him to
[1:25:30] see it now there was a tutor over this
[1:25:33] boy to educate him and to raise him up
[1:25:36] well he was no more than a servant said
[1:25:38] the galatian letter until he came to an
[1:25:40] age a certain limited time that he was
[1:25:42] set
[1:25:43] and this tutor would always take the
[1:25:45] father's word
[1:25:47] father take the father word your son is
[1:25:50] progressing or whatever it was and now
[1:25:52] that's where i'm not disagreeing my dear
[1:25:54] brother but here to take it from one
[1:25:56] here
[1:25:57] take it as from one who loves you you
[1:25:59] know he's talking to his talking
[1:26:00] pentecost
[1:26:02] because look he said there's where
[1:26:04] pentecost failed to see this
[1:26:08] and if the holy spirit and and don't get
[1:26:11] me wrong i'm i'm trying to
[1:26:13] i've been battling this thing all week
[1:26:16] we're not a special group of people but
[1:26:18] yet we are
[1:26:20] okay
[1:26:21] but let god pronounce that we're special
[1:26:24] not you
[1:26:26] let god toot your horn
[1:26:28] if you become the right son he will
[1:26:30] because you know what he's going to do
[1:26:31] he's going to say here's my son
[1:26:35] now if that boy
[1:26:37] if that boy at about 12 years old
[1:26:42] give me that torah
[1:26:44] walks into the sanctuary where he
[1:26:46] shouldn't be
[1:26:47] at that age picks up the book
[1:26:50] starts reading it no one would listen to
[1:26:53] him
[1:26:54] because he was out of order
[1:26:57] but there's an order to everything when
[1:26:58] the son turned 13 years old and he was a
[1:27:00] good child he studied
[1:27:02] he read he knew how to read
[1:27:05] then the father would take him out and
[1:27:07] say hey i'm placing this son in a
[1:27:09] position
[1:27:11] because he can do things now
[1:27:15] he can read the bible
[1:27:17] he can do part of the things in the now
[1:27:19] he couldn't do everything in the
[1:27:20] sanctuary but he could at least go in
[1:27:21] there now why but if he was not if he
[1:27:24] was a rebellious child
[1:27:26] if he only come to church every once in
[1:27:27] a while
[1:27:33] see if the holy spirit may be not
[1:27:34] willing to give it then
[1:27:36] look when you were born again of the
[1:27:38] holy ghost you said this is it brother
[1:27:40] and that's why he said pentecost is it
[1:27:42] that's what you see in the message
[1:27:44] i'm sorry
[1:27:49] don't get me wrong
[1:27:51] me and you do the same thing
[1:27:53] we like to go to meetings where there's
[1:27:55] a little bit of emotion
[1:27:59] right
[1:28:00] because we're humans and we like to feel
[1:28:02] good
[1:28:04] but i thought i just read where teaching
[1:28:06] places you in the body listen you don't
[1:28:07] know what you're shouting about
[1:28:09] unless you're positionally placed where
[1:28:11] you're supposed to be
[1:28:12] you're just tooting a whistle like
[1:28:13] pentecost did they have these
[1:28:15] pentecostal meetings where you've been
[1:28:17] to meetings before where they're they're
[1:28:18] already amen in the brother before he
[1:28:20] even says a word
[1:28:22] how they gonna understand that
[1:28:23] i told one brother one time i said they
[1:28:25] failed ever let me do that i'd trick
[1:28:26] every one of them i started preaching
[1:28:28] some false doctrine and i'd see what
[1:28:29] they always amended about because they
[1:28:31] just go
[1:28:34] jesus is the third person of trinity
[1:28:43] there's nothing wrong with a pentecostal
[1:28:45] revival
[1:28:47] but i would not want it all the time
[1:28:50] i need some teaching
[1:28:52] because i want to be i want to be
[1:28:54] positionally played listen there's no
[1:28:55] power in pentecost
[1:29:00] pentecost has lived this day
[1:29:03] why is he saying that right there
[1:29:04] there's where pentecost failed
[1:29:08] to see this and if we keep that
[1:29:10] pentecost here
[1:29:12] emotion not the pentecost 2000 years ago
[1:29:16] we failed
[1:29:19] it's why we've been here 60 years we
[1:29:21] failed to see that there's further
[1:29:23] growth
[1:29:25] and somebody needs to teach us that
[1:29:29] look when you were born again of the
[1:29:31] holy ghost you said this is it brother
[1:29:33] it was you was a
[1:29:36] child everybody still brother brown was
[1:29:38] a prophet right everybody okay all right
[1:29:41] you was just as much child as you ever
[1:29:44] could be you were born in the family but
[1:29:46] yet the tudor which is the holy ghost
[1:29:48] has watched over the church as it's been
[1:29:51] maturity all right keep going
[1:29:53] now this tutor in the natural went to
[1:29:56] the father and said now that boy's not
[1:29:58] going to be very good
[1:30:00] i tried to teach him and he just won't
[1:30:01] listen
[1:30:03] he's got his own head strong way boy
[1:30:05] that hit us all
[1:30:07] and he just won't listen
[1:30:09] he's going to be this
[1:30:11] or he's going to be that
[1:30:13] the father realizes right then that that
[1:30:15] boy cannot take over his domain that
[1:30:17] didn't make him not a son
[1:30:20] god can't give you the holy ghost and
[1:30:22] then take it back
[1:30:23] not an indian giver but he can give you
[1:30:25] the holy ghost and i love what the
[1:30:28] prophet said the prophet said the holy
[1:30:30] ghost is a timid person
[1:30:33] a gentleman
[1:30:36] a gentleman
[1:30:38] if you don't want to go do this
[1:30:40] he's not going to make you do it
[1:30:42] if you don't want to go and get some
[1:30:43] more virtue and get some more knowledge
[1:30:45] and get some more
[1:30:46] temperance it's your choice
[1:30:50] the father realizes right then that that
[1:30:52] boy cannot take over his domain that's
[1:30:54] right
[1:30:55] because what would he do
[1:30:57] he'd run it through look the return of
[1:30:59] the prodigal son gives a very beautiful
[1:31:00] picture of it what did he do he went out
[1:31:02] in the world and did what squandered his
[1:31:04] wealth
[1:31:05] right
[1:31:06] see he could not
[1:31:08] what he would do would be mortgage to
[1:31:10] farm or sell it off and drink it up and
[1:31:12] run around now the spiritual sense after
[1:31:14] we were born again in christ we become
[1:31:16] children of god
[1:31:18] but then see god knows best
[1:31:20] now here's what i say reverently
[1:31:22] disagreeing with the latter reign
[1:31:24] brethren you think i'm persecuting
[1:31:28] you think i'm persecuting church
[1:31:30] no my dear brother and neither am i
[1:31:33] everybody has their place but there's
[1:31:35] got to be a place folks where god can
[1:31:37] speak through us
[1:31:39] just like he spoke to his son
[1:31:42] and you can't do that being a baby jesus
[1:31:44] christ was not a baby
[1:31:46] when he was transfigured on that
[1:31:48] mountain he was a 30 year old man
[1:31:51] that had been through all his life now
[1:31:53] this boy after he got a certain age he
[1:31:55] had to be adopted into that same family
[1:31:56] he was born into any minister knows it's
[1:31:58] the placing of a son he had to be
[1:32:00] adopted into the family that he was born
[1:32:02] into could you imagine that but that's
[1:32:04] the old testament teaching paul's
[1:32:06] referring to here in ephesians the
[1:32:08] church of ephesus now the thing of it is
[1:32:10] brother we have tried to make
[1:32:13] each one here and each one this and each
[1:32:14] one laying on of hands and separating or
[1:32:16] getting setting apart
[1:32:19] we've made that
[1:32:21] but god has to do that the only one can
[1:32:24] do it
[1:32:25] now when the father became aware that
[1:32:27] this boy was not worthy
[1:32:30] he never disowned him
[1:32:32] are you with me just a few minutes
[1:32:35] he never disowned him
[1:32:38] he was still his boy
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:42] but he couldn't put confidence in him
[1:32:48] he was too carried away
[1:32:51] about all kinds of winds of doctrine
[1:32:57] everybody believe brother brown was a
[1:32:58] prophet okay believe what he said okay
[1:33:00] i'm not being redundant like that i'm
[1:33:02] just going to make sure that you
[1:33:03] understand that this is what the prophet
[1:33:04] god's saying i'm not making this up
[1:33:07] that's what the scripture says be not
[1:33:08] carried about by every wind of doctrine
[1:33:10] be stable
[1:33:12] always abounding in the work of the lord
[1:33:13] for so much as you know your works is
[1:33:15] not in vain quickly wish we could stay
[1:33:17] on that a while but notice let's get on
[1:33:19] this is the long quote but finish in a
[1:33:20] minute
[1:33:21] this father then the day come when this
[1:33:23] boy maybe he'd been all right
[1:33:26] and he was a worthy man
[1:33:27] he listened to the father he took
[1:33:29] instructions hello take instructions
[1:33:31] from your daddy
[1:33:33] he listened to instructions
[1:33:34] he was a good boy
[1:33:36] then the father
[1:33:38] the son didn't just jump up and say i'm
[1:33:41] ready to be adopted daddy
[1:33:43] take me out there bless god i can do it
[1:33:46] you'll fail
[1:33:48] but if the father ever takes you out
[1:33:50] there
[1:33:52] he took instructions the father taking
[1:33:54] him out to a public street
[1:33:56] put special clothes on him
[1:33:59] and then the father what clothes is it
[1:34:02] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:34:03] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:34:06] charity
[1:34:07] then the father had a ceremony and
[1:34:09] adopted this son into the family paul's
[1:34:11] saying here having predestinated us into
[1:34:13] the adoption seat unto the adoption
[1:34:16] moses was a pre-figure of it and when
[1:34:18] this son after he came out there he was
[1:34:20] given no longer was he just a servant
[1:34:22] under a tutor he was the boss
[1:34:26] he was the boss
[1:34:29] i hope that soaks
[1:34:30] real deep
[1:34:34] he was the boss but what kind of boss
[1:34:35] was he did he rule with a rod of iron
[1:34:39] or did he rule with wisdom
[1:34:41] did he rule with patience virtue
[1:34:44] knowledge temperance godliness brotherly
[1:34:47] kindness
[1:34:49] that makes you a real son
[1:34:52] it's when these virtues can be lived in
[1:34:53] your life and the world can see it
[1:34:56] that quote before that the world
[1:34:59] god just takes him out and says look
[1:35:01] he took william branham out there in
[1:35:02] arizona
[1:35:04] may i
[1:35:06] may i go there
[1:35:09] we believe brother brown was adopted
[1:35:10] don't we that's the only reason he could
[1:35:11] preach the sales because it wasn't
[1:35:13] brother around preaching the seals it
[1:35:14] was god preaching them
[1:35:18] amen
[1:35:19] took him out there and showed the whole
[1:35:21] world
[1:35:23] if y'all never seen that um
[1:35:25] brother joe i think he put it on our
[1:35:26] website where that brother um can't
[1:35:29] remember remember his last name up in uh
[1:35:31] at brother luke gibson's church that
[1:35:33] scientifically proved
[1:35:35] beyond a shadow of a doubt that cloud
[1:35:36] could not be man-made
[1:35:39] you could not realize how many hundreds
[1:35:42] of millions of gallons of water that a
[1:35:45] vapor from a
[1:35:46] rocket
[1:35:48] would have to produce to make a cloud 26
[1:35:50] miles
[1:35:52] and 30 something miles high every 26
[1:35:54] miles high 30 something miles long how
[1:35:56] many millions and hundreds of millions
[1:35:58] of gallons of water vapor because that's
[1:36:00] what that is the cloud is water vapor
[1:36:02] and he proves it scientifically there's
[1:36:04] no way a rocket made it
[1:36:07] it'd be like us trying to prove that we
[1:36:09] blew up
[1:36:10] that we blew up the state capitol with a
[1:36:12] firecracker
[1:36:15] humanly impossible
[1:36:19] but god
[1:36:21] placed his son
[1:36:24] and said here you him
[1:36:26] this was the second part of his message
[1:36:28] people
[1:36:29] not the first part not in the years of
[1:36:31] preparation what he's trying to get
[1:36:33] pentecost to get out of pentecost
[1:36:36] hello trying to get him out
[1:36:39] then he wanted to place us then he began
[1:36:42] to preach his message
[1:36:44] then he began to preach the seals
[1:36:45] because still the seals places you
[1:36:51] what else does
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:55] the seals places you in the body tells
[1:36:57] you who you are
[1:36:59] what you're doing here
[1:37:01] and where you're going
[1:37:03] that which was which is and is to come
[1:37:06] brother brown said that's what the seal
[1:37:07] showed still shows what was what is and
[1:37:10] what is to come
[1:37:12] amen
[1:37:13] you love the lord
[1:37:15] listen
[1:37:20] just like everything in the world
[1:37:21] musicians come
[1:37:23] it's not for everybody
[1:37:27] [Music]
[1:37:28] it's not for everybody
[1:37:32] but i want you to say it's for you
[1:37:36] i want you to decide it's for you
[1:37:39] because you know what i believe that's
[1:37:40] what a teacher does a teacher simplifies
[1:37:46] hello somebody yeah
[1:37:48] anna my sister simplifies it so a
[1:37:52] kindergartener can understand
[1:37:54] but see that but see though wait a
[1:37:56] minute you got

[1:45:55] you know that's another thing we i was
[1:45:57] just reading a quote
[1:45:59] well brother brown
[1:46:01] talking about it he said altar calls
[1:46:04] would never in the bible
[1:46:08] he said that was some of that was
[1:46:10] prostrating before an idol
[1:46:12] you bow down get down before an idol
[1:46:15] but we still we're okay for you to come
[1:46:17] up here but the gentile way never was
[1:46:19] that
[1:46:20] the gentile way was you just say it i
[1:46:23] believe who's talking and it'll come to
[1:46:25] pass
[1:46:26] that's what god's looking for
[1:46:28] he's looking for a bride that'll take
[1:46:30] him by his word always by his word and
[1:46:32] not have to have a feeling or any motion
[1:46:34] or even touching
[1:46:37] i'm just telling you brother brown said
[1:46:39] altar calls
[1:46:40] we're not even in the bible
[1:46:43] prayer lines are not in the bible
[1:46:45] [Music]
[1:46:50] the centurion said
[1:46:53] i have authority
[1:46:56] position
[1:46:58] i have position
[1:46:59] and i realize that
[1:47:02] he might even know jesus's name he said
[1:47:04] but i realize there's something
[1:47:05] different about you
[1:47:07] and you have a power over
[1:47:09] the demons
[1:47:11] i have a power over a hundred people i
[1:47:12] tell them to go they go i tell them to
[1:47:14] come they come he said i believe you got
[1:47:15] the same what was he telling him he was
[1:47:17] testifying that that man was going
[1:47:19] whatever he spoke
[1:47:21] the devil was going to have to flee from
[1:47:23] it
[1:47:24] now why can't we be the same way that
[1:47:26] centaurian he was a gentile
[1:47:28] he was a a roman that probably
[1:47:31] lord he was a heathen
[1:47:33] but he realized that man had authority
[1:47:35] when we're going to realize that god
[1:47:36] give us that same authority
[1:47:39] to not have to lay hands that we can
[1:47:40] just speak the word and then while the
[1:47:41] word was spoke over there every how many
[1:47:43] miles away that kid was healed
[1:47:48] i love laying on hands that's okay
[1:47:50] prayer lines are okay but
[1:47:52] that's not going to get us out of
[1:47:56] speaking the words going to get us out
[1:47:58] of here
[1:47:59] and speaking it right at the right time
[1:48:01] at the right
