========================================

I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My ears pour out your power and love holy holy holy field like like a few on the platform and all of this we got copied off here the prophet had to say and you'll be able to see it and that's the way it is good to see how much of the Lord just remember now the Lord willing that the weight will be starting this coming Sunday and be preaching for a few weekends on the family and things will come and listen and pay close attention if you miss it make sure you get the tape and listen to it there's another Cloud weisinger will be with us this coming Wednesday the 29th that the preach first remember that remember the fellowship meeting will be here on the third Saturday in March so remember all of these announcements and just pray that the Lord would bless each one okay let's all pray together father before we attempt to read Thy word we ask that you would just help us to understand that you give us Lord the night of your love that we may see you my college Lord we're depending upon one thing and that's you just have your way now with us tonight and lead us let your light shine in each one of our hearts forgive our sins that's those that are not here and when they hear the tape May Lord you be there to give understanding to each one of our hearts and lives forgive our sins be with each one of the sick that's been requested here tonight there's many sicknesses Among Us many things thank you for being with sister Gail taking care of our Lord through the operation that is continue to make all things well in our bodies and just let your light shine Lord of healing virtues to each and every one of us we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen that we've been reading the same scripture for a while but we decided to not to not use the board because I wanted to give all of these so close to us so we won't need it tonight we're going to use the quotes that way everybody can read never reading from second from First Corinthians 11 Verse 18 and 19 and then we're going to first Peter 3. for first of all when you come together in the church I hear that there'd be divisions among you and I partly believe it for there must must be also herishes among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you and let's go over to Peter now and read the scripture in reading the 15th verse and the third chapter of First Peter but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks that you a reason or the hope that is in you with meekness and fear you may be seated over David's blessing to the reading of the word now William probably have a good bit of HEPA here so if you will come up and just get you a bundle of them and take them and pass them all out because that way we'll try our best to get to it tonight if you don't you'll have them and you know be able to read some things um you know the topic will be on tonight now we've been on um taking some of the doctrines of the of the people of the message and trying to cover some things and then as we read during the skipper that we give a reason and a hope that is within us and you know trying to to express to you what we believe and uh and why we believe it that away and not to just say well I believe this don't believe that just you know I'm going down the line but you know we we have probably another at least another service or two uh to be able to cover some things but we've covered like two Souls Two Lords Jesus wouldn't God to the River Jordan the seventh under virtues and then went through into the Thunders from there we've covered you know some believe the Holy Ghost is not here like it was on a death Pentecost and some believe that brother Branham was the one that come to John on Patmos and then we covered in that part that we do not believe that brother random was deity because we don't believe it that way believe all born-again believers with a baptism of the Holy Ghost is deity living inside of them but that way we don't worship the god in each one other we worship the god of Glory then we covered uh how that uh we're not looking for another Prophet to come because we believe that the prophet of God brought the message unto us and the next major prophet to come on the scene in the world is supposed to be to the two witnesses going to Israel all right then we got down into the last message that we were covering and talking about how that we do not believe that Adam injected his seed into Eve to save her um but what we believe is that you know that wouldn't what inspired her from being killed it was the point that God himself had already promised and Eve was a part of Adam just the same as as several was a part of Abraham all right trying to get a few things in line there and then we went in to uh Judah and Tamar and covering that because that was one that has a lot of people's use with even things in believing you know if you will put these kind of lay them out on the front where we can keep them from being piled together you know if you will just lay them out and that way somebody can get them for want some like if they hear it on tape they will want these and we'll do it for them Sunday but you know we went through basically all of those things and remember on each one of them I've made this statement that I speak of these things up on the basis of what I've heard uh some of it personally so knowing some of these people that I have spoke about the doctrines and the things and her personally takes and things you know of these but speaking as far as you know just to say you of what I've heard and then I I tell you this way that uh each one of these doctrines there's um you know a lot of different views that goes with each one of the the doctrines that we brought out and everybody doesn't call her the same belief you know because that wouldn't that wouldn't work out see it would uh it would uh it would cabbage down too quick so you've got this person believing this this person believing that but they all hold to a basis of of their thoughts and their Doctrine you know and doing it and I was talking our Sunday about that you know that brother Randall said it wouldn't hard they said about Luther to be able to protest the Catholic Church the hard part was was to hold his head up above all of the fanaticism that followed around where he was at in his message of the people believing he was God believing he was this believe it anybody that ever had to move going it the people run to the wrong thing and try to make the person the wrong thing and all like that but now we're going to speak tonight as we've come down to to bring it in one of the doctrines that you know we want to speak on and this Doctrine has been around ever since we started in the message it was one of the first ones that come into view with us Long Bar in about 68 you know 67. and it was that some people believed that brother Brown was going to come back and put up a tent and go across the country you know and and preach to people and I preached to the to the bride all right and then there is another group as I said this group will go this way and this group will go this way and they'll all even argue with each other about what they believe and now in the past 20 years or so they started the thoughts on that they call it the return Ministry all right and that's that's more of what they're saying now you don't hear much said about the old tent uh Doctrine or style that it's more or less now called a return Ministry now I believe that what the prophet said unto us about uh the tent and the things and divisions that he had I believe that God gave those to him and you know and and I I believe that right but I just don't follow after uh you know some thoughts that people had um some believe literally that then I heard a man personally you know listen to him on a tape that he said that brother random was going to we'd have to go through this little room and brother Brown was going to speak or speak us a glorified body from that little room you know and doing uh he's going to see then that's the way it is and the same ones are the ones that uh you know they supposed to have an airplane that they're built big enough you know and and things to where that he could fly about the country and and do those things and some people make fun of this group and come find out they believe just a little over on the other line of it you know and they'll make fun of this group and that group will make fun of this group and and all like that I don't believe that's right I heard a man speaking one time and I told his other brother I said I'd probably agree more with what he says than I would with you but I said he was out of line because he was not invited to speak he just got up to testify and he just rolled out all of this about the tent that he believed you know he just couldn't hold it he had to let out what he thought and all like that but see I've been around here now for 40 something years and I'm I'm just to the point that I don't want to argue with anybody about it but I want to express to you you know kind of what I believe and and the thoughts of it and I've never really tried to explain it because I don't believe there's no need of trying to explain a vision that a prophet would have I believe it would take God to explain that I believe it would take the profit getting the revelation to explain that I don't think any individual you me or whoever would be would be capable of of trying to imperfect right what is said by a vision to a prophet even visions that you and I would have right see we would need the profit to interpret those Visions or dreams or things you know people say well I had a dream and it was this that and the other one where will it compare with the scripture you know and that way if it won't then uh you know we don't believe that it comes from God it makes it come from somewhere else but I'm just saying that part because a lot of people believe that there are certain things that that brother Branham didn't preach that he will have to come back and and and preach those things to us you know and uh we will try to just read what he said and where these people get all of these talks and ideas and a lot of them say well he told me personally well that's all right uh you know that's that's that's fine for for what you believe the prophet calls you but I I also believe that uh just show you how far people can go there was a certain brother in the message that brother Branham said he died their own if there's one of them at the church start the Tabernacle and his nurse for his wife was a nurse and she said he was dead his eyes were thrown back and everything well see that all went good until brother Brown disappeared you know from the scene and then you know he came for saying he wasn't even dead well I'd rather believe what the prophet had to say about it than for him right but I just think that people you know that they they get into a situations sometimes and and they'll say brother random call me personally what to do and this certain brother he used to say that a lot and you know it was making people lean toward him because in that message we were talking about the seven Thunders and things he was one of those that people believe was going to be one of those Thunders was going to be that man when he preached and so one day I decided because I'm just that way I just you know I like to get down to the great you know just to wear everything stands and asks questions so ask the brother I said well why did Brother round tell you to preach I've heard you say you know he told you to preach you know what did he tell you to preach he said he told me to praise hell and it hot vegetable Gray you know he'd tell any preacher then yeah but see he had everybody thinking that there was something that brought around told him to preach you know some Revelation some thought and I'll just you know I just like to get down there and ask and I just asking that's what he said now he said he's always preach hell in that heart hail fire in it hot that's what he said amen but I you know I've heard a lot about the tent I've heard a lot of people making their opinions and their thoughts and I go back to what exactly I said a moment ago where would it would be any human mortal capable of interpreting a vision or dream of a prophet right it would take his own uh God would have to speak to him right and to do it so we try to figure it out you know in our own cells well we believe this means this and this means that I've heard that the uh the tent Doctrine the thing was of like you're it was inside of you and and that that inner Intervale was what that little room that you know was to uh be there and uh you know your soul and your being and that little room was that is spoken of in the tent Vision that that was the heart of man well you know that's those may be true but still there's somebody trying to interpret yeah what a prophet has to say so I say if I'll speak where the Prophet spoke about it he said if God doesn't come behind and vindicate that what can we believe right right all right and see that away we we just stay with it and go on down the road you know the biggest problem that I have seen among a lot of the Believers of the message is that those who literally believe in return Ministries and and tent Visions uh they also don't believe too much into the revealing of the word and they're just kind of sitting waiting and I think we need to be prepared don't you right and regardless of whether or not brother random is going to come back and speak to us whatever uh we would have to be prepared that's what I would ask the question that one time and you know and my answer was if run around come right here and put up a tent right here you wouldn't know what he's talking about that's right that's just the reason is you don't know what he's already talking and said to us because I'd say something wrote around saying that people would even say well he didn't say that when I just heard that tape the other day and he didn't say that on that page so I got worried that when I was brown I just bring a book and just so okay read it if I had a book but didn't I copy it off the table hand it out because you know and I told him that was the reason I was saying that right I believe we need to get into the message of the hour I don't believe that we need to play around and I've always said that we make light of the um the uh you know Muhammad is there a Doctrine ever what it is you know where's Muhammad but that Muhammad is supposed to raise up you know and and ride around the of the world well there's one thing about it for about 2 000 years now and almost they have been changing that white horse they at least believe it that way they at least change the White Horse every so often and keep them saddled up ready for it to happen because they're believing that much and the brothers that were supposed to fly the airplane they said themselves from the tape that heard that that the claim that they believed right around was speaking of that it would take two years for them to be able to get it back in flying condition well I've always told you that if I believe right around told me to get an airplane and have it ready then that airplane every day would taxi down off there Ryan would have to take it out every day and he'd have to fly it out and test it and he'd come back and if it didn't take but one gallon of gas I'd want it filled right back up you know I'd want to be ready wouldn't you well that's what I'm leaving following the message right I want to study the message to word that if anything happens then I can relate to the message and see what is going on let me see and be ready against that day but you know now there's a lot of things that I said goes with it and everybody doesn't believe all the same thing I give credit to where credit is due and you know and and all like that and they were saying said that like I said if if we'd have been around brother random boy some people were and the way he's done and and that God would just show him everything you know and and and like that brother Banks would say that down or one through the woods there said well anybody that can show you what how many tell you how many fish You're Gonna Catch and show you where they're at you don't be bound to believe him well I guess it would get too close to a lot of people right and looking for that well I'm still I'm to the point that I I haven't wanted to change horses you know what I mean by that and then our human terminologies to somebody listening uh you don't change horses in the middle of the Stream you know you're going to get wet get the buggy or the wagon or what out of the water all right before you change horses don't change them in the middle of the stream it's our old faithful saying is in other words be prepared right right you know be ready against that day as the Bible said as we were reading there to give a reasonable hope that is within us right and it has become around the land today an embarrassing situation in a lot of respect because once you try to introduce somebody to the message they go and the first thing they do is they just go click on their computer and they run in William Branham well when they do they they don't get a good start right right because they're that all of the fanaticism will be brought up first all of the problems and the people what they believe comes up first you know people believe in he's God believing he's this believing he's the son of man believing all kind of things and uh it's kind of like somebody asked brother Carly one time there said does them people up there believe in you know living with their wife his husband and wife he said yesterday sure do well there's a lot of kids around here kind of proves that I guess you could call it that way you know but um my mother-in-law they got out that we just all believed in beating their wives you know and uh you know and so they asked my mother-in-law about it and uh my mother-in-law didn't say very much but when she spoke she was blunt she said I've known Sam a long time and he ain't gonna beat Piggy that was a good you know it was good for her to be that way but now like I say when we get into this let's just read the things and I tried to to remember as much as possible and run off as much as I could do and deal with the things of and I know I missed a lot that is used and what we're trying to do is we'll read about three different times they brought around them's Tales the the what is called the tent Vision or the vision that he had from the Lord and then we will read some things that if we have time tonight if we don't we'll take it up later on we will try to read some things that people think of what the the uh tent Vision means you know and and the reason they believe it that away so now let's just start off you guys you know you got a lot of notes so we're going to have to read a lot and that's reason I didn't choose to put it up on the the bulletin board to be that much reading uh you know so we'll just read these things now the first time that I know of and he mentions it either in this one or the other one that's right after it This was um January the 1st 1956. was the first time he mentions that I can find or what we would be talking about the tent Vision all right now there's a lot goes with this Vision so you'll have to read it and we'll read it in other accounts that he tells us and you'll see some things were added some things where wordings were different sometimes and you know and it goes into giving I believe a better understanding but it's on a message called why are people so tossed about all right now that originally used to be the message that was called inner Veil now not Intervale Intervale was a message preached like um January the 21st of 1956 but this was the old message that used to be titled inner Veil and they title they changed the title if you look in your little book that shows you the the tapes and the of the books and the things you look at you'll see where it was changed they changed it to why are people so tossed about but it's 1956 January the 1st so let's just read a little bit now giving you a background to where he's starting from to save Heavens to bring all of that when we read here about you know I was going to tell them in Arizona don't tell them this that what he had done wrote a random one out and was preaching and he always told the Lord he said if you ever come to the bases that you do not supply the money you know about having to bag for it he fired uh campaign managers because they begged for money and things and he would they would take up only for the meetings and then they would take up a love offering well he would always say he'd say now this love offering not a penny of it will come to me he said I get a salary from the church and back then he told what it was it was a hundred dollars a week so in 56 that wasn't a lot of money and you'll have you there's one thing that you won't find you get any of them to you get anybody to tell you that run around was after money right you know you know we're Oral Roberts had to have millions and millions of dollars to run his his doings and swaggers with like right before his fall he had like 170 million dollars a year coming in you know and brother Brown had a little old trailer sitting up there and volunteer people to send out prayer cards you know clothes sometimes and uh but the Lord told him said now this is your this is your place to preach out to the world but that's what he was doing and he got in a meeting up there and they went fifteen thousand dollars in the hole on a meeting because it was a big campaign in other words he'd be carrying things too and people that went with him and all like that and they went fifteen thousand dollars in the hole and he told the Lord he said I'm going home I'm coming off the field and you'll hear him saying these things as we read along in a minute that he said you know I'll just go back and I'll help brother um soft wouldn't build houses or do houses or do something or try to get an old job back and and everything and so you'll know this is what he was doing because he was coming off the field because the Lord didn't Supply the money now people before he left to come back and already told him and they did the under of what you call it underwriting they underwrote the the the campaign and pay it off in other words but he says later he said I will pay them back for that all right and that's kind of a background now that's when we we're doing it so watch what he's doing he's coming home he's going to tell his family on the way to Jeffersonville what he's going to do and he could never get up enough nerve to do it so watch what he's saying so we'll start reading from page four now why are people so tossed about 1956-101 . so I said I'll tell them when I get to Arizona after I left California I didn't have the nerve so after I said when in Mexico and on and on to them till till told them coming down coming right down here in Indiana when you got right on the home he told him what he's going to do but they they understood it pretty well Billy didn't get it too well he said Daddy I think you're making a mistake my own tired weary upset crying went to bed that night and after the wife not to sleep I went in the room and held down and said dear Jesus I don't know what I'm going to do here I am right back where I started from again I guess I made them failure about two hours for then from then he appeared to me and he showed me a vision of such a panoramic view of people I never seen I was talking to my wife in The Vision now watch him it's all in a vision now now you people that know me know I'm not a fanatic I don't say these things unless they're the truth that's right and I I've seen it then I seen brother Oregon bright standing there and I went up to him now this is in his mission and he said brother Bailey said we're giving out all the prayer cards and everything's ready now for the meeting we got a way to get you in and out I said thank you brother organ Brian and I walked over to some more brilliant and there was another brother preaching I said who's he he said they put him up I said who is they and they just turned or just turned around walked away and the man made dismissed the audience and let them all go and I said oh you shouldn't do that because there is there's no order call and they said another Feller spoke to me and said we done took up the offering I said when is the offering more important than Souls before Christ now that was the background of the vision part starting so at that time the angel of the Lord taken me out and he taken me to a real bright stream of water it was the most beautiful blue water and great fish were swimming around in it he said I'll make you a Fisher and he said Now cast your Allure into the water and when you do pull it slow first time and the next time just give it a little jerk not too hard and the next time set your hook for the catch and I started to throw my line in the water and I pulled and everybody began rejoicing and saying that's wonderful that's wonderful I got all excited and jerked it hard on the next one out I pulled the fish and all out of the water now this is his vision now that you can see and what was it it was a little bitty fish and it just about the size of the lure no matter who's going to interpret all these things and I got my line all tangled up and I was straightening out my line and the man which was talking behind me walked around in front of me dressed in Palestinian clothes and turban on his head he had a white robe he said brother Brown that's it that's it I know I didn't do right I said I jerked you without not to he said don't get your lime tangled up in these kind of times and I said well I'm running either straight as I can now be very careful he said now the first time and remember these first time second time third time keep all this as we read the next accounts and watch what he said now the first time I spoke spoke with you you put your hand out and we'll read in just a minute this Angel come here was the one that always come to him you know all right so the first time I spoke with you you put your hands on the people and told him what was wrong with him and the second cool why when you did you would know the secrets of their hearts and a major Seer before the people but you was always trying to explain it you ought to have done that he said you made a public show showing out of it I said I'm very sorry now you know in his ministry that that's what he done he he would go out and run around when he started in his first Ministry he would take people by the hand and his hand would to somebody that haven't heard these things his hand would change and be pimples on it and different things and and he'd say I see you have cancer you need to say it's on your left lung you couldn't even wear a watch while those things were taking place it would just quit you know because it was a supernatural thing that was transpiring and he would know those things and then he went on later in his ministry didn't know even the secrets of the people's hearts to where he would discern out and tell him you know what was they were even thinking and the things in a reason why just expressing that little point there on the point all right continue on to reading them then he taken me up taking me from there and I seen a great huge tent I never seen such a attempt and it was packed and lined everywhere with people and I walked out to the looked like I was standing above the people looking down where I just made an article and hundreds and hundreds of people were weeping and rejoicing after they had accepted the Lord Jesus as their savior and I looked and then heard a man get up and say call the prayer line and people begin to line up over on this side the left or where I was looking down towards the platforms you know he was looking down to the platform to be on the left now you'll see him once you he'll turn around he explains it they lined all the way up and down the street for a prayer line I noticed to my left which would have been to my right if I was on the platform now that's to where the little room is going to appear and the things are going to happen we'll be on his right side okay a little wooden building and I've seen that light that oh they have the picture of you know that's always in the meeting I've seen that light leave me and go to that building and go in that building and a voice said to me I'll meet you in there that'll be the third pool I said why he said well it won't be a public show like the other and I came to and now at the beginning of this year back to my Tabernacle where I started from see back to the beginning where I started I am very grateful to God for these things and many of you knows that just before leaving on the other Crusade about eight or ten years I think about 10 years since well nine years it has been it was these things were told exactly how they Auditorium Services you remember exactly how that brother Laughlin would live exactly three years and then be taken away that brother wood would build a tabernacle down and this Ward would build a tabernacle down in this position this direction here and all of it just exactly you know what your Old-Timers it happened just that way and so will this foreign Jesus all right so now he told that that's the vision that he saw the vision of him trying to catch some fish and Vine gets all tangled up and the Lord shows him in it this is the first pull you've done this away the second pull you would know the secrets of the heart and he said then it would go to the third pool all right now the Lord Jesus had three pools we know that right see because that's what he done in his last pool was was preaching to the totally lost all right but now I just picked up one year and put it in to to not to try to interpret but to to show you what he was saying because he said he was looking forward to some of the greatest meetings bring for the greatest meetings look at number two on your notes 1962-908 hey paragraph 16 president stage of my ministry as far as I know that every Vision he's ever given me has been fulfilled except the one now this is 1962-908 . except the one that I'm a change in my Ministry to where I'm to pray for people in a little place like a little room under a tent or a big Auditorium or something it looked to me like a tent you remember that two or three years ago most of it was brought to pass I was to go down in Mexico and how it would rain that night and what would take place down there he told me my Ministry of the first pool remember about catching the little bitty fish are missing it second was a small fish then he told me the third floor don't fail he said don't tell people I've always tried to explain what I'm trying to do he let me know not to tell people what you're doing just do what he tells me to do and let it alone so he tried to explain the the working of the hand the stalks and it created in the Pentecostal realm a lot of fanaticism because everybody wanted to have a gift and they could feel it they could see it they could smell it they could they had all kind of doctrines in the Pentecostals that would uh you know trying to copy after what brother Brown was doing but they couldn't cop the after and one time he said I'll show you if you need these we can get it he said at some of these days I'll show you that wasn't even right but it was to expose all of the fanaticism right all right in other words he shouldn't have tried to explain none of it he should have went on the way he was all right now as I said he in this one he just mentions on the room he just mentions things all right now you'll see it as he keeps saying it over and over that he keeps adding things to it not something different but more information would be brought into being so now let's go to another one where he tells the same thing I'm sorry for reading all this but it's necessary you know go to number three on your notes which is being litter the Holy Spirit preached in 1956 219 starting off on e22 and it goes for a long ways all right but I want you to get the difference in one and the other so everybody got it look at the number three on the left side and the big old line goes down means this is continual reading okay so that's why it's on her like that and just then I want you to watch this and listen how it's it is now so you watch the difference then I heard something whipping around where where you know like that always goes every time that we have a healing service that's just what happened that's the way that it always sounded sounded that way in the bush that time when I heard it it's always been that way and I failed it I heard it rather going moving and I looked and here went that real soft light moving away from me and went down and went into that little building you remember the little building that was in the original that he told and there's something different between the light and the angel because he was still there with me and the light had went into the building and this Angel which speak which still speaking behind me which is a big man he said I'll meet you in there so then I said I don't understand why in dark and he's talking about the little room with the part of the vision that we read before he said watch this woman when she come out of there on the outlet stretcher she was pushing the stretcher out of the other side that's why they think he's got to have this to come to be able to fulfilled to see like going through this room and being healed in in the different things she said I and she said the lady asked with the said what happened she said I don't know it just happened she said I've been in this stretcher said I've been down in bed for years and here come the man out packing his crutches and they asked him what what did he didn't know and he was coming to the platform to testify and I said I don't understand that though and once he's always scriptural he said did not our Lord say when thou praise be not like the Hypocrites that like to make a show he said enter into your secret closet and when you've done so close the door then pray to your father which see it in secret and he that seeth in secret shall reward the openly and he said Remember the Name that you were hunting that time that you dreamed about and I said he said I'll meet you in there this time it won't be a public Show and The Vision left now watch it your brother Adam is trying to fulfill these things so he goes wrong to say he's 25. now we got the tent in making they got a tent and we're going to put up a tent all right he said we got the 10 in making and then in there it'll be able to carry a prayer line right on through now you remember I speak this before it comes to past the exceedingly abundantly to fix fixing to take place I can't wait till I get into that place I said my hearts are yearning and burning and these things here that you see now will be amateur to what our Lord is fixing to do now this is still 1956. you just remember that with all your harness and live for him now and be revered and just be yourself just just be mirrors doe or Mr doe and love the Lord and just move on with a true heart before him and love him he will take care of the rest of it you see all right so now he's picked up in this one telling Division and he's more elaborating upon the little room and the things that have been said now we're going to have to read a long lengthy one on what his visions and you'll see that each one will tie together as we go along okay I hope the voice of life I left to the doctor today is about this thyroid condition and she said your blood count is down to normal Amen on your thyroid it was up you know six months yeah man she said we're just going to look at it a while and come back about June and we'll do another sonogram or whatever I could call those things and we'll look at it then said are you having any trouble I said listen I don't want no trouble swallow that's my problem I can swallow it too good I said I'm up 20 pounds I guess you can read it yeah you need to do something about it I said but I can't yes you can but anyhow so you know this she said just go on everything will be okay except we'll check on it later I said I ain't worried about it anyway all right what is Visions 1956 this brought him on over into April of 1956. and he's in Chicago telling this throw him in and slept very well through the night and the next morning about six o'clock we woke up and I was just getting out of the bed she was on the other side I was just rubbing my face like this and I said well I'm going to call the public service company today and ask you if I could how much old job back again you remember I said he was going to come back and go get him a job come back to work and do things and that's it if they don't give me my job Mr wood is a contractor I'll just go with him and he and I'll go out and wreck some buildings or something I got to work because I've got to go to and I got to work because I've got to go to work and so I said this money's got to be met and I'm fifteen thousand dollars in debt and I said then that that then what can I do I've got to pay that back no matter how much they underwrote it I'm going to pay it back that's right so she said you're going to call Mr Mr bar this morning I said yep I'm going to call him and ask him if I can have my job back and if if that job someone's got it now and they can give him a better job I noticed what brought around what I always want to do is give they got a better job you know I said then I'll just I'll go with brother wood and we'll go to building buildings or something another I'll help him so I said if I come off the field of course that's going to bring him off too and he can go back to Contracting and we can go to work see so we just figured things out because he's remember he coming in he's gonna go off the field same thing he's telling then she said well I sure hope you know what you're speaking of Bill and I said well and I looked coming moving from the ceiling I want to just maybe I couldn't expect you to understand it but that's something that when we meet in the face to face with Jesus you will we shall know them you're done something moving I've seen little black-faced children come moving down if you'll notice in one of these he said now some of these things was fulfilled and he went to Mexico now that's in the park he went to Mexico and it was supposed to start because of that in a certain woman supposed to come to the platform certain things just cause all this tied together uh Here Comes something moving I've seen true little dark Face children come moving down pulling a little wagon I said sweetheart Luke come in here I was done gone then she said what you talking about I could hear her but I couldn't answer her and these little children was walking towards me a little kind of long hair and black dark eyes brown face coming walking to me and I I seen them I started moving on towards the children I've seen Mr augenbright my brother just went overseas with me many times seen him standing there looking at me I moved on to him now I could hear my wife walking around in the room I'll see it this way so that you'll understand it it might not be the right words but you'll understand so you'll understand that one dimension I was in I moved out there into another I could hear her walking no more it was gone I seen Mr auger riding he he was his peculiar little way the way he holds his head and economy smiles and he looks at me and he said run around and said we put out cards everywhere and we gotta wait for you to get in and out and everything's ready and I said all right brother all them back which way shall I go he said just just keep on and I walked on and I've had some ministers then I walked a little further and I came into a great panoramic of Fire and all kind of looks like seating for thousands of people and just then I heard someone say the meetings dismissed well I said who dismissed it now remember this was in the other one that we were reading I said who's dismissed it how did they come to be dismissed and I was disgusted and said why is it dismissed what happened it was sprinkling rain and something said to me by this you'll know then I said well I don't and I went in further into the vision and then when it did I was standing with you know a little baby's shoe of about a year old you know I said he's going to explain disease he's explaining the vision but now he's going to instead of speaking of fishing and different things he puts other things in to connect with the fishing picking up some point she'll watch what he gets cooking them in a little baby shoe about a year old you know a little bit of eyelids it's not a booty with a shoe and I had a string in my hand trying to lace this little inch eighth of an inch hole in this eyelet with about a half inch string so you know that was going pretty good just working perfectly trying to push that string through that half inch string through an eighth of an inch on it and I was breaking the threads all over the stream trying to push it through like that it just wouldn't do it and the string was being all broke up on the end so then I heard someone say behind me don't you understand you can't teach babies Supernatural things and I looked around and it was behind me and I recognized that boy she said you're using the wrong end of the string and I look down at the end of the string lying on the floor grab your powder spring and it was laced down to a nice eighth of an inch so it would go through the hole and I said I understand as I reached to pick up the string I was taken again see now he's still in division okay now you mark this down and watch it come to pass I started to reach down I was gone again when I come to I was standing by the side of a beautiful Lake something like your Lake out here in the summertime when it's real pretty and green and there were fishermen all around the lake and they were fishing but they were catching small fishes I looked out in the lake in those great beautiful rainbow trout out there and I said I know this is a vision but I can't understand those trout he said you know I believe right down in my heart I can't but I see it you know I believe right down in my heart I can catch those so I picked up the string but instead of it being a strain it was a fishing pole and just then the one behind me said I'll teach you to fish how to catch those so he took and he said town the Lord and I snapped a little wrong he said now throw away out now listen close way out into the deep and he said when you do now let the Lord sink down fast and he said pull it up pull it slow now that's really Fisherman's technique so he said then when you do now you're feeling some nibbles at it but don't tell nobody what you're doing keep it to yourself I said then when you when you feel it nibble again sit pull it just a little a little bit but not too hard he said then I'll pull it away from the then it'll pull it away from the little fish and when they scattered that'll attract the tension of the big fish and they'll grab it and say that's the way you'll catch it so then when they buy on the third time set your hook for the catch and I said I understand said but keep still don't tell nobody keep stealing I said all right I had to lower my hand and these fishermen turned out to be ministers they all come around saying brother random I know you can catch fish oh of course that made me feel real good so oh yes I'm a fisherman I can catch fish and he said I I said and he said I said now here's the way you do it he said you throw it way out and it went out into the to the deep water and that's it now those little fish are fine Brethren but we want the big ones too and I was I said see when it sinks down I see there is just about where it should be and I see there's seat Bears see that there are them little fish that's now when it sits again I give it a big great big jerk and when I did I pulled a holder around in the water and what it is I caught a fish but I wonder how he ever got the lure in his mouth those look like the skin was stretched over the lure about the size of the Lord I thought oh my just then the one who's been talking behind me stepped around in front of me it was him the angel of the Lord he had his hands folded he looked at me and said just what I told you not to do that's right he said you see the first pool when you used to put your hands on the people now he's interpreting his own vision right right before he was telling you what he saw now he's interpreting it right so he's the only one who can do it he said you see the first pool is when you put your hands on the people and tell them what was your truth said the second poll was when you know the secrets of the heart like I told you instead of you keeping that to yourself you tried to explain all about it and tell the people when you did said you didn't know nothing about it yourself and how could you explain it and you caused a big bunch of carnal in impersonations to rise up and you see what you've done and I said Lord I'm sorry and I said oh I'm sure I'm so sorry I don't know what to do now you know what I'm saying I want to go that's what he done he caused people to raise up and they said well we feel it we see it we smell it we it caused Pentecostal so that was the babies he was talking about on the other right right and I was pulling the line like that and I was trying to straighten my line out and he looked at me said don't get your line tangled up in these kind of times and I thought maybe he's going to give me another try and I would I said I'm sure I'll sure be careful and was winding up winding my line in and seeing it taken up all right and then when he said just then I felt myself go higher way up and when I was sat down there was the knee and there I was beneath and standing up above a great tent explain that one now I never seen such a team and I just made an article it seem like down at the order and when I was down there I looked and there was hundreds of people standing around in your order around the order weeping because they had accepted the Lord Jesus and they were just weeping out loud and I said oh that's more like it like that and a real kind gentleman walked up to the platform and said well brother Brown's resting for a few moments he said we'll call it a prayer line and I said everyone with Fair Claws and see it everyone with their clothes beginning with a certain number stand over on to the right well I noticed the prayer line it seemed like it went all around the tent and out and down the street shut your prayer line and left over which was then to my left and there it would be to my right if I was standing on the platform would be that way there's a piece of canvas stretched there and eating bit and in b b behind this canvas was a little square building about 12 foot across and 20 feet long something like that well I stood and looked at that there was a lady there taking her name and things on a paper and there was someone coming got her and pushed her through the next next man come true with his crutches remember it was on the other one but now he's more in detail I see them go through that little building on the outside the lady come out screaming to the top of her voice pushes voice pushing the stretcher and then there was another lady on the other side looked like kind of a dark haired woman and she said what happened she said I just don't know she said I couldn't tell you what happened she said I've been paralyzed for 20 years and look I feel like it like I I never was sick just then out come the man leaping and jumping with his crutches in his hand and I looked at that just end or something notice close there's a difference between the angel of the Lord and that light because I heard something of moving as it does when it comes here at the platform at night kind of like a little bit around and makes the sound of who we you know like a fire whipping around licking Blaze and it left me and went right down over the top of that audience and went and stood over the top of that little building and then settle down on the top of it and then when it did this one that was standing by me behind me The Voice same voice the Angel's voice he said I'll meet you in there this is that it's the third pool but nobody will know nothing about it I said well I don't understand why in dark one there he said it'll not be a public show this time and I said I don't understand going to that closet like that he said it is not written by our Lord when I pray us be not not like the Hypocrites who like to be heard before men but enter into the secret closet and pray to the father who see it in secret and he who saith in Secrets shall reward thee openly it's perfectly because of scripture every time and I said I understand the equipment to this place and set me down in this room where I was at and he told me what to do for the third time Christian friends that when I leave this world that'll still be in my bosom when I but you mark my word what's going to take place when that all right and he gets on to that that's three times explain him explaining it and each time he goes a little more into detail a little more detail is involved now you say you can interpret that well how can you interpret what he was he had trouble with it right he didn't understand we've read that two or three times he didn't understand but he brought it they got a 10. and then we're going to do some things you know and all of that because he was a human being all right and then it's doing that then he tells you what he's expecting to do you know to try to fulfill these things right and enjoy what it will will do you know and what can take place all right now here are some of the things that people say the reason they believe brother Brown has got to do this because listen to what he said here on on the message bombing Gilead which would be number five on your notes 59 11 24 San Jose California but after the knowing this that the Lord has spoke some time ago about uh I suppose about three or four years ago my wife is the president I would be able to know yesterday we have it wrote down now I've seen a vision of a large tent or or something that we're anticipating someday having and where we could come into a place and stay a long time we can get the ministers and so forth together where the converts can all have the homes to go to and shift our meetings around where they'll not interfere with the regular Services of the churches maybe be off on Wednesday night and Sunday have a Sunday afternoon instead of Sunday night somewhere it won't interfere with the rest of the religious service and you're in a time that there's no Revival around close could stay and we could have teaching in the morning like ministerial classes and so forth in the afternoon to teach the sick how to hold or heal it hold their healing when they receive it and such as that I'm on my way home immediately after this meeting here for that very same purpose at my Tabernacle then in division I saw a little building sitting in the corner and this light was near me it went and stood over that building the voice said I'll meet you in there I don't know I've just wondered so after that happening last week or week before it now down at Duke Hall Indiana with that mirrors right if it was if it just couldn't happen again in the church out here while this meeting is going on I just I would just love to see it and I know it would inspire you and you know he's talking about explaining about a healing of a lady but see he was expecting to do those things he was expecting to give a 10. and put it up yeah you know and in his life he was looking for those things well I'm sure you and I would do that if we were in his place of trying to do you know and all but now take that and say well this is what now people are saying well there's there's tapes and there's things to explain on there I want to see them if there's something to explain all of these things man you know I've searched and I've tried I've got a decent memory uh I think and I tried to use the computer on every form to be able to pick up these things and and if you can find me something any different than what I read I was just reading to you the the vision that he had and then he would next time he would tell it he'd tell it a little more next time he'd tell a little more it would keep tying together and he would tell you about the first pool the fishing and he called that the first pull all right and he tells you the first pull was feeling the people is hand swelling up and the things was happening and all that what he could tell the diseases and what was taking place and then he was talking about the second pull as the fishing jerking the line and doing the things you know and the second pool was to come to know the very secrets of the heart of the people Well that took place in his ministry anybody would have to agree to that those things took place now then the point is the discussion is about what people are trying to say they won't discuss the first and second and they don't deal with that they want to go to the thing that he called the third pool all right and as he was calling it the third pool and then he said nobody will ever know this yep it would be a secret to him did you try to explain the first and second he said you can't explain this well then he was looking for those things now let's jump over and I hope I got these in the right order because I noticed I'm gonna have to tell you what page paragraph numbers to make sure you stay right but I think I I printed them different uh look at number six of your notes but look at it as paragraph 285 now you might have to flip your notes over or pick up another one look at paragraph 285 so they got these back there I want to go run all these off anybody want to do it I ran off about 20 something pages on to use 10 or 12. time to get it for you and I flipped them over okay so we'll find it and read it we want to start on paragraph 285. all right it's called the seventh seal 1963 324 the evening service all right you'll see a big old line up and down with a six on the side of it everybody got it now don't go to the six on the other one that will have a six and a seven at the bottom don't go to that go to the one that's got the six in the big long line so we're going to stay together okay all right paragraph 285. and I had my hands out and all at once something hit my hand I don't know but I can't say did I go to sleep I don't know did it go into the tramps I don't know what's the division I can't tell you only thing I can say is that I just the same thing like them Angels was and it struck my hand and I looked and it was a sword and it had pearl handles real pretty and had a guard over it with gold and a blade looked like something like a chrome like silver on it was real shiny and show feather is sharp oh my God isn't that the prettiest thing just step my hand and I thought that's awful pretty but I said hey I've always pray for them things a sword and I thought what will I do with that just in a voice shook right down through the air that brought to rocks and said it's the sword of the king and when I come out of it the sword of the king and if I see it a sword of aching but it said it now if it said a sort of aching but it said the sort of thinking and there's only one D king that's God and he has one sword that's his word which I live by so help me God's standing over his I will eat this there with this holy word laying here it's the word so now he's he's got the sword in the hand now he's going to tell you what that is he goes on to the next paragraph 289 which is a continuation of reading no oh what a day we're living in what a great thing see the mystery in secret the third standing there when this left me something just shook just come to me and said Don't Fear now I didn't hear the voice like on the inside of me I didn't hear no voice like on the inside of me smoke I have to just tell you the truth it's exactly what happened something he hadn't said no fear this is that third pool now on the third pool of the visions that I read to you it was the 10th we read three of them the short was the ten that's right now he says this is that third pool which was a sword in his hand the opening of the word right now that's what he's saying third pool you remember it he said you have so many impersonations on this what you've tried to explain I said don't even try this do you remember how many remembers that Nation well it's all over the tape and everywhere that's been about six years ago seven years ago been seven years ago see you go back from here to 63 you'll be 1956. seven years ago it would be 1956 21st totally okay so don't try to explain that this is that third pull but I'll meet you in there that's right he said don't cry I was standing with a little baby's shoe when he told me or make your first pull and when you do the fish will run after the lure he said then you watch your second pool said because there will only be small fish he said then the third pool will get it all them ministers got around and said Brother Brad we know you can do it hallelu your brother Brown that's where I always get tied up with a bunch of preachers see I love people and I want you to explain everything this that and I said well oh oh I said I don't know I said I've understood I understand fishing I said now the first thing you do when I'm reading this to where you put it back to the other Vision so the no keep it going through the divisional part here's the West End you see all the fish around you got the jerk Galore well that's exactly the tank is fishing so I said jerk Allure now you can see when I jerk The lure that first time now the fish takes out after it but they were little ones that's just like they were catching so then I said then you'll you'll see it I'm gonna Jerk it Out of the bank and I had to fix but it looked like a skin Over The Lure it was it just it was so little and then I was standing there and something said I told you not to do that and I started crying all the line was Tangled around me like this and had was standing there crying with my head down like that and I said God all for you uh forgive me I'm a stupid person Lord don't forgive me and I had this line and that what I got in my hand was a little baby shoe about that long and I had that string was about as bigger around as my finger about a half inch like that and the eyelet in the shoe was just about the size of a looter than 1 16 probably of an inch of the Olive and I was trying to lace this little shoe up with this great big inch cord and a voice come and said you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things said let them alone now that may be missing off of your you can't teach Pentecostal baby Supernatural thing and just then he picked up and took me up and set me way up high to where a meeting was going on look like a 10 or a cathedralist or some sort you know and there was a little box black little place over on the in the side and I've seen that light was talking to somebody above me and that light that you see there on the picture your world away from me like that and went over to that tent I'll meet you in there said this will be the dirt Bull and you won't tell it to nobody and in Sabina Canyon he said this is the third pool and there's three three things that goes with it one unfolded today or yesterday the other one unfolded today and there's one thing that I cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language but I was standing right there and looked right straight at it this is the dirt bull coming up in the holy spirit of God oh my that's the reason all heaven was solid now I better stop here and I just feel checked not to say no more about it just remember the seventh seal the reason it was not open see the reason it did not reveal it no one should know about it and I want you to know before I ever note any word about that that Vision come years ago you remember that and here it is just as the other has slides right straight into the word exactly where it was God knows my heart I never one time thought of such a thing as that and here it was it's later than we think oh my just shows it's from God for it just exactly in the promises of God from the end of the message you notice notice now for the end time message this seal after all he's revealed all the six seals but it don't say nothing about the seven and the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible before knowing that and remember Revelations 10 seven one to seven chapter ten one to seven at the end of the seventh Angels message all the mysteries of God should be fulfilled we're at the end the opening of the seventh seal now there is one of the things that people say that's a tent they'll agree and bring up to the ten up to the seventh seal but they'll say the seventh still is not open brother Reynolds now to come back and tell us what the seventh seal is wow that's one of the things I'm trying to give you I gave you the vision on things and now trying to give you the things that people are expecting and the things you know or what it was so let's just read a few things this day the scripture is fulfilled number seven on your note paragraph 14. and we're trusting that God will give us a blessing out of this word as we read it and you've had Billy told me to tell you that you sure had fine corporations and people here that's been in the parking system the police and everything keep it up that's very very good we hope to see the time maybe in the near future no this is 1965. and brother Brown was still looking for something all right we hope to see the time maybe in the near future when maybe we could bring the tent here to the city and put it out here in the ballpark or we could stay for some length of time maybe for three or four weeks Revival constantly and here we just barely get to know each other and then we have to say goodbye and we go again but I'd like to come and stay an extensive trip one time where you could study so we don't have to close out in a night or two and just stay and teach day and night day and night on and on maybe somebody go home feed the chickens melt the cows and come back next week and continue on with the service I like that so the Lord be with you reading that he was looking for something 1865 he had told division and he comes into the seals and he said this is that third pool right the third pool's the opening of the word so irregardless of what's going to take place anywhere he comes back or whatever it is got to be the opening of the word right that's all I've been blown about say it's got to be the opening of the word all right now watch what he said here on the message this day the scripture is fulfilled all right and remember we was reading from this daily scriptures fulfilled he was wanting to bring attended right up in the time look what he says he talks about the same song that rides in the East and say it's not exists in the west side Son of God to come into East and meditate himself as God manifests in the flesh is the same Son of God in the Western Hemisphere here that's identifying himself among the church tonight the same yesterday and forever the evening light of the sun has come this day this scripture is fulfilled before us paragraph 172. were we at in this abrahamic age where are we in this great time we're standing the great hour that we're living in all the Visions that's been fulfilled did work so all right no more self-interpretation of that it's just flatter what he said he said all of these have been fulfilled now you've got these to read when you get home so I'm going to give you a few things without having to read so much just for a few minutes real quick unspoken word is Original Seed a lot of people take this message to try to prove right around them has got to come back and to do the things because of the some of the things that he said on the spoken words region proceed and on that message it's the same as it is in the church age book and you know and he's explaining something and he's explaining a twofold part of his ministry and I believe in a twofold part of his ministry I believe he had a Ministry to return the faith of the Father's Day and then he had the opening of The Seven Seals to bring that forward I believe that's electrical part so they take this part here and though and say that the Forerunner are that Moses had to go into the wilderness and stay because of the people wouldn't accept him right and then he came out and delivered it is wrong and they say that brother Branham had to go off the scene stay off the scene and then would come back and Deliver us and take us through now if that's true I praise God and hope it isn't they don't know but the only thing I've ever said is I'm not just not sitting down you know being careful you're you'll make it like catching a bush you know you're just going to catch a bus and go out of here I don't think so right because now even with brother Brown if you read it when you go home read it then you talk about Moses it wasn't on the part for Moses it was on the part for the people right and the people had to be crying out for God to send a deliverer now let's send the message spoken word to read and see before the deliverer could come I say to you and I whatever you're looking forward to are there anybody listening what you're looking forward to whether it be brother Branham coming back and putting up a tent or whatever it be whatever if we're not crying out for a deliverer all right nothing's not going to take place it's in your hands and mine right the crying out was for the people which had to be crying out for a deliverer and God sent Moses right brother Brown came within one part of his ministry to return to Faith of the fathers yes then he had the part of bringing his message to carry you and I out of here that's right you see that was that's what he's explaining spoken words Original Seed go read the whole thing I gave it to you go read the whole thing he said now this is the time this has got to be this way this is that away all right The Waiting was not for Moses but for the people to get ready to receive Moses Moses thought the children would understand that he was sent I never wrote it he did so it is now like Elijah after that Mighty Vindicated Prophet for the word of God came to after he finished his preaching had to be taken off the scene see they say well that's what the thing it is right around had to be taken off the scene and he's going to come back and he's going to bring a tent and go across the country and and you know preach to the people and bring us to rapturing Faith all right now I gave you these in here don't have time at 1509 we got to hurry to hurry a lot of it is based upon as I said that people believe silly because even brother random will go backwards and forth as to say yeah and they are arguing right now among the people of the message that the seventh seal is not broke now the Bible said it was Revelation day one when it opened the seventh seal right yeah that's the bottom all right what did run around saying when he's saying the seven still not open right he's saying just what he said back there when he tried to explain it the angel of the Lord in the tent Visa said don't try to explain this he said this will never be made known and I gave you quote after quoting around said this will never be made known to the public you cannot give this message to the public any of this message won't go to the public they won't receive it all right and how could they understand about seven seal that's why like I said they click on the internet and they read about all these fanaticisms and they make us a Jim Jones you know what I'm talking about I'm out there might not have ever heard about it but Jim Jones years ago let the people down over Guyana and Kurt them down there and and killed a bunch of them they killed ourselves and all because you know and it's all kind of things going around the world today everywhere and everybody's looking for some kind of a deal brother random will tell you the seventh seal this is coming right right man that's the reason it can't be made known to the public it's the coming of the Lord now then I want your status a little bit and then you can think what you want to I've always said this one time and you show me anything that I've ever seen anything contrary I believe in a returning Ministry right amen I believe in the Kid Vision I believe what the prophet brought I believe he brought his message and I believe he will probably be the first in the resurrection because that would be scriptural because the first shall be last unless you'll be perfect that would be fine that's the reason I say that we're having to deal with it now maybe there might be enough Faith among the people at this time to be able to draw some of the people out of the ground but we don't have enough Faith to bring the prophet out of the ground that we're done I believe the dependence is upon you and I if he's coming back to preach to us the dependence is upon you and I to be crying out because that's why read spoken words Original Seed and you'll see it that's what was happening the people had to be crying for deliverance are you crying for deliverance are you just sitting down well I don't know what to expect I'll be pushing along a little and I'm just I don't know I don't want to get caught up in them beat things and get confused you already confused honey you was born confused do we need to get unconfused well who knows about them you know the prophet of God one of the things of the seven Thunders they say he's got to come back and tell us what the Thunders are we've just been through that with the message we covered where it run around covers that the seven Thunders and the revelations 3 27 Church any book Revel the hunters and Revelation detained in the Seven Seals he said that's what it was about in the seals for the Thunder the Thunder we just went through it we brought around covered that the Thunder is the voice of God these are on the internet where they can read it if they'll pull it up you have them to read he said the seven Thunders would bring us rapturing faith and rapturing Grace so we've never we don't know what you are with the prophet God said it's the voice of God when the seal from it right right let's see I believe right around we'll be back in the resurrection and we're going to have 30 40 days according to Dubai and what I understand the prophet and understand the Bible I'm comparing it back when Jesus was here right they were the dad's going to raise and then we went to the line remains will be changed a moment with 30 40 days the day is going to be among us now you think as I always tell you you think we're going to come to church and we'll walk out safe post this building's full tonight yeah you look around get your straight jacket cause any boys going crazy I said no that sets those Saints they've raised you think we're going to just walk around oh Gloria Hallelujah the resurrections come on I think it's going to be a shouting Gloria Hallelujah wonderful time with you and we'll have 30 40 days it run around we can preach to us that's right all right but why can't we get settled in what he's already preached that's right right he's already told us the tent and what it was that it would be the third pull the opening of the word now that's his words not mine but see people wanted something they can depend upon some kind of something that they can look at and put their hands on why can't we put our hands upon the word of God 40 something years we've been studying this message and don't know what the prophet is saying right what's wrong with it right oh we've been in Walmart excuse me you should go to church with a brother he said I'm staying at Walmart and got a message you did I'm not arguing with it even on my business but I I've got a few in places myself but I'd rather be sitting in my study studying the message you know been walking around in Walmart and then I go all our freaks when I come out with women's dressed in the hour oh that's what the brother doing I'm sorry but I'm just trying to tell you honestly what I've always said you can't interpret a vision of a prophet you let him interpret that right but when that Prophet said that that first pool was to take in the People by hand was a fulfillment of the fishing and we read it you're hungry second pause to know the secrets of the heart and that was the Fulfillment of the fundament of the fishing and jerking The Lure out of the water and he says the third pull was restored in his hand which is the word of God Amen right and there's no way to explain the word of God to people no wonder the third pull is a total Secret and even in compassion as I said a moment ago Jesus went and preached the souls that were in prison under his third poor ministry right brother random isn't it odd that he turns around and he said there I was in JC Penney's seeing people coming up those escalators that looked exactly like when he had went to hell and saw those people there's a doctrine that we're in hell now I don't think so no pretty nice place I don't want to stay here a long time but like somebody said we're already in the Millennium I don't think so about that because there's too many Devils involved around right yeah all kind of doctrines among the people the message thank you but what do you think about it I want to just keep going in the word and whatever God does let him do it but if I'm in the word I'll be prepared what but if I under shiftly lays no long like bombs and not doing nothing right I wouldn't have wanted wrote the book right I didn't write the thoughtful Ministry whispering to perfecting of the science right and I wasn't the prophet that said they worked to do that to take these things and sweep them on the wordish people depend upon the ministry okay they depend upon if you agree with him yeah right everybody likes you if you agree with them we just differ a little bit you find out people don't like it too well amen amen they stayed with Jesus for the fish and the loaves but when he began to Tire their doctrines up they left that's right that's where I've always been the same 40 something years I've always said run around if you come back and preach too much right now I'm not sitting down waiting on something to happen I'm trying my best to get in it and cry for deliverance what are you doing you know that years ago they started out in West with a tent and come to Indiana with it and said they believed when they got the early brother random was going to meet them but you see all these doctrines and ideas is all tied to trying to confuse the people instead of straightening out anything yep let your Prophet interpret the visions and when he says this is what it is that's what it is right but you know what I believe he was so much a mortal human being that he was still looking for something to happen and I'm going to say this and quit if you and I ever get to the place that we're not looking for something for God to do something and move on we've done cabbage down and we're in bad shape that's why I encourage you to read the message hearing the message study the message amen what do you want you got plenty of time to read career dominate or McDonald's either if it's in Jamaica you got plenty of time to read it but this message Cody a lot of things go wrong you got time enough to be able to read everything else but don't study the message I'd hate your ass right now or how many have read a book or listened to a tape this week but we're ready for the rapture right right just remember your profit spoken words Original Seed read it he said the people had to be crying out before God sent Moses back that's right so if you believe in a tent literally I've run around coming back and preaching then we need to be crying for deliverance okay but now let's get the reasons on everybody's happy we're doing good well you know the feathers are fixing to be pulled out from under us and I never have been one to kind of Glory in in you know bad things but I am one that believes one night if God needs to take the feathers out of the nest for us to get home to the Thorns remember the Eagles they let him pull the nest if we need to be hungry to get desperate that's right let it come right amen amen all right never worried about it because I can go back in there and see in the Bible that God always provided he said I've never seen a righteous forsaken never received bacon bread that's right it's already been proved a lady over in Africa years ago they could go in there and dip out that meal and go cook all they wanted to they go back and come right back documented is being true but are we crying for deliverance what do you see and I'll make a statement and I know that I'm not popular and doing it you see a lot of people that don't depend upon the powerful Ministry and they got what they call tight churches around the country they don't have no pastures and they have a tape recorders they're pastor they only listen to brother Brown because they don't want to get confused I'll challenge any of them amen you tell me you name them I'll show you the most confused people there is all right I'm talking about Dwayne language that's why you know when I told my brother one day I said you show me a tight group of people and I'll show you backslidden people he said my brother goes to a church and I said in their backslid now tell me they're not he said well now because there's no live minister in front of us they fast forward them tapes yeah right church we need to be crying out for deliverance that's right seeking God every day for fathermen of the word to be open unto us crying out for a Deliverance because the hours late what are we going to do come on brother let's stand take on these things see that I've always been the same I'm looking forward things to take place but I'm not failing to look at what's already taking place if I see God Among Us I don't mind telling you that God is Among Us we don't see I don't see it like I want to either it was it was it Martin wasn't satisfied until everybody in his church had the leading of the spirit and he said every service that was major Miracles took place mom because everybody there was in one mind in one corner that's when I'm crying out for a church is for you and I to come to a position to where we're all crying before I delivered you know a lot of us are getting old enough we ain't going to be around here too much longer yeah and a lot of you young that might not be around here as long as that's old ones are all right I want to be ready my mom said to be ready yes that day here baby in my home are we getting far are we getting uneases together foreign why oh my God there's so much more anybody else foreign mine during this year didn't see anybody else Brothers foreign anybody else bring it into the right place with me anybody else oh okay father well it's just about me Lord We
