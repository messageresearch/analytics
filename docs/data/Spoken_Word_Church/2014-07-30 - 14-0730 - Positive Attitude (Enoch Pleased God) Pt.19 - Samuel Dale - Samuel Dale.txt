Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you to see you high and lifted up Shing the light of your glory pour out your power in love as we sing Holy Holy Holy high and lift it up shin the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy You Are Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy I want to see into his word you'll find him and good to be in the house of the Lord GL to have our visitor with us we met the brother down at brother Johnny and brother Mark's here the other day and glad to see him John Hunt we're glad to have him with us and we always say when you come here one time you're a visitor you're welcomed you come two times you're not welcomed you just become a part of us and that's that's what it is you just become a part of us we don't have anything to join any parts of doing that way we're just part of the body of Christ amen if you'd like turn in your scriptures where we've been reading from Hebrews 11 and we'll try to get right into our thoughts and remember the sick ones and all remember brother Gary's been having a lot of trouble so just pray that the Lord would would reach down and touch him and take care of those things that's bothering him and all he sounds good but yet he's still having a lot of troubles and all with the the different things and uh let's see remember also this coming Saturday will be the Bible study so remember 6 o' this coming Saturday all right Hebrews 11 Heavenly Father we thank you for all the things that you've given unto us and your love and your grace that you've bestowed upon us in the days that you would save our souls that you'd fill us with your love and an understanding that you would guide us into the opening of Thy word that we could be able to see the day and the hour that we're living the time that we are here and Lord to Le look at that then that's the joy of of it all is to find who we are and what we're doing we love you and we thank you now we commit everything to you touch each one remember Brother Gary there Lord and touch him and take care of the problems and all Let Your Grace be sufficient in Jesus name amen now we've been reading this for quite a while so maybe you ought to be able to memorize this scripture Hebrews 11 we'll read 1 through two and then we'll jump over to five in verse 6 for the thought tonight now Faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report now that's what we're doing right taking the elders to see their report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear all right by faith Noah we on verse five was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God all right I hope we get over to this but to make sure we get the insert that Paul makes relating to us but without faith it is is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him you may be seated Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now you know our brother uh brother Hunt he's done a an extended uh documentary on brother brandham so it's not a new thing to him but what we say brother brandham this or whatever and uh so he studied that and uh you know and I'm sure he's seen all of the fallacies that has been written about him I'm sure he could probably tell you all of the things were that is written that a lot of people believe he was God you know and then all kind of infallibility and things that they tried to attack on to doings and all of the fanaticism that goes with it but the only thing that I would ask him to do is to think about if he read a documentary or made a documentary point on Martin Luther he would find a lot of those things in the days of Martin Luther the days of John Wesley uh if you wrote a documentary on him you would find a lot of fanaticism and things and all but the main thing is is to um go through all of that and come out of it with the understanding that we do not believe that he was God no way because that would be getting into the wrong Point all right we believe that God used the man just as I believe God used Martin Luther I firmly believe in the just shall live by faith all right a firm believer in the the Methodist Doctrine now not the fanaticisms that goes around but the doctrine of sanctification because I believe in that I believe you you need to have a daily sanctification even after you're born again Paul said I Die daily see all right then the Baptist would come along with the bringing some of the Eternal Securities and the predestination and the things back and I believe that it's like I've told you John Smith the former the founder of the Baptist he prayed so much for the sins of the people his wife would have to lead him to The Breakfast Table to feed him you know because he was a great sinere man we're not against any church system not against the Catholics not against anything I'm against the system of it yeah because the system is what leads you away not the people all right they have made their doctrines and ideas and that's L I said and I don't whatsoever don't hold no problems with saying that the biggest portion of the people who follow the end time as we call it message have already denominated and and doing the same thing all the others has done all right and and that's you know that's always been that way but I just ask him to think about you know the things he heard the man had taught and then if he has any problems with that to come and ask us and we'll try our best to express it you know into human terminologies and all but the main thing that to me that has always caught me is was that he could bring us the word into the simple form that we could believe it it was for us you know I mean I always tried to believe in a real God you know as a kid and coming down but I I just from what people taught in the churches and the things we you couldn't find that God but you know when I begin to hear this man in the end time expressing the word of God then I said but hey and that's one of the one that I want to listen to and and we thank God for the truth in all in the hour that we're living all right but now remember our point of what we've been talking about about nobody in the Bible ever amounted to anything nobody all the way through unless they had a very positive attitude and that's the point that I've been trying to get us to have for a long time is a positive attitude about things all right and something real nobody has ever amounted to anything unless they had something personal with God see as I've always said about Martin Luther there's no telling how many times that he preached that J shall live by faith no telling how many documentaries he made on he was a great Theologian you know he probably make great uh speeches about it but one day God dropped down into his heart and see the Catholic Church wasn't afraid of him until it dropped into his heart then when it dropped into his heart they still wouldn't afraid of him because he was only one man but when he began to get to people to see what he was talking about they became excited about this man that was turning the world upside down and that's more down see in our time let alone back in the others but see I believe in having a personal experience with God I believe every person must have that you know no matter what mama daddy is brother sister whatever is we must have a personal experience of our own and something we can stand on right and in the hour of trouble it'll hold us whereas if it won't until that point but that's that's what I'm trying to get us to see is to look in the Bible see those that Paul would use and say that in verse two there that the elders obtained a good report you know uh they became a great witness they had a great testimony it was something that an experience they had cuz all of those are what the word report means see it's something you live through all right and an experience of finding the same God that Paul knew all right the same one that walked the shores of Galilee that we call the Lord Jesus Christ to have a personal experience of that and the then be as uh what we spoke of a second ago then you know Paul said one day he said follow me as I follow Christ well that's the way we follow brother brandom but you know I also Follow by believing it I follow Martin Luther's doctrine of the just you live by faith right I follow that because I believe that I'm a firm believer in anchoring into these and each Church system if you've done a documentary on to each one you would find their their beginners at a very uh profound effect upon mankind with what God had spoke to them about and I believe that you know all right I just believe that we've got to go on now and it's got to continue and and take you and I off the Earth one day somebody's going to walk off the earth in a Rapture all right now the Enoch we're going to speak of tonight see he was not because God took him all right see then there's something happened to him that brought him to a place that he could just walk off the earth all right then you know we'll take that point of looking at him as he made a report now I I want to know the report he made all right that that's that's my point I want to know the report he made because we went through Abel that di because it speaks of him in the fourth verse that Abel made a report one day that God was real because he offered the right sacrifice all right he believed in a real God not just a god of of uh trees and flowers and fruits and things he saw that it was blood he saw that God had when when his mama and daddy had sinned he saw that God didn't go out and get flowers they tried it with fig leaves you remember and what would be the difference in fig leaves or oak trees or pomegranates or apples or whatever it wouldn't work on anything if it'd work on one thing it' work on anything else all right but see Abel Knew by revelation God had spoken to him in his heart by Revelation but why didn't Cain see that it's my point I mean even after he had uh argued with his brother God comes down and talks to him talks to Cain this is not a an outlandish thing that you know that so sinful to no he was a he's a very sincere person he come and offered his sacrifice he done all the things but yet he was confused but why couldn't he look back and see as I brought out Sunday that you know there abble was he could look back and he could say mama and Daddy what happened back there and theyd say well when we sinned uh God made skins for us well then he knew it was blood would be the only atonement because if blood was the atonement there not a bunch of flowers or fruit or whatever you want to call it you know but to believe it see and doing it all right now in getting that straight we see that that Abel had a revelation had faith faith is a revelation all right and we've just read here and we keep reading it in verse one for the purpose because it says faith is the substance back up in verse 38 of the chapter above you'll find that that's a discussion that Paul is making and he says that the just shall live by faith then he precedes in the 11th chapter to explain what faith is it's the substance of things hopeful are all right it's the evidence of Things Not Seen so whatever would ever come into being would have to be brought into being We Believe by the creative act of almighty God right all right and where would God bring that from remember he created it it was the word that created it so then faith is a revelation of the word of God all right so then Luther caught the just shall live by faith when it was revealed into his heart see then he didn't care what went on You Realize by him going out to do that they was going to excommunicate him and by excommunicating him and then it that mean he's lost that was what it meant back there if you didn't stay with that you lost they excommunicated you all right but see he knew then Luther knew that there was something real that's what I'm trying to get you and I to talk about a real God not mythologies or thoughts or imaginations or or forms is God real to you or is it just what mama told you daddy told you somebody told you remember the Bible says no man can call Jesus the Christ except what except it be by the Holy Ghost by the new birth right all right something personal to you outside of that you're saying what somebody else says you're only talking about the God of somebody else but when it drops into your heart you got something real and see that real thing will always tie to the word of God see so Abel by Revelation he saw the very coming Messiah because that's what he was speaking of in his sacrifice right his sacrifice was speaking of the coming Messiah all right now as we go on over into doing it then my point has been to what take these elders and their report and see what it means to you and I all right but to see that Abel see spoke of the coming Messiah all right you know it's not mentioned about Enoch offering sacrifices and I believe he did okay don't don't go wrong on me now but I mean it's not emphasized about the sacrifices in Enoch and his doing it emphasized that he pleased God that's it all right now so then I want to know I believe I know how Abel had a personal revelation that it was blood and speaking of the coming Messiah right good all right but now remember Enoch by not dying and walking off the Earth he was the type of the Rapture of the Bride to come in the end time all right now Noah we'll get to it later when we're studying it Noah raises up rides over comes back down he's a type of the tribulation Saints and the people of doing those things it each one has a place and an order of what's doing but the main point to Enoch is what he pleased God now see we say within our own hearts and lives well that's my desire is to please God but you know that Paul is a good to it in a little while Paul in Romans 8 and8 I believe it is he said no flesh can please God see now then what is the point that we want to take I believe now that Enoch could look back and see see what Abel had and believed it he believed Abel had a revelation of God you know a real to spoke of the coming Messiah so then Enoch is not going to speak of the coming Messiah so it doesn't speak about an offering tied in with him it speaks of the pleasing God all right now as I said don't misunderstand me I believe Enoch offered sacrifices those all of them did they were commanded to do all right but the emphasis I'm trying to make is that you look at something and you see the revealed word that shows you the Messiah all right then you look at the next one that it speaks of and the next one that Paul chooses to use is eno and it says that he please God all right then he makes an insert which is not speaking of necessarily Enoch or anything else it's speaking of you and I he makes an insert there with the sixth verse and he says but without faith it's impossible to believe God because he that cometh to God must believe that he is he not was you know not the god of Grandma Grandpa Daddy's God the preacher's God right must believe that he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek him all right so he makes that insert to show us what faith really is all right see it is the substance of what anything consists of as I say I can hold within my hand enough atoms to blow the world up but there's no way that I can do anything with that but through the process of science they've been able to take that and bringing it from the original substance that it existed as to looking like nothing bringing it out and make an atom bomb from something that you can't see all right I like the way the prophet said one day he said let's get God's Adam Bomb Faith because that's a great thing is Faith because faith will conquer all things don't worry about it that's right who was it wasn't it Martin Luther or one of the men said they said I believe it's Luther they said they we want you to know that the world's against you he said I want the world to know I'm against them that's right he had something real and and that way he didn't he wasn't afraid if you're afraid of what you believe then you don't believe very much all right if you're afraid about it but see Enoch then could look and look and see Abel in what happened all right and then he could stand there upon that but see that was not the thing that Enoch was to do was to believe in the god of Abel right the experience of Abel that's good to talk about other people's experience and tell about them wonderful you know I mean the people of this message are wonderful of talking about how that brother Brandon went around the world seven times there was so many dead raised and all like that I believe it all right you know why I believe it because I've seen the dead rais I ain't been around the world but I've been a little bit all but you see I believe it but Enoch had something to stand on to look back at Abel that's the whole point I want you to follow me throughout the line as we use it coming through these Warriors of faith is to see each one of them could look back and see the other and line up and then here today we can take it as I was trying to show Sunday see I can take what I believe about one true and living God and take it all the way back through the Bible through all of the Patriarchs who met that God through all of the writers through all of the prophets who spoke of that God and go right back to the Garden of Eden and see the very God that killed those animals but I can't take can fruit whatever you want to make it I just get the belly ache out of apples and that's not a joke it's truth you see people before us have already walked on these things as we'll read in a minute where says that and we've already read but we'll emphasize a little Enoch walk with god well have you ever read a little bit about Noah you know that Noah walked with God but now brother Dale he only represents this but he had to represent that but is the god of Enoch greater than the god of Noah oh now you're getting in the wrong way it's examples and things that are said in the Bible to preed to show us all right he not trying to make a little God here and a big God there all right but are you listening to me see when Enoch looked at the report of Abel and he knew what he had tried to make a report of or was doing in his life was real and see if you can't look back and see the ones prior to you in their Revelation and see that it lines up there's only one revelation of God see that's why you can't go back into church allies and get this Doctrine and get that Doctrine are brandom doctrines romit as we call them today that's got this Doctrine and that Doctrine and all kind of flying doctrines all right but we can look in the word of God and see whether it fits or not all right now and to do that then think about what I'm saying because see we're going to we're going to get into something in some uh take out some thoughts that are in people's mind as we go along you know that brother brandham would say uh that uh Noah dra Enoch and seen him leave and he started building an ark well you said well that can't be true cuz it's too much time wise but see you're not listening to what the man says you're only trying to make everything fit together amen brother Ren will say Noah walk with God for f uh Enoch walked with God for 500 years he was only 365 years old but see if you know what you're talking about you don't worry about it do you well he was wrong here and he was wrong there he was a human being but you know sometimes the wrongs might you to think about him it might be saying something uh I'm 74 years old but you know I walk with God before the foundation of the world according to the scripture remember when the morning Stars Sayang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy if you have the new birth in your heart tonight that new birth was back there not you as people come on so was brother Rand off or was he saying things that maybe for us that we need to listen and see so what would be the difference in Noah's walk and Enoch's walk in the typologies you're typing one is the bride and the other is a foolish virgin in wordings you're saying that Noah rose up went over and come back down Enoch went off but you remember Elijah went off in a chariot you know all right that's what I'm saying in we take the word but the main thing I'm wanting us to do is to see what is relation to you and I that's it all right amen see then if I can find out how Enoch walked with God and pleased him if I walked that way are you listening if I can find that walk Brother Ray and just walk that way I wish old brother fory was here got this black brother he's really good at that black man's walk you know that's a strut you know the way they and you you'd get a good life cuz that's the way he'd say we just got to walk out way but I'm just want to know how Enoch walked because if I can find out how he walked I might be able to find out how I need to walk right if he gave a report and his report was that he please God all right now think about it first off let's get a few things out of the way in the natural Enoch's name in the first I told you other day that you were to go read the Bible if you'd read the Bible you'd find out a few things see because you a lot of people read the Bible and they grab up the Bible you tell them something they grab up the Bible they read it and they read Enoch the first Enoch was direct descended from Cain his first son was named Enoch all right now then you come along later and find out that Enoch comes from Adam down through Jared or how you pronounce it and that's the one who walked with God their names are identically the same which I think it means rest but think about it Paul was telling us that any Walk With God all right in Genesis 5 and 24 it says Enoch walked with God and was not for God took him in Hebrews 11:5 it says he was translated because he pleased God so there's no recording in the genus's account of how he walked or whatever it just says he walked and it was not for God took him all right Paul gets it by Revelation looking back and sees him and he knows the walk he made all right he knows the walk the man made and he knows how that it done because it pleased God but then he gives the secret in the next verse when he says it's impossible us to please God without having the same paraphrasing it without having the same Faith Enoch had right so now what's he saying the prophet says on the first seal message paragraph 122 he said Enoch had raptured Faith we're always quoting and I use it a lot of times I say rapturing faith but the technical word is raptured Faith all right he pleased god with raptured Faith all right now he was translated because he pleased God now I'm not making it carnal as to show the kind of walk you make cuz you know better than that whether he limped or whether he done you know you can go back in the Bible and do it you know you do have a Jacob there but when he became an Israel he walk different I mean you can go back into those things that's fine but Enoch pleased god with raptured faith now Jude 114 speaks of Enoch in a way that is not mentioned in Genesis are mentioned in Hebrews it mentions there and it says uh Enoch prophesied that the Lord was coming with 10,000 of his Saints no Enoch was a preacher all right you know Enoch built the Pyramid right everybody follow that he credited as the building of the one called chops with no Capstone on it it was built in the time there and they Creed Enoch as to building that and the pyramids was what a Bible in stone the first one was written in the heavens second one was written in the pyramid the third was written on into paper or you know what we call the Bible all right so Enoch wrote a Bible in building a pyramid so he had a good revelation right are you listening he had a good Revelation he had a great understanding of God what does I say it then do you walk by go with God uh naturally or do you walk spiritually with God which way is it you see our walk should be in faith or in the word of God not that our natural lives are not important but they are secondary right it's Faith first then Works see that's where Cain thought it was fully works so he went with his thought of it was Works he would have been all right had he offered the lamb first and then tried to appease God you remember how we brought that out Abel he offered a sacrifice Cain tried to appease all right what are we doing what is our Revelation right is it our goodness well according in to the Bible that says that our goodness is what filthy rags now it doesn't not mean I keep saying that where people won't get me wrong it does not mean that you're not supposed to live right that you just go live like the devil and God will take care of it now that's garbage can that's come down through organized religion and ideas of people all right but like I told you many times I'm not trying to get you to be good I'm trying to get you to be born again all right then if the goodness doesn't follow us you know if the life doesn't follow us walking in the word of God then we prove that we were not saved to start with that's plain language all right but see people that hear me talk and they say oh he don't believe in living right he believe just living like the devil and then God us some way through Grace now I didn't say that you get the idea CU I've never taught nothing like that remember every who's your master is that scripture you are the slave to one master or the other you're either a slave to God or you're either a slave to the devil the biggest hypocrite is one claiming to be slave to God and is really still a slave to the devil all right get that out of the way to where people want how the wrong idea about what you're saying all right see it's not your goodness that pleases God all right then it must be by faith it must be by the revealed word the word Made Alive into our hearts is a revealed word what I'm talking about now as I said then if it's you say it's revealed to you and then you go out and live like the devil you're a hypocrite you're lost the best way to say it if that ain't you know strong enough for understanding the people all right see Enoch walked with God because he believed God remember the emphasis Paul put when he inserted go he that does this must believe that God is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so he must believe that dooch was not one of these that was just halfhazard Le he was a good man right but you know what probably in that day there was probably a lot of good people just like today there's a lot of good people in this world today they go to church they serve God they do different thing no there's a lot of good people give you anything in the world take care of you help you do it whatever but we can't depend upon that because see works is supposed to be Faith expressed it's supposed to be an outward manifestation of an inward work what we're doing is trying to polish up the outside to make it look good and say oh I'm good you remember the illustration we gave Sunday a man standing there you know in prayer with the Lord Jesus talking about he says I fast every day I do this I give this I do that and Lord I thank you I'm not like him well you know he had every right to say what he said but he done it right remember he's talking to God God could have easily said hold it you didn't do that one hold it you didn't do that one so he didn't do it he he meant it and God knew that he meant it the other one just said father forgive me now which one went home the Bible said Justified all right so then Enoch walked upon on the revelation of the God that he knew was real you said but Brother D wouldn't even know Bible back there how could he walk they wouldn't know Bible back there in the beginning how did they will know how to offer blood it's the writing of the Bible right Enoch wrote the whole Bible in the pyramid so if he did then he wrote the whole entire book of books everything in the Bible was our and you get into pyramidology and it runs crazy but you get in there and study those things of The Upside Down Chambers the three blocks that block you from upwards to the to the Queen's chamber then get into the king's chamber there's a lot of good things in there but yet there's a lot of pyramidology that's crazy they claim you build a a u a milk carton in the form of a pyramid and the milk lies longer you know there's all kind of garbage cans all right they claim it was a space stationed to contact the aliens from the other countries World they got all kind of doctrines but now look as I said to start with Enoch he saw Abel as to what he was speaking of maybe not understanding everything or every form that we talk about it but yet he understood that Abel saw God as being real he didn't sit out then and saywell what I need to do now I need to make sure that I live right that's good wonderful praise the Lord you make a good neighbor right get born again and then let that take place and you make a Christian with outward manifestations of an inward work right okay so it wasn't how good he walked that's the emphasis I want you to get because it says that he pleased God right now I only know of one way to please God and that's to take him at his word and you think about that you consider that thought you take him at his word you believe his word you hold on to his word you walk in his word but see you can't take your other side and run it because man tries to do that but what are you going to do with David I don't have time to get into it we will as we get over to him but David was listen Ed as a man after God's Own Heart right yet he was a whoremonger an adulterous he was all kind of things man he would you wouldn't want him as your neighbor right you wouldn't want to live in a neighborhood with all the Davids in it as bad as they were but yet the Bible say he was going B after God's Own Heart but God said that he didn't look he said your sacrifice and offerings he said they become a stink in my nostrils right he said but what I Look to is an honest and a contrite heart so that's what he saw in David you see that's what pleased God was Enoch to walk now listen in the word and preach the gospel for his day because he was a preacher that's what he was doing if he prophesied of the Lord coming with 10,000 of his Saints that's just one of I said it's not listed in Genesis and Hebrews about that Jude picks it up and looks back and sees that Enoch was a preacher he went around trying to get people to see the God that he believed in don't you believe Abel spent the rest of his life I mean Seth picking up after Abel don't you think Seth picked it up of the same point and tried to convert the people to the belief that Abel had had and brought down to them don't you think Adam probably felt pretty bad did he produced two kids one of them thinking it was blood and one of them thinking it was fruit and then one of them kills the other one because of his belief in the blood don't you think Adam probably got converted as we'd call it to thinking about well I should have listened to Abel but I know what happened but my point is what Abel had to report or made to report was about him because this is Paul writing about these different ones so the report is being made is by Paul but he's looking back into their lives and expressing it to you and I right all right and his report is that he pleased God and I'm honest now I don't think Enoch was walking out through there with everything so much and thinking you know if I walk good and straight and I do things right God will just take me off the earth I think it was a surprise when he took an evening stroll and you know I illustrate it you remember how he built the Pyramid so he was out there walking up and maybe walked upside you know it pretty rough to start with it blocks and then they just made it straight but Enoch could have just walked up through there one day and got up to the top before they sealed it off it would have been possible and uh he just took one more step and he said well I don't know what's holding me up I'll just take one more you know see God was putting under his feet the substance that he needed to be able to walk now I don't think he walked up as we want to call it up to the universe because he would run out of a God would have had to made him a spacit you know going out into the outer space so it's really not that much anyway of trying to find out you know I love the way the prophet said he said he said those people sold are under the altar he said they're only 20 ft over there at a slant now Einstein would have took that and he said that guys knows what he's talking about heaven is not millions of miles off it's just another dimension Enoch just stepped off walked off went into another dimension was not you didn't have to walk through space so far Elijah took a chariot one day and he rode up there it's not something that we got to go 14 million like the the Russians said they went all the way to the moon and back said we didn't see no God but it didn't F to listen to the things it was written about some of those people that did go there was a flying object went with them you read the story and come back they just looked out the window they didn't know where he was at but it's all right listen folks Enoch had a positive attitude and he walked with God and preached all he knew about that God right living a good life yes but God was not looking at his good life he was living he doesn't look at your good life he looks at your Revelation that you have of him because he knows he said it there is none good good know not one that's the Lord Jesus's statement so humanly speaking what do we think Enoch walked so perfect oh he just Pro perfect 365 years he never had a dirty thought he never said nothing wrong he never done nothing he just walked he just kept walking I don't think he'll get anywhere like that except tired and once you try to walk in the word of God the devil's going to be after you and you're going to be he's going to be stirred up we could get into Noah about that right I mean job about that we'll get over there eventually now that job you know because of him being the Bible says righteous perfect have you considered my servant job he's perfect and here comes his buddies along want to condemn him for being perfect right do you understand what I'm trying to say that God is not looking at our lives he's hearing our voice to the blood right you remember how we brought out the other day Abel's blood would speak you know Abel's blood cried out to God what was it it was Abel's revelation of God not his voice he was hearing out of there but we took him all the way down into paradise and brought him out of paradise right then the Bible says that the blood of Jesus Christ speaketh better things than this because Abel's blood could only speak of death and judgment and things but the blood of Jesus Christ speaks of righteousness and peace and salvation so I still want to hear the voice speaking because he's speaking by Revelation what are you trying to say what about your Revelation Enoch had the revelation of God and you know what he bypassed death right now he was there as an example but remember that's what all of those were there far for the hours of Salvation you and I to be able to come and see what it's speaking of he was just speaking of us Enoch didn't have the new birth that's hard to explain to people but why can't you see it Jesus Christ hadn't died at that time so there was no inward experience of the new birth until after Calvary but yet it says Enoch was not because God took him he said because he pleased him now how do we please God by walking in the word amen and you tell me it's anything else besides that where you going with it I've expressed it over about three times that if you don't walk according to the New Birth the soul the individual if we go out and live like the devil we still belong to the devil don't claim to be saved it it settled one time orever but just remember you will be tempted every moment every day of your life and don't worry about it God can take care of it if we walk in the word you remember the scripture we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and what and the blood of Jesus Christ atones for all sin all right see Enoch was preaching right he was preaching we're going to get to Noah where Noah was a preacher of righteousness yet he winds up when he gets out of the Ark and puts a Vineyard grow some grapes and gets drunk right dies of drunk but just remember Enoch by Revelation without even having the new birth but yet having the soul of an individual being is what we are that God could speak to him and he believed it and he went around telling people about the God that he believed in 300 years or so may be preaching and he Walking with God the whole time yet we don't believe it like that see we want to try to make it some goodness what's going to bring the Rapture as we call it among our ranks Rapture what's going to bring the Rapture to pass well some of these days somebody's going to get good enough well let's get our whips out we will start whooping each other until we all get to the place that we ain't going to do nothing dirty no more you think that's the way it's going to be that's your thoughts and your doctrines you see you can't walk with God on Grandma's Revelation right all right be Enoch no doubt lived a very good life right but his good life was not what pleased God but it was what he could believe God to be you remember the insert Paul said he puts in or it's impossible to please God unless you get it by faith you got to believe that he is not was see trinities won't work then because you got your father son Holy Ghost you getting all messed up so you got to believe that he is to believe that he is you believe in the one true and living God and if Eve messed up in the garden on Hebrews 138 what do you think Enoch was trying to do he was trying to to believe that he was the same yesterday today and forever that's what pleased God you know it's a pleasing thing to a human being I was raised in the country many of you told it and you know the stories yourself used to be a store right where Wade lives and a man sold groceries and stuff and and he worked on another job and raised cattle and farmed and done different things and and you you got ready to go out to the store you just went to the store and there wasn't nobody there and you just walked in and you got what you wanted and you just laid the money down on the counter or either you wrote it down on a piece of papers I Samuel Dale today got two cocas pay you later there was no locks on the homes there was nothing a man's word was his bird word you've heard me tell that when I sold my home that my brother offered me $5,000 profit the very minute I done told my nephew he could have a home for a set price I said you go talk to him you can buy it from him you ain't going to buy it from me if my word wouldn't worth $5,000 and $5,000 1972 was a lot of money still is what's the point I think we should be honest and straight and correct all right we should be people that want to live and do right but we order at the same time realize that Paul is inserting here it's impossible to please God without you having faith without you having a revelation of God and has he ever revealed himself to you are you still wondering whether there's three or whether there's one or what is the point you know well who was he talking to down on the River Jordan when the dove comes down and all are you still in those days and there's nothing pleasing to God about those ideas you see that's why we believe that's the way I do I believe that God sent us a prophet yes that brought us the word I believe that but I know he was a human and made human mistakes in his speech and the different things right but I know that he brought me to a deeper depth of God than anything I had ever studied about before so I follow that Enoch was a preacher you know that brother Brown said it's not even mentioned about Noah but yet he was a preacher but it's not mentioned about him much as preaching you know how it's mentioned he said what he built was his Revelation what Noah built was his Revelation you know what Enoch built was his Revelation he buil a pyramid placed in her all of the things that are needed a Bible in stone he preached the entire Bible how could he walk off the earth without it being the entire Bible right you said wait a minute I got you now because said The Headstone wouldn't put on no that's what caused him walk off the earth Enoch never got to put it on but he's seen it come on Jude 1:14 he said he'll come with 10, thousands of his Saints he seen what it would take to be able to make the rest of that pyramid right come on chopsy with no top put on it why did he leave the top off because there's a stone of stumbling in a rock of a fence and it had to be left off and had to come but it would have to come in the last days and what is the coming of The Headstone in the last days are they going to dig up some secret uh compartment over there somewhere and find all of these things or do something or is it to reveal word of God see I want to walk in the word and walk by what he reveals to me all right see one day I looked and a man started talking to me about the word of God and he said how many gods do you believe in I said one because that is Baptist Doctrine one true and living God that is Baptist Doctrine I was a deacon I was in the higher ranks of it and was in the well thought of at 23 years old made a deacon but he said explain your Gods I said well he's God in three persons Blessed Trinity you know cuz that's all I knew he said you're as much Trinity as anybody else I said what do you mean sir he said because of father son and and Holy Ghost is three Gods when you say a person a person is a personality personality is an individual individual is a person so you're as Trinity as anybody else and I look back at him I said I don't believe that anymore I didn't have to be fault and beat over the head and tried to convince me I knew the man had me standing against the wall as we call it in our human terminologies and I had nowhere to go cuz he planted the word of God what is your Revelation can you walk on it if there's nobody to walk with you can you walk on it or if you leave here today like some people said we I left there and said went down the church next preaching exactly what brother de preached I hope so but are you so blind you don't know what's being preached here cuz I'm not talking about the God of William Brandon come on Amen I'm talking about the Lord Jesus Christ being almighty God who lives in my heart and my life that I'm trying to tell you about and I've had a positive attitude ever since I've been in this message well now I'll tell you I I've had my downs and outs anybody want to check my record and see sure I've been through problems and heartaches and troubles and partings over doctrines and all kind of things but I have never been down about the word of God that's just personal it's impossible to believe God without having faith cuz if not you're going to try to satisfy him with your lives and that's what Cain was trying to do Cain was trying to appease him instead of believing in the atonement he was trying to appease the God but Enoch looked there and he saw God as real and so real until he could walk with him you have never experienced a time that you could walk and know that somebody was with you you got a great experience coming sometimes when it'll happen that you know that there's somebody with you and to know that he's real that he's not just the thoughts of your imagination that you can hear things and no but is he real to you or is it just what somebody else said is it what William brandham taught is it what the Lord Jesus taught is it what Paul taught or is it what's been revealed to you in your heart amen that you know is real see then you don't have to worry about it because like I started off then I can take what I believe back down to the Pentecostals of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts and the back into the Baptist to the Methodist to to the Presbyterian to the Lutheran and pick up the true things they had and walk right on back to the book of Acts and stand with the Apostle Paul on the word of God can you do that well I I I didn't know it had to be that way I just thought it was just us becoming good well when are you going to become good come on you're going at it in the wrong direction you're actually going at it towards death that's what's keeping us here you know we need things a lot of times but we don't get what we need let's go one let me read one thing let's go to number nine brother Joe I want to just read this one the things that we think we need and what God gives us it's taken from there is only one way provided by God for anything listen what he says Enoch needed a ladder when day he had walked 500 years with God now had he walked 500 years or 365 he walked 365 in Earth and was before the foundation of the world if it anything Eternal it'll ever be about him don't brother R's not wrong it's just statements as a human being Mortals making it but look and it pleased God he needed a ladder God provided him a highway walked right up home Elijah needed a robe one day you remember he gave it away one time and God give him a chariot with horses to it Samson needed a spear and God gave him the Jawbone of a m mule and he beat a thousand Philistines God provides your needs God has a way that's all you need is to take What God Says and go to beaten with it just as hard as as you can and get yourself free after a while yes sir Joshua needed a bridge God provided a power a Floodgate spiritual Floodgate that held back Jordan remember stop the waters Daniel needed a fence to keep the lons off of him God gave him an angel and that's what God's provided way you know why because they please God each one of those that you read about they pleased God they walked with God they pleased him God just needed something in the Bible as an example to were you and I could have an example so he uses Noah as an example to ride up and go over and come back down to be the foolish virgins and things you know he used Enoch to be a top of the Rapture right well then we don't have to try to figure out how to do it we just walk and then whatever is needed he'll provide it just take one step at a time and don't worry about it you take a lad and stand up against the wall brother Mo used to say it years ago he said you don't run and jump up a ladder said you going to break your neck he said thing do just start on the first wrong and walk up one at a time I thought we believ that the stature of a perfect man add to your face virt are in Peter would be because of the opening of the word of God the revealing of God's word to you and I I thought that's what we believed then that way what does it take to please God believe his word as I was illustrating a while ago about the neighbors and the things where you didn't have to fence stuff you didn't have to do you had a man's word I remember a man out in Arkansas he needed about $3,000 on a church and a menite neighbor up above there said what do you need he said told him he said he just ched it out he said okay we'll sign papers he said you're shaking my hand that's enough I was raised to believe I was raised to be straight and told to be straight guy in my day told you he was going to whip you he didn't tell you he was going to whip you he just went at it you got told later you got whooped if you woke up see we was raised to be honest and true to believe what a man said the greatest honor that there is in the world and I want you to consider this as I'm closing the greatest honor even in the world is for somebody to believe what you say and you consider that for somebody to really believe that he said it and he meant it and that's it told you about a brother up here in North Carolina real good Minister brother he heard two men men talking and one of them said brother Dale said so and so he told me he said he didn't say that said I know him that was the greatest honor the man could have given me in the world a brand new Cadillac wouldn't have been significant to even think about for him to say I know the man and he didn't say it believe in God's word you know that those two serve God you really have to believe impossible things you cannot explain God you can't explain something that's revealed to you and why you are like you are you can't explain that Martin Luther don't you realize that the world's going to be against you for what you believe he said I want the the world to know I'm against them when are we going to start believing what God says when he says there's one Lord one Lord what it say one one Lord One Faith one baptism why are we going to worry about Father Son and Holy Ghost compared to Lord Jesus Christ word of God's right or wrong that's what you're going to be worried about what are you going to say about it one true and living God when in today they believe in this message that Jesus wasn't a god until the River Jordan he became God and then all one God left him left him as a man to die and that's worse than the Baptist Doctrine I've been against that you know it to believe a man's word is a great thing my wife a lot of times she doesn't know she does it but a lot of times she hurts me real bad because of one thing she'll say honey do you really mean that if I didn't say it if I didn't mean it I don't say it come on you've been with me long enough you ought to know that I walk in that real because I don't say something that I don't mean if I come and told you there's a pink elephant standing out in the yard you better believe there's a pink elephant out there but I'm not going to tell you till I see the Pink Elephant so then don't worry about it ain't no Pink Elephant out there you get what I mean God wants us to believe his word and then just walk day by day one day at a time and walk in the things that he's revealed to us and walk right up that pyramid right there and walk right on out into a change of these bodies Enoch's already proved it can be done and he done it without the new birth why would we stumble at the fact of a new birth and think that God is not with us to lead us remember he that cometh to God must believe that he is not was or going to be and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him Do you see Enoch walk into your own life come on musician can you see it in your own life and say well you know what I've followed some of these things that way because that's the way I've done well you know what that's going to be true I'm just trying to get you to see the god that's in you right we believe God sent the prophets and the things all the way through time but we know one thing there's only one way to know whether a man's a prophet or not that's why we don't worry about brother brandham there's only one way of knowing where a man's a prophet or not if he stays with this the word but if he gets out of this then we get away from it because remember in the Bible say says if a Prophet come and he gives you a sign and the sign comes to pass but said he takes you to another God you don't believe that man but you see we wouldn't raised to do and what we should have been you know that in the Bible that if Wade in the Bible times if Wade got up and prophesied something wrong I'm just supposed to kill him that's just all it is to that's what I supposed to do and that's what a lot of them done just take out and kill him why because he's a liar but see we don't live in them days so we don't go out and kill them we just maybe beat them over the head you know a little but don't kill them but see Could You Walk Off the Earth right now on what you believe that's the question I hope you know what it means not to walk with God is to walk in his word as he reveals it to you so then let's just take it one day at the time Brother D ain't you worried about the days and the times no CU I know he's right on time somebody's going to walk off this Earth one day in a Rapture they're going to be caught up because the word rapture is not even in the scriptures it's caught up see Enoch was caught up in what he believed the God that he saw became real and he just took a stroll and we walk with god what about it let's stand 87 in the red book anybody have a need anybody have a need giving cheer everywhere to the S he go all the while what about it do you see God is real or is he just a thought or imagination we just ask you to go our sister has a friend who has a need we send his prayer call in the name of Jesus Christ amen anybody else every with love make this work out for your honor and Glory that everything be okay report be brought back brother J about can you walk in what you believe if not you better start crawling Anyway come on folks it's time Lord Jesus you know what our brother has need of he's asking you to help him so we believe the help is on the way we commit it all to you we know the story so we just ask you to come on the scene now you work it all out in Jesus name anybody else the scripture says if you can't keep up with a footman what about when the horsemen get here simply meaning if you can't keep up with something slow how you going to do when it gets real fights if you can't walk day by day loving God and serving him with all your heart then don't worry about a change it's not coming for you you're going by the grave why because you can't stand there that day when that's required it's going to be well why can't we believe we're part of it come on why can't we believe we're part of it why can't we say that's me that it's talking about why can't we sa where the Bible says by his stripes I'm Healed why can't I put by his stripes Samuel Dale is heal did that add to the word no that made it personal to me it means I believe that that means that's mine when are we going to believe it when are we going to believe it and just say thank you Lord remember the Bible study Saturday come be with us father we commit everything into your hands now to just to be with the people on the way home take care of give a journey Lord that's safe for everybody and Open the Eyes of our hearts that we may see you we love you we thank you in Jesus name amen you're dismissed amen there are something
