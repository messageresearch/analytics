[1:22] yeah I guess all
[1:24] right all right July
[1:27] the 16th we'll let Louis do that now put
[1:31] on your calendars on the 14th of
[1:35] July that
[1:37] com
[1:41] L July the 14th on a Friday night at
[1:44] brother Tim H Church we're doing a
[1:46] special service and I'm doing the
[1:48] service starts at 7:30 if anybody wants
[1:50] to come so July the
[1:54] 14th it was suppos have been today but
[1:56] we changed it he wanted to do it on a
[1:58] special night where a lot of the
[1:59] ministers from around there could come
[2:04] so and we can't do it on Saturday night
[2:07] because they're having a a baby shower I
[2:10] mean not baby shower Lord bless you
[2:12] having a wedding shower for Andrew
[2:14] Glover and is new bride to be so hope
[2:19] it's not a baby and it's not a baby
[2:20] shower if you anybody sees it's not a
[2:22] baby shower it is a wedding household
[2:26] shower wedding shower householder
[2:30] yes household shower that's correct all
[2:33] right so now let's read this in the
[2:35] fifth seal when he had opened the fifth
[2:37] seal now remember all the combat Beast
[2:39] are gone so in other
[2:42] words we brother Brown says the Holy
[2:45] Ghost leades the Earth well now we know
[2:46] for a fact that the Holy Ghost leaves
[2:48] the Earth as we're going to be talking
[2:49] about today about this afternoon about
[2:54] theophanes and stuff like that it's
[2:55] going to you got to take that onion peel
[2:58] and you got to peel it back and the Holy
[3:00] Ghost you got to run it through your
[3:02] Holy Ghost filter which can't be
[3:04] different from mine but you got to run
[3:05] it through that and then we have to see
[3:10] that this is a natural
[3:14] happening this is a spiritual
[3:17] happening right and it's definitely
[3:20] spiritual because it's in another
[3:21] dimension these people that is talking
[3:23] to are already dead they're over in
[3:26] another dimension right
[3:28] okay excuse me actually John was caught
[3:31] up into another dimension I believe to
[3:33] see all this so he he's in a vision so
[3:35] he's in another dimension in a vision
[3:38] watching what's going on so um uh this
[3:42] is a supernatural happening it but it's
[3:44] going to be a total natural happening
[3:47] once we leave so when when I say that
[3:49] the Holy Ghost left the Earth then don't
[3:51] think that that there's not any Holy
[3:53] Ghost left the Holy Ghost for the
[3:55] Gentiles right the Gentile part of the
[3:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost in there
[4:01] soul is gone no other Gentile be saved
[4:05] right here we're looking at this right
[4:07] here this now right here foreal yes
[4:09] that's when we take a Rapture that's
[4:11] when the word's made manifest and we
[4:13] take a Rapture which is we Gentile
[4:16] Nations not
[4:20] the I want to say Jewish but it it's
[4:23] really there's going to be Jews in here
[4:25] but what I'm saying is when I say that
[4:27] uh you know brother R talking about
[4:28] theophanies and he and you got to be
[4:30] careful and watch because we're going to
[4:32] talk about this afternoon brother R
[4:34] talks about two Li two lives not two
[4:37] lives two lives l i f e s two lives that
[4:41] we are U that we're dealing with here so
[4:44] we'll continue on that we don't have two
[4:47] lives we have two lives there's two life
[4:50] forms that are
[4:51] working u in the Earth but when he had
[4:54] opened the fifth
[4:56] seal the Holy Ghost is gone for the
[4:58] Gentile dispensation
[5:00] but now what happens the Holy Ghost
[5:01] comes right back down in the Jewish
[5:05] dispensation the 3 and 1/2 years are the
[5:09] 1260 days and I was going to write that
[5:13] down I got my pins up yonder so I'm
[5:16] going to still use the board today if
[5:17] that's all
[5:19] right I guess not y'all sleep can you
[5:22] hear me yeah yeah okay yes yeah thank
[5:25] you
[5:28] anyway what was I going to write 126
[5:32] thank you thank you yeah thank you
[5:35] that's why I have backup brother I'm
[5:36] telling
[5:41] you cuz during that 1260 days what's
[5:44] going to happen here see we're going to
[5:45] narrow this thing down when he had
[5:47] opened the fifth seal I saw under the
[5:49] altar The Souls of them that were slain
[5:51] for the word of God and for the
[5:53] testimony which they held which was what
[5:55] which was the 6 and2 million Jews that
[5:58] were killed under I and Hitler and going
[6:01] on back to Christ time okay is that all
[6:05] right okay all right now what started
[6:08] the ball rolling I was thinking day I
[6:10] need to bring this in but remember when
[6:12] when they said let his blood be on us
[6:16] and our children the Jews said crucify
[6:18] him let his blood be on us the people
[6:20] standing there in
[6:22] ad30 getting ready to crucify
[6:24] Jesus and our children so you got this
[6:28] that spoke all when they spoke that a
[6:30] thunder went off in heaven and that's
[6:32] what
[6:33] broke you all the seals BR yeah the
[6:35] seals broke down here but something
[6:37] broke this hadn't been written yet right
[6:40] this had not been written physically
[6:42] written John was had not been on patmas
[6:44] at the time that they said let his blood
[6:47] be on us and our children but God knew
[6:49] before the foundation of the world so he
[6:50] backed her up to his forn knowledge went
[6:54] ahead and wrote it knowing they were
[6:55] going to say it okay so that to me that
[6:58] makes pred ation and and poor knowledge
[7:00] and all that so simple is that he saw
[7:04] them stand one day and reject him let
[7:06] his blood be on us and our children so
[7:07] we already wrote it that's right
[7:10] okay cuz remember the children part is
[7:14] the on that's going to be giv white
[7:15] robes right right the children the CH
[7:19] they's blood be on us and our
[7:21] children but remember the prophet God
[7:23] told us that God blinded their eyes so
[7:26] they couldn't see the Messiah so that me
[7:28] and you could come in that Gap and that
[7:29] Danel 70 weeks of the of the seven
[7:31] Church ages
[7:33] okay that's how we came in but now so
[7:37] this is talking directly to the Jews but
[7:39] there is a supernatural spiritual
[7:41] Revelation in this that is far beyond
[7:44] just people killing and dying and saying
[7:46] they love the Lord and saying they do
[7:47] this okay so that's the onion peel the
[7:50] onion peel is yes there is a fifth seal
[7:54] Jew is going to be put into a place
[7:59] already now they're there right they're
[8:02] there now they weren't all they weren't
[8:04] there when John saw this so John is
[8:06] projected all the way to this end time
[8:10] right past the
[8:11] Rapture and what and he sees this all
[8:14] right and man has probed at this and
[8:16] many people talk about that being the
[8:18] the the Saints even brother vandom you
[8:20] can watch him he he leans a little bit
[8:22] toward that back in his earlier Ministry
[8:25] how long how long but he never says to
[8:26] avenge our blood right see that that's
[8:29] the difference cuz when cuz when brother
[8:31] Bram comes to the opening of the
[8:35] seals he says now I read this different
[8:39] now I read it different now he
[8:42] said avenge our blood it has nothing to
[8:45] do with the Christian a Christian would
[8:47] not say Lord when are you going to
[8:49] avenge me right no it was father forgive
[8:52] them they don't know what they're doing
[8:54] so that's not the spirit of Christ
[8:55] dwelling in the inside man right okay so
[8:58] that if you you look at these in the
[9:00] Bible there are certain
[9:01] keys that will tell you what the
[9:04] underlying meaning or the or the or the
[9:06] meaning that it's coming out of is that
[9:09] now we look but now look if we were to
[9:11] read this without any observation of the
[9:15] message or without the Holy Ghost you
[9:17] would think white robes you would think
[9:19] those would be s in people that's right
[9:21] right right we think and and many
[9:23] commentary if you read them go back oh
[9:25] these are the Saints these are the
[9:26] standing people cuz look white robes
[9:28] were given
[9:30] right not
[9:32] tra that's why the seals had to come to
[9:34] turn that thing around and line it back
[9:36] up to where it's supposed to go
[9:38] okay and they cried with a loud voice
[9:41] saying how long oh Lord holy and true
[9:43] dust thou not judge and avenge our blood
[9:45] on them that dwell on the earth now what
[9:48] are they doing they must be able to see
[9:50] back out of that Dimension over into
[9:52] this
[9:52] Dimension good L will
[9:56] you July the what did I say 14
[10:00] no 14th is when I'm going
[10:01] to 16th July 16th that's Sunday he
[10:04] teaches Sunday
[10:05] school
[10:08] okay if he's not here
[10:13] you you sing all way yeah you can say oh
[10:16] yeah no doubt no doubt you probably get
[10:19] a better response than I do from this
[10:23] grrip and the grip says
[10:26] amen we're listening and they cry with a
[10:29] loud voice saying how long the Lord holy
[10:31] and true now how
[10:33] long white robes were given under every
[10:36] one of them and it was said unto them
[10:38] that they should rest yet for a little
[10:42] season what a couple thousand years
[10:45] right okay rest for a couple thousand
[10:48] years cuz remember we got whatever time
[10:50] we get out of here the 1260 days are
[10:54] going to be these people right
[10:56] here okay until there fellow servants
[11:00] which is who if he's talking to Jews
[11:03] then he's talking to
[11:05] Jews okay right if if the fellow are if
[11:09] you're talking about if Jews are there
[11:11] then you're talking about Jewish people
[11:14] right what I'm saying is there's no way
[11:17] this fifth seal is going to break in the
[11:19] United States of
[11:20] America remember Israel you look at them
[11:24] coming back now they got to come back to
[11:25] the Homeland right the only place
[11:28] they're going to be to hear those two
[11:29] prophets has got to be in Jerusalem yes
[11:31] right go what God say he said I'm not
[11:34] even going to talk to you outside of the
[11:35] your outside of your
[11:37] land that's why when they were dispersed
[11:39] God quit doing with them they were
[11:41] dispersed all over the place God didn't
[11:43] you know why cuz he said he wouldn't
[11:44] that's right he said you congregate back
[11:47] come back to Israel and that's what
[11:49] they're doing now that's why they're all
[11:51] coming back like the brother said I mean
[11:53] you don't you just got you don't even
[11:55] have to really hardly prove that you're
[11:57] you know you Jew way back 20 Generations
[12:00] just as long as you can prove that then
[12:01] they'll give you automatic citizenship
[12:04] you know they want the Jews to come back
[12:06] why because God's got to sift out
[12:08] 144,000
[12:11] people
[12:12] okay so there's got to be they can't
[12:15] be you know all of all of Israel
[12:18] couldn't have 120,000 people in it
[12:22] there's got to be 144,000 that's going
[12:24] to accept the message out of all that
[12:27] couple of million people okay all right
[12:30] so until their fellow servants also and
[12:33] their Brethren their brothers that
[12:35] should be killed as they were should be
[12:38] fulfilled that's going to take the 1260
[12:40] days to fulfill that right all right so
[12:43] now so I think we've got the idea
[12:45] there's no combat Beast this is looking
[12:47] into another dimension white robes were
[12:49] given to a group of people that said
[12:52] avenge our blood that really didn't have
[12:54] the what we say brother Brown talks
[12:56] about the right attitude they didn't
[12:58] have the right attitude
[13:00] right all right but God promised them
[13:03] that he'd never forget them he promised
[13:06] he'd never leave them he said I'm
[13:08] married to you whether I divorced you or
[13:10] not at one time you were married to me
[13:11] but now you're going to have to take a
[13:13] different position okay you might have
[13:15] to take a different place all right
[13:17] because only in that
[13:19] City inside that four wall City the new
[13:23] city the New Jerusalem is going to be
[13:25] that 144,000 and us
[13:29] right okay not counting your Apostles
[13:31] and Prophets cuz everybody else going to
[13:34] live outside the city right I was
[13:36] thinking the other day you know we were
[13:37] talking
[13:38] about I think we're talking
[13:41] about camping uh somebody asked
[13:44] about the area of the
[13:47] Earth well if There's 7 billion people
[13:49] living on the earth now and we're not
[13:51] crowded sure certain places are but if
[13:53] you dispersed everybody out you wouldn't
[13:54] be crowded but four fifths of this world
[13:57] is water right right and I don't think
[14:00] it's what it was back before the flood
[14:02] so it's going to go back to big land
[14:03] masses and and and like somebody asked
[14:06] who was it somebody asked here about um
[14:09] that be no more they said something
[14:12] about ocean who was it somebody asked it
[14:15] try2 2y2 son yeah she was she was
[14:18] worried about there not being any ocean
[14:20] cuz the Bible say there' be more sea I
[14:22] said the Bible didn't say it wouldn't be
[14:23] no more ocean the Bible said it wouldn't
[14:25] be no more
[14:26] sea why
[14:30] exactly the Mediterranean Sea is right
[14:32] there and here's Jerusalem well now if
[14:34] that City pushes up it's 1500 miles just
[14:37] to come incompass the city well there'll
[14:39] be any more seity they can't not be any
[14:41] more ocean God created whales that's
[14:43] right and God created sharks and all
[14:47] that that's in the water he can't do
[14:48] away with it that's right so there'll be
[14:50] a lot of oceans but there'll be a lot of
[14:52] land mass but you got to think we're
[14:54] just talking about a small minute group
[14:56] of people think about all the children
[14:59] that's been killed before the age of
[15:01] accountability from the dawn of time to
[15:05] today right man you talking about
[15:07] billions of people there's billions of
[15:10] children that's just going to be given
[15:11] eternal life because they're children
[15:13] they didn't grow up all the way to to uh
[15:16] to make a choice that's right besides
[15:18] all these other ones you know besides
[15:20] all the ones that come to adul so it's a
[15:22] glorious
[15:25] thing and I'm not worried about it cuz
[15:28] God you how big to make the Earth before
[15:31] this thing even got started he's not
[15:33] going to have to go I think I might need
[15:35] to make that just a little no it's
[15:38] perfect it's exactly what he said he saw
[15:41] it that's the way it's going to be and I
[15:43] just rest assured that I got my space in
[15:45] the city that's all I'm worried about I
[15:47] got my space in the city I got okay me
[15:50] and Jim going to walk around in that
[15:51] City and we're going to have a house all
[15:53] right and then you do the same
[15:55] thing why I got off on I don't have a
[15:57] clue anyway
[16:01] but
[16:02] look Watch What Happens though now I
[16:04] want to look at something else we we
[16:06] were talking last Sunday about this
[16:08] little word called
[16:10] Grace now the grace of
[16:12] God is that he gives eternal life that
[16:15] somebody doesn't want it right to me
[16:18] that's I can't fathom that because I'm
[16:20] looking on this side seeing that I have
[16:22] to accept Christ died for me I have to
[16:24] accept the word of God that's written
[16:26] for me and I have to accept the Holy
[16:28] Ghost I have to ask him to come into my
[16:32] life he has to accept me and look at all
[16:36] these things we go through but these
[16:37] people
[16:39] died Jews that's
[16:42] it but they said they had one testimony
[16:44] were God's people that's right God cuz
[16:47] they know the Old Testament even though
[16:50] 6 and2 million people that that were
[16:52] Jews that were killed by Amman and
[16:54] Hitler I would say that they
[16:56] weren't they might have been some
[16:58] Christians in there well they're going
[16:59] to go in the sixth Dimension because
[17:00] they're Christian but the rest part of
[17:02] the Jews were just they were just
[17:05] Jews they were just Jews they we are the
[17:09] children of God they didn't they didn't
[17:11] deny who they were well they're going to
[17:12] be given white robes well now to me it
[17:15] would be unfair see that's why I said
[17:17] man could never ever ever come up with
[17:20] grave that's right because it's
[17:24] unmerited
[17:26] favor we put a merit on every everything
[17:30] come on people we're human yes we do
[17:33] I'll do something for you if you'll do
[17:35] something for me I'll do this for you if
[17:37] you'll do this for me or if you do
[17:38] something for me I feel obligated to do
[17:41] something for you right I feel like I
[17:44] owe you something well God give them
[17:46] white robes and didn't owe nobody
[17:49] nothing and they're just going to pop up
[17:51] one day and I mean pop up they're going
[17:53] to be coming up out of that
[17:55] Dimension and God's going to give them
[17:57] eternal life
[17:59] and they're probably going to be shocked
[18:00] but you know what inside they're going
[18:02] to say hey we're God's people he told us
[18:04] what we were he told us we were the
[18:06] chosen people amen so I mean that's just
[18:09] to me it's uh it's it's the it's the
[18:12] Apex of Grace it's this when we're
[18:15] talking about this fifth sixth and
[18:16] seventh seal we're talking right here
[18:19] we're up in The Headstone that's right
[18:21] cuz you'll not know way with that look
[18:23] at that right
[18:27] there now them je when they were alive
[18:29] they didn't have none of
[18:32] that it's me and me and me all three of
[18:35] us together whatever you do you you and
[18:38] you fine but me me and me that's a Jew
[18:40] just the way the Jews are but they had
[18:42] no brotherly kindness those Jews you're
[18:44] talking about are the ones that just
[18:45] followed the law yes and the ones that
[18:48] even didn't follow the
[18:50] law cuz their only testimony brother
[18:53] Brown said was that they were
[18:55] Jews that's to me is the grace that's
[18:57] the grace of God
[18:59] by
[19:00] bloodline but now I agree one thing for
[19:04] sure if you were a a murderer or a wher
[19:08] or you know I'm talking about those 6
[19:10] and a half million people that were
[19:11] killed during opman and Hitler remember
[19:13] they were in every Community around
[19:17] Germany Russia France the Jews were
[19:20] dispersed so they were out there doing
[19:22] business they were sure I'm sure that
[19:24] they they you know I maybe not all
[19:27] Orthodox when you when you look at Jews
[19:29] you think well well these Jews that
[19:30] looks just like us that don't care just
[19:32] like people don't care here right now I
[19:34] don't know about them that's not my
[19:36] business to know but maybe the ones that
[19:38] leaned a little more that did read the
[19:40] Torah but they remember one thing they
[19:41] denied the
[19:44] Messiah regardless of what level they
[19:46] were they denied that Jesus was Christ
[19:49] okay so high in the world the Bible says
[19:51] unless you believe that I am he you'll
[19:53] die in your sins that's right now they
[19:55] got to overcome that somewhere where
[19:57] right there where they overcome it
[19:58] that's right God said that's right I'm
[20:00] going to give them white robes it ain't
[20:01] none of your business it's not what you
[20:04] think it's not what I think I'm going to
[20:06] give them white Roes because you know
[20:07] why I'm going to give them white Roes
[20:08] I'm going to give them white Roes
[20:09] because you would have not got one if I
[20:12] hadn't blinded their eye am right you
[20:15] wouldn't have got yours if I hadn't done
[20:18] this that's right so guess what there's
[20:21] the grace and there's justification
[20:23] times two you see I got times two so
[20:26] this is justification here well what is
[20:29] baby form justification if we want to
[20:30] call it that forgiving you you P sins
[20:33] yeah throw them in the sea of God's
[20:35] gness right never to be remembered
[20:38] again he must going to have to do this
[20:40] to the same group of people to another
[20:41] group of people he's got to do it to the
[20:44] Jews cuz if he rememb sin that's the
[20:46] whole thing I want you to see if he
[20:48] remers sin he'd have to destroy it
[20:51] that's right he's
[20:54] just they even said he was judged dust
[20:58] thou not judge and avenge our blood on
[21:02] them that dwell on the earth in other
[21:03] words all them that are alive back up
[21:05] there in the first three dimension
[21:07] aren't you going to judge them he says
[21:08] hey he never even answers that
[21:11] question he's like ain't none of your
[21:14] business I'm going to give you white
[21:16] robes right and I'm not going to have to
[21:18] sit and write
[21:20] white you're going to know why cuz you
[21:22] were
[21:24] Jews and I said I'd never forget you
[21:28] yeah right that's right so that's his
[21:31] promise that he made he never forgive
[21:33] them right right that's kind of their
[21:36] reward eyes BL that is correct right and
[21:40] that's what we have to see that and we
[21:42] have to see that the reason that they
[21:44] were blinded is so that you and I could
[21:47] come to full Redemption cuz see they
[21:50] don't come to full Redemption right
[21:51] that's right their body is not changed
[21:54] until they get a white r you understand
[21:56] what I'm saying right so they don't come
[21:57] to full Redemption
[21:59] but we because he blinded their eyes and
[22:01] we are able to see the gospel New and
[22:04] Old
[22:05] Testament in its fullness we take a body
[22:09] chain amen and that's
[22:11] our star I guess you might want to say
[22:14] they get their star because they're
[22:15] supposed to go to hell but God gives
[22:17] them eternal life and puts them in an
[22:20] eternal Earth to live eternally amen all
[22:24] right and and I am saying this is what
[22:27] this is me I am saying saying that you
[22:29] and I are be able to talk to these
[22:31] people yes and tell them explain to them
[22:37] listen you're not we
[22:40] are we're going to know all things
[22:42] because we're the children of God that
[22:44] theophany of God is the mind of God
[22:46] comes right to us they don't have the
[22:48] mind of God like we do right that's
[22:50] right people this is reserved for his
[22:52] children
[22:53] amen this is all reserved for his
[22:55] children right those are not his
[22:57] children amen oh yeah yeah well yeah
[22:59] they are his children you understand but
[23:01] they're not his progyny that he did not
[23:03] take that old nature away from them and
[23:05] put his nature in and they became God on
[23:09] the earth in human flesh like me and you
[23:12] exactly they had to die right give their
[23:16] life under horrible
[23:18] cruelty wait for a little time and then
[23:21] give an eternal
[23:23] life over later on past the U past I
[23:28] Resurrection our change our Rapture then
[23:30] they get white robes and somewhere in
[23:32] there you can't read it but somewhere in
[23:33] there they got to get a body change
[23:35] because as we'll look this afternoon
[23:37] we're going to all walk on this Earth in
[23:39] human bodies amen right human flesh
[23:42] bodies is what we're going to walk
[23:43] around on this Earth Eternal everybody
[23:46] they won't be one that's down here
[23:47] that's trying to no everybody will have
[23:49] eternal life Body Spirit and soul but I
[23:52] do believe that we will be that message
[23:55] of cheer that brother Dale's talking
[23:56] about that that brother Brown's talking
[23:58] about
[23:59] first that message of cheer is going to
[24:01] be
[24:02] what teach 6 and2 million Jews how they
[24:06] rejected God Amen the New Testament they
[24:09] never read it cuz they don't believe it
[24:10] so just you can take all these things
[24:12] just sit down somebody under a tree and
[24:14] drink some good sweet iced
[24:16] tea yeah it's going to be in the South
[24:18] we're going to live in the south be
[24:20] South Israel or something I don't know
[24:23] we going have some sweet tee he said he
[24:24] give you the desire of your heart sweet
[24:26] teeth
[24:30] doesn't matter if you don't that's okay
[24:32] but but white roads were given under
[24:34] every one of them and it was sent unto
[24:36] them that they should yet rest for a
[24:39] little season until their fellow fellow
[24:41] servant and their Brethren that should
[24:42] be killed as they were should be
[24:44] fulfilled and we know when is that going
[24:45] to be fulfilled that's going to be
[24:48] fulfilled after that 1260 days that the
[24:52] two prophets are going to preach to the
[24:53] 144,000 to to to get them now now look
[24:57] they get the Holy Ghost on the Earth
[24:58] right before they die okay they're not
[25:01] like this group right here totally right
[25:04] right but there are still going to be
[25:05] Jews that are going to be killed that's
[25:07] right for the testimony that they hell
[25:09] for being Jews and then the 12 cuz you
[25:12] got to remember so you got to take that
[25:13] out of the
[25:14] equation I mean you have to put that in
[25:16] there but during that time that's why I
[25:18] wrote that during that time you got this
[25:19] going on the fifth seal
[25:23] now let's look for a few minutes at the
[25:25] part that we need to get and now we got
[25:28] to take the onion peel and push it back
[25:30] a little bit further because this is
[25:31] talking about me and you this is us
[25:34] number one is Grace we all need Grace
[25:36] you say you need Grace I thought the
[25:38] Bible said that the headstone would come
[25:41] crying what Grace Grace unto it Amazing
[25:46] Grace amen now Grace is good but Amazing
[25:51] Grace and you think well Grace is good
[25:54] but you just put that word amazing in it
[25:55] makes everything you know so more much
[25:57] more
[25:59] clear because it's not that it's not
[26:02] that it is Amazing Grace Grace is just
[26:04] Grace but it's amazing to who who given
[26:06] to amen it's amazing to me that's why
[26:10] that uh one know um John Newton wrote
[26:15] that that struck him I mean Amazing
[26:19] Grace how sweet this now just grace
[26:21] Amazing Grace how sweet this right so we
[26:23] look now that too though that once we've
[26:26] come through this now what we have to
[26:29] do we went through justification
[26:31] sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost and
[26:34] the word Made Alive and we're getting
[26:35] ready for a Rapture now I told you we
[26:37] got to lap back over you got one 2 3
[26:41] four then you got a
[26:43] Rapture no more Gentile five six and
[26:47] seven right
[26:49] right okay right but we' got a lap over
[26:53] we got to take these back over to here
[26:56] right for me you right cuz remember
[27:00] right here there's got to be something
[27:03] happening for a body chain
[27:10] right but remember just because you got
[27:13] the Holy Ghost just because you got the
[27:16] word just because you got even The
[27:18] Headstone that
[27:19] doesn't give you the right they have a
[27:23] body change on this side
[27:26] that on this side you understand
[27:28] them everybody with the Holy Ghost is
[27:30] going to get a body change everybody
[27:32] that's right even the ones giving
[27:34] eternal life is going to have a body
[27:35] change but they're going to get it layer
[27:37] that's right like the ones at the white
[27:38] throne and the foolish virgin and all
[27:40] that all right but you and I are going
[27:42] to have to bring this thing back over
[27:47] here cuz here we have
[27:49] to put three or four scriptures together
[27:51] we which are alive and remain so there's
[27:53] got to be an alive and remain over right
[27:57] here
[27:58] okay and if you're alive and remain that
[28:00] means death has been destroyed in your
[28:02] body
[28:04] right and you have been
[28:06] changed we which are alive and remain
[28:08] shall not hinder or prevent those which
[28:10] are asleep for the trumpet of God shall
[28:12] sign right dead in Christ shall rise
[28:15] first right here dead in Christ shall
[28:18] rise first well they're going to rise
[28:20] first I'm going to make a big one cuz
[28:22] that's a lot of them do mean this is the
[28:23] little one is us then we which are alive
[28:26] and rain will be changed
[28:29] why I said the next thing in order is
[28:30] not the Rapture
[28:33] right you can't have a Rapture without a
[28:36] resurrection first so we got to get the
[28:38] dead Saints out of the ground first
[28:40] first thing we got to do is is preach
[28:42] the gospel come to a position that Jesus
[28:44] stood one day and said I am the
[28:46] resurrection and
[28:48] life and Lazarus not Lazarus but
[28:52] Paul bring your people irenius Martin
[28:55] Columba Luther Wesley
[28:59] bring your
[29:01] people now I don't know if Paul's going
[29:04] to resurrect and come here I think he'll
[29:06] stay where he was at each one of them
[29:08] has a group of people like you know
[29:10] brother brandom's people were all from
[29:13] all over the world but most of them were
[29:15] from here so we they may gather here who
[29:16] cares it doesn't really
[29:18] matter but it's one thing for sure we're
[29:20] going to see the dead Among Us yes the
[29:25] ones that died Among Us I'll promise you
[29:27] we'll see them
[29:28] okay man we'll see them spiritually
[29:31] we'll see them because you're not going
[29:32] to I don't believe everybody's going to
[29:34] see them does that give us the Fai to
[29:36] the I think that gives us that
[29:39] last um you know you're in your your
[29:44] stretch you're in your race where the
[29:45] last guy grabbed the Baton that's the
[29:48] last you know we know it's coming once
[29:50] you see the dead among us then the word
[29:53] of God has been made so real the son of
[29:56] man is back in power the
[29:58] Resurrection is now not see now see the
[30:03] resurrection is a process we know the
[30:04] Rapture is a process I don't want you to
[30:06] get me wrong cuz somebody the other day
[30:08] was talking about the Rapture and said
[30:09] well it's a process it is a process but
[30:11] there's one day that it's going to
[30:12] culminate that's right there's one day
[30:15] we're going to take a Rapture that's
[30:16] right all right and we know the Rapture
[30:18] starts when you get to New Birth that's
[30:20] why I saying you you you say certain
[30:21] things to to people that are unlearned
[30:24] and they go well why why did you say the
[30:26] resurrection that brother B said the
[30:27] rapture is already taking
[30:30] place well I want to ask you a
[30:32] question do you feel any younger than
[30:35] you did 6 months
[30:37] ago in your soul you should but not in
[30:41] your natural body so we got to take that
[30:45] thinking though and flip it
[30:47] over right you know what it's a carnal
[30:50] mind it's our carnal mind that's our
[30:52] worst problem our caral mind is the
[30:54] enmity that's right that I'm getting old
[30:59] but I'm supposed to be in a raptor see
[31:01] the doubt see the doubt that comes in
[31:03] your mind don't tell me it don't yeah it
[31:05] comes in your mind man sometimes
[31:07] sometimes I doubt sometimes I worry no
[31:09] the person that stands with that faith
[31:11] has got to be standing there just like
[31:13] and when he speaks it's God people amen
[31:15] cuz God can only resurrect amen
[31:18] thousands hundreds of thousands of
[31:20] people from Paul's age all the way up to
[31:22] brother
[31:23] around so it's not going to be just well
[31:26] I hope it works today
[31:28] no no there's going to be a time that
[31:30] you come to that just going it's going
[31:32] to click right into
[31:33] motion it's not going to be one
[31:36] person it's going to be a many member
[31:38] body that's going to come to a place may
[31:40] not be but 12 who knows amen but the
[31:44] word preached in a church is going to
[31:47] bring the people to an expectation
[31:50] correct we're expecting it because what
[31:52] you're
[31:52] saying we must come under expectation
[31:56] but the whole problem with this whole
[31:58] message is is that we've had these
[32:00] doctrines over here we've had these
[32:01] doctrines over here we've had these
[32:03] ideas over here we've had these ideas
[32:05] over here right that's all Satan's got
[32:08] to do get you one word off that's right
[32:10] right you missed the mark That's What
[32:12] sin is but if we pull these things
[32:14] that's why that that I that I
[32:18] like um
[32:20] teaching because to me it answers my
[32:24] question I mean sure it was it's great
[32:27] to go on an anointing and just feel good
[32:29] and and you know people tell you about
[32:31] yourself and that's good that's
[32:33] okay but when somebody can answer a
[32:35] question of mind to me what that does is
[32:37] it keeps lining that thing up cuz
[32:40] remember I don't there was never in
[32:43] Jesus's mind he never doubted who he was
[32:47] amen never doubted who he was he knew
[32:51] who he was now he knew when he was a
[32:53] human when he had to eat and do his
[32:56] business and you know watch and do all
[32:58] the human thing but when he stand there
[33:00] and it's just like the brother said the
[33:02] other day in New Mexico which was really
[33:04] good you know Legion run out there that
[33:06] Legion he said we are many so it wasn't
[33:08] just one demon thousands of demons ain't
[33:10] that one man he had allowed all these
[33:13] things to come in him but when Jesus
[33:14] foot stepped on that
[33:16] land the Bible says when Jesus EX in
[33:19] other words exited the boat and when he
[33:21] stepped on that land see we we talk
[33:24] about the pop and making a possession
[33:27] and we talk about our Footprints is
[33:28] possession but when Jesus's foot stepped
[33:30] on that land what was he saying this
[33:34] place is now mine this place is mine you
[33:37] said well Jesus had went all way around
[33:39] the world yes he has he said when the
[33:41] gospel is preached to Every Nation it
[33:44] don't take but one person from North
[33:45] Korea to step into North Korea and he
[33:48] has possessed the land for the Lord
[33:50] Jesus Christ amen so when Jesus stepped
[33:53] his foot the first thing the demon does
[33:54] will come run into him and said why have
[33:56] you come to torment us before our time
[34:00] they knew who he was thou Son of
[34:03] God and the Pharisees call him a a devil
[34:06] and the devil calling him God why
[34:08] because it was a possession Jesus didn't
[34:10] it's like the brother said Jesus do and
[34:12] stand on the boat and he saw Legion and
[34:14] you know they said he'd tear
[34:16] chains RI things apart cut his you know
[34:19] nobody could contain this man and Jesus
[34:22] didn't see him obviously he was coming
[34:24] up on the boat and he was looking at him
[34:26] mhm
[34:28] Jesus didn't go I wonder if today I
[34:33] can I mean he's many you I'm one I I
[34:36] don't know no the Bible says he he got
[34:40] out of the boat he just got out of the
[34:41] boat and that's what you and I got to do
[34:43] go through the Earth get out of the boat
[34:45] that's right get out of the boat and go
[34:46] do what we're supposed to
[34:48] do that's our problem sometimes we
[34:54] hesitate those who hesitate wait but we
[34:57] don't want to hesitate okay so now let's
[35:00] get this one comment and I want you to
[35:02] think about chewing it for the rest of
[35:03] the
[35:04] week we're talking about
[35:07] Grace now see to
[35:10] me let me get this right to me what I'm
[35:13] going to talk about this afternoon is
[35:15] sure it's the grace of God but that's
[35:16] eternal life
[35:18] right which is total Grace but it's not
[35:21] Grace to him he don't need Grace that's
[35:23] right eternal life doesn't need Grace
[35:26] eternal life is Grace that's right all
[35:28] right but it's not only that because you
[35:32] and I and let me here I'm going to say
[35:35] something and you're going to have to
[35:36] think about it for a minute how hard is
[35:39] it for when Jesus said I go to my father
[35:42] and your father my God and your God I
[35:44] come from God and go to God and I'm
[35:46] going to send the Holy Ghost back and go
[35:47] into your soul all right he told us that
[35:50] right that's right he was adamant about
[35:52] that I'm going to come back and I'm
[35:54] going to enter in you and I'm going to
[35:57] make you my children okay that's right
[36:00] now why can't we believe it for
[36:03] them this is the hard
[36:05] part it's harder for me to understand
[36:08] how God's going to change my body
[36:10] because of what I live in and what I do
[36:12] in it than it is my
[36:14] soul cuz my soul can feed on the word of
[36:17] God and just pour it in and just get
[36:20] anointed and just feel good and then
[36:22] Monday morning
[36:28] man I don't know what I got that's right
[36:31] come on now
[36:32] really and the holy go and the Holy
[36:35] Ghost inside of you that theophany 18
[36:37] years
[36:38] old 20 years old the 90y old woman that
[36:41] got eternal life from Brother R meeting
[36:43] man she was she was happy you know why
[36:46] she was happy cuz she lived in a 90y old
[36:47] body for a long time for 90
[36:50] years so what I'm saying is is that this
[36:53] is to me if you want to say an easy and
[36:54] a hard this is the easy part right cuz
[36:57] once your Nature's dead and you get the
[36:59] new birth you're you're you're in Christ
[37:01] you're a new Creator new creature all
[37:04] things have become new you don't smoke
[37:05] cuss drink do all things you used to do
[37:07] everything's lined up I'll read it this
[37:09] afternoon everything's lined up that new
[37:12] nature is
[37:14] gone that's true all down Through the
[37:17] Ages they had that but they never pick a
[37:20] body
[37:21] CH never from Paul's age till now nobody
[37:25] has took a body change right right
[37:30] why it's all
[37:34] there all the word was there the word
[37:37] revealed the word revealed so first
[37:41] revelation for a body
[37:43] change is that fifth
[37:46] s that's not justification for your soul
[37:48] your soul should already be justified
[37:50] that's
[37:51] right what is
[37:54] Justified you're just
[37:58] God has counted you just will I do
[38:02] this God don't have a list
[38:05] no now see he does here because this is
[38:08] baby for justification you justify it
[38:10] here if you continue on you and you know
[38:13] 10 years you stay in just I doubt it cuz
[38:16] remember you get Justified your past
[38:18] sins are chopped off then your sins
[38:21] continue and they are a record made and
[38:24] you're a sinner you're a sinner and to
[38:27] you're right here right J Judas is
[38:30] carried got to right here and he was the
[38:32] son of prediction so you're not going to
[38:34] be any different you see what I'm
[38:36] talking about yes cuz justification cuts
[38:39] off your past sins yeah all that stuff
[38:40] you used to do you don't you don't it
[38:43] don't say you don't do them anymore this
[38:45] is where that comes in this right here
[38:47] is is they're cut off and never to be
[38:49] remembered the sheet that used to have
[38:51] words on it now what okay from here back
[38:54] right but from here forward starts a new
[38:58] chapter and you are condemned by that
[39:02] but now this justification we're talking
[39:04] about here these people are so
[39:07] Justified to God is going to chop off
[39:10] their past sins and give them eternal
[39:11] life but now he is not going to changed
[39:13] their body because they came to a
[39:16] position that's right he's changing
[39:19] their body because you give them the
[39:20] Holy Ghost somewhere down the road not
[39:23] in not on Earth not on the time they
[39:26] listen the time they were living
[39:28] that's right we got to talk about now
[39:29] the only way you can take a body change
[39:32] is
[39:33] living what we're talking about today
[39:35] that's right right see everybody else is
[39:37] dead Paul cannot take a body change
[39:39] until we until we get him out of the
[39:40] ground that's right right okay so we're
[39:43] talking about now that's right so we've
[39:45] got to come under a justification
[39:46] brother said there's a just there's a
[39:48] higher form of justification there's a
[39:49] higher form of sanctification this
[39:51] highest form of justification is it's
[39:52] the real you didn't do
[39:55] it the real you didn't do it we'll read
[39:57] this afternoon brother round he boy I I
[40:00] got one quote that I really lie but we
[40:02] we got time's over go go
[40:08] go but the fifth seal Sixth Seal and
[40:11] seventh seal Revelation is what's going
[40:12] to change our body 1 through four is a
[40:17] foundation that many people will come to
[40:19] but lot most
