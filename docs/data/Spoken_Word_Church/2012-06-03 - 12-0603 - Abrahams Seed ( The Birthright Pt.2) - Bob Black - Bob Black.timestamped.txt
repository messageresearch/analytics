[0:00] let's get started
[0:02] um
[0:04] let's turn to
[0:07] matthew 1.
[0:21] and read through a few verses
[0:24] just to kind of set the context
[0:30] uh because we've been going down through
[0:32] the uh the genealogy of um
[0:35] of
[0:36] the book of the generation of jesus
[0:37] christ
[0:38] the son of david the son of abraham
[0:41] and um
[0:43] kind of going through the story of the
[0:44] birthright
[0:46] and uh the promises of abraham that and
[0:49] the story of how they're uh
[0:51] what i'm going is
[0:53] where
[0:54] how the birthright was given to joseph
[0:57] and ephraim and
[0:59] the
[1:00] the promise of the messiah went through
[1:02] judah and how that all came about
[1:05] so let's just read a few verses just to
[1:06] set the context the book of the
[1:08] generation of jesus christ the son of
[1:10] david
[1:11] the son of abraham
[1:13] abraham began isaac
[1:15] and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat
[1:18] judas and his brethren
[1:20] and judas beget ferez and zara of tamar
[1:23] and forest we get israel and israel
[1:26] israel to get around and everyone began
[1:28] i mean adam and eve that we're getting
[1:30] their song and their song to get
[1:31] summoned
[1:33] and you know i was researching uh just
[1:36] looking at how to pronounce some of
[1:37] these names and
[1:38] each of us have our own little
[1:40] uh
[1:41] you know we've heard the pronunciation
[1:43] all our lives but
[1:45] come to find out we pronounce a lot of
[1:46] these names wrong so
[1:49] like levi the chronic the correct
[1:51] pronunciation for levi is actually libby
[1:53] and um
[1:55] the if you see a j at the beginning like
[1:57] jehovah gyra is pronounced
[2:01] instead of jehovah gyra so um don't get
[2:03] too hung up on the pronunciation if i
[2:05] mispronounce something wrong
[2:06] this
[2:07] you'll never know
[2:12] besides you do such a fabulous job
[2:14] bless your heart
[2:18] so let's turn to
[2:20] oh
[2:21] revelation
[2:22] last time we talked about um
[2:26] that we were kind of talking about the
[2:27] different components of the birthright
[2:29] leading up to
[2:30] how it was the sector was given to judah
[2:32] and the birthright was given to joseph
[2:34] what part of the birthright was given or
[2:36] what what constituted that what was what
[2:39] was given to joseph and uh what was
[2:41] given to judah
[2:43] so um
[2:44] we kind of were talking about how
[2:46] the birthright spoke of a
[2:48] kingdom of kings
[2:50] greece um and a multitude of nations
[2:53] and uh so now we're going to talk about
[2:55] the how it's part part of the the
[2:58] promise is that we will become if you're
[3:00] part of that kingdom you're priests
[3:02] so let's turn to revelations 20
[3:05] verse 6.
[3:18] and that says blessed and holy is he
[3:21] that have part in the first resurrection
[3:24] on such the second death hath no power
[3:27] but they shall be priests of god and of
[3:29] christ
[3:31] and to reign with him a thousand years
[3:33] so we have a promise
[3:35] that if we're part of this spiritual
[3:37] kingdom
[3:38] that the messiah came to set up that we
[3:40] will be part of the promises that will
[3:42] be priests of god
[3:44] there's other scriptures that says we'll
[3:46] be uh king there will be kings and we
[3:48] talked about that last time how the
[3:50] promises that would be kings
[3:53] how we have um
[3:55] dominion over over the world the flesh
[3:57] and the devil
[3:59] and um
[4:02] and so part of the promise is that is
[4:04] the promise that will be priests
[4:06] and this there's a lot of disagreement
[4:08] about if you look at what like for
[4:10] example the mormon church says that the
[4:12] the priesthood was not part of the
[4:14] birthright
[4:16] but scofield's notes on genesis 25 31
[4:19] talking about esau selling his
[4:20] birthright says that
[4:22] the part of the birthright was the
[4:24] pre-aaronic priesthood so before the
[4:27] before uh the firstborn was taken
[4:31] we will look we'll go through the
[4:32] history for in a second of the how the
[4:34] levitical priesthood came to be but
[4:37] you'll remember that
[4:39] the firstborn was chosen by god and then
[4:41] god took the levites instead of the
[4:43] firstborn to serve him in the temple and
[4:46] before that
[4:47] the firstborn was the priest of their
[4:49] family
[4:50] and
[4:51] so i kind of just had some notes from
[4:53] clark's commentary on the bible agrees
[4:55] with this jameson faucet brown bible
[4:57] commentary there was a medieval jewish
[4:59] commentary named rashi that was very
[5:02] popular that um says that the priesthood
[5:04] that the jews rely heavily on that the
[5:07] priesthood of the family was part of the
[5:08] birthright and jews to this day it holds
[5:10] strongly that the priesthood was part of
[5:12] the birth of the priesthood of the
[5:14] family was part of the birthright
[5:17] um
[5:18] so
[5:19] and and just looking at the promises in
[5:21] revelation speaks of um that will that
[5:24] will we are priests of god and of christ
[5:27] and brother ram and israel in the church
[5:29] he said the father was the priest of the
[5:31] house and the old sanctuary the old time
[5:34] the father always was the priest and he
[5:36] had to watch over his household
[5:38] would have changed today
[5:40] the kids watched over the dead in the
[5:42] modern world
[5:43] but the father was to watch up his house
[5:45] he killed the lamb he took the hyssop
[5:47] put it on the doors on a little and that
[5:49] was their protection
[5:50] all right they stayed in i can see the
[5:52] rest of them going frolicking and
[5:54] carrying on saying look at that bunch of
[5:56] fanatics
[5:57] oh with an old sheep blood on the door
[5:59] trying to say this hooker's pocket
[6:00] something's going to happen
[6:02] but it did
[6:04] why god said so it always is the truth
[6:06] when god says sir
[6:08] and then god's provided a way he said
[6:11] these uh
[6:13] still talking about putting the blood
[6:14] over the little of the door and there
[6:15] that night out and let's take a little
[6:17] drama
[6:18] i can notice the father of course and
[6:20] the old testament was the priest of the
[6:22] house now he's the figurehead
[6:24] now he goes down and he puts on the door
[6:26] and the little post and then when it
[6:28] comes about night i can see all the
[6:29] young girls down there
[6:31] come out tell the hebrew girls come on
[6:33] we're going out to dance
[6:35] why they say we can't go we're under the
[6:37] blood what a type we're coming in god's
[6:39] provided way
[6:42] and god's provided way in 1953 he said i
[6:45] can hear the priest of the family the
[6:47] father said
[6:48] there's the death angel sweeping the
[6:50] land now too late now
[6:52] and directly i can see him go dip down
[6:54] on into a valley here scream come up
[6:56] from that house
[6:58] the sun was dead away he went directly
[7:00] here he comes right down to another
[7:02] house again
[7:03] goes in the big black wings close in
[7:05] around the house
[7:06] a scream goes up comes up the sun is
[7:09] dead
[7:10] i can hit a little boy say daddy take
[7:12] another look be sure the blood's on
[7:13] there yes sir
[7:14] so you can see how that
[7:17] that so many so many types there now
[7:19] that
[7:20] the father
[7:22] the the man of the family is supposed to
[7:24] be the priest and and if we're part of
[7:26] the kingdom we're supposed to be
[7:28] we offer up just like the priests in the
[7:30] temple offered up incense before god we
[7:32] offer up our prayers and our
[7:34] thanksgiving our songs
[7:36] um
[7:38] so a history of the
[7:39] how the levitical priesthood started um
[7:42] in exodus 13 2 and i'll just read it off
[7:45] for you
[7:46] quickly uh
[7:47] god says sanctifying to me all the first
[7:49] born whatsoever openeth the womb among
[7:51] the children of israel both a man and a
[7:53] beast that is mine
[7:55] and we could go into how the firstborn
[7:57] had to be
[7:59] had to be redeemed by uh he talked about
[8:01] the firstborn mule had to be redeemed by
[8:03] a lamb and the firstborn is must be
[8:06] redeemed just like we have to be
[8:07] redeemed by christ
[8:09] and then
[8:10] so the firstborn was taken by god and
[8:13] then god later on he said in exodus 13
[8:16] 12 17 thou shalt
[8:18] that thou shalt set apart unto the lord
[8:20] all that openeth the matrix and every
[8:22] first lane that cometh of a beast which
[8:23] thou hast the male shall be the lords
[8:27] and every first thing of an ass thou
[8:28] shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou not
[8:30] redeem it then thou shalt break his neck
[8:32] and all the firstborn of man among thy
[8:33] children shalt thou redeem and it shall
[8:35] be when thy son asketh thee in time to
[8:37] come saying what is this that thou shalt
[8:39] say unto him by strength of hand the
[8:40] lord brought us out from egypt from the
[8:42] house of bondage
[8:43] and it came to pass when favor would
[8:45] hardly let us go that the lord slew all
[8:47] the firstborn in the land of egypt both
[8:48] the first one of man and the firstborn
[8:50] of beast
[8:51] therefore i sacrificed to the lord all
[8:52] that openeth the matrix being males but
[8:54] all the firstborn of my children are
[8:56] redeemed
[8:57] and there shall be a token
[8:59] upon thy hand for frontless between our
[9:01] eyes
[9:02] for by strength of hand the lord brought
[9:04] us forth out of egypt and
[9:06] then in exodus 32
[9:09] 26-29
[9:11] uh this is when
[9:13] moses stood in the gate of the camp and
[9:15] said who was on the lord's side let him
[9:17] come unto me and all the sons of levi
[9:19] gather themselves together unto him
[9:21] and he said unto them thus saith the
[9:23] lord god of israel put every man his
[9:24] sword by his side and go in and out from
[9:26] gate to gate throughout the canvas lay
[9:28] every man his brother and his companion
[9:30] and every man his neighbor and the
[9:31] children of levi i did according to the
[9:33] word of moses and their fellow the
[9:34] people that date about 3 000 men
[9:37] so because of what they did and they
[9:39] were separated they stood by when god
[9:41] said who's on the lord's side the levite
[9:43] all of levi stood with the lord and so
[9:45] they were separated to serve the lord in
[9:47] the temple
[9:48] and instead of the first one of every
[9:50] family in numbers 3 12 13 and i behold i
[9:54] have taken the levites from among the
[9:55] children of israel
[9:57] instead of all the firstborn that
[9:58] openeth the matrix among the children of
[10:00] israel therefore the levi shall be mine
[10:03] because of the firstborn of mine from
[10:05] the day that i smoked all the firstborn
[10:07] and the land of egypt i hallowed unto me
[10:09] all the firstborn in israel both man and
[10:11] beast to mind shall they be i am the
[10:13] lord
[10:14] in revelation 1 6 it says
[10:16] and have made us kings and priests unto
[10:18] god and his father
[10:20] to him be glory and dominion forever and
[10:22] ever so last time we talked about how
[10:24] the birthright the spiritual birthright
[10:26] is the is the new birth
[10:28] so being kings and priests is part of
[10:30] being part of this new kingdom and the
[10:32] revelation of jesus christ he said and
[10:34] made us priests
[10:36] yes priests unto him offering the
[10:38] spiritual praise of sanctified lips
[10:40] spending our lives as a sweet offering
[10:41] unto him worshiping him in spirit and in
[10:43] truth
[10:44] interceding and petitioning priests and
[10:47] kings unto our god
[10:50] when faith is the substance he said
[10:52] our bodies are groaning and we have an
[10:54] inheritance
[10:55] and we're children now heirs of the
[10:57] kingdom of my kings and priests unto god
[10:59] offering spiritual sacrifices
[11:01] what does a priest do to make a
[11:03] sacrifice what is a spiritual sacrifice
[11:05] that's what these sons and daughters do
[11:07] which are kings and priests
[11:09] yet not in full possession but they're
[11:10] making sacrifices
[11:12] offering to god spiritual sacrifices the
[11:15] fruits of our lips giving praise to him
[11:17] fruits of our lips
[11:19] you say brother branham i just don't
[11:21] feel like praising him
[11:22] that's the time to make the sacrifice
[11:24] praise him anyhow kings and priests sons
[11:26] and daughters offering spiritual
[11:28] sacrifice the fruits of our lips giving
[11:30] praise unto his name
[11:34] in the end time evangelism
[11:36] 1962 he said feed us with that hidden
[11:39] manner that you said in the bible was
[11:40] given that laid back
[11:42] just for the priesthood only and we are
[11:45] taught that we are priests of god
[11:47] offering spiritual sacrifice that is the
[11:49] fruits of our lips
[11:50] giving praise to his to his name now we
[11:53] pray that you will bless us in the
[11:54] further part of this service
[11:56] breaking the bread of life to us
[12:01] so you can see how that
[12:03] the priests offered sacrifice and they
[12:05] could partake of the um
[12:07] the the manna and the
[12:14] cakes that were reserved just for the
[12:16] priests
[12:18] let's see
[12:23] another thing
[12:24] i like this in the in the old in the in
[12:27] solomon's temple there was a in the
[12:29] outer court it was a set of steps that
[12:31] led up into the inner court and the
[12:33] priests part of what they did was
[12:35] they had a
[12:36] choir and they would line up along that
[12:39] the steps and seeing as you went into
[12:41] the uh the the intercourse
[12:43] and um
[12:46] let's see in first chronicles 5 12 14 it
[12:48] talks about it and
[12:50] also the levites which were the singers
[12:52] all of them of asaph of him and the
[12:54] jedison with their sons and their
[12:56] brethren being arrayed in white linen
[12:57] having symbols and salters and harps
[12:59] stood at the east end of the altar
[13:02] and with them in 120 priests sounding
[13:04] with trumpets it came even to pass as
[13:07] the trumpeters and singers were as one
[13:08] to make one sound
[13:10] to be heard and praising and thanking
[13:12] the lord and when they lifted up their
[13:14] voice with the trumpets and symbols and
[13:16] instruments and of music and praise the
[13:18] lord saying for he is good for his mercy
[13:20] endureth forever that then the house was
[13:22] filled with a cloud even the house of
[13:24] the lord
[13:25] and uh
[13:27] i was reading where josephus talked
[13:28] about how uh
[13:30] the
[13:31] the old writings that he had read of
[13:33] people that had went into the into
[13:34] solomon's temple said it was just so
[13:37] awe-inspiring to come in and see the
[13:38] stingers all all dressed in their
[13:40] priestly garments and uh
[13:43] just such a holy atmosphere and that's
[13:45] the same kind of holy atmosphere that we
[13:47] should
[13:48] create
[13:49] in our worship just like those priests
[13:51] did
[13:54] so that's the that's kind of an overview
[13:56] of the priesthood and uh think of this
[13:58] in the context of the generations of
[14:01] jesus christ and how the um
[14:04] how this fits into the promise
[14:06] and uh the next part is uh the promise
[14:09] of many nations
[14:10] and after after i kind of go into this
[14:12] overview of where we're going we'll dive
[14:15] into uh
[14:16] last time we talked about abraham we'll
[14:18] start looking at isaac and then look at
[14:20] how the uh
[14:22] look at the promises that that jacob
[14:25] the blessings of jacob upon each of the
[14:27] 12 sons
[14:29] and how that how they were placed
[14:32] according to their promise
[14:34] so the promise of many nations
[14:36] was uh one of the the blessing that
[14:39] jacob gave to ephraim was that he would
[14:41] be a multitude of nations so when you
[14:43] think of the birthright think of the um
[14:46] the birthright that was promised to
[14:48] ephraim think about this this promise of
[14:50] a multitude of nations
[14:53] uh judah was gonna bring the messiah but
[14:56] uh ephraim through through joseph and
[14:58] ephraim was to come a multitude of
[15:00] nations
[15:01] um
[15:02] and
[15:04] let's see
[15:08] let's go to
[15:09] let's look at genesis chapter 17.
[15:29] but there's a natural multitude of
[15:31] nations and a spiritual multitude of
[15:33] nations so we kind of looked at both of
[15:34] those
[15:37] 17 verses 5 and 6.
[15:41] this is god's promise when he changes
[15:42] his name from abram to abraham verse 5
[15:45] neither shall thy name anymore be called
[15:47] abram but thy name shall be abraham
[15:50] for a father of many nations have i made
[15:52] thee and i will make the exceeding
[15:55] fruitful and i will make nations of thee
[15:57] and king shall come out of thee
[16:00] so now let's go to
[16:02] god's promise to jacob
[16:04] in genesis 35
[16:08] reverse a little
[16:22] start at verse 10
[16:25] and god said unto him thy name is jacob
[16:28] thy name shall not be called anymore
[16:30] jacob but israel shall be thy name and
[16:32] he called his name israel
[16:34] now he's going to reiterate his promise
[16:36] to abraham when he changed abraham's
[16:37] name
[16:38] and god said unto him i am god almighty
[16:40] be fruitful and multiply a nation
[16:43] and a company of nations shall be of
[16:44] thee
[16:45] and king shall come out of thy lords
[16:48] and it goes on to talk about the
[16:49] promises of the land
[16:51] until i see that it would be the land
[16:53] and and so forth but um
[16:55] so think about this in the context of
[16:57] where
[16:58] joseph's birthright
[17:01] and then uh let's go to genesis 48
[17:07] jacob's blessing to ephraim
[17:12] so remember god promised jacob that he
[17:14] would give him a nation he'd be the
[17:15] father of a nation and a company of
[17:17] nations
[17:18] the nation of judah and a company of
[17:20] nations of israel
[17:26] genesis 48
[17:27] 19.
[17:35] this is when
[17:36] jacob was blessing joseph's son and
[17:39] saying they're going to be part of my
[17:41] inheritance
[17:42] they're going to be named by my name
[17:45] and and uh and let's start at verse 18
[17:47] and joseph said unto his father not so
[17:49] my father for this is the firstborn
[17:51] because joseph crossed his hands
[17:53] and uh put that right hand upon his head
[17:56] and his father refused and said i know
[17:57] it my son i know it he also shall become
[17:59] a people
[18:00] and he also shall be great but truly his
[18:02] younger brother shall be greater than he
[18:05] and his seed shall become a multitude of
[18:07] nations that's his promise to ephraim a
[18:10] multitude of nations
[18:12] so in the natural after 25 years
[18:15] jacob goes down to egypt with 70 just 70
[18:18] souls
[18:20] and 210 years later
[18:23] it came out with um
[18:26] in exodus 12 37 it says they they came
[18:28] out with 600 000 on foot that were men
[18:31] besides children so if you extrapolate a
[18:33] lot of people have tried to figure out
[18:34] how many total people there were based
[18:36] on that and the estimate is between 1.5
[18:39] and 3.5 meat if you say to all the men
[18:42] six hundred thousand between the age of
[18:43] 20 and 60
[18:45] you kind of figure out that with all the
[18:47] children and women and and
[18:50] old older people
[18:51] then uh the total number is going to be
[18:54] a huge amount of people a multitude of
[18:57] nations
[18:59] and
[19:01] so in the spiritual
[19:03] abraham is also the father of many
[19:05] nations let's go to romans
[19:08] 4 16.
[19:28] hmm
[19:40] started uh
[19:45] let's just start at verse 13.
[19:48] for the promise that he should be the
[19:49] heir of the world is not to abraham or
[19:51] to his seed through the law but through
[19:53] the righteousness of faith
[19:55] for if they which are of the law be
[19:56] heirs faith is made void and the promise
[19:58] made of no effect
[20:00] because the law worketh wrath for where
[20:02] no law is there is no transgression
[20:05] therefore it is of faith
[20:07] that it might be by grace
[20:09] to the end the promise might be sure to
[20:11] all the seed
[20:13] not to that only which is of the law but
[20:15] to that also which is of the faith of
[20:17] abraham
[20:18] who is the father of us all
[20:20] as it is written i have made thee a
[20:22] father of many nations before him whom
[20:24] he believed leaving god and quickeneth
[20:26] the dead and calleth those things which
[20:28] be not as though they were
[20:31] who against hope believed in hope that
[20:33] he might become the father of many
[20:35] nations according to that which was
[20:36] spoken
[20:37] so shall i see be
[20:39] and being not weak in faith he
[20:41] considered not his own body now did when
[20:43] he was about 100 years old neither yet
[20:45] the deadness of sarah's womb
[20:49] um
[20:50] so
[20:51] by faith we can be part of
[20:54] many nations that come together in
[20:55] christ
[20:56] and uh
[20:59] i've got some more scripture let's see
[21:00] mark 13 10 says before
[21:03] before the end can come the gospel must
[21:06] first be published among all nations
[21:08] that's one of the requirements
[21:11] and in mark 16 15-16 said and he said
[21:14] unto them go thee into all to preach the
[21:17] gospel to every creature he that
[21:18] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[21:20] but he that believeth not shall be
[21:21] damned
[21:22] and uh in psalms 67 to the chief
[21:25] musician on negan of psalm or song god
[21:27] be merciful and us and bless bless us
[21:30] and cause his face to shine upon us
[21:32] that thou may be known upon earth by
[21:35] saving health among all nations
[21:38] so we can stand
[21:40] with the natural seed and say we have
[21:41] abraham to our father by faith
[21:45] and the seven compound names of jehovah
[21:47] 1955 around said
[21:49] now abra abraham received a promise from
[21:52] god as to be the heir to him would come
[21:53] a son and through the seed his seed
[21:55] would be heir to the world and through
[21:57] abraham's son which was isaac through
[21:59] isaac come jesus and jesus crawled in
[22:01] and she'd been the gentile and which
[22:03] forgive all nations the white man
[22:05] the brown man the yellow man the black
[22:08] man all people back redeemed back
[22:10] showing that this was the last age
[22:14] in galatians 3 8 i'll just read it
[22:17] and the scripture foreseeing that god
[22:19] would justify the heathen through faith
[22:21] preached before the gospel unto abraham
[22:23] saying and thee shall all nations be
[22:25] blessed
[22:26] so then they which be of faith
[22:28] are blessed with faithful abraham
[22:31] and revelation 7 9 and after this i be
[22:34] held in a great multitude which no man
[22:36] can number
[22:37] of just one nation just the israelites
[22:39] just the jews
[22:41] of all nations kindreds and people and
[22:44] tongues stood before the throne and
[22:45] before the lamb
[22:47] clothed with white robes and palms in
[22:48] their hands
[22:50] and the ten virgins and the hundred and
[22:51] forty four thousand in nineteen sixty uh
[22:54] said
[22:55] uh what does your wife do she serves you
[22:57] in the house so you sit down she gives
[22:58] you your food she fixes the clothing see
[23:00] she serves you day and night in the
[23:01] house see and this one these of all
[23:03] nations
[23:04] the gentiles which is the bride are
[23:06] before the throne of god with him day
[23:07] and night
[23:08] i'll remember what we said last night
[23:10] and talked to him
[23:11] and a deceived church by the world 1959
[23:14] he said one of the worst things it done
[23:17] let me start back a little bit and
[23:18] that's the way it is with the church
[23:19] when the church followed irreverently
[23:20] and daily after the leading of the holy
[23:22] spirit
[23:23] god blessed them in miracles and signs
[23:25] and wonders follow the church but when
[23:26] it began to keep bad company with the
[23:28] world one of the worst things had done
[23:30] when the first things had done it began
[23:32] to organize breaking up fellowship
[23:33] amongst other believers because they
[23:35] found out that nations were organized
[23:37] but this great gospel is not dedicated
[23:39] to one nation
[23:41] or one people it is dedicated to
[23:42] whosoever will let him come all nations
[23:45] kindreds tongues and people
[23:47] god never did intend for us to draw a
[23:49] boundary line
[23:51] and uh let's see in paragraph 39 of that
[23:54] same message now the first three
[23:55] chapters of revelation deals with the
[23:57] church
[23:58] the gentile jewish ethiopian afrikaans
[24:01] every type of people in the world goes
[24:03] to the gentiles to make up this body
[24:06] black white brown everything it's a
[24:08] bouquet of flowers and that's right that
[24:10] god puts on his offer
[24:12] and it's made up of all nations kindreds
[24:14] tongues and people
[24:18] um
[24:20] before we get into isaac
[24:25] i i hope that kind of sets the stage of
[24:27] where the birthright the the difference
[24:29] between
[24:31] the promise to joseph and to ephraim and
[24:33] the promise of judah which was to bring
[24:35] the messiah and there's a there's a
[24:37] natural and a spiritual a spiritual uh
[24:40] multitude of nations to uh
[24:43] to joseph's
[24:46] lineage to bring forth a natural
[24:48] multitude
[24:49] and we'll talk about this more next time
[24:52] but um next we're going to go into isaac
[24:54] and i see how the birthright promises
[24:56] were magnified through isaac jacob and
[24:58] then uh
[25:00] how jacob's blessing to each of his uh
[25:03] to each of the uh 12 sons places them
[25:06] positionally
[25:07] and then we'll look at judah
[25:10] the how the center goes to judah and the
[25:11] birthright blessing to joseph and
[25:13] ephraim and just keep on going down and
[25:15] look look through the genealogy of jesus
[25:17] and see who's missing in matthew and
[25:19] who's there
[25:20] and i think this will be fun so
[25:23] that's
[25:24] we'll stop right there
