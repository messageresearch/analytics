[0:02] okay morning everybody so last time
[0:06] which was April the last time I taught
[0:08] you now we all remember probably what I
[0:10] thought it was a long time ago about six
[0:11] months ago I guess I thought about come
[0:15] let us reason all right I'm going to try
[0:20] to get back into that but I never
[0:21] finished it now how do you pull up
[0:27] something from the bottom which one of
[0:33] these would be far ahead open is it in
[0:35] there
[0:51] but before we get into that subject I'm
[0:54] going to talk about perfect love because
[0:57] this is something I've been thinking
[0:58] about here lately and I don't know how
[1:01] long time to talk about this but I hope
[1:03] to get back into come let us reason
[1:04] because I never finished it and they
[1:06] were just do a quick review where we got
[1:07] up to and then finish that you see how
[1:09] going get but you know brother branham
[1:14] talked about that we need perfect love
[1:16] to go to the future home and to go to
[1:19] heaven or where you know beyond here we
[1:21] have to look it's a requirement it's a
[1:24] prerequisite you know you have to have
[1:25] it but it's not something so far off
[1:28] that we can't attain to it if so then
[1:30] God would not have anybody there so it's
[1:33] not something so far off that we can't
[1:35] attain to it we know that so what I'm
[1:38] going to do is I'm going to review a
[1:40] little bit of my testimony about either
[1:41] everybody kept our members that are baby
[1:44] i was born with premature lungs and she
[1:47] nearly died well I want to try to delve
[1:52] into just the middle part of that
[1:54] testimony because I know I skimmed over
[1:56] so fast that a lot of people missed it
[1:58] what really happened alright so they won
[2:01] wednesday's she was born in four minutes
[2:03] to amend not on the fourth day of the
[2:04] week y'all never be talking about all
[2:05] fours how God's number of deliverance is
[2:08] for there's lots of fours in there well
[2:11] she was born and started to diminish
[2:14] really quickly and they took her to the
[2:17] NICU and she got worse and worse over
[2:19] the next few days by the third day by
[2:21] Saturday she was nearly dead hi nobody
[2:23] had told us by that time that she was
[2:25] dying it was parental intuition I guess
[2:28] you could say or instinct we know
[2:30] because it's her baby this time we know
[2:31] she's done nabasa tell us and Gavin I
[2:34] didn't talk about it we didn't use the D
[2:35] work we didn't even discuss that she was
[2:37] done but as we stats that they were
[2:39] watching her that Saturday the thing
[2:42] that came to my mind is that scripture
[2:44] about having done all to stand you stand
[2:46] which to me means you read your Bible
[2:48] you pray you go to church keeping
[2:50] everything you do you stand for Christ
[2:52] no matter what
[2:54] and it's easy sometimes but sometimes
[2:56] it's really hard when you're facing
[2:57] adversity so I told guy who would need
[2:59] to stand literally and go to church even
[3:02] though we're watching our baby died and
[3:04] I didn't say that work with her I didn't
[3:05] use the word and confess it I didn't
[3:07] like you think about her night but I
[3:09] knew we had to leave and go to church so
[3:11] we went and that was a Bible study night
[3:13] and we cried all the way to church we
[3:17] caught all during church and then at the
[3:19] end of it by the way spoke those words
[3:21] to me or God through by the way he spoke
[3:24] the words to me that I believe turned
[3:25] the whole thing around so I received
[3:27] what I had need up just for her healing
[3:29] right there but what if I had been there
[3:31] you know but my point is what we were
[3:34] doing was making an act of love to God
[3:36] because we were against this adversity
[3:39] so we were acting on love we said god we
[3:42] love you and we'll come to church anyway
[3:43] even if our baby thighs in her bed while
[3:46] we're at church we're gonna come we were
[3:48] just making a determination in ourselves
[3:49] to do that well that night we went home
[3:52] went to bed daddy didn't go to sleep
[3:54] come on i can't sleep on our babies in
[3:56] the hospital sick dying but I fell
[3:59] asleep for about an hour and Gavin woke
[4:02] me up and said your phones ringing so I
[4:03] got to mention my phone you know how
[4:04] hard it is to wake up at you're going to
[4:06] sleep for one hour I got a bad answer my
[4:09] phone it was the doctor they said your
[4:11] baby is not doing any good she's not
[4:13] responding to our treatment we can't do
[4:15] anything only four we're going to send
[4:16] her to a Kirsten so we need your consent
[4:19] you need to come in and sign his paper
[4:21] so we came in there signed the paper we
[4:24] got it home to come babysit our other
[4:25] three girls like the hospital in
[4:28] Haynesville signed the paper watch them
[4:30] put her delicately in this little box
[4:31] this little plastic kind of incubator to
[4:35] transfer her down to Atlanta and we went
[4:37] down ahead of her on the way down I
[4:40] didn't know this until recently the
[4:42] paramedic told Gaby didn't tell me for
[4:46] some reason and Gabby never thought to
[4:47] tell me until recently she had actually
[4:49] almost lost I would twice on the way now
[4:51] she because she was on an oscillating
[4:53] respirator which is machine that that
[4:55] makes her chest you like this she
[4:57] doesn't inhale and exhale I
[4:59] her lungs would stay inflated constantly
[5:01] and just barely move like that like that
[5:04] air compressor which doesn't look human
[5:07] it looks like a science project gone bad
[5:09] it looks disgusting I was terrible to
[5:11] see your baby in that condition but they
[5:12] didn't have that in ambulance so she was
[5:14] having the pump a hand for an hour ride
[5:16] as fast as she could trying to keep out
[5:18] his lungs inflated and there they lost
[5:19] her twice and then only when we got down
[5:22] there we met dr. Karpen which is a very
[5:25] renowned baby doctor all throughout the
[5:27] southeast she set us down in this in
[5:31] consultation room and looked me in the
[5:33] eye and said your baby is time and
[5:36] that's the first time we've been told
[5:37] that this was very much like Satan as a
[5:39] roaring lion roaring right in my face
[5:41] with all this fear that gripped me like
[5:44] I've never seen before and I stood there
[5:46] like you doing somebody's yelling at you
[5:48] and you're facing stand there just kind
[5:49] of take it with them the you know hug
[5:50] and Gabby was breaking down crying I'm
[5:53] just trying to be strong for her and
[5:55] that she did this she was simply the one
[5:58] is not a devil that one was a good
[5:59] doctor you know and doing the best she
[6:01] perhaps the best to save her baby and I
[6:03] respect her but what she was telling us
[6:06] was terrible news and it was Satan
[6:07] roaring in our face telling us a lot I
[6:09] want to take your baby tonight three
[6:11] hours later pulling me back up so that
[6:14] she told us about this procedure we're
[6:15] going to have to do in your baby which
[6:17] is called ECMO where we put this tube
[6:19] down her jugular vein to draw the blood
[6:22] out circulated through a machine put
[6:24] oxygen in it and put it back in her body
[6:26] that would save her body long enough for
[6:28] her lungs to Hill because she's not
[6:29] getting honest I her lungs were not
[6:31] absorbing the oxygen they were inflating
[6:33] they were when he call it respirating
[6:36] but they weren't taking in oxygen so
[6:38] she's fixed hind brain damage vital
[6:41] organs were fixing to shut down before
[6:42] her lungs even got a chance to heal so
[6:45] they said we're going to do this
[6:47] procedure if she needs it her oxygen
[6:48] saturation was thirty-nine percent
[6:51] before she left Gainesville Tom got down
[6:53] to Atlanta and on the way down and
[6:55] telling how long it was they never told
[6:56] us the thirty-nine percent which is
[6:58] a dolt with died on that I'm pretty sure
[7:03] a baby can small baby can live for a
[7:06] while like that but thirty-nine percent
[7:08] is very borderline brain damage all
[7:11] right because no Washington and other
[7:12] organs would start shutting down so we
[7:14] go there sit beside her for a few hours
[7:16] on no sleep time to read my Bible was
[7:19] praying together in town system then
[7:20] watch them work on our baby and she's
[7:21] lifeless as can be and all the while
[7:23] were dozing off and just trying to
[7:25] fighting sleep were emotionally drained
[7:27] and spiritually drained physically
[7:28] drained and I say to god about six
[7:30] o'clock in the morning it's time to get
[7:32] up go back to gainesville and let's go
[7:34] to church and that's that was the
[7:37] hardest time of my life i'm sure it's
[7:39] even harder than saturday night because
[7:40] this time were actually told she's dying
[7:42] and the procedure itself in that ECMO
[7:45] she's likely to die just in the
[7:46] procedure because they're cutting her
[7:47] jugular vein open and putting it to them
[7:49] they have to put her in surgery and in
[7:51] the surgery during that procedure that
[7:53] could kill her home so in the midst of
[7:56] all that i said well we're going to go
[7:57] church what's just an act of love to god
[8:01] we love God and complete here and we're
[8:04] saying you know Satan this group come
[8:07] against us with all this adversity how
[8:09] much more should we stand and serve God
[8:12] in the midst of that so he stood we went
[8:14] up against mill cutter other kids ready
[8:16] went to church that morning brother
[8:18] william ward of on crease and i
[8:19] testified that august well she's fine
[8:22] everything's gonna be fine that was just
[8:24] a positive confession but because hard
[8:27] time there at that time she was probably
[8:28] already dead I didn't know but left the
[8:31] hospital and on the way back down to
[8:33] Atlanta it was just one service that day
[8:34] we called him and said I wanted to say a
[8:37] she life but instead of just says your
[8:39] neck know yet and they said no she's
[8:41] actually getting better that's what she
[8:43] began to recover and all the rest of
[8:45] time for the next 30 days that she was
[8:47] in the hospital she was became they're
[8:48] getting better but what we did in the
[8:50] missus that was two acts of love that we
[8:52] committed toward God you know and I
[8:54] don't want to say I mean I want to
[8:55] confess that was perfect love but I'm
[8:57] not going to you know folks and say we
[8:59] have all
[9:00] you know understand we are committing an
[9:02] act of love to go all right and that's
[9:06] kind of probably long and hot saying all
[9:08] this for bragging just showing an
[9:09] exemplar all our money guy was Mary's
[9:11] our marriage what we did before we got
[9:13] married we sat down and we decided we
[9:15] want a marriage based on you know a
[9:18] triangle or three fold cord where God is
[9:20] involved in the mayor's it's not just me
[9:21] and Gabi one God involved in putting
[9:24] garlic to be the centerpiece of our
[9:25] marriage meaning that we seek God
[9:27] together we read our Bible pretty good
[9:28] well in the midst of that say we
[9:30] actually got married this was kind of
[9:32] weird to most people but we got married
[9:34] saturday Saturday night you know what
[9:38] happened Sunday morning we were in
[9:39] church okay which is awkward because
[9:41] everybody knew you know wedding night
[9:43] hello and then where we were sitting
[9:45] interest I was high you shouldn't be
[9:49] here you know it was kind of awkward but
[9:51] the pastor turned us out with a loser he
[9:53] said he said boy and expect to see my
[9:56] god but god bless shows good you'll be
[9:58] here embassies everywhere again well I
[10:00] worse but we hope I mean we we you know
[10:02] we got married yesterday we still got
[10:05] down the road from the Turkish to go to
[10:06] church but for some reason this is
[10:08] typical for people to get married and
[10:09] run off into the sunset for week and
[10:11] whatever but we want to be in charge to
[10:13] the want to serve God alright and then
[10:15] every time we've had a baby the very
[10:17] following service most of the time we're
[10:19] in church with a three day old baby
[10:21] which is where the most people you set
[10:22] out for a few which is understandable
[10:24] because you don't the better to say but
[10:26] we just said God we want to come to my
[10:27] what and then and then I looked at my
[10:30] night shift work situation kick me out
[10:33] and work on Wednesday nights I thought
[10:34] if I can be here when my baby's dying I
[10:36] should not let work keep me out of
[10:38] church anymore I never wanted that in
[10:40] the first place just my boss offered it
[10:42] to me and I didn't foresee that I miss
[10:44] half the ones the nights of the year
[10:46] twenty six or so when's the nights of
[10:48] the year so I phone had enough of that I
[10:51] said go on a walk on night shift so i
[10:52] can big church on wednesday nights and
[10:54] he worked it out and by God's grace
[10:56] we've been here everyone tonight sent
[10:57] again another act of love now here's
[10:59] what I'm getting to so what when you
[11:01] show God your love but there's lots of
[11:03] reasons to be at church besides hearing
[11:06] the word and the fellowship and and just
[11:08] being in that atmosphere there's lots of
[11:10] reasons a bigger but he's
[11:11] not forsaking the assembling ourselves
[11:13] together and so much more did you see
[11:14] the Day approaching he didn't say why we
[11:17] think it's because to hear the word but
[11:19] there are lots of other reasons for that
[11:20] but primarily it's obedience you're just
[11:22] acting out of love and acting in
[11:24] obedience to God now Monica sister
[11:28] Monica right around the time that Iowa
[11:32] was in the hospital right after that of
[11:34] trial I think it was when Monica's mom
[11:37] died and I asked her we're praying for
[11:39] everybody was praying for it and I said
[11:41] since ramón files from I'm doing with a
[11:43] branch what she said she smiled she said
[11:45] she couldn't find gonna be okay gonna
[11:48] give her you know every time I asked her
[11:50] shed a father confession I was shocked
[11:52] to hear the monkeys mom died despite
[11:53] that and you know what right after her
[11:57] mom died she came to church on it became
[12:00] the church not only that but she kept
[12:02] teaching those little kitties about
[12:03] Jesus and you know what was in her mind
[12:05] that Satan tempted her and said I didn't
[12:07] talk to you about this but I know I know
[12:09] what Satan is I nothing would have
[12:10] tempted her and said you're gonna tell
[12:11] those little kitties about Jesus and he
[12:13] took your mom you know that's just the
[12:15] way that works and she said yeah I'm
[12:18] sure she said yeah I'm going to anyway
[12:19] so she she commits an act of love toward
[12:22] God by continuing to come to church to
[12:24] spot the leaving up to the very end of
[12:26] her mom died she said God won't keep
[12:27] coming anyway I'm gonna keep serving
[12:29] anyone keep teaching these kids about
[12:31] you anyway so to Rebecca Atkins I hope
[12:33] she bigger this morning psychic
[12:35] microphase graduate Delta her tablish
[12:38] good man okay tell me what can you tell
[12:40] ya um you know her husband got her
[12:44] husband of 18 years passed away I'm
[12:46] going to be a floor in it back and she
[12:50] came the very next service that means
[12:52] they're not you know he had passed away
[12:53] friday we had the funeral sunday wins
[12:57] and I shoes in church I said back there
[12:58] that Wednesday and looking to buy bread
[12:59] and just to accomplish that sister no
[13:02] I'm sitting there just nearly in tears I
[13:03] meant she'd be there I mean I had a
[13:04] feeling that I know what she is and I
[13:06] knew she'd be faithful and be here even
[13:08] if her husband died no one talked to her
[13:09] that night I said I really admire your
[13:11] faith and such harmonica to you about
[13:13] hers with her mom because they committed
[13:15] these acts of love toward God even
[13:18] though their loved ones had done now
[13:20] ours didn't dive our baby was dying
[13:22] but when we came to church anyway but
[13:24] their loved ones actually I her husband
[13:26] died and she came to church all right an
[13:28] act of love to thought faithfulness now
[13:33] um and then who else was there was
[13:36] another example I think I had to do but
[13:38] what I want you to see in all this is I
[13:41] did not get jealous over sister Rebecca
[13:44] committing that act of blood that
[13:45] eyewitness poor dog that act of faith oh
[13:47] there's another one more example quick
[13:49] so then brother branham had prayed I
[13:51] think for a baby and he told him this
[13:53] this and one of his sermons he talked
[13:55] about a couple whose baby had actually
[13:57] died like ours was dying but this was
[13:58] coming this wouldn't baby died and they
[14:01] were in church the next service the
[14:02] thing in point of the mountain said you
[14:04] know something about that's faith he
[14:06] pointed them said that's faith I said
[14:08] well how is that faith because it's an
[14:09] act of love and love produces faith
[14:11] right so they came to church after the
[14:14] baby died you know they didn't stay at
[14:16] home in morn for three days they came
[14:18] right back to church baby just died and
[14:20] brother branham I think and pray for the
[14:21] baby the gods will is sovereign so he
[14:23] took the baby anyway he had a reasoning
[14:25] that but the people came to church
[14:27] anyway and he said that's faith and I
[14:29] thought of Monica and Rebecca and our
[14:32] situations where with all these times we
[14:34] should have been in church but became
[14:35] anyway showing God our love we're just
[14:38] simply making looks the Lord by saying I
[14:40] love him I'm gonna be here alright so
[14:42] here if I thought there was no jealousy
[14:44] in any of that because Rebecca committed
[14:45] that same act that we had done and I
[14:47] admired it and I wasn't enthused about
[14:49] it because someone else is showing love
[14:51] to my god and I want him to receive all
[14:53] the love he came from anywhere say she
[14:56] was doing that in mind was Joseph Joseph
[14:59] Monica they had gone even beyond us
[15:00] because like I said their loved ones had
[15:02] died and they came anyway ours didn't
[15:04] even God and so that I didn't get
[15:07] jealous of them and actually I was
[15:10] induced about it and loved to see that
[15:12] and I want to encourage them and tell
[15:14] anybody so my point is in perfect love
[15:17] there is no jealousy and perfect love
[15:20] there's no malice there's no strife
[15:23] there's no any imperfections perfect
[15:25] look is absolutely pure form hijos
[15:28] names and then I thought about sister
[15:31] brown you know a brother been his first
[15:34] wife died sister hope and brother
[15:36] Brennan would be on the curtain of time
[15:37] now he had remarried and he had married
[15:39] sister me who would build front of time
[15:41] saw his first wife and hoped her came
[15:44] back told me about you thanked me to be
[15:46] jealous and she probably was because
[15:48] she's skilled in this realm of Philip we
[15:50] don't understand we don't put never
[15:51] experienced this great extent of agave
[15:54] love as it is feeling kind of time we
[15:57] had experienced it in its fullest yet
[15:58] but she should have been jealous you
[16:01] would think oh brother BAM and I'm sure
[16:03] she crossed the bank said well you know
[16:05] what else did y'all do talk yes or
[16:07] something you know that's there's no
[16:08] perversion nobody's married there
[16:10] nobody's given in marriage and we can't
[16:12] comprehend it with it I didn't take the
[16:14] whole class to do this but we didn't
[16:16] understand we can't understand this it
[16:18] doesn't really what can't wrap our minds
[16:20] around it it's beyond us so but she
[16:22] wasn't jealous and um Oh hoping there
[16:26] and let's let's go and read a quote
[16:27] about that okay so this is from mostly
[16:31] supposedly from the rejected King I look
[16:33] this way in that way and they were
[16:35] coming by the thousands and I said I
[16:36] don't understand this this is why they
[16:38] and Here Come hope that was my first
[16:41] wife she run and never said my husband
[16:44] she said my precious brother and when
[16:46] she helped me there was another woman
[16:48] standing there they told me say how you
[16:52] would think now hope is gonna stand back
[16:53] she's gonna build uh huh you know hopes
[16:56] me first was and this element moment is
[16:58] hugging brother branham but and I
[17:00] thought oh this has to be something
[17:01] different oh no she's not stupid
[17:04] there was another moment stand there
[17:06] homie and then hope hug this woman so
[17:09] she didn't turn it in slapper she should
[17:10] have slapped her if we were in this room
[17:12] that's what would what should have
[17:13] happened but in that round an imperfect
[17:15] look instead she went over to have
[17:17] another sister you can just hugged her
[17:18] husband you know and I thought oh this
[17:20] has to be something different it can't
[17:22] be there's something I thought oh but I
[17:24] ever want to go back that'll parsing
[17:27] around there and I thought what is this
[17:28] I looked real good i said i can't
[17:30] understand it but hope seemed to be like
[17:32] an old guest of honor she has no
[17:34] different or she was not different but
[17:36] just a guest of honor but i know there i
[17:39] believe will have a relationship like
[17:40] will know that we were husband and wife
[17:42] here man gabby but there won't be any
[17:44] this hugging and kissing type stuff that
[17:46] we do here now on the attributes of
[17:47] failure low be there vivid a love is a
[17:49] condescended part of God God when he
[17:53] condescended I believe his attributes
[17:55] condescended with him love was one of
[17:57] those agave descended to philly oh where
[17:59] we could receive it and understand it in
[18:01] a minor form but it's only opposite end
[18:03] of the spectrum from agape love it's so
[18:06] alpha love is so far beyond video love
[18:09] at best you could say a little love is
[18:11] just like a maybe a shadow or type of it
[18:13] and something just to give us a little
[18:14] bit of understanding about it is only
[18:17] going to make you understand by with me
[18:20] and then I heard a voice in and spoke
[18:22] man was in the room said this was this
[18:24] is what you preached was the Holy Ghost
[18:26] this is perfect love and nothing can
[18:29] enter here without it I'm more
[18:31] determined than ever my life that it's
[18:33] like the perfect love to enter here
[18:34] there was no jealousy there was no
[18:35] tiredness there was no death sickness
[18:38] could never in their mortality can never
[18:42] make you old and they could not pry it
[18:46] was just one joy oh my precious brother
[18:49] okay so i guess i'm going to take the
[18:55] rest of the plastic explain this one a
[18:56] little part took about 20 minutes to
[18:59] tell gabby the other day so i'm going to
[19:00] try to put it into five minutes so then
[19:04] the prereq for prerequisites for living
[19:08] in this realm this dimension or what a
[19:10] terrestrial body and a spirit and a soul
[19:14] you pretty well have to have all three
[19:16] of those right if not you're dead you
[19:18] don't have those three body spirit and
[19:20] soul to live in this realm or what are
[19:22] the and I just started thing on this
[19:23] have another study about it a whole lot
[19:24] yet but what are the prerequisites for
[19:26] that now perfect love maybe I guess
[19:29] you'd say celestial body with the elf
[19:31] anybody you
[19:32] have to have somebody to move around but
[19:33] you had to have perfect love to enter
[19:35] their face right why because God is
[19:39] operating on faith this holding power
[19:40] around his whole entire premise is based
[19:42] on faith and you can't enter that room
[19:45] without it think about God before the
[19:49] foundation world when he was ill him and
[19:51] he condescended to logos which speech
[19:54] was born language was born so we could
[19:55] have some part to understand God without
[19:58] that that they just is great big
[19:59] invisible God that nobody could even
[20:00] comprehend and out of that Canyon low
[20:02] cost and he said let there be my brother
[20:04] Brennan said and I don't know if he ever
[20:06] talk about the big thing but I believe
[20:08] in the Big Bang to the extent of what
[20:10] brother Brennan said where he said it
[20:11] seemed like there was nothing it wasn't
[20:13] in his face it wasn't even time it
[20:14] wasn't a matter energy or anything goes
[20:16] nothing and then brother Brennan said an
[20:18] atom burst when God said let there be an
[20:20] atom burst and all of matter time energy
[20:23] space everything came into existence
[20:25] that one creative act in a begin to
[20:27] expand into this universe that we know
[20:29] today what was that not spoken he
[20:32] believed that he mixes onward with faith
[20:34] and the two mixed together is a powerful
[20:36] recipe that makes the universe see the
[20:39] faith of man is in a measure God gives
[20:41] every man a measure of faith but God
[20:43] God's path is measureless so he can
[20:46] create a universe man's faith can move a
[20:48] mountain we were treated and said you
[20:49] can say to the Streamy they looked up
[20:51] Custis II didn't be done moved to the
[20:53] mountain in that faith is grainy mustard
[20:55] seed you must receive as small and what
[20:58] makes you think thing so with that
[21:00] little measure of faith that we have
[21:01] with the move mountains but the faith of
[21:03] God can create a universe that declares
[21:05] himself so that faith his whole entire
[21:08] attributions hold everything is based on
[21:10] faith and when we go to heaven we have
[21:12] to faith to enter we have to have faith
[21:14] to remain there so think about this this
[21:17] is sort of a philosophical question but
[21:20] if you were in heaven if something I
[21:21] could get in heaven with no faith and
[21:22] you were there in heaven with no faith
[21:25] would you even know you were there you
[21:28] know what I mean because everything your
[21:30] contact is by faith everything you would
[21:33] see there will be my faith everything
[21:34] you touch will be but my faith
[21:36] everything
[21:36] that you experience with it by faith so
[21:38] you wouldn't even know you were there
[21:39] couldn't have faith in Jesus in Matthew
[21:41] 22 was talking about the wedding Garth
[21:43] the man that got in without the way
[21:44] Garth why they didn't cast him out in
[21:45] outer darkness because he had no Carmen
[21:47] the Holy Ghost no faith so then you
[21:50] can't operate in that room you came to
[21:51] go into that room without faith so God
[21:53] during this whole entire time we're here
[21:55] on earth is trying to get us to play
[21:57] that's the most basic element of
[21:59] Christianity is always believed Christ
[22:00] APC right only believe simply believe
[22:03] all things are possible with them to
[22:04] believe you just said over and over
[22:05] again fear not only believe right he
[22:08] said believe believe believe so if we
[22:10] just simply believe the whole entire
[22:12] thing see God doesn't appear to us in a
[22:15] fleshly form could be easier to believe
[22:17] them but he said blessed are they that
[22:18] believe and have not seen so if you
[22:21] hadn't have seen the form of God
[22:22] appeared to you which most of us have it
[22:24] the boss is no medicine got any time in
[22:26] this carnal mind I guess there's no way
[22:28] for us to see God you know but we have
[22:30] to see him by eyes of faith he wants us
[22:33] to believe so that we can even go there
[22:35] the whole I mean the whole entire thing
[22:37] about Christianity is just based upon
[22:39] believing I'm brother Bill concretion a
[22:41] lot about believing God highs and
[22:44] simplicity he doesn't manifest himself
[22:45] openings not a show off you know in the
[22:47] whole entire creation of the universe
[22:49] they've studied and seen in telescopes I
[22:52] don't know if y'all know this but the
[22:54] whole space telescope can actually see
[22:55] down through time because space is so
[22:58] the expansive space is so broad that
[23:00] they can actually sit back with the host
[23:02] table space coast up to the Big Bang
[23:04] almost to the Big Bang becuase there
[23:06] same space is expanding and it expanded
[23:08] faster than light light travels at you
[23:12] know six million miles six trillion
[23:13] miles a year 186,000 miles per second
[23:16] but the matter in space and time
[23:19] expended faster than that so it's beyond
[23:21] it so then now here we are in planet
[23:23] earth and we can look back from the
[23:25] Hubble Space Telescope they can look so
[23:27] far down through space actually can
[23:29] actually see the early existence of the
[23:32] universe as galaxies were beginning to
[23:34] form you know they can actually see that
[23:36] early time in the universe and all that
[23:39] time that the faith was a she not even
[23:41] lost
[23:42] talk now oh yeah because they can see in
[23:44] other words they can see that the you
[23:45] know evolving of the universe into these
[23:48] different little galaxies and solar
[23:50] systems is God was forming things
[23:51] together but they didn't see the hand of
[23:52] God putting this they're putting out
[23:54] there they didn't see God forming the
[23:55] Sun they didn't see any of God because
[23:57] he's do it in his simplicity when you
[24:00] see things in nature you see you can
[24:01] watch them through a microscope a
[24:03] conception of a baby you can see these
[24:06] little germs floating around this egg
[24:08] and all of a sudden one of them
[24:09] seemingly on its own accord just goes
[24:11] into the egg well what is that God is
[24:13] behind that moving that there but you
[24:14] cannot see him God is going to show off
[24:16] and he can't be seen and all the natural
[24:18] things we just can't look around their
[24:20] natural eyes I'm seeing you have to
[24:21] believe in my faith so then God highs in
[24:24] simplicity he reveals itself in
[24:25] simplicity it's impossible to see go
[24:27] about faith and hospital please God
[24:29] without faith bob says so that's pretty
[24:33] much for all this and I thought up the
[24:34] whole time to do that if you get to the
[24:35] bit to the come let us reason
[24:56] No
