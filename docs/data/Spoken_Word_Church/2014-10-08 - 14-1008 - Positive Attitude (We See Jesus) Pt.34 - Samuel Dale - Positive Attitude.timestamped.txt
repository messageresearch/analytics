[6:20] before so always when you come here one
[6:22] time your visitor two times you just
[6:24] part of us so we say welcome back you
[6:27] know good to see you in a brother
[6:30] Brother Willie Ross's daughter that goes
[6:33] away back
[6:35] we used to come up here he would and
[6:36] they'd bring about 40 of them and we
[6:38] turned around this way and a little seat
[6:41] area here and Pulpit over here
[6:44] and they'd sing Jordan River
[6:47] I still love that song that's a that's a
[6:50] good doing but good to see him
[6:53] uh they get to announcements out of the
[6:56] way especially prior to night for
[6:58] brother George Quinn from Ireland he's
[7:01] gone to Turkey and he said that's kind
[7:04] of in a
[7:06] that area between two countries there
[7:08] and he said for us to please pray that
[7:11] the Lord would would take care of him
[7:13] while he's there so remember that
[7:15] request especially tonight
[7:18] oh another Aaron's little boy he's been
[7:22] sick vomiting and all the different
[7:24] doings and just keep him in mind that
[7:26] Lord would touch him and bring him on
[7:28] out of this situation called his they'll
[7:31] dehydrate and he they had to take him to
[7:33] the doctor and you know got close to
[7:35] having to put him in the hospital so
[7:37] just keep him in your prayers and a lot
[7:39] of others that were sick and everything
[7:40] remember them
[7:42] um brother Douglas has been sick so
[7:44] remember him I also remember now
[7:47] tomorrow on Josiah is going to be flying
[7:51] out to Colorado by himself
[7:54] so we want to pray a special prayer that
[7:58] everything will be all right he's going
[7:59] to go out there and go elk hunting so I
[8:03] think if he's able to fly by himself
[8:04] he's able to go to elk hunting too you
[8:06] know everything would be all right so
[8:08] remember that any other announcements
[8:10] I'm trying to remember everything we
[8:13] didn't take communion this last Sunday
[8:14] because
[8:15] we've got five preachers in all five was
[8:18] gone we've got three deacons all three
[8:19] was gone so we're going to try to have
[8:21] somebody here this weekend and and have
[8:24] the the communion and foot washing all
[8:26] right so you know doing that amen uh
[8:29] anything else I believe that's all that
[8:31] Terence has announced the
[8:33] um time there of the festival
[8:36] and just come and be with us and have a
[8:38] good time in the Lord for that Saturday
[8:41] and you know we always try to get
[8:43] together and we do this you know
[8:47] everybody comes I mean we all enjoy
[8:49] sitting around talking but we do a lot
[8:51] for the kids at that time so parents now
[8:53] please listen uh it's for the kids
[8:58] so don't wait till four o'clock and
[8:59] drive in with your kids
[9:01] when we done started it too
[9:04] you know you're disrespectful for your
[9:06] children because that's what we're
[9:07] trying to do is they give them some time
[9:09] to have fun but yet you got your you got
[9:12] to put yourself up and be in front of
[9:14] the mirrors or do something or go to
[9:16] Walmart or do something and hang out
[9:18] somewhere else you could get your kids
[9:21] here
[9:22] to where they could have a good time
[9:23] together all right don't just do that
[9:26] okay uh I think that's all we've got you
[9:30] know the ones that are coming the
[9:31] ministers will be ministering for us
[9:33] brother Jewel Forney will be preaching
[9:36] that weekend so remember him brother
[9:38] prakash will be preaching on Wednesday
[9:40] after that 29th brother uh
[9:45] Ernie villanuevo will be here the first
[9:47] Sunday in November and then brother
[9:50] William borlavon will be here with us
[9:53] for the watch not service so I think
[9:55] that's all of the the different ones but
[9:58] if you like turning your scriptures
[9:59] tonight turn to First Corinthians 15.
[10:04] and Hebrews 2.
[10:06] First Corinthians in Hebrews 2 would
[10:10] just might be much in prayer for a
[10:12] little Josiah there as he you know goes
[10:14] out and Lord take care of him all right
[10:17] Lord Jesus we thank you for your grace
[10:19] and your guidance into each one of our
[10:22] hearts and our lives we thank you for an
[10:24] opportunity to be able to gather tonight
[10:26] to Lord fellowship with our brothers and
[10:29] sisters
[10:30] of like faith that we can talk about you
[10:33] and
[10:34] know for a surety that you said if any
[10:36] two together in my name you'll be in the
[10:38] midst so Lord surely there's at least
[10:41] two here tonight that could agree
[10:42] somewhere and we would know you'd be
[10:44] here
[10:45] but Lord we pray that you guide us as we
[10:47] try to minister your word and open our
[10:50] eyes that we may see and let our hearts
[10:53] be set on you forgive our sins cleanse
[10:56] us from all unrighteousness and keep us
[10:58] Lord in Jesus name
[11:01] amen
[11:02] all right
[11:04] we'll go to First Corinthians 15.
[11:07] 24 now maybe we'll go back in another
[11:10] message and pick up some of the other
[11:12] scriptures but I've just got a thought
[11:15] out of this tonight that I want to get
[11:17] to you so
[11:19] let's read verse 24 through 26.
[11:24] then come at the end when he shall have
[11:27] delivered up the kingdom of God even the
[11:29] father when he shall not put down all
[11:32] Rule and all authority and Power
[11:35] for he must Reign till he hath put all
[11:37] enemies under his feet
[11:40] The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed
[11:43] is death all right now
[11:47] so then now let's go over to Hebrews 2
[11:52] and we'll begin we'll read verse
[11:55] 5-9
[11:58] but unto the Angels hath he not put in
[12:01] subjection the world to come wherever we
[12:05] speak
[12:06] but one in a certain place testifies
[12:08] saying what is man the dark mindful of
[12:11] him or the son of man that thou visits
[12:13] is him that made us him a little lower
[12:15] than the Angels thy Crown as him with
[12:18] glory and honor and just
[12:20] just sit over set him over the works of
[12:23] thy hands
[12:24] thou Hast put all things in subjection
[12:26] under his feet for in that he hath put
[12:29] all in subjection under him he left
[12:33] nothing that is not put under him now
[12:35] watch that he left nothing that's not
[12:37] put under him
[12:38] all right
[12:40] but now we see not yet all things put
[12:44] under him
[12:46] now that's a that's a hard statement for
[12:49] a preacher to say
[12:51] all is under him
[12:53] would look like ain't all under him you
[12:55] know
[12:56] so then we have to realize and find out
[12:57] what's going on all right but now we see
[13:00] not yet all things put under him what
[13:03] but we see Jesus it was made a little
[13:06] lower than the angels for the suffering
[13:07] of death crowned with Glory and Honor
[13:10] that he by the grace of God should taste
[13:13] death for every man you may be seated
[13:16] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[13:19] of the word just keep brother Quinn in
[13:21] your prayers
[13:23] this week you know in the time he said
[13:25] he'd be over there to the 14th I believe
[13:28] but just remember that
[13:31] now
[13:32] I said we we read here
[13:36] that
[13:37] in Corinthians that the
[13:40] The Last Enemy
[13:43] uh
[13:45] some were called and said shale
[13:48] it was not done away back then
[13:51] as we would think
[13:53] but yet all things were destroyed by him
[13:57] or conquered by him
[13:59] now so that's where we need to to think
[14:02] about this is the Bible that contrary to
[14:06] say that the Last Enemy is not destroyed
[14:08] and then turned around and say and you'd
[14:10] say well then Jesus Christ only
[14:12] destroyed certain things
[14:14] all right
[14:15] see because you'd say we don't see all
[14:17] things put under him but that's what I'm
[14:20] trying my best to get you and I to think
[14:23] about
[14:24] what are we been talking about a
[14:27] positive attitude
[14:29] that as I the statement I make
[14:33] almost every service that anyone in the
[14:36] Bible or anyone in our day or whatever
[14:38] are down through the dispensation of the
[14:41] Gospel that ever amounted to anything in
[14:44] God was people that had a positive
[14:45] attitude
[14:47] all right now that's not mind over
[14:49] matter
[14:50] you know
[14:51] it's not just that form of positive
[14:54] attitude it's a positive attitude when
[14:58] God speaks to you
[15:02] and tells you what's going to take place
[15:06] and then you stand there and you see it
[15:09] taking place
[15:10] all right and see in doing that then we
[15:14] can still we can follow it to a point
[15:17] that uh
[15:20] I believe that there's a group of people
[15:22] in the end time
[15:24] I believe every age I'll get to it a
[15:27] little bit Sunday to speak about it some
[15:29] maybe the Lord willing on the overcomer
[15:32] but
[15:33] I believe every age has had the reported
[15:36] part of the word
[15:38] you know in the time
[15:41] whether it would be Old Testament New
[15:43] Testament or whatever
[15:44] the people has had a portion of the word
[15:47] for each age in time
[15:50] and they've lived that that's why I'm
[15:52] talking about a positive attitude they
[15:55] they had something that was more than
[15:58] just a letter of the word as I
[16:01] illustrate about Luke Martin Luther no
[16:03] telling how many times he read that the
[16:05] just shall live by faith he may have
[16:08] made great speeches about it maybe you
[16:11] know sermons about it and all but see
[16:14] one day something happened when the man
[16:17] something happened he got a positive
[16:19] attitude
[16:20] then he turned the world upside down
[16:22] right the disciples in the upper room
[16:25] they had the word
[16:29] but they didn't have a positive attitude
[16:31] that's why Peter could say over there
[16:33] later you know
[16:35] he said I was on the mountain with the
[16:37] Lord Jesus
[16:39] but he said I have a more sure word or
[16:42] we have a more sure word of Prophecy all
[16:46] right something made alive and that's
[16:48] what I've tried since I come into the
[16:51] message
[16:52] and and everything talking today about
[16:54] it that
[16:56] I've tried to have a positive attitude
[16:59] to look at things as our day
[17:02] I love to read about other people
[17:06] you know I mean I've read of Smith
[17:08] Wigglesworth and what 16 times or
[17:11] something like that that the dead was
[17:13] raised in the man's Ministry I forgot
[17:15] exactly the amount but you know I love
[17:17] to read about that
[17:18] I love to read about the things that the
[17:21] great ones like brother random would
[17:23] speak of Saint Martin and he said that
[17:26] there was nobody as great as Saint
[17:28] Martin he said except the Lord Jesus
[17:30] Christ you know all right and she said
[17:34] you know see they had a positive
[17:36] attitude but they were positive because
[17:39] it had been revealed to them the day
[17:43] they were living
[17:44] all right
[17:46] now
[17:47] when it's revealed to you and I not
[17:49] letters on a page
[17:52] I was asked about like when I preached
[17:55] in 1969 about the son of man
[17:58] and uh I believed it then and I was
[18:01] asked the question well uh you know when
[18:04] did it become alive to you
[18:07] well really I'm honest to say it I'm
[18:09] truthful when I first heard this message
[18:13] I saw things come alive to me that I'd
[18:17] always wondered about
[18:19] you know that don't make me no different
[18:21] you should have to you should be able to
[18:23] say that that this message brought to
[18:25] light things that you had wondered about
[18:28] all of your life and and studied on and
[18:30] and thought about and prayed about
[18:33] all right and see by that then I've
[18:36] always had been a positive attitude
[18:37] about the point
[18:39] but I want you to see
[18:42] the day and the hour that we're living
[18:45] all right that's why we spent so much
[18:47] time on this series to to bring
[18:51] everything to a basis
[18:53] that
[18:55] no matter how far you go backward
[18:59] they're dependent upon you and I
[19:01] no matter how far you go forward
[19:04] and any others are the Fifield Jews the
[19:07] 144 000 foolish virgins you know they're
[19:10] all still dependent on you and I
[19:13] and that was the statement I was making
[19:14] Sunday about that see nobody anywhere
[19:18] ever has went through what the Lord
[19:20] Jesus did but we must do it he went
[19:23] through death burial Resurrection change
[19:27] of the body and sailed all through the
[19:29] hour in a Rapture all right
[19:32] but we even the foolish virgins can't do
[19:35] it the 144 000 that will receive the
[19:38] Holy Ghost Hereafter we leave but it
[19:41] still will not make them Sons and
[19:43] Daughters of God it'll make them
[19:44] servants to the bride we know that all
[19:47] right you see nobody can do that with
[19:49] you and I
[19:51] all right then you see the whole scope
[19:53] everything before us as their day is
[19:57] come and gone and there was somebody to
[20:00] live in that day
[20:01] all right but see to you and I
[20:05] we must come to the place
[20:08] to where we see who we are and what
[20:10] we're doing here and the prophet said
[20:12] when the bride realizes who she is and
[20:16] what she's here for
[20:18] he said nothing will be able to stand in
[20:20] their way
[20:22] well see you can read that to people
[20:27] I'm not throwing off on people I just
[20:29] honest it coming down through time I
[20:31] remember you know wrote around him he'd
[20:33] get up and he'd say
[20:35] I take every spirit in this building
[20:38] under my control
[20:41] well you know I believe it
[20:44] but uh a brother got up one time and he
[20:47] said I take every spirit in this
[20:49] building under my control
[20:52] I didn't believe him
[20:57] I'm just talking I didn't believe him
[20:58] you know why God I've seen things about
[21:01] even though things about him that wasn't
[21:03] under control
[21:05] well I'm just honest
[21:08] but see he was making a statement right
[21:12] I can go in the Bible and read you the
[21:15] Bible and say that is thus saith the
[21:19] Lord by his stripes you are healed
[21:24] I don't have to have a prophet to say it
[21:26] I don't have to have God to come down
[21:28] and say it I can read it for myself
[21:31] but until that's quickened to you amen
[21:36] come on that's right until it's
[21:38] quickened to me it's only a quote
[21:43] a mighty Goodwin that's good but only a
[21:46] quote that's right but when it comes off
[21:49] the pages is that the way the prophet
[21:50] said it said this Bible could be
[21:53] questioned
[21:55] as long as it's laying on the pages of
[21:57] the book
[21:58] he said but when it comes off of those
[21:59] pages
[22:02] it could never be questioned anymore why
[22:04] because it's alive this word has got to
[22:07] be made Alive by somebody
[22:10] well somebody's going to stand here in
[22:12] the last days and look death in the eye
[22:14] and life at it
[22:17] the prophet would say brush it off your
[22:19] sleeves you know
[22:22] and just not even be worried about it
[22:25] well now we're going to have to go
[22:27] through some of these things so
[22:30] we're not going to spend that much time
[22:31] in it tonight but my point is if we
[22:34] don't know what death is how are we
[22:36] going to know when it's destroyed
[22:39] well that's easy brother Dale and be
[22:42] destroyed when we walk out of here well
[22:44] then nobody will have to tell me
[22:47] right
[22:48] just to Gail if you walk out of here
[22:49] tonight nobody don't have to tell you
[22:51] you ain't gonna die
[22:53] you know what I mean you go excited up
[22:55] through the hour as a young person
[22:56] nobody don't have to preach your sermon
[22:58] that's right that's right all right
[23:00] but see
[23:02] the prophet said
[23:05] that we must confess
[23:10] that we're healed
[23:12] before we can before he can heal us
[23:15] because he's making intercession from
[23:16] our confession all right
[23:19] so then if I don't say I'm Healed
[23:22] then he can't heal me whose fault is it
[23:25] then well now I I just really don't I
[23:28] believe I'm Healed I believe I'm Healed
[23:30] but I I just don't believe it heals my
[23:33] sickness
[23:36] well
[23:37] there's death
[23:40] we'll get to those things but what I
[23:42] want us to deal with tonight is the one
[23:44] thing
[23:46] because as I read
[23:50] we know the Bible says The Last Enemy
[23:53] to be destroyed
[23:55] is death
[23:57] all right you know plain language now
[23:59] that don't need a light bulb to turn on
[24:01] that means death is not destroyed
[24:06] in some way
[24:08] something's wrong
[24:11] all right now we're sensible enough
[24:14] reasonable enough
[24:16] to think about
[24:18] that we're getting older
[24:21] and that we're dying
[24:24] that shouldn't need a great big light
[24:26] bulb turned on and
[24:27] a great Revelation well I just got a
[24:30] revelation I'm dying
[24:33] I don't want that revelation
[24:36] do you understand me if I got a
[24:40] revelation I'm dying you know what I'm
[24:42] going to die
[24:43] no I'm not going to be changed I'm going
[24:45] to die all right but think about it now
[24:50] see you would say but I thought Jesus
[24:53] Christ
[24:55] destroyed death at Calvary
[24:59] and that's 100 correct
[25:05] but we know for a certainty that we're
[25:08] still dying
[25:11] that's a certainty
[25:13] well what it is we need to get this all
[25:15] to where where we can just get it out of
[25:17] our mind you know we'll go to the what
[25:19] is it Christian sciences and different
[25:21] things like that you know
[25:23] you know
[25:25] get a great positive attitude that we're
[25:28] not sick
[25:29] I was just reading today where the
[25:31] prophet of God said
[25:32] when you're sick you're sick
[25:36] which you know what most people don't
[25:38] say you're sick cause you bring it up he
[25:40] said you're already sick
[25:47] well yeah we get it all into a great
[25:49] thing that we think is a great
[25:50] Supernatural thought
[25:53] that we're just going to think we're not
[25:54] sick
[25:56] but that ain't gonna help no
[25:58] just go ahead and thank you you're not
[25:59] gonna get no older
[26:04] is that going to solve the problem
[26:07] how do you well I was 74 but I'm not no
[26:11] older
[26:12] how many well it's been five years but
[26:14] I'm still 74. now that ain't even common
[26:16] sense
[26:17] right let alone Revelation but we thank
[26:20] those those things are in that order all
[26:23] right
[26:24] but now let's take some things that said
[26:27] and I like to do this I like to take
[26:29] something that's said over here
[26:31] something that said over here and and by
[26:34] on you know by allowing the Holy Spirit
[26:38] to bring it together and you'll see a
[26:42] beautiful picture
[26:43] and that way you don't have to
[26:45] understand everything that away and
[26:47] everything that away but you just
[26:49] understand what you understand
[26:51] all right because that's the way the
[26:53] Lord deals with us all right go ahead
[26:55] and pull up number I was telling them
[26:57] Sunday we I was going to tell them it
[26:59] wasn't their fault Sunday about all of
[27:01] the problems with it with the quotes
[27:05] I gave them the mornings quotes and
[27:07] thought I gave them the afternoon quotes
[27:08] at one time and come find out I didn't
[27:11] do it
[27:12] so they were back there trying to find
[27:14] out what I was talking about
[27:16] and they finally got back together but I
[27:18] told them at night I said we're going to
[27:20] start right here all right go ahead and
[27:21] pull up number one which is taken from
[27:23] Hebrews
[27:24] chapter 2.
[27:27] in Jeffersonville Indiana 1957 8 25 in
[27:30] the evening now look at what your
[27:32] Prophet says
[27:33] and listen
[27:36] we're on the eighth verse
[27:38] then shall he put then has he put all
[27:41] things into subjection
[27:44] under his feet pharah he put all things
[27:47] in subjection under his feet he left
[27:49] nothing that is not under his feet but
[27:51] now we see not all things put under him
[27:57] that's death
[27:59] we don't see death yet
[28:02] because we're still dying we see death
[28:04] not verse but we see Jesus
[28:09] all right
[28:10] now we don't see death destroyed
[28:15] not saying it wasn't destroyed
[28:18] but we don't see it
[28:21] as the point of being destroyed because
[28:23] we're talking about the physical part
[28:27] all right
[28:29] now by the new birth
[28:33] the soul has already been made eternal
[28:38] all right and can never die
[28:41] all right we know that's true right
[28:45] that's the purpose of the new birth or
[28:47] the impartation of the Life of Christ
[28:50] you know
[28:51] to put us to a place that we can stand
[28:54] here
[28:56] and be able to say what he says and
[28:59] understand it because he
[29:02] and and we read in Hebrews
[29:04] to an eight and we read it there
[29:07] you know coming down to it
[29:10] he has put all things in subjection on
[29:12] his feet for in that he put
[29:14] that he put all in subjection under him
[29:17] he left nothing
[29:20] that is not put under him
[29:24] all right
[29:26] he left nothing
[29:29] that is not put under him all right but
[29:32] then the same man finishes the sentence
[29:34] but now we see not yet all things put
[29:37] under him
[29:39] event
[29:40] all right
[29:42] now is Paul that confused
[29:46] or is he correct
[29:49] so he goes on and he says
[29:51] but we see Jesus
[29:55] what is he saying
[29:58] we see he who conquered death
[30:03] all right
[30:05] we see that spiritual death has been
[30:08] destroyed
[30:11] all right
[30:13] we know physical death was destroyed in
[30:16] Jesus Christ
[30:20] he proved he had power over death
[30:26] because even before his death burial and
[30:28] Resurrection
[30:32] the dead was raised
[30:35] all right
[30:37] but the same man that was raised
[30:40] Lazarus
[30:42] went back and died again
[30:48] point then of Salvation was to just
[30:50] bring him back alive
[30:54] not to make him Eternal and even in Soul
[30:56] because Jesus Christ hadn't died yet
[31:00] all right but he could return him back
[31:03] to the position that he once lived in
[31:07] and bring him alive
[31:09] but the man died again see
[31:11] all right
[31:12] see showing that death was not done away
[31:14] with but we see Jesus
[31:18] we see the one who conquered death amen
[31:23] amen now as far as God is concerned
[31:26] it's over with
[31:28] right
[31:30] all right
[31:32] now I hope you're following me and
[31:34] followed the point then
[31:37] and then on the day of Pentecost when
[31:39] the Holy Ghost came
[31:42] it made the soul of that 120
[31:46] near per room and in the 3000 later it
[31:49] made it eternal
[31:51] so death was annihilated for the soul
[31:55] if we accept it
[31:58] right if we receive it
[32:00] it would have done away for everybody
[32:04] death for the soul was not done away
[32:06] forever the opportunity for everybody to
[32:09] be saved
[32:10] was made
[32:13] but it wasn't applied to everybody
[32:16] it was only applied to a group of people
[32:18] right
[32:21] but see then that way we have eternal
[32:23] life death has been destroyed by the new
[32:27] birth
[32:29] all right
[32:32] and I'll read to you at a while where
[32:33] the Prophet says
[32:35] why should we be afraid of it
[32:43] why should we be afraid of it
[32:47] well I'm getting older well so what that
[32:50] means I'm one more day closer to being
[32:51] there
[32:53] huh
[32:56] but you see what we do a lot of times we
[32:59] get
[33:01] enough salvation maybe you call it
[33:05] until we don't want to go to hell
[33:08] you know
[33:10] so we'll kind of hold on to that you
[33:12] know that we don't want to go to hell
[33:15] but we don't move over in enough of it
[33:17] to be able to
[33:19] see and set us free
[33:22] and thereby can't bring us to a positive
[33:24] attitude if we don't do that
[33:27] all right
[33:30] but Jesus Christ destroyed death
[33:35] now listen to my point and you if you
[33:37] don't you totally misunderstand me
[33:40] he destroyed death
[33:45] his death destroyed death
[33:50] it annihilated death
[33:52] right
[33:53] but yet it wasn't applied to mankind
[33:56] in every form
[33:59] it was only applied to the soul of man
[34:02] because that would be the way it would
[34:04] have to come down
[34:05] huh
[34:07] and see then in the end time it would
[34:09] come to a marvelous situation
[34:13] you remember how we kept on the other
[34:14] week talking about how that he went to
[34:17] the father's strong spirit and brother
[34:19] Ron said that he was not on here strong
[34:24] Revelations 5 4 there he's not on his
[34:27] throne his throne is the millennium
[34:30] son of David
[34:33] but he's on the father's Throne which is
[34:35] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[34:37] prophet said through seven Church ages
[34:39] all right your new birth gave eternal
[34:42] life to the soul of mankind but it
[34:44] didn't give eternal life to the body
[34:49] see it didn't come to the body
[34:52] all right
[34:54] so then we can make a total conclusion
[34:57] of the entire matter and say what
[34:59] Jesus Christ destroyed death
[35:02] but to some part of that has not been
[35:04] applied to you and I yet
[35:07] because we're still dying but yet the
[35:10] new birth
[35:13] right
[35:15] so you see why Paul emphatically States
[35:19] but we see Jesus
[35:23] we see the opportunity
[35:27] now come in this message and I started
[35:29] studying the prophet and listening to
[35:31] him
[35:32] you know how it is and even now today so
[35:34] I'm in the message still doing you know
[35:36] or we're going to get a new body
[35:40] you know that's old denominational
[35:42] Doctrine we're going to get a new body
[35:46] well
[35:50] why
[35:52] would we get a new body
[35:54] right
[35:55] I mean what's the purpose of it right
[35:57] and where are you going to get it from
[36:03] all right
[36:05] see then we think well you know no no no
[36:07] no no brother Dale
[36:09] we gonna get a new body grandma taught
[36:11] me that grandpa taught me that
[36:12] so-and-sort
[36:14] yeah
[36:17] and you know what they put in US
[36:20] unbelief
[36:22] in God's word because God's word never
[36:24] talked about getting a new body
[36:27] never know her
[36:30] you see the one thing brother random
[36:31] would say would be enough
[36:33] just one point he said if if you drop a
[36:36] book you pick up something else that's
[36:37] not bringing that back he said then if
[36:40] if you lay that down see and it don't
[36:43] come back up
[36:45] you got something different
[36:49] and with Jesus being raised with nail
[36:51] prints in his hands
[36:53] three amen
[36:55] is enough to realize we don't get a new
[36:57] body
[36:58] amen we get this body made new right
[37:01] all right that's the thing that's not
[37:03] been applied
[37:06] it's not been applied to this man out
[37:08] here come on
[37:10] and how wonderful to understand
[37:13] this end time message
[37:15] and see that down Through the Ages
[37:19] mankind has wondered about things
[37:22] talked about things
[37:25] but then we had a prophet
[37:28] to come and tell us
[37:32] and we are to return to the original
[37:33] word
[37:37] see then we can talk about
[37:40] going off in Rapture because really
[37:42] there's no need I've told you years ago
[37:43] there's no need to talk about a Rapture
[37:45] you talk about a resurrection first
[37:47] because according to my Bible the dead
[37:49] in Christ's going to rise first then we
[37:51] which are alive and remain be changed
[37:52] and go away so where it shouldn't even
[37:54] be concerned with
[37:55] Rapture at the moment we should be
[37:58] concerned with Resurrection
[38:00] all right then Resurrection would have
[38:03] to put a connecting link
[38:06] to those that are to be raised
[38:10] that are in the grave
[38:11] all right
[38:13] and see that connecting link is a
[38:14] revealed word
[38:18] so I believe what Martin Luther talked
[38:21] I believe that Joshua live by faith
[38:24] I believe what Wesley taught is
[38:25] sanctification I believe the
[38:27] Pentecostals the restoration of the
[38:29] gifts
[38:31] I believe in that
[38:33] right
[38:34] because that's part of the word
[38:37] all right and see then we should go on
[38:39] through it but now coming down to this
[38:42] then
[38:43] let's think about it for a minute
[38:48] he was made a little lower than the
[38:50] angels to be able to taste death
[38:54] you say well my God can't die I know all
[38:57] that quote's all right go ahead
[39:00] but also know that he acted departed
[39:02] death when he climbed upon the cross and
[39:04] died that's the unveiling of God
[39:07] little run said he acted departed death
[39:10] one because that life was released out
[39:12] of that body and the body died
[39:14] all right
[39:15] all right see then we thank God for the
[39:17] truth to be able to set it in order
[39:19] but what is going to bring to pass
[39:25] the changes of these bodies
[39:27] right
[39:30] all right now the resurrection ain't
[39:32] going to change you
[39:35] because if you're alive it's not
[39:36] Resurrection that's right
[39:39] that's right all right
[39:41] it might be Resurrection from our old
[39:43] denominational beliefs yeah
[39:45] but not a physical Resurrection
[39:47] but I think we need to comprehend and
[39:49] understand that why he would go on to
[39:52] say
[39:53] we don't see all these things
[39:55] but we see Jesus
[39:59] see then my hopes my all is based on
[40:02] whether he raised
[40:07] whether he raised
[40:11] because without his resurrection there's
[40:13] no good of any of us talking about a
[40:15] resurrection rats or anything
[40:20] now in doing that then let's think about
[40:23] tonight the point hold it
[40:26] it's physical death
[40:29] mortality life which moral means death
[40:32] doomed all right
[40:34] and this is this is called mortal it's
[40:37] death doomed all right
[40:39] going to a place to be
[40:42] Immortal or eternal
[40:45] all right
[40:46] now in doing that then if we don't see
[40:50] first
[40:52] Jesus
[40:54] and what he went through
[40:56] and what he done
[40:57] then how can we see what we're to do
[41:01] all right
[41:04] see he went through death burial
[41:07] Resurrection he conquered death right
[41:11] right all right
[41:14] but he only applied it to the Soul on
[41:16] the death Pentecost
[41:20] see the end time message
[41:22] is the part to apply it to the body
[41:27] that's why the mystery was never known
[41:29] by mankind down through the ages of what
[41:31] was going on but then here comes a
[41:33] little old man walking out there and
[41:35] probably maybe the first or second
[41:37] sermon he preaches and you know
[41:40] 47 I think was the first to have on the
[41:43] record part of it and shortly thereafter
[41:45] wrote around starts talking about son of
[41:48] man
[41:52] you know
[41:53] well nobody didn't even know what Son of
[41:55] God was they had it all messed up as
[41:57] trinitarianism
[41:59] but he starts talking about son of man
[42:04] well because it's going to have to come
[42:05] to that position of understanding that
[42:08] because son of man is word
[42:12] made
[42:13] flesh
[42:17] so when a man is not Son of God
[42:19] dispensation
[42:23] Son of God dispensation is a baptism of
[42:25] the Holy Ghost in our hearts and lives
[42:27] by the new birth
[42:28] son of man comes down to dealing with
[42:31] the word made flesh
[42:35] now why would it have to deal with the
[42:36] word made flesh
[42:39] because the flesh is the problem
[42:42] the flesh is the part that's not that
[42:45] the Redemption has not been applied unto
[42:47] him
[42:54] why are you dying that's right
[42:58] If That Ain't Enough
[43:01] oh I know you're really not dying
[43:04] well go comb your hair over on the other
[43:06] side and part it some way and
[43:08] met a boy at school he
[43:11] he you know this is back now I'm talking
[43:12] about 1955.
[43:15] and this boy lost a lot of hair
[43:17] well he he went down you know and they
[43:19] hadn't got into a lot of this
[43:21] um
[43:22] sprig plant never what you call it they
[43:24] do now but
[43:26] you know back then so he goes to this
[43:30] people
[43:31] and oh they
[43:33] they show him what to do
[43:35] and he come back to school and
[43:37] he looked like he had to hit her
[43:42] you know I mean not totally but look
[43:45] better than it did
[43:47] all it was is give him a bunch of moose
[43:49] or what you call it and stuff you know
[43:51] and thickened it up in that form and
[43:53] then just pushed it around where it
[43:54] wouldn't show the bald spots I laughed
[43:57] and told him I said it didn't do you no
[43:59] good
[44:03] he went back all we want to did all this
[44:05] at now it ain't gonna do us no good
[44:06] until the reality comes
[44:09] all right so now let's think about him
[44:12] did Jesus Christ
[44:16] pay the price in full
[44:21] right all right
[44:22] if he paid the price in full then we're
[44:25] not asking him to climb up on the cross
[44:27] and die again
[44:32] why because we finished it
[44:34] when he said on Calvary it is finished
[44:35] that was it
[44:37] right all right
[44:40] now
[44:41] but yet we've got to look into the word
[44:46] to see that
[44:48] for certainty and follow that line
[44:51] that
[44:52] it's these bodies that is the end time
[44:57] it's these bodies the Redemption of the
[45:00] body right
[45:02] right has got to come
[45:05] if not you're just like we wasn't
[45:07] organized religion well what did it
[45:09] matter can't go to a smoker a drangler
[45:11] because it don't matter I'm going to get
[45:13] me a new body
[45:16] well
[45:18] all right
[45:21] but if we can see what Jesus done
[45:26] and see the part that was applied
[45:30] and see that they were some part of that
[45:32] that was not applied
[45:35] but will be applied in the end time
[45:37] you will value this message more than
[45:40] you ever thought of in your life
[45:45] if you ever really see this message
[45:50] you remember what we'd bring out the
[45:51] other day we're there in in Timothy
[45:54] that life and immortality is brought to
[45:57] light through the gospel
[46:01] all right
[46:03] you can see there is a hope
[46:08] me
[46:09] was that what job said
[46:12] is there a hope for man I see the tree
[46:14] he comes back I see this come back but
[46:16] he said man lays down he gives up the
[46:18] ghosts he's gone
[46:22] but one day he seen he'd raise
[46:25] him then he had a better understanding
[46:27] didn't he
[46:31] listen to what your Prophet has to cover
[46:34] and then think about it go ahead with
[46:37] number three brother
[46:39] this is from the message the Great and
[46:41] Mighty conqueror preaching 57.
[46:45] 4 21.
[46:47] what was it
[46:52] okay hurry up
[46:54] come on up
[46:59] yes
[47:01] that's the last part come back up what
[47:03] was it corruption right here we got it
[47:05] come back up I just didn't underline
[47:06] some of this
[47:07] roll it all back up a little the other
[47:10] way okay now we got it what was it
[47:12] corruption knew its micro
[47:14] the soul knew its master
[47:16] and that Great and Mighty conqueror
[47:18] proved there that he was he has the
[47:22] power of death
[47:24] death and hell and the grave
[47:27] now he proved that all right sure it
[47:30] Thrills our heart you talk about
[47:35] hey
[47:36] dish pans and blowing horns
[47:39] the world ought to be in a jubilee this
[47:43] morning
[47:43] like it never has been the screams and
[47:47] the shouts of his people because this is
[47:50] the Memorial Day that when he conquered
[47:53] The Last Enemy and set we kept his free
[48:00] now he conquered The Last Enemy
[48:06] but Paul in Corinthians says The Last
[48:08] Enemy is not destroyed
[48:11] right right
[48:15] so now it's got to be something
[48:17] different from what we're thinking
[48:18] because
[48:20] so then you're it's the way you apply it
[48:24] he conquered death he's not going to die
[48:26] again
[48:28] he conquered it
[48:31] all right
[48:32] if we can see that we'll see one of
[48:34] these days out of to do away with death
[48:36] all right
[48:37] he conquered it remember he conquered
[48:41] The Last Enemy
[48:45] but yet when he speaks back through his
[48:47] Prophet messenger Paul
[48:49] he said the lies the enemy is not
[48:51] destroyed
[48:53] Paul when that probably come to him for
[48:55] him to speak
[48:57] he probably his head's probably spun
[48:59] around and around him
[49:03] he says now Lord
[49:07] something's wrong here
[49:10] it may have been a while between the
[49:12] Hebrews and the Corinthians
[49:14] in the writings of the letters
[49:17] but eventually it got there
[49:20] he said we don't see everything
[49:22] in a way but we see Jesus
[49:26] you come to that point
[49:28] of understanding
[49:31] so that's what me and you need to do
[49:33] but look what he says now from the
[49:34] restoration of the Bride tree number
[49:35] four
[49:37] preaching 62.
[49:39] 422 paragraph 48.
[49:42] he had triumphed over sickness diseases
[49:45] and all kinds of devils and Powers
[49:49] then death laid before him
[49:52] the Great
[49:54] and Last Enemy
[49:56] and on Easter morning he proved he was
[49:59] God
[50:00] he rose from even the light Rose from
[50:03] Evil And The Last Enemy could not hold
[50:06] him the grave gave him up hell had to
[50:09] give him him forth heaven received him
[50:13] he conquered it
[50:17] he conquered death
[50:21] amen all right
[50:23] but then
[50:25] we would go back and read things like
[50:27] this go ahead to number five
[50:32] it's just so bad that's taken from
[50:35] God talked to Moses
[50:38] it's so bad
[50:40] when poor little children have in
[50:42] suffering have to suffer like that won't
[50:46] it be a wonderful day when that last
[50:48] enemy is put under his feet
[50:53] now he just said
[50:55] it was totally annihilated
[50:59] now he's saying
[51:02] so you know what he sounds like Paul
[51:04] don't he
[51:07] right
[51:09] don't he sound like Paul is Paul
[51:10] speaking that the last enemy's not
[51:12] destroyed and then he turns around and
[51:14] said but we see everything put under him
[51:18] but then it strikes him and he said but
[51:20] now wait a minute there's something I'll
[51:21] put under him yet
[51:23] but said we see Jesus
[51:27] see we see Jesus
[51:29] that life's enemy
[51:32] when that last enemy is put under his
[51:34] feet
[51:35] which what he goes on now to the faith
[51:37] of Abraham number six
[51:40] some glorious day that Last Enemy I have
[51:44] which is death
[51:45] will be trapped right under the feet
[51:49] as with the Conqueror we shall March
[51:52] through the city
[51:55] what is The Last Enemy to be destroyed
[51:58] death
[52:00] words are dying at in flesh
[52:03] could a born-again person doesn't die
[52:07] even an unborn again person doesn't die
[52:10] like annihilating
[52:11] right
[52:12] even they must go to a place and wait
[52:16] but look what he goes on to say
[52:20] look at number seven the mighty
[52:21] conqueror
[52:25] he said father these are those that
[52:28] believed on you
[52:29] I've conquered both death hell in the
[52:33] grave
[52:35] now that's his raising up when he was
[52:37] going up you know Everlasting Gates and
[52:39] all the time and he said father these
[52:42] are those that believed on you I've
[52:44] conquered both death hell in the grave
[52:46] and I can hear the father say
[52:50] Ed sit on my throne here son until I
[52:54] made The Last Enemy thy footstool and
[52:58] Jesus signed upon the throne and to
[53:00] right hand of God and said he's there
[53:02] tonight
[53:04] now what's he talking about then
[53:09] the life enemy to be to be made his
[53:11] footstool look at the next one let's
[53:13] read it as the eagle stirth his death
[53:15] number eight
[53:16] all right
[53:18] all right now we can pray for people
[53:22] God can call now the Bible said that
[53:24] he's the same yesterday today and
[53:26] forever is that right and if he's the
[53:28] same he has to be the same
[53:30] as principle the same in power the only
[53:34] thing is his body is sitting at the
[53:36] right hand of God we all believe that
[53:38] he's sitting at the right hand of God on
[53:41] God strong
[53:43] that's not his strong he's coming back
[53:45] to Reign on his strong it's the Throne
[53:47] of David because we know that's where
[53:49] the promise was made he said take it
[53:51] strong he's sitting on God's Throne
[53:53] waiting till the last enemy is made his
[53:55] footstool he will return someday bring
[53:59] the precious Souls with him to take on
[54:02] immortality to live in a glorified body
[54:05] live through the Millennium leave
[54:07] forever all right
[54:10] right
[54:11] if it's
[54:15] if it's not that death is still raining
[54:18] why does it have to be a resurrection
[54:25] that should solve a lot of problems
[54:32] if we're going to get a new one
[54:36] there's no relationship to this well why
[54:38] is there Resurrection
[54:42] I mean you mean all down through the
[54:44] ages one day there's going to be the
[54:45] resurrection then they're going to throw
[54:47] that away and get them a new one
[54:50] that only makes sense
[54:53] I hope you listen to that
[54:56] you know sometimes the Lord does speak
[54:59] through dumb donkeys you know
[55:02] but see The Last Enemy
[55:05] is natural physical death
[55:09] that's what we're doing
[55:14] death
[55:19] is taking you and I
[55:23] let's read this last one then we'll get
[55:25] off this possessing the gates of his
[55:26] Innings number nine
[55:28] a Royal King when he come born of a
[55:32] virgin he conquered every enemy even to
[55:36] death
[55:38] so death itself cannot scare the Seed of
[55:41] Abraham
[55:43] we have the promise that will inherit
[55:45] the earth
[55:46] and shall return again in a more
[55:48] glorious way in the glorified body after
[55:51] The Last Enemy is placed under foot of
[55:53] the only and last child of God that
[55:57] shall come into the kingdom
[55:58] now if you want to know when the
[56:00] resurrection is coming he just told you
[56:06] he just told you in the resurrection
[56:08] gonna come after the last minute is
[56:10] placed under foot not for everybody
[56:14] the only and lifestyle of God
[56:18] you remember the prophet and all other
[56:21] seals and the thing when the lamb leaves
[56:23] The Mercy Seat
[56:25] he comes down here
[56:27] redemption's over
[56:30] hey
[56:31] that's why everybody thought it was over
[56:33] with when he preached the seals he
[56:34] didn't say that
[56:36] here is the answer to it when the last
[56:38] child he said comes in and reads you see
[56:40] a book and see if that's not what he's
[56:42] saying
[56:43] when the last one comes in
[56:45] he said he'll raise and come
[56:48] all right
[56:49] but I want you to think about it
[56:55] you said but
[56:59] what about this last enemy
[57:04] that we call death
[57:07] because I said now I'm get to point to
[57:09] you before we go on with what I want to
[57:11] say
[57:13] I can cut your head off
[57:16] but I can't kill you
[57:19] right
[57:21] because even a sinner
[57:23] lives on somewhere
[57:27] and a Christian lives on somewhere
[57:29] so
[57:31] death that we better be concerned about
[57:33] is this part of dying
[57:35] right because if you're con if you are a
[57:37] born-again Christian why would you be
[57:40] concerned with death
[57:43] because it's already annihilated to you
[57:46] because he annihilated it and he come
[57:49] and lived in you to prove it's over here
[57:51] right
[57:54] so the flesh is what we're dealing with
[57:57] well I said then if if you can't see it
[57:59] then maybe it's been 40 something years
[58:01] of me studying that's made it that way
[58:03] but
[58:05] to see this message
[58:09] comes to deal with this man
[58:13] they had to baptism with the Holy Ghost
[58:15] each age had the new birth
[58:18] and they even the disciples had from
[58:20] here down
[58:22] call the face of the fathers
[58:25] well yet they were still dying
[58:29] and I told you Paul then would say
[58:31] a nice enemy to be destroyed is death
[58:35] but then when he gets over in
[58:36] Thessalonians
[58:39] he said the Lord still descend from
[58:41] heaven with a shout
[58:45] voice of an archangel and trumpet
[58:48] stay
[58:50] you see church it's this day
[58:54] this bride in the end time is going to
[58:57] take that death away from Satan
[59:03] now he's already made the way he's
[59:05] already proved it can be done
[59:08] right
[59:11] what do we be worried about I've got a
[59:12] few quotes I want to read you here in
[59:14] just a minute
[59:15] you know death is my
[59:18] helper
[59:23] wait a minute
[59:26] death is my helper
[59:32] all right
[59:34] let's get on over the message a little
[59:36] all right
[59:39] but what about this great Apostle Paul
[59:45] that come down to the last part of his
[59:47] road and was laying there in a jail cell
[59:53] in Iraq's an outstanding statement
[59:58] he's fixing to get his head cut off
[1:00:04] that's when he said
[1:00:05] death where's your sting grave where's
[1:00:07] your victory
[1:00:11] because you know what he saw Jesus
[1:00:17] now come on see we don't read like we
[1:00:19] used to read in the in the denomination
[1:00:21] that I used to read where Paul was
[1:00:23] talking about you know the different
[1:00:25] things and it looked like you know that
[1:00:27] it would be that he was expecting the
[1:00:28] Lord to come right then you know in
[1:00:31] other words I've said this today and
[1:00:33] tomorrow he's going to be here that's
[1:00:34] what we talked
[1:00:37] but brother random said
[1:00:39] that God was trying to get out of the
[1:00:42] Mind through the Apostle Paul
[1:00:45] that the Rapture and the things was
[1:00:47] coming right then because he said there
[1:00:49] must be a falling away first
[1:00:55] we thought right opposite right
[1:00:59] but he said he's trying to get it out of
[1:01:01] the mind to the people that he was
[1:01:02] coming right then
[1:01:05] Paul could look down
[1:01:07] 2000 years and see the falling away
[1:01:12] the biggest falling away is the people
[1:01:13] of this message
[1:01:16] but now think about it let's read what
[1:01:19] he'd actually said
[1:01:21] the waiver of random see we read it you
[1:01:23] know Dan where are you staying great
[1:01:25] let's read it the way he said it all
[1:01:27] right go ahead brothers and let's pick
[1:01:28] up number 11.
[1:01:30] we've dropped off a few of these quotes
[1:01:31] but we'll
[1:01:34] even Saul when he had
[1:01:37] when he had to get rid of his armor now
[1:01:41] remember this is Paul
[1:01:44] calling it Saul you know all right
[1:01:48] he took off the Ecclesia classical armor
[1:01:52] he did like David did but when Saul come
[1:01:55] to the end of the road
[1:01:58] he said
[1:02:00] I fought a good fight
[1:02:04] that was The Last Enemy to conquer
[1:02:12] he said yeah but wait a minute Paul
[1:02:13] wasn't
[1:02:15] you're not listening
[1:02:19] see Paul saw death destroyed
[1:02:24] I'm talking about here
[1:02:29] he wasn't just talking about himself he
[1:02:31] saw it done here that's what your
[1:02:33] prophet's saying
[1:02:36] come on read it he said I fought a good
[1:02:39] fight that was The Last Enemy to conquer
[1:02:44] come on
[1:02:46] I fought a good fight I finished my
[1:02:48] course I kept the faith henceforth
[1:02:50] there's laid up for me a crown that the
[1:02:52] Lord the righteous judge will give me at
[1:02:54] that day said not only me but all them
[1:02:57] who love his appearing
[1:03:00] oh death
[1:03:01] said
[1:03:03] here's what Dad said but I'll get you in
[1:03:06] a few minutes
[1:03:08] and the grave said I'll mold you out
[1:03:11] under
[1:03:12] you know without rotten you
[1:03:15] he said oh death where's your sting
[1:03:18] grave where's your victory
[1:03:21] I know I'm laying here in this Roman
[1:03:24] dungeon Bound in Chains
[1:03:28] my wrists and hands
[1:03:30] and I I got 39 stripes across my back
[1:03:34] I'm here with tears scalding my eyes
[1:03:38] until I can't see no more
[1:03:41] see my naps with my natural eye
[1:03:45] but I can see a crown of righteousness
[1:03:47] laid up our chunder
[1:03:49] my ankles are worn out
[1:03:54] I fell off so much from the old molded
[1:03:57] bread they throw it in here and the Rats
[1:04:00] has thrown over me and the spiders and
[1:04:03] things don't sound like a conqueror
[1:04:06] well I'm weak
[1:04:10] but he could stand in the face of death
[1:04:13] and say
[1:04:17] where is your Steam
[1:04:19] grave where is your victory
[1:04:22] with chains shaking on his hands
[1:04:24] Hallelujah that's what we need Grave
[1:04:27] where's your Victory the grave said I'll
[1:04:29] rotten you Paul he said but thanks be to
[1:04:33] God I've already got the victory through
[1:04:36] our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:41] he may be right then realize what he had
[1:04:45] spoke of in Thessalonians
[1:04:52] when he said the Lord himself shall
[1:04:54] descend from heaven
[1:04:59] saw death destroyed but yet he was still
[1:05:01] dying
[1:05:05] somebody is going to see death destroyed
[1:05:11] and you know what it's going to come to
[1:05:12] pass
[1:05:14] because you see it wasn't applied back
[1:05:16] there to do away with the natural dying
[1:05:19] it was applied to the soul of mankind to
[1:05:22] give him a new birth to give him eternal
[1:05:24] life in his soul and that he lived
[1:05:27] through that through seven Church ages
[1:05:29] for 2000 years and God would send down a
[1:05:32] prophet that could take all of those
[1:05:34] scriptures and bring them together it's
[1:05:37] like what a red diary how perfect could
[1:05:39] a man write than what was written to her
[1:05:42] man
[1:05:44] of the horrible situation but the demand
[1:05:47] says death where's he staying grave
[1:05:50] where's your victory
[1:05:54] you know what they come along was that
[1:05:56] the one or was it Peter which one was it
[1:05:59] where the boy was concerned he said you
[1:06:00] know you're dying he said what
[1:06:04] they called his name wouldn't it Peter
[1:06:06] he said here I am or maybe Paul won
[1:06:14] you see when we're afraid of death
[1:06:15] that's our problem
[1:06:20] that's our problem when we're afraid of
[1:06:22] death
[1:06:23] let's read what your Prophet said and
[1:06:25] let's see if it's the attitude
[1:06:28] now let's see if your Prophet comes to
[1:06:33] the point of speaking in different
[1:06:35] wordings but yet the same point
[1:06:39] that he said Paul
[1:06:41] stood there and said
[1:06:44] in the most horrible situation
[1:06:48] but yet look what he could say
[1:06:51] death where's you sting grave where's
[1:06:53] your Victory I'm not afraid of you
[1:07:02] you see when we're afraid of death it's
[1:07:03] done got us
[1:07:06] who wouldn't Arnold Von Winkler that
[1:07:08] took all those fears and grabbed them
[1:07:09] and run them into his belly and said
[1:07:11] this day I die
[1:07:13] for Switzerland
[1:07:16] you got past being afraid of dying
[1:07:24] come on
[1:07:25] look at the next one
[1:07:27] the way of a true prophet
[1:07:29] we have a true prophet of God 62.
[1:07:33] that's number 12.
[1:07:40] there ain't no bother no more
[1:07:45] death is nothing
[1:07:48] we got it
[1:07:50] it's ours
[1:07:55] oh no no it's the devils
[1:08:00] argue with the prophet
[1:08:02] no problem
[1:08:06] it can't control me
[1:08:11] I control it
[1:08:16] right
[1:08:20] the doctors will tell you to eat pork 24
[1:08:23] hours a day and you're going to
[1:08:24] eventually die with high blood pressure
[1:08:26] so you can control that
[1:08:29] you know how don't eat the pork
[1:08:32] right
[1:08:34] see we spend a lot of times on natural
[1:08:36] things but I want you to get the point
[1:08:39] it can't control me I control it
[1:08:43] how
[1:08:45] through him who made me an overcomer
[1:08:48] because I've already overcome death
[1:08:53] how did I do it
[1:08:56] by Believing on him
[1:09:02] you said well that's only speaking about
[1:09:03] death for the soul well I would wait a
[1:09:05] little bit
[1:09:07] death is in sin unbelief
[1:09:10] I'm not an unbeliever I'm a Believer
[1:09:13] I've raised from that thing resurrected
[1:09:16] it's the earnest of all my complete
[1:09:18] physical spiritual Resurrection
[1:09:22] meaning everything right
[1:09:24] everything yes sir you get it
[1:09:26] congregation says amen so we do have
[1:09:30] death under our control
[1:09:32] through Jesus Christ who has overcome
[1:09:35] death hail Grace sickness and sorrow
[1:09:37] everything else triumphed overall
[1:09:42] he said we don't have to buckle down to
[1:09:44] death
[1:09:48] all right
[1:09:51] death is going to take us it took the
[1:09:53] prophet
[1:09:56] right
[1:09:57] it's going to take us until something
[1:09:59] happens
[1:10:03] and that something happens to somebody
[1:10:07] who God can speak to
[1:10:12] and they believe it
[1:10:15] and they get away from their unbelief
[1:10:19] look what he says on how can I overcome
[1:10:23] number 13.
[1:10:25] but remember greater is he that's in you
[1:10:29] than he that's in the world
[1:10:32] you must realize
[1:10:36] that the Holy Spirit that's in that's in
[1:10:39] you has already overcome this thing
[1:10:43] and he's in you and you can overcome by
[1:10:45] him that's exactly sensible exactly the
[1:10:49] way the scripture is written overcoming
[1:10:51] he said I got a very look at the next
[1:10:53] one
[1:10:54] a couple more beer through
[1:10:58] without money or without price
[1:11:01] all right
[1:11:03] once I was a sinner Bound in sin
[1:11:07] with heartaches
[1:11:09] dreading death
[1:11:12] but today
[1:11:15] death is my victory
[1:11:21] now the Lord don't he
[1:11:24] Hallelujah
[1:11:26] it would only bring me in the presence
[1:11:28] of him
[1:11:29] I love
[1:11:31] that I can look upon his face
[1:11:33] he changed the thing by an operation he
[1:11:37] taken my heart and made it anew
[1:11:39] I know something happened to me
[1:11:43] death is my victory
[1:11:46] I like what old brother Carol said he
[1:11:48] said he said it sure because it sounded
[1:11:50] like him
[1:11:52] nobody said brother Carol you about 80
[1:11:53] or something like that and he said yep
[1:11:55] and said
[1:11:56] I'm either going by the grave I'm going
[1:11:58] up one pretty quick
[1:12:01] all right
[1:12:04] but you see if we're afraid of dying
[1:12:08] now we're not dumb stupid idiots
[1:12:12] maybe a little on the idiot side but not
[1:12:14] dumb
[1:12:15] we're not going to go out here and lay
[1:12:16] down in the middle of the road
[1:12:19] and say God's not going to let me die
[1:12:24] don't tempt him
[1:12:27] right
[1:12:31] be sensible
[1:12:33] all right
[1:12:36] look at the next one
[1:12:38] the flashing red lights of his coming
[1:12:42] paragraph 168.
[1:12:44] then I'll come on down until I can't get
[1:12:47] out
[1:12:48] of much here
[1:12:50] if you read he's got you know like I'm
[1:12:53] gonna be a grand ball Grant Grandpa I'm
[1:12:55] going to be there I'm getting old
[1:12:57] then one morning the fog will come into
[1:13:00] the room
[1:13:01] emotion across the border to death
[1:13:06] to come get me
[1:13:10] he can only take me by the hand and lead
[1:13:15] me across to my master
[1:13:18] every little man talk like that
[1:13:21] he is not
[1:13:24] my slave driver
[1:13:26] I am not his slave he is my slave
[1:13:32] Christ conquered death for me
[1:13:35] and only one thing he can do is pull me
[1:13:38] into the presence of my maker when this
[1:13:41] Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved you ever
[1:13:44] heard a man talk like that sounds like
[1:13:46] Paul don't it
[1:13:49] I come down and I get so old I can't do
[1:13:51] nothing I'm just sitting down in the
[1:13:53] chair
[1:13:56] you know
[1:13:58] I said a fog comes in the room and said
[1:14:01] emotion death come on
[1:14:05] you know that God cannot
[1:14:07] Satan cannot get you until God is
[1:14:10] through with you would you agree with
[1:14:11] that
[1:14:14] so why are we afraid of
[1:14:19] it
[1:14:20] I mean what are you afraid of
[1:14:25] now we're not stupid we're not taking a
[1:14:27] gun blow our head I'll get on over here
[1:14:28] quicker
[1:14:30] no no
[1:14:34] but do you think when brother Brown put
[1:14:36] that gun to his head if that gun had
[1:14:38] went off you know what he went right in
[1:14:40] the presence of God
[1:14:42] mid right
[1:14:44] oh of course we're still in the day
[1:14:47] where we believe that if you take your
[1:14:49] own life you lost
[1:14:51] veteran says no
[1:14:55] what would have happened had the bullets
[1:14:57] went off oh we know it couldn't happen
[1:15:00] amen I know it couldn't happen
[1:15:03] neither could death get into the man
[1:15:05] that would sit all set there until I get
[1:15:07] so old he said I'll have to call it and
[1:15:09] tell it to come on
[1:15:16] what are you afraid of
[1:15:20] if you're afraid of dying
[1:15:23] now come on we're sensible there was
[1:15:26] something about death that we don't
[1:15:27] understand it makes the human mortal
[1:15:29] react and everything else
[1:15:33] but yet
[1:15:36] why would we be afraid of it
[1:15:41] I'm afraid of dying
[1:15:45] cause you're not right
[1:15:48] right
[1:15:52] now you see the point I've been driving
[1:15:54] that
[1:15:56] that Paul could say the life enemy to be
[1:15:59] destroyed is death
[1:16:03] and we don't see death yet put under him
[1:16:05] because he's sitting on the throne at
[1:16:08] the time and he's got a raise to come
[1:16:10] this way
[1:16:15] for it to be totally annihilated then
[1:16:18] it'll only be annihilated for the bride
[1:16:20] that's right
[1:16:26] death is not I'm not his slave
[1:16:31] but brother Dale you're not afraid of
[1:16:33] dying I wish I was
[1:16:38] certain about a lot of things that I am
[1:16:40] about to have
[1:16:43] you know that I'm not worried
[1:16:45] you know who I live for you
[1:16:48] I live from my family
[1:16:50] I live for you
[1:16:53] is that Paul's understanding
[1:16:56] better for me to go on
[1:16:58] I want to go on but said no got to stay
[1:17:02] here
[1:17:03] got a job to do
[1:17:08] but if you're afraid of dying you've got
[1:17:10] problems you need in the Altar and get
[1:17:13] your salvation straight
[1:17:18] that's why I've tried my best to tell
[1:17:20] you about your children don't teach your
[1:17:23] children about a dirty mean God that
[1:17:25] hates them
[1:17:28] but don't tell them about a God that
[1:17:30] loves them so much he let them get by
[1:17:31] with anything either
[1:17:33] tell them the truth about it
[1:17:41] one more
[1:17:43] conflict between God and Satan preach
[1:17:45] 62.
[1:17:47] 5 31.
[1:17:51] but just think brother
[1:17:54] there isn't nothing
[1:17:56] he's talked about facing the setting of
[1:17:58] The Sun you know
[1:18:00] but your thing brother there isn't
[1:18:02] nothing but what we have
[1:18:04] we got love we got joy we got peace we
[1:18:08] got life we got we possess death
[1:18:13] that's right
[1:18:15] the Bible says we do we possess death
[1:18:19] it belongs to us we don't belong to it
[1:18:23] it belongs to us
[1:18:26] say
[1:18:27] what you going to do with death
[1:18:31] you know what are you going to do with
[1:18:33] that just like Paul said
[1:18:36] when he come knocking at the door
[1:18:40] said have you come to escort me across
[1:18:43] the river
[1:18:45] oh no no death is out there oh don't
[1:18:48] come in here where I'm at
[1:18:51] Paul said you've come to escort me
[1:18:53] across the river
[1:18:55] say it
[1:18:57] God hooked death to a buggy
[1:19:00] and the only thing it can do is pull you
[1:19:02] in the presence of God that's all can't
[1:19:06] die
[1:19:08] they just hitched up dead to a buggy and
[1:19:11] the only thing it do is pull you right
[1:19:14] up in the presence of God it's just a
[1:19:16] mascot
[1:19:18] to come to pull you across the river
[1:19:19] that's all it is and there's nothing
[1:19:21] going to bother us anymore Paul said
[1:19:24] when death come rolling down through
[1:19:26] this
[1:19:27] the time for him he said oh death where
[1:19:30] is your sting
[1:19:31] said well I'm going to take you out to
[1:19:33] the Grave
[1:19:35] he said then grave where is your Victory
[1:19:37] I possess you too
[1:19:40] then he turned around said thanks be to
[1:19:43] God who gives us a victory through our
[1:19:45] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:51] see the life's enemy is not destroyed
[1:19:54] yet
[1:19:54] but it was destroyed by Jesus Christ
[1:19:58] it wasn't applied back there and hasn't
[1:20:01] been applied to the ages
[1:20:05] all right
[1:20:07] there were people in brother branham's
[1:20:09] Ministry
[1:20:10] that were raised from the dead right
[1:20:13] now are you listening
[1:20:16] you know what everyone died
[1:20:18] or have died I guess because maybe he
[1:20:21] might have been in a child or something
[1:20:22] that we don't know the exact age of that
[1:20:24] when it was in Switzerland
[1:20:28] but they died
[1:20:32] proving that God had conquered death he
[1:20:35] brought him back to life
[1:20:38] but showing that death was still taking
[1:20:40] its toll they went by the grave
[1:20:46] well we're afraid
[1:20:52] come on out the fake plane
[1:20:55] we ain't gonna do a dumb thing and walk
[1:20:56] out there and sit down on the track and
[1:20:59] wait on the train to come by
[1:21:03] right
[1:21:06] we're not going to be like that
[1:21:10] but why should we worry
[1:21:12] the doctor comes in and says you're
[1:21:13] dying
[1:21:19] I will remind you that when a little
[1:21:22] girl just recently was put in the
[1:21:24] hospital in Atlanta
[1:21:27] she was in the Intensive Care Unit
[1:21:32] wasn't expecting her to live
[1:21:36] the mother and father left the child
[1:21:41] and come to the Bible study
[1:21:45] when a lot of you won't come
[1:21:55] that plain enough
[1:21:57] but yet you're in the message and yet
[1:21:59] you're ready for the change
[1:22:06] are we doing something in Bible study
[1:22:08] that's contrary to the word of God
[1:22:10] well I just don't have the time you got
[1:22:13] time for everything else
[1:22:16] don't tell me you're gonna miss that
[1:22:18] doctor's appointment Monday morning or
[1:22:20] Monday evening that he tells you to be
[1:22:23] there don't tell me you're going to miss
[1:22:25] that work that you're supposed to be
[1:22:27] there at eight o'clock Monday morning
[1:22:39] sorry
[1:22:40] but is it truth
[1:22:45] sister Trudy for 20 something years
[1:22:50] drove five hours
[1:22:53] four year
[1:22:55] four hours ago four hours
[1:22:58] to come here from
[1:23:00] from above Charlotte
[1:23:03] four hours to get to church
[1:23:08] more dedicated than 98 of what's in here
[1:23:13] take it
[1:23:16] till the day I was tired
[1:23:19] tired of playing
[1:23:21] it's time to be plain
[1:23:25] she'll be a witness against you that
[1:23:27] can't make it
[1:23:33] brother Dale you don't understand
[1:23:38] 20 years ago you wouldn't have said you
[1:23:40] don't understand
[1:23:41] because you would have been here
[1:23:44] yeah but I'm sick we pray for the sick
[1:23:54] and I got back trouble today she could
[1:23:57] have stayed at home
[1:24:01] and he
[1:24:07] under playing Church you say well you're
[1:24:09] just getting upset and getting picky do
[1:24:11] what you want to I don't care
[1:24:15] what I'm talking about death being
[1:24:17] destroyed
[1:24:18] that's not going to be destroyed by you
[1:24:21] laying at home in the bed
[1:24:23] and goofing off you can take that or
[1:24:26] leave it that's why the biggest portion
[1:24:28] of the people of this message I said
[1:24:30] this 30 something years ago are going to
[1:24:32] die and go by the grave and I did not
[1:24:35] mean it then and do not mean it now as a
[1:24:38] dechristianizing form I mean it as God's
[1:24:40] honest truth because most of the people
[1:24:42] are not going to be sincere enough
[1:24:45] to want to serve God
[1:24:52] is to open your big mouth before God
[1:24:57] not me
[1:25:00] you just opened it before God
[1:25:03] because you're telling him what you're
[1:25:05] going to do
[1:25:13] sorry
[1:25:17] I love you
[1:25:21] and love is correct even tells the truth
[1:25:24] and from the love of a heart of a man
[1:25:26] that spent 40 something years here
[1:25:29] trying to get you to see one thing
[1:25:32] this bride
[1:25:34] has got to destroy death
[1:25:41] there's not enough time to raise up
[1:25:42] another generation to do it in
[1:25:47] he said well you're telling God he can't
[1:25:48] do it no I'm telling that God ain't
[1:25:50] going to do it
[1:25:54] see death is taking you and I because
[1:25:56] death is unbelief we'll get down to that
[1:25:59] there's only one thing of death that's
[1:26:01] unbelief
[1:26:04] yeah but I believe everything
[1:26:07] forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[1:26:08] together as a manner of
[1:26:11] may I paraphrase that
[1:26:13] as a matter of unbelievers
[1:26:16] you say that's not what that said
[1:26:20] well
[1:26:22] I could probably remember when you told
[1:26:24] me that's what that said
[1:26:28] I know it I got too good of a memory I'm
[1:26:31] sorry
[1:26:32] Alzheimer's ain't hit me yet Old-Timers
[1:26:34] has but Alzheimer's name
[1:26:36] I can still remember
[1:26:38] the day when a lot of you were on fire
[1:26:47] but your fire is dwindling down
[1:26:54] your Fire's dwindling
[1:26:58] it's time to rekindle it
[1:27:02] sorry
[1:27:04] you go home call each other and talk all
[1:27:05] night long about how bad there for the
[1:27:07] daily is help yourself
[1:27:11] but when it's all finished and you start
[1:27:13] to hang up I hope one of you remembers
[1:27:16] to say
[1:27:17] did he tell the truth
[1:27:21] if you don't call me and I'll tell you
[1:27:24] I'll get to telephone companies call you
[1:27:26] and remind you that it's the truth
[1:27:30] you see the death that you and I facing
[1:27:32] the worst one of all is the unbelief
[1:27:38] Eve
[1:27:40] didn't believe God would keep his word
[1:27:45] what about now
[1:27:47] come on brothers think about it
[1:27:50] what about it
[1:27:53] we've got a
[1:27:55] need some prayer claws
[1:27:57] so we'll go ahead and everybody can
[1:27:59] stand and then we'll
[1:28:01] remind me to do it we could
[1:28:03] Brothers come up we'll pray over this
[1:28:06] and we need some more prayer claws put
[1:28:08] in the in the fight
[1:28:12] think on these things
[1:28:16] we might not see everything but we see
[1:28:18] Jesus
[1:28:22] the mighty conqueror
[1:28:26] but you know what
[1:28:28] he's got to come here
[1:28:31] and you and I
[1:28:32] to be able to take us there now how many
[1:28:34] times have you heard that statement
[1:28:43] how many times
[1:28:46] father
[1:28:50] I just thank you for tonight and I pray
[1:28:52] that what I've said is went into the
[1:28:54] hearts of each and every individual here
[1:28:56] including myself
[1:28:58] to realize
[1:29:00] that we see Jesus
[1:29:02] we see death destroyed by you Lord
[1:29:05] we see we see it still taking us because
[1:29:07] of our unbelief
[1:29:09] because of not believing that you've
[1:29:11] conquered everything
[1:29:12] oh yeah we believe it by words
[1:29:16] we believe it by forms of
[1:29:19] beliefs
[1:29:21] but we do we believe it by reality
[1:29:26] I believe all of our hearts would be
[1:29:28] changed in a different way
[1:29:29] thank you
[1:29:30] if we come to a reality
[1:29:34] and father maybe it's going to take that
[1:29:36] because you said through your Prophet
[1:29:37] that the bride does better under
[1:29:39] persecution well if that's what it takes
[1:29:41] Lord
[1:29:43] because see we're not afraid of dying
[1:29:46] I'm more afraid of living than I am
[1:29:48] dying Lord
[1:29:52] because in the living we get up and do a
[1:29:54] lot of mistakes and problems
[1:29:58] but if we just die out to ourselves you
[1:30:00] can take over
[1:30:02] we love you and we thank you
[1:30:04] just bless each one now you said in your
[1:30:06] word
[1:30:08] that you sent your word and healed us
[1:30:11] and delivered us from our destructions
[1:30:13] so we thank you for it
[1:30:16] thank you for healing us thank you for
[1:30:18] delivering us thank you for delivering
[1:30:20] everybody in the building from any
[1:30:21] sicknesses whatsoever
[1:30:23] is there
[1:30:24] we believe you
[1:30:26] and we thank you because we know that
[1:30:28] much of death is destroyed
[1:30:32] and it's so powerful until it'll conquer
[1:30:34] these human beings that we are
[1:30:38] we love you in Jesus name
[1:30:40] what do we got brother
[1:30:42] 174 in a red boat
[1:30:47] anybody have a knee the Alders
[1:31:09] now let us have a little talk with Jesus
[1:31:21] God we believe you and we thank you for
[1:31:25] it in Jesus name
[1:31:32] sometimes my path see we've seen a dead
[1:31:34] race
[1:31:41] we've seen Satan lose
[1:32:05] to reach down and touch
[1:32:08] and take away this pain we condemned
[1:32:11] that pain in the name of Jesus Christ on
[1:32:15] the basis of your words
[1:32:33] waiting on somebody to see that
[1:32:38] Jesus delivered
[1:32:45] and surviving by now when you feel a
[1:32:48] little prayer will turn
[1:32:50] no a little fire is
[1:32:58] thank you
[1:32:59] think about it just a little talk with
[1:33:02] Jesus
[1:33:04] Troublesome times are here filling men's
[1:33:08] hearts with fear Freedom we all hold
[1:33:12] dear now's that stage humble your heart
[1:33:17] to God Saves them a chasting rod seek
[1:33:21] the way pilgrims Christians away we
[1:33:26] won't even Jesus coming soon
[1:33:55] we thank you
[1:34:06] very fast
[1:34:35] my leg's been hurting me
[1:34:38] we go to doctors and we take things and
[1:34:41] do
[1:34:43] he's a real good friend of ours we talk
[1:34:45] about the Lord
[1:34:47] we've had some great conversations I've
[1:34:50] explained to him a little about brother
[1:34:51] Branham
[1:34:52] what we believe he talks to my wife all
[1:34:55] the time
[1:34:56] he's the one you know that
[1:34:59] put the prayer cloth up over his door
[1:35:01] because their business was kind of going
[1:35:02] down
[1:35:03] well that's kind of an odd way to pray
[1:35:05] but we prayed here and we took a prayer
[1:35:08] claw to put it over his door
[1:35:10] and you know their business went
[1:35:12] skyrocketed High
[1:35:14] well how God works things out that's
[1:35:17] none of our business maybe he sent them
[1:35:20] from other doctors around you know it's
[1:35:21] up to him
[1:35:23] but I went in the other day and
[1:35:26] we got to talking just a little bit
[1:35:30] he said I'm going to teach a class on
[1:35:32] family
[1:35:34] you know
[1:35:35] life and things
[1:35:37] and said you know what I'm going to take
[1:35:39] it from there in the scripture
[1:35:42] and said you know they're in Malachi 4.
[1:35:47] said where it says it and we're going to
[1:35:50] turn the hearts or the fathers to the
[1:35:52] children
[1:35:54] he said he'd turn the hearts to the
[1:35:56] children to the fathers and uh he said I
[1:36:01] want to talk to the children and I won't
[1:36:03] talk to the fathers and I want them to
[1:36:05] see that we can help each other you know
[1:36:07] well I didn't scream out loud you're
[1:36:11] wrong
[1:36:14] simply called he knew the scripture
[1:36:15] because he's quoting it to me he said
[1:36:17] there John
[1:36:19] did he come in the spirit of Elijah and
[1:36:22] said he uh in Luke 1 said he said he
[1:36:27] turned the hearts to the fathers to the
[1:36:29] children was either her and opened it up
[1:36:31] you know
[1:36:33] message
[1:36:35] have you ever considered what that's
[1:36:38] meaning
[1:36:41] I said John turn the hearts of the Old
[1:36:44] Testament Saints
[1:36:45] to the New Testament message of Jesus
[1:36:48] Christ he pointed to Calvary pointed to
[1:36:50] Christ he turned the people you know the
[1:36:53] hearts
[1:36:54] but I said
[1:36:57] then the Lord Jesus I said when he come
[1:36:59] they're in Luke because he done quoted
[1:37:01] that where Jesus you know read only part
[1:37:03] of the scripture
[1:37:05] and I said because the other part was
[1:37:07] pertaining to his second coming
[1:37:09] so he wasn't fulfilling that part and he
[1:37:12] said yeah
[1:37:13] I said well then what's going to happen
[1:37:15] to turn them children
[1:37:17] if he turned the hearts of the fathers
[1:37:22] to Salvation
[1:37:24] I said could John turn him because it
[1:37:26] said there in John Luke you know said
[1:37:28] and it goes right on he turned the
[1:37:30] hearts of the children and in terms of
[1:37:32] the Disobedience to this and they've
[1:37:34] been taught that he turned them this way
[1:37:36] and then he turned them right back you
[1:37:39] know
[1:37:39] and I said no I said if he turned them
[1:37:42] to the New Testament message
[1:37:44] and then he turned them back like it's
[1:37:46] taught by mankind I said let me turn
[1:37:48] them back under the law
[1:37:52] that's right
[1:37:54] I said well then uh
[1:37:56] something's got to happen to turn those
[1:37:57] hearts of the
[1:38:00] children
[1:38:02] back to the original faith
[1:38:06] of the Apostles
[1:38:09] he said
[1:38:12] that gives me something to think about
[1:38:15] he said I never thought about that
[1:38:18] you know what I didn't go on that length
[1:38:20] with him
[1:38:21] I walked out of the office
[1:38:24] shook his hand
[1:38:27] went on home
[1:38:29] well I don't mean it's wrong because it
[1:38:31] ain't right
[1:38:35] but you know what if my back hadn't been
[1:38:37] hurting
[1:38:38] and my leg I wouldn't have been there
[1:38:41] and I would have never got to talk to
[1:38:43] him about that
[1:38:46] I walked out of the parking lot I said
[1:38:49] Thank You Jesus
[1:38:51] thank you for my leg hurting me
[1:38:55] because I was able to witness
[1:38:58] to someone about your truth
[1:39:03] what do you think I worry about
[1:39:05] it hurting me
[1:39:13] but you know what
[1:39:15] I believe it's going to be gone
[1:39:20] so I don't worry about it
[1:39:23] see that's why we get afraid
[1:39:25] the doctor says I've got so and so
[1:39:31] well
[1:39:33] you got it
[1:39:35] as long as you believe you got it
[1:39:39] but when you turn around and say well
[1:39:41] doc you're right I got every symptom I
[1:39:44] got everything but my stripes I'm Healed
[1:39:53] I believe God does things in mysterious
[1:39:55] ways
[1:39:57] his wonders to perform
[1:40:00] you might be sick sometimes to try to
[1:40:03] for somebody else
[1:40:06] well
[1:40:07] well brother Dale did you say you wasn't
[1:40:08] going to pray for me no no no no no I
[1:40:12] said Lord now that's been done I said
[1:40:14] Lord you took care of it I got a witness
[1:40:17] now help us lag
[1:40:24] let's see death is not my conqueror
[1:40:28] he's my victory that I'll be in the
[1:40:30] presence of God in a Split Second
[1:40:35] yeah but I'm afraid of dying
[1:40:37] the owners open
[1:40:42] you need to be praying if you're afraid
[1:40:44] of dying
[1:40:45] because all you're wanting to do is
[1:40:47] escape hell
[1:40:54] did you really know and understand
[1:40:58] where the brothers comes we're going to
[1:41:00] pray over these
[1:41:03] prayer cloth
[1:41:05] come on
[1:41:10] brother brother collie brother the
[1:41:13] volunteerence
[1:41:14] Aaron
[1:41:15] I don't know
[1:41:18] because see we believe in this
[1:41:22] we believe in
[1:41:24] sending out practical laws
[1:41:26] we can stand here and give witness to
[1:41:28] whatever to the things that's happened
[1:41:30] over the times of us with little old
[1:41:33] prayer clause
[1:41:34] I liked it one time and I still got one
[1:41:37] in my billfold that we took the top off
[1:41:39] of this Pulpit this this material and we
[1:41:43] cut it up and give it away well I like
[1:41:44] that because there's been a lot of
[1:41:46] things to people out there has never
[1:41:48] been up here you're to walk up here and
[1:41:50] look sometime there's a row of kids and
[1:41:52] people and parents and adults and and
[1:41:55] everything all around here
[1:41:57] and when we're preaching you think I
[1:41:59] ain't looking at them sometimes and
[1:42:03] we even start going down the side over
[1:42:05] here
[1:42:08] we'll probably take this up again one
[1:42:10] day and give it away too
[1:42:12] but we pray
[1:42:14] so let's just pray
[1:42:17] put it right here and all of the
[1:42:19] brothers we'll all gather together
[1:42:21] if you want to put it on your fingers
[1:42:23] and do
[1:42:24] then we will all pray over this and then
[1:42:27] we'll cut it up
[1:42:28] this is the from handkerchief that was
[1:42:31] left over from the youth banquet in
[1:42:34] Alabama in 2006 and so we you know
[1:42:39] we use them for that
[1:42:41] to make prayer claws out of
[1:42:43] it you know and I believe it don't you
[1:42:46] we were like Brother Richard Wilson was
[1:42:49] telling that time that they gave that
[1:42:50] lady in prison
[1:42:51] a prayer cloth and
[1:42:53] she sleep every night this other lady
[1:42:55] and I couldn't sleep she talked her into
[1:42:57] letting her borrow it for one night she
[1:42:59] borrowed it and the lady that borrowed
[1:43:00] the prayer clock went to sleep and the
[1:43:02] lady that didn't have the prayer cloth
[1:43:03] stayed awake all night
[1:43:05] so we can give a lot of testimonies
[1:43:07] about these prayer claws so let's just
[1:43:09] pray over them all right
[1:43:11] father in the name of our Lord and
[1:43:15] Savior Jesus Christ
[1:43:16] we know the truth of what it is it was
[1:43:19] to be aprons taken
[1:43:21] Norton
[1:43:23] but yet we're not just taking an apron
[1:43:25] and piece of material off of our clothes
[1:43:27] or something that would be good Lord
[1:43:29] but yet we've warned this there are two
[1:43:32] Services now here laying on the platform
[1:43:34] and warning
[1:43:36] that we believe you Lord
[1:43:37] we believe that you'll anoint this with
[1:43:40] your anointing presence
[1:43:42] and that father you will be the one that
[1:43:45] will make it manifest

[1:44:01] amen and amen and amen amen we believe
[1:44:06] it

[1:44:09] and we even let and I'm going to
[1:44:11] probably let them do it again we we even
[1:44:13] let the kids cut up the prayer clause
[1:44:17] you know let them have a part to do with
[1:44:19] it maybe next time we're going to make
[1:44:21] them a little bigger because they cut me
[1:44:22] up a bunch one time that's too small
