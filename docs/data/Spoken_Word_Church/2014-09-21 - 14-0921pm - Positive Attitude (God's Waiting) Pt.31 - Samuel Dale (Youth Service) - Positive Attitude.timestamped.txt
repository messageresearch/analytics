[28:58] amen and amen i believe we've seen him
[29:01] in the children don't you
[29:03] amen let's give them a good hand
[29:09] basically that part about jonas it's
[29:11] saying
[29:12] god is strong
[29:16] some of you in the back might not have
[29:17] been able to see him but he had that arm
[29:19] up
[29:20] he was strong so
[29:22] he believed it amen
[29:25] but we appreciate the kids appreciate
[29:27] you doing
[29:28] you know
[29:32] if you like turning your scriptures
[29:33] turned in
[29:34] genesis 3.
[29:36] we finally get now the book of hebrews
[29:39] not out of the thought but out of the
[29:40] book of hebrews
[29:42] we're going to genesis i mean excuse me
[29:45] uh exodus
[29:47] i'm getting in bad shape
[29:50] i got so much in genesis
[29:51] wrote down
[29:54] i got four three three things in genesis
[29:56] wrote down but we want to go to exodus
[29:59] but you know we have announcements now
[30:01] remember the lord willing brother gibby
[30:02] be preaching verse is coming wednesday
[30:05] uh brother reid will be here with us for
[30:07] the weekend
[30:08] ministering
[30:10] uh
[30:11] on this coming
[30:12] weekend sunday and then the lord willing
[30:15] on october the 1st which will be the
[30:17] next wednesday
[30:19] we're going to get brother luis
[30:21] into the ranks
[30:23] and let him be in preaching he said he
[30:24] didn't know anything about it i said you
[30:26] don't know nothing about it
[30:30] you know how to do with it
[30:32] we just tell him what to do
[30:35] just kidding
[30:36] uh then then the lord willing brother
[30:38] forney will be with us on the 25th
[30:41] and brother ernie villanueva will be
[30:43] with us on the second day of november so
[30:45] that's getting these brothers announced
[30:48] and getting that part out of the way but
[30:50] we appreciate these brothers and
[30:52] appreciate the ministry
[30:54] the lord has
[30:55] allowed us to be able to hear
[30:57] because i truly believe faith comes by
[30:59] hearing
[31:00] i've never said faith comes by preaching
[31:03] it doesn't say that it says faith comes
[31:05] by hearing now somebody's got to preach
[31:07] but that's a different point right so
[31:09] we'll do that okay exodus 3
[31:12] we'll get into a little talk this
[31:13] afternoon
[31:14] father we thank you for your loving your
[31:16] grace and unto us and we thank you for
[31:18] all things and we pray that you would
[31:19] bless us and
[31:21] understanding because that's our desires
[31:23] and lord that you would truly come and
[31:25] open the eyes of our hearts
[31:27] that we may see you and want to walk
[31:29] into your loving grace father these old
[31:31] bodies we know are
[31:33] deteriorating away because of the age
[31:35] factor that's dwelling upon all of us
[31:38] but we know and surely know for truth
[31:40] that as the end time is coming upon us
[31:43] then we look up for our redemption draw
[31:45] at night
[31:46] lord we love you and we thank you and we
[31:49] commit everything to you now you come
[31:50] and speak to our hearts
[31:52] thank you for the children and they're
[31:54] dedicated of their lives to get up and
[31:56] sing and
[31:57] worship and all lord and to praise you
[32:00] we pray that you would accept that
[32:03] from the hearts of these little kids out
[32:05] of love for you lord we love you and we
[32:07] thank you in jesus name amen
[32:11] odd scripture maybe to start off with
[32:13] but we
[32:16] generally have odd ways right
[32:19] exodus 3
[32:22] now moses kept the flock of jethro his
[32:24] father-in-law the priest of midian
[32:26] and he led the flock to the backside of
[32:28] the desert and came to the mount of god
[32:32] even to horeb and the angel of the lord
[32:33] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[32:35] of the midst of a bush
[32:37] and he looked and behold a bush burned
[32:39] with fire and the bush was not consumed
[32:41] and moses said now i want you to watch
[32:45] between moses and god
[32:48] in in relationship
[32:50] i want you to watch that little word i
[32:54] because it means a personal
[32:57] contact
[32:59] the
[33:00] so watch it moses it says about him i
[33:03] even said about god and it's a it's a
[33:05] personal con now what have we been
[33:07] saying that everybody in the bible ever
[33:08] mounted anything had a personal
[33:11] experience
[33:12] with god
[33:13] and so that's what we need right and
[33:15] moses said i will now turn aside and see
[33:18] this great sight
[33:19] while the bush is not burned
[33:21] and when the lord saw that he turned
[33:22] aside to see now
[33:25] you know
[33:26] you think lord didn't know he was going
[33:28] to do it but
[33:29] you know he was waiting on him all right
[33:32] long time we'll get to it in a minute
[33:35] and the lord saw that he turned aside to
[33:37] see god called unto him out of the midst
[33:40] of the bush and said moses moses
[33:42] and he said
[33:44] here am i
[33:45] and he said draw
[33:46] not nigh hither
[33:48] put off thy shoes from thy feet for the
[33:50] place we're in thou standeth is holy
[33:52] ground
[33:53] moreover he said
[33:56] i am
[33:57] the lord of thy father and the god of
[34:00] abraham the god of isaac and the god of
[34:02] jacob and moses hid his face for he was
[34:04] afraid to look upon god
[34:06] and the lord said i have surely seen the
[34:09] afflictions of my people
[34:11] which are in egypt and have
[34:14] heard their cry for a reason of their
[34:15] taskmasters for i know their sorrows and
[34:20] i am come down to deliver thee out of
[34:22] the hand delivered them out of the hand
[34:25] of the egyptians and to bring them
[34:28] up out of that land into a good land and
[34:31] a large unto a land flowing with milk
[34:33] and honey
[34:34] under the place of the canaanites the
[34:36] hittites the amorites
[34:38] purge the sites the highways the
[34:39] jebusites
[34:41] now therefore behold the cry of the
[34:43] children of israel is coming to me
[34:47] and i have also seen the oppression
[34:50] we're with the egyptians oppressed them
[34:53] come now therefore and i will send thee
[34:56] unto pharaoh
[34:57] that thou must bring forth my people
[35:00] the children of israel
[35:02] out of egypt you may be seated the lord
[35:04] had his blessing to the reading of the
[35:06] word
[35:07] and i said i want you to notice the
[35:09] personal things that
[35:11] you know
[35:15] you know it's been said and it's a good
[35:18] point
[35:19] that when he went down to
[35:21] at this point you're going down to verse
[35:23] 12 or 13 14 there it talks about i am
[35:27] that i am
[35:28] when they went down moses went down to
[35:30] egypt and over pharaoh said who's going
[35:32] to take him out he said i am
[35:34] i got pretty personal
[35:35] you know because that was
[35:37] the way that i want you to think about
[35:39] it
[35:40] i want you to think about
[35:42] you know still keeping the positive
[35:44] attitude
[35:45] and that a personal contact
[35:48] with almighty god
[35:50] to where that
[35:52] you know
[35:53] uh
[35:54] you can realize that
[35:56] uh somebody else is in command it's not
[35:59] you
[36:00] because that's the first thing we should
[36:02] recognize
[36:03] is it's not us
[36:05] but
[36:05] you know it's what he's doing
[36:08] and he's the one that's promised it and
[36:12] uh just a little background material of
[36:15] it
[36:16] uh
[36:17] you know
[36:18] it was told to
[36:20] abraham
[36:21] over in genesis 15
[36:24] in the uh commissioning and the sending
[36:26] forth of abraham and the time as he was
[36:29] going through the visions and the
[36:31] different things
[36:32] it was told him that the children of
[36:34] israel would be
[36:35] down in egypt for 400 years
[36:38] now remember one thing you've got to
[36:42] have
[36:43] either you're talking about two things
[36:44] or either to me i believe it's just the
[36:46] one
[36:47] but
[36:48] uh
[36:50] the children of israel were never sent
[36:52] to egypt
[36:54] as captivity
[36:57] they became in bondage
[36:59] after they were in egypt they were
[37:01] actually sent dire in a way to be
[37:04] conquerors you know
[37:06] because you know the pharaoh just gave
[37:08] them everything and you take the best
[37:11] you know and all of that but then
[37:13] they rose up one that didn't know joseph
[37:16] well then from that time on
[37:19] then the children of israel begin to be
[37:21] afflicted
[37:23] so it's not really a record i'm not
[37:25] trying to do nothing but just make a
[37:26] point
[37:28] that
[37:30] it's not that they were sent to egypt as
[37:32] slaves
[37:33] they went down there themselves
[37:36] but yet when they got down there
[37:38] now
[37:40] i hope you follow my point
[37:42] when they got down there
[37:45] maybe they become too much egyptian
[37:48] you know
[37:49] because they kind of lost their
[37:53] um personality
[37:55] uh whatever you want to call it
[37:58] and we say well there was a
[38:01] you know one raised up that didn't know
[38:03] joseph well that's fine because that was
[38:05] part of the doings
[38:06] but my point of what i'm saying is that
[38:09] had they not become so settled down in
[38:12] where they were
[38:14] and things happening
[38:15] that when they first started being
[38:17] persecuted they could have probably rose
[38:19] up and whipped the egyptians
[38:21] you know because that was the problem
[38:23] the egyptians had they were afraid of
[38:25] them
[38:26] well you know there was no there was no
[38:28] bondage thing that they were under
[38:31] then they slowly gradually began to put
[38:34] them under bondage
[38:35] to
[38:36] uh you know
[38:38] to this new pharaoh that didn't know
[38:39] joseph
[38:40] well to me it's kind of like us
[38:43] sometimes
[38:44] that you know remember a lot it vexed
[38:47] his righteous soul the things that went
[38:49] on in sodom
[38:51] but yet he was sitting in the door and
[38:52] wouldn't do anything about it
[38:54] he kind of sat there and just kind of
[38:56] let it go
[38:57] you know and maybe that's the way we do
[38:59] and my point is that the reason
[39:02] now god had already in the
[39:06] calling of abraham
[39:08] had already told him
[39:11] that
[39:12] in genesis that
[39:15] they would be down there 400 years
[39:17] all right
[39:18] and see then that was looking forward to
[39:20] knowing that something's going to take
[39:22] place
[39:23] well what took place was that they got
[39:25] out of contact with god
[39:28] because if they'd have seen what was
[39:30] going on
[39:32] you know and why didn't they
[39:34] just jump up right then and say wait a
[39:36] minute
[39:38] you know because they were really a
[39:39] powerful nation
[39:42] the pharaoh got tired or i mean got
[39:44] obscured over him so he he began to put
[39:47] taskmasters over them
[39:49] but they still just kind of went along
[39:51] with it
[39:52] they went into slavery
[39:56] are you following me
[39:58] they went into slavery
[40:01] a lot on their own
[40:04] well don't you think that's the way
[40:05] mankind has always been
[40:10] that
[40:11] instead of god making us go into slavery
[40:14] see we think that they come over here
[40:16] and our ideas was they come over here
[40:17] and they've done something wrong in this
[40:18] drove down here well they was that away
[40:20] a lot of times
[40:22] and that was true a lot of times that
[40:23] they went through those things but this
[40:25] time is not that way
[40:28] this time they be gradually were brought
[40:31] into slavery
[40:33] all right and being brought into slavery
[40:35] then
[40:36] it was so easily going along until
[40:39] until things had to start really
[40:41] happening
[40:42] and even after it started happening
[40:45] they still didn't fight back against it
[40:48] you know they kind of
[40:50] just relaxed and
[40:52] you know even after they get over into
[40:54] the wilderness i never did understand
[40:56] that one but
[40:57] they said oh if we just stayed down
[40:59] there where we had the garlics and the
[41:00] cucumbers
[41:02] now
[41:06] you know garlic is okay as long as you
[41:08] stay away from me when you eat it
[41:11] and cucumbers is only one good thing
[41:13] about them they make you burp
[41:15] so then i i just don't see any great
[41:17] value of wanting to go back to garlics
[41:20] and cucumbers you know i mean i'd rather
[41:22] eat the dirt off the ground but
[41:25] but my point is just to lay a little
[41:26] thought in your mind
[41:28] for what we want to say
[41:30] because see they
[41:33] had kind of got
[41:36] over there and got in and
[41:38] maybe you know i'm on their side
[41:41] maybe that's why they didn't understand
[41:45] because my point is of this way
[41:52] why didn't israel
[41:55] begin to go back into
[41:59] what they had of the word the scrolls of
[42:01] things
[42:03] and why didn't they
[42:05] figure out by the scrolls
[42:09] that they wouldn't go be down there no
[42:10] more than 400 years
[42:13] because god had done told abraham now
[42:14] remember there were there 430
[42:17] but you know the scripture said it'd be
[42:19] like 400 years all right but there were
[42:21] the 30 years because of the rejecting
[42:23] or even after moses came on the scene
[42:28] but why didn't they rally behind moses
[42:33] and why didn't some of them figure out
[42:35] like who was we talking about jeremiah
[42:37] one of them that said it'd be down there
[42:38] for 70 years and and daniel said we've
[42:40] been here 68
[42:42] years see
[42:43] he got in there he knew something was
[42:46] going to take place
[42:47] well my point is why didn't israel
[42:51] had they become so uh
[42:56] for lack of revelation or lack of
[42:58] understanding or
[43:00] or lack of
[43:01] knowing that god was on their side
[43:04] had they become to a point that they
[43:06] just
[43:07] didn't really know what's going on
[43:10] why didn't they read the scrolls check
[43:13] the time
[43:14] whatever you want to do they had ways
[43:16] they kept up with all the things
[43:18] and why didn't they
[43:20] say well we know
[43:22] we're going out here pretty quick
[43:24] we might not be able to set the date
[43:25] because
[43:26] of the bondage and the parts and the
[43:28] things but we were supposed to be here
[43:30] 400 years
[43:31] and then at about time we started
[43:33] getting out of here
[43:37] because i believe if they had have
[43:39] understood
[43:40] where they were at
[43:42] they would not have rejected moses
[43:46] right
[43:49] especially
[43:51] it's not in the writings but
[43:53] we know he did
[43:54] surely moses
[43:56] and those people remember was raised up
[43:58] with moses
[44:00] all right they knew the story of moses
[44:03] they knew the deliverance of
[44:05] somebody was supposed to come all right
[44:08] you know they knew there was going to be
[44:10] a strong hand because it said it over
[44:12] here in genesis
[44:14] you know there'd be a deliverance
[44:16] all right
[44:17] and
[44:18] why couldn't they get the picture
[44:20] together
[44:23] of what was going on
[44:27] and be able to kind of look in the
[44:29] scrolls in the word
[44:32] and i don't believe they would have
[44:33] rejected moses
[44:35] because they would have been after
[44:36] anything that would have been
[44:38] um
[44:40] try to bring a deliverance
[44:43] and we're rallied around him
[44:46] because naturally moses probably told
[44:49] him
[44:51] you know there when the first little
[44:52] incidents happened and the first thing
[44:54] going on moses would talk so don't you
[44:56] remember the story
[45:00] my mother told me
[45:01] i was to be a deliverer
[45:05] right
[45:08] surely you know some things went on
[45:11] to explain that he was to be the
[45:12] deliverer
[45:14] and they turned it down
[45:17] you know
[45:18] my point is to you and i
[45:24] do we want to deliver
[45:31] would we accept a deliverer
[45:37] i want to get out of here don't you
[45:40] ain't you kind of interested in getting
[45:41] out of this world i mean age is taking
[45:43] over
[45:43] the biggest portion of us and the ones
[45:45] that are younger you're getting older
[45:46] faster and we got
[45:48] older
[45:49] you know because you're wearing out
[45:50] quicker than we wore out
[45:54] but instead of repenting
[45:58] for anything that they would think
[46:02] and i'm trying to get that story behind
[46:04] it because for you to think about it
[46:08] it's not that the children of israel
[46:09] would be repenting
[46:11] because they was not really thinking
[46:13] about
[46:15] their sin
[46:17] it put them there because their sin did
[46:19] not put them there that's right
[46:22] right
[46:23] i mean they went there as victorious not
[46:25] as sin
[46:28] but see after a while
[46:30] their sin the problem with their sin the
[46:32] way i look at it was they become at ease
[46:35] in zion as the bible says
[46:38] or better to say ease in egypt you know
[46:43] they got
[46:44] settled down
[46:46] you know
[46:47] but see there was other things that god
[46:49] had told abraham
[46:51] and how they would go on and be a great
[46:53] nation a great people
[46:57] there was their unbelief that's what i'm
[46:59] trying to get to you first couple of
[47:00] messages
[47:02] is our biggest unbelief is to doubt what
[47:05] god has said and spoken of you and i
[47:13] not the great sin of
[47:16] of of drinking gambling smoking
[47:19] you know
[47:22] we went through two services trying to
[47:24] express that to you
[47:26] all right
[47:28] but our what is our greatest sin
[47:30] to not believe who we are
[47:34] do you think they would have wanted to
[47:36] stay in egypt if they could have
[47:38] realized who they were
[47:40] and
[47:41] realized that abraham had already
[47:44] prophesied spoke that god had showed him
[47:47] that they would go to a land
[47:51] that would be flowing with milk and
[47:52] honey
[47:54] read your bible and just sit down and
[47:56] think about it and think about it then
[47:58] in relation to you and i
[48:02] you know our time no that's what we're
[48:04] supposed to do
[48:05] so they wasn't slaves
[48:08] but they became slaves
[48:12] because they would not raise up and take
[48:14] their position
[48:16] all right
[48:17] now see you and i can easily become
[48:20] slaves to ladies
[48:22] easy to do
[48:24] all right because of the age and the
[48:26] time and the relationship and everything
[48:28] you know
[48:29] to worry that
[48:31] you know what's going on today
[48:35] and instead of
[48:36] looking into we say this in our wesley
[48:39] instead of them looking into the word
[48:42] to see
[48:44] how long they was to be there
[48:47] because they would be able to calculate
[48:49] a little bit
[48:51] and to look in there and to see if there
[48:53] was anything wrong
[48:56] you know
[48:57] try to find their sin
[49:00] because surely for 400 years wherever
[49:04] how many years it was there at the
[49:05] bondage
[49:07] they would think about
[49:09] well why is god putting this on us
[49:15] now
[49:16] according to the prophet
[49:19] that's why i said i got the thought and
[49:22] i ain't even got any
[49:23] notes or nothing but
[49:25] according to the prophet of god in this
[49:27] last days
[49:30] the children of israel in this last days
[49:32] was forced back to the homeland right
[49:36] i mean they were literally forced back
[49:38] persecution of people under eichmann and
[49:40] hitler mussolini
[49:43] and those people
[49:44] force the jews to want to go home
[49:48] all right
[49:50] look like they're in
[49:52] they're doing that
[49:54] you know they would have said hey
[49:56] back then see
[49:58] we're the children of god
[50:01] we're not supposed to be in bondage
[50:04] you know
[50:06] let's raise up and get out of here
[50:11] but instead of checking out to see
[50:13] the problem
[50:16] you know
[50:17] and why they were there
[50:20] and how long they were going to be
[50:24] there they just
[50:27] relaxed a little more
[50:31] because when moses said i mean surely
[50:34] come on think sensibly moses didn't walk
[50:36] out there and just kill that egyptian
[50:38] and say um i will take over they said
[50:42] okay take over the army you're in charge
[50:45] right because he was
[50:47] right
[50:49] he was capable of taking an insurrection
[50:52] against the government and had all the
[50:54] military behind him
[50:57] all right
[50:58] but instead of doing that here he goes
[51:01] you get scared
[51:03] well
[51:07] then again they lose it
[51:10] one little ray of hope that that rose up
[51:13] as moses to explaining
[51:16] to them
[51:18] you know
[51:19] that he was to be the leader
[51:22] sparked a little ray of hope within
[51:24] their hearts and lives
[51:27] and as it did
[51:30] they maybe rallied around him for a
[51:31] while
[51:36] don't you think that's what happened in
[51:37] the last days
[51:40] when brother branham came on the scene
[51:41] and began to
[51:43] talk about these things
[51:46] and who the people were
[51:48] the people kind of rallied around that
[51:50] for a while
[51:53] right
[51:54] and they could have went with it
[51:59] but then once
[52:00] he was removed from the scene
[52:04] as moses was sent into the desert
[52:11] they lost what little bit of a rally
[52:12] they had
[52:16] you know
[52:19] now you see the people of the world and
[52:20] what is it
[52:22] even the people of the message
[52:25] is now
[52:26] trying to prove
[52:28] the message wrong the prophet wrong
[52:30] the things
[52:33] don't you see the same situation sitting
[52:38] that instead of israel
[52:40] thinking they were victorious and rose
[52:42] up
[52:43] with a little ray of hope through moses
[52:46] oh
[52:48] who do you think you are
[52:51] are you going to kill us
[52:53] like you killed that egyptian
[52:57] and you know we
[52:58] we look at movies and we see things that
[53:00] pharaoh rose up and
[53:02] and he drove moses out
[53:05] well you know you read your bible and
[53:06] you don't see that right
[53:12] so we're going to take the movie
[53:17] you know the director's way of thinking
[53:19] are we going to take the bible
[53:21] to me if you read it correctly
[53:25] sure pharaoh got riled up but you know
[53:28] what moses got scared
[53:32] he thought they would rally around him
[53:37] and to me now
[53:39] i don't see pharaoh as it's in the movie
[53:42] you know takes moses out and
[53:44] gives him one bottle of water and sends
[53:47] him into the desert
[53:48] because he didn't want to kill him
[53:50] because he was afraid
[53:52] of the military
[53:54] that moses was head of you know they
[53:56] make a beautiful picture
[53:58] the beautiful pictures are not always
[54:00] right
[54:02] to me it looks like moses got us scared
[54:04] and moses grabbed him
[54:06] half a gallon of water and he took off
[54:08] to the desert
[54:11] right
[54:12] when you read your bible
[54:14] all right
[54:16] but see instead of the people then
[54:18] seeing it
[54:20] they see their uh
[54:22] potential savior
[54:25] as
[54:26] leaving the scene
[54:29] all right
[54:32] instead of checking out their
[54:35] time
[54:38] that said they would be there
[54:40] instead of checking out their
[54:43] sin in their life of unbelief
[54:47] they just poured it more back on god and
[54:50] complained more to god
[54:54] right
[54:56] and then they complain to moses and
[54:58] moses when he comes back over to the
[55:00] liver they really got laid on them
[55:02] didn't they
[55:04] 40 years later and it really got laid on
[55:07] them
[55:08] all right
[55:12] but i hope you follow my point
[55:16] i think it's about time to realize that
[55:20] obamacare is not going to help us
[55:25] and oh hillary care is not going to help
[55:27] us if she becomes president
[55:30] or who becomes president is not going to
[55:31] help us
[55:33] we're a doomed bunch of people
[55:38] and are we going to just sit down
[55:40] haphazardly and
[55:43] well we just
[55:45] don't know where's anything going on now
[55:47] or not
[55:50] maybe something will happen one day
[55:52] somebody will raise up
[55:54] and that's what you see
[55:56] you see the young men that's come along
[55:58] in this message some of them or some
[56:00] people come along they grab a doctor and
[56:02] they run and everybody runs with it
[56:05] and after a while they just start
[56:06] dwindling away from it
[56:08] why because it's not producing
[56:14] but have we forgotten
[56:19] are we like israel
[56:23] that had forgotten
[56:25] that there was a deliverer to be sent
[56:30] a promise to abraham
[56:35] that his seed would go down there and
[56:36] journey and all these things but yet
[56:39] they would come out with a mighty hand
[56:44] after all that you and i have seen in
[56:46] this day
[56:49] god's sending a prophet to
[56:51] to show these things and being done
[56:56] and yet the people are
[56:58] just dying away
[57:02] oh they still flare up groups and you
[57:04] know where i stand i've told you where i
[57:06] stand there's flare-up groups that are
[57:09] brother randoms coming back
[57:11] this has got to happen that's got to
[57:13] happen
[57:14] okay
[57:16] all right
[57:22] but what's that got to do with you and i
[57:23] what are we dealing with
[57:26] what's your idea of what will bring a
[57:28] rapture to pass
[57:34] i mean you've got one
[57:36] you've got a brain
[57:38] you got some concept
[57:41] some thought
[57:42] and what is it
[57:48] but instead of checking our unbelief
[57:53] we just go further into unbelief
[57:58] well we don't see nothing going on
[58:02] oh yeah 40 years ago
[58:05] 50 something you know
[58:07] we saw great moves and we saw great
[58:09] things and
[58:13] but we've come down to a rapture
[58:18] and like i said when moses went back to
[58:20] egypt
[58:22] you think they wanted him as a deliverer
[58:26] you better read your bible
[58:28] they said moses since you got back here
[58:32] we have doubled our own works
[58:34] we are now having to go out and get her
[58:36] own straw you have laid labor up on top
[58:40] of labor you have brought
[58:42] shame upon us
[58:45] at least we could deal with the
[58:47] egyptians
[58:48] we had a few garlics and cucumbers
[58:53] but now you want us to go out into the
[58:55] wilderness
[59:00] it took god to come on the scene to
[59:03] totally
[59:05] well what is the bible says about it
[59:07] said i'm my raised raised r-a-g-e-d
[59:11] is what i said i think raised egypt
[59:13] which means every how you spell it it it
[59:16] means they literally moses literally by
[59:18] his word wiped egypt out
[59:22] raised
[59:25] he literally wiped egypt out by his word
[59:29] and you think that was ready to go
[59:34] probably the biggest force in them
[59:35] wanted to get out of there because they
[59:36] was afraid of what not what the next
[59:38] plague would be
[59:43] then they get out just a little while
[59:47] and they start murmuring and complaining
[59:55] israel was told
[59:57] what would take place
[1:00:00] but they didn't believe it
[1:00:03] brother adam has told us
[1:00:05] what will happen here in the end time
[1:00:09] and how it will be
[1:00:15] but are we checking up ourselves and
[1:00:20] not necessarily calculating time but
[1:00:23] you know time is a factor
[1:00:28] but checking up to see
[1:00:30] if there's any
[1:00:33] sin
[1:00:36] that's causing us to be here
[1:00:47] i believe israel finally
[1:00:51] maybe begin to realize a little bit
[1:00:53] about their mistakes and
[1:00:55] you get on over about joshua
[1:00:57] and they begin to go into the land
[1:01:01] and you know by then probably some of
[1:01:02] them begin to realize that
[1:01:08] they were the problem
[1:01:13] we want to blame everybody else don't we
[1:01:17] we want a
[1:01:19] woman in the white house
[1:01:23] we want a russia coming after oil we
[1:01:24] want to
[1:01:26] pope out of the united states
[1:01:32] instead of thinking about
[1:01:36] us
[1:01:41] you know what's wrong with little church
[1:01:44] me
[1:01:53] but you know what if i sitting out there
[1:01:54] in the pew i'd say you know what's wrong
[1:01:56] with lula church
[1:01:59] me
[1:02:02] we all should think about
[1:02:06] we're the problem
[1:02:10] is it my unbelief yeah but i don't have
[1:02:13] any i believe everything the prophet
[1:02:14] said like i said i bring out some things
[1:02:17] a lot of times
[1:02:18] that i hope shows you
[1:02:20] you don't fully have an understanding
[1:02:26] of
[1:02:27] what's going on
[1:02:29] and you know why i do that
[1:02:31] dory you wake up
[1:02:34] and get away from we're in the message
[1:02:38] when i preached two services
[1:02:41] brother gary came out
[1:02:42] the other day and he said brother dale
[1:02:44] he said you preached on this a long time
[1:02:48] it said you finally
[1:02:50] brought it to a level or a thoughts
[1:02:53] of understanding
[1:02:55] of what sin is
[1:03:01] and how that the greatest sin of all is
[1:03:04] the unbelief of you and i
[1:03:07] the reason we're here today
[1:03:12] is because of you and now
[1:03:15] all right now here we get into the
[1:03:17] thought
[1:03:22] look what brother random says about the
[1:03:24] children of israel
[1:03:28] from spoken words original seed go at
[1:03:30] number one
[1:03:34] and he's talking about moses and the
[1:03:36] time
[1:03:38] that's more original seed paragraph 4
[1:03:40] 24.
[1:03:42] moses never stayed in egypt and argued
[1:03:44] his scriptural points with them
[1:03:47] he never flushed with the priest
[1:03:49] but he went to the wilderness and waited
[1:03:51] on the lord
[1:03:55] until the until the people were ready to
[1:03:58] receive him
[1:04:03] now i've laid it down to a point
[1:04:05] deliberately
[1:04:06] that when he came back the people wasn't
[1:04:09] thinking
[1:04:10] like brother branham is saying that they
[1:04:12] were ready
[1:04:13] but we'll get to that in a second
[1:04:15] what it was
[1:04:16] they did at least by then
[1:04:19] begin to cry out for a deliverer
[1:04:23] right
[1:04:25] now
[1:04:27] he had come to testify
[1:04:29] of them
[1:04:30] but they would not receive him
[1:04:32] god called his prophet to the wilderness
[1:04:35] god had testified he had
[1:04:37] chosen him
[1:04:40] but the waiting was not by moses
[1:04:44] but for the people to get ready
[1:04:47] to receive moses
[1:04:51] moses thought the children would
[1:04:53] understand that he was sent
[1:04:56] he said i never wrote that
[1:05:00] so now we get down to the thought
[1:05:06] finally after israel is going through so
[1:05:08] much trouble
[1:05:11] and seeing that
[1:05:14] moses as i said sparked a little ray of
[1:05:16] light
[1:05:18] in them
[1:05:19] but then he went out in the desert was
[1:05:22] gone
[1:05:25] the taskmasters got worse and worse
[1:05:29] and the children of israel began to cry
[1:05:31] for a deliverer
[1:05:36] they might not have first believed it
[1:05:38] that's the whole
[1:05:39] layout to what i brought
[1:05:42] they did rally enough to get up and
[1:05:44] leave with him
[1:05:50] you might not have understood that's
[1:05:52] okay
[1:05:54] god don't bother about that that don't
[1:05:56] worry him or you and i not to understand
[1:06:02] but get up move
[1:06:07] so what does he do
[1:06:11] they begin to cry for a deliverer
[1:06:16] probably might have been a bunch of old
[1:06:17] hard heads among them like brother dale
[1:06:19] is again
[1:06:21] and to begin to tell them they're wrong
[1:06:24] and the reason they was dire
[1:06:27] in you know
[1:06:29] you
[1:06:30] know but look at the next one which is
[1:06:34] faith is a substance
[1:06:40] by and by they're raised up
[1:06:42] or a pharaoh who did not know joseph
[1:06:44] and then the people got in bondage
[1:06:48] and they had to make straw houses and
[1:06:51] bricks and things out of straw
[1:06:53] and stuff
[1:06:55] and when they began to cry to guard for
[1:06:57] a deliverer
[1:06:58] is that right and they cried
[1:07:01] and cried
[1:07:03] and god foreordained to deliver her
[1:07:07] is that right
[1:07:11] but i still want you to think
[1:07:16] why
[1:07:17] did they not read the word
[1:07:24] to find how long they would be
[1:07:34] surely somebody's own record was made by
[1:07:36] then
[1:07:38] i know where moses comes in the writings
[1:07:40] and all that okay i know he wrote the
[1:07:43] books
[1:07:44] but by then a lot of people remembered
[1:07:47] some things and some promises
[1:07:49] abraham
[1:07:52] why didn't they rally around
[1:07:54] that no
[1:07:57] so they begin to cry out to god for a
[1:08:00] deliverer
[1:08:01] right
[1:08:02] and you know god sent moses right back
[1:08:09] to the people
[1:08:13] but remember they had to be crying out
[1:08:17] israel had to be calling out to god
[1:08:22] before he sent to deliver
[1:08:27] but now the difference in them and us
[1:08:32] is as we'd say maybe they had scrolls
[1:08:34] maybe they had a few things
[1:08:36] from a lot his memory was handed down
[1:08:38] you know one to the other because they
[1:08:40] had people back then that kept up with
[1:08:42] things you know and you go to some of
[1:08:44] these countries now and there's people
[1:08:45] that'll sit down there with you and they
[1:08:47] can tell you every who's who's who's
[1:08:49] who's ken and what's what because it by
[1:08:51] memory they
[1:08:52] take it down all right
[1:08:55] and they could remember a lot of things
[1:09:00] but they never begin to think about
[1:09:02] their own selves
[1:09:08] they never begin to think about their
[1:09:10] own unbelief
[1:09:14] and if i'd have been moses i'd have
[1:09:15] walked right in i'd have got them all
[1:09:17] together and i said boys you didn't
[1:09:20] believe me the first time
[1:09:25] are you going to believe me now
[1:09:31] that's probably the way i would have
[1:09:32] been
[1:09:33] of course the bible says moses was a
[1:09:35] meek man
[1:09:36] so i guess
[1:09:37] the poor took all of that out of him and
[1:09:40] my wife ain't got it all out of me yet
[1:09:43] i'm still arrogant and hateful and
[1:09:46] blunt but my point is
[1:09:51] god did fulfill his word
[1:09:53] but you know it was not because of
[1:09:56] israel
[1:09:57] it was because of his promise
[1:10:00] all right
[1:10:01] the part they had to be
[1:10:04] was the group of people
[1:10:06] that cried
[1:10:07] like i said with the
[1:10:09] they finally because it says they cried
[1:10:11] the problem they cried and they cried
[1:10:13] well you know right after moses went out
[1:10:15] there's crying for a delivery god you
[1:10:17] said you give us a deliver three years
[1:10:19] later
[1:10:20] you know he said you give us a delivery
[1:10:21] somebody said well i guess we missed it
[1:10:23] moses lord i guess we missed it moses
[1:10:26] but we got to have a deliverer
[1:10:28] for 40 years
[1:10:31] they cried for god
[1:10:32] to deliver them
[1:10:38] a lot of prayers in 40 years
[1:10:42] god doesn't say much about it except
[1:10:44] what we read
[1:10:46] he said i've heard the cries
[1:10:49] of my people
[1:10:51] and i've seen
[1:10:53] the afflictions
[1:10:55] that's been put on them
[1:10:56] he remembered every one of them down
[1:10:58] through there that they prayed
[1:11:00] but there was finally a group of people
[1:11:04] are you listening now
[1:11:06] finally a group of people
[1:11:09] who got in contact with god
[1:11:16] they prayed to write prayer
[1:11:21] right
[1:11:24] and god says okay
[1:11:26] your word that you're supposed to be
[1:11:29] now i'll send moses
[1:11:34] and that's what he done right
[1:11:36] you've now reached a place
[1:11:40] some of you have got to the point
[1:11:42] that you realize
[1:11:43] times
[1:11:45] the whole background of what i said
[1:11:48] you got to the place to realize the sin
[1:11:51] you've committed
[1:11:53] and you're trying to repent
[1:11:59] i've come down now
[1:12:02] well
[1:12:05] we've been 40-something years
[1:12:11] and that's the basis that a lot of
[1:12:12] people have for the return ministries
[1:12:14] and things like that
[1:12:16] that's nothing to me
[1:12:18] because i don't have no problems
[1:12:20] i've told you where i stand
[1:12:24] not against anybody or any thoughts
[1:12:28] but i just stand with me
[1:12:32] it's always been the pattern with god
[1:12:36] we'll get to it in the ages
[1:12:39] that
[1:12:41] he hears the prayers of the people
[1:12:44] but somebody
[1:12:46] now please heaven help me get this point
[1:12:50] somebody comes to a place
[1:12:54] that god really hears them
[1:12:58] it's been that never age
[1:13:02] it's been that all the times
[1:13:05] all right
[1:13:06] now if you don't get the rest of the
[1:13:08] message get this point
[1:13:11] i don't think there's a whole lot of
[1:13:12] time to raise up another group to start
[1:13:14] praying
[1:13:16] and i don't think
[1:13:18] that you'd be able to get to them what
[1:13:20] you need to get to them
[1:13:22] i think it's now
[1:13:28] something personal
[1:13:33] we are the end-time people
[1:13:37] he said well you said that 40 years ago
[1:13:40] you know what i was trying to do get
[1:13:42] somebody to believe with me
[1:13:49] trying to get somebody to believe with
[1:13:50] me
[1:13:53] well
[1:13:55] because you can't deny that i've ain't
[1:13:56] been preaching it for 40 something years
[1:13:59] you got to admit it
[1:14:02] well i had something in mind
[1:14:05] but they begin to cry and they begin to
[1:14:06] cry
[1:14:10] until finally somebody touched god
[1:14:17] and watch it in the ages
[1:14:19] that great flare-ups we'll say down
[1:14:21] through the ages
[1:14:23] there was a lot of people protested the
[1:14:25] catholic church
[1:14:27] right
[1:14:29] it had a little effect kept some
[1:14:31] controls
[1:14:32] and started with the white cliffs and
[1:14:34] the difference of printings and the and
[1:14:36] the things of getting the bibles and
[1:14:38] things down and they were well and good
[1:14:42] little sparks of hope and ray
[1:14:44] that come in that would be necessary
[1:14:47] but one day
[1:14:50] there was a man called martin luther
[1:14:54] martin luther
[1:14:57] something struck him
[1:15:02] you know what
[1:15:03] he got in touch with god
[1:15:09] god revealed to him that it was a just
[1:15:11] shall live by faith
[1:15:14] because he got himself out of the way
[1:15:21] think about that through each age as we
[1:15:22] try to cover it
[1:15:26] somebody brought god on the scene
[1:15:29] the children of israel had to be crying
[1:15:31] for a deliverer before god's going to
[1:15:32] deliver
[1:15:34] you and i are going to have to be crying
[1:15:37] out for a deliverer before there's going
[1:15:39] to be a rapture of things because
[1:15:42] remember the rapture is not the next
[1:15:44] thing the resurrection
[1:15:48] comes before the rapture
[1:15:51] so we better be concerned about trying
[1:15:53] to get the dead out of the grave
[1:15:56] how do we do that oh we'll get us some
[1:15:58] shovels and we'll just go in
[1:16:08] you want me to tell you what's going to
[1:16:09] bring the resurrection
[1:16:12] i've told you for 40 something years i
[1:16:14] don't know where you've listened to it
[1:16:15] or not
[1:16:18] you know when we contact that faith
[1:16:22] that those before us had
[1:16:25] it will bring those out of the grave
[1:16:28] when you and i come to a place of faith
[1:16:30] revelation
[1:16:32] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:16:34] so we're going to have to come to a
[1:16:36] place but we don't deny we believe what
[1:16:39] luther talked
[1:16:41] right
[1:16:42] we believe what wesley taught
[1:16:45] well see as i said the catholic church
[1:16:47] wasn't concerned about luther
[1:16:49] but when the people
[1:16:51] begin to rally around
[1:16:54] because there was something called
[1:16:55] luther to step up
[1:16:57] now that's what we're going to cover for
[1:16:58] a second okay
[1:17:06] let's read this one go ahead number
[1:17:08] three
[1:17:09] be certain of god
[1:17:15] this i think is the little weird woman
[1:17:16] with a dead child
[1:17:18] i'm not certain i'll get to it a minute
[1:17:22] she was somewhat like abraham was
[1:17:25] called to give everything she had
[1:17:29] laying down the sticks you know and the
[1:17:30] thing that's who this really was then
[1:17:33] laying it on the altar of sacrifice
[1:17:36] maybe you've called
[1:17:39] maybe your call like that this morning
[1:17:44] give up your ways
[1:17:46] give up your unbelief
[1:17:48] give up everything
[1:17:50] you got
[1:17:52] and then take the oil
[1:17:54] and the word and mix it together
[1:17:57] and put it on the altar of
[1:17:58] self-sacrifice
[1:18:01] you'll find out
[1:18:04] it'll call god
[1:18:07] on the scene
[1:18:08] as certain as i'm standing in this
[1:18:10] pulpit
[1:18:12] what's going to call god on the scene
[1:18:15] get rid of our sin
[1:18:18] get straightened up and get our unbelief
[1:18:20] out of the way
[1:18:22] and take to all the holy spirit
[1:18:26] and the
[1:18:27] word
[1:18:28] and put it together by revelation
[1:18:32] and realize where we're at
[1:18:34] all right
[1:18:36] now let's read this one because this is
[1:18:38] the thought
[1:18:40] go ahead to to invisible union i would
[1:18:43] invite you to read listen or read to the
[1:18:45] whole message of invisible union and
[1:18:47] especially if you would like to title
[1:18:49] some messages and listen was uh go awake
[1:18:52] jesus uh
[1:18:54] calling jesus on the scene there's many
[1:18:57] titles
[1:18:58] of sermons if you'd listen to them it
[1:19:00] would really help you
[1:19:02] you know all right
[1:19:03] well watch what he starts paragraph 52
[1:19:06] but then watch again to the spiritual
[1:19:08] church
[1:19:10] how that group of people called out the
[1:19:12] elected
[1:19:14] through every revival in martin luther
[1:19:17] it happened the same way in the
[1:19:18] reformation it happened the same thing
[1:19:21] in the time of john wesley it happened
[1:19:23] the same thing when the pentecostals
[1:19:25] first started
[1:19:26] they dropped them women right back in
[1:19:29] line with the word
[1:19:32] and then they drift away
[1:19:34] and she goes right back over into chaos
[1:19:38] so you see that messenger comes
[1:19:40] line up for a while then they go into
[1:19:41] chaos what
[1:19:43] but then the time that the prophet then
[1:19:46] the time that the people
[1:19:48] are ready to line up
[1:19:50] there's a message
[1:19:53] comes forth
[1:19:54] and they line up with it
[1:20:00] see take each age and bring it down
[1:20:02] but we just stay over going run quicker
[1:20:04] through luther wesley
[1:20:06] see the people in the age before begin
[1:20:09] to get away from who would columba
[1:20:11] yeah
[1:20:13] all right in his message in the doings
[1:20:16] and people started crying for a
[1:20:18] deliverer
[1:20:19] and god answered that with martin luther
[1:20:23] when the people began to cry
[1:20:26] all right
[1:20:28] luther was a messenger one day of
[1:20:29] justification the church lined right
[1:20:31] with it some of them the rest of them
[1:20:33] continued on
[1:20:35] wesley come with sanctification the
[1:20:37] church lined right with it pentecost
[1:20:39] come with the restoration of the gifts
[1:20:40] the church ran right with it the elected
[1:20:43] of that day
[1:20:44] and they faded then faded away went
[1:20:47] right back off in denominationalisms and
[1:20:50] went right on out with the rest of them
[1:20:52] all of them right down along the line
[1:20:56] now but did you notice but
[1:20:58] now but you notice
[1:21:00] when the people begin to try to line up
[1:21:03] with the word
[1:21:06] there comes a fresh message
[1:21:08] from the word of god
[1:21:13] write straight to the people and they
[1:21:15] catch that message and line up every
[1:21:17] time
[1:21:19] it's just in god
[1:21:21] so that's
[1:21:22] where it's at
[1:21:24] when they begin to try to line up to the
[1:21:26] message
[1:21:28] when azusa street people begin to fade
[1:21:30] away
[1:21:32] the people begin to cry out
[1:21:34] and as they cried out
[1:21:37] god answered that with a man named
[1:21:38] william branham to bring a message
[1:21:43] but as every age went
[1:21:46] so did it go
[1:21:50] that
[1:21:51] the people begin to just
[1:21:53] fall away
[1:21:55] oh yeah they still got the books the
[1:21:56] tapes and still go to church and still
[1:21:58] do everything but i've watched this for
[1:22:00] 40 something years and i've watched
[1:22:02] churches just literally do this just
[1:22:05] falling downward downward downward
[1:22:08] you
[1:22:08] know
[1:22:10] and and just doing that
[1:22:12] lula too
[1:22:14] okay
[1:22:16] but you see
[1:22:18] that doesn't have anything to do with it
[1:22:20] and let me make you understand one thing
[1:22:23] plain
[1:22:26] okay plain
[1:22:28] you wait
[1:22:30] this is plain
[1:22:33] we're not looking for another messenger
[1:22:34] to come like the brother said wednesday
[1:22:36] there's no place to put an eighth church
[1:22:38] age messenger in this church ages the
[1:22:40] eighth
[1:22:41] you can't do that
[1:22:44] all right
[1:22:46] but it didn't end when the prophet was
[1:22:50] here the reason you know it didn't end
[1:22:53] is because instead of the rapture coming
[1:22:56] dire
[1:22:57] the people have dwindled away from the
[1:23:00] real truth
[1:23:01] now they're trying to straighten out the
[1:23:03] prophet
[1:23:07] we don't have to look for another
[1:23:08] messenger
[1:23:10] we've already got the message
[1:23:14] this prophet brought the life's message
[1:23:17] but he spoke of things that was not
[1:23:20] fulfilled
[1:23:22] how did a group of people
[1:23:24] would become the word made flesh
[1:23:28] and withstand satan
[1:23:31] and become an invincible army that he
[1:23:34] couldn't
[1:23:35] do anything with
[1:23:39] because it's to end up all things
[1:23:45] not somebody else jump up not brother
[1:23:47] dale to jump up and take over and
[1:23:50] straighten everybody out
[1:23:54] i found out a long time ago i have
[1:23:56] trouble keeping me straight
[1:23:59] what everybody else is doing that's
[1:24:01] their business
[1:24:03] i'm just trying to keep this old boy in
[1:24:05] line
[1:24:05] and to try to preach and to help you to
[1:24:08] see
[1:24:09] what the truth is for the hour that
[1:24:11] we're living
[1:24:16] but i know and realized too that it's
[1:24:17] not done by one person
[1:24:24] it has to be done by the bride
[1:24:28] the prophet brought the message
[1:24:30] as it said martin luther god answered
[1:24:34] the call
[1:24:35] with a man named martin luther
[1:24:38] and he brought the message of the just
[1:24:40] shall live by faith
[1:24:41] when that began to dwindle down we just
[1:24:43] read it
[1:24:45] god
[1:24:46] saw the cries of the people
[1:24:50] that those methodists i mean those uh
[1:24:53] lutherans began to cry out
[1:24:56] other little off today
[1:24:58] and god sent john wesley
[1:25:02] when they begin to dry up and denominate
[1:25:06] he's in azusa street
[1:25:09] with the restoration of the gifts
[1:25:12] when that began to dry up he sent a
[1:25:14] prophet
[1:25:16] to bring us the message
[1:25:20] now that's drying up around the world
[1:25:22] right
[1:25:24] go over season they have great effects
[1:25:27] why because they're not so down in
[1:25:29] unbelief
[1:25:31] they're sincere people that can if they
[1:25:33] can see anything they'll believe it
[1:25:36] right
[1:25:37] but here
[1:25:38] i don't know
[1:25:41] there could be anointed ones
[1:25:45] sure they talk about the dead right the
[1:25:47] secret but that could be anointed once
[1:25:50] we just don't see it
[1:25:54] where's the cry
[1:26:00] you understand what i'm getting at i'm
[1:26:02] getting at lula georgia
[1:26:05] where's the cry in the hearts of the
[1:26:06] people
[1:26:09] when the bible said they would sign cry
[1:26:11] for the abomination done in the city
[1:26:19] i don't throw off on these brothers it's
[1:26:20] gone off on wrong doctrines
[1:26:24] come on they got their own reward
[1:26:28] but they're human beings
[1:26:32] and i told you
[1:26:34] little wildfires better no fire at all
[1:26:38] at least they tried
[1:26:39] instead of
[1:26:40] oh we're just waiting
[1:26:43] we don't know what to wait on
[1:26:45] but we're gonna wait
[1:26:49] what about the signing crying
[1:26:53] let them do their own signing and crying
[1:26:56] i have enough problems keeping myself
[1:26:58] we're praying
[1:27:05] have you ever tried to pray for somebody
[1:27:07] that was against you
[1:27:12] you know
[1:27:15] it's kind of hard to do
[1:27:23] you say oh no well then you lied
[1:27:28] it's hard to
[1:27:29] sign crying this day
[1:27:32] but you know that was the ones that they
[1:27:34] put the mark on
[1:27:36] in the scripture
[1:27:38] was them that sighed and cried for the
[1:27:40] abominations done in the city
[1:27:42] they received a mark which was the
[1:27:44] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:27:47] we are expecting an outpouring from
[1:27:49] heaven
[1:27:50] as to be the final anointing
[1:27:53] of the baptism of the holy ghost in such
[1:27:56] a high form
[1:27:57] until god and man is to become one
[1:28:01] amen
[1:28:03] but do we sign and cry
[1:28:14] brother bran i'm going to resume with
[1:28:15] the ages he's talking about the ages
[1:28:17] coming down
[1:28:19] he's talking about pentecost
[1:28:22] and he said
[1:28:24] we know that there must be a necessity
[1:28:28] of necessity be a great
[1:28:31] be a return of dynamic power
[1:28:34] and watch the believers sense this in
[1:28:36] their spirit and begin to cry to god for
[1:28:38] an outpouring
[1:28:40] such as it was in the
[1:28:42] first century
[1:28:44] he's talking about the outpouring
[1:28:47] what seemed to be the answer
[1:28:49] came as many begin to speak in tongues
[1:28:52] and manifest gifts of the spirit
[1:28:54] it was then believed that this indeed
[1:28:56] was a long-awaited restoration
[1:28:59] he told me azusa street
[1:29:01] it was not
[1:29:03] for the latter rain
[1:29:04] can only come after the former rain
[1:29:07] which is a spring or teaching rain
[1:29:11] see they thought azusa street
[1:29:13] was the great outpouring to take us in
[1:29:20] it was a great outpouring
[1:29:25] but yet it wasn't
[1:29:27] what was going to have
[1:29:29] amen
[1:29:33] look right above there on
[1:29:34] number five brothers pull it up whatever
[1:29:37] particularly in mind is this
[1:29:39] about the turn of the century
[1:29:41] the hunger for god was generated in the
[1:29:43] philadelphian age
[1:29:46] brought a cry for the spirit of god
[1:29:49] and when the cry was answered by god
[1:29:51] sending forth manifestations in tongues
[1:29:55] interpretation prophecy a group
[1:29:57] immediately and most contrary to the
[1:29:59] word
[1:30:00] grew up a doctrine that tom's was the
[1:30:03] evidence and then get
[1:30:05] being baptized with the holy ghost
[1:30:09] instead of going on with what they were
[1:30:11] calling for
[1:30:13] they denominated
[1:30:16] brother branham in the steel book said
[1:30:17] it like that he said the people were
[1:30:19] cabbage down
[1:30:22] it didn't say they'd leave the message
[1:30:24] and go away and do this other
[1:30:27] they'd cabbage down
[1:30:32] that's what you see most people are
[1:30:33] doing now
[1:30:35] that's the thing i fought for 40
[1:30:37] something years
[1:30:38] is for this church to become so relaxed
[1:30:41] until we think that we're the only group
[1:30:43] that's got it
[1:30:45] and we think that we are ready
[1:30:52] you know
[1:30:55] i think god has been among us and done
[1:30:57] marvelous things
[1:30:59] i agree with that
[1:31:01] i believe it i believe hebrews 13 8.
[1:31:06] but what i believe is that ought to
[1:31:07] start a cry
[1:31:08] into our hearts
[1:31:10] for god
[1:31:11] to move on the scene in our lives
[1:31:15] lord if you'd ever get old brother
[1:31:17] sister so-and-so straightened up boy
[1:31:19] we'd be ready to go
[1:31:22] oh yeah we'd be ready to go
[1:31:26] well you know what that's the biggest
[1:31:27] unbeliever in the crowd
[1:31:32] but get the point now and i'll finish
[1:31:36] the people had to be calling out in the
[1:31:37] days of moses
[1:31:39] for god to send a deliverer
[1:31:42] he just answered the cry
[1:31:45] when the right group of people
[1:31:48] got the right
[1:31:51] agreement together a connection
[1:31:54] then god
[1:31:55] brought the man on the scene it wasn't
[1:31:58] he wasn't listening to those others
[1:32:00] no he hears all prayers
[1:32:03] but somebody touched him
[1:32:06] somebody got to a place that
[1:32:09] they called him on the scene
[1:32:12] well you know
[1:32:13] that's what i tried to explain about
[1:32:15] martin luther
[1:32:18] somebody contacted god
[1:32:20] the people were crying out for a
[1:32:22] deliverer
[1:32:24] and god sent
[1:32:27] martin luther with the message
[1:32:29] of the just shall live by faith
[1:32:33] the lutherans died away and got
[1:32:34] denominating up and doing
[1:32:37] the people begin to cry
[1:32:41] he sent john wesley
[1:32:44] all right
[1:32:47] they begin to drop and die
[1:32:49] he's in azusa street
[1:32:53] they begin to denominate and drive
[1:33:00] you know there's just a street with
[1:33:01] trinitarians
[1:33:04] the oneness doctrine never come to about
[1:33:06] 1912.
[1:33:09] and see brother around him didn't come
[1:33:10] along to
[1:33:11] straighten up the thoughts about the
[1:33:13] oneness and the trinity
[1:33:16] we see people begin to cry
[1:33:18] and god sent them signs and wonders in
[1:33:20] the zeus street
[1:33:24] and they begin to cry out for
[1:33:26] deliverance and he sent them
[1:33:28] people
[1:33:30] oral robbers
[1:33:33] the shulers the swaggers
[1:33:38] that's why i said don't throw off on
[1:33:39] them people
[1:33:41] god used them
[1:33:47] they were in a lot of respects the
[1:33:48] answer to the prayers of the people
[1:33:51] because they didn't know how to pray
[1:33:55] but somebody must have touched god
[1:33:57] about the promises he made
[1:34:00] that in the last days the word would be
[1:34:04] restored back to its fullness
[1:34:08] that dwelt in the book of acts and dwelt
[1:34:10] into
[1:34:12] the lord jesus
[1:34:16] christ people begin to cry out for that
[1:34:21] who was it ff bosworth
[1:34:23] prayed and prayed
[1:34:24] he saw brother branham one day and saw
[1:34:26] the sign he said that's what i prayed
[1:34:29] for
[1:34:31] he said son as he was dying listen the
[1:34:34] other day to him
[1:34:35] he said son
[1:34:36] take this message
[1:34:40] to the foreign fields he said before
[1:34:43] these others get there and mess it up
[1:34:48] to take it to the people
[1:34:53] he said i believe you're a prophet
[1:34:58] there was a lot of good people down
[1:34:59] through there that god heard their
[1:35:00] prayers
[1:35:02] and he sent brother random on the scene
[1:35:07] all right
[1:35:10] but now where are we at
[1:35:14] right amen
[1:35:16] where are we at folks
[1:35:21] it has started going down
[1:35:23] what's going to happen
[1:35:26] somebody's got to cry out for a
[1:35:27] deliverance
[1:35:28] but just remember not looking for
[1:35:30] another messenger not looking for
[1:35:32] another man not looking at that because
[1:35:34] he's already told us what would take
[1:35:37] place do you understand me
[1:35:39] he told abraham
[1:35:41] they will be down there 400 years i'll
[1:35:44] bring them out with a strong hand
[1:35:47] and he did
[1:35:50] he said there would be
[1:35:52] a prophet come in the last days and
[1:35:54] declare the word of god and he did
[1:35:58] amen
[1:36:02] that's right
[1:36:04] but like he said to abraham
[1:36:07] go out with a strong hand
[1:36:10] though jonas said power
[1:36:13] strong
[1:36:18] right
[1:36:22] what are you looking for brother dale
[1:36:24] i'm looking for somebody to just agree
[1:36:26] with me
[1:36:29] and of all these years i've tried to
[1:36:31] preach about what i believe would take
[1:36:33] place
[1:36:36] and you say it's exalted
[1:36:39] but no it's truth
[1:36:41] 1969 i preached one's first sermon in
[1:36:44] this message
[1:36:46] was it the bride would be the son of man
[1:36:52] of course 73 4 5
[1:36:55] certain brothers come along and started
[1:36:57] talking about son of man
[1:37:00] and the people rallied around that well
[1:37:02] that's fine
[1:37:04] because
[1:37:05] i'm not claiming seniority
[1:37:09] i'm just i just never was trying to get
[1:37:11] what they was trying to get
[1:37:16] right
[1:37:17] because i never wanted it to get to
[1:37:19] where you
[1:37:20] looking at me
[1:37:23] because you do
[1:37:25] something's going to happen and you're
[1:37:26] going to have a problem
[1:37:28] remember a few weeks ago a while back i
[1:37:30] was talking about how it
[1:37:33] if you don't honor the messenger
[1:37:35] the prophet said he'd take him off the
[1:37:37] scene
[1:37:39] that's what he said
[1:37:40] he said the church age messengers would
[1:37:42] happen he said and the pastors
[1:37:47] so if you don't honor the pastor
[1:37:48] correctly
[1:37:50] he will take him off the scene
[1:37:53] that's why i have whistled here twice
[1:37:56] that some of you were saying that i was
[1:37:57] a prophet
[1:37:58] and i said no
[1:38:01] i do not have the ministry of a prophet
[1:38:03] i'm not catholic
[1:38:05] i ain't you know set for that
[1:38:07] leave me alone
[1:38:09] it wouldn't do no good for you to
[1:38:11] believe that i am that or i would be
[1:38:12] that wouldn't make no
[1:38:14] that's difference leave me the word that
[1:38:17] i am that i can preach
[1:38:20] teach the people
[1:38:22] guide the people
[1:38:26] into the revealed word of the hour that
[1:38:28] has already been brought to you and i
[1:38:31] and to create a desire in your heart to
[1:38:33] cry and pray
[1:38:37] for this message to be made alive
[1:38:40] in our lives
[1:38:41] to search our lives for sin
[1:38:45] and then to move on with it
[1:38:48] god's waiting on you and i yes
[1:38:51] adoption time
[1:38:55] when he can pour in his fullness what is
[1:38:58] that what was the holy ghost given for
[1:39:00] number seven waiting on you and i the
[1:39:02] church is waiting on you and me and you
[1:39:04] adoption time when god can pour into it
[1:39:07] to us his fullness his power his
[1:39:09] resurrection that when the church in
[1:39:11] christ becomes so close together until
[1:39:13] christ becomes visible among us and
[1:39:15] raises the dead and we go in the rapture
[1:39:18] so the visibility of christ among us is
[1:39:20] going to raise the dead the faith that's
[1:39:22] connected to each one of those ages is
[1:39:25] going to bring them out
[1:39:31] god's waiting
[1:39:33] as the ego stirreth his nest
[1:39:35] to get his church in order
[1:39:38] he's waiting on you and me
[1:39:41] may he grant the blessings
[1:39:44] that's for the elect's sake he says
[1:39:47] it's overlapped
[1:39:49] it's lapped over time

[1:39:53] days of noah

[1:39:59] conference number nine
[1:40:03] what is your reply i'll serve you lord
[1:40:06] i want the holy ghost

[1:40:37] be certain of god god's waiting he's
[1:40:39] been
[1:40:40] if you've been anointed and prayed watch
[1:40:42] about healings and things

[1:40:46] about it

[1:40:49] day and until the next healer comes
[1:40:52] through the city he's waiting to see
[1:40:54] your reaction
[1:40:56] on your faith
[1:40:57] not walk back next day and say well i
[1:41:00] feel so bad
[1:41:01] i don't guess i got healed you're not
[1:41:04] fit for the prayer line
[1:41:06] in the first place
[1:41:10] right
[1:41:12] every present water from the rock this
[1:41:14] great pentecostal move today god is
[1:41:17] waiting for you
[1:41:19] to call him on the scene
[1:41:22] you're not
[1:41:23] watch you're not out of speaking
[1:41:25] distance with him
[1:41:27] you're not out of speaking distance with
[1:41:29] him
[1:41:31] though we've done wrong and sinned and
[1:41:33] turned our backs on him and done things
[1:41:36] we ought not to do
[1:41:38] but yet he's with us
[1:41:40] christ said he'd be with us
[1:41:45] god's waiting a true sign overlooked
[1:41:50] it's some part you have to do
[1:41:54] god's waiting for his church to call him

[1:42:01] call his servant into action
[1:42:03] and the servant can't get into action
[1:42:06] till the people prays
[1:42:10] i've seen that for 40 something years
[1:42:12] folks and wondered why and cried and
[1:42:14] prayed
[1:42:16] that i couldn't get nobody to believe
[1:42:18] what i was talking about
[1:42:20] did i believe the prophet talked about
[1:42:22] it
[1:42:24] or what we would be
[1:42:28] well i guess in a way
[1:42:32] no
[1:42:35] look what he says
[1:42:38] on the message
[1:42:39] and thy seed shall possess the gates of
[1:42:41] the enemy
[1:42:43] if you'll stay with the word then god's
[1:42:45] seeing
[1:42:46] if you abide in me and my word in you
[1:42:49] his he cannot deny is his word
[1:42:52] then there'll be a time sometime when
[1:42:54] you'll be taken out and set aside
[1:42:57] and be given something that's genuine
[1:43:00] hallelujah power of the almighty god
[1:43:04] which god is waiting for his children
[1:43:07] but they just won't line up
[1:43:10] when they come to that testing time
[1:43:13] will you accept it
[1:43:15] well the church will put me out
[1:43:18] all right there you are
[1:43:20] then go
[1:43:22] that's not abraham's seed something like
[1:43:24] that
[1:43:28] lifting him out of history that's why i
[1:43:30] said there's a lot of these messages
[1:43:32] he's talking about healings and things
[1:43:34] it's the same today he's waiting
[1:43:36] anxiously for his people to call him on
[1:43:38] the scene to action

[1:43:43] you to call him on the scene

[1:43:57] just go ahead and do it then no you know
[1:43:59] what he meant

[1:44:24] i thought that was kind of reverse
[1:44:29] well the older i get the more sickness i
[1:44:32] get doesn't mean i'm more sinful

[1:45:08] i'm talking about arthritis i ain't
[1:45:10] talking about some guy
[1:45:13] i'm talking about this old age

[1:45:38] can't turn it loose
[1:45:42] that's how old i'm getting
[1:45:47] because i'm afraid my legs grabbing
[1:45:48] under me
[1:45:50] right well why don't you sit down and
[1:45:51] take it easy no way
[1:45:55] he gets this boy he's gonna fight a
[1:45:57] battle
[1:46:00] he's gonna struggle to get me
[1:46:05] that's why i say how you doing wonderful
[1:46:13] why don't you tell somebody you're sick
[1:46:15] does that help
[1:46:18] does it ever help anybody tell them
[1:46:20] you're sick
[1:46:23] no
[1:46:24] but listen
[1:46:28] look what he says here about a few
[1:46:29] things
[1:46:30] call him on the scene
[1:46:32] watch him go up in to move us
[1:46:35] watch him do the supreme
[1:46:38] watch him do things that man will wonder
[1:46:41] and scratch their heads and don't
[1:46:43] understand
[1:46:46] he's the historical god
[1:46:49] and a present day god
[1:46:52] he's waiting to be called out of history
[1:46:57] some of you have backslid and done with
[1:46:59] that which is wrong
[1:47:01] and you lost your joy
[1:47:04] and your water is dried up
[1:47:06] he's still in speaking distance
[1:47:08] he follows you he knows every move you
[1:47:11] make and everything you do
[1:47:13] he's longing to hear you call him
[1:47:16] on the scene
[1:47:24] you know what he's doing
[1:47:26] he's here tonight waiting
[1:47:29] to be proved
[1:47:34] you know what you ought to do
[1:47:36] we're to do like they
[1:47:38] wake jesus
[1:47:40] that's
[1:47:41] in
[1:47:42] us
[1:47:45] how many do you need of that
[1:47:48] wake jesus in us
[1:47:53] oh no if we get it everybody else you
[1:47:55] know oh we're doing great
[1:47:59] wake jesus in us
[1:48:03] lord come on the scene amen
[1:48:06] move among us
[1:48:08] and i listen folks
[1:48:13] i'm not one that prays for god to send
[1:48:16] signs and wonders among us
[1:48:22] i pray for god to come among us
[1:48:28] now if god comes among us
[1:48:30] there's always going to be signs and
[1:48:32] wonders where god's at
[1:48:34] so you pray for the signs and wonders
[1:48:36] you pray for the dew and this i pray for
[1:48:38] the presence of god
[1:48:41] amen that's right
[1:48:43] you pray for the speaking in tongues or
[1:48:45] shouting the crying the good feelings
[1:48:47] i pray for the word
[1:48:50] to be opened
[1:48:52] and then i've got what i asked for
[1:48:58] you mean you don't want to see signs and
[1:49:00] wonders brother that walk come on
[1:49:06] they want the word first
[1:49:08] then signs and wonders followers the
[1:49:10] word
[1:49:12] as brother harris used to say it he said
[1:49:16] well believers don't follow signs signs
[1:49:18] follow believers
[1:49:20] because that's true
[1:49:22] you get a believer here god's going to
[1:49:24] be here
[1:49:27] like i said about your brother wednesday
[1:49:28] night
[1:49:29] i you know me and him sat down tall we'd
[1:49:31] probably differ
[1:49:33] he might have said some things you
[1:49:34] didn't agree with him
[1:49:35] nobody but there's one thing about it he
[1:49:37] had a good goal a good thought in mind
[1:49:40] all right
[1:49:43] now that's what i'm looking for
[1:49:45] somebody with a positive attitude
[1:49:49] well i don't know
[1:49:51] maybe one of these days
[1:49:54] just remember we don't have a lot of
[1:49:57] days
[1:50:02] but we got a great god let's stand
[1:50:04] come on brothers
[1:50:06] we've got a great god
[1:50:10] god's waiting on you and i to call him
[1:50:11] on the scene
[1:50:15] you need healing call him on the scene
[1:50:18] you know how you call him on the scene
[1:50:19] remind him of what he said
[1:50:25] i mean if i told you i'd be down at your
[1:50:26] house this evening at five o'clock
[1:50:29] and i didn't go you know what you'd say
[1:50:31] you said she was
[1:50:34] you lied
[1:50:37] did you mean it to start with
[1:50:40] well why not call god on the scene
[1:50:44] and say lord you promised
[1:50:46] amen
[1:50:48] you know what i remind him every day
[1:50:50] he told me years ago that you'll be here
[1:50:52] you'll be there with your offspring
[1:50:54] you give me other scriptures to fit in
[1:50:55] with it and time you know what i do when
[1:50:58] i pray i said lord remember your promise
[1:51:03] are you trying to make god do it no no i
[1:51:05] got enough sense to know better now i'm
[1:51:07] just reminding him what he's saying
[1:51:11] right
[1:51:13] i mean i tell one of my kids i said look
[1:51:15] i'll give you so and so you know what
[1:51:18] well no problem for them to come along
[1:51:21] and say daddy
[1:51:22] when you're going to give it to me
[1:51:26] well see i might tell them like god
[1:51:28] tells us i'll give it to you when i want
[1:51:30] to
[1:51:32] because that's what he does sometimes
[1:51:33] right
[1:51:35] but you know what ain't going to keep
[1:51:37] him doing and you know what one i like
[1:51:39] the most where the little boy wanted to
[1:51:41] bicycle you know the story
[1:51:45] he come to his dad and he kept saying
[1:51:46] daddy
[1:51:49] are you going to get me a bicycle
[1:51:51] and the daddy says no son
[1:51:56] it's too expensive
[1:51:58] costs too much money
[1:52:00] i'm not gonna get you the bicycle
[1:52:04] yeah but daddy
[1:52:06] you told me i said son i told you
[1:52:09] i'd get you a bicycle but said they are
[1:52:12] very expensive and we don't have any
[1:52:14] money
[1:52:15] something to that degree
[1:52:18] so when christmas time come there set
[1:52:20] the bicycle under the tree
[1:52:22] he said but daddy you said you couldn't
[1:52:24] get he said no i didn't say i couldn't
[1:52:25] get it he said i just told you i wasn't
[1:52:27] gonna get it he said cause i already had
[1:52:29] it
[1:52:30] when you asked me
[1:52:32] well you know god's already got it
[1:52:37] just remind him amen
[1:52:40] i quote that scripture almost every
[1:52:42] service right
[1:52:44] he sent his word and healed us
[1:52:46] and delivered us from destruction
[1:52:51] that's just reminding him
[1:52:53] you think he gets mad because i remind
[1:52:55] him
[1:52:57] no he gets mad when i won't remind him
[1:53:02] because he begins to wonder you mean you
[1:53:04] don't believe me
[1:53:06] come on kids come on folks we're adults
[1:53:10] your kids begin to doubt whether you'll
[1:53:12] do something or not
[1:53:13] maybe
[1:53:14] maybe in one respect you got a lot to
[1:53:16] write down but i'm talking about really
[1:53:17] the right pla you know and the kids
[1:53:19] begin to doubt
[1:53:21] you're doing something when you've never
[1:53:23] broke your word before
[1:53:28] god wants somebody to call him on the
[1:53:30] scene
[1:53:31] because he said it
[1:53:34] lord you said you'd be with me
[1:53:40] and then be with me
[1:53:43] we pray before we go somewhere right in
[1:53:45] the car or something right
[1:53:46] and we pray lord take care of us turn
[1:53:48] back
[1:53:50] don't just pray for thyre
[1:53:52] because you've got to die in the back
[1:53:57] kids will be going somewhere something
[1:53:58] said daddy we're going to be gone three
[1:53:59] or four days i don't pray well lord take
[1:54:01] care of them getting there i said lord
[1:54:03] take care of getting there and bring him
[1:54:04] back home
[1:54:06] because that's the other side of the
[1:54:08] journey what do we got boys
[1:54:10] i believe
[1:54:12] go ahead
[1:54:16] i believe god
[1:54:18] i believe god

[1:54:26] he's waiting on you and i to call him
[1:54:31] say lord
[1:54:33] i love you

[1:54:38] sometimes i walk through the house
[1:54:40] you know just
[1:54:42] and they say lord i love you
[1:54:48] i'm gonna love you
[1:54:52] well the prairie green said run around
[1:54:53] and told him one day he said
[1:54:55] brother perry said when you feeling
[1:54:56] close to you
[1:54:59] he said tell him that brother branham
[1:55:01] loves him
[1:55:05] i believe you love god don't you
[1:55:09] but why can't we love it
[1:55:13] you know what
[1:55:14] to a lot of people

[1:55:22] dollars than to say i love you
[1:55:26] we went to churches
[1:55:28] we've been places

[1:57:13] because you can't get down and pray
[1:57:15] without ceasing and live as a human life
[1:57:18] but you pray without ceasing is just
[1:57:20] when you think about it you say lord i
