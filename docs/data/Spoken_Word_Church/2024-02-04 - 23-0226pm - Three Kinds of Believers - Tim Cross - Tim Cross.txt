praise the Lord amen it's so wonderful I just feel right at home here with you all and I just appreciate the goodness of the Lord I I couldn't stay in the bullpen any longer I had to come charging out praise the Lord so God bless you where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty amen so we just feel right at home in his presence this evening and just going to invite you to go right into your Bibles and we'll read from Colossians chapter 3 you know I I've got a reputation for being a long- winded preacher and uh hard as I try brother brother Samuel I just can't seem to outlive that or do that down but uh and I blame the people for pulling they pull it right out of me but uh and I I joke with some of the uh other ministers friends of mine I said you know I hate to Short change people they've come all that way and you know it's uh so I hope you don't feel short chains but I guess the the the mind can only contain as much as the seat can sustain so uh some Churches don't have enough padding on the p for preachers like me but um anyway when the Lord is speaking and moving and and having his way it time passes very quickly and we just want the Lord to have his way I want to preach this evening on three kinds of Christians and I know brother Ram preached about the make believer the unbeliever and the True Believer but I'm going to go a little different direction and let's uh just before we read in the scriptures let's approach the author of the word again Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your goodness and your mercy Lord as the words of that song were sung Lord all my life Lord you've been faithful you've been merciful and Lord we just we can't help but love you and thank you Father for all that you are to us and as we approach your word this evening we ask you again Lord to come in our midst and break the bread of life to our hearts Lord make the words come off of these pages and live in our lives and just have your way in our midst this evening be glorified in our midst we thank you for it and ask in Jesus name we pray amen amen we'll read Colossians chapter 3 uh: 12-1 17 and then jump down to verse 23 put on therefore now we don't want to be put on but the Bible says put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also you are called in one body and be you thankful let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him verse 23 says and whatsoever you do do it heartily as unto the Lord and not unto men knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance for you serve the Lord Christ for he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done and there is no respective persons also in Jude chapter 1 one want to read um beginning at verse number 20 but ye beloved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life and of some have compassion making a difference and others Sav with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garments spotted by the flesh now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy to the only wise God our savior be glory and Majesty dominion and power both now and ever amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated I want to just take a simple thought all tonight real real basic message but three kinds of Christians and the first uh kind of Christian I'm going to describe to you as as what I would call a casual Christian or a leoan Christian you know the the the thing about the leoan age it was it was defined as a lukewarm age neither hot nor cold and I I find it seems like there's a spirit that is prevalent in the world today that says you know you just need to blend in you you know you just don't don't be on the extreme you know just uh if you've got a conviction if you've got something you know just kind of keep that to yourself and don't rock the boat don't make any waves you know and so that uh that prevailing spirit in the world tends to want to creep into the Christian church as well you know I know we um some years ago we lived on a a nice property we did not own it but um it was about 60 or so acres of land and we had a little portion of that with our mobile home on it I'd get out there and mow the grass and all around that property was was Woods or a little forest and a pond and all these nice things but I brother Bob I noticed every time I mowed the grass I had to go over a few inches and push back the weeds and the briers and all the other things that every day was trying to creep into that lawn and take that lawn away from me and I think that is how we have to do as Christians you know we have to always be on the offensive otherwise the devil's just going to crowd in day by day little by little and he's going to push us into a corner where we don't have anything amen and and he's overtaken what is rightfully ours and so we we have to be conscious of of how the devil works and then we have to be willing to stand out to be set apart amen and and I I'll tell you this that's really what the world is longing for and looking for when you go to school or you're at work and you're out in the world you know you think well you know I just need to keep this to myself I don't I don't need to be so different or or or so stand out so much but I want to tell you your your friends at school you know they would love to have parents that love them as much as your parents love you oh your parents have curfews they have expectations they love you and they want to protect you and keep you from the harms of the world and your friends at school make may make fun of you because of how strict and how disciplined and all those things you are but the truth of the matter is inside they would love to have parents that thought enough of them and cared enough for them to want to shelter them from the things of the world so you know they they may make fun of you and poke fun of you and make you feel despised or belittle but really what what they're looking for is to have that same thing in their lives so if you can be unashamed and unafraid to share your testimony and let your light shine before them it's you know you're going to stand apart from their other worldly friends who are just like them and they're going to come to you one day and they're going to want to know what this reality is that makes you glit makes you glow instead of glitter they're going to know there's something about you that has a power that has a Radiance that has a warmth but you've got to be willing to let that shine through you or otherwise you know the devil he can't destroy you you're Gods you're God's Property but what he can do is marginalize you he can try to make you you know just compress into his little box and silence your voice and and and and and mute you as a Christian amen but the holy spirit is here to give us a voice to give us Liberty Li y Amen to make us comfortable in who we are as Sons and Daughters of God but the prophet of God says this in the breach he said a woman just called up another woman said you know I'm Episcopalian said I spoke in tongues the other day I believe I Reed the Holy Ghost but sh don't tell nobody the prophet of God said I doubt that very much you might have spoke on in tongues but you set a Man on Fire how is he going to sit still that's right you can't do it could you imagine Peter James and John and them in the upper room saying oh we got the Holy Ghost now and maybe we better just keep still brother through windows and doors and everything they went out into the street acting like a bunch of drunks that's the real Holy Ghost amen and I tell you what you know years ago I I heard a brother and he said you know the Holy Ghost doesn't come the way it used to we don't receive the Holy Ghost the way they did on the the day of Pentecost in the book of Acts and I thought brother if you ever get the Holy Ghost I got you know it comes the same way and it does the same things everybody might not speak in tongues everybody might not shout or dance in the spirit but when the power of God grips your life you and everybody around you is going to know you got a hold of something and something got a hold of you and it's Jesus Christ Living himself amen it's not you acting it's not you replicating it's not you trying to imitate something it's the very life of God channeled through you amen as an expression of his life amen and it's a it's a life-changing power but you know the the the Casual Christian doesn't want to make a SE yeah doesn't stand out he just tries to blend in with the crowd you know I'm not picking on anybody I I don't know most of you but you know and and I was young once too and I had young friends and Believers and you know they'd they'd be out in public somewhere and they'd pray and you know instead of just bowing their heads and really praying where everybody knew they was praying they just kind of close their eyes and wipe their brow like their eye was itching see you need some more courage right you need to be bold in your faith now me on the other hand and I'm again I'm not exalting myself but I would go I remember one time when I was about 16 or 17 I was just getting old enough to go out and and and and uh fellowship or congregate with some of the young people and of all places we went to a rockola cafe y'all know what a rockola or some of you and and if if you don't know great and if you do know you don't have to pretend like you don't but but we were we were here of rockold brother said and of all things I asked him to turn the music down because you know we was trying to fellowship and they Rock ho is based around rock and roll music so they're bling and and and one young sister said my amen the G to go into a rockola and ask him to turn the music down but you know I it's just who I was I was like well the music's really loud I can't hear I can't enjoy the fellowship amen but it's okay to stand up for what you believe it's okay to speak out amen it's okay to be different amen because you are different we are pilgrims and strangers sojourning here in this world even when Israel was was uh leaving Egypt and on their way through all of those lands and those peoples they passed through amen I I just say like this God told him you are passing through on your way to none of those places are your destination none of those peoples are yours amen you're just journeying through that on your way to somewhere where you belong so it's okay to stand out it's okay to be differentiated because you came from a different place and you're going to a different place I've said this you can all you can go through an airport and you can tell a lot about where people come from or where they're going by the way they're dressed and there's a reason we dress different there's a reason we act different there's a reason we are different because we come from somewhere and we go in somewhere and the way we act and look amen says something about where we came from and where we're going amen amen right I'm in the heating and air conditioning business just recently I moved back into the sales world but you know you you use natural types to represent spiritual things and I say this God has not called us to be thermometers thermometers only react to what's going around them and tell you what the temperature is God has not called us to be thermometers God has called us to be thermostats amen because a thermostat knows what the temperature is but it's connected to a source of energy that has the power to make a difference that's it amen so you can put a thermometer Amen in a cold room and it just gets cold but if you put a thermostat in the cold room it's connected to a source of heat and it detects what's going on as it we need to make a change about what's going on right here and we need to channel this power Amen to warm the atmosphere and a true Christian amen can walk into a heated situation and cool it down amen you can take control because you are connected to an omnipotent Force Hallelujah and you are the connection between that atmosphere and a Heavenly atmosphere amen oh I feel like preaching now you can come into a cold Church service and say it sounds like things need to warm up a little bit around here I'm going to clap my hands I'm going to lift my voice amen I'm going to praise my God and I'm going to warm the room up so God can have his way yes sir amen we're not here to blend in I'm thinking about three Hebrew children amen they got cast into a fiery furnace one day amen they said we're not going to bend we're not going to Bow and as the world found out they wouldn't burn either amen why because they were connected Amen to the god of the prophet and they said we're not going to bow to an image that some man made of him amen we know the prophet and we know his God and we refuse to Bow and the prophet of God said when those boys enter that fiery furnace wormwood stepped up and said God I'll go Gabriel stepped up and said God I'll go and God said no you won't those boys didn't stand there for you they stood there on Earth for me and now I'm going to go stand with them they were unaffected by the the fire all the fire did was loose their bands and express God's glory even the king had to testify didn't we throw three in there because one has joined them to them and he has the form the fourth man is liken to the Son of God hallelujah I don't want to be a casual Christian tonight the second kind of Christian is a costume Christian right brother we all know what a costume is some people wear those at Halloween they've been hanging something up in the closet all year and they put on on Halloween and they come out looking like a skeleton or come out looking like a former president or some Hollywood star or some movie star you know and they dress up and in appearance they take on another person's identity and you know we think about that that and say you know that's that's a satanic holiday really amen but people do the same thing on Sundays and Wednesdays they go into the closet and they pull out a costume of Christianity and they put it on and they drive to church amen and they show up and look and act like a Christian like a message believer oh and there's not a there's not a spot on their garment it's in pristine condition because it's rarely warn amen amen and they appear perfect and spotless and without blemish oh my amen they've never made a mistake in their life but if they make it home amen without cutting somebody off in traffic or doing some ungodly deed amen they put that Christian costume back in the closet and on Monday morning they're just as worldly as their co-workers or their classmates or their unbelieving family amen why because Christianity to them is not a reality it's something they put on to give others a false impression of who they are I don't want to be a costume Christian aen was a costume Christian he kept a Goen wedge and a Babylonian garment stashed away in the closet and I don't know why and I'll probably never get the chance to ask him why but the only thing I can imagine was he had a backup plan just in case the God of Israel ever failed to make good on his promises aen could costume himself as a Babylonian and Escape The Tyranny and the death and the persecution or whatever those enemy nations were trying to afflict on Israel aen had a backup plan he had a costume that he could put on to be identified as is a Babylonian instead of a Christian but you know what his costume religion was costing people their lives his costume Christianity was causing issues in the church and men were losing their lives as a result of this man's hypocrisy until Joshua one day said this ain't right amen this is something has gone wrong in the cap and the Holy Spirit began to discern and achen was exposed as the costume Christian who the god of Israel Jehovah had never become a reality to him and he died as a result of his unbelief I don't want to be a costume Christian this is the deadliest variety of a Christian there is is someone who is putting on a front of Christianity just to impress others Ahab was a costume Christian do you remember Ahab when they were going into battle and I I forget who the other King was I guess it was Jehoshaphat he told Jehoshaphat Jehoshaphat you dress up like the king of Israel and Ahab put on a costume right yeah he disguised himself you read about it in First Kings chapter 22 Ahab disguised himself because he was trying to escape the inevitable result of Prophecy that he would die and the dogs would lick his blood so he set up this scheme and he was propping up Jehoshaphat because he knew the enemy was coming against them and as kings they would be a Target so he was going to let Jehoshaphat go out there with all the kingly garments of an an Israelite King while Ahab himself would disguise himself but brother and sister you can't hide from prophecy it's going to get you and one of those uh enemy uh archers amen recognize there's Ahab and the arrow of Prophecy smoted him between the shoulders and he died in his costume that's right amen prophecy is going to be fulfilled no matter how well the devil tries to disguise himself amen but let me read about yet a third variety of Christian turn with me to Acts chapter 5 verse 17 acts 5:1 17 this then the high priest rose up and all that were with him which is the sect of the Sadducees and were filled with indignation and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison but the angel of the Lord by Night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life and when they heard that they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught but the high priest came and they that were with him and called the council together and all the Senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought but when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and told saying the prison truly found we shut with all safety and the keepers standing without before the doors but when we had opened we found no man Within now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them where unto this would grow then came and told them then came one of and told them saying behold behold the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people right then with the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned and when they had brought them they set them before the council and the high priest and asked them saying did not we straightly command you that you should not teach in this name and behold ye have filled Jerusalem with your Doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us then Peter and the other Apostles answered and said we're sorry come on we're going to retract our statements and and issue an apology we'll even put it in the local paper or on the websites yeah uh-uh right the third variety of Christian I'm going to talk to you about is not a casual Christian is not a costume Christian but they are a Contagious Christian they are more contagious than Co or any other virus anything that Satan has ever put on the earth to try to replicate the thing he fears the most is the Contagious Christian then Peter and the other Apostles answered and said we ought to obey God rather than men the god of our fathers raised up Jesus whom he slew and hanged on the tree him hath God exalted with his his right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his Witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them then stood there up one in the council a Pharisee named Mia a doctor of the law had in reputation among all the people and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space and said unto them ye men of Israel take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men for before these days rose up thius uh theodus boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about 400 joined themselves who was slain and all as many uh as obeyed him were scattered and brought to all and after this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing and Drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many obey as obeyed him were dispersed and now I say unto you refrain from these men these are contagious Christians refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel or this working be of men it will come to not but if it be of God ye cannot overthrow it that's right lest happily you be found even to fight against God right I had a neighbor lady one time when I growing up she had a little fire just over it uh she they lived in a little brick home with a a nice yard and some U I think they had some black walnut or pecan trees out in front of it then there was a driveway and then there was a broom Sage field so she went right across the driveway just over the edge of that broom Sage field and she was just burning some some trash some paper there and a wind came up a wind came up and the next thing you know that fire just began to spread beyond the boundaries of what she had intended for that fire to be and Little Miss Willie Nelson I believe was her name and little miss Nelson was standing out there and uh had a little stick in her hand and you know she stood there and she tried to stomp that fire out which if any of you have ever experienced this understand trying to stomp that fire out is the single worst thing you can do amen because all she did every time she stomped was spread those Sparks a little further every time she stepped and every time she sto sted she just spread the fire a little further next thing you know she realized she had something on her hands that she could not contain amen and by the time she got the phone picked up and the fire department which was hardly a mile down the road the whole field was on fire and was threatened to set the next set of trees the next set of woods on fire I want to say that's what happened on the day of Pentecost every time the devil tried to stamp him out he just spread the fire little fire amen you would think the dumb devil would eventually learn everything he does to attack the move of God only spreads the move of God but when you become a Contagious Christian amen everything that Satan does to try to silence you only spreads The Voice a little bit farther amen so I say stand up speak up amen don't be ashamed to let God use you and to let your life be the very expression of his in this world today today thank you Lord amen being a Contagious Christian in the patmas vision brother benam is talking about the vision that John saw of the seven golden lampstands with Christ in the midst and he said he turned uh he said what is the Candlestick it's a lampstand I'm I'm paraphrasing some of this just to get the essence notice how beautiful when he turned he saw this one like the son of man here standing in the midst see he saw in those lampstands the same one that the Babylonian King saw in the midst of the firing furnace God was right there Amen in the midst of his church amen just like he told Saul why persecutest thou me he was in the midst of that group that Saul was trying to step out and all Saul was doing was spreading the effect of it to the extent where he became a part of it if you can't beat him join him right right amen oh my one like the son of man standing here in the midst of the seven golden l lampstands which means seven Church ages to come each pipe or lampstand hooked into the big man oil sensor this oil came up forth through a little odd-shaped lamp that set with a wick in it and the wick hung down into the oil they poured oil into the top of the St which fill up the big main stem and the big branch and it run out the stems like this and the lamp with the wick hanging down this pipe kept burning day and night you never had to light it it never went out and they just kept pouring oil in the main pipe these lampstands that come out like this had the lamps sitting on top of them the wick from the lamp run down got its life got its life out of here right oh what difference it is from a candle it's a lampstand see a candle's just made of wax and once it burns down that's it but a lampstand is a wick dipped in an Ever renewing supply of oil that's right so it just keeps keeps on burning keeps on giving light because one keeps refilling the source that has creating the light amen now these lampstands the fire that was on these lampstands in the Old Testament when they lit one lamp they could not light the next lamp with the same fire they had in their hand they lit one lamp then picked it up and lit the other lamp and then set it down and lit this lamp and took light and lit this lamp with the same fire they had at the beginning oh I hope it don't go over your head Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the same fire the Holy Ghost lit every one of those churches right down Through the Ages these lampstands all fit into one great big bowl one great big holder and seven different lamp holders come out of it and when they did each one of those lights was drawing from the main resource of its life life and its light was because it had its candle dipped into this main Barrel Oh what a beautiful picture of those Seven Stars it represented that with his life on fire with the Holy Ghost here by faith he's a burning with the Holy Ghost and his life is a candle or not a candle but a wick that's dipped into the Holy Spirit into Christ and through that Wick he's drawing the life of God out to give light to his church amen oh what a picture of the True Believer see he's not just putting the emphasis on the messenger he's saying this typifies the believer amen that's right what kind of a light he's giving the same kind of light that was when the first candle was lit let me just U move down for a sake of time notice they are drawing from this main barrel of oil the life is dipped into Christ you are dead and your life is hid in Christ or hid in God through Christ and sealed by the Holy Spirit there's no way at all to ever get you away from here how can you do it nobody can temper with you the end of your life is burning with the Holy Ghost burning giving light where's the other end of your life dipped into Christ you are dead and hidden in Christ the Holy Ghost is blocking it off there that the devil can't touch you amen right the devil can't touch you thank you Lord he can whiz and make a noise even death itself can't touch you amen amen I I'm I am I won't be too much longer let me read 1 Peter chapter 3 amen 1 Peter chapter 3 you know sometimes we think the real Christians the ones really set setting the fields on fire are the uh the pastors and the evangelists and the missionaries and you know they go out and they take the gospel and the reports come in and uh souls are added to the church but but but that should be contrasted with the individual amen the individual never underestimate God's power to use you as a witness amen when non was healed of leprosy it was the result of one little girl's testimony cor one little girl said there's a prophet right there's a prophet and you he can be healed you you can be healed one little girl's testimony transformed amen a man of great esteem in Syria at the time so here amen I I just want you to say don't I want you to understand don't don't underestimate your witness the the the the the power of God to use you Amen to turn uh uh turn the world upside down amen I mean turn your family turn your community turn your school turn your workplace if you can be a yielded vessel God can use you right here right now amen to turn Satan's kingdom on its head he says here in in 1 Peter chapter 3 likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands you know it's awful to see a wife who listens to everybody else's husband but her own or see a man who's interested in everybody else's Affairs but his own but I'm sorry that was free but he says likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be one but by the conversation of the wives this word conversation is dealing with your conduct your manner of life even when you say nothing your life is speaking things that are having a compelling effect Amen on that husband or wife that's an unbeliever amen yet the Life of Christ through you amen is is is reaching out to bring that companion in to Christ while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plating the hair of wearing of gold see that's a costume Christian they look the part they make great T evangelists right but the world sees that veneer and says if that's Christianity I want nothing to do with it yeah but what wins The Sinner is the reality of Christ's life lived through you and they say that's different than anything I've ever seen on television I want to know where you got that and where I can receive it whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of plating of the hair of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands amen you brother B told the story about the the sister whose husband would go out and Corrals and hang out with his buddies at the bar and the conversation came up one night said there's no real Christians anymore in the world and that man there at the bar with his buddy said Oh yes there is one my wife is a real Christian amen gathered his buddies up they left the bar went to the man's home and you know crashed in through the door there making a big scene making a big Ruckus demanded that she get up and make them some bacon and eggs and threw it on the floor you know the story and instead of the woman reviling in Anger putting them man in this place for his friends she just went back to the stove amen broke some new eggs in the pan must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me she was just living that life she wasn't trying to conquer she wasn't trying to compel she was just letting her little light shine and her life her witness for Christ amen brought conviction down into that cabin amen and that man and his buddy saw a real Christian in action brother and sister that's a Contagious Christian amen that's the kind of Christianity amen it's contagious it spreads like fire from one to another it makes others want what you have found amen Paul and Silas were contagious Christians they threw them in prison one night and instead of them sitting in the corner of that cell feeling sorry for themselves they begin singing praises to the Lord I'm one of them I'm one of them Jesus said count it all joy amen they weren't putting something on hoping God would react they were just doing what they always did they were praising God and brother it made God so pleased amen that he began tapping his foot and like brother bham said Heaven is his throne and Earth is his foot stol brother Bob and when God began patting his foot I believe he told the Angels hey amen take it down a few notches I'm getting a higher Praise You Angels don't know how to worship me like this but those on Earth who are the redeemed Sons and Daughters of God who were bought out of Satan's pawn shop amen and redeemed and filled with my spirit when they begin to worship me it gets my attention amen it brings a reaction they compelled God hallelujah and began tapping his foot and when it began tapping his foot the Earth began to shake the Earth began to tremble the walls of a prison that was designed to Captivate Christians amen shook to the ground Hallelujah God came on the scene to vindicate the testimony of his sons brother they stood there they weren't looking for a release but God gave him a release and God didn't just shake the walls of the prison down he didn't just break the bars but a Philippian Jailer said what must I do to be saved I want the god that you serve amen I
