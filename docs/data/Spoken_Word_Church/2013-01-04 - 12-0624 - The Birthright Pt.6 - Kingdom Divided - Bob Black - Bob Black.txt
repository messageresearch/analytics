========================================

all right we're recording now all systems are good yep just like that all right um go ahead and start turning over in the vicinity of First Kings I'm not sure what the security is just yet but um work today we're going to go through read about the sins of jeroboam and uh talk about your move a little bit uh but before we get started I just to kind of get things moving brother Joe sent me this quote last week Joe candidate and uh this was so good I thought I'd read it I thought this was just really helpful because we all have tension in our lives and things that um seems like why shouldn't things be easier and um so listen to this quote I just want this this helped me the uniting time assigned 1963 brother Ram said speaking of tension I was praying about it this morning that's and that's something interesting me praying about afraid about attention what would you do if you didn't have tint so just think of it tension is part of living that kind of encouraged me when I thought that if you had no tension you'd be like a rag doll you wouldn't have no feelings there be nothing you could work on like a husband and wife maybe if she wants to do something and they're trying to work together especially Christians and the other one won't and when you come together to find out what she's doing she finds out I see the tension really brings you closer together somebody tells you that well said just think of the little wife that went under a lot of tension when you wasn't so good or the husband went into her some tension when he wasn't so good then when it's all forgiven look how you feel about it see you've got to have tension that's all he said some people trying to introduce introduce Christianity that you're free from worry or no you're not you're free from hitching oh no you had attention when you become a Christian because he was kind of a sloth you were happy to go lucky whatever was out there not caring what you did like when you become a real Christian every moment you're wondering am I pleasing my Lord if I could hear from him it puts you on tension puts you on heart so attention what's this tension if I could have been born without this tension well if I wouldn't have had this tension I wouldn't have been what I am I wouldn't have been a I wouldn't have been a Christian perhaps it was this tension that drove me to Jesus Christ see so it's been a blessing thing to me so next time you get a little attention in your life thank the Lord because he's helping you a long life away right so um last time that is in United time United Thomas 1963 . so we were going through the genealogy and um we talked uh previously about how this song that uh the lineage was split with Solomon um and Judah brings forth Christ from Korea mold and Ephraim represents the many nations the birthright blessing of many nations and um through care level and start off with durable through Israel they went off into captivity and Assyria and then Judah went off into captivity in Babylon and returned after 70 years but the Israel is is was continue to be lost until they began to return to their Homeland but let's um we just reviewed what uh remember the promise to Abraham in Genesis 17 was that for me behold my Covenant is with thee and I shall be a father of many nations neither shout thy name any more we call Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I mean and then it's promised to Jacob and Genesis 35 and God said unto him I am God Almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of Nations shall be of thee and Kings shall come out of thou wounds and then the promise to Ephraim through Jacob when he was blessing and from Manasseh Injustice 48 19 and his father refused and said I know it my son I know it this is Abraham talking he also shall become a people and he's also shall be created but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of Nations and then uh in first Chronicles 5 1. now the sons of Reuben was the firstborn of Israel for he was the first one for for as much as he defiled his father's bed his Birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel and the genealogy is not to be recognized after the birthright so remember in Matthew Lou you've got a genealogy through Judah and Matthew and Luke deviates it uh actually I saw him Solomon and uh the birthright doesn't have any kind of genealogy and let's go on to uh I said let's start reading in First Kings let's actually start reading uh keep kind of keep a placeholder on First Kings let's go over to Exodus 13. so now let's read the story of the uh the the ride of the firstborn in Exodus 13 was to be redeemed Christ and so it's kind of thinking of the median Nation if you've got the um the firstborn mule that's us makes just 13 verse 12 through 15. let's actually started over Saloon and it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the Canaan Isis he swear unto thee and to thy father and so give it thee that thou shalt sit apart unto the Lord all that open up the Matrix and every person they cometh up a beast which thou Hast the male shall be the Lords and every first lamb and asks this Thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou will not redeem it then Thou shalt break his neck and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come say what is this but Thou shalt say unto him by strength of him the Lord brought us out of out from Egypt from the house of bondage and it came to pass when Pharaoh would hardly let us go that the Lord slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of Beast therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all that open up the Matrix being males but all the firstborn of my children I redeemed and it shall be a token upon thine hand and for frontless between Thine Eyes For by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt so there this is to be remembrance of what happened in Egypt where they had the blood over the door on the littles of the doorpost to remind them that you remember think about how when they were in Egypt the the Angels coming through to take the firstborn and their the firstborn is wondering am I going to be uh am I safe and step outside and look at the um the blood over the door now Us in the many nations were wondering are am I how can I do anything I don't have a genealogy or anything how can I be safe but we're safe in Christ laughs so brother Brandon in the unconditional Covenant that God made with the people in 1954 he said I hear so many now my Armenian brother and I don't aim to rub this in but this may pinch just a little bit but I love you see all right notice now not nothing you can do you might live good all your life and you go to hell it's by the grace of God that you're saving that's right what God has did for you notice the law of redemption the innocent for the guilty what if a little back under the laws of redemption what if a little old cult was born some night a little mule and that little meal was born with both ears hanging down now if anybody knows anything about mules that's an awful mule a mule with his ears hanging down he's no good and he's cross-eyed he's not need his tail sticks right up what a horrible looking creature that poured along you would look in a mirror and had an intelligence he'd say oh my wait till they come out and see me I haven't even got a chance look what a horrible looking thing I am but if his name he knows anything about Redemption she's saying wait a minute honey you fail to understand they're not going to kill you amen they're not even going to even look at you now that's that's the key part it's not even going to even look at you right but you are born with a Birthright and that's the birthright right the birthright is that you you have a review that they're not even going to look at you they're going to look at you in Christ with blood over the little of the door of your heart and lower Grace he said I remember a little story I don't know whether I ever told you or not it's just a little fiction story all right under the law of the old mother horse had a little cold and it was a new you know and his ears broke down his knees knocked and oh what a cross-eyed horrible looking you for that mule if he could look at himself and say oh my when the master comes out he'll kill me because he wouldn't feed me I'm not worthy to live look at me with a horrible looking mess I am but if the mother could speak back a little fella she'd say wait a minute honey you can live because you're my first you have a Birthright now when the master comes out and sees you in all your condition he has to go back and get a lamb without a blemish on it and kill it so that that crippled up looking mule could live you see the priests never seen a mule he saw the lamb it wasn't whether the meal was perfect had to be the perfect lamb and when you think about the prom the birthright promises through Abraham it's kind of confusing because you uh you kind of tend to see just the lineage of Christ this is the Redeemer the birthright promises our our right to be redeemed because he paid the price not not all but based on our Perfection but from his profession and I just have this quote in here about on conferences in the sermon conferences 1963 wrote around said if God judges the World by the Catholic Church the Protestant is lost he joins it by the Protestants which one he judged by the Catholic Church there's many different fears of the Spheres the Catholic church so which one is it going to be you see a person will be confused you wouldn't know what to do but here's what God was judging by the word that's the standard heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never never fail upon this I take my stand all of the grounds to seeking sand all of the grounds of sinking sand on Christ the solid rock I stand I'm depending on it I'm not trusting in what I am I'm trusting what he is I cannot I cannot go to heaven Jesus said I had to be perfect to get there to be there for perfect even as your father in Heaven how can you be when you got look not at you but at your sacrifice so now let's I'll just read first Chronicles 5 2. actually I already talked about that how the birthright the genealogy is not wrecking after the birthright and then um in Genesis 48 it talks about how that Birthright was uh given to the younger Ephraim over Manasseh and Ephraim so you got Manassas should have had the birthright the law but instead of Vanessa went to the younger they're from actually terrible almost descended from everyone who is Christ because we're not saved by the law we're saying by improvised and uh that's what brother Brown said in the countdown 1964. so um now let's look at the Kingdom being divided the kingdom was actually divided really quickly right after Saul's death when uh Saul's son Easter Chef would rule over Israel Abner actually set him up said I'm going to make it yourself to the ruler and then uh David got Judah and then later on Abner came over to David's side and David became ruler over all Israel and Judah together and then uh in First Kings I'll just read where uh the the reason why uh the kingdom was split because of what Solomon did in First Kings 11. First Kings 11 verse 11 through 13. wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon for as much as this is done of thee announced not kept my Covenant and my statutes which I can which I've commanded Thee I was surely we're in the Kingdom from thee give it to thy servant notwithstanding in the days will not do it for David thy servant thy father say but I will Rend it out of the end of thy son how be it I will not run away all the kingdom but we'll give one tribe that thy son or David my servant sake for Jerusalem sake which I have chosen and um second chronicles 11 tells the story of the division of the two kingdoms how that uh durable I mean readable Solomon remember Solomon had put in heavy taxes to build the temple and rebound and said well I'm going to continue those taxes and make them even worse and the people revolvered and went after Dearborn but remember last time we were talking about how the the genes of God God flips on the little attributes and manifests his word in us and his great plan and you can see that and every uh we got due to an Ephraim are kind of the main players but all the 12 tribes had a part to play and uh manifesting Christ and manifesting his word ah so this is all just part of God's plan it's part of his predestinated plan to bring about his word um and Jeremiah 33 it talked about the two families that God has chosen which is uh so you got it and set that up and from velocity okay so the next thing I want to talk about without your April is it can be a little confusing when you read the scripture that um did I get it right no I was just saying there was a player on the on the board okay and I couldn't associate um as you read this from this uh the many nations are to go by many names from Israel Samaria and it can be a little huge it just keep track of everything just cause the terminology but um the reason uh so Samaria was actually the capital of Israel Israel the Jerusalem was the capital of was the capital of Judah and then uh Samaria was the capital of Israel and the reason we know that is because just a little history on that jeroboa rain and Chico and then later on they show I moved in capital to tearsome and then zimmery uh reigned for seven days and burned the King's death house down on his own head and then Armory bought a hill from Shamar and built the city of Samaria so that's how Samaria ended up being the capital of Israel and uh brother Burnham said the way of a true prophet of God in 1962 and Samaria was the Capital One of the capitals at the time of the reign of jeroboil and it kind of helps when you're looking at scriptures like hope and Isaiah where he said um thy Castle Samaria has to cast they offer my anger is kennel against thee against them how long will it be here they attended nscc and Jose 7 1 when I would have healed Israel then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered in the wickedness of Samaria for they commit falsehood and the thief coming in coming in and the troop of robber spoiled it without all these names refer to um for the same thing and now let's kind of follow um the story of Dearborn because this is very interesting let's look at First Kings chapter 12. see what Dearborn is and why it was so bad you know we know terrible set up the golden calves and Bethlehem but it really had a lasting impact on all of Israel so First Kings chapter 12 26 through 30. actually it started verse 28 6 and durable and send in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the House of David if his people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord Jerusalem they show the heart of this people turning into under their lord even into rehabolism and they shall kill me and go again to re-evolt them here we're pulling the king to council to make two calves of gold instead of them and it's too much for you to go up to Jerusalem Behold thy God the bill of Israel which brought me up out of the land of Egypt and he said the one in Bethel and the other putty and Dan and this thing became a sin for the people who went to worship before the one even a sedan and he made an House of high places and made Creeks of the lowest of the people which were not of the sons of Levi and terrible more than the feast in the eight month and goes on so that what garibald did was he set up the two golden calves see later on what the Kings after him did so let's turn to First Kings 15. 26 the next one in line after him kind of kind of go down all through all the kings of Israel and see if they ever departed from his way or chapter 15 verse 26 nadab the son of terrible and began ran over Israel in the second year basic king of Judah and regular original two years and he did evil in the side of the Lord and walked in the way of his father and in his sin we're in where with you made Israel to sin so he walked he stayed in the Sands of Dearborn quite happy let's go to bayesia First Kings 15 34. down the page when Basia did evil in the side of the Lord and walked in the way of dear evolvement in his scene where with he made Israel to say and then let's go to Eli who reigned for two years First Kings 16 13. for all the sins of baisha and the sins of Eli his son by which they sent him by which they made Israel sin provoking the Lord God of Israel to anger with their amenities see sorry we know 15 13. I'm written down a wrong scripture verse 15 says okay so uh Eli continued on the sense of Dearborn and then uh please yeah for all the sins of baisha and the sins of Eli so so he didn't apart from the sins of his father and then first King 16 18. and they came to pass when zimmery saw that the city was taken said he went into the promise of the King's house and burnt the King's house over him with fire and died for his sins what she sinned and doing evil on the side of the Lord and walking in the way of jeroboam and seeing what you did to make Israel to sin so he didn't perform either even though he only ran one week kind of just for Armory uh in first king 16.5 uh go down a few verses Omri raw evil in the eyes of the Lord and didn't worse than all that were beforehand before he walked in all the way up terrible the sun will be back in an innocent where with he made Israel's sins and wrote The Lord God of Israel to anger when they're abandons and I'm going to skip forward let's go to Second Kings chapter 10. it actually repeats each King it says you did worse and all that were for him or plead them to the sins of jeroboa um Yahoo and second Kings 10 29. now this is peculiar because you would think you know after remember yay Who tricked out all the beow worshipers into coming to the house of Baal and they flew them all once they had he said if you worship Bell everybody come that works for today all the priests everybody come to the house of hell and they all gathered they tricked them they said I'll kill them all I killed him he killed everybody so you think okay well yay finally we got a king that departed from says gerbola let's see um what it says about him chapter 10 verse 29. I'll be it from the sins of jeribo and the son of anybody who made Israel to San Diego who departed not from after them to win the golden calves that were in Bethlehem that were in Dan so he did a good job getting rid of all the priests and everything but he still left the golden calves that caused Israel to sin I remember during all this time of Israel uh you got prophets like uh Elijah that was sent to the Israelite prophets of Baal and so and they and the children of Israel said the Lord he is God after they saw what God had hit how he consumed the ultimate fire but they still there's two golden calves in Bethlehem Dam caused Israel to depart from the ways of God and then uh Jehovah has followed the sins of jeroboam joash and second Kings 13 11 departed not from all the sins of jeroboam jeroboam II in Second Kings 14 24. and he did that which was evil in the size of the Lord he departed not from all the sins of durable and the son of Nevada who made Israel to sing Zachariah Second Kings 15 9 departed not from the sins of jeroboa shallow Marine one month and nothing was reported about his sins that's the only one that did not that it doesn't say what his sins were and then uh now the interesting thing about this the dynasties of Israel is well for you you don't have anybody that is it continues from um father to son father son all the way down uh Efron it's broken up into eight dynasties so somebody would come along and uh if you don't want if the current king and the David Kim the king and then for a couple of years and then they would uh when they would get killed or after a few Generations I'm just doing a little history lesson um I'll show you the last king he reigned for 20 years 20 years and what the Bible says about him in Second Kings 17 2 he did that which was evil but not as the Kings of Israel that were before him but um Jose uh paid tribute to uh shamanice or the fifth of Assyria and he stopped famous because he was expecting the king of Egypt so to come to his Aid well somebody's going to come help me so so uh didn't the salmon this or arrested her saying late Seas just some area and then the city fell but shamanisser died so the armies of Assyria were recalled to ensure the succession of Sargon II and uh later on Sargon returned in the port of the citizens of Israel beyond the Euphrates and settled others in their place now this is kind of apparently important because this this is the history of Samaria that this is why the Jews uh especially during the time of Christ hated the Samaritans so much that's why I kind of one of the reasons why the Good Samaritan is if you kind of understand it from this perspective it's so important that you know there's the Levi and that all the people that you thought would be good that would help this person but somebody that that's used despised from Samaria would help let's turn into second Kings chapter 17 and just kind of look at the history of Samaria chapter 17 verse 6. in the ninth year of Hosea the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away into a Syria and placed them in Holland in apple or by the river of dozen in this in the city of the medes I'm going to read down to verse 24 birthday or so it was the two individual had sinned against the Lord Our God which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt and had feared other gods and walked in the statues of the Heathen in the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel now the Kings of Israel which they had made and the children of Israel did secretly those things but they were not right against the Lord their God and they built Empire places in all their cities from the Tower of the watch went to the fence City and they set them up images and grooves and every high heel and under every Green Tree and there they burn incense and all the high places carried away before they've been raw wicked things to provoke the Lord to anger for they served Idols where the old and said unto them ye shall not do this thing yet the Lord testified against Israel and against you about all the prophets Allah Allah are saying turning from your evil ways keep my Commandments and my statutes according to all the Lords I commanded your fathers which I sent to you by my service the prophets I was standing they were not here but hardened their necks like to the nick of their fathers that did not believe in the Lord their God and they rejected his statutes and his Covenant that he made with their fathers and his testimonies when she testified against them and they followed vanity and became Vain and went after the Heathen that were round about they're concerning him the Lord had charged them that they should not do like them and they left all the Commandments of the Lord their God and made them molten images even two cows and made a Grove and worshiped all Oaks of heaven and served Baal and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire and his divination and enchantments and sold themselves to do evil on the side of the Lord to provoke him to anger therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed him out of his sight there was none left but the tribe of Judah only also Judah kept not the Commandments of the Lord their God would walk in the statues of Israel which they made and the Lord rejected all the seed original and afflict them and deliver them into the hand of spoilers until he had cast him out of his sight for he ran Israel from the House of David and they made terrible and the son of anus and they were at King and jeroboam dream Israel from following the Lord and made them sin a great sin for the children of Israel wants and all the sins of jeroboam which he did that departed not from them until the Lord removed Israel out of his sightings he has set by all his servants the prophets so was Israel carried away out of their own land to Syria unto this day and the king of Syria brought me in from Babylon from Cutlery from Iowa and from home office from Sephora fighting and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel and they possessed some area I dwell in the cities thereof so that's the last verse that's kind of tells the history of how they were sent off into Assyria and the last verse says so they it took Israel sent them off to a Syria and then the kingdom of Syria took men from Babylon and from all these places that were not Jews and placed them into the land of Assyria so now going forward in Samaria you've got a bunch of people that really don't have a genealogy they're from all over and they start reading with the uh the ones that are left over Judah and uh uh later on they cause cause problems with uh the when they come back to rebuild the Temple of the an army of Sumerians you think they're the original Sumerians but they're not they're this mixed uh bunch of uh people that don't have really have any they didn't have any place being there to begin with and um it's interesting if you look in the New Testament all the Samaritans it's uh Jesus used there was a lot of Samaritans that dealt with Jesus like the story of the Good Samaritan and um believe the woman at the Wells from Samaria um anyway that's uh let's go ahead and stop right there building very easy
