========================================

no headset so don't be uh don't be alarmed but they're trying to get the computer fixed so we can pipe the voice in Revelations chapter 6 now we're still studying on the first seal all right I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals heard as it were the noise of Thunder what brother R say thunder was was the voice of God when seal break one of the four beasts says come and see now we're going to get into that a little bit later who was one of those beasts it was the lion cuz the lion was the one that went out first it's lion ox man and Eagle right so the lion roared said come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth con conquering and to conquer which was not just conquering at that moment but to conquer he has continued to conquer so that when that seal open brother Rand said when the seal opens what happens a war breaks out a spiritual war a plague falls on the people they become spiritually dead then there's a Warfare between the live Christian and the and the live devil because the Power of Choice The Power of Choice there's your Battleground where does that come from right here right here your choice oh choose you this day Moses said Joshua said who you were serve but Power was given assemble his horse you're going to see this horse all the way through cuz a horse represents the power all right and behind you of course it's all covered up we may bring it out here next Sunday but um it shows the four horse riders in that drawing that the brother from Brother Ronnie did from the philippins but you got a man on a horse a horse is a power now who gives the who gives a man setting on him the power the horse does the horse is the power the horse power that drives okay but the guy sitting on the horse had a bow and no arrows and the crown was given him by who the people all right so let's go back to Matthew 24 just read a few scriptures and then we'll comment Matthew 24 cuz we got to set this basis to get into this seal because we're going to look at the natural part of of it spiritual part of it and then what's going to happen later on right verse 5 245 for many shall come in my name and say I am Christ and shall deceive many all right you got a man sitting on a white horse this guy has a bow which to me that would show that even brother Bram in his early Ministry was was showing that that was the Holy Ghost because he had a bow and he had a crown so this was an important person it wasn't just somebody that was sitting on a horse that looked dead no he probably had that bow and he was he threw that bow out like this you know but the mystery was there was no arrows there all right there was nothing to give this man but he had a bow and he had a crown right he looked kind of prestigious all right that's what happened in the first church age brother Rand said all the back there in NAA and places like that there was uh a group of aristocrats got in all right so this is just a common part that happened on the earth during the time of the first church age cuz really the first church age is when this white horse rider began to ride out now let's read in in second Thessalonians 2 now this is Paul in ad 54 so from ad30 when Jesus spoke these words in Matthew let's just get ad33 cuz it was right at the end of his ministry ad33 watch what happened verse three let's just let's just read the whole 2 Thessalonians not first 2 Thessalonians 2 now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him of course that's the song We Sing We Are gather Gathering Together unto him that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled now what's he telling he's telling you what he telling you there's something coming there's a problem coming here so don't be shaken troubled neither by Spirit or by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand is at hand I thought the day of Christ was before Paul came you understand what I'm saying all right the day of Christ no but computer's doing something over here but the day of Christ he says is at hand which is when now all right let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin and be revealed the son of predition now let's just look at what starting here in a baby form it's people getting in the church um I see us coming up in about 2 or 300 years cuz you know 300 is when they had the first Nan Council but Paul could see that man of sin already start cuz remember when Jesus came back on the day of Pentecost and 8033 the devil came right with him and got on that horse and started riding okay Satan's pretty quick remember he's like he's just he's like the light he's not light but he's like the light I mean he's fast he's quick excuse me for that day shall not come except to come A Falling Away first okay Falling Away first which was what I know I'm walking out of the camera but in that fourth what happened if you look at your church ages there was a great falling away in the natural sense but it's also the spiritual sense but now there is a great Falling Away Now spiritually which is way worse than naturally John Paul was not talking about a natural Falling Away look churches even message churches are getting so big they're getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger but there's supposed to be a great Falling Away maybe it's not in numbers but in people that are really born again right sorry who opposes and exalted let's go back for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition how I wrote in my Bible how by this message right the message is the only time that the son of predition can really be like like we're going to read in the fourth seal he finally gets a name his name was death right here but the symbol was that he was hidden behind a white righteous church right but in that fourth seal when that man begins to ride out that Pale Horse the Bible says Called Death give him a name okay well Paul's giving him a name here but that's a mystery because look who opposes and exalteth him exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God as God not light now he you know he wants to be life Christ in the Old Testament this is setting as God sth in the temple of God Church churches buildings people showing himself that he is God not want to be right here is the effect of all this other that's been that's been going through remember you not that when I was yet with you I told you these things that was ad 54 one of the most powerful ages that ever was the Ephesian Church remember Ephesus and us are supposed to be the two book ends the we're supposed to get back to that right we're supposed to be just like they were in the first age and then these seals are to open to show us exactly what's going on okay but we're supposed to get back to where Paul was standing which was at the faith of the fathers up there with all the virtues working right remember you not that when I was yet with you I told you these things and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity do all ready work now we were talking about this brother Jim Pinkston and I and listen to this only a prophet could break this down only a prophet only a word Prophet could break this down because you not going to read it like this for the mystery of all right we're going to read this without Revelation for the mystery of iniquity that already work on only he who now leth will let until he be taken out of the way now to you and I to me and people that read that you can put the Satan you put Satan in there cuz he's going to be taken out of the way but you come with brother Brandon brother brandham reads it like this only he God who now lth will let in other words he's letting things go until he the prophet said the bride but you got to remember one thing he said now now she is him cuz that don't say she that says he right he right brother Brown said that's the bride Christ he said that's the bride until he be taken out of the way in other words he's going to let this thing go on God is until he the bride the the real church I don't even want to say church anymore it's bride wife has been taken out of the way but see she is him right so now we can say we are what's the same scripture that speaks of the what bridegroom speaks of the Bride so she is him so brother brandham could as a prophet could tell us these things and sometimes we probably scratch our head wondering why but I can see now that's how that fits in here and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth if you want to know what page that page 116 of the seal book is when he said he who leth will let until he be taken away we'll read it in just a minute and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming all right cuz he's going to consume him with the spirit of his mouth the word all right bride is the final voice to the final a cuz Paul is saying a great fall of the Way's got to come and that man of sin will be revealed and man of sin was never revealed until that Prophet opened that first seal and showed that that white horse rider was the Antichrist riding through the church even him verse five whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God shall send them who the church nominal Message Church strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness but now watch Paul but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth so there is somebody that's going to believe that truth and I believe they're here on the earth now all right let's go to 116 let's read that if you don't have your if you don't have one like this one it'll be paragraph 85 of the first seal I have a question M that we question I had the same question where are we at verse eight the wicked but in scoffield the original says the Lawless one I don't know Satan's always Capital he's like God Satan the s in Satan is capital I wouldn't put him in their Capital at all but let me tell you something though we're forgetting we're forgetting what we're doing here that's right Satan is the number two man he is the most religious person besides God we think he's the most in the opposite direction well yeah he is but he's right there with God just like this except for in creation let me tell you something what I think about this this is just my opinion you know the reason that that God lets Satan continue and do the things he does you think if if I was God and I saw Satan and I knew it before I even made him he was going to do this I never made him right but to fulfill the plan cuz you and I were inside of God the only way to get us out and what is God doing now because remember in a mouth of two or three Witnesses let everything be established remember God cannot cannot make a law and not abide by it by himself he can't say all right in mouth two or three Witnesses let everything be established and then him not do that all right now when God condemns Satan at the end when everything becomes natural when I'm when I say natural when this the whole scene plays out we know in God's mind it's already played out but it's going to there is going to be a white Throne judgment there is going to be a playing out of this scene where we stand in judgment with Jesus Christ as almighty God and the people come before and actually Satan is destroyed before them brother Bown said the Holy Ghost is a gentleman right very timy but in the mouth of two or three Witnesses God is proving to Satan me and you thr the mouth of trly witnesses he's going to have Satan is going to have to witness and so are you right and God's already see in God's mind is already done so so but he's got to have some witnesses what he's doing now is he's showing Satan that he's God God is God right he's proving to Satan because he thought so much of that man that he made what about Adam why didn't you if we were God why didn't we just say okay Adam you you you boooo I'll just do away with you and I'll do away with Eve and I'll just make me some more kids that are better than you are no God can't do that that's right he's got to have a witness you and I are going to be the witness to Satan that God can live in human flesh just like he wanted to to start with and make it and make it by what not by God putting you in a tube and pulling you through saying okay lisadell you you made it because of me no you made it because of you so you can tell Satan then Satan I made a choice I am a witness that God can can live like he wanted to live in human flesh I am that witness and you know what that's what's going to condemn Satan right because we destroy him you didn't read that we destroy him with the with the power of the mouth right right here Spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming where is the coming of Jesus Christ in the people physically he's not going to come onto this Earth Earth until what the Millennium so what's he doing he's proving to Satan that somebody can make this thing right here pointing to the Bible stay alive in flesh like that brother was preaching Wednesday night which was really good it was the flesh God in flesh flesh human flesh right here this flesh not another the way I see it too the natural typing the spiritual a man want a white that wants him oh absolutely no doubt that's the choice not because she has to because she wants him and Satan standing you know threes a crowd but Satan's standing there and you're going to be the witness that's just the way I believe it you think well it's got all this you know you put Theology and all this and you put the bible let me just put it in a in a simple form God created Satan Satan made a choice but God created Satan to be the anointed one to help him in all the things that he done and he turned him down Satan says okay there's no way I can create he's smart enough to know that he can't create but once God creates something then Satan can come and pervert it so that's what he's been doing he's just pervert it he saw God make an eternal word he was standing there the prophet said when he said let there be let there be let there be that's why he knew the principles of life cuz he said let the fish and the foul multiply and replenish the Earth where Satan knew he didn't have a seed himself so he perverted the the Beast seed got into the Beast and what the Beast was just doing something natural but he motivated that Beast to do what he did with Eve and the seed would mingle and then what did God do he separated all that that didn't separate Satan cuz Satan stayed right there beside of him but God is proving this is the witness two or three mouth of two or three so it's going to be you and the devil the devil's going to have to witness one day cuz the Bible says every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess Satan one day when we all stand and we all take a body change see that's that's something we were talking about this weekend we're talking about God in flesh Satan when we get finished with these seals when we get down to that four seal that's an incarnate devil there is a man standing on the earth I want you to keep this in back of your mind Sister Barbara had her hand up and I'm going to try to hurry and get her get her question keep this in in mind that is what you and I are here for we're here to prove to Satan that God's going to do what he done right and that God will incarnate himself not just take June Dale or Peggy Dale or whoever and just say well I'm going to do no he's going to he's going to totally consume that being and then this will be the Flesh of God Satan don't know how to do that right Satan is a copycat remember because he's incarnate after we leave brother brandham said what we go up right up through the ceiling prob probably say something about the devil knocking on the door down anyway all right when he when we go up what happens Satan comes down and incarnates a pope and he is is Incarnate Satan on the face of this Earth he is the most evil person God sorry Satan has finally got what he wanted he wanted to indwell human flesh but he can't do it because this right here has not been totally revealed once this word has been totally revealed in a group of human beings and they one thing left people and that's death that's the only thing we can we lack destroying and that's death death is Satan's little trunk card but even when Jesus died people continue to keep dying but the ones that died in the faith God's going to raise back up Satan's waiting for that to happen when he sees that happen he'll say aha I know how to do it now and he comes right down into a pope and becomes a very religious highly right there where it says says as God he will be he it himself showing himself that he is God that's right because remember now even the pope when when they uh whatever they do to a PO one dies and the other one comes in and God incarnates that man they say God comes down and incarnates that man so they're close to it now but when they get Satan Superman that's when Satan's going to come right in and incarnate that man and he's going to rule the world with an iron fish and we're not going to be here sister Barber what say it's pretty much I love but you're just thought that Wicked one was the Antichrist because he was sitting inle as God and exactly even in the Bible one of the whole this whole few minutes were to show you that even the Bible even I'm going to say this let me step out on the Lim because God honor Satan if he didn't he'd destroy him if he didn't he would let him get close to it right now would you not you know God's not sitting up there thinking you know well he knows what the guy's doing and going to do and the whole plan but God is honoring that man cuz God created and now how would be like me and and and Donnie you know I thought enough of him to bring him adopt him into my family and give him part of a business you know and then one day say no you're not worth it no he brought Satan into his economy cuz Satan was not Satan remember he was the anointed chff he was a worship Angel he became Satan when all that junk that he did Happ okay so let's don't look at Satan as being so far away and being something so evil and hideous now we know he is he's the creator of evil he don't create but he is the perverter of good which makes it evil see brother brandham even the little things he would tell us he'd say he'd say okay he said now you and you and your wife you have relations under under the the umbrella of the wedding there's no problem God said bed not be defiled everything's honorable but you do that with somebody else's wife see now what have you done you still male and female still male and female still two people doing the same thing that you and your wife did it's just out from under a law the law of God or the law of even principle of a human being God didn't want that to happen I've said many times God didn't want divorce to happen because he knew not only that it's scripturally wrong but he knew we couldn't handle it you look at split marriages and see I don't care if you have even a very amicable one there's something in there that just gnaws at you all the time ain't that the truth ain't that the truth ain't that the truth and all of us have not don't matter if we're married two or three times if we've done everything anything outside of marriage we're we're guilty so yes ma'am has Satan ever incarnated a very evil man in the world like Hitler at the time he was he just anoints okay he just anoints he will not be incarnated until this right here cuz brother R said he incarnates a pope he becomes the Satan incarnate Satan Superman now we think he's Satan Superman now which he is which is developing into that all right but he's not the one he's not what Satan wants yet right you know why cuz you and I are still here that's right see people that's what I'm saying we are the witness we're the witness that God we God is protecting us look read that again for the mystery of iniquity does already work so it's already working y it's already infiltrating itself until only he God who now leth will let he's letting it happen he's letting Satan have his way have his why for a witness cuz one day he's going to say Satan these people is what I wanted these are the ones I wanted the ones that take a body chain he can point right at them and say look at there they destroyed you standing in human flesh right you have absolutely destroyed every effect there's only one power Satan has over us right now and that's us getting older sure he can play with your mind and he can he can affect your choices in on a daily basis and we may sin and do things wrong but I'm not talking about big sin I'm well Sin is Sin but I'm talking about we don't go out smoke gamble drink and cuss and do those things I hope not all right but we do have bad thoughts wrong thoughts and stuff like that and we do sometimes get a little ill and agitated and all things like that but you know what that's motivated by Satan but as far as incarnate someone he'll incarnate at the end when he gets in he cannot incarnate until God shows himself incarnated in human flesh FL you and I Believers that's we so bad CR The Rock we had done that yet that's right when he gets in the car he's going to do some horrible things because remember Bible says CR the rocks to fall on see this is all under the first seal think about what's going on going to what think about what was released after this seal open okay this is this is awful enough on the bad side but on the good side we're going to get to where you and I and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and I wrote bride final Voice final age in my Bible with the brightness of his coming now if you'll go back in the Old Testament remember in the Old Testament God promised that the light of the Moon would be seven times brighter in the end time that who's the moon the moon's always the bright remember the sun is the sun is the bride the Moon is the bridegroom I mean the bridegroom is the sun and the bride is the moon right the Lesser light but in the end time that lesser light will be so bright seven times brighter than the sun we may pick that up it's in Isaiah somewhere let's read it we got time I'll find it cuz I got it marked in my Bible somebody find it that's why I like to go back we'll go back 30 H 30 26 there you go got it right here all right this scripture was the one that was that we read there for 911 too remember 25 and there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every high hills rivers and streams of water in the day of the great Slaughter when the towers fall moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun coming up to something and the light of the sun shall be Sevenfold now the light of the sun's going to be seven times prior because the son of man's going to be here right in as a light of seven days and the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people and health The Stroke of their wound what's our wound death that's the only thing that can harm us people death right you said well all cancer no what is cancer go to death right death is the main man that we have not been able to handle we can't get a grasp on death somebody just as powerful look like look at um um Paul Anderson up here strongest man in the world one little bitty germ in his kidney killed it one little germ powerful man went down just months he died went down to nothing why well little joury that that little germ was death that's way to go to went to death but now natural death is not what we're worried about in the end time it's spiritual death the prophet says which is millions times worse is to be walking remember they were walking around alive remember it talks about the woman she's dead while she liveth that's the church woman's always a type of the church she's dead while she's alive right all these glamour Queens and stuff you think boy they look so good and they're so no they're dead they're death walking and they'll take you to death too moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the sun's going to be seven times brighter so guess what's going to happen to the moon the M the moon and the brightness of his coming all right let's read this right here before we stop let's let the prophet tell paragraph 85 he gets finished reading that in 2 Thessalonians he says I was writing this down quivering and shaking this in paragraph 84 the mystery of iniquity do already work only he who leth will let until he be taken out of the way who he that leth see a mystery everybody got this paragraph 85 who got it yes he who he that L it see a mystery the mystery of iniquity way back in that very first church age here here is Paul writing saying that the mystery of iniquity what is Iniquity iniquity is something that you know you ought not to do and you do it anyway and Paul said there is such in the early today in the Earth today workers of iniquity oh if you were going to get to the let's just read that piece just a minute start up a little further third verse let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that he spells it out m a n man it's not a spirit it's a man of sin be revealed the son of predition that's right who opposes and exalted himself above all that's called God or that is worship so that he as God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God and brother Brandon quotes remitting sins remember you not that when I was yet with you I told you these things I'd like to have sit under some of his teaching wouldn't you and now you know that with that know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time what with holding Paul was saying what was withholding was the mystery of that man iniquity until what until what withholding withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time what's his time now everything's point you keep reading this seal book you going to see everything's pointing to these this people right here not the people sitting listening in Jeffersonville in 1963 everything in this book is pointing to people that are sitting here right now that's right this age right now then see not then but in his time you see there brother R said not then not during Paul's age but in his time see at the breaking of that seal we'd know exactly what it was who is this man of iniquity who is this man of sin this fellow that's working iniquity but he be revealed in his time now he reads it again listen how he reads it for the mystery of iniquity does already work deceivers you see deceiving the people often to something only he God that lth will let until he the church Christ the bride be taken out of the way and then shall the wicked one be revealed at the breaking of the seal at his time Paul said not in my time but in the time that he'll be revealed when the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth we going to get that after a while the spirit of his mouth Watch what it is and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him Who coming is after the workings of Satan him him a man whose working is after the working of Satan with all power and lying wonders and with all deceivable deceivableness of unrighteousness deceiving people by unrighteousness and them that perish not this bride in them that's looking for such a thing because they receive not the love of the truth and didn't say they didn't receive the truth remember what somebody was preaching the other day about love brother Pinkston on Friday night about love and love and the Caps don't ain't because you just darely love everybody and you don't want to you know hug and kiss them all and you think they're all so wonderful that's not that kind of love that Love's corrective if God didn't love us and let a little things happen to us then e what he said we' Bast your children right see right but they receive not the love and I underline that because that's the big deal they did not it didn't say they didn't receive the truth now did it it said it didn't receive the love of the truth and that love there I don't believe is the love like you have for your wife that's agape love that is the love of almighty God and Christ is a truth and Christ is a word but they would rather have a Creed huh that they might be saved and for this cause God has sent them strong delusion that they should believe a a lie should be translated there as I looked in the Lexicon the lie not a li the LIE the same one he told Eve that they might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness what a statement my after the bride is taken away then this man of sin will reveal himself all right we'll have to stop right there because we're out of time but the man of sin don't you believe he's not here because he's come right here to find his Incarnation he's come to this message right here he was standing there that day the prophet broke those seals and he was standing there in a group of people that refuted everything brother brandham said brother brand said he said it's not for you people he said it for another grouth
