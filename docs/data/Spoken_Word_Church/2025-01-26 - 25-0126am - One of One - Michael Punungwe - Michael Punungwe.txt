amen good morning Saints God bless you all it's good to be in the house of the Lord give your Bibles we'll turn to John chapter 4 amen just go to the Lord in a word of prayer father Lord we thank you for this this morning Lord we can all gather together Lord and just search for truth Lord and search for clarity in your word Lord just get any man any person out the way Lord that you can minister to your people when needs to be said just pray for all the needs Lord and and that they all be answered Lord and you'll take care of everyone that that's hurting or need something from you today and just thank you for every blessing Lord that we don't forget what you've done for us already Lord continue to lead us and guide us in this day Lord and give us Clarity on your word in your PR name of Jesus Christ I pray amen amen amen John chapter 4 starting at verse 4 and he and he must needs go through Samaria then cometh he to a city of Samaria which is called s SAR near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph now Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey s sat thus on the well and it was about the 6th hour there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus saith unto her give me to drink for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy meat then saith the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew askest drink of me which I'm a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given the Living Water I pray today we have the revelation of the gift of God and as a says who it is that sayith unto thee that's that's the revelation of the gift of God in verse 11 the woman saith unto him sir thou Hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from Once then hast thou living water and of course Jesus here is he's he's not talking about the literal water but he he's he's talking about living water which is a a spiritual thing and he speaks like this a lot and there's many moments where you know Jesus is speaking and people seem to misunderstand what he's saying because you know they're more focused on the natural aspect and and simply similar to the disciples and how they're confused when he's talking about leaven and they're talking about bread and or the The Parables he would speak in they're they're they're often you know kind of questioning what what is he talking about and they're they're missing the Revelation and similar the woman here she's having the same issue where he's speaking in a certain way he's really speaking of the spiritual things of the deeper things and she's missing it because she's more focused on the natural aspect and and the purpose of him speaking this way he doesn't he doesn't speak without purpose he doesn't speak to confuse us but the purpose that Jesus speaking this way is really to call us to a higher level of Consciousness cuz we must become more spiritually minded than Earthly minded so he's trying to get us to to to a revelation to to to think lot not about bread you know not about wheat and tears and and and those things but really to understand what that means in the word and you know we can do our best to to live a good life but if we ignore the spiritual realm those evil spirits will inevitably consume us and will be help us to defend ourselves because our war is not with flesh and blood but it's with principalities and spiritual wickedness and you can't fight a war if you don't have the appropriate Weaponry for that war and you see this pattern throughout all of history you see man will make uh if if if your enemy has tanks you need to have your own tanks if your enemy has fighter jets you need to have your own fighter jets if you have a n they have a Navy you need to have a navy and and we see what's happened uh with you know when the atomic bombs were dropped now now every major superpower is going to have their own you know form of that so you you know that when you were in a war when you're in Warfare you need to have the appropriate Weaponry for that war and if we are to fight a spiritual war we cannot fight it with natural weapons we'll lose that war every time so that's what Jesus is always speaking in these ways and it might seem confusing sometimes and he's talking about you know the seeds and he's not talking about Farmers you know but and you have to get past the the metaphor the parable and then really get to the the deeper understanding of um of what he's trying to tell you and he's trying to give you these these weapons to to fight the spiritual battle that we're inevitably called to fight as Christians so and whenever Jesus is speaking this way you know it confuses people but he's trying to build their spiritual awareness to fight that spiritual battle because you really can't you can't defend yourself with the sword unless it's the sword of the spirit and you can't you know defend you can't you know fight with a shield unless it's the shield of Faith so you need you need those spiritual weapons and you'll notice that when you try to fight those those spiritual battles with natural weapons you'll lose almost immediately because if somebody you know is upset with you and you don't acknowledge or recognize that Spirit of anger then you are then going to react in anger and now you've both lost that spiritual battle now the spirit of anger is on you so you've lost that battle but if you if you understand the spiritual battle if you can look past the person and the situation and you can look to the spirit and say you know I see that person is upset they're angry but I'm not going to get upset with them and then and then and then now we're both consumed by the spirit but I'm going to I'm going to react with charity and kindness and patience and meekness and and and then you know you'll be able to preserve yourself from from losing that spiritual battle because you're going to lose that you're going to lose that battle if if you if you if you because you know they say uh misery loves company and we know that's true because brother brandom would speak of how he would Minister to spirits and then he'd say one spirit is trying to call out to another one to get help and that's misery that's misery wanting company that's that's that angry person you know people don't want to be angry by themselves they just look crazy so you can't be angry by yourself you often times if someone's angry at you and you just speak in a calm the demeanor though you'll see them also calm down as well cuz they they don't it's hard to be angry when someone's not angry with you so it's it's that it's that misery wanting company it's that Spirit wanting you know calling out for help you know and to see see if they can get a rise out of you and see if you'll lose that spiritual battle but if you react if you see the spirit and you react with weekness and and gentleness you know maybe the other person won't always calm down but you can preserve yourself from losing that spiritual battle and verse 12 art thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life and I really pray that's the testimony of every believer here that you know we maybe we had Earthly desires before and and we tried to fill our thirst with with with with something else but once you come here this is it this is the this is this is the end goal you've arrived when you finally get a revelation of the word and Jesus Christ and and the Bible and and the prophet and all these different things this is this is this is the satisfaction that you've been missing in your life and that you're not thinking about going back you're not you know once you really have a revelation of what this is you know that's the point of no return because there's nothing else for you in this life on once you really realize what this is there's nothing else for you in this life and you'll never even think about looking back not like Lot's wife not for anything not for your family Jesus said you must hate your family hate your friends you have to hate everything else and it's not necessarily A hate but it's you must prefer Jesus to everything else you must you must desire him more than you desire anything else more than your family more than your friends more than your loved ones more than anything on this Earth more than any money any any any power anything you could obtain you have to want that more amen that's why Jesus was able to overcome you know when Satan tried to tempt him with the things of the world and it's like it's silly really because it's once you have a revelation of what this is it's like whatever is on this Earth is just is meaningless so so you know it's like that song says you know it all it all grows dim in the light of his glory and grace so that should be our that should be our testimony and and the living water that Jesus is trying to offer this woman he's under the spiritual water of that that springing up into everlasting life that's the water he's trying to offer her and that's the water I pray that we've all received of today so verse 15 the woman 15 the woman say saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said I have no husband for thou Hast five husbands and he he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband and that sayest thou truly the woman said said unto him sir I perceive thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that in Jerusalem is the and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor ye at Jerusalem worship the father you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such worship such to worship him and I love that scripture you know he sees um that shall worship the father in spirit and truth and it goes back to that uh Jesus speaking in the way that he speaks because even brother brandom said you know or if believe the uh the Bible says God is a spirit so he must be worshiped spirit and truth and brother Brandon will refer to that scripture and say that's why we need to raise our spiritual awareness that's why we need to set our mind on Heavenly things because as God is a spirit needs to be worshiped in spirit and in truth you can't just worship Him in your own natural means and and the way that you think you should be worshiped but it has to be in spirit and in truth it has to be his spirit and make sure that that's the have the right Spirit on you when you worship and 24 God is a spirit oh there it is God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship him in spirit and Truth the woman saith unto him I know the messiah's come cometh is come he will tell us all things Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto thee am he and upon this came his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or Why th talkest thou with her and this is I'm sure it's some familiar scripture to most of us but one of the reasons I I really enjoy this story is believe it highlights the humility of Christ and not only did he descend into human flesh but then he also descended even further to talk to a woman who was completely lost and sinful and five different husbands and committing adultery in the way that she was living and a Samaritan nonetheless and then he descends even further you know when he when he goes to hell and sets the captives free and and he he he's never he's never you know too high Mighty to descend to those who need it and those who need help and even to this woman you know it doesn't matter if they're uh what their condition is he willing to descend to where they are and that's why we know when the Bible says you can't escape the love of God we know that's true because we see Jesus embodying every ounce of that scripture you know when you you can escape the love of God you see where this woman was in her life and and first he's a Samaritan and he's a Jew and then on top of that you know she's she's living the way she's living and even you know people who aren't maybe even maybe the Romans who who weren't who were worshiping pagan gods would even wouldn't even want to deal with someone who was as adulterous as she was but Jesus was willing to to come down and minister to her and you know I wish I wish we as people could sometimes see people the way God sees them and to really see the soul of a person you know because brother brandom said that a soul is worth 10,000 worlds so you know imagine if I had a bar of gold maybe and and I'd offered it to people and and it'd be hard to stop people from trying to rush and try to get to that bar of gold but if you imagine you know 10,000 planets made of pure gold and to imagine that that much gold and that much value is it within an individual soul and and we just walk past that every day you know or or like the Pharisees and disciples sometimes we we tend to look at the natural and we miss the spiritual and sometimes you know we look at worldly people and then we see tattoos and piercings or we see a pride flag and we deem those people as Unworthy of our time but maybe if we could see see past those things if we could see past the blind beggar if we could see past the prostitute or the Publican if we could see you know that there's a soul there that's thirsting for something you know there's thirsting for everlasting life and then then Jesus wouldn't then we wouldn't fear you know speaking to someone the way Jesus was wasn't afraid to speak to this woman no matter how low she was he wasn't afraid of that because he could see past her condition he could see her soul and he could see the value in that so if we could just see the value in the S Souls the way that Jesus could and you know we could in that way be the salt of the earth and and and and be able to minister to people if we weren't so you know we don't want to get too high- minded like the Pharisees were where where they just want to pray loud prayers in the synagogues and they want to wear you know fancy clothes and say that how blessed they are of God but just to be able to Humble enough to minister to anyone regardless of their condition you know and and I try to emphasis to this I try to emphasize this to my students a lot where um emphasizing the value of where where of a person an individual and where that comes from and that it's not in our appearances you know it's not in how fatter or skinny someone is or how taller short or rich or poor any of those things but it's really in the soul of an individual and and on this Earth You Get so distracted by the physical things and and all the fancy things but really we need to look at the the worth of an individual soul and that that's how God sees them it's not by their outward appearance but it's by the soul and if that Soul can be saved you've saved 10,000 worlds and that's an amazing thing and to have that understand that you know even when you're dealing with your brothers and sisters and and if there's disagreements you know understanding that you know the love should still be there for the love for for that person and the love for for their soul even if there's a disagreement on on Doctrine or whatever the case may be you should always want that person you know the best for that person and they want the the best for that person's soul and brother brandom said you know our first love should be God and then our second love is our fellow man and then we're like number third or fourth or wherever wherever else we are but it should always be looking to to God and to to other people and our fellow men and I'll call the musicians up as I end on this thought and I I just had to stop with the with the Valentine banquet coming up and maybe think about years ago when our church took a trip to Ohio and brother Isaac had this this nice car and apparently you know it was a it was special because it was they only made so many I think there was like a thousand or something they made but they only made so many cars and it's a lot you see that a lot in marketing in the world you see like they have a there's a big deal about exclusivity if if something feels rare you know they want to they want to Market that it's it's limited edition they really want to Market that cuz they only made so many and you know and I just thought like if the think that people can value a car that that's one in a thousand you know where a few models were made but we take for granted people that exist on Earth who are one of one you know cuz God doesn't remake Souls you know even if you could find someone identical to you if there's identical twins people who look exactly alike they talk alike they act likee they dress alike they have two separate Souls that's right no matter what and God doesn't remake Souls there so every individual is one of one and you know there will never ever be another you it doesn't matter you know how alike someone is every individual is one of one and to think that God you know could take two PE completely Unique Individuals and then put them together in in a marriage and think about how special that is and you can take someone who's one of one and can take someone else who's one of one and then put them together and I hope everyone who's married you know at some point you can look at your partner and tell them no you are one of one and just thank God for putting someone in your life who can minister to your needs in a way that only they can so God bless you amen [Applause]
